This is usually done to eliminate the need to rebuild sets and re-hire actors for sequels, and maintain audience interest in the film series. Films produced this way usually have a well-planned pipeline, where the first film may be in post-production as the second is being shot. While sometimes a trilogy such as The Lord of the Rings is shot with all three parts back-to-back, it is much more common for only two parts to be shot this way. Often, in a trilogy, the first film will be made on its own, and if it is a success, the remaining two parts will be produced back-to-back. This approach was pioneered by the second and third parts of the Sleepaway Camp trilogy, and has since been applied to the Back to the Future and The Matrix trilogies. Back to the Future Part II, and later, The Matrix Reloaded both ended with the words \\"To be concluded,\\" a variant on the traditional \\"To be continued,\\" and a trailer for their respective upcoming sequels.

In some traditional bluegrass bands, the guitar rarely takes the lead, instead acting as a rhythm instrument, one notable exception being gospel-based songs. Melodies and lyrics tend to be simple, often in the key of G, and a I-IV-V chord pattern is common. Although traditional bluegrass performers do not use electrically amplified instruments, as used in other forms of popular music, it is common practice to \\"mike\\" acoustic instruments during stage performances before larger audiences. Bill Monroe's mandolin playing style and Kenny Baker's fiddling set the standard for traditional bluegrass musicians on those instruments. Earl Scruggs is recognized as the developer of bluegrass three finger style banjo playing.Trischka, Tony, \\"The Mainstream\\", in Banjo Song Book, Oak Publications, 1977 There are ideological divisions even among traditional bluegrass bands. These divisions center on the longstanding debate about what constitutes \\"Bluegrass Music\\". A few traditional bluegrass musicians do not consider progressive bluegrass to truly be \\"bluegrass\\", some going so far as to suggest bluegrass must be styled directly after Bill Monroe's bands. However, stylistic divergences in traditional bluegrass generally center on which first generation bands from which contemporary musicians have drawn inspiration. Examples include bands who sing in the Stanley Brothers tradition: Roy Lee Centers, Larry Sparks, Sammy Adkins, The Fields Bros, The Wilson Brothers, The Gillis Brothers and various local bands across the country. Other bands followed Lester Flatt, such as Willis Spears, Curley Seckler and Karl Shifflett. Mac Wiseman's \\"crooning\\" style of Bluegrass engendered Hylo Brown and Sid Campbell. The Osborne Brothers have followers in Larry Stephenson as well as the Grascals. Frank Necessary, Blue Maggie and Hud Hadley were strongly influenced by Jimmy Martin.

Life and career The daughter of Hungarian immigrants, Kober was born in Yorkville, a neighborhood on Manhattan's Upper East Side. She attended Hunter College High School, and in the summer of 1924, she placed third in a New York City scholarship contest. The $100-a-year prize helped her to attend Hunter College,Fox, 90. where she majored in Latin, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated magna cum laude.Margalit Fox, The Riddle of the Labyrinth, chapter four, location 1149 of the Kindle edition She earned a master's degree in classics at Columbia University in 1929 and a PhD in 1932.Fox, 91. While working on her doctorate, Kober taught at Hunter High and Hunter College and, in 1930, became an assistant professor of classics at Brooklyn College, where she remained for the rest of her career.Fox, 91. A former student, Eva Brann, wrote that Kober was \\"aggressively nondescript....Her figure dumpy with sloping shoulders, her chin heavily determined, her hair styled for minimum maintenance, her eyes behind bottle-bottom glasses snapped impatiently and twinkled not unkindly.\\"Eva Brann, \\"In Memoriam: Alice E. Kober,\\" unpublished manuscript, University of Texas, Austin, quoted in Fox, 91. On campus she shared an office with four other faculty members and served on standard committees. After teaching herself Braille, she translated textbooks, library materials, and final exams for blind students at Brooklyn College.Fox, 109-100. Kober never married, and no evidence exists to indicate a rich personal life. Kober lived with her widowed mother and, so far as is known, never had a romantic partner.Fox, 92. Linear B A Linear B tablet found in 300px A descendant of a Minoan script, the tablets documenting Linear B were discovered by Arthur Evans at Knossos in the early 1900s. Although Evans was reluctant to release access to the physical tablets, he published Scripta Minoa, a book outlining his hypotheses on the tablets. Beginning in the 1930s, Kober privately studied Linear B, as yet an undeciphered script of an unidentified Aegean language of the Bronze Age, keeping massive statistics on 180,000 hand-cut cards and tabulations in forty notebooks.Fox, 93, 104-06. Kober used a hand punch to create a kind of \\"database, with the punched holes marking the parameters on which the data could be sorted.\\"Fox, 108. She also mastered a host of languages, ancient and modern, including Hittite, Old Irish, Akkadian, Tocharian, Sumerian, Old Persian, Basque and Chinese. From 1942 to 1945, while teaching full-time in Brooklyn, she commuted weekly by train to Yale to take classes in advanced Sanskrit. She also studied field archeology in New Mexico.Fox, 115. In 1946, Kober received a one-year Guggenheim Fellowship to study Linear B full-time.Fox, 113. Making the acquaintance of John Linton Myres, she gained access to many more Linear B inscriptions collected by the archaeologist of Knossos, Sir Arthur Evans, and hand copied most of them at Oxford University in 1947.Fox, 128. Kober's major discovery was that Linear B was an inflected language, difficult to write in a syllabic script.Fox, 134. Further progress in deciphering the language was delayed by her renewed teaching duties and the thankless job of proofreading and correcting Myres's Scripta Minoa.Fox, 178. A chain smoker, Kober died, probably of cancer, in 1950 at the age of 43.Fox, 191. A much younger cousin said that it was whispered in the family that she had died of a rare form of stomach cancer. After her death, the architect Michael Ventris built on Kober's work and with some inspired guesses deciphered the script in 1952, establishing that it was Mycenaean Greek. Correspondence and papers Kober's extensive correspondence and papers, including support for her search for inflections in Linear B, are available online at the Program for Aegean Scripts & Prehistory (PASP) at the University of Texas at Austin: Alice E.

It is a sequel to the 1982 film They Call Me Bruce?  Plot  The film begins with Bruce in Houston on a search for the American G.I. that helped the young Bruce when he was just a child in Korea. With little more than a name and a fuzzy memory of his hero, Bruce is determined to find G.I. Ernie Brown to thank and repay him with an antique Korean vase. After following a few dead end leads, Bruce meets the students of a local karate studio who introduce him to their martial arts master, Master McLean. Thinking Bruce to be a karate master, McLean convinces Bruce to run the studio in his place while he takes care of some business. Bruce, accepting the role, dons a black belt and with his own goofy yet clever tricks convinces the students of his skills. While teaching, Bruce develops a bond with a young orphan and student, Billy, and eventually takes up a fatherly role and begins to mentor him. During his free time, Bruce continues his search for Ernie Brown, which leads him to the massage parlor of the crime boss Mr. B. Before he can even meet with him, Bruce steps up in defense of Polly, one of the girls on Mr. B's payroll. Thwarting Mr. B's goon from harassing her, Bruce and Polly make a quick exit, Bruce unfortunately leaving his antique vase behind. The goons, fearful of the wrath of their boss, decide to give the vase to Mr. B as a gift in hopes his fury will be diminished. Upon seeing the vase, Mr. B develops a strange look as he exclaims that he has not seen a vase like it since the Korean War. Bruce plays a game of hide and seek as the goons try their best to track down Polly, all the while in the background being followed by a detective investigating Mr. B. There are many near misses and humorous situations, as Bruce and Polly evade the goons and try to recover the vase; including a dancer challenging Bruce's skills in a club, to Bruce's misunderstanding and misusing of a gesture that he gives to a motorcycle gang, and even a mad bull that gives Bruce a ride into town. The climax begins when Mr. B's goons finally locate and kidnap Polly and knock over young Billy, causing him to hit his head and go into a coma. With his young friend in a coma, Bruce sets out to find and rescue Polly. Unfortunately, Bruce is discovered during his attempt and confronted by Mr. B. Upon hearing the goons exaggerated claims of Bruce's skill, Mr. B makes Bruce a deal to pit Bruce against his champion fighter‚Äîthe Executioner‚Äîwith the agreement that if he wins, Polly and the vase will be returned. Bruce accepts the challenge and is soon in the ring, face to face with the massive and brutal Executioner. Of course, due to his lack of skill and the threat of Mr. B, Bruce is no match for the brutal fighter. However, at the last moment Billy, having awakened from his coma and seeing Bruce fighting on television, wobbles to the ring and inspires his mentor to put on a sock and \\"Sock It To Him\\". With this new determination, Bruce defeats the Executioner. Mr. B, unhappy with Bruce's win, tries to go back on his deal, but is quickly surprised and arrested by the investigating detective. Polly and Billy, joining Bruce in the ring, return his vase and congratulate Bruce on his victory. Much to their surprise, Bruce seems unhappy and he reveals the realization that Mr. B was his childhood hero Ernie Brown. However, much to Bruce's surprise, the detective rushes into the ring and, calling Bruce by the name his hero gave him, announces he is actually the Ernie \\"Slim\\" Brown that Bruce had met as a child, but could not reveal this earlier due to being deep undercover. The reunion is sweet and swift; Bruce thanks him, gives him the vase, and the credits roll.

It was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1990.  Uses  It is indicated for use as a single agent in the palliative treatment of patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer following first-line therapy with cisplatin and/or alkylating agent- based combination. It is not considered a first-line treatment, but it can be useful as salvage therapy. It also has the advantage of being less toxic than other drugs used for treating refractory ovarian cancer.  Mechanism  The precise mechanism by which altretamine exerts its anti-cancer effect is unknown but it is classified by MeSH as an alkylating antineoplastic agent. This unique structure is believed to damage tumor cells through the production of the weakly alkylating species formaldehyde, a product of CYP450-mediated N-demethylation. Administered orally, altretamine is extensively metabolized on first pass, producing primarily mono- and didemethylated metabolites. Additional demethylation reactions occur in tumor cells, releasing formaldehyde in situ before the drug is excreted in the urine. The carbinolamine (methylol) intermediates of CYP450-mediated metabolism also can generate electrophilic iminium species that are capable of reacting covalently with DNA guanine and cytosine residues as well as protein. Iminium-mediated DNA cross-linking and DNA-protein interstrand cross-linking, mediated through both the iminium intermediate and formaldehyde, have been demonstrated, although the significance of DNA cross-linking on altretamine antitumor activity is uncertain.  Side effects  Side effects include nausea, vomiting, anemia and peripheral sensory neuropathy.Drugs.com: Altretamine Monograph  Interactions  Combination with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) decreases neurotoxicity but has been found to reduce the effectiveness of an altretamine/cisplatin regime. MAO inhibitor can cause severe orthostatic hypotension when combined with altretamine; and cimetidine can increase its elimination half-life and toxicity.

It had a population of 2,648 (2001 census) and 2,704 in 2008. It is southeast of Huddersfield and northwest of Barnsley. It is in the parish of Clayton West and High Hoyland. An attractive stone-built village, there is also a little light industry and a number of new housing developments. Facilities in the village include a village store and two pubs. It has a primary school and nursery called Kayes First and Nursery School, which was built in 1862, and was doubled in size in 1981. Kayes First and Nursery School consists of 202 children and 32 staff from Nursery to year 5 (2017 figures). The school is also part of a three tier schooling system with Scissett Middle School and Shelley College (formally Shelley High School). It also has a Scout Group which offers access to a number of outdoor activities including archery, target shooting, kayaking and much more. Clayton West is located between the villages of High Hoyland, Scissett and Skelmanthorpe. The river that runs through the village is called the River Dearne and was part of the 2007 United Kingdom floods. The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. The Industrial Revolution had brought a migration of the population to the Dearne Valley where abundant water was available for manufacturers, so people lived away from the church. Both Clayton West and Scissett had grown so rapidly that there were people still alive in 1873 that could remember the expansion. Although the parish of Scissett had been created in 1839, yet Clayton West remained as a part of High Hoyland. By 1865 eleven coal mines existed in the Dearne Valley. The Clayton West village coal mine (pit), \\"Park Mill\\", closed in 1989, having been somewhat bypassed by the events of the UK miners strike (1984-85). Park Mill Colliery operated for over 100 years. There is evidence of 700 years of mining in the adjacent village of Emley. Records from the 13th century indicate that monks from Byland Abbey mined and smelted iron ore. They mined using bell pits. A pit was sunk to a depth of 7 meters and worked outward from the bottom of the shaft. Pits dating back to the 16th century can be seen off Woodhouse Lane. Evidence of bell pits is also clearly visible in the woodlands around Duke Wood, down the hill from Cliffe Woods, in Clayton West. Joseph Norton was the owner of a number of mines around the 1870s which he used to mine to produce coal to power his textile mills located at Cuttlehurst and in Scissett. One of these was a mine in Duke Wood. This shaft still acts as an emergency exit and air vent for the privately owned \\"Flacks\\" mine, the only mine still operating in the village. The village once had a railway station on a branch line, opening 1 September 1879, branching off the Penistone Line. However the station along with Skelmanthorpe was closed in January 1983. The Kirklees Light Railway now runs and operates trains from the former station. Clayton West was occasionally used as a location for Britain's longest running comedy series Last of the Summer Wine, in which one of the village's former pubs, \\"The Shoulder of Mutton\\" in Church Lane, features prominently. The village lost its post office in 2010. All Saints Church, on Church Lane, dates back to 1875 and is still in use today. It belongs to the Diocese of Wakefield. All Saints cost ¬£2,300 to construct between 1872 and 1875. Half of the cost was met by the parish, the other half by WB Beaumont of Bretton Hall (later to be Baron Allendale), the church's patron and benefactor. All Saints can be seen from many places around the village, the only building with a spire, which houses one bell. The roof slates of the church were last replaced in the early 1980s, following a slate appeal when raffle tickets were sold to raise funds for the roof replacement, the spire was also repainted and reclad at this time. In 2019 the roof is again in need of major restoration. Historical Listings Clayton West is listed as Clayton [West in the Domesday book] and has been translated as meaning settlement on clayey soil. The settlement had a land value attributed to the Lord of ¬£1 in 1066. Plough land is also listed as being two, with other resources listed as woodland, one half times one half leagues. The Lord in 1066 is stated to be Alsi, son of Karski. The Lord in 1086, following the conquest, was listed as Ilbert de Lacy (1045-1093) and is attributed as the builder of Pontefract Castle, who is also noted as the Tenant-in-Chief in 1086. The de Lacy family took part in the Norman Conquest of Briton and there is evidence that Ilbert fought at William's side at Hastings. Listed as Clayton, West, the village featured in \\"A Topographical Dictionary of England\\" which was published by Samuel Lewis, London, 1848. In 1848 the village had 1440 residents and was described as being 1080 acres belonging to various owners. Mining was listed as the predominant industry, along with the production of silk and worsted goods for clothing. The account states that many large mills had been constructed in the village for this purpose. In 1848 the four places of worship were listed. Listed as CLAYTON (West), in John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870‚Äì72). Clayton West is described as a township of the High Hoyland parish with hamlets of Cuttlehurst, Parkmill, Topitt and Spring-Grove. The village has a post office and comprises 1,098 acres, with real-estate worth ¬£4, 371, ¬£122 of which are in mines. The population is now listed as 1,532, with 325 houses. Woollen manufacture is again listed as a pre-dominant industry. Chapels are listed for independents (constructed in 1866) and Baptists. Further information of the progressing village is delineated in Kelly's 1881 Directory of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It describes \\"Clayton West\\" as a township and large village. The manufacture of fancy woollens, as well as twine and flax spinning seems to be the prevalent industry of the village. The church of All Saints, constructed in 1875, is now listed along with Congregational, Baptist, New Connexion Methodist, Primitive Methodist and Wesleyan chapels. Kelly lists the charities for distribution as being ¬£13 annually . Also mentioned is the un- denominational school (Kaye's First School) built by William and John Kaye esqs., which was erected in 1862, and in 1881 William Priestly was school master. Capt. Henry Savile is lord of the manor. The main landowners are listed as W. B. Beaumont esq., M.P. W. T. Spencer-Stanhope esq., J.P. John Kaye esq., J.P. and Thomas Norton esq. J.P. The area occupied by the village is now 1,140 acres with rateable value, ¬£4,548. The population in 1871 was 1,531. Textile Mills One such mill, the Spring Grove Mill, still has buildings visible, just off the A636, opposite the Scissett swimming baths building. Locally is it still known as Beanlands Mill, named after the Beanland family who purchased the business in 1869 from Charles Walker for ¬£8,500. The mill stopped operating as such in 1975, and the mill chimney has since been removed along with other buildings. Pictures of the Mill are available. War Memorial The village has an obelisk style war memorial, now situated at the junction of Church Lane with Holmfield Road. The memorial commemorates 37 people, 30 from the First World War, six from the Second World War and one from the Falklands War. The war memorial used to be located on the grass triangle at Hill Top. Flooding In 2007 severe flooding of the river Dearne affected some 420 properties in Clayton West and Skelmanthorpe. Summer flooding has also occurred in the area in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2008. The textile industry history of the area has resulted in modern-day conversions of old textile mill to become residential accommodation. The valley floor also has a high density of residential properties making these areas more prone to flooding. Future Development Plans, dated December 2016, are available detailing proposed developments by the Clayton West Development Company Ltd (CWDCL), who are promoting the development of green belt land at the north eastern edge of Clayton West.

Definition The term professional audio has no precise definition, but it typically includes: * Operations carried out by trained audio engineers * The capturing of sound with one or more microphones * Balancing, mixing and adjusting sound signals from multitrack recording devices using a mixing console * The control of audio levels using standardised types of metering * Sound signals passing through lengthy signal chains involving processes at different times and places, involving a variety of skills * Compliance with organisational, national and international practices and standards established by such bodies as the International Telecommunication Union, Audio Engineering Society and European Broadcasting Union * Setting up or designing sound reinforcement systems or recording studios Stores A professional audio store is a retail establishment that sells, and in many cases rents, expensive, high-end sound recording equipment (microphones, audio mixers, digital audio recorders, speakers and surround sound speakers, monitor speakers) and sound reinforcement system gear (e.g., speaker enclosure cabinets, stage monitor speakers, power amplifiers, subwoofer cabinets) and accessories used in both settings, such as microphone stands. Some pro audio stores also sell video equipment, such as video projectors, as this equipment is commonly used in live audio settings (e.g., business presentations and conventions). Some pro audio stores also sell and/or rent DJ gear (record turntables, DJ mixers) and the stage lighting equipment used in rock concerts, dance clubs, raves and theater/musical theater shows.

It is 14 km (8 mi) south east of Huddersfield and 16 km (10 mi) north west of Barnsley. According to the 2001 census, the village had a population of 1,324. Scissett is halfway between the villages of Clayton West, Skelmanthorpe and Denby Dale on the A636 road to Wakefield. River Dearne runs through the village, which was affected by the 2007 United Kingdom floods. Northonthorpe Mills, formerly premises of woollen manufacturers Scissett grew up around the woollen industry in the 19th century as mill owners built houses in the area for their workers. The nearby coalfields also provided employment. These industries are now gone and some of the mills are now retail units. The Scissett Baths (and leisure centre) is one of the main attractions for the surrounding area. Scissett has first and middle schools to provide education for children ages 4 to 13. Scissett Youth Band began life in the village in 1978 but moved to Shelley Methodist Hall in 1991. Sport Scissett is home to two sports clubs, Scissett Football ClubScissett Football Club and Nortonthorpe Cricket Club. Both play at Nortonthorpe sports club which was donated by the Norton family who owned the local mills at the time. When George Norton left the family home (Bagden Hall) to live in Nortonthorpe Hall he chose to outline a deed of trust, which specified that the seven and a half acres of land, which currently form the cricket and football pitch, could only be used for the recreational purposes of the community. This is largely the reason behind the cricket club being called Nortonthorpe instead of Scissett. Etymology The etymology is doubtful, although some sources suggest it may be from Old English side \\"hillside, talus, slope\\" (related to Old Norse si√∞a, of similar meaning), but nothing is confirmed. The first element is uncertain. However, another source claims a completely different etymology, that it was named after \\"Scissett Wood\\", itself named after a woman.

Norra Botkyrka was until the 1970s an agricultural community with only a few inhabitants consisting of a few large estates (Norsborg, Hallunda, Slagsta, Fittja and Alby) and a large protected area around the Lake Bornsj√∂ which was and still is a reserve for the drinking water supply for the city of Stockholm. Within a few years during the 1970s, the municipalities of Stockholm and Botkyrka cooperated to build a \\"New Town\\" for more than 30,000 inhabitants. The idea of a new town concept for Norra Botkyrka was influenced by new towns in the United Kingdom. During archeological excavations prior to the building of the \\"New Town\\" there were found a number of rock carvings in the Slagsta area indicating that there was an agricultural population here already during the Bronze Age. During excavations conducted under the guidance of the Historic Museum of Stockholm there were found in the Hallunda area Bronze Age dwellings together with a number of bronze smelting hearths and ceramic remains from Central Europe showing that there must have been far reaching trading relations already this early. Already from early historic times the trunkroad from Stockholm to the continent passed through Norra Botkyrka. There are now also four stations on the Stockholm Metro here: Norsborg, Hallunda, Alby and Fittja. The area was made famous in the late 1990s through the local hip hop group called The Latin Kings who often refers to this area in their lyrics. It is also known as one of the most multi-cultural places in Sweden with a majority of the population being first or second generation immigrants. Most of these originate from the Middle East with other significant groups from for example Turkey, Chile, Finland, former Yugoslavia, China, Pakistan and the Horn of Africa.

Life Christo was born on 25 August 1944 in Belo Horizonte. At the age of 20, when he was a student of journalism, he entered the Dominican Order. He was later imprisoned for four years by the military dictatorship which ruled Brazil for smuggling people out of country. His incarceration was part of an ongoing series of attacks by the government on activist members of the Roman Catholic Church. In addition to work on eliminating hunger in Brazil, Christo is involved in various aspects of Brazil's politics. He worked for the government of Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, for whom he was considered a spiritual advisor and mentor. As a liberation theologian, Christo has been involved in various international efforts in order to support an understanding between Marxism and Christianity. During the 1980s, he visited Havana and held frequent and lengthy interviews with Fidel Castro, the result of such talks being a book, Fidel and Religion, where Castro exposed his views on Christianity, something that raised protest among conservatives but is also said to have improved relations between Castro's government and the Cuban Catholic Church. During Mikhail Gorbachev's Perestroika, Christo was also involved in various efforts aimed at an understanding between leaders of Russian Orthodox Church and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, such efforts being described in the form of a travelogue published by him in 1993 in Portuguese, Lost Paradise, which the author dedicates to a certain Theophilus (\\"God's friend\\"), apparently the same as the mysterious addressee of the Gospel of Luke, which should be understood as a symbol of all Christians.Marcelo Thimoteo da Costa, \\"Um √âden no Leste?

Produced by U2's Larry Mullen, it featured an intro by Moya Brennan. The song was created by Larry Mullen Jnr, Denis Woods, John Donnelly. Engineered by John Grimes who was assisted by Colin O‚ÄôMahony. It also featured Davy Spillane on the Uilleann pipes. The Jack Charlton soundbites were captured by Colin O‚ÄôMahony from reels of archived radio interviews. The chorus was by performed by some U2 fans that were hanging about outside studio 3 on Windmill Lane in Dublin. There was an attempt to record the team but it was a disaster. Somebody had the great idea of using beer to loosen up the team's vocal cords. Anthony \\"Anto\\" Drennan is credited with playing lead guitar on the single. He actually recorded it in a single take which is very unusual. It is often assumed that the guitar intro was a straight sampling of \\"Dearg Doom\\" by the Horslips; however this is not the case. The Horslips song \\"Dearg Doom\\", was itself based on the traditional Irish tune, O' Neill's March, (which appeared as Marcshlua U√≠ N√©ill on Sean O Riada's 1969 album \\"O'Riada sa Gaiety\\",) and which refers to Hugh O'Neill and his part in The Nine Year War. Thanks to this song the title became a catchphrase of then manager Jack Charlton, whose soundbites were sampled for the verse; the chorus was a combination of the familiar football chant \\"Ol√© Ol√© Ol√©\\" and a reworking of \\"Ally's Tartan Army\\" (which was itself set to the tune of \\"God Save Ireland\\"), the unofficial theme tune for Scotland in the 1978 FIFA World Cup, and for 13 weeks the song was at number one in the Irish Singles Chart.Keane, Trevor (1 Oct 2010).

The organisation provides opportunities for training and conferencing to assist in maintaining high standards in all areas of professional audio operations. The organisation is based in the UK. The organisation was founded in 1977 by sound balancers in BBC Television and Radio and Independent TV, when its membership comprised audio practitioners working in all areas of broadcast audio including radio, location, and post-production sound. On 1 January 2012 the Institute of Professional Sound was adopted as the new name of the organisation, in order to attract a wider membership which is not exclusively from broadcasting.  History  The Institute of Professional Sound was established in 1977 as the Institute of Broadcast Sound, by individuals working in radio and television, who recognised a need for a coordinated means for the exchange of innovative ideas between practitioners in the field of broadcast audio. The organisation serves as a catalyst to promote collaborative initiatives between manufacturers of digital audio recording and editing equipment. Listed among the successes of the organisation is the File Exchange Initiative, from which the iXML specification was established, setting an open standard for the inclusion of location sound metadata in Broadcast Wave audio files.  Projects  = Mentoring = The Institute of Professional Sound offers mentoring and career enhancement opportunities for entry-level employees, college graduates, and seasoned professionals. The mentoring program is designed to coordinate members who desire to assist their colleagues progress and succeed in their career with individuals seeking the advice and support of more experienced practitioners in the industry. = Training = The organisation provides training forums and conferences for its members which introduce members to emerging technologies, along with seminars on microphone placement and other operational issues. = Ofcom radio frequency spectrum = The Institute contributes to the ongoing discussions with Ofcom, regarding the changes to the management and use of the radio frequency spectrum, where it represents several hundred members who are independent users of radio microphone and associated equipment. = Email conferencing = Started in June 1995 with just 10 participants, the IPS's Internet email conference IBSNET has over 500 participants (as of 2012). Members include individuals from the UK, Germany, Austria, United States, Malaysia, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. The conference provides opportunities for comment and feedback regarding professional standards, working conditions, visa requirements, and radio microphone frequencies in other countries, in addition to putting location recordists in contact with one another and with the dubbing mixers, who may ultimately use their work.

D. James's detective novels.  Education  Marsden attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and spent four terms there. He attempted to unionise the students but was thwarted. After one argument he poured a bottle of ink down the front of the director's suit. Marsden recalled, \\"Two weeks later, he phoned me up and asked if I'd got a job or an agent. I said no, so he arranged for me to start work at a theatre in Nottingham, and who should be the student assistant manager there but Anthony Hopkins. I persuaded him to go to RADA.\\"  Stage  In the early 1960s, Marsden worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company and began to accumulate an extensive list of theatrical credits that include everything from Anton Chekhov and Henrik Ibsen to contemporary Soviet playwright Alexander Vampilov. His preference was for the alternative experimental theatres of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Cambridge and Birmingham over London's commercial theatre. His appearances include Crispen in The Friends, 1970; Casca and Lucilius in Julius Caesar, 1972; Paul Schippel in Schippel, 1974; Heinrich Krey in The Plumber's Progress, 1975. He also played Long John Silver in Treasure Island at London's Mermaid Theatre around Christmas for two years and Henry Higgins in Pygmalion at the Albery Theatre. In 2008, Marsden appeared in two productions, Murder on Air and Happy Jack at the Theatre Royal, Windsor.  Television  His prominent television roles include George Osborne in a 1967 adaptation of Vanity Fair and the title role of Arthur Chipping in 1984's Goodbye Mr. Chips. Marsden has also appeared as a guest in The New Avengers, Space: 1999, Only Fools and Horses (\\"Little Problems\\"), Foyle's War and Tales of the Unexpected. Marsden starred in Yorkshire Television's 1978‚Äì1980 Cold War espionage series The Sandbaggers. He played Neil Burnside, the dour and fiercely protective Director of Operations in the Secret Intelligence Service, whose character spent as much time infighting with his superiors in Whitehall and his own department as it did battling the KGB. The show ran for three series and 20 episodes. In 1982, Yorkshire Television cast him in Airline, a series in which he played Jack Ruskin, a scrappy Second World War pilot trying to start his own post-war airline against establishment opposition. It also starred his wife, Polly Hemingway, who was pregnant with their first child during most of the filming. In an interview, Marsden said \\"It was one of the most enjoyable programmes I ever made. Learning to fly those old DC-3s was terrific. And I enjoyed playing Ruskin enormously because he had hope. Of course, he was a pain up the tushie most of the time, but then you'd see that youthful desire to actually get out and triumph against enormous odds. I identified with that character the most.\\" Marsden's portrayal of Adam Dalgliesh in Anglia TV's P.D. James series spanned fifteen years. The series began as adaptations played out in serials of five or six one-hour episodes each, which were, unusually for the time, recorded on outside broadcast videotape as opposed to film: *Death of an Expert Witness (1983); *Shroud for a Nightingale (1984); *Cover Her Face (1985); *The Black Tower (1985); *A Taste for Death (1988); *Devices and Desires (1991). After producer John Rosenberg died in early 1991 (during the transmission run of Devices and Desires), the format of the adaptations changed. Initially, Anglia followed the trend made popular by the Inspector Morse series, condensing the next two adaptations into two-hour filmed TV films. *Unnatural Causes (1993); *A Mind to Murder (1995). The final two adaptations were filmed in three one- hour episodes: *Original Sin (1997); *A Certain Justice (1998). The Dalgliesh role was taken by Martin Shaw when the BBC took over the rights to James's novels and produced its own series. In 1993, Marsden appeared in The Last Vampyre, a feature-length episode of Sherlock Holmes. In 2006 he played Ted Cartwright, a veterinarian, in \\"Bad Blood\\", episode 2 of the fourth season of Foyle's War. Marsden presented a nine-part crime documentary series Roy Marsden's Casebook for ITV West in 2007. He also appeared in a 2007 episode of Doctor Who as Mr Stoker, a medical consultant. In 2008, he appeared in ITV series The Palace as King Richard's private secretary, Sir Iain Ratalick. Marsden reprised his Only Fools and Horses role in 2009 as one of the Driscoll brothers in the spin-off series, The Green Green Grass. He also appeared in the television film Margaret (2009) as Norman Tebbit. In 2010 Marsden appeared in an episode of New Tricks, and in 2011 in an episode of Silent Witness. He played Commander Haydock in the 2016 adaptation of Agatha Christie's N or M?, a three-episode part of the BBC's Partners in Crime serial.  Film  His film credits include Toomorrow (1970), a small part as an SS officer in The Eagle Has Landed (1976), The Squeeze (1977), and as Oberon in Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God (2005).

He was educated in Germany. From 1849 to 1854 he was private Secretary to his uncle, the Liberal Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Between 1857 and 1885, he sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tavistock. He only spoke rarely in the Commons, once in reply to an attack on his brother, Odo. On 25 September 1865, Russell married Laura de Peyronnet, daughter of Paul Louis Jules, Vicomte de Peyronnet. Together they had six children, Harold Russell, Flora Russell, the diplomat Sir Claud Russell, Caroline Russell, Major Gilbert Russell and Conrad Russell. He was raised to the rank of a Duke's son on 25 June 1872 and was then known as Lord Arthur Russell. He was a great clubman and belonged to Brooks's, the Athenaeum, the Cosmopolitan, Grillion's, THE CLUB, and the Metaphysical Society. He was involved in the Senate of the University of London, serving on this body from 1875 until before his death. Russell died on 4 April 1892, at 2 Audley Square, London and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. There is a memorial to him in the 'Bedford Chapel' at St. Michael's Church, Chenies. The ideological gulf between Britain and the new German Empire was stressed by Lord Russell in 1872: :Prussia now represents all that is most antagonistic to the liberal and democratic ideas of the age; military despotism, the rule of the sword, contempt for sentimental talk, indifference to human suffering, imprisonment of independent opinion, transfer by force of unwilling populations to a hateful yoke, disregard of European opinion, total want of greatness and generosity, etc., etc.\\" References   External links  * 1825 births 1892 deaths Burials at Brompton Cemetery Members of The Club A Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies UK MPs 1857‚Äì1859 UK MPs 1859‚Äì1865 UK MPs 1865‚Äì1868 UK MPs 1868‚Äì1874 UK MPs 1874‚Äì1880 UK MPs 1880‚Äì1885 Younger sons of dukes Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Tavistock ","title":"Lord Arthur Russell"},{"id":"4037530","text":"Suna Kƒ±ra√ß (born Suna Ko√ß; June 3, 1941 ‚Äì September 15, 2020) was a Turkish businesswoman and a billionaire.

Bourne's rendering is best known for having the traditionally female parts of the swans danced by men. It was the longest- running ballet in London's West End and on Broadway. First staged at Sadler's Wells theatre in London in 1995, it has been performed in the UK, Los Angeles, Europe, Russia, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Israel, and Singapore.\\"The History of Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake\\", from the programme from Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake at Sadler's Wells, London, 13 December 2006 ‚Äì 21 January 2007.  Synopsis  This synopsis is derived from programme notes and the synopsis provided on the DVD.. The plot of the ballet revolves around a young crown prince, his distant mother, and his desire for freedom, represented by a swan. = Act I = In the prologue, the Prince, as a child, is awakened by a nightmare of a swan. The Prince's mother comes in to comfort him, but becoming nervous by the situation's intimacy, leaves. Scene 1 opens with the Prince being prepared for a day of official duties by chambermaids and valets. In Scene 2, arrayed in his full dress uniform, the Prince becomes bored by a boat christening, a ribbon cutting, and other official tasks. His mother prods him to keep up appearances, even as she devotes more attention to the soldiers than she does to him. During this scene, there is a transition from the child actor playing the young Prince to the identically-dressed adult dancer who portrays the grown Prince. This now-adult Prince is introduced to a girl called \\"the Girlfriend\\". Although the girl seems foisted on him by von Rothbart, the Private Secretary, the Prince prefers her to his duty-bound life. In Scene 3, the Queen, one of her admiring soldiers, the Private Secretary, the Prince, and the Girlfriend all appear in a theatre box, where they watch a ballet that is staged for the actual audience as well as for the characters. The ballet's backdrop (from a design for Castle Falkenstein by Christian Jank), ornate costumes, and acting parody the romantic ballets of which the original Swan Lake was an example. The Girlfriend's responses to the dance as well as her eventual dropping her purse from the royal box annoy the Queen and von Rothbart. Scene 4 finds the Prince drinking in his private chambers in front of a mirror, to his mother's shock. A nearly violent pas de deux ensues in which he pleads for her attention and love, while she rebukes him. The Prince then goes into the streets and into the Swank Bar, a 1970s-style disco, in Scenes Five and Six. Here is where the choreography veers from classical ballet, with jazz forms and modern dance dominating. The Prince gets into a fight with sailors at the bar, and he is thrown out into the street. In Scene Seven, he sees the Girlfriend being paid off by von Rothbart, and he is totally shattered to discover that the only person who appeared to love him is a fake. This increases his desperation and he vows to kill himself. While sitting in the street at the end of Scene Seven the Prince imagines a group of swans flying towards him but the vision disappears. It is the first flash of the Prince's descent into mental turmoil. = Act II = Distraught and disappointed that he will never find affection, the Prince writes a suicide note and goes to throw himself into a lake at a public park inhabited by swans. He is saved by a vision in which he encounters the lead Swan, who had appeared to him in his dreams. Initially rejected by the lead Swan, the Prince is gradually accepted and taken into the Swan's arms. The Prince is elated and abandons his plan to kill himself. This Act contains the most talked-about element of the ballet in which bare-chested, barefoot male dancers play the swans, and it contains a very sensual pas de deux between the lead Swan and the Prince. = Act III = Scene 1 begins with princesses from various European nations and their escorts arriving at the palace gates for a grand ball. The Girlfriend sneaks in amongst them. Scene 2 takes place in a ballroom. It commences with the arrival of the Queen and the Prince and some formal dancing, but quickly degenerates into a debauched party of drinking and lascivious come-ons. Into this arrives the charismatic and sexually aggressive son of von Rothbart, the Private Secretary, in black leather trousers, who intensifies the sexual tension even further by flirting with every woman present, including the Queen. Each woman finds herself drawn to him and actively participates in the mutual, sometimes lewd, flirtation. Just as in the original Swan Lake, where customarily (although not always) one ballerina performs the roles of both the white swan (Odette) and the black swan (Odile), the same ballet dancer performs the white Swan and the black-clad young von Rothbart in this version. The Prince sees something of his beloved Swan in the son, and he is very attracted to his bravado and animal magnetism but shocked by his lewdness, especially towards his mother. During bump and grind group numbers and a sequence of national dances, it becomes clear that the Queen is powerfully attracted to von Rothbart's son. His father, the Private Secretary, looks on with an increasingly triumphant approval. The Prince also tries to approach young von Rothbart, only to be rebuffed. The Prince retreats into his mind and imagines dancing intimately with him, but the Prince's confusion interrupts the fantasy, and the son's movements turn from love to violence. The Prince imagines the Queen and young von Rothbart flaunting their growing physical affection for each other. They join with the other guests at the ball to laugh and ridicule him because of his growing distress. The Queen and young von Rothbart end their dancing with an embrace and passionate kissing. The Prince, in his fury, violently separates them and is rewarded by outrage from both and a slap from his mother. Overwhelmed by conflicted feelings, the Prince produces a pistol and threatens to shoot his mother. In an ensuing scuffle the Girlfriend tries to dissuade the Prince, while the Private Secretary draws a pistol and points it at the Prince. As shots ring out, the Girlfriend and the Prince fall to the ground, but only the Girlfriend has been hit. She lies unconscious and the Prince is dragged away, while the Queen throws herself into young von Rothbart's arms. He gives the pistol he had taken from the Prince to his father, the two of them laughing. The plot has evolved over the 15 years since the debut. The most conspicuous change Bourne made was to remove the subplot of the von Rothbart conspiracy to put his son on the throne. The Private Secretary now becomes just a functionary (no longer a von Rothbart counterpart, nor villain) and the Stranger is no longer shown conspiring with him. The identity of the Stranger becomes even more vague and Bourne prefers to leave him and his relationship with the Prince up to the individual interpretation of the viewer. = Act IV = In the final act, the Prince, regarded as having lost his mind, is confined to an asylum in a room with a high barred window, and is treated by a doctor and a team of nurses wearing masks that resemble the Queen's face, in a scene reminiscent of his dressing at the beginning of the ballet. The Queen visits but, again, she is still unable to fully express love for her son. The Prince crawls into bed and appears to sleep. However, he begins writhing as he dreams of the troupe of swans emerging from under and behind, dancing around him. He wakes from his nightmare, checking under his bed and around his room for swans. His tortured expression and jerky movements convey the Prince in turmoil. His lead Swan then slowly emerges from within the Prince's bed. The Swan dances with the Prince and assures him of his continued affection. But, the rest of the swans turn on the lead Swan when he makes it clear that he values his relationship with the Prince more than he does them. They separate the two and begin attacking the Prince before the Swan leaps in to save him. The Swan embraces the Prince and envelops him in his wings. The swans' fury increases and their next attack dismembers the Swan, who then disappears. Heartbroken and despondent, the Prince wails and collapses onto the bed. The Queen then finds her dead son's body and breaks down in sobs. However, in death the Prince and the Swan are reunited, as shown by a tableau depicting the lead Swan tenderly holding the young Prince in his arms.  Imagery and innovation  The original Swan Lake was based on the story of Ondine, a German myth with a theme common in Romanticism that was adapted by Hans Christian Andersen for his story The Little Mermaid. Ondine was a beautiful and immortal water nymph. The only threat to her eternal happiness was if she fell in love with a mortal and bore his child, as she would then lose her immortality. Ondine duly fell in love with a dashing knight, Sir Lawrence, and they were married, the knight pledging unfailing love and faithfulness to her with his every waking breath. A year after their wedding Ondine bore Lawrence a son. From that moment she began to age. As Ondine's beauty faded, Lawrence lost interest in her. One afternoon Ondine was walking near some stables when she heard the familiar snoring of her husband. When she entered the stable, she saw Sir Lawrence lying in the arms of another woman. Kicking her husband awake, she cursed him such that he would have breath so long as he remained awake, but if he ever fell asleep his breath would be taken from him and he would die. According to Alastair Macaulay (formerly chief dance critic of The New York Times, The Times Literary Supplement and chief theatre critic of the Financial Times), the Ondine myth is said to be an image of psycho-sexual distress: the nymph is a forlorn image of repressed virginity, anxious that she will never achieve womanly fulfillment, while her feminine nemesis that leads her husband astray represents the confident seductive power that threatens her hopes. The story is double-edged: the human protagonist, in loving the nymph, transgresses against his own kind and may be punished. If, having betrayed her once, he returns to her, her kiss will bring him death; in fact, it may be this love- in-death that the man desires most.Alastair Macaulay, \\"Swan Lake: The Matthew Bourne version\\", from the programme from Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake, above. Bourne's Swan Lake radically reinterprets the myth. The focus of the ballet is turned away from the Ondine character to the man ‚Äì the Prince. It is the Prince who struggles against repression and hopes for liberty, and who needs love to make him safe. In addition, it is not the mortal who is unfaithful to the nymph. Rather, it is the Swan who (in Act Two) expresses love for the Prince, betrays him in the form of the Stranger (Act Three), and finally returns to him (Act Four). However, as in the Ondine myth, the sin of betrayal cannot be expiated except in death.  Politics  Much has been made of Bourne's decision to cast men as the swans. The original ballet is a standard in the European tradition of romanticized female‚Äìmale love. The heroine, the swan princess Odette, is portrayed as powerless but lovely in accordance with conventional gender roles, and her hero is portrayed as a hunter who alone has the power to save her. Having a man in the role of lead Swan suggests that the Prince's struggle has repressed gay love at its core, and changes the realm of the plot from magical to psychological. The fierce, bird-like choreography given to the swan corps re-interprets the archetype of the swan as a pretty, feminine bird of gentle grace. According to Bourne, \\"The idea of a male swan makes complete sense to me. The strength, the beauty, the enormous wingspan of these creatures suggests to the musculature of a male dancer more readily than a ballerina in her white tutu.\\" However, the same central themes carry through both works. Both are about doomed, forbidden love, and both feature a Prince who wishes to transcend the boundaries of everyday convention through that love. Both themes have strong ties to the life of Tchaikovsky, the ballet's composer, whose homosexuality caused a number of complications in his life.  The score  In order to accommodate his revised scenario, Bourne somewhat altered Tchaikovsky's score, reordering several numbers and omitting others. For example, No. 5 has been moved in its entirety from Act One to Act Three, where it follows the (reordered) national dances. Act Three has been trimmed by leaving out most of No. 19 and all of the following pas de deux.

He was an evangelist of the Middle Angles and East Saxons in England and a significant participant in the Synod of Whitby, a meeting which resolved important differences within the Church in England. He is venerated in the Catholic Church, Anglicanism, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Background The little that is known about Cedd comes to us mainly from the writing of Bede in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People. The following account is based entirely on Book 3 of Bede's History. Cedd was born in the kingdom of Northumbria and brought up on the island of Lindisfarne by Aidan of the Irish Church. He had three brothers: Chad of Mercia (transcribed into Bede's Latin text as Ceadda), Cynibil and C√¶lin). All four were priests and both Cedd and Chad became bishops. The first datable reference to Cedd by Bede makes clear that he was a priest by the year 653. This probably pushes his birth date back to the early 620s. It is likely that Cedd was oldest of the brothers and was acknowledged the head of the family. He seems to have taken the lead, while Chad was his chosen successor. Aidan had come to Northumbria from Iona, bringing with him a set of practices that are known as the Celtic Rite. As well as superficial differences over the Computus (calculation of the date of Easter), and the cut of the tonsure, these involved a pattern of Church organization fundamentally different from the diocesan structure that was evolving on the continent of Europe. Activity was based in monasteries, which supported peripatetic missionary bishops. There was a strong emphasis on personal asceticism, on Biblical exegesis, and on eschatology. Aidan was well known for his personal austerity and disregard for the trappings of wealth and power. Bede several times stresses that Cedd and Chad absorbed his example and traditions. Bede tells us that Chad and many other Northumbrians went to study with the Irish after the death of Aidan (651). Cedd is not mentioned as one of the wandering scholars. He is portrayed by Bede as very close to Aidan's successor, Finan. So it is highly likely that he owed his entire formation as a priest and scholar to Aidan and to Lindisfarne. Mission to Mercia In 653, Cedd was sent by Oswiu of Northumberland with three other priests to evangelise the Middle Angles, who were one of the core ethnic groups of Mercia, based on the mid-Trent Valley. Peada of Mercia, son of Penda, was sub-king of the Middle Angles. Peada had agreed to become a Christian in return for the hand of Oswiu's daughter, Alchflaed (c.635-c.714) in marriage. This was a time of growing Northumbrian power, as Oswiu reunited and consolidated the Northumbrian kingdom after its earlier (641/2) defeat by Penda. Peada travelled to Northumbria to negotiate his marriage and baptism. Cedd, together with the priests, Adda, Betti and Diuma, accompanied Peada back to Middle Anglia, where they won numerous converts of all classes. Bede relates that the pagan Penda did not obstruct preaching even among his subjects in Mercia proper, and portrays him as generally sympathetic to Christianity at this point ‚Äì a very different view from the general estimate of Penda as a devoted pagan. But, the mission apparently made little headway in the wider Mercian polity. Bede credits Cedd's brother Chad with the effective evangelization of Mercia more than a decade later. To make progress among the general population, Christianity appeared to need positive royal backing, including grants of land for monasteries, rather than a benign attitude from leaders. Bishop of the East Saxons Cedd was soon recalled from the mission to Mercia by Oswiu, who sent him on a mission with one other priest to the East Saxon kingdom. The priests had been requested by Sigeberht the Good to reconvert his people. The East Saxon kingdom was originally converted by missionaries from Canterbury, where Augustine of Canterbury had established a Roman mission in 597. The first bishop of the Roman Rite was Mellitus, who arrived in Essex in 604. After a decade, he was driven out of the area. The religious destiny of the kingdom was constantly in the balance, with the royal family itself divided among Christians, pagans, and some wanting to tolerate both. Bede tells us that Sigeberht's decision to be baptized and to reconvert his kingdom was at the initiative of Oswiu. Sigeberht travelled to Northumbria to accept baptism from Bishop Finan of Lindisfarne. Cedd went to the East Saxons partly as an emissary of the Northumbrian monarchy. Certainly his prospects were helped by the continuing military and political success of Northumbria, especially the final defeat of Penda in 655. Practically, Northumbria gained hegemony among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. After making some conversions, Cedd returned to Lindisfarne to report to Finan. In recognition of his success, Finan ordained him bishop, calling in two other Irish bishops to assist at the rite. Cedd was appointed bishop of the East Saxons. As a result, he is generally listed among the bishops of London, a part of the East Saxon kingdom. Bede, however, generally uses ethnic descriptions for episcopal responsibilities when dealing with the generation of Cedd and Chad. Bede's record makes clear that Cedd demanded personal commitment and that he was unafraid to confront the powerful. He excommunicated a thegn who was in an unlawful marriage and forbade Christians to accept the man's hospitality. According to Bede, when Sigeberht continued to visit the man's home, Cedd went to the house to denounce the king, foretelling that he would die in that house. Bede asserts that the King's subsequent murder (660) was his penance for defying Cedd's injunction. After the death of Sigeberht, there were signs that Cedd had a more precarious position. The new king, Swithhelm of Essex, who had assassinated Sigeberht, was a pagan. He had long been a client of √Üthelwold of East Anglia, who was increasingly dependent on Wulfhere of Mercia, the Christian king of a newly resurgent Mercia. After some persuasion from Ethelwald, Swithelm accepted baptism from Cedd. The bishop traveled into East Anglia to baptize the king at Ethelwald's home. For a time, the East Saxon kingdom remained Christian. Bede presents Cedd's work as decisive in the conversion of the East Saxons, although it was preceded by other missionaries, and eventually followed by a revival of paganism. Despite the substantial work, the future suggested that all could be undone. Monastic foundations Cedd founded many churches. He also founded monasteries at Tilaburg (probably East Tilbury, but possibly West Tilbury) and Ithancester (almost certainly Bradwell-on-Sea). Cedd was appointed as abbot of the monastery of Lastingham in his native Northumbria at the request of the sub-king ≈íthelwald of Deira. Bede records the foundation of this monastery in some detail, showing that Ethelwald was put in contact with Cedd through Caelin, one of the bishop's brothers, who was on the king's staff. Cedd undertook a 40-day fast to purify the site, although urgent royal business took him away after 30 days, and Cynibil took over the fast for him. Cedd occupied the position of abbot of Lastingham to the end of his life, while maintaining his position as missionary bishop and diplomat. He often traveled far from the monastery in fulfillment of these other duties. His brother Chad, who succeeded him as abbot, did the same. Cedd and his brothers regarded Lastingham as a monastic base, providing intellectual and spiritual support, and a place of retreat. Cedd delegated daily care of Lastingham to other priests, and it is likely that Chad operated similarly. Final years Cedd had been brought up in the Celtic Rite, which differed from the Roman Rite in the dating of the religious calendar and other practices, including the tonsure of monks. Supporters of each rite met at a council within the Northumbrian kingdom known as the Synod of Whitby. The proceedings of the council were hampered by the participants' mutual incomprehension of each other's languages, which probably included Old Irish, Old English, Frankish and Old Welsh, as well as Latin. Bede recounted that Cedd interpreted for both sides. Cedd's facility with the languages, together with his status as a trusted royal emissary, likely made him a key figure in the negotiations. His skills were seen as an eschatological sign of the presence of the Holy Spirit, in contrast to the Biblical account of the Tower of Babel.Mayr-Harting (1991), The Coming of Christianity, p. 9. When the council ended, Cedd returned to Essex. According to Bede, Cedd accepted the Roman dating of the observance of Easter. He returned to his work as bishop, abandoning the practices of the Irish of D√°l Riata. A short time later, he returned to Northumbria and the monastery at Lastingham. He fell ill with the plague and died on 26 October 664.Powicke Handbook of British Chronology p. 238 Bede records that immediately after Cedd's death a party of thirty monks travelled up from Essex to Lastingham to do homage.Robinson, C.H.R. The Conversion of Europe. London: Longmans, Green, and Co. 1917, p.148 All but one small boy died there, also of the plague. Cedd was initially buried at Lastingham in a grave. Later, when a stone church was built, his body was moved and re-interred in a shrine inside the church of the monastery. Chad succeeded his brother as abbot at Lastingham. King Swithhelm of Essex died at about the same time as Cedd. He was succeeded by the joint kings Sighere and S√¶bbi. Some people reverted to paganism, which Bede said was due to the effects of the plague. Mercia under King Wulfhere was the dominant force south of the Humber, so it fell to Wulfhere to take prompt action. He dispatched Bishop Jaruman to take over Cedd's work among the East Saxons. Jaruman, working (according to Bede) with great discretion, toured Essex, negotiated with local magnates, and soon restored Christianity.

A. M. Rodger, \\"Naval Records for Genealogists\\" pp 13,14 Mark John Currie RN (later Vice-Admiral) played a significant role in the exploration of Australia and the foundation of the Swan River Colony, later named Western Australia. He explored areas in New South Wales, after which he returned to a post in England. In 1829 he married and left three weeks later for Australia on the 443-ton with his wife and servants, arriving at the coast of what was to become the Swan River settlement on .

The diaries and paintings by his wife, Jane Eliza Currie, provide a glimpse into the hard life of the first settlers.diary copies donated by grandson Mark Macrae are in the State Library of West Australia Her painting Panorama of the Swan River Settlement shows Fremantle in 1831. From it one can begin to appreciate the magnitude of the challenge faced by the colonists. Family background Mark John was born on 21 June 1795, the second of eight children of Mark Currie, Esq. of Upper Gatton, Surrey, and Elizabeth (n√©e Close)Burke's Peerage & Baronetage, section Currie and he was educated at Charterhouse School. A portrait by Romney of his mother, entitled Mrs Mark Currie 1789,Tate Gallery, portrait by George Romney of Mrs Mark Currie 1789 is in the Tate Gallery, London. His younger brother, Frederick was created 1st Baronet in 1847 for his services to the Government of India in negotiating the treaties of Lahore and Bhyrowal. The family descended from the ancient Scots Corrie family of Annandale and the Western Isles, through Cuthbert Currie, a cadet living in Duns in the 16th century.Duns Parish Records It is not related to the Clan Currie created in the 18th century from a sept of the ancient Scots MacMhuirrich Clan. Mark John married Jane Eliza n√©e Wood on 14 January 1829. They had six children. The first two, Jane Eliza (17 January 1830) and Mark Riddell (17 August 1831) were born in the Swan River Colony. Charlotte (1833), Henrietta Blackwood (1834), Albert Purcell (12 September 1837) and Algernon (1840) were born in England. Career =Early days= He entered the Royal Navy as a Volunteer, First-Class, at age 12 on , and was posted to under Captain Blackwood (later Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Blackwood). There he met James Stirling and the two became close and lifelong friends.Pamela Statham-Drew 2003 \\"James Stirling, Admiral and Founding Governor of Western Australia\\" UWA Press He was promoted to Lieutenant on 23 September 1813 and served on (1814/15), (1816/17), (1818), (1820), (1821) and (1821/22).National Archives ADM 196/3 page 570, drawer 6 He was promoted to Commander on 9 July 1823. In 1822 and 1823, as commander of , he carried out surveys of channels and port entries on the coast of New South Wales and in 1822 commented critically on the penal colony at Newcastle, reporting \\"King Lash is master here\\". He was probably not referring directly to the Commandant of the colony, James Thomas Morisset, but to the number and harshness of the punishments he saw at the time of his visit. Starting in May 1823, Currie, together with Brigade Major John OvensAustralian Dictionary of Biography, John Ovens and experienced bushman Joseph Wild explored the country east and south-west of Lake George in New South Wales. After crossing several rivers and the Goulburn plains they arrived at the east bank of the lake, at about north of the southern end. They struck south-south-east and then west across the Limestone Plains through an area ideal for settlement (now Canberra) to an area which Currie named Isabella's Plain after Isabella Brisbane, the infant daughter of the Governor, Sir Thomas Brisbane. Today this is a suburb in the Tuggeranong district of Canberra. They came to the Murrumbidgee River and followed it in a southerly direction, crossing the Umaralla River thinking it to be the Murrumbidgee. There they came to fertile plains which they named Brisbane Downs. Today the aboriginal name Monaro has been restored to the region.The Discovery of Manaro It is likely that the fertility of these areas of New South Wales led him to underestimate the problems that would later be faced in the Swan River Settlement. When he was a midshipman he must have given a good account of himself because, when in 1827 Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Blackwood became Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, he appointed Currie as his Secretary.Explorers' Diaries of Western Australia The Nore was a naval station at the mouth of the River Thames and for several hundred years one of the most important commands for the defence of the United Kingdom. =The Swan River Settlement= During most of the second half of 1828 Stirling was in London, vigorously promoting his dream of leading a settlement at the Swan River. Initial Government reaction was unfavourable, but his persistence and enthusiasm paid off and by November the scheme had support from Sir George Murray, Secretary for War and the Colonies, and had gained an unstoppable momentum. By this time the team of administrators had been decided and on 31 December 1828, Under Secretary Robert W HayUnder Secretary to the Secretary for War and the Colonies, Sir George Murray formally appointed Currie as Harbour Master for the new settlement, on no salary. Currie promptly married and on Sunday, 8 February 1829, he and his wife and their servants were on their way on board the . During the voyage Stirling started to make arrangements for the administration of the settlement. He formed \\"A Board of Counsel and Audit in the management of the property of the Crown and of public property within the Settlement\\" and on 16 May the Colonial Secretary, Peter Brown issued an instruction appointing Currie, Roe and the Registrar, William Stirling, to act as Commissioners of the Board. The document ended: \\"The duties of this office created by the appointment will be fully made known to you hereafter by the Instructions and References which you will occasionally receive. In the meantime I am to acquaint you that his Excellency expects from your zeal the performance of the service required of you without reward of remuneration beyond the satisfaction you will derive from the fulfilment of a duty of this confidential nature.\\" On 31 May the passengers had their first sight of the western coast of Australia and that night the Parmelia anchored off the west coast of Garden Island. The following day the plan was to anchor in Cockburn Sound, between Garden Island and the mainland, but a heavy swell prevented this and instead they anchored off Rottnest Island. On 2 June they made another attempt but, in Stirling's words \\"The Parmelia under my over-confident pilotage took the ground\\". The next day Captain Charles Fremantle, who had been sent ahead in to claim the colony for King George IV, and the combined efforts of the crews of both ships \\"extricated her from her perilous situation after she had received much damage\\". The need to repair the damage made it necessary for the livestock and the passengers and their property to be unloaded and landed on Garden Island. Jane Currie's diary records \\"July 8, 1829 - Left the Parmelia. Dined at the Governor's. Slept under His Majesty's canvas, within our own walls\\". She lists their \\"stock, brought from the Cape and landed on Garden Island - Cow & calf, 4 Merinos, Sow, Goat & kid, 4 Ducks, 4 Drakes, 2 Cocks and 3 Hens - 3 couple Pigeons, 2¬Ω couple Rabbits, 3 couple Guinea fowl.\\" The families remained on Garden Island for the first few months while the menfolk explored the mainland. Soon after arrival Currie, on the Governor's pony, was declared the winner of the colony's first unofficial horse race, held on the shore of Garden Island. Currie made three expeditions south of the Swan during 1829. In July he led an exploration south of Fremantle. He was accompanied by botanist James Drummond, Dr Simmons and Lieut. George Griffin. From the coast at the present day town of Rockingham they moved inland and climbed a small hill, now named Baldivis. From the summit of this hill they could see a course of water, that Currie later referred to as the Serpentine. This name first appeared on a map published by the Royal Geographical Society in 1832.NatureBase Serpentine National Park At one time this river was mistaken for the Murray River. The first task of the administrators was to find a site for the principal town. A location on the Swan River was selected and on 12 August Helen Dance, wife of Captain William Dance of , ceremoniously cut a tree to mark the foundation of Perth. Currie was present at the ceremony and later the same day took up his duties, at a salary of 100 pounds, as the first Harbour Master of Fremantle, responsible for pilotage and services at the port. A tent was erected \\"for the despatch of business\\" on the site chosen for the town. This was to provide offices for the Colonial Secretary, the Surveyor General, the Harbour Master, the Civil Engineer and the Commissioners of the Board of Counsel and Audit. However, later that year, Currie decided it would be more convenient to make his office as Harbour Master and Postmaster on board the wreck of the Marquis of Anglesea, which had been swept ashore in a gale on 23 August 1829.Encyclopedia of Australian Shipwrecks The wreck is visible in Jane Currie's Panorama of the Swan River Settlement. Currie became the Swan River Colony's first Auditor, appointed 1 July 1831, at a salary of 300 pounds \\"because his ability, intelligence and Integrity render him far more valuable to the public in that capacity than as Harbour Master\\". He was made responsible to the Colonial Office through the Governor.O Bowyer \\"The Audit Department and its History\\" On 6 February 1832, empowered by Parliament through the Order-in-Council officially constituting the colony, a Legislative Council was formed, comprising the Governor, the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, the Surveyor-General and the Advocate-General. On his own initiative Stirling added Currie to the list as Clerk to the Council, as he \\"could not find within the colony a person better calculated than the gentleman who now fills it\\". This was high praise, but wasted, because later that year Currie wrote to Peter Brown requesting that the Governor grant him leave of absence \\"to proceed thither\\" to England because of \\"urgent private affairs\\". This was granted on 26 June and on 12 August, the third anniversary of the Foundation of Perth, Currie and his family left the colony on Sulphur, not to return. However, two of his servants, Frederick and Mildred (Kitty) Ludlow, remained. In 1834 Ludlow kept a diary of a journey from Augusta to Perth and is credited with the discovery of the Capel River.Landgate \\"History of river names - Capel\\" =Land development= Crawley Bay in the 1890s. Originally part of Currie's land grant, it was later sold to Henry Sutherland and in 1910 acquired by the state. In 1922 it was vested in the University of Western Australia. Currie was allotted a grant of land south-west of the present centre of Perth, alongside a wide point in the Swan River known then as Eliza Bay and Point Currie. The Curries left Garden Island on 2 November to set up their tent on their allotment. After Currie left the colony he sold this grant to Henry Sutherland, the Assistant Surveyor, who later changed the name to Crawley Bay after his mother's maiden name. Later still it became Matilda Bay, to honour Matilda Roe, the wife of the Surveyor General. In 1910 the site was acquired by the state and today is the campus of the University of Western Australia. Point Currie, also known as Pelican Point and J H Abraham's Reserve, is today the home of the Royal Perth Yacht Club, the Mounts Bay Sailing Club and the 1st Pelican Point Sea Scouts. A later settlement was alongside the Swan, north of east of the centre of Perth. Here, early in 1831, he built a brick homestead, near the present day Water Street, which he named Redcliff, after the steep red clay banks of the river.Landgate - History of metropolitan suburb names Today the area is part of the suburb Redcliffe.Department of Land Information, Government of Western Australia A further grant was located about north-west of Beverley at the junction of the Avon River and Dale River, adjoining a grant made to Stirling. Currie's and Stirling's grants were combined in 1849 to form the Avondale Estate, which was acquired by the state in 1910 and is now the site of the Avondale Agricultural Research Station. Jane Brook, a suburb of the town of Swan about north-east of Perth, takes its name from the brook, a tributary of the Swan River. Stirling named this Jane Brook, in Jane Currie's honour. =Later career= He was promoted to Post Captain in 1841. In January 1854, Rear Admiral Sir James Stirling was appointed Commander-in-Chief China and the East Indies Station and immediately wrote to the Admiralty applying for Currie to be his secretary. They arrived in Hong Kong on 11 May and the Admiral's flag was transferred to . Two weeks later news was received from England that war had been declared on Russia and the next day the Winchester led a small squadron northwards along the Chinese coast to make a show of strength and 'to prevent Russian ships of war and their prizes from making use of (Japanese) ports'. Stirling's letters and Currie's diaries record the patient and tactful negotiations with the Governor of Nagasaki to achieve this aim and the events leading up to Stirling signing the first Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty. He received two further promotions, to Rear Admiral on the Reserved List in 1862 and to Vice-Admiral in 1867. Vice-Admiral Mark John Currie died on 2 May 1874, in Thicket Road, Anerley, Crystal Palace, Surrey. Jane Eliza Currie survived him by two years. In the 1871 British Census she is recorded at 193 Clifton Villas, Beckenham, Kent, on a visit to her daughter Jane Eliza Macrae, who married Robert Campbell Macrae in 1854 and had eight children, the eldest of whom, Mark, later lived at Cranbrook Road, Rose Bay, New South Wales.

Located in the heritage-listed Adelaide railway station building on North Terrace, Adelaide, the casino has 90 gaming tables and 950 gaming machines, as well as several bars, function areas and restaurants. Operated as part of the Skycity Entertainment Group, it is the sole licensed casino in South Australia, regulated by the Independent Gambling Authority and the Liquor and Gambling Commissioner (Consumer and Business Services) under the Casino Act 1997. The Casino is the 10th largest employer in South Australia, currently employing over 1100 staff members. In 2007/2008, Adelaide Casino paid over $41 million in taxes and charges to the State and Federal Governments.  History  Looking towards what is now the Adelaide Casino entrance from a laneway extending from Hindley Street, 1937 The Adelaide Casino opened in December 1985, the casino licence being held by the (State-owned) Lotteries Commission which appointed Aitco Pty Ltd to establish and operate a casino on its behalf. Originally consisting of 89 gaming tables, in 1991 the casino was authorised to operate video gaming machines, and in 1993 to operate poker machines. By 1997 they totalled 674 machines. The monies received by the Commission from the Casino operator include unclaimed prizes, licence fees, 13.75% of net gaming revenue from tables, and 4.0% of turnover from machines. In the year ending June 1995 the amount paid to the Government was $20.20 million. In June 2000 the casino was sold to Skycity Entertainment Group, under a new licensing regime which eliminated the separation of roles of the licensee and the operator and provided for the grant of a single casino licence. The new licensee was Skycity Adelaide Pty Ltd and the approved licensing agreement locked in 15 years of exclusivity over casino table games which also included fixed rates of duty for the exclusivity period. The property was officially renamed Skycity Adelaide in April 2001. A three-year interior redevelopment project began in December 2003. In 2009 the name reverted to Adelaide Casino. In 2007 following widening of North Terrace to create space for two tramlines, the Balfours Pie Cart, which sold pie floaters, was removed from its location. Following licence variations formalised on 11 October 2013, Skycity Adelaide's casino licence gave Adelaide Casino a monopoly on table games and automated table game product in South Australia until 30 June 2035 (a 20-year extension of the original exclusivity), along with new duty arrangements. The Adelaide Casino competes for gaming machine (slot) business with South Australia's hotels and licensed clubs (of which about 480 are licensed to operate just over 12,400 machines). The new licence arrangements increased the property's capacity from 90 to 200 tables and from 995 to 1500 gaming machines, subject to redevelopment to provide the required floor space. As part of a major interior refurbishment in 2014, the Casino commissioned hand-crafted glass light pendants from a team of 12 artists at the JamFactory studios, which would be hung from the ceiling of the SKYroom (formerly the Pearl Room). As part of the Riverbank precinct redevelopment started in 2015 which includes the Adelaide Convention Centre and Adelaide Festival Centre, the Casino announced an expansion beginning in 2018, aiming to transform it into \\"an integrated entertainment destination on the Festival Plaza forecourt\\". On 25 March 2020, the Adelaide Casino announced it was closing down for a long time. This was because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Life Bosio was born in Malta, and was sent as a boy to the care of his uncle, who was a representative at the Holy See of the Knights of Malta. He studied literature, philosophy, and jurisprudence, but at the age of eighteen he gave up his legal studies, went to Rome and for the remainder of his lifetime was devoted to archaeological work in the Roman catacombs. He died in Rome in 1629. Work The accidental discovery in 1578 of an ancient subterranean cemetery on the Via Salaria had attracted general attention in Rome. Few, however, realized the importance of the discovery, and with the exception of three foreign scholars, Alfonso Chacon,The Andalusian scholar Chacon (c1540/42-1599) called Ciacconio in Italy), entered the Dominican order and concentrated in ecclesiastical history and Christian antiquities, producing a Lives of the popes and cardinals of the Holy Roman Church' that was published in Rome, 1601-1602 the antiquarian Philips van Winghe (1560‚Äì1592) from Leuven See on Philips van Winghe: Cornelis Schuddeboom, Philips van Winghe (1560-1592) en het ontstaan van de christelijke archeologie, Haren 1996. and Jean L'Heureux (alias Macarius),L'Heureux's notes on the catacombs of 1605 remained in manuscript until they were edited and published in the mid-nineteenth century by Raffaele Garrucci; no one seriously thought of pursuing further investigations. Bosio began the systematic exploration of subterranean Rome and thus became a precursor of the science of Christian archaeology, an inspiration to Giovanni Battista de Rossi. The young explorer realized that early Christian literature such as acta of the martyrs and accounts of the councils would offer clues to the locations of the catacombs; an idea of the vast scope of his reading is in two great folio volumes of his manuscript notes in the Vallicelliana library at Rome, each of which contains about a thousand pages. The scholarly labors of Bosio accounted for only half of his time; after he had collected all the data possible relative to the location of a catacomb on one of the great Roman roads leading from Rome, Bosio would set out for the places indicated, and cover the ground carefully in the hope of discovering a forgotten stairway offering access, or a luminarium lighting the underground galleries of a cemetery. He had the sense to question the local peasants. He would then descend to the subterranean galleries and commence his explorations. Narrow passages led from one series of galleries to another. Years could pass without any new entrances being discovered. Publication This life work of Bosio was all but unknown until the publication three years after his death of his Roma Sotterranea, opera postuma di Antonio Bosio Romano, antiquario ecclesiastico singolare de' suoi tempi. Compita, disposta, et accresciuta dal M. R. P. Giovanni Severani da S. Severino (Rome, 1632), usually referred to as Roma Sotterranea. The folio volume was brought out under the patronage of the Knights of Malta, edited by the Oratorian Severano, under the patronage of Cardinal Francesco Barberini. A Latin translation that appeared in 1651 took liberties with the text. Bosio's Roma Sotterranea is entirely devoted to a description of the cemeteries with the end of ascertaining all that was possible regarding the history of each cemetery, by what name it was known in antiquity, who its founders were, and what martyrs and illustrious Christians were interred there. Many of his conclusions have in modern times been found to be erroneous, but Bosio's method is acknowledged to have been scientific within the shortcomings of the infant science of archaeology. The engravings that accompanied the volume are of little use to the modern archaeologist. An unfortunate result of the publication was that with the locations known, the catacombs were scoured for anything that might prove of value on the market; though much information on the condition of the catacombs and their inscriptions and frescoes in the early 17th century was preserved in Bosio's volume, much also was lost. Some of the catacombs Bosio described have since been destroyed by subsequent construction. This book must have been rated highly by the English physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne, for copies in both Italian and Latin can be found in his library.

He was appointed Bishop of Worcester in 1997. The Charles Raven affair Selby had disagreed with the 1998 Lambeth agreement that bishops would not ordain homosexuals as clergy. In 2002 he was asked to affirm this by one of his own clergymen, Charles Raven, the vicar of St. John's Church, Kidderminster. Selby refused to do so, and was therefore asked not to come to the church to confirm people, since there would be no agreement as to what the faith being confirmed was. As Raven's licence was not renewable he had to leave his post, and founded a breakaway congregation, taking with him about half the members of the church he had served. The story made the national press several times.Daily Telegraph, 27 Jan 2002. Retirement Selby and John Saxbee were appointed Episcopal Patrons of the international No Anglican Covenant Coalition in July 2011. In a joint letter to the Church Times, Saxbee and Selby warned that \\"this is a time to hold fast to Anglicanism‚Äôs inherited culture of inclusion and respectful debate which is our way of dealing with difference rather than require assent to procedures and words that have already shown themselves to be divisive.\\" Since retirement Selby served for five years as President of the National Council for Independent Monitoring Boards, the Boards monitoring fairness and respect for those in custody. He retired from that post in 2013, and has since been an interim co-director of St Paul's Institute, the Cathedral's agency that dialogues with the financial sector in the City of London.

It has been identified as the city of Etzina, which appears in The Travels of Marco Polo. The present banner Ejin Banner is named after this city. Name Khara-Khoto is known by many names, including Hƒìich√©ng \\"black city\\", Tangut: /*zj…®Ã±r¬≤-njaÃ±¬π/ \\"black water\\" (transcribed into Chinese as ‰∫¶ÈõÜ‰πÉ Yijinai), Modern Mongolian Khar khot (Middle Mongol language: Khara Khoto, \\"black city\\") and to Chinese as Heishui City ( Hƒìishu«êch√©ng, \\"black water city\\"). History The city was founded in 1032 and became a thriving center of Western Xia trade in the 11th century. There are remains of -high ramparts and -thick outer walls. The outer walls ran for some east-west by north-south. The walled fortress was first taken by Genghis Khan in 1226, but‚Äîcontrary to a widely circulated misunderstanding‚Äîthe city continued to flourish under Mongol overlordship. During Kublai Khan's time, the city was expanded, reaching a size three times bigger than during the Tangut Empire. Toghon Tem√ºr concentrated his preparation for the reconquest of China at Khara-Khoto. The city was located on the crossroads connecting Karakorum, Shangdu and Kumul. In The Travels of Marco Polo, Marco Polo describes a visit to a city called Etzina or Edzina, which has been identified with Khara-Khoto.The Travels of Marco Polo, by Marco Polo , translated by Henry Yule. Book 1, Chapter 45. Image from Aurel Stein's visit. A tomb (possibly a mosque) at the southeast corner, viewed from the east. According to a legend of the local Torghut population, in 1372 a Mongol military general named Khara Bator () was surrounded with his troops by the armies of China's Ming dynasty. Diverting the Ejin River, the city's water source that flowed just outside the fortress, the Han Chinese denied Khara-Khoto water for its gardens and wells. As time passed and Khara Bator realised his fate, he murdered his family and then himself. After his suicide, Khara Bator's soldiers waited within the fortress until the Ming finally attacked and killed the remaining inhabitants. Another version of the legend holds that Khara Bator made a breach in the northwestern corner of the city wall and escaped through it. The remains of the city have a breach through which a rider can pass. The defeat of the Mongols at Kharakhoto is described in the Ming dynasty annals: \\"In the fifth year of Hungu (1372), General Feng Sheng and his army reached Edzina. The town's defender Buyan'temur surrendered, and Chinese troops reached the mountains of Bojiashan. The ruler of Yuan, Gyardzhipan', fled. His minister... and 27 others were captured, together with ten or more thousand head of horses and cattle.\\"Ming-Shih, Shanghai, 1935, quoted in Kira Fyodorovna Samosyuk, \\"The Discovery of Khara-khoto\\" in Lost Empire of the Silk Road ed. Mikhail Piotrovsky, Milano: Electra, 1999, p.45 After the defeat, and also possibly due to real water shortage, the city was abandoned and left in ruins. Its exceedingly remote location preserved it from looters. Exploration Plan of Khara-Khoto, Aurel Stein expedition Russian explorers Grigory Potanin and Vladimir Obruchev heard rumours that somewhere downstream the Ejin River an ancient city was waiting. This knowledge gave impetus to the Asian Museum, St. Petersburg, to launch a new Mongol-Sichuan expedition under the command of Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov. Kozlov expedition map However, Khara-Khoto was earlier discovered by a Buryat person called Tsokto Badmazhapov in the spring of 1907 . Badmazhapov sent photographs and a handwritten description of Khara-khoto to the Geographical Society in St Petersburg. On May 1, 1908, during his 1907‚Äì1909 expedition to Central Asia, Kozlov arrived at Khara-Khoto and, with a dinner and gift of a gramophone to a local Torghut lord Dashi Beile, obtained permission to dig at the site. Over 2,000 books, scrolls and manuscripts in the Tangut language were uncovered. Kozlov initially sent ten chests of manuscripts and Buddhist objects to St. Petersburg, returning again in May 1909 for more objects. The books and woodcuts were found in June, while excavating a stupa outside city walls some westward. Sir Aurel Stein excavated Khara-Khoto during his third Central Asian expedition from July 1913 to February 1916, surveying Khara-Khoto for eight days at the end of May 1914. The findings from this research was incorporated in chapter 13 of Stein's first volume of Innermost Asia. Langdon Warner visited Khara-Khoto in 1925. Folke Bergman first traveled to Khara-Khoto in 1927, returning in 1929 and staying for a year and a half in the area. He made maps of Khara-Khoto and the Ejin River area, surveyed watchtowers and fortresses, finding a large number of xylographs. Bergman noted that Kozlov's and Stein's visits were cursory and some of their published documentation was partially incorrect. Sven Hedin and Xu Xusheng led the Sino-Swedish Expedition on archaeological excavations of the site between 1927‚Äì31. After Hedin, John DeFrancis visited in 1935. Further Chinese excavations between 1983 and 1984 by Li Yiyou, Inner Mongolian Institute of Archaeology, have produced some 3,000 more manuscripts. In addition to books, these excavations unearthed building materials, daily items, production instruments and religious art. Satellite photos show that the site is currently being preserved. Findings A silk painting from Khara-Khoto, now located in Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg Kozlov's findings, some 3,500 paintings and other objects, are in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, while the books and xylographs are at the Institute of Oriental Studies. These fortunately survived the Siege of Leningrad and some of them were even lost until their rediscovery in 1991, forming the basis for research of the Tangut language, written in Tangut script in subsequent years. The books and manuscripts sent back to St. Petersburg by Kozlov were studied by Aleksei Ivanovich Ivanov, who identified several Tangut dictionaries, including a Chinese-Tangut glossary titled Pearl in the Palm (), compiled in 1190. In addition to written artifacts, the Khara-Khoto collection in the Hermitage Museum includes paintings on silk, mainly of Buddhist subjects in Chinese and Tibetan styles. In addition, batik-dyed silk fragments have also been found. A small mud wall painting fragment confirms use of cobalt as a pigment in the form of smalt. According to Hermitage curator Kira Samosyuk, \\"Most of the paintings in the collection date from the eleventh through thirteenth centuries, while the majority of the fragments of porcelain with cobalt decorative glazing are from the fourteenth century. No painting is of a later date than 1378‚Äì1387; no Chinese text ‚Äì later than 1371; no Tangut text ‚Äì later than 1212. So it seems that the life of the town ceased sometime around 1380.\\"Kira Fyodorovna Samosyuk, \\"The Discovery of Khara-khoto\\" in Lost Empire of the Silk Road ed. Mikhail Piotrovsky, Milano: Electra, 1999, p.45 One of the puzzles of Khara-Khoto is that there was one building just outside the castle walls. Judging by its shape, it seems to be a mosque. It seems there were Muslims among the people that were ruled by the Tangut. Due to the polytheistic belief of the local people, the Muslims built their mosques outside. Traders from India and the further west would have prayed in the mosque and found relief after their arduous journey along the Silk Road Culture, Travel Documentary narrated by Graham Webster and published by NHK in 1990 ‚Äì Episode The Dark Castle .

The Scoreboard costs RM2.36 million where the funding came from the Malaysian Federal Government. The project was supervised by the Jabatan Pembangunan Persekutuan and designed by a local Audio Visual consultant appointed by the stadium. The size of the LED scoreboard is about 6√ó11 meters and could display high resolution video. The LED component came from an LED industry leader called Nicchia and imported from Japan. It is considered the best electronic scoreboard in the country in terms of resolution. The system is also equipped with a Multi-camera video production system which consists of slow-motion unit, digital video effects and graphics system. The system has 3 HD robotic cameras installed under the roof of the stadium and 3 HD portable professional video cameras. One of the HD portable camera has a HD video transmitter system which enable the camera (Fan-Cam) to send stable live video from anywhere in the stadium back to the control room for display on the LED scoreboard.

He met one of their sheikhs, Abu Dahuk, and noted the size and strength of their horses and their fondness for tobacco.

The adult females dig tunnels in the ground for nesting, while the territorial males mark twigs and other objects with pheromones to claim the territory from competing males. As with all other sphecoid wasps, the larvae are carnivorous, forcing the inseminated females to hunt for other invertebrates (in this case bees), on which she lays her eggs, supplying the larvae with prey when they emerge. The adults consume nectar from flowers. The prevalent European species, P. triangulum, specializes in preying upon honey bees, thus making it a minor pest for beekeepers.

The main character is a fairy who was given the responsibility of ensuring the well-being of a forest and its inhabitants, the animals and plants. After a while, Oriana befriends a nefarious fish, and while contemplating her image reflected in the river, Oriana is mesmerized by the fish. Deceived by the words of this fish, Oriana ends up neglecting and abandoning the forest, with serious consequences for its denizens. Deprived of her powers as punishment for this failure, Oriana begins a journey of self- consciousness to repair the evils caused by her omission. The book is a subject on Portuguese Language teaching curricula. It has been adapted to children's theatre several times, and has inspired derived works of illustration and animation.

The abbey's endowment was provided by the Agilolfing duke Theodo of Bavaria and his successor Theodbert. The nuns, all of noble birth, held extended estates up the Salzach river in the south of the city. The convent's possessions were later augmented by Emperor Henry II, who was also Duke of Bavaria. The Benedictine rule was finally implemented under Archbishop Conrad I of Salzburg in the early 12th century. The abbey became independent of the founding house from 987. After a blaze about 1006, the abbey church was re-built with the support of Henry II; he and his consort Cunigunde of Luxembourg attended the consecration in 1009. This Romanesque building was again largely destroyed in a fire of 1423. Reconstruction took place between 1464 and 1509. In 1624 the church was enlarged by the addition of three side chapels. A refurbishment in the Baroque style took place in the 1880s. Commemorative coin The Abbey was selected as main motif for the Austrian Nonnberg Abbey commemorative coin minted on April 5, 2006. This was the first coin of the series \\"Great Abbeys of Austria\\". It shows the Benedictine convent of Nonnberg Abbey. On the hilltop in the background, Hohensalzburg Fortress and the Kajetaner church can be seen. The abbey and fortress are connected by the Reisszug, one of the world's oldest extant railways. In popular culture Through Maria Augusta Kutschera, later Maria Augusta von Trapp, who became a postulant in the abbey in 1924 and whose life was the basis for the Broadway musical (1959) and film (1965) The Sound of Music, the abbey has acquired international fame. The Mother Abbess during Maria's time at Nonnberg was Sister Virgilia L√ºtz (1869-1949). Nonnberg Abbey is featured in movies depicting the life of Maria Augusta Kutschera, namely The Sound of Music and Die Trapp-Familie.

He joined the church in 1859, at the age of 19, and rose through the ministry to a position of prominence on the General Conference, a committee of Seventh-day Adventist Church leaders. Early life Dudley Marvin Canright was born in a farmhouse near Kinderhook, Michigan, on September 22, 1840, to Hiram and Loretta Canright. In 1859, at the age of 19, Dudley journeyed eastwards to attend the Albion Academy, in Albion, New York. To support himself, he worked as a farmhand for Elder Roswell F. Cottrell, a Seventh-day Adventist minister. In the summer of 1859, he attended a camp meeting, held by Elder James White, near Albion. There, he accepted the doctrine of the Advent Message, and was soon baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Dudley briefly served as secretary to Elder White, who encouraged him to enter the ministry. For 5 years, after converting his entire family to Adventism, Dudley served as an evangelist for the Seventh-day Adventist Church, traveling and preaching across the midwestern U.S. In 1865, at the age of 24, Dudley Canright was ordained by James White and J. N. Loughborough, in a service held at Battle Creek. Dudley continued his evangelistic career, preaching throughout New England. In 1867, he married Lucretia Cranson, a 19-year-old orphan, partially brought up by Ellen G. White. Mr. and Mrs. Canright had 3 children, 2 of whom survived infancy. The life of a traveling minister's wife was harsh for Mrs. Canright, and in 1879, she succumbed to tuberculosis. Two years later, Dudley was remarried, to a Miss Lucy Hadden. Their union produced 4 children, 3 of whom survived infancy. Estrangement and reconciliation with the Adventist Church For 20 years, Canright was a minister and evangelist for the Seventh-day Adventist Church across the United States. He was also a notable contributor to the Adventist periodical, the Review and Herald (now the Adventist Review). During a vacation in Colorado with James and Ellen White in 1873, Canright and his wife had a falling out with them. Canright and James White reconciled later that year. At the 1876 General Conference Session he was 1 of 3 men elected to the General Conference Executive Committee, the most prestigious committee in the denomination. In 1878, Canright was elected President of the Sabbath School Association of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. His first wife Lucretia died the following year. Canright was frequently called upon by Elder James White, and other leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, to debate ministers of other denominations, generally on the question of the seventh-day Sabbath: From the early 1880s, Canright gradually became disillusioned with what he considered autocratic behavior on the parts of Elder and Mrs. White. In 1880, he retired briefly from the ministry and journeyed through the Midwest, as an elocution teacher and lecturer. After a year of itinerant living, he returned to Battle Creek, Michigan, where he reconciled himself with Elder and Mrs. White. In a September 13, 1881 article in the Advent Review and Herald, entitled, \\"Danger of Giving Way to Discouragement and Doubts\\", Canright wrote: Break with Seventh-day Adventism In 1881, back as a Seventh-day Adventist minister, Canright remarried, and continued his life as a traveling evangelist for another year. Then, in 1882, he retired from the ministry and bought a farm in Otsego, Michigan. Once again, he began to have doubts about the White family, particularly about Ellen White's \\"gift of prophecy\\". He wavered repeatedly, several times emerging from his early retirement to hold meetings and preach. Throughout the early 1880s, his relations with Mrs. White remained amicable. Then, quite abruptly, in 1887, Canright and his wife, Lucy Canright, left the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It was a decision he had been mulling over for a year. In severing his relations with his home church, the Otsego Seventh-day Adventist Church, Canright stated the following, as recorded by the church clerk: Life after Adventism Having left the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Dudley and his family briefly considered joining the Methodist Church, but finally settled upon the Baptist Church. On March 5, 1887, he, his wife and their daughter Veva (Genevieve) were accepted into the Otsego Baptist Church. On the 17th he was given a license to preach, and 2 days later, was ordained and made the Church's salaried pastor. He remained in this position until 1889. In September 1890, Dudley and his family left Otsego, moving to Grand Rapids, Michigan. There, he became Pastor Emeritus of the Berean Baptist Church, an office he held for only a year. During his time as pastor of these churches, he occupied himself in writing his 413-page critique, Seventh-day Adventism Renounced, which was published in 1889. In 1915, he and his brother Jasper attended the funeral of Ellen G. White, during which he reportedly exclaimed, \\"There is a noble Christian woman gone!\\" In March 1916, Canright accompanied an old Adventist friend, J.H. Morrison, to a church workers' meeting in Battle Creek. Afterward, they went to Morrison's house. Following that visit, Canright walked to the local Baptist church, where he had a key to the basement. Unaware that extensive remodeling had taken place, and arriving at the church after dark, Canright fell through an open hole into the basement, broke his leg, and remained there for two days. He was taken to the local hospital, and then to the Battle Creek Sanitarium, where his leg was amputated. He spent the last 3 years of his life with his daughter Genevieve, who had converted to Christian Science. Canright died on May 12, 1919. Two months later, his final book, The Life of Mrs. E.G. White, was published. In it he criticised White heavily and maintained, among other charges:\\"Life of Mrs. E.G. White - Her Claims Refuted\\", by D.M. Canright, 1919 * that the early doctrines held in 1844 and up to 1851 failed utterly * that in some cases her prophecies were wrong, and then suppressed afterwards * that she rebuked and controlled peoples' conduct, purportedly by spiritual knowledge, but factually by informings that often attacked an innocent party * that she plagiarized many of her purportedly God-inspired texts from other authors, and had to revise one of her books at an expense of $3,000 In 1933, the Review and Herald published In Defense of the Faith: A Reply To Canright. Written by W.H. Branson, an Adventist minister, the book sought to correct what the author alleged were Canright's distortions and misrepresentations of Adventist doctrine. In 1971, the church published I Was Canright's Secretary, by Carrie Johnson, a memoir of her work for D.M. Canright in the early 1900s.

He was followed by Joseph Jordan, who opened a School of Anatomy in 1814. In the intervening 60 years more than one private medical school existed in Manchester: the most successful was the Pine Street medical school, not far south of the Infirmary. A faculty of medicine opened in 1873 (at Owens College), and medical degrees were awarded by the Victoria University from 1883. The school was made co-educational in 1899 after a long and contentious debate about whether women could be members of the College at all.Fiddes, Edward (1941) \\"Admission of Women to Full University Status\\", in: Tylecote, Mabel.

The success of the school meant that the building needed to be extended twice, in 1883 and 1894. From 1903/04 degrees were awarded by the Victoria University of Manchester. A considerable space was allocated to the library of the Manchester Medical Society (founded 1834) which until 1930 remained in their possession while accommodated in the University. The library became part of the university library at that time and remained in the building until 1981 when it was transferred into the present Main Library building of the University of Manchester Library (part of the rare books went to the John Rylands Library).Brockbank, E.

The movement is particularly associated with reform and development of the asylum system in Western Europe at that time. It fell into decline as a distinct method by the 20th century, however, due to overcrowding and misuse of asylums and the predominance of biomedical methods. The movement is widely seen as influencing certain areas of psychiatric practice up to the present day. The approach has been praised for freeing sufferers from shackles and barbaric physical treatments, instead considering such things as emotions and social interactions, but has also been criticised for blaming or oppressing individuals according to the standards of a particular social class or religion. Context Moral treatment developed in the context of the Enlightenment and its focus on social welfare and individual rights. At the start of the 18th century, the \\"insane\\" were typically viewed as wild animals who had lost their reason. They were not held morally responsible but were subject to scorn and ridicule by the public, sometimes kept in madhouses in appalling conditions, often in chains and neglected for years or subject to numerous tortuous \\"treatments\\" including whipping, beating, bloodletting, shocking, starvation, irritant chemicals, and isolation. There were some attempts to argue for more psychological understanding and therapeutic environments. For example, in England John Locke popularized the idea that there is a degree of madness in most people because emotions can cause people to incorrectly associate ideas and perceptions, and William Battie suggested a more psychological approach, but conditions generally remained poor. The treatment of King George III also led to increased optimism about the possibility of therapeutic interventions. Early development =Italy= Under the Enlightened concern of Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo in Florence, Italian physician Vincenzo Chiarugi instituted humanitarian reforms. Between 1785 and 1788 he managed to outlaw chains as a means of restraint at the Santa Dorotea hospital, building on prior attempts made there since the 1750s. From 1788 at the newly renovated St. Bonifacio Hospital he did the same, and led the development of new rules establishing a more humane regime.Mora, G. (1959) Vincenzo Chiarugi (1759‚Äì1820) and his psychiatric reform in Florence in the late 18th century (on the occasion of the bi-centenary of his birth) J Hist Med. Oct;14:424-33. =France= The ex-patient Jean-Baptiste Pussin and his wife Margueritte, and the physician Philippe Pinel (1745‚Äì1826), are also recognized as the first instigators of more humane conditions in asylums. From the early 1780s, Pussin had been in charge of the mental hospital division of the La Bic√™tre, an asylum in Paris for male patients. From the mid-1780s, Pinel was publishing articles on links between emotions, social conditions and insanity. In 1792 (formally recorded in 1793), Pinel became the chief physician at the Bicetre. Pussin showed Pinel how really knowing the patients meant they could be managed with sympathy and kindness as well as authority and control. In 1797, Pussin first freed patients of their chains and banned physical punishment, although straitjackets could be used instead. Patients were allowed to move freely about the hospital grounds, and eventually dark dungeons were replaced with sunny, well-ventilated rooms. Pussin and Pinel's approach was seen as remarkably successful and they later brought similar reforms to a mental hospital in Paris for female patients, La Salpetri√®re. Pinel's student and successor, Jean Esquirol (1772‚Äì1840), went on to help establish 10 new mental hospitals that operated on the same principles. There was an emphasis on the selection and supervision of attendants in order to establish a suitable setting to facilitate psychological work, and particularly on the employment of ex-patients as they were thought most likely to refrain from inhumane treatment while being able to stand up to pleading, menaces, or complaining. Pinel used the term \\"traitement moral\\" for the new approach. At that time \\"moral\\", in French and internationally, had a mixed meaning of either psychological/emotional (mental) or moral (ethical). Pinel distanced himself from the more religious work that was developed by the Tukes, and in fact considered that excessive religiosity could be harmful. He sometimes took a moral stance himself, however, as to what he considered to be mentally healthy and socially appropriate.Louis C Charland (2008) A moral line in the sand: Alexander Chrichton and Philippe Pinel on the psychopathology of the passions. In Fact and value in emotion By Louis C. Charland, Peter Zachar =England= An English Quaker named William Tuke (1732‚Äì1822) independently led the development of a radical new type of institution in northern England, following the death of a fellow Quaker in a local asylum in 1790. In 1796, with the help of fellow Quakers and others, he founded the York Retreat, where eventually about 30 patients lived as part of a small community in a quiet country house and engaged in a combination of rest, talk, and manual work. Rejecting medical theories and techniques, the efforts of the York Retreat centered around minimizing restraints and cultivating rationality and moral strength. The entire Tuke family became known as founders of moral treatment. They created a family-style ethos and patients performed chores to give them a sense of contribution. There was a daily routine of both work and leisure time. If patients behaved well, they were rewarded; if they behaved poorly, there was some minimal use of restraints or instilling of fear. The patients were told that treatment depended on their conduct. In this sense, the patient's moral autonomy was recognized. William Tuke's grandson, Samuel Tuke, published an influential work in the early 19th century on the methods of the retreat; Pinel's Treatise On Insanity had by then been published, and Samuel Tuke translated his term as \\"moral treatment\\". =Scotland= A very different background to the moral approach may be discerned in Scotland. Interest in mental illness was a feature of the Edinburgh medical school in the eighteenth century, with influential teachers including William Cullen (1710‚Äì1790) and Robert Whytt (1714‚Äì1766) emphasising the clinical importance of psychiatric disorders. In 1816, the phrenologist Johann Spurzheim (1776‚Äì1832) visited Edinburgh and lectured on his craniological and phrenological concepts, arousing considerable hostility, not least from the theologically doctrinaire Church of Scotland. Some of the medical students, however, notably William A.F. Browne (1805‚Äì1885), responded very positively to this materialist conception of the nervous system and, by implication, of mental disorder. George Combe (1788‚Äì1858), an Edinburgh solicitor, became an unrivalled exponent of phrenological thinking, and his brother, Andrew Combe (1797‚Äì1847), who was later appointed a physician to Queen Victoria, wrote a phrenological treatise entitled Observations on Mental Derangement (1831). George and Andrew Combe exerted a rather dictatorial authority over the Edinburgh Phrenological Society, and in the mid-1820s manipulated the de facto expulsion of the Christian phrenologists. This tradition of medical materialism found a ready partner in the Lamarckian biology purveyed by the naturalist Robert Edmond Grant (1793‚Äì1874) who exercised a striking influence on the young Charles Darwin during his time as a medical student in Edinburgh in 1826/1827. William Browne advanced his own versions of evolutionary phrenology at influential meetings of the Edinburgh Phrenological Society, the Royal Medical Society and the Plinian Society. Later, as superintendent of Sunnyside Royal Hospital (the Montrose Asylum) from 1834 to 1838, and, more extravagantly, at the Crichton Royal in Dumfries from 1838 to 1859, Browne implemented his general approach of moral management, indicating a clinical sensitivity to the social groupings, shifting symptom patterns, dreams and art-works of the patients in his care. Browne summarised his moral approach to asylum management in his book (actually the transcripts of five public lectures) which he entitled What Asylums Were, Are, and Ought To Be. His achievements with this style of psychiatric practice were rewarded with his appointment as a Commissioner in Lunacy for Scotland, and by his election to the Presidency of the Medico- Psychological Association in 1866. Browne's eldest surviving son, James Crichton-Browne (1840‚Äì1938), did much to extend his father's work in psychiatry, and, on 29 February 1924, he delivered a remarkable lecture The Story of the Brain, in which he recorded a generous appreciation of the role of the phrenologists in the early foundations of psychiatric thought and practice. =United States= A key figure in the early spread of moral treatment in the United States was Benjamin Rush (1745‚Äì1813),Ackerson, BJ. & Korr, WS. (2007) Mental Health Policy and Social Justice in [ Advancing social justice through clinical practice Etiony Aldarondo an eminent physician at Pennsylvania Hospital. He limited his practice to mental illness and developed innovative, humane approaches to treatment. He required that the hospital hire intelligent and sensitive attendants to work closely with patients, reading and talking to them and taking them on regular walks. He also suggested that it would be therapeutic for doctors to give small gifts to their patients every so often. However, Rush's treatment methods included bloodletting (bleeding), purging, hot and cold baths, mercury, and strapping patients to spinning boards and \\"tranquilizer\\" chairs.Benjamin Rush, M.D. (1749‚Äì1813): ‚ÄúThe Father of American Psychiatry‚Äù A Boston schoolteacher, Dorothea Dix (1802‚Äì1887), also helped make humane care a public and a political concern in the US. On a restorative trip to England for a year, she met Samuel Tuke. In 1841 she visited a local prison to teach Sunday school and was shocked at the conditions for the inmates and the treatment of those with mental illnesses. She began to investigate and crusaded on the issue in Massachusetts and all over the country. She supported the moral treatment model of care. She spoke to many state legislatures about the horrible sights she had witnessed at the prisons and called for reform. Dix fought for new laws and greater government funding to improve the treatment of people with mental disorders from 1841 until 1881, and personally helped establish 32 state hospitals that were to offer moral treatment. Many asylums were built according to the so-called Kirkbride Plan. Consequences The moral treatment movement was initially opposed by those in the mental health profession. By the mid-19th century, however, many psychologists had adopted the strategy. They became advocates of moral treatment, but argued that since the mentally ill often had separate physical/organic problems, medical approaches were also necessary. Making this argument stick has been described as an important step in the profession's eventual success at securing a monopoly on the treatment of \\"lunacy\\". The moral treatment movement had a huge influence on asylum construction and practice. Many countries were introducing legislation requiring local authorities to provide asylums for the local population, and they were increasingly designed and run along moral treatment lines. Additional \\"non- restraint movements\\" also developed. There was great belief in the curability of mental disorders, particularly in the US, and statistics were reported showing high recovery rates. They were later much criticized, particularly for not differentiating between new admissions and re-admissions (i.e. those who hadn't really achieved a sustained recovery). It has been noted, however, that the cure statistics showed a decline from the 1830s onwards, particularly sharply in the second half of the century, which has been linked to the dream of small, curative asylums giving way to large, centralized, overcrowded asylums.Martin Terre Blanche (1999) Readmission and the social construction of mental disturbance Chapter 2: An archaeology of psychiatric readmission. University of South Africa There was also criticism from some ex-patients and their allies. By the mid-19th century in England, the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society was proclaiming that the new moral treatment was a form of social repression achieved \\"by mildness and coaxing, and by solitary confinement\\"; that its implication that the \\"alleged lunatics\\" needed re-educating meant it treated them as if they were children incapable of making their own decisions; and that it failed to properly inform people of their rights or involve them in discussion about their treatment. The Society was suspicious of the tranquility of the asylums, suggesting that patients were simply being crushed and then discharged to live a \\"milk sop\\" (meek) existence in society. In the context of industrialization, public asylums expanded in size and number. Bound up in this was the development of the profession of psychiatry, able to expand with large numbers of inmates collected together. By the end of the 19th century and into the 20th, these large out-of-town asylums had become overcrowded, misused, isolated and run-down. The therapeutic principles had often been neglected along with the patients. Moral management techniques had turned into mindless institutional routines within an authoritarian structure. Consideration of costs quickly overrode ideals. There was compromise over decoration‚Äîno longer a homey, family atmosphere but drab and minimalist. There was an emphasis on security, custody, high walls, closed doors, shutting people off from society, and physical restraint was often used. It is well documented that there was very little therapeutic activity, and medics were little more than administrators who seldom attended to patients and mainly then for other, somatic, problems. Any hope of moral treatment or a family atmosphere was \\"obliterated\\". In 1827 the average number of asylum inmates in Britain was 166; by 1930 it was 1221. The relative proportion of the public officially diagnosed as insane grew. Although the Retreat had been based on a non-medical approach and environment, medically based reformers emulating it spoke of \\"patients\\" and \\"hospitals\\". Asylum \\"nurses\\" and attendants, once valued as a core part of providing good holistic care, were often scapegoated for the failures of the system. Towards the end of the 19th century, somatic theories, pessimism in prognosis, and custodialism had returned. Theories of hereditary degeneracy and eugenics took over, and in the 20th century the concepts of mental hygiene and mental health developed. From the mid 20th century, however, a process of antipsychiatry and deinstitutionalization occurred in many countries in the West, and asylums in many areas were gradually replaced with more local community mental health services. In the 1960s, Michel Foucault renewed the argument that moral treatment had really been a new form of moral oppression, replacing physical oppression, and his arguments were widely adopted within the antipsychiatry movement. Foucault was interested in ideas of \\"the other\\" and how society defines normalcy by defining the abnormal and its relationship to the normal. A patient in the asylum had to go through four moral syntheses: silence, recognition in the mirror, perpetual judgment, and the apotheosis of the medical personage. The mad were ignored and verbally isolated. They were made to see madness in others and then in themselves until they felt guilt and remorse. The doctor, despite his lack of medical knowledge about the underlying processes, had all powers of authority and defined insanity. Thus Foucault argues that the \\"moral\\" asylum is \\"not a free realm of observation, diagnosis, and therapeutics; it is a juridical space where one is accused, judged, and condemned.\\"Foucault, Michel. Madness and Civilization, p. 158 Foucault's reassessment was succeeded by a more balanced view, recognizing that the manipulation and ambiguous \\"kindness\\" of Tuke and Pinel may have been preferable to the harsh coercion and physical \\"treatments\\" of previous generations, while aware of moral treatment's less benevolent aspects and its potential to deteriorate into repression.Scull, A. (1989) Social Order/Mental Disorder: Anglo-American Psychiatry in Historical Perspective Chapter Four: Moral Treatment Reconsidered. Berkeley: University of California Press The moral treatment movement is widely seen as influencing psychiatric practice up to the present day, including specifically therapeutic communities (although they were intended to be less repressive); occupational therapy and Soteria houses. The Recovery model is said to have echoes of the concept of moral treatment.Shepherd, G., Boardman, J., Slade, M. (2008) Making Recovery a Reality.

Burridge 2007 pages 142-145Holy people of the world: a cross- cultural encyclopedia, Volume 3 by Phyllis G. Jestice 2004 pages 393-394 In Eastern Christianity, the term Life in Christ is sometimes used for the same concept. The ideal of the Imitation of Christ has been an important element of both Christian ethics and spirituality.The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology by Alan Richardson, John Bowden 1983 pages 285-286 References to this concept and its practice are found in the earliest Christian documents, e.g. the Pauline Epistles. Saint Augustine viewed the imitation of Christ as the fundamental purpose of Christian life, and as a remedy for the imitation of the sins of Adam.Augustine's early theology of the church by David C. Alexander 2008 page 218Augustine by Mary T. Clark 2005 page 48 Saint Francis of Assisi believed in the physical as well as the spiritual imitation of Christ, and advocated a path of poverty and preaching like Jesus who was poor at birth in the manger and died naked on the cross. Thomas √† Kempis, on the other hand, presented a path to The Imitation of Christ based on a focus on the interior life and withdrawal from the world.An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies by Orlando O. Esp√≠n, James B. Nickoloff 2007 page 609 The theme of imitation of Christ existed in all phases of Byzantine theology, and in the 14th-century book Life in Christ Nicholas Cabasilas viewed \\"living one's own personal life\\" in Christ as the fundamental Christian virtue. Early period Confessions of Augustine, Book 7 The word \\"imitate\\" does not appear in the Canonical Gospels, but the word \\"follow\\" is often applied to those who believed in Jesus, and Jesus is quoted as requiring imitation in some form (Matthew 10:38; 16:24; Luke 14:27). But in 1 Thessalonians 1:6 Apostle Paul refers to the imitation of Christ, as well as himself, and states: \\"And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit\\". Similarly, in 1 Peter 2:21, Apostle Peter explains the duty of Christians to \\"follow his [Christ's] steps\\". For Paul the imitation of Christ involves readiness to be shaped by the Holy Spirit as in Romans 8:4 and Romans 8:11, and a self-giving service of love to others as in 1 Corinthians 13 and Galatians 5:13. The imitation of Christ, as in Ephesians 5:1 is then viewed by Paul as a path to the imitation of God: \\"Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children, and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you\\". The early Church had little interest in the \\"historical Jesus\\" and this prevented an immediate development of the concept of literal imitation. Instead the earliest concepts of imitation focused on the works of the Holy Spirit, self-sacrifice and martyrdom. In time, this focus changed, and by the time of Saint Francis of Assisi attempts at literal imitation of Christ were well established. By the 4th century, the ideal of the imitation of Christ was well accepted and for Saint Augustine, it was the ultimate goal of conversion, and the fundamental purpose of Christian life.Character and Conversion in Autobiography: Augustine, Montaigne, Descartes, Rousseau, and Sartre by Patrick Riley 2004 page 43 Book 7 of the Confessions of St. Augustine includes a well known passage on \\"at least imitate the lowly God\\" that confirms the strong Christian tradition of the imitation of Christ around the year 400. Augustine viewed human beings as creatures who approach the Holy Trinity through likeness, i.e. by imitating the Son, who is bound to the Father through the grace of the Holy Spirit.The Trinity and creation in Augustine by Scott A. Dunham 2008 page 91 Thus for Augustine, the imitation of Christ is enabled by the Spirit who confers God's grace. Augustine viewed Christ as both a sign of grace and an example to be followed, and in his later writings stated that the imitation of Christ leads to a mystical union with him. Middle Ages By the end of the 9th century, the physical imitation of Christ had grown in popularity among Christians and the 895 Council of Tribur considered triple immersion in Baptism as an imitation of the three days of Jesus in the tomb, and the rising from the water as an imitation of the Resurrection of Jesus. This period also witnessed a growing trend towards the denial of the flesh in favor of the soul among the monastic communities, who saw the rebuffing of the physical body (as an imitation of the sufferings of Christ) as a path to a higher level of spiritual achievement. Francis considered his stigmata part of the physical \\"imitation of Christ\\".The Word made flesh: a history of Christian thought by Margaret Ruth Miles 2004 pages 160-161Saint Francis of Assisi by Jacques Le Goff 2003 page 44 In the 12th century, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux considered humility and love as key examples of the imitation of Christ. Bernard argued that the Father sent his Son, who in turn sent the Spirit to the Church, and that those who, in imitation of Christ, humble themselves and serve the Church will obtain intimate union with God.Bernard of Clairvaux: selected works by Saint Bernard (of Clairvaux), Gillian Rosemary Evans 1987 page Early in the 13th century, groups of mendicant friars entered the scene, aiming to imitate Christ by living a life of poverty as well as preaching, as Jesus had done, and following him to martyrdom, if necessary.Christian Brotherhoods by Frederick Deland Leete 2003 page 44 Chief among these were the followers of Saint Francis of Assisi, who believed in the physical as well as the spiritual imitation of Christ. Francis viewed poverty as a key element of the imitation of Christ who was \\"poor at birth in the manger, poor as he lived in the world, and naked as he died on the cross\\". Francis also drew attention to the poverty of the Virgin Mary, and viewed that as a noble imitation.St Francis of Assisi: The Legend and the Life by Michael Robson 2002 page 104 He was also the first reported case of stigmata in the history of Christianity, and reportedly viewed his stigmata as a key element of his imitation of Christ. Later in the 13th century, Saint Thomas Aquinas (who advocated the Perfection of Christ) considered imitation of Christ essential for a religious life. In Summa Theologi√¶ 2.2.186.5 Aquinas stated that \\"Religious perfection consists chiefly in the imitation of Christ\\" and in 3.65.2 he positioned the \\"perfection of the spiritual life\\" as an imitation of Christ, with Baptism as the first step in the path towards the imitation of a perfect Christ. The theme of imitation of Christ continued to exist in all phases of Byzantine theology, although some Eastern theologians such as Nicholas Cabasilas preferred to use the term \\"Life in Christ\\", as in his 14th-century book of the same title. Cabasilas advocated \\"living one's own personal life\\" in Christ as a fundamental Christian virtue.Holy people of the world: a cross-cultural encyclopedia, Volume 3 by Phyllis G. Jestice 2004 page 661 Cabasilas also believed that the Eucharist forms the new life in Christ.The life in Christ by Nicolaus Cabasilas 1997 page 129 In the highly influential book The Imitation of Christ first issued in 1418, Thomas √† Kempis provided specific instructions for imitating Christ. His book is perhaps the most widely read Christian devotional work after the Bible.Catholic encyclopedia: Imitation of Christ The approach taken by Kempis is characterized by its emphasis on the interior life and withdrawal from the world, as opposed to an active imitation of Christ (including outward preaching) by other friars. The book places a high level of emphasis on the devotion to the Eucharist as key element of spiritual life. Reformation The Reformation saw a multi-directional shift in focus on the concept of imitation. In the 16th century, Martin Luther initially made the connection between Baptism and imitation even stronger. But in time Luther came to dislike the term imitation, and preferred the term \\"conformation\\", seeing imitation as an attempt to conceal a doctrine on the \\"works of Christ\\". However John Calvin gave a prominent place to the imitation of Christ in his writings and worked out the ideal of a \\"mystical union\\" with Christ in a way that resonated with the New Testament. But the 16th century also witnessed a continuing interest in the imitation of Christ. Saint Ignatius of Loyola continued to advocate the path towards imitation and encouraged a sense of \\"being with Christ\\" and experiencing his humanity, e.g. in his Spiritual Exercises he asks the participant to imagine being in Calvary at the foot of the Cross, communing with Jesus on the Cross. Christian spirituality: an introduction by Alister E. McGrath 1999 pages 84-87 Christology The concept of the imitation of Christ has had a Christological context and implications from the very early days of formalized Christian theology. In the context of the Person of Christ the belief in Monophysitism, which asserted only one divine nature for Christ with no human nature ran against the ideal that humans could imitate him. Those issues were mostly resolved, however, as Monophysitism was declared heretical by the Western Church and much of the Eastern Church.Rausch, Thomas P. (2003), Who is Jesus? : an introduction to Christology, Collegeville, Minn.: Liturgical Press pages 4-7 The acceptance of a human (as well as a divine) nature for Christ by many Christians allowed the pursuit of the goal of the imitation of Christ, but with the realizations that it had inherent limits, e.g. that Christ's death in obedience to the will of the Father had a redemptive value beyond human potential.The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 pages 99-101Christology: Biblical And Historical by Mini S. Johnson, 2005 page 178 While Western Christology of the \\"imitation of Christ\\" has had a focus on the sacrifice at Calvary, that has not been the main theme in the Eastern Church where the term \\"life in Christ\\" has been used and the key focus has been the Transfiguration of Jesus.Trinitarian Christology by Michael L. Cook 2010 pages 27-29 No saints in the Eastern Church have reported signs of stigmata, but saints in the Eastern Church have frequently reported being transformed by the \\"inward light\\" of uncreated grace. A further Christological issue that differentiates the Eastern and Western approaches is that the Eastern approach sees the Father as the sole hypostatic source of the Holy Spirit. Thus in contrast to Augustine and Aquinas, Eastern Christology does not see the Holy Spirit as the bond of love between the Father and the Son and hence the imitation of the Son does not have the same implications in terms of a unity with the Father.

A courtesan is murdered and her blood spills onto the mirror on her dressing table. The second segment is set in Shanghai in 1922. Mary, an heiress to a large mansion, receives an antique dressing table as a birthday gift. She notices that there is something strange about the mirror and starts receiving eerie phone calls reminding her about her dark secrets in the past. She had an affair with a professor who already had a family. In order to silence him and take over his mansion, she poisoned him to death. One night, her two servants confront her, tell her that they are actually the professor's daughters, and avenge their father. The third segment is set in Singapore in 1988 during the Ghost Festival. James, a lawyer, has a one-night stand with Lora and tries to get away in the morning but her burly brother, Roman, stops him and forces him to marry Lora. Lora moves into James's house and brings along an antique dressing table that she inherited from her deceased parents. One day, a woman approaches James and offers him a million dollars to defend her son, who has been accused of raping a lady and murdering her boyfriend. Overcome by greed, James ignores his conscience, defends the accused in court, and wins the case. James gets into a car accident later and his face is injured so badly that he has to undergo reconstructive surgery. When the bandages are removed, James is horrified to see that he now looks exactly like the rape victim's deceased boyfriend. The fourth segment is set in Hong Kong in 1999. An old woman and her granddaughter Yu are waiting for the latter's cousin Ming to come home from his overseas studies. When Ming returns, he brings along his girlfriend, Judy, and announces his decision to marry her. Yu becomes very jealous because she is in love with Ming.

Panitz, The Internet Society (June 1999) However, local has since been designated for use in link-local networking by RFC 6762,RFC 6762, Multi-cast DNS, S. Chesire, M. Krochmal (February 2013). in applications of multicast DNS (mDNS) and zero- configuration networking (zeroconf) so that DNS service may be established without local installations of conventional DNS infrastructure on local area networks. Multicast DNS (mDNS) standard The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards-track RFC 6762 (February 20, 2013) reserves the use of the domain name label local as a pseudo-top-level domain for hostnames in local area networks that can be resolved via the Multicast DNS name resolution protocol. Any DNS query for a name ending with the label local must be sent to the mDNS IPv4 link-local multicast address 224.0.0.251, or its IPv6 equivalent FF02::FB. Domain name ending in local, may be resolved concurrently via other mechanisms, for example, unicast DNS. mDNS implementations RFC 6762 was authored by Apple Inc. employees Stuart Cheshire and Marc Krochmal, and Apple's Bonjour zeroconf networking software implements mDNS. Nicholas Valbusa gave a talk on this subject.https://www.slideshare.net/squallstar/apple- bonjour-lets-talk That service will automatically resolve the private IP addresses of link-local Macintosh computers running MacOS and mobile devices running iOS if .local is appended to their hostnames. In addition, Bonjour devices will use those .local hostnames when advertising services to DNS Service Discovery clients. Most Linux distributions also incorporate and are configured to use zero configuration networking. By default, each computer‚Äôs Avahi daemon will respond to mDNS hostname.local queries, and most shell commands and application program calls that attempt to resolve such names are routed to that daemon by the default hosts: line in the Name Service Switch configuration file. It is also possible to configure the nss-mdns modules and Avahi to resolve hostnames with other pseudo-TLDs. Although Windows operating systems often do not have built-in mDNS function, it can be added by installing zeroconf software available from Apple and other third parties, and it is beginning to be added in Windows 10. Finally, many printers and other peripheral devices also implement the mDNS protocol in order to provide simplified connections to them from computers that implement zero configuration networking. Microsoft recommendations The connection of Macintosh and Linux computers or zeroconf peripherals to Windows networks can be problematic if those networks include name servers that use .local as a search domain for internal devices. At one time, Microsoft at least suggested the use of .local as a pseudo-TLD for small private networks with internal DNS servers, via documents that (as of this writing) are still accessible. For example, support article 296250 included the following option: However, more recent articles have cautioned or advised against such use of the .local TLD. Support article 300684 listed contoso.local as an example of a \\"best-practice Active Directory domain name\\", but then added: which would of course preclude using that or any other domain ending with .local. Microsoft TechNet article 708159 suggested .local for the exact opposite reason: but later recommended against it: TechNet article 726016 cautioned against using .local: By default, a freshly installed Windows Server 2016 Essentials also adds .local as the default dns-prefix, when a user doesn't select the advanced option. Thus resulting in a domain with .local extension. Linux Computers running modern Linux distributions and using the common \`nsswitch\` system may have \`/etc/nsswitch.conf\` configuration files in which mDNS name resolution was added via the mdns4_minimal plugin to \`nsswitch\`. In this configuration, where \`mdns4_minimal\` precedes the standard \`dns\` option, which uses \`/etc/resolv.conf\`, the mDNS resolution will block subsequent DNS resolution on the local network. hosts: files mdns_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns or hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns This is a configuration choice made by distributions such as Ubuntu/Debian and SuSE and Red Hat, each of which have their own package configuration script that will install the mdns_minimal module as above. In this way .local requests are being prevented from leaking to the internet, but also block legitimate .local requests for configured DNS servers. Global DNS queries As local is an officially reserved special-use domain name (RFC 6762 of February 2013) host names with this top level label are not resolvable in the global Domain Name System. However, a considerable proportion of the queries submitted to it do specify the domain. Statistics for the L root name server operated by ICANN show that on August 14, 2015, the server received approximately 1331 local queries per second, third in frequency after .com (4355 queries/s), and .net (2481 queries/s), or sixth including the invalid gTLDs www (First, with 9416 queries/s), html (third, with 2727 queries/s), and home (fifth, with 1692 queries/s).root-servers.orgICANN.org On April 12, 2013, the server received approximately 2300 local queries/s, fourth in frequency after .com, .net, and .org.

The project was released as the work of \\"Brian May + Friends\\", consisting of May, guitarist Eddie Van Halen, drummer Alan Gratzer (of REO Speedwagon), Phil Chen (session bassist who played with Jeff Beck and Rod Stewart), and Fred Mandel (session keyboard player who also played as additional keyboard player on Queen's Hot Space World Tour and The Works). Roger Taylor, Queen's drummer, provided backing vocals for the title song. It was not meant for the tapes to be released and they had minimal mixing before release.  Production  Recorded on 21 and 22 April 1983 at the Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles, California, it was released in October of the same year as a Mini-LP, a \\"challenge to the established principle that a piece of rock music must fit into either a 2x4 minute single, or a 2x20 minute LP format\\". The LP consisted of three songs: \\"Star Fleet\\", \\"Let Me Out\\", and \\"Blues Breaker\\". The idea for the album came from May's son, Jimmy. \\"Let Me Out\\" was an old Brian May song which until that point had not been committed to record. During the song Eddie Van Halen \\"tortures his top string to its audible death\\" (according to May's liner notes) and plays the rest of the song on the remaining five. \\"Blues Breaker\\" was dedicated to Eric Clapton, of whom both Van Halen and May were huge fans. This song, as well as \\"Let Me Out\\" were more spontaneous than \\"Star Fleet\\", showing both guitarists enjoying a jamming session, with Brian showing off his signature sound and Van Halen using his tapping technique to great effect (although the best example of this is at the beginning of \\"Star Fleet\\").  Releases  Previously only available on vinyl and 4-track cassette (as a \\"demo\\" (1984)), \\"Star Fleet\\" is now available on CD in two forms. It was first re-issued on CD as part of Brian May's \\"Back to the Light\\" single. There were two CD singles ‚Äì the first (which came in a special pack with space for the second CD) featured \\"Star Fleet\\" and \\"Let Me Out\\". The second had \\"Blues Breaker\\" on it. Then in 1993 it was re-issued as part of the Japanese mini- album \\"Resurrection\\", featuring the three Star Fleet Project songs as tracks 6-8, albeit in a different order from the original vinyl release.

According to writer Toby Lester, his examination revealed \\"unconventional verse orderings, minor textual variations, and rare styles of orthography and artistic embellishment.\\" The scriptures were written in the early Hijazi Arabic script, matching the pieces of the earliest Qurans known to exist. Some of the papyrus on which the text appears shows clear signs of earlier use, being that previous, washed-off writings are also visible on it. In 2008 and 2009 Dr Elisabeth Puin published detailed results of the analysis of Sanaa manuscript DAM (dar al-makhtutat) 01.27-1 proving that the text was still in flux in the time span between the scriptio inferior and the scriptio superior of the palimpsest. More than 15,000 sheets of the Yemeni Qurans have painstakingly been cleaned, treated, sorted, cataloged and photographed and 35,000 microfilmed photos have been made of the manuscripts.

Books are selected and endorsed by a panel of judges, and members choose which book they would like to receive, similar to how the club originally operated when it began in 1926. Members can also discuss the books with fellow members in an online forum. In late 2015, in concert with the club's 90th year, the club announced a relaunch into its current iteration. Within two years, the club had grown its membership to more than 100,000 members, primarily millennial women, and the club's presence on social media grew to over 300,000 Instagram followers. Approximately 75% of the club's titles are by up-and-coming authors, and 80% of titles are fiction. The club has also worked with a series of celebrity guest judges who bring broader awareness to new titles, and continues producing its own versions of books that feature special endpapers and casings. In 2016, the club launched a Book of the Year award. In 2017, the club debuted its first ever television advertisement called \\"Monthly\\". The club has a tradition of focusing on debut and emerging writers, and is known for having helped launch the careers of some of the most acclaimed authors in American literary history. In 1926 (its first year in operation), the Club featured Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. In 1936 (its tenth year), the Club selected Gone with the Wind by unknown author Margaret Mitchell. Today, the book remains the second favorite of American readers (after the Bible). Mitchell wrote: \\"I wanted to thank [Book of the Month] from the bottom of my heart for selecting my book. It was quite the most exciting and unexpected thing that ever happened to me.\\" In 1951 (its 25th year), the club distributed its 100 millionth book and selected J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, which became both the most-censored and the most-taught book in America. In 1978, the Club selected By the Rivers of Babylon, the first book by Nelson DeMille, who later wrote: \\"I will be forever grateful to Book of the Month for ensuring that my first book, By the Rivers of Babylon, was not my last. When the Club selected Babylon in 1978, it reached hundreds of thousands of additional readers and became an instant best-seller.\\" History Harry Scherman was a copywriter for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in 1916 when he set out to create the \\"Little Leather Library\\". With his partners Max Sackheim, and Charles and Albert Boni, Scherman began a mail order service that offered \\"30 Great Books For $2.98\\" (miniature reprints \\"bound in limp Redcroft\\") and sold 40 million copies in its first five years.\\"Harry Scherman,\\" Current Biography 1943, pp 669-671 Sackheim and Scherman then founded their own ad agency devoted entirely to marketing books. The problems of building interest in a new book led Scherman to create, along with Sackheim and Robert Haas (son of Kalman Haas), the Book- of-the-Month Club in 1926. As Scherman explained it, the club itself would be a \\"standard brand\\". \\"It establishes itself as a sound selector of good books and sells by means of its own prestige. Thus, the prestige of each new title need not be built up before becoming acceptable,\\" he explained later. After starting with 4,000 subscribers, the club had more than 550,000 within twenty years. The size of the club did in fact create the Book of the Month Club as a brand. Being a \\"Book of the Month Club\\" selection was used to promote books to the general public. Book of the Month Club was acquired by Time Inc. in 1977; Time Inc. merged with Warner Communications in 1989. The original judges panel was eliminated in 1994. In 2000, the Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc. merged with Doubleday Direct, Inc. The resulting company, Bookspan, was a joint venture between Time Warner and Bertelsmann until 2007 when Bertelsmann took over complete ownership. In 2008, Bertelsmann sold its US subscription business to the private equity firm Najafi Companies. In 2013, Najafi sold Bookspan to current parent company Pride Tree Holdings, Inc.  Membership terms  The club operates a subscription program, similar to other box subscription services, where customers select a membership plan for a set period of time (3-months, 6-months or 12-months) and books are shipped to all members during the first seven days of the month. Historically, when the club operated through mail-order catalogs, membership involved a \\"negative response\\" system whereby a member was shipped the monthly selection on a particular date if the selection was not declined before that date. Members had the option to respond by declining the selection or opting to order another book or merchandise instead. No response was deemed acceptance of the selection.  Book of the Year Award  In late 2016, the club announced its first annual Book of the Year Award, the finalists for which are chosen by the club's members. The award is called the \\"Lolly\\", in tribute to Lolly Willowes, the first book selected by the club back in 1926. \\"Lolly Willowes\\" was written by Sylvia Townsend Warner, who later went on to become a prolific writer and even wrote short stories for The New Yorker. In 2017, the award added a $10,000 prize, and the winner was The Hearts Invisible Furies by Irish author John Boyne. In 2018, the members voted Circe by Madeline Miller as best book of the year. In 2019, the members voted Daisy Jones & The Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid as best book of the year.

The units colloquially known as Gl√§serner Zug (Glass Train) were equipped with large panorama windows, providing an excellent outside view to the passengers. The vehicles were used for recreational trips only, especially in southern Germany and Austria.  History  Two units with the wheel arrangement Bo'2' were built in 1935 by Waggonfabrik Fuchs in Heidelberg and AEG. They were numbered elT 1998 (cream with red underside) and 1999 (dark green with yellow (lower) and grey (upper) window wrap). ET 91 02 was destroyed on March 9, 1943, in a bomb attack on the Munich shunting yard. ET 91 01 survived World War II without major damage and was taken over by the Deutsche Bundesbahn From 1968 on, it was listed as Baureihe 491 in the DB numbering scheme, being assigned the number 491 001-4. The train had been refurbished 5 times during its lifetime (1949, 1953, 1961, 1972, 1985), and suffered a number of changes to its livery. Between 1949 and 1953 it wore the Rheingold livery, that was grey underside, purple bodywork and cream wrap. Between 1953 and 1971 it had a black underside (standard underside paint still used today), maroon bodywork and custard window wrap. Between 1972 and 1985 this livery is changed to light blue bodywork and silver wrap. The last livery was applied from 1985 to 1995 (technically speaking it is still used today) and featured a marine dark bodywork and white window wrap. On December 12, 1995, the remaining unit suffered extensive damage in a frontal crash at Garmisch-Partenkirchen with 1044 235 of the Austrian Federal Railways and was subsequently taken out of service. The unit has been stationed at the Bahnpark Augsburg in Augsburg since May 2005.

A 1981 outbreak in Spain killed over 600 people and is thought to have been caused by contaminated colza oil. Its first appearance was as a lung disease, with unusual features: though the symptoms initially resembled a lung infection, antibiotics were ineffective. The disease appeared to be restricted to certain geographical localities, and several members of a family could be affected, even while their neighbours had no symptoms. Following the acute phase, a range of other chronic symptoms was apparent. Cause  The cause of the syndrome was traced to the consumption of colza oil that had been intended for industrial rather than food use. To discourage human consumption, the oil was denatured by the addition of aniline to make it smell and taste bad. It was then imported as cheap industrial oil by the company RAPSA at San Sebasti√°n, handled by RAELCA, and illegally refined by ITH in Seville to remove the aniline, resulting in a palatable product that could then be illegally sold. It was sold as \\"olive oil\\" by street vendors at weekly street markets, and was used on salads and for cooking. The commonly accepted hypothesis states that toxic compounds derived during the refinement process were responsible. Once the origin of the syndrome was realised, public health officials organized an exchange programme, whereby those who had bought the oil could exchange it for pure olive oil, thereby quickly ending the outbreak.  Alternative mechanisms  The conclusion of the Joint WHO/CISAT Scientific Committee for the Toxic Oil Syndrome from 2002, that oil was the cause for TOS, is based only on epidemiological evidence, since up to now, experimental studies performed in a variety of laboratory animals have failed to reproduce the symptoms of human TOS. None of the in vivo or in vitro studies performed with toxic-oil-specific components, such as fatty acid anilides, and esters of 3-(N-phenylamino)-1,2-propanediol (abbreviated as PAP), have provided evidence that these markers are causally involved in the pathogenesis of TOS.Toxic Oil Syndrome - 10 Years of Progress Specifically, three possible causative agents of TOS are PAP (3-(N-phenylamino)-1,2-propanediol), the 1,2-dioleoyl ester of PAP (abbreviated OOPAP), and the 3-oleoyl ester of PAP (abbreviated OPAP). These three compounds are formed by means of similar chemical processes, and oil that contains one of the three substances is likely to contain the other two. Oil samples that are suspected to have been ingested by people who later developed TOS often contain all three of these contaminants (among other substances), but are most likely to contain OOPAP. However, when these three substances were given to laboratory animals, OOPAP was not acutely toxic, PAP was toxic only after injection, but not after oral administration, and OPAP was toxic only after injection of high doses. Therefore, none of these three substances is thought to cause TOS. Similar results were obtained after administration of fatty acid anilides. Data discrepancies combined with both a high level of secrecy surrounding the huge investigation and the fact that the first cases of the syndrome were located in Madrid (near the U.S. military base in Torrej√≥n de Ardoz) spread the idea of a conspiracy. Several of those affected by TOS claim they never consumed any of the tainted oil products. Furthermore, the tainted oil was primarily sold in low-cost street markets; yet, a considerable percentage of the patients were wealthy. Another theory suggests the toxic reaction was triggered by organophosphate poisoning (e. g., from pesticide residues in tomatoes of a new product being field tested by BASF) and covered up by the Spanish government and the WHO.

Its goal was to provide a source of accurate and comprehensive data that could be used to answer basic questions about the behavior of stock markets. The first effort of the Center was the production of a database consisting of monthly stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange for all common stocks from 1926 to 1962. Dividends, shares outstanding, capital changes, and delisting information was also included. Taken together, this data made possible the first comprehensive study of the rates of return on common stocks.Fisher & Lorie, \\"Rates of Return on Investments in Common Stocks\\" Since then the database has been kept up to date to the present day, daily data has been expanded back to 1926, and other exchanges and financial instruments have been added.

The TSSAA (commonly pronounced \\"Tee double-S double-A\\") is the only high school athletic organization in the United States to have a five- sport, Olympic-style spring sport championship tournament, known as Spring Fling, for baseball, softball, track and field, team and individual tennis, and soccer. Spring Fling began in Chattanooga in 1993, later moving to Memphis, and then establishing itself in Murfreesboro. The TSSAA was one of the first high school athletic organizations to host a central site for football championships, beginning in 1982. Description The Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association administers sporting events for an estimated 110,000 participants, 374 schools, 4,000 coaches, 3,000 officials, and 5,500 teams in the state of Tennessee. First organized in 1925, the TSSAA oversees athletic functions of both public and private schools. It includes schools throughout the state of Tennessee, as well as a single private school located in Mississippi. In 2001, the association was a party in the United States Supreme Court case Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association.Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assn., 531 U.S. 288 (2001). Brentwood Academy had sued the Association after the school was penalized for \\"undue influence\\" in recruiting football players, and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court. The court in this case held that a statewide association, incorporated to regulate interscholastic athletic competition among public and private schools, is regarded as engaging in state action when it enforces a rule against a member school. The fall of 2009 was the first year for the TSSAA to divide into six playoff classifications for football. The new system allowed more teams into the playoffs. The state championship game for football, the BlueCross Bowl, which is held three consecutive days, ending the first Saturday of December, and includes Division I classes 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A, as well as Div. II A and AA, has been held at Tennessee Tech University's Tucker Stadium in Cookeville since 2009. Classification Each school chooses to compete in Division I or Division II. Division I schools are schools which generally allow students to attend without payment of tuition, i.e., public schools, except that tuition may be charged to a student who is a resident of the county in which a school is located but outside of a city school district or special school district, in which case the tuition is the difference between the amount of additional funding per student provided by the city or special school district above that provided by the state and county. Division II schools are independent schools which charge tuition to students' families. Financial aid is allowed provided it is limited to a need-based amount, and that the percentage of athletes receiving aid is no greater than for the school's students as a whole. The two divisions compete separately in all sports except cheerleading and girls' wrestling. Division I schools are divided into three classes, as equally as possible, based on enrollment. A school's enrollment is multiplied by 2 if it is single-sex (the only single- sex school in Division I is Chattanooga Girls' Leadership Academy). Division II schools whose enrollment (with the single-sex multiplier taken into account) is below the smallest school in Division I Class AA are Class A; larger schools are Class AA. Finally, any school that wishes to play in a higher class may do so, but must do so for all sports other than football. A full reclassification is held every four years; at the midpoint, any school that has had a 20% increase or decrease in enrollment will be moved to the class appropriate to its new enrollment (a school that will be moved down may decline). =Football classification= Starting with the 2015 season, a new classification system was implemented for Division I football, separate from those of other sports. The 31 largest schools in the state, plus Maryville playing up by request, will constitute Class 6A; the remaining football- playing schools are divided as equally as possible into classes 1A through 5A. The option to play up will apply separately to football and to the rest of the sports. The 2015-2016 year varied from 2014-2015 only due to 20%-change adjustments. =Districts and Regions= For each sport, the schools competing are divided into regions, and/or districts depending on the sport. Division I *Basketball, Baseball, Softball, and Volleyball: Eight regions in each of the three classes, with two districts per region. *Football (starting 2015): Four regions in Class 6A, eight regions each in 1A through 5A, with no districts. *Soccer, Golf, and Tennis: Class AAA is as in basketball. Classes AA and A are combined, with districts/regions of the same number in the two classes competing together regardless of geography. (For example, soccer District 7 combines district 7-A in the Upper Cumberland Plateau with district 7-AA in western Chattanooga.) *Cross-Country: As soccer, but with no districts (the state series begins with region meets). *Track and Field: Class AAA has four sections (pairs of basketball/etc. regions). Class A-AA has three sections, namely the three grand divisions. *Wrestling: In Class AAA, eight regions with two districts, but not the same as for other sports. (Districts are used only for the dual-meet series.) In Class A-AA, eight regions for duals, and three larger regions for the traditional series (note that one dual region is split between two traditional regions). *Bowling: A single class with eight regions containing from one to four districts each. Division II *Most sports: Two regions in each of the two classes, one consisting of the East and Middle grand divisions, the other the West. *Football: Each of the two Class A regions is split into two districts. *Cross-Country: No Class AA regions (all 11 teams enter the state meet). *Track and Field: One class with three regions (East and Middle are separate). *Wrestling, Bowling: One class with the usual two regions. Combined Divisions *Girls' Wrestling: Two regions, East and West. *Cheerleading/Dance: Classes are determined by number of competitors on the team and by the style of performance, as per cheerleading/dance tradition. Administration The TSSAA divides Tennessee's 95 counties, and the state's constituent Grand Divisions, into nine \\"athletic districts\\": * District 1: Carter, Claiborne, Cocke, Grainger, Greene, Hamblen, Hancock, Hawkins, Jefferson, Johnson, Sevier, Sullivan, Unicoi, and Washington counties * District 2: Anderson, Blount, Campbell, Knox, Loudon, McMinn, Monroe, Morgan, Roane, Scott, and Union counties * District 3: Bledsoe, Bradley, Grundy, Hamilton, Marion, Meigs, Polk, Rhea, and Sequatchie counties * District 4: Bedford, Cannon, Clay, Coffee, Cumberland, DeKalb, Fentress, Franklin, Jackson, Lincoln, Marshall, Moore, Overton, Pickett, Putnam, Rutherford, Smith, Van Buren, Warren, White, and Wilson counties * District 5: Davidson, Macon, Montgomery, Robertson, Stewart, Sumner, and Trousdale counties * District 6: Cheatham, Dickson, Hickman, Houston, Humphreys, Giles, Lawrence, Lewis, Maury, Perry, Wayne, and Williamson counties * District 7: Benton, Carroll, Chester, Decatur, Fayette, Hardeman, Hardin, Henderson, Henry, Madison, and McNairy counties * District 8: Crockett, Dyer, Gibson, Haywood, Lake, Lauderdale, Obion, Tipton, and Weakley counties * District 9: Shelby County ** East Tennessee comprises Districts 1, 2, and 3. ** Middle Tennessee comprises Districts 4, 5, and 6. ** West Tennessee comprises Districts 7, 8, and 9. These districts are unrelated to the competitive districts above (although a few sports do use the grand divisions as regions); their primary purpose is to elect the Board of Control (the administrative authority) and the Legislative Council. Each district elects one member to each for a staggered three-year term; in addition, starting in November 2015, three additional members will be chosen to represent non-public schools, one from each grand division. Out-of-state teams The sole out-of-state school that is a member of the TSSAA is Northpoint Christian School in Southaven, Mississippi, a suburb of Memphis. Northpoint votes in the Athletic District 9 elections. Cities and towns near Tennessee's borders with surrounding states, i.e. Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, or Virginia, such as Bristol, Chattanooga, Clarksville, and Memphis, do have various schools, both public and private, who play nearby out-of-state teams (which are not TSSAA members) on a regular basis, e.g. Heritage High School in Ringgold, Georgia for Chattanooga teams or Virginia High School in Bristol, Virginia for Bristol, TN teams. Notes *The only exception is Fort Campbell High School on the Tennessee side of the eponymous U.S. Army base. The base straddles the Kentucky-Tennessee border, most of the base housing is in Kentucky, and the school is administered by the same Department of Defense district as the high school at Fort Knox in Kentucky. Fort Campbell High is therefore a member of the Kentucky High School Athletic Association. Northpoint Christian School, located a short distance across the Mississippi state line, is a TSSAA member under a rule provision permitting TSSAA membership for a school that relocates from Tennessee to another state if the majority of students at the school are Tennessee residents.

The posterior capsule is a band of fibrous tissue that interconnects with tendons of the rotator cuff of the shoulder. Four muscles and their tendons make up the rotator cuff. They cover the outside of the shoulder to hold, protect and move the joint. Overuse can lead to a buildup of tissue around the posterior capsule called hypertrophy. The next step is tightness of the posterior capsule called posterior capsular contracture. This type of problem reduces the amount the shoulder can rotate inwardly. Over time, with enough force, a tear may develop in the labrum. The labrum is a rim of cartilage around the shoulder socket to help hold the head of the humerus (upper arm) in the joint. This condition is called a superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) lesion. The final outcome in all these steps is the dead arm phenomenon. The shoulder is unstable and dislocation may come next. Dead arm syndrome will not go away on its own with rest‚Äîit must be treated. If there is a SLAP lesion, then surgery is needed to repair the problem. If the injury is caught before a SLAP tear, then physical therapy with stretching and exercise can restore it. It is common among baseball pitchers as they age, and it can also occur with quarterbacks in football and handball players also as they age.

Most cycling power meters use strain gauges to measure torque applied, and when combined with angular velocity, calculate power. The technology was adapted to cycling in the late 1980s and was tested in professional bicycle racing i.e.: the prototype Power Pacer (Team Strawberry) and by Greg LeMond with the SRM device. This type of power meter has been commercially available since 1989. Training using a power meter is increasingly popular. Power meters generally transmit data wirelessly and can be paired to standard bike computers. By providing an instantaneous feedback to the athlete, and by allowing more precise analysis of rides, power meters can be a useful tool for training. Interfaces Older cycling power meters use a set of wires to transmit power information to a computer mounted on the bicycle; this system has a serious disadvantage of having fine electrical cables being run all over the bicycle, making it harder to clean as well as using a fair number of fasteners to hold them up. However, since 2009 there is a general trend to move towards wireless systems. Power meters generally transmit data over ANT+ or Bluetooth Low Energy protocols and can be paired to standard bike computers that display information about the power output generated by the rider. Use in training Power meters provide an objective measurement of real output that allows training progress to be tracked very simply‚Äîsomething that is more difficult when using, for example, a heart rate monitor alone. Cyclists will often train at different intensities depending on the adaptations they are seeking. A common practice is to use different intensity zones. When training with power, these zones are usually calculated from the power output corresponding to the so-called lactate threshold or MAP (maximal aerobic power). Power meters provide instant feedback to the rider about their performance and measure their actual output; heart rate monitors measure the physiological effect of effort and therefore ramp up more slowly. Thus, an athlete performing \\"interval\\" training while using a power meter can instantly see that they are producing 300 watts, for example, instead of waiting for their heart rate to climb to a certain point. In addition, power meters measure the force that moves the bike forward multiplied by the velocity, which is the desired goal. This has two significant advantages over heart rate monitors: 1) An athlete's heart rate may remain constant over the training period, yet their power output is declining, which they cannot detect with a heart rate monitor; 2) While an athlete who is not rested or not feeling entirely well may train at their normal heart rate, they are unlikely to be producing their normal power‚Äîa heart rate monitor will not reveal this, but a power meter will. Further, power meters enable riders to experiment with cadence and evaluate its effect relative to speed and heart rate. Power meters further encourage cyclists to contemplate all aspects of the sport in terms of power because power output is an essential, quantitative link between physiological fitness and speed achievable under certain conditions. A cyclist's VO2 max (a proxy for fitness) can be closely related to power output using principles of biochemistry, while power output can serve as a parameter to power-speed models founded in Newton's laws of motion, thus accurately estimating speed. The joint application of power meters and power models has led to increasingly more scientific analyses of riding environments and physical properties of the cyclist, in particular aerodynamic drag. = Dual- sided power measurement = Dual-sided power meters, generally direct applied force or pedal power meters, can measure the power generated individually by the left leg and the right leg. The resulting data allow monitoring the dominant/non-dominant leg ratio and observe how it varies in relation to different racing and fitness conditions. This can be useful to correct penalizing imbalances, and in post-traumatic rehabilitation programs. Power meter types Most cycling power meters use strain gauges to measure torque applied, and when combined with angular velocity, calculate power. Power meters using strain gauges are mounted in the bottom bracket, rear freehub, or crankset. Certain newer devices do not use strain gauges and instead measure power through handlebar-mounted units that utilize the principles of Newton's Third Law by measuring a cyclist's opposing forces (gravity, wind resistance, inertia, rolling resistance) and combining these with velocity to determine the rider's power output. =Crank or Spider= Crank and Spider based power meters measure the torque applied through both pedals via strain gauge/s positioned within the crank or crank spider. A calculation of power is derived from the deflection of the strain gauge/s and pedaling cadence. While most crank based power meters measure the power output of one leg only or need a second sensor to measure the power output of both legs, the spider based power meters always measure the total power output of both legs. These units require specific cranks or cranksets, but can be relatively simple to interchange between bikes, depending on compatibility. = Pedals = Pedal based power meters can be located either in the pedal axle or in the pedal body. This type of cycling power meter measures the cyclist‚Äôs force exactly where it is applied, through one or both pedals. Power meters with sensors on both pedals can provide a real dual-sided power measurement, that is power data gathered individually on both legs. This feature is useful to observe and correct penalizing differences in performance between legs. Power meter pedals are easy to install and swap across bikes. =Bottom bracket= Bottom bracket with connection cables Bottom bracket power meters rely on the torsional deflection in the BB shaft. This is done by the shaft having a disc at each end with perforations. These perforations are detected using non-contact photo-electric sensors that detect when torque is applied to the left pedal and then doubled. Data is sent digitally to a handlebar mounted computer unit. These units are difficult to interchange and require a different bottom bracket unit for each bike. =Freehub= A freehub power meter uses the same strain gauges that are present in the crank power meters, but it is located in the rear wheel hub and measures the power at the rear wheel. The power measured by a freehub power meter will be slightly less that the power measured by a crank-based power meter due to power losses in the chain, pedals, and bottom bracket. Because freehub power meters are built into the rear wheel, it is simple to interchange them among bikes so long as the wheels are compatible. =Chain= At the heart of chain units is essentially a guitar pick-up that mounts to the cycle's chain stay. The pick-up detects chain vibration from which it calculates chain tension which, along with chain speed, gives power output. Finnish company Polar was the first to bring a chain-based power meter to market. =Opposing force= Opposing force power meters measure hill slope (gravity), bike acceleration (inertia) and, sometimes, wind speed. From this, power can be indirectly calculated. =Direct applied force= This method monitors the forces applied to the pedal by the cyclist's foot. Sensors in the shoe or pedal measure the forces as the cranks rotate, and calculate the power based on the magnitude and direction of the applied force, and the angular velocity of the crank. Advantages of this technique include independent measurement of power for each leg, measurement of efficiency of pedaling style, and (depending on placement of sensors) avoiding the need to replace bike components.

It can also be used when there is no-one available to bowl, or no one of the desired style or standard. There are a number of different types of bowling machine available to cricket coaches, each quite different in the ways they achieve the required delivery, though most allow the use of remote control, so that a coach can be closer to a batsman when the stroke is played.  Mechanical bowling machines  This type of machine is by far the most common. It is simple, strong and reliable, as well as being able to bowl a useful range of deliveries. = How they work = The main mechanism of the machine consists of two heavy wheels, between 30 and 50 cm in diameter, fitted with solid or pneumatic rubber tyres, each driven by its own electric motor. These are mounted in a frame such that the wheels are in the same plane, about 7 cm apart (slightly less than the diameter of a cricket ball). A ball joint allows the machine a wide range of movement. The whole assembly is mounted on a sturdy tripod or other frame so that the plane of the wheels is roughly at the height that a typical bowler would release the ball. A chute delivers the ball between the wheels, protecting the coach‚Äôs hands. The motors are typically powered by a car battery, and turn in opposite directions. A controller allows variation of the speed of each wheel, allowing the machine to be slowed down for less experienced batsmen, or when the motors are not running at the same speed, swing or spin bowling can be simulated. These machines will work with any ball of roughly the right size and weight, such as normal cricket balls or tennis balls. However, they usually work best with their own balls, bowling machine balls which are made of hard plastic, and are covered in dimples. These dimples are to help with the swinging characteristics when this type of delivery is desired. = Simulating different deliveries =  Fast bowling  This is achieved by setting both wheels to the same speed, as fast as the batsman is able to deal with, although the machine itself would have to be tipped horizontally. The coach can move the machine around slightly to vary the line and length of each ball.  Swing bowling  The plane of the wheels is flat, and the motors are set to run at slightly different speeds. This means the ball will spin about an axis perpendicular to the ground, causing it to swing due to the Magnus effect. If the ball is spinning anticlockwise (looking from above) the ball will swing from right to left; clockwise spin results in a swing from left to right. This means that if the coach slows down the wheel on one side, ball will swing in that direction. The swing produced in this way is different from normal swing bowling, however - it is much more like a curling ball in football.  Spin bowling  To achieve spin, the machine should be tilted to one side, and the wheels set to different speeds as per swing bowling. It will also probably be necessary to make the machine bowl significantly more slowly. The combined action of the spin imparted by the wheels, and the non-perpendicular axis of that spin will cause the ball to bounce up at an angle. While spinning always see the ball when it has been started to deliver the ball towards the wicket  Seam bowling  This is difficult to achieve since the operator cannot control exactly how the ball will roll into the machine and between the wheels. However, by the law of averages, a ball will occasionally come out with its seam at the correct angle, and bounce unpredictably as a result.  Bouncers  To get balls that bounce unnaturally high or low, the plane of the machine must be set so that it is vertical. Not all machines can do this, simply because their ball joint doesn‚Äôt give the required range of movement. To get balls that bounce higher than normal, the lower wheel should spin slightly faster than the upper. Deliveries that bounce much lower than normal are less common and are usually the result of the ball striking a broken-up patch of ground. These balls can still be simulated, however, by increasing the speed of the upper wheel.  Pneumatic bowling machines  This design is significantly less common than the mechanical type and operates using a completely different principle. = How they work = Most of the space in the machine is a hopper that contains the balls. At the bottom of the hopper, near the front, is a rotor with space for six balls. The balls slot into the spaces on the rotor by gravity, which then takes them into the innards of the mechanism. The rotor passes over a trap-door, which the ball opens with its weight, falling into a small chamber. A pump is used to provide a flow of air into the chamber that the ball drops into. The airflow pushes the ball along the chamber to rubber ring, or gasket, known as a \\"restrictor\\". The restrictor has a hole through it that is sightly smaller than the ball, which the ball presses up against. This seals the hole, so air pressure builds up in the chamber. When the pressure is so great that the restrictor can no longer hold it, the ball bursts through, out of the main body of the machine and into an external tube, which guides it upwards and releases it at the height of a bowler's arm. = Simulating different deliveries =  Fast bowling  A system exists that allows air to escape from the barrel shortly after it has passed the restrictor. This reduces the pressure on the ball, reducing its muzzle velocity. Closing this increases the speed to its maximum; its maximum speed is 160+ km/hr (100+ mph).  Swing bowling  To do this a curved piece of tubing is attached to the end of the barrel. The ball rolls around this causing it to spin and swing.  Spin bowling  The tubing used for swing bowling can also be used for spin bowling, by pointing the curve somewhere between vertical and horizontal.  Seam bowling  Seam bowling is impossible on this machine as it only accepts tennis balls and cricket training balls such as Slazenger's \\"Slazball\\" (a hard, small, low-bounce, heavy ball, similar in appearance to a tennis ball but usually red in colour). Neither of these types of ball has a seam.  Bouncers  The tubing can again be used, this time to simulate high and low bounce by mounting the tube vertically.  Programmable bowling machines  Both of the types of machines described above are fairly simple designs, intended for regular, hard use by clubs, and hence are simple to operate and reliable. They can only simulate one type of delivery with the machine in a given configuration and have other limitations, particularly with spin bowling, which limit their usefulness to players at the highest levels of the game. Programmable bowling machines are intended to overcome some of these limitations by rapidly re-configuring themselves to bowl different types of delivery in quick succession. A programmable bowling machine called \\"Merlyn\\", which its makers claimed could \\"bowl any ball known to man\\"The history page at Merlyn‚Äôs Official Website received much public attention when it was used by the English cricket team in the run-up to and during the 2005 Ashes series. Originally a one-off, Merlyn was built by Henry Pryor, a cricket coach in Herefordshire. Its mechanism has not been publicly revealed, though it is safe to assume it is much more complex than the other machines. Crucially, the machine was claimed to be able to emulate Shane Warne's leg breaks, and although he is dismissive of its usefulness,\\"Defeat will make England hungry ‚Äì Warne\\" by Jenny Thompson Cricinfo, 7 June 2006 retrieved 21 July 2006 the England batsmen disagree, and consider their ability to play spin bowling significantly improved. The machine, as well as its mechanical abilities, also has significant elements of computer-control built in. It is claimed that it can reproduce an over from a particular bowler if fed the correct data. One of the more unnerving aspects of the machine is that it provides no indication of the type of ball it is about to bowl until the ball has left the machine. This forces batsmen to work on their instinctive batting, rather than trying to second guess the bowler. An improved version is currently in development at Loughborough University, which will add visual feedback by showing a representation of the bowler projected onto a screen. The ball will be released as the virtual bowler‚Äôs hand reaches the hole from which the ball is released. This version of the machine is intended for mass production, so it can be sold to cricket clubs around the world.\\"England await Merlyn's heir\\" by Pranav Soneji, BBC, 5 June 2006, retrieved 21 July 2006 In the winter of 2009/10 the ECB acquired 20 of the machines, one for each county and two for the performance centre at Loughborough.http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/current/story/439374.html See also *Cricket clothing and equipment *Pitching machine  References  External links *\\"Merlyn proves a triumph for man and machine\\" by Matthew Pryor, \\"The Times\\" 23 July 2005 *\\"Artificially Intelligent Bowling Machines-Revolutionizes the Cricket Learning\\" by Chaitanya Vankadaru, \\"DustMoon.Com Team\\" 31 March 2016 Cricket equipment Bowling (cricket) Loughborough University ","title":"Bowling machine"},{"id":"4038334","title":"Speed skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics ‚Äì Men's 5000 metres"},{"id":"4038339","text":"Labour and Co-operative Party (often abbreviated Labour Co-op; ) is a description used by candidates in United Kingdom elections who stand on behalf of both the Labour Party and the Co-operative Party. Candidates contest elections under an electoral alliance between the two parties, that was first agreed in 1927. This agreement recognises the independence of the two parties and commits them to not standing against each other in elections. It also sets out the procedures for both parties to select joint candidates and interact at a local and national level. There were 26 Labour and Co-operative Party MPs elected at the December 2019 election, making it the fourth largest political grouping in the House of Commons, although Labour and Co-operative MPs are generally included in Labour totals. The Chair of the Co-operative Parliamentary Group is Jim McMahon and the Vice-chair is Preet Gill. Description Labour and Co-operative is a joint description registered with the Electoral Commission, appearing alongside a candidate's name on ballot papers. When elected, the designation is officially Labour and Co-operative Party, with elected representatives often meeting together in addition to being part of an official Labour group. For example, MPs and peers are members of the Co-operative Parliamentary Group. Most Labour and Co-operative candidates use the joint description but some stand under another version, particularly for local government elections and elections in Scotland, Wales and London that use a list system. In this case only one description will be used to avoid voters thinking Labour and Co-operative candidates are standing against Labour candidates; however, joint candidates are still recognised as part of the Labour and Co-operative Group if they are elected. Labour and Co- operative candidates and representatives also use a joint logo on their printed materials and websites. History The Labour Party was founded in February 1900, followed in October 1917 by the Co-operative Party. Initially both parties operated independently, but saw each other as part of a broader movement, appealing to a similar voting base. At a local level, the parties began working together, with informal pacts to stand agreed candidates to maximise the vote for centre-left candidates. The first Co-operative Party MPs also took the whip of the much larger Labour Party upon entering the House of Commons. Moves toward a formal national partnership began in 1925 with the creation of the 'Joint Committee of the Executive Committees of the Co- operative Party and Labour Party'. This Joint Committee drafted a formal agreement between the two parties that was ratified at the June 1927 Co- operative Congress at Cheltenham, becoming the first 'National Agreement', also known as the 'Cheltenham Agreement'. The Agreement was updated a number of times throughout the twentieth century, deepening the partnership between the two parties and gradually removing restrictions that formed part of earlier versions, such as a limit on the number of joint candidates in elections. The most recent National Agreement was signed in 2003 and sets out the process for selecting candidates and how the two parties can work together locally and nationally.

In 2006, Abby made her debut in the first episode of Sesame Street‚Äôs 37th season, when she moved into the neighborhood and met some of the Street's residents. On the day of her debut, her wand broke; Big Bird told her to take her wand to the Fix-It Shop where Maria would fix it. Season 40 features her CGI animated recurring segments titled Abby's Flying Fairy School which were adapted into a proper spin-off. She is also, currently the host of Abby's Amazing Adventures, with her stepbrother Rudy. The first episode aired 11/27/2018, on HBO and 9/2/2019 on PBS. Her name is a play on words of the magic word Abracadabra. Abby's magical powers are limited to popping in and out of thin air, floating when she's happy, and turning things into pumpkins. Although familiar with the world of fairy tales, Abby is astounded by such basic learning skills as drawing letters or counting, prompting her catchphrase \\"That's so magical!\\" She frequently uses her wand cell phone to call her mommy. When she's asked to return home, she says that she's \\"gotta poof.\\" She can speak a language called Dragonfly and is teaching Rosita the language, while Rosita teaches her Spanish. Along with Baby Bear, Abby begins attending school in a 2006 episode at the Storybook Community School, where Mrs. Goose is the teacher and other fairy tale characters like Hansel and Gretel are her classmates. Tony Geiss conceptualized Abby as a way to simultaneously introduce a major female character to the show and add someone from a different culture, without \\"having consciously to introduce somebody from Indonesia or India.\\" Abby's design is an intentional departure from the typical Muppet look because she's not originally from Sesame Street. The implication is that the fairies in her old neighborhood look like her. Abby's likeness has been adapted for a 43-foot balloon which premiered in the 2007 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, a full- body costume character for stage appearances and several merchandise items. In 2008, Abby was added to the cast of Plaza S√©samo, the Mexican co-production of Sesame Street, appearing in new segments where she tries to perform magic tricks with various ordinary objects. In 2009, she became the host of 3, 2, 1 Vamos!, a Latin American pre-school programming block, which first aired in English in 2010, on Canadian television. Character launch Abby Cadabby was officially announced in TV Guide, months before the 37th season debut of Sesame Street, and a press kit was issued soon after.Sesame Street - Season 37 Press Kit - The Muppets of Sesame Street Rumors had floated on the Internet before that, with an anonymous Sesame Workshop or Muppet insider revealing the addition on Muppet Wiki. She made her Street debut on August 14, 2006. Abby was scheduled to be interviewed August 10, 2006, on The Today Show on NBC; \\"NBC Special Report\\" coverage of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot pre- empted the interview.

Made a cardinal in 1887, he was named a cardinal-bishop in 1893 and elected dean of the College of Cardinals in 1915. He was thought a possible candidate for the papacy in 1903. At the start of his career, he worked in the diplomatic service of the Holy See from 1869 to 1887, serving Apostolic Delegate to several Latin American countries and as Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium and Austria. His younger brother Vincenzo (1836 ‚Äì 1930) was also a Catholic cardinal. Biography Vannutelli was born at Genazzano, in the diocese of Palestrina, where he studied and graduated in philosophy before studying theology in the Capranica College, Rome. After teaching theology at the Pontifical Seminary, he became his work in the diplomatic service of the Holy See as secretary to the Papal Nuncio in Bavaria. He became auditor to the Nuncio at the Court of Maximilian in Mexico. On 25 June 1869 he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Nicaea and on 18 July was consecrated a bishop by Cardinal Costantino Patrizi Naro. On 23 July 1869, he was named Apostolic Delegate to Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, and Central America, which comprised countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua. He was made Apostolic Nuncio to Brussels in 1875, but his role there ended abruptly when Belgian government broke off diplomatic relations with the Holy See on 28 June 1880. He became Apostolic Nuncio to Austria on 18 November of that year. His service as a nuncio ended when Pope Leo XIII made him a cardinal on 4 March 1887. As a Cardinal-Priest he was initially assigned the title of Santa Sabina, and then assigned to San Girolamo dei Croati on 11 February 1889. On 16 January 1893, after Vannutelli reportedly declined an appointment as Secretary of State, Pope Leo XIII named him Archbishop of Bologna, an assignment considered an exile from Rome. The Pope wrote a letter to the people of Bologna saying that he had been guided by divine inspiration in making the appointment and was reported to have said \\"Vannutelli goes to Bologna Cardinal and will return a Pope\\". The New York Times commented: \\"He has for some time been prominently mentioned in connection with the Papal succession, and is supported by an influential ecclesiastical party, with whom, it is believed, Pope Leo is in sympathy.\\" He served until he was named Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati just six months later on 12 June 1893. From 1899 until his death in 1915 he was Major Penitentiary of Apostolic Penitentiary. He served as Secretary of the Congregation for Universal Inquisition (later known as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith), from 16 January 1903 until he resigned that office on 31 December 1908 at the age of 74. On 22 June 1903 he was moved from Frascati to become Cardinal-Bishop of Porto Santa e Rufina. At the conclave in 1903 that elected Pope Pius X, he was considered a contender for election to the papacy. On 25 May 1914, Pope Pius X approved his election as Dean of the College of Cardinals, adding the title of Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia to his other titles. Performing the duties of Dean during the conclave that met in August 1914 proved challenging as he was \\"almost blind ... stone deaf ... and weakened from nervous prostration\\". En route to that conclave from Naples, his train was bombed and several other passengers were injured. He died in Rome on 19 August 1915.

It was awarded a Newbery Honor. The novel is set in Zimbabwe in the year 2194, with a strong theme of Afrofuturism. Combining elements of science fiction and African culture, the book depicts the struggle of a notorious general's three children to escape from their kidnappers in the technologically advanced and crime-infested capital of Zimbabwe.  Plot  In Zimbabwe in the year 2194, Chief of Security General Matsika leads a battle against the gangs which terrorize the nation. His three children, Tendai, Rita, and Kuda, are kept in a fortified mansion to ensure their security. Seeking adventure to earn the Scout Badge, they escape the house with the help of the Mellower, a praise singer employed by their parents. The children then find themselves in the busy streets of Mbare Musika, where they are kidnapped and taken to Dead Man's Vlei, the lair of the She Elephant, a child trafficker. There, they are forced to work in the plastic mines. Their parents enlist the help of the Ear, the Eye, and the Arm, three mutant detectives. Ear has super-sensitive hearing; Eye has hawk-like vision; Arm has empathic powers which allow him to sense others' feelings and see into their souls. Tendai realizes that the She Elephant is planning to sell them to the Masks, a gang who have evaded General Matsika's efforts to combat crime. The siblings escape to Resthaven, an independent country within Zimbabwe which aims to retain traditional African culture. Eventually, the children are banished from Resthaven. The children seek help from the Mellower's mother, Mrs. Horsepool- Worthingham, who takes them into her care. Tendai discovers that the Mellower's mother is holding them for ransom. The She Elephant again captures the children and takes them to one of the Masks' secret lairs. The Masks take the children to the Mile-High MacIlwaine, a skyscraper which houses the Gondwannan Embassy, the real headquarters of the Masks. While the Masks attempt to sacrifice Tendai to their gods, Arm is possessed by a mhondoro, a holy and legendary spirit of the land, who helps him to find the children. When Arm is knocked out, the mhondoro helps Tendai and his friends to incapacitate the Big-Head Mask, a manifestation of a Gondwannan god. When the children's parents arrive, the She Elephant crushes the Mask, and the mhondoro revives Arm. The gang is destroyed and their stolen wealth is redistributed among the poor. The children reunite with their parents, and General Matsika allows his children to have freedom. Reception Kirkus Reviews found that \\"Farmer has created a splendidly imaginative fantasy\\", while Publishers Weekly wrote \\"Farmer uses her knowledge of Africa to imagine a city in 23rd-century Zimbabwe, combining old traditions and speculative technology with delightfully entertaining results\\", and concluded \\"Farmer is emerging as one of the best and brightest authors for the YA audience\\".

It was founded on April 5, 2012 by Ajay Major and Aleena Paul, two medical students at Albany Medical College, as the first online publication in the United States that is written, edited, and produced entirely by medical students. in-Training identifies itself as \\"the agora of the medical student community\\" and strives to be the intellectual center for news, commentary, and the free expression of the medical student voice. in-Training is edited and managed entirely by an independent editorial board of over 40 volunteer, unpaid medical students. in-Training publishes a wide array of written content generated by medical students, as well as artistic works. Content is published continuously throughout the year in a blog format on the magazine‚Äôs website, in-training.org. in-Training published a print book entitled in-Training: Stories from Tomorrow's Physicians on April 29, 2016. The book is a compendium of 102 articles originally published on in-Training accompanied by discussion questions. in-Training published its 1000th article on September 18, 2016, representing 450 medical student authors at 152 medical schools in 19 countries. History The inception of in-Training began in April 2012 with a niche analysis of medical student publishing, which revealed an absence of peer-managed publications that were dedicated to the medical student community. Following the development of an editorial structure and peer- editing workflow, publication bylaws, ethical guidelines, and consultation with legal experts, the publication went live at in-training.org on July 2, 2012. In an interview with the Scientific American Incubator, founders Ajay Major and Aleena Paul explained their vision in founding in-Training: > \\"With in-Training, we recognized the need for a proper forum for medical > students to showcase their literary and artistic endeavors. in-Training > seeks to meet a dire need for a communal gathering place for medical > students. We are the agora of the medical student community, and as such, we > strive to publish innovative thought in the arts, politics, science, and > literature. We provide a virtual forum for medical students to participate > in the shared experience of being a physician-in-training and to learn from > the reflections and wisdom of their peers.\\" The publication was specifically founded as a peer-edited and peer-managed publication \\"by medical students and for medical students\\" in order to \\"provide medical students with a place to express themselves in a way that was unfiltered and uncensored.\\" In addition, the publication was founded upon several core principals, including no anonymous authors with all authors identified, an open-access publication without subscriptions, no advertisements, and no copyrighting of articles, with all copyrights retained by authors. One year after its founding in the summer of 2013, editors-in- chief Ajay Major and Aleena Paul retooled the publication as a magazine focused on publishing narratives and reflection articles, and also released a new mission statement for the publication that focused on in-Training as a virtual platform that facilitated self-reflection, community and collaboration among medical students on the global stage. Editor-in-chief and founder Ajay Major explained the rationale for this change in the in-Training mission in an interview: > \\"...when we went live, we got a huge onslaught of articles in the realm of > humanism in medicine: talking about the first day in gross dissection, the > first patient dying, or the stresses of having a family in medical school. > We found that we had built a publication that reached out to this medical > student audience that so desperately wanted to write.\\" It was at that time that in-Training gained its identify as an \\"organic\\" publication that would evolve over time to meeting the changing needs of the medical student community. With the publication of \\"A Lack of Care: Why Medical Students Should Focus on Ferguson\\" by a medical student at Alpert Medical School in December 2014, which was featured in a Stanford Medicine X talk in 2015 about the article's role in unifying the White Coats 4 Black Lives movement, in-Training began to evolve as a publication. Throughout 2015 to 2016, editors-in-chief Joseph Ladowski and Vikas Bhatt focused increasingly on publishing articles on social justice, politics, and health policy, including a series of articles on the Flint water crisis and controversy surrounding the USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills exam. In January 2015, in- Training launched the Writers-in-Training Program, a year-long intensive writing internship for medical students with one-on-one mentorship from the medical student editors. The internship has enrolled cohorts for 2015, 2016 and 2017.  Content  in-Training currently produces content in the following sections: opinion ('Opinion'), reflections from the preclinical years ('Preclinical'), news ('News'), patient stories and narratives from the clinical years ('From the Wards'), technology ('Tech'), interviews with physicians ('Doctor's Orders'), guest contributors ('Consults'). The magazine also publishes artistic works, including traditional and digital art, audio and video ('Off the Shelf'). The magazine identifies itself as an ‚Äúorganic\\" publication that changes over time to meet the needs of the medical student community. (sci am, wing of zock) As stated by the founders Ajay Major and Aleena Paul in their Scientific American Incubator interview: > At its inception, we embraced that in-Training would be an organic > publication that advanced with the changing perspectives and passions of the > medical student community. We imagine that the body of knowledge hosted on > in-Training represents a sort of ‚Äòinstitutional memory‚Äô of the medical > student community, a notion that requires us to be malleable and acutely > aware of the shifting needs of medical students. in-Training has published 40 columns written by medical students. in-Training has produced three podcast series which are syndicated on iTunes and is a founding member of The Vocalis Podcast Network, a network of podcasts for medical students. in-Training articles are also syndicated on Student Doctor Network. in-Training publishes an annual Mental Health Week issue, which first began in June 2015 and continued in 2016 and 2017.  Editorial Board and Workflow  in-Training is edited and managed entirely by an independent editorial board of over 40 volunteer, unpaid medical students. The publication is led by two editors-in-chief, who approve all content prior to publication. All articles published on in-Training undergo peer-review by at least two medical student editors prior to publication. The former and present editors- in-chief of in-Training are as follows: founders Ajay Major and Aleena Paul from Albany Medical College (2012-2016); Vikas Bhatt from Drexel University College of Medicine and Joseph Ladowski from Indiana University School of Medicine (2015-2017); and Andrew Kadlec at Medical College of Wisconsin and Ria Pal from University of Rochester Medical Center (2016‚Äìpresent).  in- Training: Stories from Tomorrow's Physicians  On April 29, 2016, in-Training published a book entitled in-Training: Stories from Tomorrow's Physicians, a print collection of 102 manuscripts originally published on in-Training since 2012. The book was marketed as ‚Äúa compendium of peer-edited narratives written by medical students on humanism, our real-life patients, and the challenges of being a physician-in-training.‚Äù The book was designed as a resource guide for medical students and educators interested in the medical humanities, with each manuscript being accompanied by discussion questions written by the medical student editors of in-Training. The collection was curated and edited by Ajay Major and Aleena Paul, the founders of in-Training. The book has been reviewed by The British Medical Journal, The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, Durham University Centre for Medical Humanities, Student Doctor Network, and Clinical Correlations: The NYU Langone Online Journal of Medicine.

Birth and family He was born on April 4, 1811, in Middlefield Center, Otsego County, New York. His family was of English heritage, traceable back to the 15th century and known in heraldry. Henry Peck came to America in 1637. Jesse Peck's grandfather, also named Jesse, died in Washington's army. Jesse Peck's father, Luther, was a blacksmith and lifelong class leader, whose five sons (of whom Jesse T. was the youngest) all became Methodist preachers. The trend in his family toward the Methodist ministry led his great-nephew, Stephen Crane, to say: \\"Upon my mother's side, everyone in my family became a Methodist clergyman as soon as they could walk, the ambling-nag, saddlebag, exhorting kind.\\"Robert Wooster Stallman, Stephen Crane, A Biography, 1973. Ordained ministry thumb Peck was converted to the Christian faith at the age of 16. He sensed a call to preach almost immediately. He entered the traveling ministry as a circuit rider of the Oneida Annual Conference of the M.E. Church in 1832. He was ordained by bishops Elijah Hedding and Beverly Waugh. Prior to his election to the episcopacy, Peck served as a pastor and a presiding elder. As a bishop, he was a delegate to the First Ecumenical Conference, 1881. Presidency at Dickinson In 1848, he was elected the tenth president of Dickinson College, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. During his presidency, Peck was unpopular with the students. In one student prank, he was detained in an insane asylum in Staunton, Virginia, where he had traveled for a church conference. Students locked Peck in a railroad boxcar overnight and another time, shot, and killed, his dog. On top of all of these problems with the students, Peck proved to be an inadequate fundraiser for the college; in June 1851, he announced his intention to leave the institution the following year, citing his belief that he was ill-suited to the tasks associated with the job.Peck at Dickinson . Accessed August 26, 2009. In July 1852, he gave the address to the graduating class, entitled God in Education.Jesse T. Peck, God in Education: An Address to the Graduating Class of 1852. Syracuse University Oakwood Cemetery, Syracuse, New York Though not a college graduate himself, Peck was prominent in the beginnings of Syracuse University, serving as the first chairman of its board of trustees. He developed what became, in effect, the university's first master plan: a scheme for the construction of seven buildings on land donated by George F. Comstock, also a member of the Board. Each building was to be dedicated to a different academic discipline. Peck's vision for the new campus was one of stylistic eclecticism; on one occasion declaring that the new university should \\"demonstrate the perfect harmony and indissoluble oneness of all that is valuable in the old and the new.\\" The first building completed under this plan was the Hall of Languages, built at the summit of University Avenue in Syracuse. Nationally renowned architect Horatio Nelson White was the designer of this French Second Empire structure. Peck died May 17, 1883, in Syracuse and is buried there in the Oakwood Cemetery.

According to Peter Milligan \\"Originally Bad Company had been devised as part of the Dredd mythos, featuring a Judge who had turned bad and been shipped off to a prison colony on Titan, one of Saturn's moons\\".Bad Company Book One, Titan books collection. Introduction by Peter Milligan Milligan, along with regular collaborators Brett Ewins and Jim McCarthy, dropped all aspects of the original concept, keeping only a team of new recruits facing an inhospitable planet and enemy. They first appeared in their self-titled strip in 2000 AD prog 500 (December 13, 1986). Plot Humanity is at war with a strange alien species known as the Krool. Young soldier Danny Franks is fighting on the planet Ararat, recruited by the renegades known as Bad Company after the destruction of his own platoon. As their name might suggest this is no ordinary group of soldiers; instead they are a collection of freaks and maniacs led by Kano, a Frankenstein's Monster-like character with a secret kept in a little box. =The Krool= The Krool are an alien species that serve as the main foe in Bad Company. They are led by a being known as the \\"Krool Heart\\" on the unnamed Krool Home Planet. The \\"Krool Heart\\" controls the Krool race via its vast psychic mind. Whatever the heart thinks, the mind will obey. The Krool have the technology to create \\"War Zombies\\", hybrids and other such monstrosities. Due to their sadistic behaviour, they have also created machines to extract the \\"soul\\" out of their human prisoners. They have also been known to employ sadistic brainwashed human captives as guards. The Krool were ultimately responsible for creating Bad Company and their leader when they took half a human brain and inserted it into a Krool and vice versa thus creating the Krool-hybrid. In conversation between Mad Tommy and Danny Franks Tommy explains that the Krool have reached their evolutionary limit, while Humanity (specifically the two races' brains) are only using a fraction of their potential. This leads the Krool hybrid to lapse into insanity while Kano's human brain assumes dominance over the implanted Krool half-brain. =The Ararat War= The Ararat War was a war waged against Humanity. The Krool wanted to capture Ararat to add to their already extensive empire whereas the Earth elite needed it to evacuate to as Earth was on the verge of being destroyed by ecological catastrophe. They employed their \\"War Zombies\\" to attack the front line's defences. They finished off the survivors personally. Officially, the war ended when Ararat exploded but unofficially, the war continued on the Ghetto Planets, led by the remnants of Humanity who had survived the destruction of Earth. =Aftermath of the war= The second incarnation of Bad Company, now led by Danny Franks & consisting of the last Protoid (an alien shapeshifter) in existence, Sheeva a \\"Boom Baby\\", (genetically enhanced, and with the ability \\"...to make atoms dance...\\",) De Racine, one of the \\"Earth Elite\\" and a masochist called Rackman, track down a monster terrorizing the Ghetto Planets whilst looking for Kano, unaware that the two are one and the same. After finding and recruiting Kano, they use Protoids chameleon ship to head to the Krool Homeworld undetected in order to destroy the Krool once and for all. Sheeva, Rackman, De Racine and Protoid are killed, but the alien is revealed to have been a puppet of the true Protoid ‚Äì the chameleon ship ‚Äì who is trying to merge and replace the new Krool Heart. Instead, Danny takes the place of the Krool Heart, and Protoid is defeated. Afterwards, Danny/The Krool Heart allows the survivors and prisoners to leave the planet promising to make the Krool more passive, it being revealed that the sadistic excesses of the Krool had been due to the corruption and decadence of the old Krool Heart. A few years later, Kano returns to the Krool Homeworld with a further incarnation of Bad Company. After a long battle, Kano and Bad Company managed to free Danny. As they leave, Kano elects to stay to continue fighting the Krool. Characters *Danny Franks ‚Äì a naive young soldier whose story we follow as he gets broken and broken in.

During his last Buzz Out Loud episode on May 14, 2010 he announced that his main focus at TWiT.tv would be a new daily show, Tech News Today. = TWiT Network = Prior to joining TWiT as an employee, Merritt had a long- standing working relationship with former TechTV colleague Leo Laporte's network having regularly appeared on This Week in Tech as either a guest or as a relief host. His independent general discussion podcast with Roger Chang, East Meets West, also featured on TWiT Live. Tech News Today launched on June 1, 2010.

Merritt still appeared on the Frogpants Network for a segment called Tom's Tech Time on Wednesdays on the Scott Johnson/Brian Ibbott-hosted podcast The Morning Stream. On November 10, 2010, Merritt officially launched his second new show on TWiT, FrameRate. Focusing on video in its many and varied forms (television, film, internet), Merritt co-hosted the show with magician and NSFW podcast host Brian Brushwood. On January 20, 2011, TWiT officially launched Triangulation, a new show Merritt co-hosting with Leo Laporte and interviewing a notable figure in technology. In July 2012 he stopped hosting the show because he \\"wanted to work on other projects.\\" In addition to these regular shows, Merritt hosted live breaking news coverage of major technology events on TWiT Live such as WWDC, Google I/O, and the resignation and passing of Steve Jobs. These are later released as \\"TWiT Live Specials\\" podcasts. He has acted as a relief host for Laporte on TWiT, Windows Weekly, Security Now and other shows when Laporte has been unavailable. On October 22, 2012, Merritt announced that he would be moving to Los Angeles to accommodate his wife's new employment at YouTube, but would still continue to present on the TWiT network over Skype. On December 5, 2013, Leo Laporte announced that Merritt's contract would not be renewed, stating that the decision was based on the need for an in-studio anchor for Tech News Today. Merritt hosted his last edition on December 30, 2013. =Freelance Podcasts= Since February 4, 2008, Merritt has hosted Sword & Laser, a sci-fi and fantasy book club podcast, co-hosted with his former CNET colleague, Veronica Belmont.http://www.swordandlaser.com On June 22, 2010, he launched a new show for Tom's Top 5, originally for Revision3, the show counted down a new Top 5 list every week released on Tuesday until November 1, 2011. He then did a similar show \\"CNET Top 5\\" and now for TechRepublic (part of CNET). Merritt appeared in two early episodes of his Frame Rate co-host Brian Brushwood's Revision3 show Scam School. On March 3, 2013, Merritt and Molly Wood began the It's a Thing podcast described on the as \\"It‚Äôs a Thing is a show grown from the brain of Molly Wood, derived from a regular segment on the CNET podcast Gadgettes. Tom and Molly started the hit podcast ‚ÄúBuzz Out Loud‚Äù which they co-hosted for years after the turn of the century. They missed doing shows together, so they decided that in itself, should become a thing. Again.\\" In early January 2014, following his departure from TWiT, Merritt began co-hosting a podcast with Brian Brushwood called Cordkillers,http://www.cordkillers.com/blog/2014/1/6/cordkillers- ep-1-distributors-gotta-distribute while also starting a new podcast Daily Tech News Show (DTNS).http://www.dailytechnewsshow.com/dtns-2140-my-car-has- lasers/ His main projects currently are Daily Tech News Show, Cordkillers, Sword and Laser, CurrentGeek! and It‚Äôs a Thing. = Books = Merritt has written several books, mostly sci-fi novels, including Boiling Point. which he later narrated it as an audiobook. this describes a near future United States civil war and United Moon Colonies in 2006, of which he posted chapters on his blog. Both of these were published on Lulu.com with a Creative Commons license. =Foxconn= In 2012, newspapers reported calls by consumer groups to boycott Apple products in response to accounts of worker suicides and dangerous working conditions at the Foxconn plant in China. Merritt, who has followed tech news since 2005, responded by saying \\"Boycotts of Apple might be good to nudge Apple into doing something to improve conditions, but, you're going to have to boycott buying electronics if you really wanted to punish China. I'm not sure that that's called for, necessarily.\\" Citing a Forbes infographic showing Foxconn with, reportedly, fewer suicides per million workers (18) than the number of suicides per million Chinese citizens (220), Merritt suggested it might be worth investigating whether the lower rate at Foxconn may be due to \\"the fact that people who are gainfully employed are in some way less likely to commit suicide.\\" There may be other reasons besides the working conditions at the plant for worker suicides. Instead of boycotts, he advocated addressing the dangerous working conditions in a broader context. Comparing the conditions at Foxconn to coal mines of the 1800s and early 1900s, he added, \\"There may be similar types of abuses going on at Foxconn, but we have those kinds of conditions arise because the conditions that the workers are in before they take the job are worse. That doesn't excuse the conditions, but you don't just want to get rid of the factory. You don't want to just get rid of the coal mine and send people back into abject poverty. What you want to do is put pressure on the coal mine or the factory or whatever to begin to change their ways and improve those conditions so that everybody wins.\\" Bibliography * Pilot-X 2017 * Boiling Point (Revised Edition) 1997 * United Moon Colonies: Chronicles of the Clone Incident 2007 * Chronology of Tech History 2012 * Lot Beta 2013 * Citadel 32: A Tale of the Aggregate 2015 References External links *Tech News Today on the TWiT Network *Tom Merritt.com *SubBrilliant News *East Meets West Podcast with Roger Chang *the Sword & Laser Podcast with Veronica Belmont * the Current Geek & Current Geek Weekly Podcast with Scott Johnson * the FourCast Podcast with Scott Johnson The Real Deal column *The Real Deal podcast CNET 1970 births Living people American men podcasters American podcasters TechTV people 21st-century American businesspeople People from Marin County, California People from Greenville, Illinois TWiT.tv people Technology commentators ","title":"Tom Merritt"},{"id":"4038570","text":"Krasnooktyabrsky (masculine), Krasnooktyabrskaya (feminine), or Krasnooktyabrskoye (neuter) may refer to: *Krasnooktyabrsky District, several districts and city districts in Russia *Krasnooktyabrsky Urban Settlement, a municipal formation which the Urban-Type Settlement of Krasnooktyabrsky in Medvedevsky District of the Mari El Republic, Russia is incorporated as *Krasnooktyabrskoye Urban Settlement, a municipal formation which the work settlement of Krasny Oktyabr in Saratovsky District of Saratov Oblast, Russia is incorporated as *Krasnooktyabrsky, Russia (Krasnooktyabrskaya, Krasnooktyabrskoye), several inhabited localities in Russia *Krasnooktyabrsky, former name of the town of Shopokov in Kyrgyzstan ","title":"Krasnooktyabrsky"},{"id":"4038575","text":"William Kilgour \\"Willie\\" Jackson (14 March 1871 in Lamington, South Lanarkshire ‚Äì 26 January 1955 in Symington) was a Scottish curler.

The majority of the neighborhood falls within the 19141 zip code, but some of it falls within 19140 (Hunting Park ZIP Code). The neighborhood is sometimes confused with the Olney neighborhood of Philadelphia. Olney Avenue extends from both the Olney and Logan neighborhoods of the city. The Olney Transportation Center is located in Logan. History The area was once part of the plantation of James Logan, adviser to William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. Modern transportation formed the community: the Broad Street subway, which opened in 1928, and a thriving network of streetcar and bus routes, allowed development of what was then considered one of the earliest suburban communities in Philadelphia, though the area is considered urban today. The transportation network still provides Logan residents easy access to the rest of the city. Logan had been a predominantly Jewish neighborhood until the 1970s. 11th Street was a center of commerce with two bakeries, a deli, and a dairy store. Broad Street had three movie theaters. In the 1970s, Korean people began moving into Logan and established businesses. By the mid-1980s Koreans began moving out of Logan and into sections such as Olney in Philadelphia, and nearby suburbs such as Cheltenham as the area began to gentrify, as African- Americans and Hispanics, which accompanied the migration of Koreans into the neighborhood from the previous decade, began to populate the area, as Koreans began to migrate out of the Logan section and into the nearby suburbs further from Philadelphia.Kaufman, Marc. \\"'Koreatown': From Logan Into Olney.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer.

The Centrepoint is a shopping mall in Singapore which opened in 1983 as Centrepoint Shopping Centre (or just Centrepoint) until its renaming in 2006 as The Centrepoint.  History  The Centrepoint is managed by Frasers Property, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Fraser & Neave. It was built in 1983. Throughout the decades, the eight-storey complex was home to many different tenants, including Teochew City Seafood Restaurant, Cold Storage, Marks and Spencer, TianPo Jewellery, and Metro. The mall, which has six storeys and two basement levels, opened with Robinsons as the anchor tenant. It had been replaced by Metro in 2015, out of which it will be closing down on 15 September 2019. Centrepoint is undergoing third renovation works and is expected to complete by 2020 with more tenants such as Decathlon, Ichiran Ramen, Ichiban Boshi, Itacho Sushi, MOF My Izakaya, iSTEAKS, Haidilao Hotpot, Xiaomi and Tokyu Hands. The shopping mall underwent a makeover in 1991 and the first cost $4 million. The Centrepoint's management committee at the time carried out a survey to find out what customers wanted, and top on the wish list was better toilets. The toilets were fitted with automatic flushing systems and renovation works were carried out at night. Times Bookstores is also the biggest bookstores in the Orchard Road, of which it opened in 1983. It underwent a revamp in 2002, expanding across three floors but ended up downsized again. In 2005, Frasers Centrepoint refurbished the mall for the second time. The revamp included a six-storey extension with two basements which was previously a sidewalk. The second basement to the third floor would be for food and beverage outlets and shops, and the fourth to sixth floors would be an extension of the former Robinsons. The renovation works were completed in December 2006, and there is now a Gap store on the second floor and an Esprit store on the third floor. There was a shopping mall decentralisation strategy over the years. There are plans to transform Orchard Road into a megamall that is connected by a network of linked walkways. Part of this plan is a link bridge between The Centrepoint and Orchard Point. The Straits Times reported that this second major makeover included the widening of its Orchard Road entrance and a new drop-off and pick-up point on level one to make it easier for families with children and the elderly. Apart from this, many of the tenants had begun to leave ‚Äì Marks & Spencer was replaced by Ministry of Food (MOF). A fire broke out at a shoe shop at 10.30 am on 16 February 2019.

The Center is owned and operated by the Rensselaer Newman Foundation (RNF). It is conventionally referred to as \\"The C+CC\\"; the \\"+\\" sign has come to be formally used instead of \\"and\\" or an ampersand as a representative symbol of the Christian cross. While located on the campus of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) , the C+CC is managed and operated as an independent organizational entity. The C+CC provides a home to the Roman Catholic University Parish of Christ Sun of Justice, and its staff members provide administrative support to Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Muslim chaplaincy services at RPI. Early history The Roman Catholic Church at RPI began as a Newman Association with a faculty advisor in 1907. (\\"Newman Associations\\" and \\"Newman Centers\\" are often used to designate Catholic campus ministry centers at state and other non-Catholic universities; they take their names from Cardinal Newman). In 1914, a part-time chaplain was assigned to RPI by the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany. In 1936, Monsignor William M. Slavin was appointed as the first Resident Catholic Chaplain at RPI, serving the entire campus community. He was succeeded in that position by Reverend Thomas W. Phelan in 1959. In the early 1960s, the issue of a permanent home became more pressing when the chapel of the Convent of the Good Shepherd was sold to RPI, leaving the Catholic community without a regular worship space. A petition was filed with the State of New York to incorporate a nonprofit organization to support fundraising for and operation of an independent facility. On November 22, 1963, the Regents of the University of the State of the New York chartered the Rensselaer Newman Foundation (RNF) as an educational corporation. The RNF's founding trustees were Martin F. Davis, William A. Kerrigan, John I. Millet (Board President), Monsignor William M. Slavin and Reverend Thomas W. Phelan. The purposes of the corporation as stated on its charter were: a. To establish and maintain non-degree courses in theology, philosophy and related subjects; b. To foster and provide extracurricular programs for Catholic Students attending Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; c. To foster and provide scholarships, fellowships and other student aids; and d. To foster and develop the intellectual and moral life of Catholic students through religious education, cultural activity and social participation. In 1965 and 1966, the RNF trustees began researching and acquiring land to build a dedicated facility, eventually settling on a series of parcels on Burdett Avenue between Peoples Avenue and Sherry Road in Troy. On December 6, 1966, the RNF Board of Trustees passed a resolution directing its Building Committee, chaired by Stephen E. Wiberley, to develop a final plan for the C+CC. By February 1967, the C+CC design was completed by the architectural firm of Levatich and Miller from Ithaca, New York. In June 1967, Board President John I. Millet signed a construction contract with Corina Construction Company to build the C+CC. The facility opened with a two-week dedication festival in October and November 1968. In September 1970, the University Parish of Christ Sun of Justice was chartered by canonical decree of the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany. Reverend Thomas W. Phelan was the parish's first pastor, and served in that capacity until 2001, when he was relieved by Reverend Edward S. Kacerguis. (Reverend Phelan also served as RPI's Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences through much of his tenure as pastor). A total of eleven additional Catholic priests have been assigned to the C+CC since Phelan's service began in 1959, as well as six female Resident Catholic Chaplains, and nine non-clerical Directors. The C+CC Building A view of the building from the southeast. The C+CC was conceived and designed as a functional multi-purpose facility, drawing together the sacred and the secular, religious services and performing arts, educational and social events. By February 1969, nine national and international publications had written major feature articles on the C+CC (including a cover story in The New York Times), praising its unique mixture of utilitarian simplicity (it is an unfinished block building) and functional flexibility. It received the highest award then given for religious buildings by the Liturgical Conference. A book specifically about the C+CC, Community on Campus (edited by Myron B. Bloy, Jr.) was published in 1971, arguing that the distinct multi-purpose model created by the RNF's founding trustees marked a major milestone in the development of the contemporary Catholic Church in America by fully embracing the Second Vatican Council's liberalization of the liturgy and the role of the Church in the secular world. The C+CC features a main auditorium that can seat up to 450 people, with movable risers and chairs allowing a variety of configurations for various events. An altar chapel may be connected to or separated from the auditorium via sliding wooden doors. Ade Bethune designed the altar chapel and main auditorium's liturgical features, including the stained glass oculus in the east wall. Father Edward Catich wrote the giant Greek, Roman and Hebrew alphabets painted on the main auditorium's floor. Next to the Bethune oculus hangs a massive fragment of the \\"Spoil Bank Crucifix\\" carved by Eric Gill and acquired from the Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic, Sussex, England. The C+CC's permanent collection also includes works by Pablo Picasso, Tomie dePaola, George Nakashima, Edgar Holloway, Larry Kagan and numerous other contemporary artists, as well as a collection of antique sculpture and liturgical pieces. A hallway art gallery, lounge and conference room provide space for curated fine art exhibitions and community meetings. A connected rectory provides housing for parish priests and staff; the rectory was named \\"Slavin House\\" in honor of Monsignor Slavin. In 1994, a capital campaign was begun to fund building and grounds improvements at the C+CC, and to bring the facility fully into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In October 2003, 19th Street between Sherry Road and Peoples Avenue in Troy was renamed \\"Tom Phelan Place\\" in recognition of the RNF/C+CC founder's service to the local community. Reverend Phelan died in April 2006 shortly before his 81st birthday. His Liturgy of Christian Burial was held at the C+CC. In 2011 the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

History =1993‚Äì1998= The band formed in early 1993, with Wally Schwartz on bass. Their first release, the \\"Criminal Boy\\" 7\\", came in the same year, on Silly Moo Records. In short order Rene Dullum took over the duties on bass. They continued to release 7\\"s and EPs, drawing attention for this and for their rapid release schedule, until they recorded their debut full-length in 1995, titled Action Pants!, released on No Life Records. This release was not without its problems. Dullum was fired from the band before the album was released, taking her songs with her. This meant that the album's running time was rather short ‚Äì now being only 8 songs long, and around 20 minutes in length (partly due to the 10-minute-long \\"Open Wide and Say Oblina\\", the album's closer). The band then recruited bassist Jen Wolfe, and continued to release 7\\"s, including The Bunnygrunt Family Notebook, and Blue Christmas (a Christmas 7\\", with their cover of the holiday standard on the one side, and an original, 'Season's Freaklings', on the other). In 1998, they released their second album, Jen-Fi, again on No Life. This had double the tracks of their first album, although the running time was again very brief, as few songs broke the 2 minute mark. The album attracted favourable reviews, yet the band disappeared soon after this, with little fanfare. Matt and Karen went on to form The See-Thrus. Later still Matt joined The Julia Sets and Karen formed The Fantasy Four. =2003‚Äìpresent= In 2003, the earlier-recorded Bunnygrunt song 'Season's Freaklings' (also previously featured on a compilation entitled Better Than Fruitcake which was a forerunner to the Bert Dax Christmas compilations‚Äîsee below) was used on the soundtrack to the Billy Bob Thornton movie, Bad Santa, enhancing the band's popularity. In the fall of 2004, a new collection of Bunnygrunt's old tracks and rarities, entitled In the Valley of Lonesome Phil, was released on Harnish's own label, \\"The Bert Dax Cavalcade of Stars\\". Ried had been playing with various local musicians as The Fantasy Four, and Harnish was busy at various pf local artists playing original and traditional holiday songs every Christmas season), playing bass for the St. Louis-based Julia Sets (who had a split EP with theoints since Bunnygrunt's secession into relative non-existence around 1998 with running his Bert Dax label (which releases, among other things, a compilation o Fantasy Four on the Bert Dax label in 2001), and working at popular local record store Vintage Vinyl. The band played a house party with Lauren Trull on bass to celebrate the release of Bad Santa and decided to reform full-time, playing the Athens PopFest (to which they have returned as recently as August 2010, and at which they are one of only three acts to appear every single year since its inception, alongside Cars Can Be Blue and Casper & the Cookies) later that year. The band released their latest album, Karen Haters Club, on Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records, in the fall of 2005. Trull has since left the band, and Ried and Harnish now continue officially as a two-piece, with Eric Von Damage (formerly of Corbeta Corbata and The Adversary Workers) on drums, though a set arsenal of regular guests with whom they play live shows and record has been established, including Jason Hutto of Walkie Talkie U.S.A. and Phonocaptors fame, Mario Viele of the Pubes and Sex Robots, as well as Erik Seaver of the Museum Mutters, Parker's Back, Lost to Metric, and the Five Deadly Venoms. At the 2007 Athens Popfest, Bunnygrunt was joined onstage by the horn section of HHBTM label-mates Red Pony Clock for a cover of Carmelita by Warren Zevon. At the 2010 Athens Popfest, Bunnygrunt was joined onstage by several friends for a cover of Red Pony Clock's \\"Don't Forget Who Your Friends Are.\\" In 2009, the band released a new full length on HHBTM entitled Matt Harnish and Other Delights. Pancake Productions released two Bunnygrunt 7\\" records, \\"Lady, You Just Got Von Damaged\\" in 2010 and \\"The Worst Of Both Worlds\\" (a split with The Winchester and with Throwing Things Records) in 2012. The title of \\"...Von Damaged\\" is in keeping with their tradition of naming records after members of the band, Eric Von Damage having been Bunnygrunt's drummer for the majority of years since their reunion. The cover of the record is an embroidery painting of Von Damage lounging in a chair with a bulldog nearby and a macaw on his shoulder. Bunnygrunt's sixth (or fifth, depending on how you are counting) album Vol. 4 was released in July 2015 on HHBTM. The cassette and CD versions featured bonus tracks from singles and other records released since (and even before) their previous album, including the two Pancake Productions 45s and the WeePOP! EP. =Tribute album= In late August 2013, Pancake Productions released You Wanna Be Just Like Bunnygrunt: A Loving Tribute To The First 21¬Ω Years. It features 26 covers of Bunnygrunt songs from all eras of the band by label-mates, friends, and a variety of acts from around the globe, including members of longtime tour partners Tullycraft and Darling Little Jackhammer as well as other bands containing former members such as The Sex Robots and Jason Hutto, and other friends including The Ottomen, Red Pony Clock, Casper & The Cookies, and Googolplexia. Style During their original lifespan, Bunnygrunt's sound changed only marginally, being centred on a sound that was primarily labelled as twee pop or cuddlecore, which led to Allmusic naming them 'The World's Cutest Band'.[] While the accuracy of this label is open to dispute, it is clear that the band themselves were not happy with being presented in this way, or indeed even being classified as 'twee', due to the connotations associated with such a label (deliberately sloppy instrumentalism, overly 'cutesy' presentation). Indeed, Harnish noted that he \\"hated\\" the label, and this aspect of twee music. However, the band's position as twee was only solidified when their first major show after their 2004 reformation took place at the Athens PopFest, a music festival organised by noted twee label Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records, who also released Karen Haters Club. The style of music prevalent on this album, however, is not exactly what one might call twee pop, the band creating a far heavier sound, more akin to simple punk rock. However, the band's twee label persists, though mainly by association. Lyrics Bunnygrunt's lyrics cover a wide range of material, but are not often particularly serious, as song titles such as \\"I Mock You With My Monkey Pants\\", \\"I Dated a Zombie\\", and \\"I Just Had Broken Heart Surgery, Love Won't Bypass Me Again\\" attest. At times, their lyrics have taken on leanings towards the satirical, for example, \\"Superstar 666\\" from Action Pants!, which features Ried satirically proclaiming herself to be a celebrity, a theme which continues in several Bunnygrunt songs.

He served as the longest running president (20 years) of the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) from 1941 to 1961. Deramus led the Kansas City Southern Railway through the Great Depression by encouraging industry to locate on the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas. He helped the railway avoid bankruptcy in the 1930s and refinanced $67 million in bonded debt that fell due in the late 1940s. Deramus' formal education ended with 8th grade. Before he was 14, he eagerly agreed to tend the switch lamps, and keep the station in order for $4 a month ‚Äî plus an opportunity to become proficient in weaving those mysterious clicks into words so powerful they moved the trains for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N;). Within a year, Deramus began pounding a key as relief operator. He learned his profession, and the detail of railroading, fast and moved on to better positions. From the L&N; he went to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL), then to the Southern Railway (SOU), where, at 20, he was a dispatcher at Memphis, Tennessee. His chief at Memphis resigned to accept a job with the Kansas City Southern Railway at Pittsburg, Kansas. Pleased with the prospects there, the chief wrote his prot√©g√© of the opportunities with the new road ‚Äî and opportunities were all Deramus needed. On November 9, 1909, the name of W. N. Deramus first appeared on a KCS payroll. From telegraph operator he advanced to dispatcher, then chief dispatcher. Next, he was superintendent of car service, then superintendent of the Southern Division. He was elected general manager, then vice-president and general manager, executive vice-president, and then to president of the railway in 1941. In 1945 he was elected president and chairman of the board. He spent almost half his time out on the railway. It is said that he knew the 1,647 miles of track between Kansas City and the Gulf of Mexico so well he could tell where he was by the sound of the wheels on the rails. Under the impetus he provided the Kansas City Southern, its net income was twice the industry average. Deramus was a major figure in Kansas City's civic life. In 1957, the Deramus family donated the Deramus Field Station to MRIGlobal to support the organization's growing contract research business.

It is a founding member of the Annunciation Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. History Interior of the church of Maredsous Abbey Maredsous Abbey was founded on 15 November 1872 by Beuron Abbey in Germany, the founder of many religious houses, at the instigation of Hildebrand de Hemptinne, a Belgian monk at Beuron and later abbot of Maredsous. The foundation was supported financially by the Descl√©e family, who paid for the design and construction of the spectacular buildings, which are the masterwork of the architect Jean-Baptiste de B√©thune (1831-1894), leader of the neo-gothic style in Belgium. The overall plan is based on the 13th century Cistercian abbey of Villers at Villers-la-Ville in Walloon Brabant. The frescos however were undertaken by the art school of the mother-house at Beuron, much against the will of B√©thune and Descl√©e, who dismissed the Beuron style as \\"Assyrian-Bavarian\\". Construction was finished in 1892. = Abbots = # 1872-1874 : Jean Blessing, Sup√©rior # 1874-1876 : Placide Wolter, Prior # 1877-1878 : G√©rard van Caloen, Prior # 1878-1890 : Placide Wolter, Abbot # 1890-1909 : Hildebrand de Hemptinne, Abbot # 1909-1923 : Blessed Columba Marmion, Abbot - buried in the abbey church # 1923-1950 : C√©lestin Golenvaux, Abbot # 1950-1968 : Godefroid Dayez, Abbot # 1968-1969 : Olivier du Roy, Prior # 1969-1972 : Olivier du Roy, Abbot # 1972-1978 : Nicolas Dayez, Prior # 1978-2002 : Nicolas Dayez, Abbot # 2002-current: Bernard Lorent, Abbot Work =Foundations= Maredsous has either founded, or has been instrumental in the foundation of, a number of other Benedictine houses: St Anselm in Rome (1893); abbeys in Brazil (1895); St. Andrew's Abbey, Zevenkerken, Bruges (1899); Keizersberg Abbey in Leuven (1899); Glenstal Abbey in Ireland (1927); Gihindamuyaga in Rwanda (1958); Qu√©vy Abbey in Hainaut (1969). =School of art= The idea of an art school, inspired by that at the mother house, led to the foundation of the School of Applied Arts and Crafts, also known as the St. Joseph School. There was a difference of opinion as to whether it should serve more as a place for training poor children as carpenters, blacksmiths, plumbers and cobblers, or whether it should function more as a centre of fine arts and crafts. It was the latter view that prevailed when the school opened in 1903 under the leadership of Father Pascal Rox, and in due course the production began of neo-gothic works of high quality (vestments, pieces of silver, bindings and so on) destined mostly for the abbey itself. The school's activities were curtailed by World War I and it was almost closed down in 1919, but it survived by widening its remit to undertaking paid work in a more modern style for outside customers. From 1939 onwards, the emphasis changed more explicitly towards the training of artists rather than skilled craftsmen. In 1964, after establishing an international reputation, the school merged with the Namur School of Crafts to form the I.A.T.A. (Technical Institute of Arts and Crafts).

This alkali metal halide is composed of rubidium and chlorine, and finds diverse uses ranging from electrochemistry to molecular biology. Structure In its gas phase, RbCl is diatomic with a bond length estimated at 2.7868 √Ö. This distance increases to 3.285 √Ö for cubic RbCl, reflecting the higher coordination number of the ions in the solid phase. Depending on conditions, solid RbCl exists in one of three arrangements or polymorphs as determined with holographic imaging: =Sodium chloride (octahedral 6:6)= The sodium chloride (NaCl) polymorph is most common. A cubic close-packed arrangement of chloride anions with rubidium cations filling the octahedral holes describes this polymorph. Both ions are six-coordinate in this arrangement. This polymorph's lattice energy is only 3.2 kJ/mol less than the following structure's. =Caesium chloride (cubic 8:8)= At high temperature and pressure, RbCl adopts the caesium chloride (CsCl) structure (NaCl and KCl undergo the same structural change at high pressures). Here, the chloride ions form a simple cubic arrangement with chloride anions occupying the vertices of a cube surrounding a central Rb+. This is RbCl's densest packing motif. Because a cube has eight vertices, both ions' coordination numbers equal eight. This is RbCl's highest possible coordination number. Therefore, according to the radius ratio rule, cations in this polymorph will reach their largest apparent radius because the anion-cation distances are greatest. =Sphalerite (tetrahedral 4:4)= The sphalerite polymorph of rubidium chloride has not been observed experimentally. This is consistent with the theory; the lattice energy is predicted to be nearly 40.0 kJ/mol smaller in magnitude than those of the preceding structures. Synthesis The most common preparation of pure rubidium chloride involves the reaction of its hydroxide with hydrochloric acid, followed by recrystallization: :RbOH(aq) \\\\+ HCl(aq) ‚Üí RbCl(aq) \\\\+ H2O(l) Because RbCl is hygroscopic, it must be protected from atmospheric moisture, e.g. using a desiccator. RbCl is primarily used in laboratories. Therefore, numerous suppliers (see below) produce it in smaller quantities as needed. It is offered in a variety of forms for chemical and biomedical research. Reactions Rubidium chloride reacts with sulfuric acid to rubidium hydrogen sulfate. Radioactivity Every 18 mg of rubidium chloride is equivalent to approximately one banana equivalent dose due to the large fraction (27.8%) of naturally-occurring radioactive isotope rubidium-87. Uses *Rubidium chloride is used as a gasoline additive to improve its octane number. *Rubidium chloride has been shown to modify coupling between circadian oscillators via reduced photaic input to the suprachiasmatic nuclei. The outcome is a more equalized circadian rhythm, even for stressed organisms. *Rubidium chloride is an excellent non-invasive biomarker. The compound dissolves well in water and can readily be taken up by organisms. Once broken in the body, Rb+ replaces K+ in tissues because they are from the same chemical group. An example of this is the use of a radioactive isotope to evaluate perfusion of heart muscle. *Rubidium chloride transformation for competent cells is arguably the compound's most abundant use. Cells treated with a hypotonic solution containing RbCl expand. As a result, the expulsion of membrane proteins allows negatively charged DNA to bind. *Rubidium chloride has shown antidepressant effects in experimental human studies, in doses ranging from 180 to 720 mg. It purportedly works by elevating dopamine and norepinephrine levels, resulting in a stimulating effect, which would be useful for anergic and apathetic depression.

Since 1991, he has lived in the United States and creates in his Manhattan studio in New York City. He has been called the \\"Russian Rousseau\\". Over the last forty years Gorbachev‚Äôs career has reached the highest level of international art. Yuri Gorbachev created his own unique technique of painting on canvas, using non-ferrous metals (gold, bronze), special varnishes and enamels, completely removing black from the palette. Biography Yuri Gorbachev's work is now represented in more than twenty museums worldwide including the permanent collections of The Russian National Museum, St. Petersburg, the Louvre, the Kremlin Museum, The National Museum, the Tsarskoye Selo, Palace of Alexander the Third, National Armenian Gallery, Martiros Saryan Museum, Yerevan, The Rudana Museum, Bali, The United Nations, The White House, the National Fine Art Museum of the Ukraine, the Moscow Museum of Modern Art and the Russian Museum of Kiev. Since his arrival in the United States Yuri Gorbachev has exhibited his work in more than two hundred and fifty one man shows worldwide. Former Christie‚Äôs Auction House expert in Russian art, Maria Paphiti, calls Yuri Gorbachev the ambassador of Russia for world art. For the past twenty years Gorbachev has traveled extensively; his artistic development moved from his naive style to his most recent intricate works. He uses a sophisticated technique with precious metals like gold and copper along with specially formulated lacquers over oil on canvas; he never uses black in his palette, leading art critics to call his style ‚ÄúPositivism‚Äù. In the last two years, he has developed a new technique, which highlights his paintings with enamel creating added texture and luster to his composition. The complex technique developed over two decades, using ceramic techniques on canvas is unique and inimitable. Mr. Gorbachev‚Äôs work is represented in the personal collection of President William Jefferson Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; his painting was personally presented in Washington on July 22, 1996. In 2011, Yuri Gorbachev was commissioned to design a new label for Stolichnaya Red Vodka, The label he created ‚ÄúFour Elements, by Yuri Gorbachev‚Äù was based on his painting of the same name. It is destined to become a collector‚Äôs item and new icon for the brand. This is not the first time Yuri Gorbachev has worked with Stolichnaya. In 1994, ‚ÄúStolichnaya‚Äù commissioned Gorbachev to design their annual Christmas ‚ÄúHoliday‚Äù advertisement, which appeared in hundreds of magazines around the world including Art & Antiques, Vanity Fair, Vogue, Time, American Photo, W, GQ, Elle among others. It was so successful that every year for the next four years he was commissioned to do a new image for the Holiday ad. Michel Roux, art collector and President of Carillon Importers, Inc. (distributor of Absolut and Stolichnaya vodka) was the person behind the creative advertising of Stolichnaya and Absolut. He used artists including Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Yuri Gorbachev for the famous Absolut Vodka ad campaigns, creating a tradition of using famous artists for vodka advertisements to promote the brands with cultural icons. Roux described Yuri Gorbachev as ‚Äú‚Ä¶the Angel from Russia. He brings out whatever is good from there. The spirit, the subject matter, and the colors of his work-profound in their simplicity-exemplify what Russia is all about.‚Äù Americans of culture recognize Russia through his art. His energy and enthusiasm for Russia and the Ukraine, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in the USSR before moving to New York, are expressed in his work and help viewers understand emotionally and intellectually the culture which fostered his great energy and talent. Gorbachev began his career as a Russian ceramics artist making sculptures, bas-reliefs and painting on ceramic plaques, which are displayed in many Fine Art Museums and galleries around the world. He arrived in the United States from the former USSR in 1991 with little knowledge of the English language but with an abundance of his great talent and charisma. Famous for his fine art ceramics for twenty years in the USSR he dared to change his medium to oil on canvas. The result was a spectacular success. In 1993 Gorbachev‚Äôs first visit to the Far East showed him his true path as a painter ‚Äì his connection to the Orient was immediate and dynamic and influenced both his style and technique. He brought these influences back to the rest of the world through his paintings. Gorbachev incorporated these different worlds and experiences‚Äì Russian, American, and Asian, into his art, and changed and developed into the unique artist he is today. On March 14, 1996, the United Nations honored Yuri Gorbachev with a commission to create an original work in conjunction with the release of the United Nations stamp ‚ÄúEndangered Species.‚Äù Secretary General Boutros Boutros- Ghali received Gorbachev‚Äôs rendition of Green Parrot On Red Flower at a preview exhibition. Yuri Gorbachev was classically trained in Soviet art academies and also acquired advanced degrees in philosophy and communication. His most notable accomplishment through his art has been his success in bringing many different cultures together in his own simple language of beauty. His use of lacquer and glazing techniques in his paintings exhibit his classic training and mastery of ceramics. Gorbachev‚Äôs artistic career has flourished in New York City and he has had solo exhibits all over the United States and Europe. Recognizing Gorbachev‚Äôs great talent and influence as an artist not only in the United States, but worldwide, Rizzoli International, published ‚ÄúThe Art of Yuri Gorbachev‚Äù in 1998. It presents 100 full-color plates divided into thematic sections spanning Gorbachev‚Äôs career. He is only one of a few Russian artists ever to have had Rizzoli publish their books; Chagall and Malevich are in this small group. In 2000, The Bertelsmann Group, published ‚ÄúThe Art of Paradise‚Äù, a major book about Yuri Gorbachev‚Äôs life and art explaining his symbolism, roots and development as an artist and containing his ceramics from the first twenty years of is career, his early oils and later more intricate works. Mr. Gorbachev has had his work exhibited over the past several years at the Mora Museum of Russian Art, NY, 2011, the St. Petersburg State Museum of Urban Art 2010; the National Fine Art Museum of The Ukraine, 2000; the Moscow Museum of Modern Art, 2003; the Russian Museum of Kiev, 2005; the Odessa State Literature Museum, 2005 and 2006; the Donezk Museum of Fine Art, 2006; Museum Conjunto Cultural da Caixa, Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2005. Brazil‚Äôs major magazine, Caras, featured Gorbachev as person of the year 2006. Gorbachev‚Äôs exhibit, visited by many thousands of people, became a cultural phenomenon in San Paulo- his images were reproduced on T-shirts, scarves, clothing and worn by stars like the Rolling Stones, Bono, Jamie Fox, and many other visiting luminaries. In June 2009, the first Russian Art Fair in London displayed a stunning array of the finest Russian art from the last millennium, including classical icons from the tenth century through the nineteenth century; art from the Hermitage Collection; works by Faberge; classical painters like Goncharova, Malevich and Chagall among many others. Yuri Gorbachev aptly named ‚Äúthe angel from Russia‚Äù was the brightest and best of the living artists represented at the London Art Fair. Although Gorbachev‚Äôs art has been acknowledged worldwide and he has received numerous prizes and awards, he continues to work with inexhaustible energy with Russia always at the center of his inspiration. 2010 heralded a landmark exhibition of Gorbachev‚Äôs paintings. The St. Petersburg State Museum of Urban Art & Sculpture held a major and extensive exhibit of Yuri Gorbachev's works. Attendance broke all records for this museum, and the show was a critically acclaimed success. In 2011, The Russian National Museum of St. Petersburg, Russia, the most important museum of Russian art worldwide, accepted Gorbachev's major oil painting Tsar Nicholas and his Family into their Permanent Collection. Gorbachev's museum tour continues through 2015, with the National Gallery of Fine Art Plovdiv, Bulgaria, opening July, 2012, the Literature Museum of Odessa, Ukraine, August, 2012, and future exhibitions in Major Museums in Kiev, Moscow, St. Petersburg and other countries. 2012-2013 opening new exhibition art Museum Shabo, UA. In an article in The New York Times, journalist Carey Goldberg said \\"There is no better interview subject than a man who just wants to make people happy. A man so brimming with energy that he repeats and re-repeats words of emphasis, a man with a mission so simple and sweet that it works for Americans and Russians and Indonesians alike. And there is no better art, to my taste, than art that radiates the same kind of joie de vivre so that it acts as a tonic on all those who see it, uplifting not only with its beauty but with an exuberance as potent as the blooming of northern plants in summer.

He rode with Wyatt Earp as a member of the posse during the Earp Vendetta Ride. Early life Johnson was thought to be a former bookkeeper and lawyer, coming from Missouri. Wyatt Earp believed that Johnson's real name was John Blunt, but there is no evidence to support this and Blunt was not a gunman. It is known that in 1881 he was 34 years of age. He and his brothers are alleged to have fled Missouri after being involved in a violent street clash in the mining town of Webb City, Missouri. His supposed brother, Bud Blunt, a known drunkard who had killed a man in Tip Top, Arizona in 1881, was sent to Yuma Prison. Johnson was not actually a \\"gunman\\" in the traditional sense, but was inaccurately portrayed as such in Stuart N. Lake's mostly fictional book. Earp claimed to use him as an \\"informer\\" on the Cowboys. Gunfights 1872 and 1876 Reportedly Johnson was involved in two Gunfights: *November 6, 1872 Newton, Kansas Town Marshal Johnson killed M.J. Fitzpatrick who in a drunken quarrel had killed Judge George Halliday.an account of the shootings was reprinted in The Wichita City Eagle November 14, 1872 p.2 (Library of Congress accessed July 6,2020 The Wichita City Eagle November 28, 1872 p.2 (Library of Congress accessed July 6,2020 This same man named John Johnson was possibly in Tombstone according to the 1880 Census and may have ridden with Wyatt Earp, indicating \\"Turkey Creek\\" Jack Johnson and John Johnson, the marshal, are likely one and the same. *Johnson supposedly spent some time in Deadwood in the Dakota Territory in 1876. He is said to have participated in a gunfight in 1876, where he calmly and slowly used two pistol shots to kill two men at a distance of 30 yards after allegations of cheating were charged following a game of poker. They were both trying to kill him with multiple pistol shots - their mistake was trying to use a \\"quick draw\\" while moving towards Johnson. Their spray of shots went wild. Johnson simply turned sideways to make himself a smaller target, raised his opposite arm to use as a gun rest and took a bead on each man, killing them with one shot apiece. It is debated as to whether this actually occurred, but town historians and modern day event enactors stated publicly in August, 2013 that there were not one but two separate stories published about this gunfight in the Deadwood town newspaper in the days following its occurrence. Riding with Cowboys Johnson is believed to have later spent time in Dodge City, Kansas. Little is known about exactly when he met Wyatt Earp. It could have been during Wyatt's buffalo hunting days, in Deadwood, or during the time that both were in Dodge City. He is believed to have first ventured into Arizona Territory while working in a cattle drive, alongside Sherman McMaster, \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius, and Pony Diehl, in late 1878. Brocius and Diehl had only recently left the \\"Murphy-Dolan\\" faction, having both taken part in the Lincoln County War, opposite Billy the Kid and his \\"Regulators\\". There is no evidence that Johnson took part in that range war, nor that he knew Brocius or Diehl prior to the cattle drive. Riding with the Earp Vendetta Writer John H. Flood, in his unpublished 1926 manuscript Wyatt Earp biography (for which many details came from Wyatt himself) said that Johnson was an old friend of the Earps when they came to Tombstone, and this fits with the fact of Johnson's presence on the train to protect Virgil as he left Tombstone for the last time, March 20, 1882. As a posseman in the Earp posse which protected Virgil on the train, Johnson (as \\"John Johnson\\") was co-indicted in absentia with Doc Holliday, Wyatt Earp, Warren Earp, and Sherman McMaster in the killing of Frank Stilwell in Tucson, March 20, 1882. Johnson returned with the others to Tombstone on a freight train that night, and the next day (now joined by Texas Jack Vermillion) rode out in the Earp vendetta ride of 1882, by which time he was a wanted man in the territory for the killing of Stilwell. Death After the Earp vendetta ride, Johnson escaped through Colorado, then Texas. According to the Flood manuscript, Johnson died of tuberculosis in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, in 1887, survived there by a widow. The Flood manuscript biography states that Johnson was a member of the masonic lodge in Salt Lake City, and estimated that his age at death was about 35 (this last information has been used to estimate the birthdate given above; however it is heavily suspect, as Flood's information on the death age of Vermillion is very erroneous).

Moonlight served as Governor of Wyoming Territory from 1887 to 1889. Birth Moonlight was born in Forfarshire, Scotland. He was baptized on 30 September 1833 in St Vigeans, Angus, Scotland with birth record number 319/0040 0169. His family can be traced in Scotland back to the 1600s, and to Archibald Moonlight and his wife Margaret Elspet Andersone. Moonlight was one of 10 children. Moonlight's birth date is frequently quoted as 10 November 1833 (including on his grave marker), but his baptism records exist for 30 September 1833. Early Scottish and English record keeping relied on the church where more commonly the baptism date and not birth date was recorded. It was not until government record keeping began that formal birth dates were recorded. Early life When he was seven, records show he lived in Gallowden on a farm with about ninety acres. Moonlight lived with his family and a maid. By 1851, Moonlight no longer lived with his family, which supports evidence he left Scotland at an early age. Some think that he left Scotland alone, but family stories say he possibly left with his two cousins, George and Thomas. Moonlight is thought to have worked farms in the East until he enlisted in the army at the age of twenty. Just as Thomas achieved fame in the US, his cousin George eventually left America and achieved fame as a Pioneer and Prospector in New Zealand where the township of Moonlight is named after him. George was said to have retained his American accent all his life and took the name Captain George Fairweather Moonlight. As he had no right to the title Captain, speculation is he adopted Thomas's military achievements in the US. Several places in New Zealand were named by George (Shenandoah River, Rappahannock, Minnehaha) taking America to New Zealand. Both of his cousins are buried in Nelson, New Zealand. Life in the United States =Civil War= In 1853, at the age of twenty, Moonlight enlisted in the 4th U.S. Artillery Regiment (Company D). He served in Texas from 1853 to 1856, and was promoted to the rank of orderly sergeant. Moonlight settled in Leavenworth County, Kansas in 1860. When the American Civil War began in 1861, Moonlight raised a company of artillery for the 4th Kansas Infantry, but the regiment never completed organization. The recruits to the company (and another regiment) were reassigned to the 1st Kansas Battery; Moonlight briefly served as its captain. Moonlight later joined the 11th Kansas Infantry as its lieutenant colonel. The regiment became the 11th Kansas Cavalry and Moonlight its colonel. Moonlight briefly commanded the 14th Kansas Cavalry as lieutenant colonel but was later ordered to return to the 11th Kansas Cavalry. His service during the war was primarily in Kansas against bushwhackers and border guerrillas. He also pursued William C. Quantrill's raiders following the Lawrence Massacre. In 1864, he commanded the 3rd Sub-district in the District of South Kansas. During Sterling Price's Missouri Raid in 1864, Colonel Moonlight commanded the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division in the Army of the Border and was conspicuous at the Battle of Westport. =Indian wars= Toward the end of the war, Moonlight was in command of the District of Colorado and campaigned against Indians on the plains. On February 13, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Moonlight for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from February 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on February 23, 1865.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 753. In April 1865, Moonlight became the commander of the north sub-district of the Great Plains headquartered at Fort Laramie, Wyoming. On May 26, Moonlight hanged two Oglala Lakota Sioux chiefs, Two Face and Black Foot. A white woman, Lucinda Ewbanks, and her small child were discovered living in pitiful condition among the Oglala bands. They had been kidnapped by Cheyenne almost a year earlier and sold to the Oglala band of Two Face and Black Foot. Moonlight ordered the two Oglala hanged, apparently over the opposition of Mrs. Ewbanks and although warned by civilians at the fort of repercussions.McDermott, pp. 60-62 George Bent and others tell the story differently. He said the two Oglala ransomed the woman from the Cheyenne and brought her into the fort as a peace gesture. Moonlight, however, arrested and hanged them, an action which Mrs. Ewbanks protested. Their bodies, and also that of a Cheyenne, were left hanging from the gallows for months in public view.Hyde, 208; Johnson, Dorothy M. \\"The Hanging of the Chiefs\\" Montana: The Magazine of Western History, Vol. 20, No. 3 (Summer 1970), pp 60-69 On June 3, the army fearing that the 1,500 Lakota, mostly Brul√©, and Arapaho living near Fort Laramie, might become hostile, decided to move them about 300 miles east to Fort Kearny in Nebraska. The Indian protested that Fort Kearny was in Pawnee territory and the Pawnee were their traditional enemies. Moreover, they feared, with reason, there would be no food for them at Fort Kearny. The army insisted and the Indians, with an escort of 138 cavalrymen under Captain William D. Fouts, departed Fort Laramie on June 11. However, on June 13, near present-day Morrill, Nebraska, some of the Indians decided to flee northward across the North Platte River. Attempting to stop them, Fouts and four soldiers were killed.McDermott, pp. 70-73 Hearing of the disaster, Moonlight departed Fort Laramie with 234 cavalry to pursue the Indians. He traveled so fast that many of his men had to turn back because their horses were spent. On June 17, near present-day Harrison, Nebraska, the Lakota raided his horse herd and relieved him of most of his remaining horses. Moonlight and many of his men had to walk 60 miles back to Fort Laramie. Moonlight was severely criticized by his soldiers for being drunk and not guarding the horse herd. On July 7, Moonlight was relieved of his command and mustered out of the army.McDermott, pp. 73-75 =Political career= Moonlight returned to his farm and became involved in politics in the state of Kansas. He was a Republican until 1870, when he switched to Democrat. He served as the Kansas Secretary of State, and also as State Senator.Kansas Legislators Past and Present From January 8, 1883 to January 22, 1885 he served as the Adjutant General of Kansas. Moonlight was appointed governor of the Wyoming Territory by President Grover Cleveland on January 5, 1887. Moonlight served as governor until April 9, 1889. After his term as governor, he served as United States Minister to Bolivia from 1893 to 1897. He was unsuccessful in his run for governor of Kansas in 1886. Family life Moonlight married Ellen Elizabeth Murray (born in Ireland) and they had seven children. Death Moonlight died on February 7, 1899, and is buried in Mount Muncie Cemetery in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Moonlight's wife is buried in the same cemetery.

Drawing on archaeological evidence and contemporary documents in Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, Latin and Syriac, Crone and Cook depict an early Islam very different from the traditionally-accepted version derived from Muslim historical accounts.Daniel Pipes. \\"Lessons from the Prophet Muhammad's Diplomacy\\". The Middle East Quarterly. September 1999. Volume VI: Number 3. According to the authors, Hagarenes is a term used commonly by various sources (Greek 'Magaritai', Syriac 'Mahgre' or 'Mahgraye') to describe the 7th-century Arab conquerors. According to them, the Arab conquests and the formation of the caliphate were a peninsular Arab movement inspired by Jewish messianism. In alliance with the Jews, the Arabs attempted to reclaim the Promised Land from the Byzantine Empire. The Qur'an was a product of 8th- century edits of various materials drawn from a variety of Judeo-Christian and Middle-Eastern sources while Muhammad was the herald of Umar \\"the redeemer\\", a Judaic messiah.Ibn Warraq, The Origins of The Koran: Classic Essays on Islam's Holy Book, 1998 Although the central hypotheses behind Hagarism have been generally rejected, even by the authors themselves,Khan, Ali, Free Markets of Islamic Jurisprudence. Michigan State Law Review, 2006, p. 48. Also available at Washburn Law, p. 1535. the book has been hailed as a seminal work in its branch of Islamic historiography, and has been said to have \\"explod[ed] the academic consensus\\" that deferred to the traditional Islamic narrative of Islam's origins. The book came under immediate attack from Muslim and non- Muslim scholars alike for its heavy reliance on hostile sources, inauthenticity and superficiality and the authors have later dismissed their revisionist claims. Synopsis Cook and Crone postulate that \\"Hagarism\\" started as a \\"Jewish messianic movement\\" to \\"reestablish Judaism\\" in the Jewish Holyland (Palestine) and known at first as muhajirun, not Muslims, their hijra (migration) was to Jerusalem not Medina. Its members were both Jewish and Arab to begin with but \\"with the Arabs' increasing success\\" that group broke with the Jews (culminating around the time of Abd al-Mk ibn Marwan). They first flirted with Christianity and adopted a respect for Jesus as prophet and Mary as Virgin, before asserting a new independent Abrahamic monotheist identity. This borrowed from the Jewish breakaway sect of Samaritanism \\"the idea of a scripture limited to the Pentateuch, a prophet like Moses (Muhammad), a holy book revealed like the Torah (the Quran), a sacred city (Mecca) with a nearby mountain (Jabal an-Nour) and shrine (the Kaaba) of an appropriate patriarch (Abraham), plus a caliphate modeled on an Aaronid priesthood.\\" =Methodology= Hagarism begins with the premise that Western historical scholarship on the beginnings of Islam should be based on contemporary historical, archaeological and philological data, as is done for the study of Judaism and Christianity, rather than Islamic traditions and later Arabic writings. The tradition expresses dogma, and tells historically irreconcilable and anachronistic accounts of the community's past. By relying on contemporary historical, archaeological and philological evidence, stressing non-Muslim sources, the authors attempt to reconstruct and present what they argue is a more historically accurate account of Islam's origins. =The term Hagarism= According to the authors, Hagarenes is a term used commonly by various sources (Greek 'Magaritai', Syriac 'Mahgre' or 'Mahgraye') to describe the 7th-century Arab conquerors. The word was a self-designation of the early Muslim community with a double-meaning. Firstly, it is a cognate of muhƒÅjir≈´n, an Arabic term for those who partake in hijra (exodus). Secondly, it refers to Ishmaelites: descendants of Abraham through his handmaid Hagar and their child Ishmael, in the same way as the Jews claimed descent and their ancestral faith from Abraham through his wife Sarah and their child Isaac. Muhammad would have claimed such descent for Arabs to give them a birthright to the Holy Land and to prepend a monotheist genealogy compatible with Judaism to their pagan ancestral practice (such as sacrifice and circumcision). Hagarism thus refers to this early faith movement. The designation as Muslims and Islam would only come later, after the success of conquests made the duty of hijra obsolete. =Origins= The authors, interpreting 7th century Syriac, Armenian and Hebrew sources, put forward the hypothesis that Muhammad was alive during the conquest of Palestine (about two years longer than traditionally believed; the caliphate of Abu Bakr was hence a later invention). He led Jews and Hagarenes (Arabs) united under a faith loosely described as Judeo-Hagarism, as a prophet preaching the coming of a Judaic messiah who would redeem the Promised Land from the Christian Byzantines. This redeemer came in the person of Umar, as suggested by the Aramaic origins of his epiteth 'Al-Faruq'. The hijra, the defining idea and religious duty of Hagarenes, thus referred to the emigration from northern Arabia to Palestine (later more generally to conquered territories), not to a single exodus from Mecca to Medina (in particular, \\"no seventh-century source identifies the Arab era as that of the hijra\\"). Mecca was only a secondary sanctuary; the initial gathering of Hagarenes and Jews took place rather somewhere in north-west Arabia, north of Medina. =Development= After the successful conquest of the Holy Land, Hagarenes feared that being too influenced by Judaism might result in outright conversion and assimilation. In order to break with Jewish messianism, they recognised Jesus as messiah (though rejecting his crucifixion), which also served to soften the initially hostile attitude towards a growing numbers of Christian subjects. However, to form a distinct identity, not conflated with either Judaism or Christianity, ancestral practice was reframed as a distinct monotheistic Abrahamic religion. It took the Samaritan scriptural position, defined as accepting the Pentateuch while rejecting prophets. This also served to undermine the legitimacy of the Davidic monarchy, which the Samaritans rejected, as well as the sanctity of Jerusalem. Instead, Samaritans had had their holy city in Shechem and a temple on the nearby Mount Gerizim; Mecca with its nearby mountain were contrived as a parallel of these. To combine the Abrahamic, Christian, and Samaritan elements, the role of Muhammad was recast as a prophet parallel to Moses, bringing a new scriptural revelation. The Quran was expeditiously collected from earlier disparate Hagarene writings, possibly heavily edited into its complete form by al-Hajjaj (that is, in the last decade of the 7th century rather than the middle, under Uthman, as traditionally believed; see Origin according to academic historians). The political theory of early Islam was based on two sources. The first was Samaritan high-priesthood, which joins political and religious authority and legitimises it on basis of religious knowledge and genealogy. Secondly, a resurgence of Judaic influences in Babylonian Iraq, which led to the reassertion of messianism in the form of mahdism, especially in Shia Islam. The identification as Hagarenes was replaced with the Samaritan notion of Islam (understood as submission or as a covenant of peace), its adherents becoming Muslims. =Consolidation in Iraq= The transition to a confident, recognisably Islamic identity, with its various borrowings assimilated, occurred in the late 7th century, during the reign of Abd al-Malik. However, its evolution continued. As power was transferred from Syria to Iraq, Islam incorporated the rabbinical culture of Babylonian Judaism: religious law practised by a learned laity and based on oral traditions. In the second half of the eighth century, the early Mu øtazila, simultaneously with Karaite Judaism, rejected all oral traditions, leading to a failed attempt to base law on Greek rationalism. In response, scholars followed Shafi'i in gathering chains of authorities (isnads) to support traditions item by item. This original solution finalised the independence of Islam from Judaism. Part I of the book ends by considering the peculiar state in which the Hagarenes found themselves: their own success pushed them away from the sanctuaries of Jerusalem and Mecca to Babylonia, as finalised by the Abbasid Revolution; Umar had already lived and there was no lost land or freedom to hope for. This led Sunni religious politics into quietism under a desanctified state, contrasted only with \\"Sufi resignation\\". =Wider context= The remainder of the book, Parts II and III, discuss later developments and the larger context in which Islam originated: the Late Antique Near East, and relate it to theoretical themes of cultural history. This contrasts with the usual setting, focusing almost exclusively on Arabian indigenous polytheistic beliefs (jahiliyya). Reception The controversial thesis of Hagarism is not widely accepted. Crone and Cook's work was part of revisionist history arising from several scholars associated with the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), beginning in the 1970s. They introduced methods from biblical studies as a new way of analyzing the history of the Koran and Islam, for instance, the use of contemporary texts in languages other than that used in the holy text, and incorporating evidence from archeology and linguistics. Their work has presented the Koran as \\"a scripture with a history\\", as Patricia Crone said in a 1999 interview in The Atlantic Monthly. In 1995, Michael Lecker proposed more conservative theories of early Jewish/Islamic relations in his articles \\"The conversion of Himyar to Judaism and the Jewish Banu Hadl of Medina\\"Michael Lecker, \\"The conversion of Himyar to Judaism and the Jewish Banu Hadl of Medina\\", Die Welt des Orients 26, Gottingen, 1995 and \\"Judaism among Kinda and the 'ridda' of Kinda\\".Michael Lecker, Judaism among Kind and the ridda of Kinda, Journal of the American Oriental Society 115, New Haven, 1995 His 1997 article \\"Zayd b.

Hoyland characterized Hagarism as evolving into a wider inter-disciplinary and literary approach, and said that additional studies would be published in the Studies in Late Antiquity and Early Islam (SLAEI Series) in which his book appears. Since then the \\"SUNY Series in Near Eastern Studies\\"(SUNY Series in Near Eastern Studies). Albany, NY, U.S.A.: State University of New York Press has also published a selection of authors who are continuing to produce work related to a modified form of this theory. In 2002, David Cook, in discussing the A'maq Cycle of historical apocalypses, says that this genre of Islamic literature \\"could in fact be based on some historical kernel, since ... the Muslims shared with the Jews the desire to build the Third Temple.\\"David Cook, Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic, (Studies in Late Antiquity and Early Islam); Darwin Press, 2002 The 2012 documentary Islam: The Untold Story, by English novelist and popular historian Tom Holland, is based on Crone's theories. Hagarism was acknowledged as raising some interesting questions and being a fresh approach in its reconstruction of early Islamic history, but it was described by Josef van Ess as an experiment.van Ess, \\"The Making Of Islam\\", Times Literary Supplement, 8 September 1978, p. 998 He argued that: \\"... a refutation is perhaps unnecessary since the authors make no effort to prove it (the hypothesis of the book) in detail ... Where they are only giving a new interpretation of well-known facts, this is not decisive. But where the accepted facts are consciously put upside down, their approach is disastrous.\\" Steven Humphreys criticised the authors for their \\"... use (or abuse) of its Greek and Syriac sources ...\\"Stephen Humphreys, Islamic History, (Princeton, 1991) pp. 84‚Äì85. > \\"Unsurprisingly, the Crone-Cook interpretation has failed to win general > acceptance among Western Orientalists, let alone Muslim scholars ... The > rhetoric of these authors may be an obstacle for many readers, for their > argument is conveyed through a dizzying and unrelenting array of allusions, > metaphors, and analogies. More substantively, their use (or abuse) of the > Greek and Syriac sources has been sharply criticised. In the end, perhaps we > ought to use Hagarism more as a 'what-if' exercise than as a research > monograph.\\" R. B. Serjeant wrote in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society that Hagarism is \\"not only bitterly anti-Islamic in tone, but anti-Arabian. Its superficial fancies are so ridiculous that at first one wonders if it is just a 'leg pull', pure 'spoof'.\\"R. B. Serjeant, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1978). p. 78 Eric Manheimer, reviewing the work in the American Historical Review, commented that, \\"The research on Hagarism is thorough, but this reviewer feels that the conclusions drawn lack balance. The weights on the scales tip too easily toward the hypercritical side, tending to distract from what might have been an excellent study in comparative religion.\\"Eric I. Manheimer. \\" Review\\". The American Historical Review, Vol. 83, No. 1. (Feb., 1978), pp. 240‚Äì241 David Waines, Professor of Islamic Studies Lancaster University states: \\"The Crone-Cook theory has been almost universally rejected. The evidence offered by the authors is far too tentative and conjectural (and possibly contradictory) to conclude that Arab-Jewish relations were as intimate as they would wish them to have been.\\"Introduction to Islam, Cambridge, Eng.: Cambridge University Press, 1995. , pp 273‚Äì274 John Wansbrough, who had mentored the authors, reviewed the book, specifically the first part, in the Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies. He begins by praising the book claiming, \\"the authors' erudition is extraordinary their industry everywhere evident, their prose ebullient.\\" But, he says that, \\"... most, if not all, [of the sources] have been or can be challenged on suspicion of inauthenticity\\" and that \\"the material is upon occasion misleadingly represented ... My reservations here, and elsewhere in this first part of the book, turn upon what I take to be the authors' methodological assumptions, of which the principal must be that a vocabulary of motives can be freely extrapolated from a discrete collection of literary stereotypes composed by alien and mostly hostile observers, and thereupon employed to describe, even interpret, not merely the overt behaviour but also intellectual and spiritual development of the helpless and mostly innocent actors. Where even the sociologist fears to tread, the historian ought not with impunity be permitted to go.\\"J. Wansbrough. \\"Review\\", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 41, No. 1. (1978), pp. 155‚Äì156. Oleg Grabar described Hagarism as a \\"brilliant, fascinating, original, arrogant, highly debatable book\\" and writes that \\"... the authors' fascination with lapidary formulas led them to cheap statements or to statements which require unusual intellectual gymnastics to comprehend and which become useless, at best cute\\" and that \\"... the whole construction proposed by the authors lacks entirely in truly historical foundations\\" but also praised the authors for trying to \\"relate the Muslim phenomenon to broad theories of acculturation and historical change.\\"Grabar, Oleg. Speculum, Vol. 53, No. 4. (Oct., 1978), pp. 795‚Äì799. The classicist Norman O. Brown wrote in Apocalypse and/or Metamorphosis (1991) that Hagarism, \\"illustrates in an ominous way the politics of Orientalism\\", and citing Grabar's review, added that, \\"The Western tradition of urbane condescension has degenerated into aggressive, unscrupulous even, calumny\\".Norman O. Brown, Apocalypse and/or Metamorphosis, 1991, University of California Press, p. 65 Michael G. Morony remarked that \\"Despite a useful bibliography, this is a thin piece of Kulturgeschichte full of glib generalizations, facile assumptions, and tiresome jargon.

Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, Vol. 40, No. 2 (December 2006), pp. 197-199 Both Patricia Crone and Michael Cook have later suggested that the central thesis of the book was mistaken because the evidence they had to support the thesis was not sufficient or internally consistent enough.

The people who dress up as Garuda perform the dance. After the dance performance, the hang-designate dangle from a shaft hooking the skin on his back. In some places, the ritual is performed colorfully with Garudas taken in a procession on bullock carts or boats or hand pulled carts. It will be available in Devi temple during the festival of Meena bharani and Pathamudayam in Thiruvanchoor in Kottayam district. Legend has it that even after slaying Darika, Kali remained insatiable and thirsty. At this time Vishnu sent Garuda to Kali to quench the thirst. A dancing and bleeding Garuda was taken to Kali and only after getting some drops of blood from Garuda, Kali was pacified. The ritual is performed based on this belief. Garudan Thookam is submitted as a reward for the problems solved in the abode of Goddess Kali. There is a famous Garudan Thookam at the Elamkavu Devi temple at Vadayar in Vaikkom taluk of Kottayam district. During the Aswathi, Bharani days of Meenam Month (Malayalam), more than 40 to 50 Garudan in the Thooka chadus, decorated and floated in thoni vallams (big country-boats), travel behind the Attuvela - a wooden structure constructed in the form of a three storied building which is considered as the floating temple of the Goddess Kali in the Moovattupuzha river. This is one of the best sights, with illuminated Structures. After the night long performance with the help of scores of chenda experts, the Garudans - bleeding after the Choondakuthal (Piercing of the skin on their back with a sharp metal hook) will be hung on a tall pedestal-like structure and taken thrice around the temple by the devotees. This is seen at the Pazhaveedu temple at Alappuzha district. But here the performance is done on a chariot- like structure on the road. This ritual is performed at Pallikkalkavu Bhagavathi temple (Njeezhoor, Kottayam (Dist)) on Makara Bharani day. This ritual was performed at Kottekkavu Bhagavathy temple (Ernakulam Dist) on Meenabharani.This is also performed at the Kanichukulangara Temple (Alappuzha) annually. Araynkavu Devi temple Ernakulam dist (on Pooram, Meenam) and Irapuram Devi temple near permbavur (on Kumbha Bharani day) has the highest number of garduan thookkam in Kerala.

He was first introduced to the series as a regular character from 7 June 1999 to 10 July 2000 before returning as one of the show's primary antagonists from 26 February to 16 August 2001. The character originally appeared in Albert Square as the new boyfriend of local resident Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), but it quickly transpired that Dan had previously had a relationship with her daughter Bianca (Patsy Palmer); he soon embarked on an affair with Bianca until her mother eventually found out about it and Carol thereupon exposed this to Bianca's husband Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) ‚Äî which later resulted in the latter being written out of the programme alongside both Bianca and Carol. Soon afterwards, Dan established an intense feud with Ricky's stepbrother Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden); they started out as best-friends when Phil's brother Grant (Ross Kemp) left the square and even went into business partnership at The Queen Victoria public house, but ended up becoming archenemies after Phil conned Dan's ownership of the pub in retribution for Dan reporting Phil to the police about his motor scam with both Ricky's father Frank (Mike Reid) and his longtime companion Roy Evans (Tony Caunter). Their escalating hostility towards one another continued to develop in the events of the Who Shot Phil? storyline, wherein Dan becomes a prime suspect after Phil gets shot on the night their ex-lover Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) married the duo's fellow nemesis Steve Owen (Martin Kemp). By then, Dan's established rivalries with Phil and Steve were respectively steamed from each of their own romances with Mel ‚Äî whom Dan had formerly dated after his relationship with one of the pub's customers, Teresa di Marco (Leila Birch), ended with the character sparking a conflict with her overprotective brother Gianni (Marc Bannerman). He also ends up clashing with the Mitchell family amid the \\"Who Shot Phil\\" scenario by quarreling against Phil's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor); extorting money from his godson Jamie (Jack Ryder); and antagonizing the latter's estranged uncle Billy (Perry Fenwick). Although it was ultimately revealed on 5 April 2001 that Phil's ex-girlfriend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin) was in fact the shooter, Phil ends up framing Dan for the crime by colluding with his former crime boss Ritchie Stringer (Gareth Hunt) against him; Dan is consequently arrested and wrongfully imprisoned prior to his trial in mid-summer 2001. While Phil and Steve ‚Äî though sworn enemies ‚Äî worked together to rid themselves of their common adversary, the trial culminated with Dan being found not guilty by the jury. The character then exited the show in 16 August 2001 after representing a episodic week that featured Dan kidnapping Mel and holding her ransom to get revenge on Phil and Steve for conspiring to get him sent down ‚Äî by blackmailing the pair into giving him ¬£100,000 each before fleeing the square with his ransom money. Storylines Dan Sullivan arrives in Walford ‚Äî a fictionalized borough in East London ‚Äî on 7 June 1999, appearing as the latest boyfriend of local caf√© manager Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson). They soon move to Walford's local community, Albert Square, where the couple plan to get married after Dan learns that Carol is expecting his child. Their wedding plans surprise Carol's daughter Bianca (Patsy Palmer), as she and Dan had had a fling when she was a teenager on holiday many years before. After the pair find themselves secretly reacquainted with each other, Dan and Bianca start an affair ‚Äî even though she is married to local resident Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), who ends up befriending Dan. Eventually, Carol discovers the affair and publicly exposes it in front of Ricky and their neighbors. She then disowns Bianca, breaks-up with Dan by chucking him out of her house, and later aborts their child before leaving Walford. Bianca subsequently departs the square after she and Dan are unable to resume their relationship. Shortly afterwards, Dan and Ricky begin to clash after Ricky blames Dan for ruining his life and marriage with Bianca. The hostility between them escalates when Dan begins to flirt with Ricky's sister Janine (Charlie Brooks), which promptly sparks a conflict between the siblings' father Frank (Mike Reid) and Dan himself. One such incident between them involves Frank punching Dan for making remarks on how he brought up his children. This eventually becomes too much for Ricky, who ends up leaving the square in April 2000. It is at this point where Dan has become closely acquainted with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) ‚Äî the square's local hardman who is also partly related to the Butcher family as he is Ricky's former brother-in-law and Frank's eldest stepson. Dan quickly establishes himself as Phil's best-friend as the two continue to bond over their relationship problems and business interests, with Phil even confining to Dan about how Ricky previously married his sister Sam (Danniella Westbrook) before his marriage with Bianca emerged years afterwards. Towards the Millennium celebrations, Dan finds Phil spending his Christmas alone at The Queen Victoria public house and comforts him over his wife Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) and their son Ben leaving the county without him months ago. They soon proceed to form a business partnership when Phil sells his ownership of The Queen Vic to Dan for ¬£5; with Phil having done so to spite his mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) in retribution for supposedly favoring his brother Grant (Ross Kemp), who recently left the square following a botched criminal job between the brothers, more than him. Phil slowly regrets this decision after his girlfriend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin) confronts him for upsetting Peggy. However, Dan refuses to relinquish his ownership of the pub back to Peggy and later discovers that Phil is running a car lot scam with both Frank and their colleague Roy Evans (Tony Caunter). When Lisa is rushed to hospital one night, Dan offers Phil a lift to the hospital and the two begin arguing over his ownership of the pub ‚Äî which Dan once again refuses to relinquish back to Peggy for ¬£10,000. Phil lashes out in response to this, but Dan overpowers Phil and threatens to report him to the police. Phil backs down and leaves Dan outside of the hospital, where inside he finds out out that Lisa has suffered a miscarriage and that their unborn baby has died. The next day, Dan learns that Phil plans to kick him out of the house and responds by reporting his motor scam to the police; Phil later changes his mind after he makes amends with Dan, and the two plan on further establishing their partnership whilst Dan hopes to cover-up his betrayal from Phil. By then, Dan has romantically bonded with Phil's barmaid and Lisa's best-friend: Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). Their growing relationship is initially contracted when Dan befriends and later dates one of the pub's regular customers, Teresa di Marco (Leila Birch), which causes her overprotective brother Gianni (Marc Bannerman) to become suspicious over his intentions. When Gianni witnesses Dan further wooing Teresa and her friends, he confronts them and warns Dan to stay away from his sister. They nearly brawl after Gianni chucks a drink at Dan for dismissing him, but Mel separates them and Teresa later ends her crush on Dan at her family's urging. Dan then continues to develop his relationship with Mel, who soon learns about him reporting Phil and his motor scam to the police. Mel subsequently confines this secrecy to Lisa, who ends up telling Phil about Dan tipping off the police about his motor scam. This causes Phil to end his friendship with Dan, and he later plots to win back his share of the pub as payback. Phil arranges a card game between him and Dan, who ends up losing after the former tricks him into refunding his ¬£5. Outraged, Dan swears revenge on Phil. He soon learns that Mel told Phil about his tip-off and, suspecting that she conspired with Phil against him, begins stalking her ‚Äî up to the point where he even threatens Mel with phone calls. This continues until Dan, while corning Mel just as she finishes one of her with her night shifts at the pub, finds himself confronted by her boyfriend Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) ‚Äî who threatens to kill Dan unless he leaves the square. At first Dan ignores Steve and plans to further harass Mel, but is forced to change his mind when Steve visits him with a gun ‚Äî thus making his threat clear; Dan seemingly complies to his demands and leaves the square on 7 July 2000. Six months later, Dan returns to the square in 26 February 2001 ‚Äî still determined to get revenge on Phil. He plans to confirm this to Steve and, after learning that he and Mel are set to get married at the start of March 2001, sets out to visit him at his nightclub; the E20. There, he finds Phil's cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick) working as Steve's secretary and orders him to summon Steve himself. Billy initially refuses and attempts to threaten Dan by brandishing Steve's gun out of his safe, but Dan is unfazed and ‚Äî after taunting Billy over how he would really feel about killing a man ‚Äî easily disarms Billy, forcing him to drop his gun and discuss like \\"big boys\\". Moments later, Steve arrives and orders Billy to get out of his office. Dan then proceeds to sarcastically offer Steve his congratulations, and the two begin exchanging threats to each other when Steve reminds Dan of the last warning he gave him about leaving the square for good. Although Dan tells Steve that he is back in the square to deal with Phil and not Mel, he is dismissed at the expense of warning Steve to not be fooled by Mel as she previously did to her ex-husband Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Their conversation ends with Dan offering Steve a handshake, to which Steve threateningly rejects by telling Dan to get out of his office ‚Äî which prompts Dan to tell Steve that he'll regret crossing him. On the day Steve and Mel get married, Dan approaches Billy at Steve's wedding reception and demands that he bring Phil for him when the latter arrives. Billy complies and tells Phil that Dan is waiting for him in Steve's office, much to Steve's frustration. Upon confronting each other, Dan tells Phil that he plans to settle his score with him and begins to taunt him just as Phil gives Dan five seconds to get out of his sight. When Phil ends up chucking wine from his glass into Dan's face, Dan threatens Phil by promising him that he'll regret it. Later on that night, Phil is shot by an unknown assailant ‚Äî though not before Dan resorts to harassing him with phone calls. Following Phil's shooting, Dan becomes a prime suspect. He soon begins to target Phil's godson Jamie (Jack Ryder), threatening to inflict violence on the youngster unless he agrees to repay him the money Phil owes him. Jamie makes his effort to avoid succumbing to Dan's threats, even when Phil learns about Dan's comeback. Dan also continues to torment Mel once more, and begins clashing with Steve over their similar issues with Phil. It is soon revealed that Lisa is the culprit who shot Phil. After confronting Lisa over the shooting, Phil forgives her and decides to frame Dan ‚Äî knowing that Dan is a much bigger threat to him than Lisa. He first contacts Dan's former crime boss, Ritchie Stringer (Gareth Hunt), and together the pair hatch a plan where Dan would be given the same gun that Lisa used to shoot Phil. Once the weapon is in his position, Dan later confronts Phil at the garage to extort money from him ‚Äî threatening to shoot him otherwise. When Jamie ends up walking to see Phil being held at gunpoint, he attempts to disarm Dan ‚Äî who fights off Jamie and ends up shooting the garage's clock from the resulting impact. Moments later, the police arrive thanks to Phil's tip-off and Dan is consequently arrested; he is later charged with attempted murder and will be trialed for the crime in July 2001. As Dan's trial commences, Phil convinces Steve to work together in getting Dan imprisoned ‚Äî under the guise that the pair, though archenemies, would be well- ridden of their fellow nemesis and Mel's tormentor once and for all. Despite their efforts, however, Dan is found not guilty. Deducing that Phil had framed him for the shooting and that Steve had been conspiring with their shared enemy against him, Dan plans to get revenge on his two rivals ‚Äî up to the point where he wrongfully asserts that Steve is the one who shot Phil. He first blackmails Billy to gain leverage over the pair, and later kidnaps Mel as part of his plan to get ¬£200,000 ransom. He alerts Phil and Steve of Mel's kidnapping to blackmail the pair in delivering him the money in exchange for Mel's safety; with Phil being forced to deliver Steve's ¬£200,000 from his nightclub. Phil plans to take down Dan with a gun, but Dan discovers this and orders Phil to extract Mel on his own. Phil appears to oblige and first, but then surprises Dan and disarms him. Phil prepares to kill Dan, admitting that his habit of never really intentionally killing a man has changed in his case; Dan gets to be the first on Phil's list. However, Mel surprisingly helps Dan by turning off the lights ‚Äî allowing Dan to overpower Phil and leave him behind. Mel reluctantly helps Dan after he tells her about what Steve and Phil have been up to, without her knowing about it. After dropping off Mel at a rendezvous point, Dan leaves Walford in August 2001 ‚Äî considerably richer than when he first arrived. Though he is not seen again on the square again, Dan leaves flowers on Steve's grave following the latter's death in March 2002 ‚Äî at the epic climax of his feud with Phil ‚Äî bearing the message \\"Gotcha!\\". In 2003, Billy is led to believe that Dan is back in the square to settle a few scores after hearing rumors of his supposed comeback ‚Äî although this is off- screen. This is later revealed to be a hoax by the police to connect Phil to the alleged murder of Lisa. It soon transpires that Dan is last heard to be living in Spain, but having many brushes with the law ‚Äî just like he did in the square. Consequently, Dan is one of the few soap opera villains to not get killed off nor receive any comeuppance for his crimes. Development In 2001, it was reported by The Mirror, that Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) would be shot in a whodunnit style storyline. The possible suspects were Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite), Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Dan. Some bookmakers refused to take bets as they were convinced that Dan would commit the crime. The bookies' favourite for Phil's shooter was Dan, with the odds 3‚Äì1.

Chavittu Nadakam (Malayalam:‡¥ö‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡µÅ‡¥®‡¥æ‡¥ü‡¥ï‡¥Ç) is a highly colorful Latin Christian classical art form originated in Ernakulam district, Kerala state in India. Commonly believed that Fort Kochi is the birthplace of Chavittu Nadakam. It is noted for its attractive make-up of characters, their elaborate costumes, detailed gestures and well-defined body movements presented in tune with the rhythmic playback music and complementary percussion. This art form highly resembles European Opera. Chavittu Nadakam is believed to be originated during the 16th century AD. This form of play is prevalent among the Latin Christian community in the districts of Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur of Kerala. The most sensual blend of cultural influences can be seen in this Latin Christian dance-drama. In Chavittu Nadakam there are large number of characters all in glittering medieval dress. It is the form of traditional musical dance drama, which symbolizes the martial tradition of Kerala Latin Christians. History Chaviitu Nadakam is a Latin Christian folk art form of Kerala. It is originated in Cochin where the Latin Christian Portuguese missionaries have instituted their first mission. Chavittu Nadakam is believed to be originated after the arrival of Portuguese to the Kerala shores. The reason behind this assumption is that Chavittu Nadakam has a significant European character in its costumes and outfits. But there are historical evidences that Kerala had connections with the western world well before the arrival of Portuguese. Even though some argue that the Chavittu Nadakam is created by Portuguese as they felt cultural emptiness when they arrived at Kerala, there are no evidences supporting this view. Also the fact that Chavittu Nadakam uses language for its playback songs and dialogue, suggest that the art form is indigenous in origin. There are also claims that a Tamil named Chinnathambi Annavi as the founder of this art form in 16th century at Mattancherry. He is the author of one of the most famous plays in the art form ‚ÄòKaralman Charitham‚Äô (the story of Emperor Charlemagne aka Charles the Great). The art form was active from Kollam to Kodungallur at its peak. There were also other writers like Vedanayakam Pillai, a native of Neyyoor, Kanyakumari. In earlier days this art form was mostly encouraged by the Tamil population and were staged in church premises. Sanjon Annavi, Vareechan Annavi, Cherrechan Annavi and Anthony Annavi were some of the playwrights of the early days. Brazeena Natakam, Ouseph Natakam, Kathrina Natakam, Santi Claus Natakam, Karlman Natakam and Jnana Sundari were some of the popular plays of early days. Chavittu Nadakam attained the style and form of the operas of Europe under the influence of Portuguese and European missionaries who propagated catholic belief in coastal regions of Kerala. The Syrian Christians of Kerala who lived in inlands didn't show any inclination for the art and thus its popularity was confined to Latin Catholic community. Original Chavittu Nadakam costumes: Queen Brijeena from Brijeena Charitham play Performance The costumes used in Chavittu Nadakam Chavittu Nadakam is usually performed on open stages. Sometimes the interior of a church is also a venue. The performers wear glittering European costumes. The stage is set up over wooden planks. The training master is known as Annavi. The whole play is performed through musicals. Dance and instrumental music are combined in this art form. The bell and drum are two instruments used as background score. The percussion instruments Pada Thamber and Maravaladi provides the rhythm. The actors themselves sing and act. Though it used to be an open stage performance, in the recent times this is mostly played indoor. The predominant feature of this art is the artists stamping / pounding (Chavittu) the dance floor producing resonant sounds to accentuate the dramatic situations. The actors sing their lines loudly and with exaggerated gestures stamp with great force on the wooden stage. Hence literally Chavittu Nadakam means 'Stamping Drama'. Great stress is laid on the step, which goes in harmony with the songs. In these art forms there is a great importance for dance and art. Foot stamping dance, fighting and fencing are the essential part of Chavittunadakam. Royal dresses and ornamental costumes are necessary. The play is considered a success if at the end, the stage cave into the pressure of heavy stamping. Librettos The stories are mostly the heroic episodes of Bible or great Christian warriors. Historical incidents, the life and adventure of heroes like Charlemagne; stories of Alexander were the themes of Chavittu Nadakam in the 16th century. In the 18th century, spiritual themes like \\"Allesu-Nadakam\\", \\"Cathareena Nadakam\\", the victory of the Isaac, etc. were the themes.

Functioning in the first months of the Bosnian War in 1992, it was one of 677 alleged detention centers and camps set up throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war. While nominally an \\"investigation center\\" or \\"assembly point\\" for members of the Bosniak and Croatian population, Human Rights Watch classified Omarska as a concentration camp. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague, found several individuals guilty of crimes against humanity perpetrated at Omarska. Murder, torture, rape, and abuse of prisoners was common. Around 6,000 Bosniaks and Croats, mainly men, were held at the camp for about five months in the spring and summer of 1992. Hundreds died of starvation, punishment, beatings, ill- treatment and executions. Overview Omarska is a predominantly Serb village in northwestern Bosnia, near the town of Prijedor. The camp in the village existed from about 25 May to about 21 August 1992, when the Bosnian Serb military and police unlawfully segregated, detained and confined some of more than 7,000 Muslims and Bosnian Croats captured in Prijedor. Bosnian Serb authorities termed it an \\"investigation center\\" and the detainees were accused of paramilitary activities. By the end of 1992, the war had resulted in the death or forced departure of most of the Bosniak and Croat population of Prijedor municipality. About 7,000 people went missing from a population of 25,000, and there are 145 mass graves and hundreds of individual graves in the extended region. There is conflicting information about how many people were killed at Omarska. According to survivors, usually about 30 and sometimes as many as 150 men were singled out and killed in the camp every night. The U.S. State Department and other governments believe that, at a minimum, hundreds of detainees, some of whose identities are unknown, did not survive; many others were killed during the evacuation of the camps in the Prijedor area. Prijedor massacre A declaration on the takeover of Prijedor by Serb forces was prepared by Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) politicians and was repeatedly read out on Radio Prijedor the day after the takeover. Four-hundred Bosnian Serb policemen were assigned to participate in the takeover, the objective of which was to seize the functions of the president of the municipality, the vice-president of the municipality, the director of the post office, the chief of the police, etc. On the night of the 29/30 April 1992, the takeover of power took place. Serb employees of the public security station and reserve police gathered in Cirkin Polje, part of the town of Prijedor. The people there were given the task of taking over power in the municipality and were broadly divided into five groups. Each group of about twenty had a leader and each was ordered to gain control of certain buildings. One group was responsible for the Assembly building, one for the main police building, one for the courts, one for the bank and the last for the post-office. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that the takeover by the Serb politicians was an illegal coup d'√©tat, which was planned and coordinated long in advance with the ultimate aim of creating a pure Serbian municipality. These plans were never hidden and they were implemented in a coordinated action by the Serb police, army and politicians. One of the leading figures was Milomir Stakiƒá, who came to play the dominant role in the political life of the municipality. Camp In May 1992, intensive shelling and infantry attacks on Bosniak areas in the municipality caused the Bosniak survivors to flee their homes. The majority of them surrendered or were captured by Serb forces. As the Serb forces rounded up the Bosniak and Croat residents, they forced them to march in columns bound for one or another of the prison camps that the Serb authorities had established in the municipality. On about 25 May 1992, about three weeks after the Serbs took control of the municipal government, and two days after the start of large scale military attacks on Bosniak population centers, Serb forces began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp. During the next several weeks, the Serbs continued to round up Bosniaks and Croats from Kozarac near Prijedor, and other places in the municipality and send them to the camps. Many Bosniak and Croat intellectuals and politicians were sent to Omarska. While virtually all of the prisoners were male, there were also 37 women detained in the camp, who served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, and were repeatedly raped in the canteen; bodies of five of them have been exhumed. The Omarska mines complex was located about from Prijedor. The first detainees were taken to the camp at some point between 26 and 30 May. The camp buildings were almost completely full and some of the detainees had to be held in the area between the two main buildings. That area was lit up by specially installed spot-lights after the detainees arrived. Female detainees were held separately in the administrative building. According to the wartime documents of Serb authorities, there were a total of 3,334 persons held in the camp from 27 May to 16 August 1992; 3,197 were Bosniaks, 125 were Croats. Within the area of the Omarska mining complex that was used for the camp, the camp authorities generally confined the prisoners in three different buildings: the administration building, where interrogations and killings took place; the crammed hangar building; the \\"white house\\", where the inmates were tortured; and on a cement courtyard area between the buildings known as the \\"pista\\", an L-shaped strip of concrete land in between, also a scene of torture and mass killings. There was another small building, known as the \\"red house\\", where prisoners were sometimes taken in order to be summarily executed. With the arrival of the first detainees, permanent guard posts and anti-personnel landmines were set up around the camp. The conditions in the camp were horrible. In the building known as the \\"white house\\", the rooms were crowded with 45 people in a room no larger than . The faces of the detainees were distorted and bloodstained and the walls were covered with blood. From the beginning, the detainees were beaten with fists, rifle butts and wooden and metal sticks. The guards mostly hit the heart and kidneys whenever they decided to beat someone to death. In the \\"garage\\", between 150 and 160 people were \\"packed like sardines\\" and the heat was unbearable. For the first few days, the detainees were not allowed out and were given only a jerry can of water and some bread. Men would suffocate during the night and their bodies would be taken out the following morning. The room behind the restaurant was known as \\"Mujo‚Äôs Room\\". The dimensions of this room were about and the average number of people detained there was 500, most of whom were Bosniaks. The women in the camp slept in the interrogations rooms, which they would have to clean each day as the rooms were covered in blood and pieces of skin and hair. In the camp one could hear the moaning and wailing of people who were being beaten. The detainees at Omarska had one meal a day. The food was usually spoiled and the process of getting the food, eating and returning the plate usually lasted around three minutes. Meals were often accompanied by beatings. The toilets were blocked and there was human waste everywhere. British journalist Ed Vulliamy testified that when he visited the camp, the detainees were in very poor physical condition. He witnessed them eating a bowl of soup and some bread and said that he had the impression they had not eaten in a long time; they appeared terrified. According to Vulliamy, the detainees drank water from a river that was polluted with industrial waste and many suffered from constipation or dysentery. No criminal report was ever filed against persons detained in the Omarska camp, nor were the detainees apprised of any concrete charges against them. Apparently, there was no legitimate reason justifying these people‚Äôs detention. Murder, torture, rape, and abuse of prisoners was common. Detainees were kept in inhumane conditions and an atmosphere of extreme psychological and physical violence pervaded the camp. The camp guards and frequent visitors who came to the camps used all types of weapons and instruments to beat and otherwise physically abuse the detainees. In particular, Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat political and civic leaders, intellectuals, the wealthy, and other non-Serbs who were considered \\"extremists\\" or to have resisted the Bosnian Serbs were especially subjected to beatings and mistreatment which often resulted in death. In addition, the Omarska and Keraterm camps also operated in a manner designed to discriminate and subjugate the non-Serbs by inhumane acts and cruel treatment. These acts included the brutal living conditions imposed on the prisoners. There was a deliberate policy of overcrowding and lack of basic necessities of life, including inadequate food, polluted water, insufficient or non-existent medical care and unhygienic and cramped conditions. The prisoners all suffered serious psychological and physical deterioration and were in a state of constant fear. Inmates were usually killed by shooting, beating or by the cutting of throats; however, in one incident, prisoners were incinerated on a pyre of burning tires. The corpses were then transferred onto trucks by other inmates or using bulldozers. There were instances where prisoners were brought to dig the graves and did not return. The ICTY Trial Chamber in the Stakiƒá case found on the basis of the evidence presented at trial, that \\"over 100\\" prisoners were killed at the camp in late July 1992. About 200 people from Hambarine brought to the camp in July 1992 were held in the building known as the \\"white House\\". In the early hours of 17 July, gunshots were heard that continued until dawn. Corpses were seen in front of the \\"white house\\" and camp guards were seen shooting rounds of ammunition into the bodies. A witness testified that \\"everyone was given an extra bullet that was shot in their heads\\". About 180 bodies in total were loaded onto a truck and taken away. The camp was closed immediately after a visit by foreign journalists in early August. On 6 or 7 August 1992, the detainees at Omarska were divided into groups and transported in buses to different destinations. About 1,500 people were transported on twenty buses. =Death toll= As part of the ethnic cleansing operations, the Omarska, Keraterm, Manjaƒça, and Trnopolje camps helped the Crisis Committee of the Serbian District of Prijedor to reduce the non-Serb population of Prijedor from more than 50,000 in 1992 to little more than 3,000 in 1995, and even fewer subsequently. Precise calculations about the number who actually died in these camps are difficult to make. Newsweek reporter Roy Gutman claimed that US State Department officials, along with representatives of other Western governments, told him that 4,000‚Äì5,000 people, the vast majority of them non-Serbs, perished at Omarska. Journalist Bill Berkeley puts the death toll at 2,000. A member of the United Nations (UN) Commission of Experts testified during the trial of Du≈°ko Tadiƒá at the ICTY that their number was in the thousands, but she could not be precise, despite the fact that Serbian officials confirmed there were no large scale releases of prisoners sent there. A member of the Crisis Committee, Simo Drljaƒça, who served as chief of police for Prijedor, has stated that there were 6,000 \\"informative conversations\\" (meaning interrogations) in Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje, and that 1,503 non-Serbs were transferred from those three camps to Manjaƒça, leaving 4,497 unaccounted for according to Human Rights Watch. According to the Association of Camp Detainess of Prijedor 1992, between May and August 1992, around 6,000 prisoners passed through Omarska, 700 of whom were killed. International reaction In early August 1992, Vulliamy, Independent Television News (ITN) reporter Penny Marshall, and Channel 4 News reporter Ian Williams gained access to the Omarska camp. Their reporting served as one of the catalysts of a UN effort to investigate war crimes committed in the conflict. The camp was closed less than a month after its exposure caused international uproar. =1997‚Äì2000 controversy= Between 1997 and 2000, there was academic and media controversy regarding the events that took place in Omarska and Trnopolje in 1992, due to claims of false reporting and \\"lies\\". These allegations, promoted by the state-controlled Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) and the British Living Marxism (LM) paper, prompted the ITN network to accuse the LM of libel; ITN won the case in 2000, effectively forcing the paper to close down. Trials The Republika Srpska officials responsible for running the camp have since been indicted and found guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes. * Commanders of the camp, Miroslav Kvoƒçka, Dragoljub Prcaƒç, Milojica Kos, and Mlaƒëo Radiƒá, and a local taxi driver, Zoran ≈Ωigiƒá were all found guilty of crimes against humanity. Kvoƒçka, Prcaƒç, Kos and Radiƒá were sentenced to five, six, seven and 20 years respectively; ≈Ωigiƒá was given the longest term of 25 years. * ≈Ωeljko Mejakiƒá was found guilty of crimes against humanity (murder, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution, and other inhumane acts). He was the de facto commander of Omarska and perpetrated one instance of mistreatment. It was found that he was part of a joint criminal enterprise with the intent of promoting mistreatment and persecution of detainees in the camp. He was sentenced to 21 years of imprisonment. * Momƒçilo Gruban was found guilty of crimes against humanity (murder, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution, and other inhumane acts). He had command responsibility for crimes committed at the camp and acted as part of a joint criminal enterprise. He was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. * Du≈°ko Kne≈æeviƒá was found guilty of crimes against humanity (murder, torture, sexual violence, persecution, and other inhumane acts). He was found to have been directly involved in the crimes carried out in the Omarska and Keraterm camps. He was also found guilty under the theory of joint criminal enterprise for furthering the Omarska and Keraterm camps‚Äô systems of mistreatment and persecution of detainees. He was sentenced to 31 years imprisonment. On 26 February 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) presented its judgment in the Bosnian Genocide Case, in which it had examined atrocities committed in detention camps, including Omarska, in relation to Article II (b) of the Genocide Convention. The Court stated in its judgment: > Having carefully examined the evidence presented before it, and taken note > of that presented to the ICTY, the Court considers that it has been > established by fully conclusive evidence that members of the protected group > were systematically victims of massive mistreatment, beatings, rape and > torture causing serious bodily and mental harm during the conflict and, in > particular, in the detention camps. The requirements of the material > element, as defined by Article II (b) of the Convention are thus fulfilled. > The Court finds, however, on the basis of evidence before it, that it has > not been conclusively established that those atrocities, although they too > may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, were committed with > the specific intent (dolus specialis) to destroy the protected group, in > whole or in part, required for a finding that genocide has been perpetrated. Exhumations Ed Vulliamy speaking at the 2006 Omarska camp commemoration In 2004, a mass grave located a few hundred meters from the Omarska site was unearthed containing the remains of 456 persons from the camp. \\"There is no doubt whatsoever that there are hundreds of bodies as yet unfound within the mine of Omarska and its vicinity\\" said Amor Ma≈°oviƒá, president of the Bosnian government's Commission for Tracing Missing Persons. The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has been active in advocating the exhumation and identification of their bodies from mass graves around the area; with their help, a number of victims have been identified through DNA testing. Memorial controversy The Mittal Steel company purchased the Omarska mining complex and planned to resume extraction of iron ore from the site. Mittal Steel announced in Banja Luka on 1 December 2005 that the company would build and finance a memorial in the 'White House' but the project was later abandoned. Many Bosnian Serbs believe there should not be a memorial, while many Bosniaks believe that construction should be postponed until all the victims are found and only if the entire mine‚Äîwhich is in use‚Äîbe allocated for the memorial site. By the time of the 20th anniversary of the camp's closure proposals for a physical memorial to the camp's existence had made no progress. ArcelorMittal said that it was prepared to meet the former inmates' demands but the local authorities were ultimately responsible for granting permission. The Republika Srpska authorities considered that allowing camp survivors free access to the site and the construction of a memorial as originally agreed by ArcelorMittal would undermine reconciliation. \\"Prijedor 92\\" president Mirsad Duratoviƒá, stated that the campaign for a memorial would continue. In July 2012, ahead of the start of the 2012 London Olympic Games, survivors of the camp laid claim to the ArcelorMittal Orbit tower, the tallest structure in Britain, located in the Olympic Park beside the Olympic stadium, as the 'Omarska Memorial in Exile'. The survivors allege that the Orbit is \\"tragically intertwined with the history of war crimes in Bosnia, as the bones of victims are mixed in with the iron ore\\". ArcelorMittal denied that material from Omarska had been used in the Orbit's construction. The company said that sensitive issues relating to the mine could not be addressed by ArcelorMittal on its own. Campaigners urged ArcelorMittal as the world's largest steel producer to use its considerable influence to oppose the local politics of denial and play an active role in healing fractured communities that have made the company's success possible. Susan Schuppli of the Centre for Research Architecture at Goldsmiths' College in London, observed that ArcelorMittal insistence on \\"not taking sides\\" in an area where persecution and injustice continued was not neutrality but taking a political position by default.

Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. Mariana Alley Griswold Van Rensselaer (February 21, 1851 ‚Äì January 20, 1934), usually known as Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer or M. G. Van Rensselaer, was an American author focusing on architectural criticism. Early life Mariana Alley Griswold was born in New York City on February 21, 1851. She was the daughter of George Griswold and Lydia (n√©e Alley) Griswold (1826‚Äì1908). Her younger brothers were Frank Gray Griswold (1855‚Äì1937), the stepfather of Cass Canfield, and George Griswold (1857‚Äì1917), the vice president and general manager of the Tuxedo Park Association. In 1868, she moved with her family to Dresden, Germany, where she remained for five years. Career She began writing in 1876. The first woman architectural critic, she grew in influence in the 1880s. However, her publications encompassed also art and landscape architecture criticism, fiction, and children's literature. She wrote articles in American Art Review, Century Magazine, and Garden and Forest (in which she wrote many unattributed articles) After refuting an offer to edit the American Art Review in 1881, she began writing for Century Magazine. She advocated that the public should view architectural works not as just the work of the individual firm owners, but the entire firm (particularly in reference to McKim, Mead, and White), and preferred architectural training at colleges for create intellectual and genteel architects, rather than the on-the-job training which was common at the time. Around 1890, Van Rensselaer garnered an honorary membership to the American Institute of Architects, and in 1920 to the American Society of Landscape Architects In 1910, she received the degree of D. Litt. from Columbia University, the accomplishment being an extraordinary one for a woman at that time. She was awarded the 1923 American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal. In 1915, in honor of deceased son, she donated a collection of reproductions of frescoes, vases, and other objects which illustrate the prehistoric culture of Greece to Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University. Van Rensselaer also served a number of charitable organisations, including University Settlement Women's Auxiliary (president from 1896-1898), Jacob A. Riis Neighborhood Settlement, and the New York Infirmary for Women and Children. She was president of the Public Education Association of New York from 1899-1906. Although she did vote in 1893 while living in Colorado, she later was involved with New York State Association Opposed to the Extension of Suffrage for Women. Personal life In 1873, she married Schuyler Van Rensselaer (1845‚Äì1884) of the prominent Van Rensselaer family. Together, they lived in New Brunswick, New Jersey. They had one child, born in February 1875, before her husband, a mining engineer, died in 1884. * George Griswold Van Rensselaer (1875‚Äì1894), who died before his twentieth birthday and was a member of Harvard University's class of 1896. Van Rensselaer died away while in New York City on January 20, 1934. She was buried next to her husband and only child at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

(The project was named after the MƒÅori-language name for the New Zealand swamp harrier.)  History  In 1986, the RNZAF initiated this project to improve the capabilities of its A-4K fleet. The upgrade included the installation of a Westinghouse AN/APG-66 radar optimized for maritime tracking, HOTAS controls and a 'glass' cockpit (2 large CRT screens), MIL-STD 1553B databus, Litton Industries LN-93 inertial navigation system, Ferranti 4510 wide-angle HUD, the Vinten airborne video recording system, the General Instrument ALR-66 radar warning receiver, and a Tracor ALR-39 chaff/flare dispenser. Parts of the wings were reskinned and some structural elements rebuilt, and the aircraft wiring replaced. Because of advances in miniaturization, it was possible to incorporate these additional electronics items entirely within the fuselage without requiring the use of the dorsal hump. The Kahu-modified Skyhawk could be recognized by a blade-like ILS aerial antenna on the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer. The aircraft also received armament upgrades including the capability to fire AIM-9L Sidewinders, AGM-65 Mavericks and GBU-16 Paveway II laser-guided bombs. The cost of the project was NZ$140 million and gave the RNZAF Skyhawks the electronic ‚Äúeyes and ears‚Äù of a modern fighter aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon or F/A-18 Hornet.  Aftermath  The RNZAF withdrew the Skyhawks from service in 2001 and they were put into storage awaiting sale. Draken International signed an agreement with the New Zealand government in 2012 to purchase eight McDonnell Douglas A-4K Skyhawks as well as various other equipment and accessories. The remaining aircraft were given to museums in New Zealand and Australia.

It derives its name from the duff, a percussion instrument made of wood and ox skin. The word duff is of Arabic origin and is also called a thappitta. Duffmuttu is performed as social entertainment and to commemorate festivals, uroos (festivals connected with mosques) and weddings. Duffmuttu can be performed at any time of the day. A duffmuttu performance usually consists of six members who stand or sit facing each other singing songs and swaying their bodies to the tempo of the song which is set by the rhythmic beats of the duff. Duffmuttu songs are a tribute to Islamic heroes and martyrs. The lead player also leads the troupe in song while the others provide the chorus. The dancers drum the duff with their fingers or palms and while moving rhythmically often toss them over their heads. A closely related art form is the Aravana Muttu or Arabana Muttu that uses a drum called arabana that is similar to the duff.

Audio restoration can be performed directly on the recording medium (for example, washing a gramophone record with a cleansing solution), or on a digital representation of the recording using a computer (such as an AIFF or WAV file). Record restoration is a particular form of audio restoration that seeks to repair the sound of damaged gramophone records. Modern audio restoration techniques are usually performed by digitizing an audio source from analog media, such as lacquer recordings, optical sources and magnetic tape. Once in the digital realm, recordings can be restored and cleaned up using dedicated, standalone digital processing units such as declickers, decracklers, dehissers and dialogue noise suppressors, or using digital audio workstations (DAWs). DAWs can perform various automated techniques to remove anomalies using algorithms to accomplish broadband denoising, declicking and decrackling, as well as removing buzzes and hums. Often audio engineers and sound editors use DAWs to manually remove \\"pops and ticks\\" from recordings, and the latest spectrographic 'retouching' techniques allow for the suppression or removal of discrete unwanted sounds. DAWs are capable of removing the smallest of anomalies, often without leaving artifacts and other evidence of their removal. Although fully automated solutions exist, audio restoration is sometimes a time-consuming process that requires skilled audio engineers with specific experience in music and film recording techniques. Overview The majority of audio restoration done today is done for music sound recordings and soundtracks for motion picture and television programs. The demand for restored audio has been fueled by new media consumer technologies such as CD and DVD. Modern audio reproduction systems require that sound sources be in the best condition possible to enhance the listening experience. Media content owners have come to recognize the importance of having clean sound on their products to enhance the commercial value of their media assets. The byproduct of these restoration efforts is that many audio sources are brought into the digital world and preserved for future use. An unfortunate fact is that most of the sound recordings and motion picture soundtracks created over the past century have been lost due to improper storage and neglect. Enhancements are often done to motion picture soundtracks. For example, taking a mono or stereo soundtrack and re-mixing it to a modern 5.1 surround soundtrack. When sources from original discrete audio \\"stems\\" containing dialog, music and sound effects are used and properly restored, the enhancements can be significant and highly effective. The annual Grammy Awards presents the award for Best Historical Album in recognition of restored recordings. Recent developments Two researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Drs. Vitaliy Fadeyev and Carl Haber have been experimenting with an audio restoration method that involves taking a very high definition digital photographic image of the vintage recording medium. They use a precision optical metrology system (designed to scan silicon detectors) to form an image of the groove on a 78 rpm record. After processing the digital file, they have an audio stream that represents the variations in the groove walls, allowing them to 'play' the record virtually without using a phonograph stylus. 2D images can be made more quickly and have proved worthy of further investigation on 78 rpm discs cut laterally. A 3D method is possible, though it takes much longer for the photographic survey of the recording and it requires much more storage space for the larger digital file. 3D methods are required for non-flat media such as \\"hill-and-dale\\" recordings (an early vertical cutting method by Path√©), Edison cylinders and Dictabelt rolls. 3D imaging is required for stereo phonograph records in order to capture the full detail of both inner and outer groove walls.Digitizing the voices of the past / Science perfects sound of century-old recordingsResearch News : From Top Quarks to the BluesDigitization for preservation analogue recordings In the summer of 2007, the U.S. Library of Congress moved their audio, video and film restoration group to Culpeper, Virginia where the newly completed National Audio-Visual Conservation Center Packard Campus is sited. Gene DeAnna heads the Recorded Sound Section. With 3 million sound recordings and many more film and video works that include synchronized sound in the archive, the mission of the Sound Section is twofold: preserve the treasure of vintage sound recordings and increase public accessibility to the collection. One of the ways that access can be increased is through the diligent digitization of analog media. The Library has expressed interest in the Fadeyev/Haber 2D imaging method for quick digital archival of their vast collection of vinyl and shellac phonograph records. Audio restoration tasks will take place in parallel with the digitization effort. A massive multi- petabyte storage array is nearing completion; it will hold the large digital audio and moving image files. Subjective issues Audio restoration is a subjective process, and there are many strategies or perspectives that the audio engineer or sound editor can employ. The archival perspective says that audio restoration should restore the recording to its original condition, while the commercial perspective says that the recording should be both restored and enhanced to appeal most immediately with modern audiences.

Beginning in 1980 on Spring Street in Los Angeles's Chinatown, it has grown to become one of the leaders in the Asian hot sauce market, particularly in Sriracha sauce popularly referred to as rooster sauce due to the image of a rooster on the label. Name and brand The company is named for a 400' Taiwanese-owned Panama registered freighter, Huey Fong, that carried the founder, David Tran, and 3,317 other refugees out of Vietnam in December 1978. The rooster symbol that is a part of the Sriracha branding comes from the fact that Tran was born in the Year of the Rooster on the Chinese zodiac. Products The company's most popular product is its sriracha sauce. It was originally made with Serrano peppers and is now made with red Jalape√±o peppers, reducing the overall pungency. It is currently Huy Fong Foods' best-known and best-selling item, easily recognized by its bright red color and its packaging: a clear plastic bottle with a green cap, text in five languages (Vietnamese, English, Chinese, French, and Spanish) and the rooster logo. One nickname for the product is \\"rooster sauce‚Äù, for the logo on the bottles.Once Secretive Sriracha Factory Becomes California's Hottest Tourist Attraction , Forbes, Sep 24, 2014 In contrast to similar hot sauces made by other manufacturers, Huy Fong's sriracha sauce does not contain fish extract, making it suitable for most vegetarians, although the presence of garlic may make it unsuitable for members of Buddhism and some Hindu denominations. Huy Fong also makes sambal oelek and chili garlic sauces. History =Founding and staffing= Huy Fong Foods was founded by David Tran (born 1945), a Chinese-Vietnamese businessman of Teochew descent, and a former Major in the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam. Tran fled the country in 1978 and arrived in the United States ‚Äî first in Boston, then in Los Angeles ‚Äî in the spring of 1980 as a part of the migration of the Vietnamese boat people following the Vietnam War. Huy Fong Foods is a family business, staffed by eight members of the family. David Tran's son, William Tran (born c. 1976), is the company's president; his daughter Yassie Tran- Holliday is vice-president. =Production= Huy Fong Foods Headquarters, Irwindale, California In 1987, Huy Fong Foods relocated to a building in Rosemead, California that once housed toymaker Wham-O. In 2010, the company opened a factory in Irwindale, California on 23 acres, a facility having of office space, of production space, and of warehouse space, which is now the site of manufacture of all three of the brands sauces. These sauces are produced on machinery that has been specially modified by David Tran, who taught himself machining and welding skills. Since 2014, the Irwindale factory has been open to visitors, and has become a tourist attraction. In Huy Fong Foods' production at these facilities, the company begins with purchase of chilis grown in Ventura, Los Angeles, and Kern counties and production of a mash from these; most of each year's chili mash is produced in just two months, during the autumn harvest. Earlier, the company used serrano chilis but found them difficult to harvest. The product made from the natural mash is processed such that the final product contains no artificial ingredients. Specifically, until 2016, the sauces were made from a Ventura County red jalape√±o mash made from chili peppers grown in Moorpark, California by Underwood Ranches, whose proprietor, Craig Underwood, also oversees Underwood Family Farms. Huy Fong Foods' relationship with Underwood and the Ranches ended in 2016 after‚Äîas alleged by a lawyer for Underwood‚ÄîHuy Fong Foods' David Tran \\"attempted... to hire away Underwood‚Äôs COO in order to form a new chile- growing concern\\", which is described as breaking trust between the supplier and manufacturer. After a failure by Underwood to return an overpayment in 2016, Huy Fong Foods' sued Underwood Ranches, who then \\"countersued for... breach of contract and later won\\". The company has never advertised its products, relying instead on word of mouth. Production and sales of the sauces are sizeable; in 2001, the company was estimated to have sold 6,000 tons of chili products, with sales of approximately US$12 million. In 2010 the company produced 20 million bottles of sauce in a year. As of 2012 it had grown to sales of more than US$60 million a year. The company has warned customers about counterfeit versions of its sauces. Awards and recognition In December 2009, Bon App√©tit magazine named its Sriracha sauce Ingredient of the Year for 2010. Community relations issues The odor of chilis that emanates from the new Irwindale factory upset the community's residents and the City of Irwindale filed a lawsuit against Huy Fong Foods in October 2013, claiming that the odor was a public nuisance. Initially, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge refused the city's bid to shut down the factory. but a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ordered the factory to essentially shut down on November 27, 2013, prohibiting all activities that could cause odors. Irwindale dropped the lawsuit on May 29, 2014, after intervention by the office of Governor Jerry Brown.

Ritual  He founded the Rifai Sufi Order. Rifai Ratheeb, which is performed at ritual festivals and homes. The ritual is performed to defeat incurable diseases and to fulfill the aspirations of the faithful. It is the pilgrimage of Shaykh Ahmad Rifai. However, no authentic source confirms this origin. The ritual involves piercing the body without pain, immunity to snake and fire and riding of wild animals. Piercing affects the tongue, the ear and the stomach. Knives and steel tools are used. Hymns known as Byths or Ratheebs are sung. (More than twenty such byths are used) The followers of the ritual believe that even though injuries are inflicted on the bodies of the performers by weapons, these do not cause pain or damage the body. They believe that since the ritual is performed by devotees who have received ijazath (permission) from their sheikh (deity), it will not cause injuries.

It aired from 1957 to 1969 in a weekday and Saturday morning timeslot. It was hosted by Hal Shaw (1925‚Äì1999), a local television personality who created and produced the show. The title character, Ranger Hal, is a fictional US Forest Service Ranger who was assigned to a national forest. He befriended various local animals (represented by puppets) including Oswald (or Ossie) the Rabbit, Dr. Fox, and Eager Beaver. Shaw voiced all the characters, but a staff of puppeteers animated them. Some of the puppeteers went on to greater fame, including Barry Levinson and Max Robinson. After the initial success of the show on WTOP, The Washington Post replicated the concept at their Jacksonville, Florida affiliate, WJXT Channel 4. The Ranger Hal Show ran from 1958 through 1969, starring Henry Baran (the stage name of Henry Baranek, 1927‚Äì1979). Running in a similar timeslot, it was popular with adults as well as children, and maintained good viewing numbers for nearly its entire run. When the original show ended in 1969, Hal Shaw was promoted to WTOP management. In 1977, he suffered from a brain aneurysm that left him permanently disabled. In 1985, the Forest Service made him an honorary Ranger. He retired to his farm near Great Falls, Virginia, where he died from cancer in 1999.

Savo said that Tesla took him to Buffalo, New York in 1931 and showed him a modified Pierce-Arrow car. Tesla, according to the story, had removed the gasoline engine from the car and replaced it with a brushless AC electric motor. The motor was said to have been run by a \\"cosmic energy power receiver\\" consisting of a box measuring about 25 inches long by 10 inches wide by 6 inches high, containing 12 radio vacuum tubes and connected to a antenna. The car was said to have been driven for about 50 miles at speeds of up to 90 mph during an eight-day period.Ford, R.A., _Space Energy Receivers : Power from the wheelwork of nature_ , Simplified Technology Service, Champaign, IL, 1993 \\"Information about an invention by Dr Nikola Tesla, which is said to have harnessed cosmic energy\\" pp. 31‚Äì37. The story has received some debate because the car's propulsion system is said to have been invented by Tesla. No physical evidence has ever been produced confirming that the car actually existed. Tesla did not have a nephew by the name of Peter Savo, and Tesla's grand-nephew William Terbo considers the Tesla electric car story to be a fabrication. A number of web pages exist that perpetuate this tale. Aside from this one exception, every other account of this purported demonstration automobile is based upon the Peter Savo story plus literary embellishment.

Early life and education Garcelon was born in Lewiston (in modern-day Maine, then a part of Massachusetts), to French Huguenot parents. Garcelon attended Monmouth Academy, Waterville Academy, and New Castle Academy. Garcelon taught school during the winter terms to help pay for his tuition. In 1836 Garcelon graduated from Bowdoin College, and in 1839 he graduated from the Medical College of Ohio in Cincinnati, Ohio, and then returned to Lewiston to practice. Garcelon co-founded the Lewiston Journal in 1847. He served in the Maine House of Representatives from 1853‚Äì54, 1857‚Äì58, and in the Maine Senate from 1855-56. Garcelon donated to Bates College to Lewiston in 1855 and served as an instructor and trustee at the College. His son, Alonzo Marston Garcelon, graduated from Bates in 1872 and went on to serve as Mayor of Lewiston from 1883 to 1884. He was elected as a Delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1856. Garcelon's medical partner, Dr. Edward H. Hill, founded Central Maine Medical Center. Civil War During the Civil War, Garcelon served in the Union Army as a Maine surgeon general. During the impeachment of Andrew Johnson after the War, Garcelon became disgusted with the Republican Party and their policy of \\"Radical Reconstruction\\" and became a Democrat. In 1871 he was elected mayor of Lewiston, and in 1879 he was elected Governor of Maine by the legislature, serving one term until 1880. During his term as governor, Garcelon oversaw the \\"Greenback\\" controversy, when he investigated alleged voter fraud and determined that the Democrats and not the Republicans had won a majority in the legislature. Senator James Blaine came to Augusta with a hundred armed men to protest the results, and Garcelon called out the state militia. Civil war was narrowly averted, thanks to the peaceful intervention of militia leader Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. In 1883 Garcelon was once again elected mayor of Lewiston. Garcelon died in Medford, Massachusetts, and was buried at Riverside Cemetery in Lewiston, Maine. Legacy and honors Garcelon Field at Bates College is named after Dr. Garcelon, as is the Alonzo Garcelon Society, which provides scholarships to Bates for local students.

It is located in the east coast, 425 miles (683 kilometres) east of the Cape of Good Hope. Algoa Bay is bounded in the west by Cape Recife and in the east by Cape Padrone. The bay is up to deep. The harbour city of Port Elizabeth is situated adjacent to the bay, as is the new Coega deep water port facility. History The Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias was the first European to reach Algoa Bay in 1488, where he planted a wooden cross on a small island now called St Croix or Santa Cruz island. He gave the bay a name meaning \\"Bay of the Rock\\", which was changed in Portugal to Bahia de Lagoa or Bay of the Lagoon, and which eventually became Algoa Bay.

Close inshore, near the new Ngquru harbour development at Coega, on the north- eastern outskirts of Port Elizabeth, is the St Croix group, consisting of a main island of that name and two lesser islets, Jahleel Island just off the Ngquru breakwater and Brenton Island on the seaward side. The second group consists of Bird, Seal and Stag Islands. All six islands and their adjacent waters are declared nature reserves and form part of the Addo Elephant National Park. The islands are closed to the public. Worthy of mention as an obstacle to navigation is Despatch Rock, due east of the Port Elizabeth suburb of Summerstrand. The rock, which is submerged at high tide, is marked with a light. Further south, about southwest of Cape Recife, the western starting point of the bay is Thunderbolt Reef. Though not in the bay, this hazard to navigation has claimed many ships carelessly entering or leaving. Thunderbolt Reef is submerged save for spring low tides and the surf crashing on it can be observed from the mainland. St. Croix group *St. Croix Island at is from the nearest land and rises to . The BirdLife fact sheet states the island is only above sea level. It adds that the island is rocky and ‚Äúsupports minimal vegetation‚Äù. The island runs along a northwest, southeast axis and is about wide at its broadest ‚Äì along the west coast. Its highest point is halfway along the north coast. *Brenton Island () is equally sparsely vegetated and is less than in elevation, and is roughly in size with a northwest-southeast orientation. It is to sea from the nearest point on the mainland and south of St. Croix. *Jahleel, at less than in height, is just over from the closest beach and less than that from Ngquru‚Äôs long eastern breakwater.

The island is just less than offshore. |} Bird Island group Vasco da Gama named this group of islands Ilh√©us Ch√¢os (low or flat islands). In 1755, the East Indiaman Doddington was wrecked here while underway from Dover to India. Most of the passengers and crew perished, but a few managed to make it to the islands where they were marooned for seven months until one of their number, a carpenter, was able to make a boat for them. The survivors subsisted primarily on fish, birds and eggs until they were able to reach land. The ship was carrying a significant quantity of gold and silver, some of which was illegally salvaged in more recent times. Bird Island was named by the survivors as they left the island in their boat. Bird Island (), Seal Island and Stag Island lie in close proximity some east of the St Croix group or due east of Port Elizabeth and from the nearest landfall at Woody Cape ‚Äì part of the Addo Elephant National Park. Bird Island has a lighthouse, erected in 1898 after a series of shipwrecks in the vicinity of the island. Doddington Rock, West rock and East Reef lie just South-West of the group of islands. At , Bird Island is the largest of the Algoa Bay islands ‚Äì according to BirdLife. It is relatively flat and rises to . Seal Island is in size and lies north of Bird Island. Stag Island is even smaller at and is north-west of Bird Island. \\"Much of the island group is covered by sparse growth of mixed vegetation dominated by the fleshy herb Mesembryanthemum (fig marigold/icicle plants). Tetragonia (Duneweed) and Chenopodium (Goosefoot) form localised thickets that provide cover for some seabirds,\\" the fact sheet says. Ecology =Bird and wildlife= The BirdLife fact sheet adds that 14 species of seabirds, several species of shorebirds and 33 species of terrestrial birds have been recorded on the islands. Eight seabird species were known to breed on the islands in 2007. ‚ÄúThese are the only islands off southern mainland Africa where Sterna dougallii (Roseate Tern) breeds regularly.‚Äù The islands are also home to 43% of the global population of the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), the majority of which are on St Croix. St Croix also holds a locally significant breeding population of Cape cormorant (Phalacrocorax capensis). Bird Island is one of only six breeding sites in the world for the Cape gannet (Morus capensis). ‚ÄúLarus dominicanus (the Kelp Gull) and Haematopus moquini (the African Oystercatcher) are found throughout the Algoa Bay complex. The island group is also known to hold large numbers of Sterna vittata (Antarctic Tern), which in winter roost on the island in their thousands (regularly holding between 10% and 20% of the estimated total Afrotropical non-breeding population).‚Äù The island is also home to Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus). Raggy Charters, the a licensed boat-based whale and dolphin watching tour in Algoa Bay can offer guests close-up encounters with the wildlife in the bay. Species which can be seen on the cruises are humpback whales, southern right whales, Bryde's whales, bottlenose dolphins, common dolphins, humpback dolphins, African penguins, African black oystercatchers, Cape gannets, Cape fur seals, Cape cormorants, white-breasted cormorants, various shark species and various pelagic birds including terns, skuas, petrels, shearwaters and albatrosses. =Conservation issues= The St. Croix group and a maritime zone around each island became South Africa‚Äôs island marine reserve in 1981 and were administered as part of the then-Woody Cape Nature Reserve. Up to then, the islands had fallen under the control of the Guano Islands section of the Division of Sea Fisheries. The Eastern Cape Nature Conservation service, which subsequently became the Directorate of Nature Conservation of the Eastern Cape Province, managed the islands after April 1992 according to BirdLife. The Woody Cape reserve was subsequently incorporated into the Addo National Elephant Park, which boasts that it is home to Africa‚Äôs ‚Äúbig seven‚Äù ‚Äì the elephant, lion, leopard, rhinoceros, buffalo and the whale and great white shark that inhabit the bay. Conservationists are wary of the Ngqura development which in time, in addition to a deep water port will include a heavy-industry complex. Mooted occupants include an aluminium smelter and an oil refinery. They see the development as posing, according to BirdLife: The NGO notes that the population of the African penguin in the bay has been increasing steadily during the last century. ‚ÄúThere are only a few growing colonies in the world, and it is thought that these birds may be relocating here from colonies that are in decline in the Western Cape or farther afield. Certain factors are known to affect seabirds throughout their ranges. Competition with commercial fisheries, especially purse-seining for surface- shoaling fish such as anchovy (Engraulis capensis) and pilchard (Sardinops sagax), has been implicated as one of the most significant factors causing seabird population declines.\\" The organisation has recommended that marine reserves with a radius of 25 km be created around important breeding islands, and that commercial fishing be banned or restricted in these zones. The fact sheet continues: ‚ÄúAn unpredictable threat, which is difficult to control, is chronic pollution by crude oil or other pollutants which spill into the ocean when tankers break open, wash their tanks, dump cargo or pump bilge. The African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is particularly susceptible to these events, and a single oil disaster has the ability to severely affect populations. It is believed that the breeding sites in Algoa Bay, at the eastern extremity of the species' range, are at highest risk as they are closest to the major oil-shipping routes.‚Äù See also *Kwaaihoek *Donkin Heritage Trail References External links Algoa Bay Nature Reserve Bays of South Africa Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality Maritime history of South Africa ","title":"Algoa Bay"},{"id":"4039307","text":"Cricoarytenoid muscles are muscles that connect the cricoid cartilage and arytenoid cartilage.

Generally, a lock-up period is a condition of exercising an employee stock option. Depending on the company, the IPO lock-up period typically lasts between 90‚Äì180 days before these shareholders are allowed the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the option. Lockups are designed to prevent insiders from liquidating assets too quickly after a company goes public. When employees and pre-IPO investors initially get their shares or options, they sign a contract with the company that typically prohibits trades for the first 90‚Äì180 days after a future IPO. When the company is ready to go public, the underwriting bank then reaffirms the existing agreements in new contracts. This helps to ensure the market will not disproportionately increase the supply, which drives prices downward. While lockups used to be simple‚Äîusually lasting 180 days for everyone‚Äîthey have become increasingly complex. Usually employees and early investors want shorter lockups (so they can cash out sooner) while the underwriting banks want longer ones (to keep insiders from flooding the market and sinking the share price).

Biography Jerome \\"Jerry\\" Namias was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the second son of Joseph Namias, an optometrist, and Sadie Jacobs Namias. He was raised in Fall River, Massachusetts. On graduation from high school, Namias was offered a four-year scholarship to Wesleyan University in Connecticut; however, because of his father's illness and the Great Depression, Namias decided to stay home and try to find a job to help his family out.\\" Biography of Jerome Namias He took correspondence courses, which allowed him to obtain employment in meteorology- related areas. Later he Namias studied at the University of Michigan for one year, then joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1936 as research assistant. In the 1930s he studied the phenomena of the Dust Bowl. In 1941 he received his Master's degree from MIT. From 1941 to 1971 he was Chief of the Extended Forecast Division of the U.S. Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service). In the 1940s he developed the 5-day-forecast, and month and season forecasts in the 1960s. Further, he was responsible for forecasting for the Allies during World War II in Northern Africa. Namias helped to develop the system of passenger flight weather forecasting, and researched the interaction between the oceans and atmosphere. He was involved in the research of the El Ni√±o phenomena in the Pacific Ocean and its relevance to the world climate. In 1971 he joined the Scripps Institution and established the first Experimental Climate Research Center. University of Californat at San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography His prognosis of warm weather during the Arab oil embargo of 1973 greatly aided domestic policy response. Education Namias attended public schools in Fall River, graduating from Durfee High School in 1928. He was offered a four-year scholarship to Wesleyan University, but due to the looming recession and his father's ill health, Jerome elected to remain home at that time. Shortly thereafter, he became infected with tuberculosis and was confined to his residence for several years. During that time he took several correspondence courses, including courses in meteorology, from Clark University. Although he never received an undergraduate degree, he eventually received a Master's degree in Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1941). He also later received honorary Ph.D's from University of Rhode Island (1972) and from Clark University (1984). While working at the National Weather Service in Washington D.C., Namias entered into correspondence with the head of the newly established meteorology department at MIT, Carl-Gustaf Rossby. At Rossby's urging, Namias enrolled as an undergraduate student at MIT in 1932. However, in 1934 he left MIT to work in the nascent forecasting bureau of Trans-World Airlines in Newark and then in Kansas City, where he stayed until 1934. That job was canceled in 1934 when TWA lost a government airmail contract, and Namias \\"was happy to return to part-time work at MIT and Blue Hill Observatory, even though he had to learn to live on student pay once again.\\" John O. Roads, Jerome Namias; March 19, 1910 ‚Äì February 10, 1997 (The National Academies Press) In 1934 Namias had determined to obtain a college degree, and had enrolled in the University of Minnesota, which had lower tuition than MIT. However, he had serious health problems (pleural effusion) during that year, and he returned to Fall River, to continue his self-education. While in Fall River he published a seminal paper on atmospheric inversions (1936), which again impressed Dr Rossby, who offered Namias a graduate assistantship at MIT, beginning with the 1936 Fall term. He continued working and studying at MIT, receiving an M.S. degree in 1941. The University of Rhode Island granted Namias an honorary D.Sc., in 1972; Clark University followed with a similar bestowal in 1984.Roads Career in meteorology After recovering from tuberculosis in the early 1930s, Namias sought employment in the field of meteorology. One petition, to H. H. Clayton at the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, resulted in a job offer. Namias was hired after a face-to-face interview which included an exercise in extracting predictions from meteorological data, and he was sent to the weather bureau in Washington, D.C.. He was put to work compiling world weather records and solar weather studies. In the NWS library, Namias discovered the scientific reports issued by Carl G. Rossby's new department of meteorology at MIT. He wrote Rossby, questioning some of the papers' assertions. Rossby, surprisingly, soon responded, acknowledging that part of Namias's assertions were indeed correct, and inviting Namias to come visit him. Rossby had major influence on Namias. He arranged a job for Namias, taking and analyzing data from the research aircraft instruments used by the department at the East Boston Airport. Sometimes, Namias's work entailed fourteen-hour days, which included tracking balloon runs with the help of a theodolite to determine wind directions and speeds at various altitudes. In 1934 Rossby suggested that Namias take a job in the rapidly expanding airline industry, with its desire to establish meteorological departments. He began working for Trans World Airlines, first at Newark and then at Kansas City, forecasting for transcontinental flights. However, TWA had to temporarily downsize after losing a lucrative government airmail contract, and Namias was unemployed. By this time he was known as an expert forecaster. He gave advice to Auguste Piccard in connection with Piccard's record-setting high-altitude balloon flights. He assisted helped out at the national gliding and soaring contest in New York, where Dupont made a distance record for the United States by using Namias's forecast of a strong frontal passage to glide all the way to Boston. In 1936 Namias returned to work and study at MIT, working with and under Dr Rossby. Rossby had just begun working on his theory of long waves on the westerlies and was trying to convince people of its validity. One of the main difficulties in applying Rossby's ideas involved the lack of data aloft, particularly over the oceans. At Rossby's suggestion, Namias constructed a trial upper-level map by judicial extrapolations, estimating quantitatively the flow patterns aloft over the North Atlantic, as well as the United States. Namias was later one of the unnamed contributors to Rossby's 1939 seminal paper. While at MIT, Namias was a proponent of isentropic analyses. A 1938 paper on the subject resulted in his receiving the first Meisinger Award of the American Meteorological Society in 1938. He was also part of an MIT team devoted to developing reliable methods for long-range weather forecasts (up to a week out). The group's work caught the attention of the US military as World War II began unfolding, and in 1941 Namias was asked to take a one-year leave of absence from MIT to head the forecasting effort in Washington, D.C. The one-year leave of absence stretched on, while Namias supervised a seminal sea- level mapping effort, taught future military pilots and civilian forecasters at several training centers, and made extended predictions for several large- scale military offensives. He received a citation from Navy Secretary Frank Knox for his sea-state forecasts for the North African invasion. Namias also made forecasts for favorable periods for the transfer of disabled vessels to other ports for repair; estimates of the likely course of incendiary balloons from Japan; favorable and unfavorable conditions for the possible invasion of Japan; and certain aspects of the meteorology for bombing raids. Dr Rossby returned to Sweden after the war to found the International Institute of Meteorology, and invited Namias to Stockholm. He used his time there to investigate variations in upper airflow patterns. He and colleague Phil Clapp issued a 1949 paper describing asymmetric variations in the upper-level winds, and in 1950 he issued a notable study of the index cycle. By 1953 Namias felt enough confidence in his five-day prediction procedures to begin extending them to thirty days. He also began issuing advisory statements about hurricane probabilities a month in advance. This led to his receipt of the 1955 Award for Extraordinary Scientific Achievement, the highest accolade given by the American Meteorological Society. In 1955 Namias also received the Rockefeller Public Service Award, which made it possible for him to spend a year studying at his choice of locale. He used this stipend to return to Stockholm. He documented his studies in papers explaining the influence of land and snow on atmospheric movements. A 1955 paper explored the possibility that the soil moisture in the Great Plains of the United States played an important role in the Great Plains drought by varying the heat input to the overlying atmosphere. Namias was invited to speak at the 1957 Rancho Santa Fe CalCOFI (California Cooperative Fisheries) conference of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He gave a standard talk about anomalous mid-altitude events, and then sat back to listen to the other speakers. A remarkable oceanic warming (now called El Ni√±o) had recently occurred over the eastern Pacific. Southern fish were being caught in northern waters; unusual typhoons were observed; the atmosphere and ocean were not acting normally. This drastic switch in normally-observed weather caught Namias's attention, and he thereafter began to draw on the influence of the ocean surface in his weather studies. However, it was several years later before he could devote himself to unraveling the phenomenon. His mentor Rossby and his best friend and brother-in-law Harry Wexler were gone, both from heart failure, and he also had a heart attack in 1963. In 1964 he was involved in an automobile accident in Boston. Growing tired of all the budget battles, he submitted his retirement from the Weather Service in 1964. Namias left NWS, but moved to Scripps to continue his investigations. In 1981 Namias received the Sverdrup Gold Medal of the American Meteorological Society for his pioneering efforts on air-sea interactions. Personal Namias married Edith Paipert in 1938. They had one child, Judith. He was survived by his wife, daughter and grandchildren when he died in La Jolla, California due to complications of a stroke which left him partially paralyzed and unable to speak or write (1989), and of pneumonia (1997). During his long and intense career, Namias never learned to drive a car. He was always driven by fellow workers, students or family members. Richard C.J. Somerville, Atmospheric Science at Scripps: The Legacy of Jerome Namias, Oceanography, Vol. 16 No. 3 (2003) Awards and honors Namias received many honors and awards, including election into the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Apology, 33d-e Historians call him Aeschines Socraticus‚Äî\\"the Socratic Aeschines\\"‚Äîto distinguish him from the more historically influential Athenian orator also named Aeschines. His name is sometimes but now rarely written as Aischines or √Üschines Aeschines and Socrates According to Plato, Aeschines of Sphettus was present at the trial and execution of Socrates.Plato. Apology 33e, Phaedo 59b. We know that after Socrates' death, Aeschines went on to write philosophical dialogues, just as Plato did, in which Socrates was main speaker. Though Aeschines' dialogues have survived only as fragments and quotations by later writers, he was renowned in antiquity for his accurate portrayal of Socratic conversations. According to John Burnet, Aeschines' style of presenting Socratic dialogue was closer to Plato's than Xenophon's.Platonism (1928), chap. II. (Some modern scholars believe that Xenophon's writings are inspired almost entirely by Plato's and/or by the influence of other Socratics such as Antisthenes and Hermogenes.e.g., Charles Kahn, Plato and the Socratic Dialogue, pp. 76-79 & 393-401 On the other hand, there is no good reason to think that Aeschines' writings were not based almost entirely on his own personal recollections of Socrates.)  Socratic dialogues  According to Diogenes La√´rtius, Aeschines wrote seven Socratic dialogues:Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, ii. 61 *Alcibiades (not to be confused with either Platonic dialogue of the same name) *Aspasia *Axiochus (not to be confused with the dialogue of the same name erroneously included in the Platonic corpus) *Callias *Miltiades *Rhinon *Telauges Of these, we have the most information about the Alcibiades and the Aspasia, and only a little about the others. The Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedia compiled a dozen centuries later, ascribes to Aeschines several other works called \\"headless\\" or \\"Prefaceless\\" (akephaloi): Phaidon, Polyainos, Drakon, Eryxias, On Excellence, The Erasistratoi, and The Skythikoi.\\"Œë·º∞œÉœáŒØŒΩŒ∑œÇ\\". Suda. Adler number: alphaiota,346 Few modern scholars believe these other works were written by Aeschines.\\"It is generally agreed that the Suidas' testimony concerning the [akephaloi] is not trustworthy\\" (D. E. Eichholz, \\"The Pseudo-Platonic Dialogue Eryxias\\", The Classical Quarterly, Vol. 29, No. 3. (1935), pp. 129-149 at pp. 140-141). The 2nd century AD sophist Publius Aelius Aristides quotes from the Alicibiades at length, preserving for us the largest surviving chunk of Aeschines' written work. Just before World War I, Arthur Hunt recovered from Oxyrhynchus a papyrus (#1608) containing a long, fragmentary passage from this dialogue that had been lost since ancient times.John Burnet, Platonism (1928), chap. II. In the dialogue, Socrates converses with a young, ambitious Alcibiades about Themistocles and argues that Alcibiades is unprepared for a career in politics since he has failed to \\"care for himself\\" in such a way as to avoid thinking that he knows more than what he actually knows on matters of the most importance. Socrates seems to argue for the view that success is directly proportional to knowledge (though knowledge may not be sufficient for complete success), as opposed to being dependent merely on fortune or divine dispensation, independent of knowledge. Socrates' arguments cause the usually cocky Alcibiades to weep in shame and despair‚Äîa result also attested to by Plato in the Symposium. Socrates claims that it is only through loving Alcibiades that he can improve him (by cultivating in him a desire to pursue knowledge?), since Socrates has no knowledge of his own to teach. Our major sources for the Aspasia are Athenaeus, Plutarch, and Cicero. In the dialogue, Socrates recommends that Callias send his son Hipponicus to Aspasia to learn politics. In the dialogue, Socrates argues, among other things, that women are capable of exactly the same military and political \\"virtues\\" as are men, which Socrates proves by referring Callias to the examples of Aspasia herself (who famously advised Pericles), Thargelia of Miletus (a courtesan who supposedly persuaded many Greeks to ally themselves with Xerxes who in turn gave Thargelia part of Thessaly to rule), and the legendary Persian warrior-queen Rhodogyne. (The doctrine is likewise found in Plato's Meno and Republic, and so is confirmed as genuinely Socratic.) A certain Xenophon is also mentioned in the dialogue‚ÄîSocrates says that Aspasia exhorted this Xenophon and his wife to cultivate knowledge of self as a means to virtue‚Äîbut this Xenophon may not be the same Xenophon who is more familiar to us as a historian and another author of Socratic memoirs. In the Telauges, Socrates converses with the Pythagorean ascetic Telauges (a companion of Hermogenes who was Callias' half-brother and a follower of Socrates) and Crito's young son Critobulus. In the dialogue, Socrates criticizes Telauges for his extreme asceticism and Critobulus for his ostentatiousness, apparently in an attempt to argue for a moderate position. The Axiochus‚Äînamed after Axiochus, the uncle of Alcibiades‚Äîcriticized Alcibiades for being a drunkard and a womanizer. Evidently, it was, like the Alcibiades, one of the many works that the Socratics published to clear Socrates of any blame for Alcibiades' corruption. In the Callias, there is a discussion of the \\"correct use\\" of wealth; it is argued that how one holds up under poverty is a better measure of virtue than how well one makes use of wealth. In the dialogue, Prodicus is criticized for having taught Theramenes. The setting of the Miltiades is the stoa of Zeus Eleutherios. The dialogue is between Socrates, Euripides, Hagnon (stepfather of Theramenes), and Miltiades son of Stesagoras. This Miltiades is not to be confused with Miltiades the Younger, but is probably a close relative of his. The dialogue contains an encomium to Miltiades for having had an exemplary training and education in his youth, perhaps in contrast to the kind of education offered by sophists like Protagoras.  Anecdotes  Diogenes La√´rtius, in his brief Life of Aeschines, reports that Aeschines, having fallen into dire financial straits, went to the court of Dionysius the Younger in Syracuse and then returned to Athens after Dionysius was deposed by Dion. (If this is true, Aeschines must have lived at least until 356, which would mean that he probably died of old age in Athens, as he was likely not less than 18 at the time of Socrates' trial in 399.) He is also said to have practised rhetoric, writing speeches for litigants.Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 2.60-64 Athenaeus quotes a passage from a lost prosecution speech, ghosted by Lysias, Against Aeschines, in which Aeschines' adversary chastises him for incurring a debt while working as a perfume vendor and not paying it back, a turn of events that is surprising‚Äîthe speaker alleges‚Äîgiven that Aeschines was a student of Socrates and that both of them spoke so much of virtue and justice. Among other charges, Aeschines is basically characterized as a sophist in the speech. (We gather that the litigation in question was one brought by Aeschines himself against his lender for reasons that are not made clear in Athenaeus' quotation.)Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, xiii. 611-612. Diogenes La√´rtius claims that, contrary to Plato's Crito, it was Aeschines rather than Crito who urged Socrates after his trial to flee Athens rather than face his sentence; Diogenes says that Plato puts the arguments into Crito's mouth because Plato disliked Aeschines due to his association with Aristippus.Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 2.60 But Diogenes' source for this is Idomeneus of Lampsacus, a notorious scandalmonger. From Hegesander of Delphi (2nd century CE)‚Äîvia Athenaeus‚Äîwe hear of the scandal that Plato stole away Aeschines' only student Xenocrates. But Hegesander is notoriously unreliable, and the story is entirely uncorroborated. There is no other evidence of Aeschines' having a \\"philosophy\\" of his own to teach or any followers of his own. Scholarship The extant fragments and quotations concerning Aeschines were collected by the German scholar Heinrich Dittmar.Heinrich Dittmar. Aischines von Sphettos. 1912 That collection has been superseded by the Italian scholar Gabriele Giannantoni's work on Socratic writings.Gabriele Giannantoni.Socratis et Socraticorum Reliquiae. 1991 English translations are hard to find.

George Sanford Becker (February 19, 1922 - April 9, 1996), who was known professionally as Sandy Becker, was an American television announcer, actor, and comedian who hosted several popular children's programs in New York City. The best known of these was The Sandy Becker Show, which ran from 1955 to 1968 on Channel 5 WABD-TV and WNEW-TV. Radio actor and announcer Sandy Becker was born and raised in New York City. He held local radio announcing jobs before first reaching public fame in 1947 on radio as the title character of the series Young Doctor Malone, a role he was invited to take to television in 1958, but declined to pursue his own television projects. Originally a pre-medical student at New York University in the 1930s, Becker played the good doctor on the radio for a decade, after having been the show's announcer. Children's TV host Soon, he started working for WABD (later WNEW) TV-Channel 5 and began hosting a program featuring Bugs Bunny cartoons, The Looney Tunes Show, on weeknights from 1955 to 1958. A second Friday night program called Bugs Bunny Theater ran from 1956 to 1957. Becker also did television announcing, such as for Wildroot Cream-Oil ads in the television series The Adventures of Robin Hood. He did radio spots for Crisco, as well.Advert, \\"Remember the Golden Days of Radio, Volume 1\\", SY-5183, Longines Symphonette Society, Larchmont, New York, circa 1970. In the middle of those activities, Becker found his true calling, spun in large part off from his knack for entertaining his own 3 children, with his vocal and comic versatility and mimicry. This led him to his morning show, beginning in 1955. He soon added a noontime program, Sandy Becker's Funhouse, briefly in 1955. He also hosted the first year of the syndicated children's Sunday TV show Wonderama, from its six-hour premiere in September 1955, until 1956. The Sandy Becker Show Becker would also host a weekday afternoon and evening children's wraparound program, The Sandy Becker Show, which had him playing comedic characters, performing puppet skits, engaging his viewers in informational segments and contests, and interviewing guest performers and personalities in-between the reruns of movie and TV cartoons. The Sandy Becker Show was seen weekday afternoons and evenings from Monday, March 30, 1961, to Friday, February 16, 1968. The show also ran on Saturday evenings, from March 27, 1961 to September 4, 1965. Becker's propensity for doing comic voices brought him much work in animation. His best-known work there was perhaps Mr. Wizard on King Leonardo and His Short Subjects ‚Äî \\"Drizzle, drazzle, druzzle, drome / Time for this one to come home\\" ‚Äî who was always indulging, then rescuing Tooter Turtle from his outlandish wishes. Becker also provided the voices for Sergeant Okie Homa and Ruffled Feathers on Go Go Gophers. The former character sounded similar to John Wayne, while the latter simply exploded into babbling gibberish whenever he explained his latest idea to stop the coyote adversaries. On his morning and (later) afternoon children's programs, Becker created such characters as double-talking disc jockey Hambone, the addled, but brilliant Big Professor (who claimed to know the answer to every question in the world), rumpled Hispanic kid's show host K. Lastima, incompetent mad scientist Dr. Gesundheit, and ‚Äî showing a remarkable knack for silent comedy ‚Äî simple-minded Norton Nork, whose routines of earnest bumbling were joined only by musical accompaniment and a droll Becker narration that ended, invariably, with, \\"That's my boy, Norton Nork ‚Äî you've done it again!\\" He also had a real bird in a cage called \\"Chipper\\". Another aspect of Becker's humor was derived from his interaction with his (often ethnically stereotyped) hand puppets, which included; Marvin Mouse, Googie, the German-accented Geeba Geeba, the English Sir Clive Clyde, Wowee the Indian, the space creature Sputnik, the Latino K. Lastima (the name taken from the Spanish phrase \\"¬°Qu√© l√°stima!\\" {\\"What a pity\\"}), and the Irish Danny Moran. Becker's show was so popular in the New York area, that when he began using a version of the Hambone theme music from an old 78 rpm record by Red Saunders, which was recorded in 1952, Okeh Records re-released the song on a 45 rpm record; it reached survey position #22 on local rock radio station WMCA in March 1963. For the morning show's own theme music, Sandy came to use Guy Warren's \\"That Happy Feeling\\" as recorded in 1962 by Bert Kaempfert. (The evening show used \\"Afrikaan Beat\\" also by Kaempfert.) Becker also created a puppet known as Henry Headline, who delivered lighter news to the children who watched. Becker was quoted in an early 1960s interview in 'Long Island Press\\", as saying it was better to introduce children to news listening on a lighter note; \\"the impact of a major news story might be lost to them, or it might even frighten them. They'll learn about wars and international crises soon enough. I try to keep the news as light as possible. Occasionally I'll use an item that has historical value.\\" In spite of this view ‚Äî or perhaps because of it ‚Äî Becker is warmly remembered for the manner in which he handled one of America's deepest tragedies on the air. On November 22, 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Becker went on the air and, quite movingly, attempted to explain to his young viewers what had happened. Later years and death Sadly, most of Becker's programs were not preserved. Most aired live and were not kinescoped or videotaped; they live on only in the memories of those who watched them. However, some clips are surfacing on the Internet. After withdrawing from on-camera hosting in 1968, Becker helped other children's shows create puppets and characters, and he became known as a mentor to new generations of children's hosts. \\"I never treated them as though they were in swaddling clothes,\\" he said many years later of his young viewers. \\"Most kid shows regard young viewers as babies. I wanted to treat them as their parents might if they were on TV.\\" In April 1996, seven weeks past his 74th birthday, Becker died following a heart attack at his home in the Long Island hamlet of Remsenburg. Personal life In 1942, when he was 20 years old, Sandy Becker was working as an announcer at North Carolina AM radio station WBT in Charlotte. He met Charlotte native Ruth Venable when she visited the station and married her on July 20. The following year, Becker returned with his wife to New York where they became the parents of Joyce, Curtis and Annelle. He was survived by his second wife, Cherie, whom he married in 1980, and his three children.

Glen Tilt (Scottish Gaelic: Gleann Teilt) is a glen in the extreme north of Perthshire, Scotland. Beginning at the confines of Aberdeenshire, it follows a South-westerly direction excepting for the last 4 miles, when it runs due south to Blair Atholl. It is watered throughout by the Tilt, which enters the Garry after a course of 14 miles, and receives on its right the Tarf, which forms some beautiful falls just above the confluence, and on the left the Fender, which has some fine falls also. The attempt of George Murray, 6th Duke of Atholl to close the glen to the public was successfully contested by the Scottish Rights of Way Society in 1847https://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst3824.html. The massive mountain of Beinn a' Ghl√≤ and its three Munros C√†rn nan Gabhar (1129 m), Br√†igh Coire Chruinn-bhalgain (1070 m) and C√†rn Liath (975) dominate the glen's eastern lower half. Marble of good quality is occasionally quarried in the glen, and the rock formation has long attracted the attention of geologists. One of the earliest was James Hutton, who visited the glen in 1785 and found boulders with granite penetrating metamorphic schists in a way which indicated that the granite had been molten at the time. This showed to him that granite formed from cooling of molten rock, contradicting the ideas of Neptunism of that time that theorised that rocks were formed by precipitation out of water. Hutton concluded that the granite must be younger than the schists.

Aside from Independent Lens, ITVS funded and produced films for more than 40 television hours per year on the PBS series POV, Frontline, American Masters and American Experience. Some ITVS programs are produced along with organizations like Latino Public Broadcasting and KQED. Besides Independent Lens, ITVS series include Indie Lens Storycast on YouTube and Women of the World with Women and Girls Lead Global. Prior series include Global Voices (on World) and FutureStates. ITVS is funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), and is based in San Francisco. ITVS has funded more than 1,400 films, with an eye on diversity and underrepresented audiences and filmmakers. The organization champions inclusion on the screen and behind the camera: Nearly 70% of ITVS funds go to diverse producers, 50% to women. History ITVS was established through legislation by the United States Congress in 1988, ‚Äúto expand the diversity and innovativeness of programming available to public broadcasting,‚Äù and began funding new programming via production licensing agreements in 1990. From 2005-2010, it expanded its reach through the creation of the Global Perspectives Project, which facilitated the international exchange of documentary films made by independent producers. In 2017, ITVS was named the recipient of a Peabody Institutional Award for its contributions to storytelling in television; the Peabody board of jurors cited \\"an accomplished range of work as rich as any broadcaster or funder,\\" and in the same year the organization learned it was to receive the 2017 Emmy Governors Award chosen by the Television Academy Board of Governors, awarded during the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony on Saturday, September 9, 2017. ITVS has discovered and nurtured prominent filmmakers, including one of the first films by Oscar- winning director Barry Jenkins, who made a film.

This was a big disadvantage when any of the media standards were changed. Since media processors are software programmed devices, the processing done on them could be updated with new software releases. This allowed new generations of systems to be created without hardware redesign.

The player controls Zeke, a zookeeper, attempting to rescue his girlfriend Zelda from a zoo where the animals have escaped from their cages. The majority of the game takes place on a screen where the player builds a wall to keep animals in the zoo--jumping them to avoid contact. Platforming segments are interspersed every few levels. The game was available as a conversion kit for Taito's Qix. Zoo Keeper was not ported to contemporary home systems, but some development work was done on an unfinished Atari 2600 version. Gameplay Zoo Keeper has three different types of stages. In the zoo stage, Zeke must run around the edges of the screen to build up the zoo's outer wall and keep the animals from escaping as they try to break through it from inside. Each of these stages is timed, with items appearing periodically that can be picked up for bonus points. One item is always a net; if Zeke picks this up, he can use it for a few seconds to capture animals and put them back in the cage. Multiple nets appear in later zoo stages. When time runs out, the player earns bonus points for every animal that is not outside the wall perimeter. Points are also earned for jumping over animals. After every second zoo stage, the player enters a stage in which the goal is to maneuver Zeke from the bottom of the screen to a platform at top center, where Zelda is tied to a tree. All platforms except the top one scroll across the screen, some carrying bonus items; the player scores points for moving from one level to another (up or down), grabbing items, and touching Zelda to rescue her. At the same time, a monkey throws down coconuts that bounce among the platforms and must be avoided. After every platform stage except the first, the player enters a bonus stage with several escalators and a cage in front of each one. Zeke must cross the screen to get to each escalator, jumping over both the animals running toward him and the cage itself. Zelda waits for him at the top of the last escalator; if he reaches her, the player earns an extra life. The first bonus stage has two escalators, the second one has three, and all subsequent bonus stages have four. If Zeke touches an animal without holding a net, is hit by a coconut, or falls off the bottom edge of the screen, one life is lost and the player must replay the current stage from the beginning. Any built-up walls on the zoo stages will remain in place from one life to the next. Development The initial design, from Keith Egging, was for a game about a crab that interacted with eggs and tadpoles that emerged from the eggs. The game evolved based on programmer John Morgan's ideas. Legacy Zoo Keeper was re-released in the 2005 Taito Legends collection for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows. The game's main character, Zeke, later appeared in a family friendly version of Taito's mechanical game Ice Cold Beer called Zeke's Peak. In this game, Zeke is a mountain climber instead of a zookeeper.

The original widget was patented in Ireland by Guinness. The \\"floating widget\\" is found in cans of beer as a hollow plastic sphere, approximately 3 cm in diameter (similar in appearance to a table tennis ball, but smaller) with at least one small hole and a seam. The \\"rocket widget\\" is found in bottles, 7 cm in length with the small hole at the bottom. Background Draught Guinness, as it is known today, was first produced in 1959. With Guinness keen to produce draught beer packaged for consumers to drink at home, Bottled Draught Guinness was formulated in 1978 and launched into the Irish market in 1979. It was never actively marketed internationally as it required an \\"initiator\\" device, which looked rather like a syringe, to make it work. Method Some canned beers are pressurized by adding liquid nitrogen, which vaporises and expands in volume after the can is sealed, forcing gas and beer into the widget's hollow interior through a tiny hole‚Äîthe less beer the better for subsequent head quality. In addition, some nitrogen dissolves in the beer which also contains dissolved carbon dioxide. Oxygen is generally excluded as its presence can cause flavour deterioration. The presence of dissolved nitrogen allows smaller bubbles to be formed, which increases the creaminess of the head. This is because the smaller bubbles need a higher internal pressure to balance the greater surface tension, which is inversely proportional to the radius of the bubbles. Achieving this higher pressure would not be possible with just dissolved carbon dioxide, as the greater solubility of this gas compared to nitrogen would create an unacceptably large head. When the can is opened, the pressure in the can quickly drops, causing the pressurised gas and beer inside the widget to jet out from the hole. This agitation on the surrounding beer causes a chain reaction of bubble formation throughout the beer. The result, when the can is then poured out, is a surging mixture in the glass of very small gas bubbles and liquid. This is the case with certain types of draught beer such as draught stouts. In the case of these draught beers, which before dispensing also contain a mixture of dissolved nitrogen and carbon dioxide, the agitation is caused by forcing the beer under pressure through small holes in a restrictor in the tap. The surging mixture gradually settles to produce a very creamy head. Development British Patent No 1266351, filed 27 January 1969 Diagram of Acorn Can In 1969 two Guinness brewers at Guinness's St James's Gate Brewery in Dublin, Tony Carey and Sammy Hildebrand, developed a system for producing draught type Guinness from cans or bottles through the discharge of gas from an internal compartment. It was patented in British Patent No 1266351, filed 27 January 1969, with a complete specification published 8 March 1972. Development work on a can system under Project ACORN (Advanced Cans Of Rich Nectar) focused on an arrangement whereby a false lid underneath the main lid formed the gas chamber (see diagram below right). Technical difficulties led to this approach being put on hold, and Guinness instead concentrated on bottles using external initiators. Subsequently, Guinness allowed this patent to lapse and it was not until Ernest Saunders centralised the company's research and development in 1984 that work restarted on this invention, under the direction of Alan Forage. Development sequence for canned draught Guinness Development sequence for bottled draught Guinness The design of an internal compartment that could be readily inserted during the canning process was devised by Alan Forage and William Byrne, and work started on the widget during the period 1984‚Äì85. The plan was to introduce a plastic capsule into the can, pressurise it during the filling process and then allow it to release this pressure in a controlled manner when the can was opened. This would be sufficient to initiate the product and give it the characteristic creamy head. However, Tony Carey observed that this resulted in beer being forced into the widget during pressurisation, which reduced the quality of the head. He suggested overcoming this by rapidly inverting the can after the lid was seamed on. This extra innovation proved successful. The first samples sent to Dublin were labelled \\"Project Dynamite\\", which caused some delay before customs and excise would release the samples. Because of this the name was changed to Oaktree in recognition of the earlier ACORN project. Another name that changed was \\"inserts\\"; the operators called them \\"widgets\\" almost immediately after they arrived on site, a name that has now stuck with the industry. The development of ideas continued and more than one hundred alternatives were considered. The blow-moulded widget was to be pierced with a laser and a blower was then necessary to blow away the plume created by the laser burning through the polypropylene. This was abandoned and instead it was decided to gas-exchange air for nitrogen on the filler, and produce the inserts with a hole in place using straightforward and cheaper injection- moulding techniques. Commissioning began January 1988, with a national launch date of March 1989. This first-generation widget was a plastic disc held in place by friction in the bottom of the can. This method worked fine if the beer was served cold; when served warm the can would overflow when opened. The floating widget, which Guinness calls the \\"Smoothifier\\", was launched in 1997 and does not have this problem. The diagrams on the left show the development sequences for canned and bottled draught Guinness from 1969 to 1988. The idea for the widget soon became popular. John Smith's started to include widgets in their cans in 1994 and many beer brands in the UK now use widgets, often alongside regular carbonated products. Although patented by Guinness, the widget was actually invented by John Lunn, MD of Mclennons of Birmingham, who went on to invent a second for Whitbread and Heineken, so that Whitbread could launch Draught Boddingtons in a can and Murphy's. Lunn then later invented a third widget, the floating one, with two one-way valves, which is the widget that all brewers use now. Beer glass widget Circular widget etched in the base of a standard pint glass Comparison of bubbles formed in a glass containing a widget (left) and one with a smooth base (right). The term widget glass can be used to refer to a laser-etched pattern at the bottom of a beer glass which aids the release of carbon dioxide bubbles. The pattern of the etching can be anything from a simple circular or chequered design to a logo or text. The widget in the base of a beer glass works by creating a nucleation point, allowing the CO2 to be released from the liquid which comes into contact with it, thus assisting in maintaining head on the beer. This has become increasingly popular with Fosters, Estrella and others using them in public houses in the UK.

Five years in the making, it was the most expensive nature documentary series ever commissioned by the BBC and also the first to be filmed in high definition. The series received multiple awards, including four Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, and an award from the Royal Television Society. Planet Earth premiered on 5 March 2006 in the United Kingdom on BBC One, and by June 2007 had been shown in 130 countries. The original version was narrated by David Attenborough, whilst some international versions used alternative narrators. The series has eleven episodes, each of which features a global overview of a different biome or habitat on Earth. At the end of each fifty-minute episode, a ten-minute featurette takes a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges of filming the series. Ten years later, the BBC announced a six-part sequel had been commissioned, titled Planet Earth II, the first television series produced by the BBC in Ultra-high-definition (4K). David Attenborough returned as narrator and presenter. A second sequel, Planet Earth III is currently announced and planned to air in 2022. Background In 2001 the BBC broadcast The Blue Planet, a series on the natural history of the world's oceans. It received critical acclaim, high viewing figures, audience appreciation ratings, and many awards. It also became a hugely profitable global brand, eventually being sold to 150 countries worldwide. Feedback showed that audiences particularly liked the epic scale, the scenes of new and unusual species and the cinematic quality of the series. Programme commissioners were keen for a follow-up, so Alastair Fothergill decided that the Natural History Unit should repeat the formula with a series looking at the whole planet. The idea for Planet Earth was born, and the series was commissioned by Lorraine Heggessey, then Controller of BBC One, in January 2002. A feature film version of Planet Earth was commissioned alongside the television series, repeating the successful model established with The Blue Planet and its companion film, Deep Blue. Earth was released around the world from 2007 to 2009. There was also another accompanying television series, Planet Earth: The Future, which looked at the environmental problems facing some of the species and habitats featured in the main series in more detail. Broadcast Planet Earth premiered on BBC One on 5 March 2006 in the United Kingdom. On the same day or in the subsequent weeks or months, the series also began airing in several other countries. International broadcasters carrying Planet Earth include Australia on ABC and GEM, Canada on CBC and CTV, New Zealand on Prime, the Philippines on GMA Network and GMA News TV, the U.S. on Discovery Channel and Velocity and Science and Animal Planet and Destination America and BBC America. =British television= The episodes are each an hour in length, comprising the main programme and a 10-minute featurette called Planet Earth Diaries, which details the filming of a particular event. In the UK, Planet Earth was split into two parts, broadcast in spring and autumn 2006. The first five episodes premiered on BBC One at 9:00 pm on Sundays, beginning on 5 March 2006. The programmes were repeated the following Saturday in an early evening slot on BBC Two. Along with its 2005 dramatisation of Bleak House, the BBC selected Planet Earth for its trial of high-definition broadcasts. The opening episode was its first-ever scheduled programme in the format, shown 27 May 2006 on the BBC HD channel. The first episode in the autumn series, Great Plains, received its first public showing at the Edinburgh International Television Festival on 26 August 2006. It was shown on a giant screen in Conference Square. The remaining episodes were broadcast from 5 November 2006 in the same primetime BBC One slot, following a further repeat run of the spring programmes on BBC Four. The autumn episodes were broadcast simultaneously on BBC HD and were repeated on BBC Four the following week. Besides being BBC One's featured One to Watch programme of the day, Planet Earth was heavily trailed on the BBC's television and radio channels both before and during its run. The music that was featured in the BBC trailers for the series is the track \\"Hopp√≠polla\\" from the album Takk... by Icelandic post-rock band Sigur R√≥s. Following the advertisements, interest was so widespread that the single was re-released. In the United States, the series was promoted using \\"The Time Has Come\\" from trailer music company Epic Score,Epic Score composed by Gabriel Shadid and Tobias Marberger. The Australian trailers initially used Jupiter: The Bringer of Jollity from Gustav Holst's orchestral suite The Planets, but later reverted to \\"Hopp√≠polla\\". =International= The BBC pre-sold the series to several overseas broadcasters, including the Discovery Channel for the United States, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, China Central Television, WDR for Germany, Discovery Channel for India, Prime Television for New Zealand, and C1R for Russian broadcasts. The series was eventually sold to 130 countries.Radio Times: 4‚Äì10 November 2006 On 25 March 2007, the series began its run on American television on the Discovery network, premiering on the Discovery Channel and Discovery HD Theater. There were a number of revisions to the original British programme. Actress and conservationist Sigourney Weaver was brought in to replace David Attenborough as narrator, as it was thought her familiarity to American audiences would attract more viewers. The Discovery programmes also used a slightly different script to the British original. The series was broadcast on Sundays in one 3-hour block followed by four 2-hour blocks. The Planet Earth Diaries segments were not shown immediately after each episode, but collectively in Planet Earth: The Filmmakers' Story, a two-hour special which was broadcast after the series had finished its initial network run. Edited versions were later broadcast on The Science Channel, Animal Planet, and Planet Green. In Canada, the series did not air on the Canadian Discovery Channel, as it is owned by CTV and the Canadian rights were exclusively sold to the CBC. Episodes Planet Earth: The Future The latter episodes were supplemented by Planet Earth: The Future, a series of three 60-minute films that highlight the conservation issues surrounding some of the featured species and environments. The programmes are narrated by Simon Poland and the series producer was Fergus Beeley. The series began transmission on BBC Four after the ninth episode, \\"Shallow Seas\\". Feature film Alongside the commissioning of the television series, BBC Worldwide and GreenLight Media secured financing for a US$15 million film version of Planet Earth. This followed the earlier success of Deep Blue, the BBC's 2003 theatrical nature documentary which used re-edited footage from The Blue Planet. The film was co-directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield and produced by Alix Tidmarsh and Sophokles Tasioulis. Only 30% of the footage shown in Earth is new, with the remainder being reworked from the television series to suit the narrative of the film. David Attenborough was replaced as narrator by high-profile actors: Patrick Stewart for the UK market and James Earl Jones for the United States. Earth had its worldwide premiere in September 2007 at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival in San Sebasti√°n, Spain, in Basque Country. Lionsgate released the film in several international markets over the following year. In the United States, it became the first film to be released by Disneynature, the Walt Disney Company's new nature documentary arm. When released on Earth Day 2009 it set the record for the highest opening weekend gross for a nature documentary, and went on to become the third highest grossing documentary of all time. It has grossed more than $108 million worldwide; in the nature documentary genre, only March of the Penguins has achieved greater box-office success. Reception =Critical reception= Planet Earth received widespread critical acclaim. Time magazine's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 New TV Series of 2007, ranking it at No. 4. In 2019, Planet Earth and its sequel were ranked 72nd on The Guardian's list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century. =Accolades= Jeff Hasler at the 67th Annual Peabody Awards for Planet Earth Planet Earth: From Pole to Pole won the Science and Natural History award at the Royal Television Society Programme Awards in 2007. The RTS also awarded it a Judge's Award and a Photography Award at its Craft and Design Awards. The series picked up two awards from the Broadcasting Press Guild for Best Documentary Series and Innovation in Broadcasting, and won Best Documentary Series at the 2007 Broadcast Awards. At the 2007 BAFTA Television Awards, Planet Earth was nominated in the Specialist Factual and Pioneer Audience Award categories, but lost out to Nuremberg: Goering's Last Stand and Life on Mars respectively. It received three nominations at the BAFTA Television Craft Awards later the same year. George Fenton's original score won him Soundtrack Composer of the Year at the 2007 Classical BRIT Awards. Planet Earth was also nominated for the NTA for Most popular Factual program but lost to Top Gear (Supernanny and Bad Lad's Army: Officer Class were also nominated). Planet Earth was recognised by the American television industry, collecting the award for Nonfiction Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards in September 2007 and winning a further three prizes in technical categories at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards. It also collected two awards from the Television Critics Association in Los Angeles in July 2007 and a Peabody Award in April 2008.67th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2008. The series was also f√™ted at wildlife film festivals around the globe, collected multiple prizes at the Wildscreen Festival 2006, the International Wildlife Film Festival 2007 and the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival 2007. =Audience response= The credentials of the filmmakers, the size of the production, a high-profile marketing campaign and a primetime BBC One timeslot all resulted in Planet Earth attracting large audiences when it debuted in the UK in March 2006. The first episode, \\"From Pole to Pole\\", was watched by more people than any natural history programme since Attenborough and Fothergill's previous series, The Blue Planet, in 2001. The first five episodes drew an average audience of 11.4 million viewers, including the early evening repeats, outperforming even The Blue Planet. When the series returned to British screens after a six-month break, it remained popular but viewing figures did not reach the same levels. The final six episodes attracted an average audience of 6.8 million viewers, appreciably lower than the spring episodes, but still higher than BBC One's average for the timeslot. The BBC's 2007 Annual Report revealed that the series \\"received the highest audience appreciation score of any British programme on TV this year\\". In the United States, Planet Earth drew equally impressive ratings when it premiered on Discovery and Discovery HD Theater on 25 March 2007. The first three episodes (screened back to back) averaged 5.72 million viewers with a peak of 6.07 million viewers, giving the network its third highest audience ever. It was also the most watched Discovery programme since The Flight That Fought Back in 2005. Sequel In February 2016, the BBC announced a six-part sequel had been commissioned, titled Planet Earth II, for release in late 2016, with Sir David Attenborough returning as narrator and presenter. As with the 2006 series, the trailer features the track 'Hoppipolla' by Icelandic group Sigur Ros. Merchandise The popularity of the television series around the world translated into strong sales of associated Planet Earth merchandise. In the United States, it became the fastest and bestselling documentary DVD in Discovery Channel's history, and the high-definition (HD) discs generated US$3.2 million in sales in just two months. By the end of 2007, U.S. sales had topped 3 million units, making it the highest-grossing HD title and one of the top ten DVD titles of the year. In addition, the brand was licensed to other companies to produce children's books, calendars, a board game, jigsaws, stationery, cards, and more. =DVD= A five-disc DVD box set of the complete series (BBCDVD1883) was released in the UK for Regions 2 and 4 (PAL) on 27 November 2006 by 2 entertain. It is presented in 5.1-channel Dolby Digital surround sound and 16:9 widescreen video. The bonus features include Planet Earth Diaries (presented immediately after each episode as for the original TV broadcast) and Planet Earth: The Future. In the United States, two versions of the same five-disc set were released as a Region 1 (NTSC) DVD on 24 April 2007. The BBC Warner release retained David Attenborough's narration from the original British television broadcasts, but the Discovery Channel edition used the alternative Sigourney Weaver voice-over. Even in the United States the Attenborough version was much the better for sales. =HD DVD and Blu-ray= Except for a small amount of extremely hard-to-obtain footage,This information can be found on the back of the American HD boxed sets Planet Earth was filmed entirely in high-definition, and consequently became one of the first television series to take advantage of the new HD disc formats. The series was released in both Blu-ray and HD DVD formats as a five-disc Region B box set on 12 November 2007. On the fifth disc, the bonus features from the standard- definition DVD set were replaced by two episodes from the BBC's Natural World series, \\"Desert Lions\\" and \\"Snow Leopard: Beyond the Myth\\", both also presented in high-definition. In the United States, the series was released as a four-disc set in both high-definition formats, the Blu-ray version on single-layer BD-25 discs and the HD DVD set on dual-layer HD DVD-30 discs. The first U.S. high-definition releases omitted the extra disc of bonus features from the standard-definition boxed set, though these extras were included with new material in a special-edition Blu-ray released in 2011. =Books= Four official tie-in volumes were published by BBC Books in 2006 and 2007: *Planet Earth: As You've Never Seen It Before, written by Alastair Fothergill with a foreword by David Attenborough, was published in hardback on 5 October 2006 (). *The paperback title Planet Earth: The Future was also published on 5 October 2006 (). It was edited by Fergus Beeley and Rosamund Kidman Cox with a foreword by Jonathon Porritt. *A second paperback volume revealed some of the tales from the field during filming expeditions. Planet Earth: The Making of an Epic Series was written by David Nicholson-Lord and published on 9 March 2006 (). *A collection of still images from the series was published in a hardcover volume as Planet Earth: The Photographs on 7 October 2007 (). =Soundtrack album= On 20 November 2006, a two-disc soundtrack CD was released with a compilation of the incidental music specially commissioned for Planet Earth. The award-winning score was composed by George Fenton and performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra and has been performed during \\"Planet Earth Live\\" events in the United States and the United Kingdom.

In addition to working together with other people, social facilitation also occurs in the mere presence of other people. Previous research has found that individual performance is improved by coaction, performing a task in the presence of others who are performing a similar task, and having an audience while performing a certain task. An example of coaction triggering social facilitation can be seen in instances where a cyclist's performance is improved when cycling along with other cyclists as compared to cycling alone. An instance where having an audience triggers social facilitation can be observed where a weightlifter lifts heavier weight in the presence of an audience. Social facilitation has occasionally been attributed to the fact that certain people are more susceptible to social influence, with the argument that personality factors can make these people more aware of evaluation. The Yerkes-Dodson law, when applied to social facilitation, states that \\"the mere presence of other people will enhance the performance in speed and accuracy of well-practiced tasks, but will degrade in the performance of less familiar tasks.\\"Kirby, L. (2011, March 17). Group Processes. Lecture presented to Social Psychology Course at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. Compared to their performance when alone, when in the presence of others they tend to perform better on simple or well-rehearsed tasks and worse on complex or new ones. The audience effect attempts to explain psychologically why the presence of an audience leads to people performing tasks better in some cases and worse in others. This idea was further explored when some studies showed that the presence of a passive audience facilitated the better performance of a simple task, while other studies showed that the presence of a passive audience inhibited the performance of a more difficult task or one that was not well practiced, possibly due to psychological pressure or stress. (See Yerkes‚ÄìDodson law.)  History  Social facilitation can be defined as a tendency for individuals to perform differently when in the mere presence of others. Specifically, individuals perform better on simpler or well-rehearsed tasks and perform worse on complex or new ones. In relation to this, there are three main empirical relationships which are the activation, evaluation, and attention theories. The activation theory describes how we are physiologically aroused and how that affects our functioning. The evaluation theory relates to the systematic assessment of the worth or merit of some object. The attention theory takes into account possession in the mind including focalization and concentration of consciousness. In 1897, Triplett studied the effect on performance of having an audience. Triplett's experiment had a simple design; a cyclist's performance when alone was compared with a cyclist's performance when racing against another cyclist. He found that the cyclist was slowest when he was only racing the clock and not another cyclist. He attributed these results to a competitive instinct which releases energy that was not available when pedaling alone. Triplett's study started off a revolution of studies attempting to examine the theory that people's performance is influenced by the presence of others. In 1898, while studying the competitive nature of children, he found that children were much faster at completing their given activity (winding string) while they were competing, which caused him to wonder whether or not simply having another individual there would have the same effect. To determine this, Triplett studied the race time of cyclists and found that cyclists had faster race times when in the presence of other cyclists. He theorized that the faster times were because the presence of others made individuals more competitive, and further research led Triplett to theorize that the presence of others increases individuals' performances in other noncompetitive situations as well. In 1924, Floyd Allport, coined the term social facilitation. Allport conducted studies in which participants sat either alone or with other participants and did a variety of tasks such as word association tasks and multiplication assessments. He found that people performed better when in a group setting than when alone for the majority of tasks. However, at this time, social facilitation simply meant an \\"increase in response merely from the sight or sound of others making the same movement.\\" Hazel Markus of the University of Michigan conducted an experiment to test the hypothesis that the mere presence of others can influence an individual's performance. A task that lacked a rubric structure and was likely to cause the subject to be apprehensive of how they would be evaluated was used. Performance times on the task of dressing and undressing in familiar and unfamiliar clothing were compared with subjects working alone, working in the presence of a passive inattentive person, and working in the presence of an attentive spectator. Compared to the alone condition, both social conditions (audience and incidental audience) enhanced performance on the well-learned aspects of the task of dressing and undressing with the subject's own familiar clothing and hindered the subject's performance on the more complex aspects of the task of dressing and undressing using unfamiliar clothing. It was concluded that the presence of others is a sufficient condition for social facilitation and social interference effects. Therefore, the presence of an audience causes an individual to do better on a simple task or worse on a more complicated task. In a 2010 study, donation rates increased with the presence of observers, and neuroimaging revealed that the presence of observers significantly affected activation in the ventral striatum before the choice of whether or not to donate. In Raefeli's meta-analysis of the social facilitation phenomenon in 2002, three conclusions are made. Firstly, the presence of others heightens an individual's physiological arousal only if the individual is performing a complex task. Moreover, the mere presence of others increases the speed of simple task performance and decrease the speed of complex task performance. Lastly, social facilitation effects are surprisingly unrelated to the performer's evaluation apprehension. A study was done in 2014 that compared the performance of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to typically developing (TD) individuals on a task with the presence of another. The experiment conducted tested the hypothesis that an individual with ASD, will respond to the presence of experimenters, thus altering the results of the experiment.  Major theoretical approaches  The major three approaches to social facilitation are the activation, evaluation, and attention theories. The activation theory describes how our arousal relates to social facilitation. The evaluation theory discusses how being assessed by an audience affects to social facilitation. The attention theory takes into account the effect of distractions in the environment on social facilitation. = Activation theory = In 1956, Robert Zajonc was trying to figure out why some studies showed people's performance being hindered by the presence of others rather than being made more accurate. He designed an experiment that would examine the performance of someone doing a simple vs. complex task in front of others. He found that, when people were performing a simple task in the presence of others, they could complete it with greater accuracy than when they were alone. This was something most psychologists were aware of at this time. However, what Zajonc found that was revolutionary in this time period was that, when people attempt to perform tasks which are more complex or with which they are not familiar, they complete it with less accuracy when in the presence of others than when they alone. Thus, social inhibition was born. In 1965, Robert Zajonc developed the stern activation theory, by proposing his generalized drive hypothesis for social facilitation. Zajonc's generalized drive hypothesis was the first theory that addressed why the presence of others increased performance sometimes yet decreased it at other times. He argued that the presence of others serves as a source of arousal, and heightened arousal increases the likelihood of an organism to do better on well-learned or habitual responses. For this reason, arousal improves performance on simple, or well-learned tasks, but impairs performance on complex, or not well-learned tasks. Zajonc's reasoning was based on the Yerkes-Dodson law, which holds that performance works like an inverse \\"U\\" function. This means that an individual's optimal drive is higher for simpler, or well-practiced tasks, and that the same individual's optimal drive is lower for more complex, or less-practiced tasks. The presence of other people further arouses us and increases our drive level, and so an individual's performance will be enhanced if a task is simple (because of the high levels of energy) but diminished if the task is complex. He tested his theories by having people complete word association tasks alone and again in the presence of others, and found that the tasks were done much faster while in the presence of others. Other activation theories include the alertness hypothesis, the monitoring hypothesis, and the challenge and threat hypothesis.  Alertness hypothesis  The alertness hypothesis says that people are uncertain of how observers will act while in the presence of others, so they become more alert (because the performer will be uncertain about how the observers will act in the situation). It is this heightened alertness which causes them to perform better on tasks.  Monitoring hypothesis  The monitoring hypothesis posits that social facilitation effects do not occur when the performer is familiar with the observers or the situation. This is because, in those cases, the performer knows how the observer will respond or how the situation will take place. Therefore, in such situations the performer's arousal will not increase. So, if the person is unfamiliar with the observers or the situation, he/she will experience uncertainty and arousal will increase, but not if he/she is familiar with them.  Challenge and threat hypotheses  The challenge and threat hypothesis states that people perform worse on complex tasks and better on simple tasks when in the presence of others because of the type of cardio- vascular response to the task. When performing a simple task in the presence of others, people show a normal cardiovascular response. However, when performing a complex task in the presence of others, the cardiovascular response is similar to that of a person in a threatening position. The normal cardiovascular response serves to improve performance, but the threat-like cardiovascular response serves to impede performance. = Evaluation approach = In 1968, Henchy and Glass proposed the evaluation approach to social facilitation. Their evaluation apprehension hypothesis states that it is not the mere presence of others that increases individual activation/arousal, but rather the fear of being evaluated by an audience. They studied the reactivity of male high school and college students, where their responses were based on the strength they developed through prior training, and found that the groups who felt their performance was being evaluated had more dominant responses than the groups who were simply in the presence of an audience without being evaluated, or those that were alone.  Evaluation Apprehension Theory  In 1972, Nickolas Cottrell came up with Evaluation Apprehension Theory. This theory also explains the evaluative pressure as the source of increased productivity in presence of others rather than the arousal response identified by Zajonc. The theory assumes that people learn from experience that the source of most reward and punishments are other people they interact with. Therefore, people associate social situations with evaluation and hence, feel apprehensive in presence of other people. The evaluation apprehension improves performance on simple tasks but is debilitating in more complex and difficult tasks.  Self-presentation Theory  Self-presentation theory is another evaluation approach to social facilitation. The theory posits that social facilitation is a product of people's motivation to maintain positive self image or face in presence of others. This motivation leads people to behave in ways to form good impressions and therefore results in social facilitation in evaluative situations. In situations that were non evaluative or less evaluative, social facilitation effects were often eliminated. In addition, when individuals were more confident, they performed better in evaluative situations in presence of others as compared to working alone.  Learned drive hypothesis  A further extension of the evaluation approach is the learned drive hypothesis, which was developed by Cottrell, Wack, Sekerak, and Rittle, and states that activation only increases when actors feel that the audience is capable of evaluating their performance. In other words, it implies that the cause of evaluation apprehension comes from a learned audience. They studied how a participant performed on well-learned tasks while in the presence of an audience focused on another event, and in the presence of an audience focused on the tasks being performed. They found that participants performing in the latter group, with the audience that was focused on what the participants were doing, largely gave dominant responses. Weiss and Miller furthered developed the evaluation approach by hypothesizing that activation only increases when the actors fear a negative evaluation. This theory suggests that activation increases when the audience or other competitors cause negative feelings, such as anxiety, in the actor. However, Good's development of evaluation apprehension takes the opposite approach, where he hypothesizes that activation increases when actors expect a positive evaluation. Because of the conflicting theories under the evaluation approach, there has been controversy over its reliability. A meta-analysis done by Bond found that even when individuals are in the presence of a non-visible or non- evaluative audience, activation still occurs for an increase in dominant responses. = Social Orientation Theory = Social orientation theory of social facilitation suggests that people differ in their orientation toward social situations and that these individual differences predicts who will show social facilitation or impairment in performance. The theory states that individuals with positive orientation are more likely to display social facilitation effects whereas individuals with negative orientation are likely to experience impairment in performance. Those with positive orientation are individuals who are self confident and who react positively to challenges. The theory states that these individuals find \\"safety in numbers\\". On the other hand, individuals with negative orientation are defined by characteristics such as low self esteem, inhibited and feeling threatened by presence of other people. = Attention approach = In the 1980s, explanations shifted from activation theories to attention theories, which imply that withdrawal from some things is necessary in order to deal effectively with others. Attention theories that explain social facilitation include the distraction-conflict hypothesis, the overload hypothesis, the feedback-loop model, and the capacity model.  Distraction-conflict Theory  In his distraction-conflict theory, Robert Baron proposed that the level of performance on a task is predicted by the amount of distractions in the environment surrounding the task. The theory states distraction can be a source of social facilitation on simple tasks, as it can cause attentional conflict that can increase motivation which increases the drive proposed by Zajonc. On more complex and difficult tasks, however, the increase in drive is not enough to counteract the detrimental effects of distraction and therefore results in impaired performance. Distraction as the source of social facilitation is demonstrated in Stroop task, a color and word association task. In Stroop task, participants are shown a color name word, printed in different color and the participants job is to provide the color of the word that the word is printed in. The reaction time is slower and more errors arise when the word and color of the word does not match. However, when the task is completed with other people, these errors decrease. In these situations the presence of others may help by narrowing the focus of attention.  Overload hypothesis  The overload hypothesis works according to the distraction-conflict hypothesis, saying that distracters do not lead to increased arousal, but rather to cognitive overload (when an individual is bombarded with excessive information in their working memory),\\"Cognitive overload ¬∑ Foviance.\\" Foviance ¬∑ customer experience, usability, web analytics, accessibility & user research consultancy based in London, UK. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2011 and while in cognitive overload, individuals will do worse on complex tasks and better on more simple tasks. Performance increases on simple tasks because the performers focus their attention on the new stimuli, instead of the irrelevant stimuli that is characteristic of simple tasks. Performance decreases on complex tasks because the performers focus on the distracters, but also need to focus on the relevant stimuli that are characteristic of complex tasks, and they cannot handle all of the information they are being presented with.  Feedback-loop model  The feedback-loop model postulates that when people feel they are being observed, they focus attention on themselves. While in this state, individuals become aware of the differences between their actual behavior and anticipated behavior. So, by feedback-loop model, people do better in the presence of others because of this increased awareness about their behavior.  Capacity model  The capacity model of social facilitation focuses on the role of types of information processing on performance in front of an audience, rather than the performance on different type of tasks (simple or complex) in front of an audience. The capacity model suggests that for tasks that require automatic information processing, the presence of others does not cause problems because the short-term memory is not required for automatic information processing, so performance quality increases. However, for tasks that require controlled information processing, the presence of others does impede the level of performance because the short- term memory is necessary to both focus attention on the audience, as well as the task at hand. = Self-presentation approach = The self-presentation approach to social facilitation has two main theories: one regarding arousal or drive, and one without. The first theory argues that in the presence of an audience, individuals become concerned with self-presentation. The possible embarrassment that occurs with negative evaluation leads to activation of arousal, or increased drive which will cause more dominant effects. The second theory argues that it is not an issue of arousal, but rather of simple responses, because the individual wants to appear competent in the presence of others. If the task is easy, the individual will want to make him/herself appear even more competent by doing exceptionally well on the task. However, if the task is difficult, they will fear that they will present themselves as incompetent, which will in turn make them embarrassed, and further impede their performance. However, there has not been significant research done or evidence supporting the self-presentation approach. The main study looking at this approach was done by Bond in 1982, but it did not include independent measures of self-presentation, so it was not able to conclusively prove the validity of this approach.  Major empirical findings  = Age = In 1898, Norman Triplett pioneered research on social facilitation by studying the competitive nature of children. In this study, each child was given a string and was told to wind it. He found that children performed much better while they were competing with one another, and further research led Triplett to theorize that the presence of others increases individuals' performances in other noncompetitive situations as well. In 1973, Chapman ran an experiment and found that levels of laughter among 7‚Äì8 year-old children were highest when two children listened to funny material together (coaction condition). Furthermore, levels of laughter were higher when one child listened to funny material in the presence of another child (audience condition) than when one child listened to the funny material alone (alone condition). These results indicate that laughter is also socially facilitated. = Prejudice = Prejudice is often considered as easily learned and performed response. Therefore, following the logic of Zajonc's drive theory of social facilitation, prejudice then, is also likely to be socially facilitated. That is, individuals may be more likely to express prejudicial views in presence of others than in private. = Gender = In 1994, De Castro demonstrated that social facilitation affects food intake by extending the time spent eating a meal. His results also showed that the presence of family and friends, in comparison with the presence of mere companions, increases food intake to a greater degree, possibly due to the \\"release of inhibitory restraints on intake\\" that occurs when people feel more comfortable around people they are familiar with. Furthermore, males ate 36% more food when with other people than when alone, and females ate 40% more food when with other people than when alone. De Castro attributes this to the time-extension model of social facilitation, as the time spent at a meal increased when the meal was a social occasion. These results suggest that the presence of other people at a meal increases intake by extending the time spent at the meal, probably as a result of social interaction, and that family and friends have an even larger effect, probably by producing relaxation and a consequent disinhibition of restraint on intake. Furthermore, these results also suggest that social facilitation has very similar effects on both men and women. = Performance = In 1920, when asked to write out as many words as possible in response to a given word, 93% of participants produced more words in the presence of another person than alone. However, when this study was replicated with individuals who stuttered when they spoke, 80% of the participants produced more words when alone rather than in the presence of another person. Lee Edward Travis conducted a study to find what kind of effect an audience has on an individual. Travis used an eye‚Äìhand coordination test (holding a flexible pointer on a revolving target) for his study. Twenty freshmen males, one sophomore male, and one junior male were used as the subjects. The small audience consisted of four to eight upper classmen and graduate students and was an equal number of men and women. Each observer practiced in the presence of the experimenter, and their learning curve was plotted each day. When the subject attained his maximum efficiency, the passive audience was brought in. Some of the subjects showed superior coordination when the audience was present. In June 1980, Forgas et al. conducted a field study of audience effects, looking at the performance of expert and novice squash players when observed by no audience, a male audience, and a female audience. Contrary to Zajonc's drive-arousal theory, it was found that the effect of an audience on performance did not differ significantly between novice and expert players. This indicates that the other factors, such as cognitive variables and players' interpretation of the audience's presence, also influence players' reactions to the presence of an audience in a natural setting. In 1982, people playing pool were being surreptitiously watched in order to identify skilled and unskilled players. Skilled players made at least two-thirds of their shots whereas unskilled players missed at least two-thirds of their shots. When the observer moved closer to the pool table and continued to watch, skilled players' performance improved by 14% and the unskilled players' performance dropped by more than 30%. In 2007, Rosenbloom et al. studied archival data from Jerusalem in 2004 and found that the presence of an additional person in the car during a driving license test decreased the likelihood that the testee would pass the driving test. Although the nature of the study made it impossible to distinguish one explanation of social facilitation from another, the findings generally support the basic premise of social facilitation theory. In 2008, college students were given a list of words and told to copy them as quickly as they could. The \\"easy task\\" was to write out one list with their dominant hand and the \\"hard task\\" was to write out another list with their nondominant hand. While completing the task, they were in the presence of an image of their favorite television personality (displayed on a computer screen) or an image of another character from the same show. When given the easy task, they wrote more words in the presence of their favorite character and when given the hard task, the favorite character inhibited their performance. As shown, while the college students were given tasks, their favorite television characters are perceived as \\"real\\" in a social facilitation paradigm which gives evidence as to how social facilitation can affect performance. In 2008, Hill, Hanton, Matthews, and Fleming studied sub-optimal performance in sports, also known as the phenomenon of \\"choking\\". They determined that when individuals were worried about negative evaluations by the audience, and performing tasks that they were not familiar with, they often would perform at a lower level than when they did without an audience. In 2011, Anderson- Hanley, Snyder, Nimon, and Arciero found that older adults riding \\"cybercycles\\", virtual-reality enhanced stationary bikes with interactive competitions, exercised at higher rates than adults riding stationary bikes. In 2012, Murayama and Elliot conducted a meta-analysis where they found that the effects on performance commonly attributed to competition are actually due to performance goals. Competition prompts either performance-approach goals, which are what facilitate performance improvements, or performance-avoidance goals, which undermine performance. = Animals = Social facilitation in animals is when the performance of a behaviour by an animal increases the probability of other animals also engaging in that behaviour or increasing the intensity of the behaviour. In 1969, Zajonc, Heingartner, and Herman demonstrated that social facilitation occurs not only in humans, but also in species with limited or no cognitive processing. They observed that it takes a cockroach a longer time to complete a complex maze in the presence of other cockroaches than when alone. They also observed that in a simple, straight runway, a cockroach reaches the end of the runway faster in the presence of other cockroaches than when alone. This experiment lends support to the theory that physiological arousal resulting from the presence of others leads to similar social facilitation effects in animals as well. In 2009, Dindo, Whiten, and de Waal studied the effect of social facilitation in capuchin monkeys. The monkeys in this study were required to complete a new foraging task, either alone or in a social group. While both sets of monkeys completed the task, those in the social group completed it three times faster than those monkeys that were alone. This increase in speed was attributed to \\"observational learning and synchronization of behavior between group mates.\\"  Electronic performance monitoring Researchers have used electronic performance monitoring (EPM) to examine the effects of social facilitation. This trend had previously been limited to face-to-face or group settings, but electronic performance monitoring establishes the impact of social facilitation in a virtual sense. EPM is the utilization of information technologies (e.g. computer networks) to track, evaluate, analyze, and report information regarding an employee's performance. Many businesses have adopted this method in which workers activity is automatically monitored throughout the workday. This topic is of substantial interest to those in the field of social psychology due to underlying mechanism at work; namely, the phenomenon of social facilitation. One study found that EPM did enhance productivity, but only in ways that are consistent with the effects of social facilitation. Employees working on a data entry task were monitored while working alone, with others, or as part of a cohesive group. Results indicated that EPM improved the performance of highly skilled workers, but interfered with the performance of those who were less skilled. Moreover, with the exception of those working in a cohesive group, monitoring was found to increase workers' feelings of stress and anxiety. On the other hand, participants responded more favorably to performance monitoring when they believed that they could turn off the monitoring and that only their job-related activities were being evaluated. Also, EPM was viewed more positively when workers were given the opportunity to participate in decisions regarding the use of the system. Results support that the effect of social facilitation is not just limited to the physical presence of others, but also extends to presence in a virtual sense as well. In 2009, Thompson, Sebastienelli and Murray conducted an experiment to determine the effect of electronic monitoring on students who used web-based training to learn new online search skills. They found that participants who were explicitly told that their training was being monitored performed markedly worse on a post-training skills test than participants who were unaware that their training was being monitored. These findings adhere to the basic premise of social facilitation and reveal that the heightened awareness of evaluation on complex tasks significantly hinders performance.  In educational settings  Groups are formed in a variety of educational settings around the world. Some examples include a group of physics students completing a laboratory exercise, a team of touch rugby players, a set of high school prefects, a group of students formed to brainstorm ideas for energy saving techniques, and study groups. Some groups enhance members' motivation and help students stay focused on their academic goals. However, a study group may inhibit the acquisition of new information, concepts, and skills, as the presence of others can be distracting. These distractions can interfere during the early phases of learning, both in overt and covert practicing. In a study in which participants had to learn a list of words, they were too embarrassed to rehearse the material out aloud and as a consequence of this group pressure, their performance suffered. Zajonc suggested that the student study alone, preferably in an isolated cubicle, and arrange to write examinations surrounded by many other students, on stage, and in the presence of a large audience. The results of the examination would be beyond the student's wildest expectations, assuming that the material had been thoroughly learned beforehand. Contributing factors Contributing factors to the audience effect could include what kind of crowd is present, such as a supportive crowd (e.g., the crowd at a team's home ground) or a hostile crowd (e.g., the crowd when a team is playing an away game). Also, the proximity of the crowd or the size of the crowd could influence the result of the audience effect. More factors such as nature of the task, coping skills with potential negative effects of audience, and even the playing venue (home or away) could be things to consider when examining the audience effect. Social facilitation is a widespread phenomenon in society. Many public tasks demonstrate the effects, both the costs and benefits, of social facilitation. From taking exams in a high school or college environment to performing in sporting events, people may perform better or fall short depending on the task's complexity. In many experiments, people display signs of social facilitation even in everyday tasks, such as driving. This effect can even be seen in animals, as displayed by Zajonc, Heingarter, and Herman's study on cockroaches. Business can also use social facilitation to their advantage, specifically in online auctions, which takes into the account the emergence of instant messaging and communication availability technologies. The interaction between buyers and sellers in traditional, face-to-face markets creates phenomena such as social facilitation, where the presence of others impacts behaviour and performance. In the study involving Java-based Internet Dutch auction, the findings indicated that social facilitation does indeed occur and participants improve their results and stay longer in the auction under conditions of higher virtual presence. Participants also indicate a preference for auction arrangements with higher degrees of virtual presence.  Controversies  Social facilitation's definition and explanations are not without controversy. Social psychologists first debate whether social facilitation in humans can be through mere presence, or whether it must be through evaluation. It was concluded that although the influence of the mere presence of others can be easily concealed by many other complex social factors, it is one of the variables that contributes to the power of others to influence an individual's performance. One of the greatest controversies surrounding social facilitation is its origination. Psychologists continue to debate whether social facilitation is adopted through the innate biology of humans and animals, or through social learning, either from interaction with society or from individual interaction with other people, and not society in general. Further research and expansion of experiments and theories may begin to resolve, or further complicate, these issues. In light of certain weaknesses and inadequacies of drive theory explanation, social facilitation is argued to be in need for a more cognitive approach. A more cognitive model constructed in an expectancy theory framework is shown as a plausible alternative explanation for employee performance and the effects of social facilitation. While there is not much evidence presented by this controversy it is recommended that direction of future research should test this model. Furthermore, there is difficulty in determining which social facilitation approach is the most accurate. The biggest conflict comes between the activation (or mere presence) and evaluation approaches, with the activation approach stating that the mere presence of an audience leads to social facilitation, and the evaluation approach stating that it is the fear of being judged by a capable audience that leads to social facilitation. Despite the two clearly conflicting schools of thought, researchers have not been able to conclusively prove which one is correct.

The University of Potsdam is a public university in Potsdam, capital of the state of Brandenburg, Germany. It is mainly situated across three campuses in the city. Some faculty buildings are part of the New Palace of Sanssouci which is known for its UNESCO World Heritage status. The University of Potsdam is Brandenburg's largest university and the fourth largest in the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolitan area. More than 8,000 people are working in scholarship and science. In 2009 the University of Potsdam became a winner in the \\"Excellence in Teaching\\" initiative of the Stifterverband f√ºr die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Business innovation agency for the German science system).  History  The University of Potsdam was formed in 1991 by the amalgamation of the Karl Liebknecht College of Education and the Brandenburg State College, as well as several other smaller institutions. As the university in large part emerged from the College of Education, emphasis today is still placed on teacher training. = Historical buildings = Babelsberg campus ‚Äì House 1 Some parts of the university are located in historical buildings that have been named as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. The university library and the Institute of History can be found in a part of the commons in the park of Sanssouci, at the New Palace, as can the Institute of Mathematics in the former stables. The other campuses, Babelsberg and Golm, are also of historical interest. The oldest buildings of the Golm campus were built in the 1930s to house the Luftwaffe's intelligence department. After World War II the College of Law of the East German Ministry for State Security moved in. The current Faculty of Law is located in Babelsberg/Griebnitzsee in the former presidial and administrative buildings of the German Red Cross (1939/40). Other lecture halls and buildings were built in the 1950s directly behind the Schloss Babelsberg for the Academy of Justice and the East German state.  Campuses  Being today the largest university in the state of Brandenburg, the University of Potsdam mainly stretches across three campuses on the city's outskirts: =New Palace= The New Palace campus of the University of Potsdam The student village on the Babelsberg Campus New Palace, Sanssouci (Am Neuen Palais): Faculties of Philosophy, Institutes of Mathematics and Sports. The university's main campus, which includes the Auditorium Maximum, is situated in the immediate proximity of Park Sanssouci. The Communs ‚Äì the prestigious annexes of the New Palace are home to some of the institutes of the Faculty of Arts. The eighteenth century baroque buildings, which disguise their former purpose as the Palace's offices and service rooms with staircases, porticos, cupolas, and rich ornamentation, are currently home to the university's presidential office and administration. The Institutes of Sports Science and Sports Medicine as well as the Institute for Mathematics can be found on the Campus Am Neuen Palais. =Golm= Golm: Faculties of Humanities, Mathematics and Science. Most institutes of the Faculty of Science as well as the Human Sciences Faculty are located in Potsdam-Golm, forming one of the largest science parks in the region. Three Max Planck Institutes and two Fraunhofer Institutes as well as the start-up center GO:IN have already settled here. =Babelsberg= Potsdam- Babelsberg/Griebnitzsee: Faculties of Law, Economics and Social Studies, Institutes of Computer Science, the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering. Campus Griebnitzsee is situated along the city border with Berlin, not far from the famous Babelsberg film studios, and houses the Law Faculty and the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences. The Institute of Computer Sciences is also located here and benefits greatly from its proximity to the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering, a completely privately funded co-institute of the University of Potsdam. Other small institutes and departments exist in the City of Potsdam. The Botanischer Garten Potsdam is the university's botanical garden.  Academic profile  At the beginning of the winter semester of the 2008/2009 academic year, roughly 20,000 young people were studying at the University of Potsdam. The largest number of students were enrolled at the Faculty of Philosophy, 5,934 (30%), with 5,324 (27%) at the Faculty of Mathematics and Science. 58% of the students are female, and more than 2,000 are external students. 26% of the freshers come from East Germany, 14% from the West and 14% from Berlin, evaluated by the place where they obtained their entry requirements. After a comprehensive evaluation of its research performance in 2007, the University of Potsdam nominated eight areas of distinction (\\"Profilbereiche\\") and one area of excellence in the field of Cognitive Sciences (\\"Exzellenzbereich\\") to award their international recognition and research productivity. With interdisciplinary research agenda, the area of excellence links the departments of Psychology, Linguistics, and Sports and Health Science. UP offers more than 100 degree programs in various fields, offered in German as well as other languages, notably French and English. = Faculties = AudiMax (auditorium maximum) of the Potsdam University As is common in Germany, the University of Potsdam's teaching and research programmes are carried out along the lines of faculties. The university contains the following faculties:  Faculty of Law  The Law Faculty's curriculum offers the basic and required courses necessary to become a fully qualified lawyer. This training includes civil law, criminal law, and public law. At Potsdam, the areas of concentration in research and teaching comprise the fundamentals of law, civil judicature, business law, international law, public administration as well as business, tax, and environmental criminal law. All these areas offer ample opportunity for specialized study. Additional events for training and continuing education for practitioners in the municipal realm are offered by the Institute for Local Government Studies and in international relations by the Human Rights Centre. Furthermore, a German-French law program exists in cooperation with University Paris Ouest-Nanterre/La D√©fense.  Faculty of Philosophy  In recent years, the University of Potsdam's Philosophical Faculty has redefined itself in the spirit of cross-disciplinary cultural studies. Research and teaching at the Institutes for Religious Studies, Jewish Studies, Jewish Theology, Philosophy, History, Classical Philology, German Studies, English and American Studies, Romance Studies, Slavic Studies as well as Art and Media are devoted to a broad understanding of culture that is defined by including all aspects of human life. Drawing from the broad range of faculty specialties, the thematic concentrations of \\"Cultures in/of Mobility,\\" \\"Forms of Life and the Know How of Living\\" as well as \\"Region and Identity in Europe\\" were created. This emphasis in regard to content encourages interdisciplinary cooperation, but it also incorporates perspectives that are outside the Philosophical Faculty's traditional subject canon. The Focus Area Unsettled Cultures, for example, investigates among others the history and cultural practice of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and thereby combines different areas of study, such as theology, literature, ethics, medicine, and cosmology. In the spirit of research-based teaching, new academic programs such as Mobility Studies are being developed to complement the already existing interdisciplinary Master's programs in Jewish Studies, Communications Linguistics, Military Studies, European Media Studies as well as others. Furthermore, the faculty highly values the intensive support of young scholars. The graduate colleges, graduate schools, and externally funded projects under the auspices of the Philosophical Faculty offer young scholars the opportunity for interdisciplinary and international cooperation.  Faculty of Human Science  With the Cognitive Sciences and the Educational Sciences, the Faculty of Human Sciences includes two of the interdisciplinary focus areas of the University of Potsdam that operate beyond faculty boundaries. The Cognitive Sciences' excellence is based predominantly on the Collaborative Research Centre \\"Information Structure: The Linguistic Means for Structuring Utterances, Sentences and Texts.\\" Empirical research is currently being expanded in the educational sciences, and it is closely linked to teaching. In the education and training of aspiring teachers in all faculties, the Faculty of Human Sciences occupies a central role. The \\"Area of Excellence Cognitive Sciences\\" and the \\"Focus Area Educational Sciences\\" are divided into further research clusters and teaching units. Instruction in the departments of psychology, linguistics, sports, and health science is organized into educational science and teacher training. The research emphases are language, action and behavior, health, professional and popular sports, school and classroom as well as teaching across the life span. In the future, the existing potentials in the area of health sciences and prevention will be developed into another focus area. The research area in health is currently already well connected with the support systems for professional sports. The Faculty of Human Sciences mediates between theory and real life in a variety of ways. It is a service provider for the city of Potsdam and the federal state of Brandenburg. It maintains several consultation centers for psychotherapy and speech therapy as well as a university clinic. The university clinic is currently licensed as an examination center of the German Olympic Sports Confederation. Ultimately, a regional health network will be developed in cooperation with other service providers. Furthermore, the faculty is actively striving for more quality in training students by establishing national and international Master's and graduate programs and by developing a system of quality assurance in teaching.  Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences  With business administration and economics, political and administrative sciences, and sociology as fields of study, the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences has continuously renewed itself and created its own unique and independent brand label. Research and teaching are closely intertwined. The faculty is considered one of the most important German institutes for research, training, and consulting in the areas of policy research and administrative sciences. Another concentration in the field of innovation and technology is currently being developed. Following a multi-theoretical approach, researchers are investigating the interactive relationship between politics, economy, and institutions at different levels and in different fields of activity. The interdisciplinary approach allows for a study of the interplay between the economy, public and private institutions, and policy-making. Problems of governance between state, economy, and civil society are just as much a concern as problems of governance within the very differentiated public sector. Political and administrative scientists, sociologists, and economists are working on collaborative projects. The interplay of different research approaches and methods creates empirical and theoretical knowledge that transmits a complex and differentiated picture of socioeconomic, cultural, and political developmental processes in modern societies‚Äîdomestically as well as internationally. The Faculty is very engaged in linking research and teaching to practice. Therefore, the outcomes of research in the areas start-up, consulting, and innovation directly benefit the faculty's Institute for Start-up and Innovation (BIEM CEIP), a central service institution for aspiring entrepreneurs. The Institute for Local Government Studies (KWI) conducts collaborative research with the Law Faculty in examining issues faced by municipalities in the new L√§nder and offers continuing education to its elected officials. Furthermore, the faculty's Potsdam Center for Public Policy and Management (PCPM) ensures active national and international knowledge transfer with its research and consulting projects as well as opportunities for academically-focused continuing education. The German Center for Higher Education Development considers the Master‚Äôs and Ph.D. programs offered through the PCPM to be among the very best in Europe. Among these are the EAPAA-accredited international postgraduate Program in Public Policy and Management for public sector professionals in English language with the (MPM) Master of Public Management and its three streams: Public Policy and Administration (PPA), Global Public Policy (GPP) and GeoGovernance (GG), the German-French Master of European Governance and Administration (MEGA) and the Executive Master of Public Management (EMPM) Program with the Hertie School of Governance.  Faculty of Mathematics and Science  Under its roof, the Faculty of Science at the University of Potsdam contains the Institutes for Biochemistry and Biology, Chemistry, Nutrition Sciences, Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Computer Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy as well as the University of Potsdam Botanical Garden. Especially the study programs in Geoecology, Geoscience, Nutrition Science, Polymer Science, and Software Systems Engineering are in high demand. The faculty has been strong in gaining external funding and has established future-oriented concentrations and productive core areas in research and teaching. Five of the university's eight focus areas are part of the Faculty of Science: Earth Sciences, Functional Soft Matter, Functional Ecology and Evolution, Complex Systems, and Plant Genomics/Systems Biology. The faculty's own concentrations, such as teacher training in mathematics and natural sciences, sensibly complement the focus areas by supporting their interconnectedness and contribute to their continuous advancement and renewal. The close cooperation between the natural sciences and extramural research institutions in the Berlin-Brandenburg region, already intended in the University of Potsdam's founding concept, was praised very early on by the German Council of Science and Humanities. The collaboration with several institutes of the Max Planck Society, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, the Helmholtz Association, the Leibniz Association, and the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering exemplify this extensive networking. Currently, there are more than 40 joint professorships with these institutions. = Notable research centres and institutes = Within faculties, teaching and research activities may be further decentralised through departments, graduate schools or institutes. For example, * PCPM, Potsdam Center for Policy and Management, which has earned the University of Potsdam a reputation as one of the leading competence centers for Governance and the Public Sector. A recent reputation study by the German Association for Political Science has declared the University of Potsdam one of the three most important German universities and research institutions in the area of policy research and administrative sciences. The Center for Higher Education Development considers the Master‚Äôs and Ph.D. programs offered here to be among the very best in Europe. Among these are the EAPAA-accredited international postgraduate Program in Public Policy and Management for public sector professionals in English language with the (MPM) Master of Public Management and its three streams: Public Policy and Administration (PPA), Global Public Policy (GPP) and GeoGovernance (GG), the German-French Master of European Governance and AdministrationEuropean Governance and Administration (MEGA) and the Executive Master of Public Management (EMPM) Program with the Hertie School of Governance. * BIEM-CEIP, Institute for Start-ups, Entrepreneurship and Innovation * KWI, Institute for Local Government Studies The Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering * The Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering is the first, and currently the only university institute that is completely privately financed. Hasso Plattner, co-founder and advisory board chairman of the software company SAP, created the opportunity for a unique academic elite-education in IT systems technology. Meeting the demands of the industry, about a dozen professors and more than fifty additional visiting professors and lecturers are currently training about 450 highly talented young people in the Bachelor and Master's programs to become IT systems engineers. * The Hasso Plattner Institute of Design integrates product design, engineering, and business management education, in cooperation with Stanford University. While it is located in Stanford University, it is a joint project and a degree with respective content is also offered through the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam. * The Abraham Geiger College is the first rabbinical seminary in Central Europe after 1945. When the Nazis closed the Higher Institute for Jewish Studies (Hochschule f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judentums) in Berlin in 1942, it meant the end of an era that had begun with Abraham Geiger. In 1836 Geiger had called for the founding of a Jewish theological department at a German university that would be dedicated to Jewish tradition in the spirit of academic freedom. Today, the Abraham Geiger College provides education for rabbis and cantors for Jewish communities in Central and Eastern Europe. Besides vocational training, participants go through a regular university program of study that is integrated into the extensive curriculum of the School of Jewish Theology at the University of Potsdam and that must be completed with a B.A. for cantors and an M.A. for rabbis. After completing the degree and contingent upon agreement of supervisors and mentors, the rabbinical college then recommends candidates for ordination into the Jewish clergy. * The Moses Mendelssohn Center for European-Jewish Studies focuses on the history, religion, and culture of Jews and Judaism in European countries. A special accent is placed on the history of relations between Jews and their non-Jewish environment. On the one hand, research is concerned with the problems of social integration and acculturation faced by Jews, and on the other hand it focuses on comparative social historical questions related to living conditions and to geographical as well as social mobility. Further areas of research include hostility towards Jews as well as historical and contemporary antisemitism. Much attention is also given to sociocultural and intellectual-historical aspects, such as literature, art, religion, philosophy, and music. The Moses Mendelssohn Center owns an extensive and publicly accessible specialized library that currently holds around 50,000 volumes. * The Potsdam Graduate School, which sees its primary task in the promotion of already accredited doctoral candidates and post-doctorals as well as in the continuous optimization of doctoral conditions and quality management. The Potsdam Graduate School stands for transparency within doctoral procedures and the intensification and improvement of doctoral supervision. = Supportive institutions = * The Language Centre offers students of all faculties the chance to learn many languages at various levels of proficiency, and holds a collegial certificate of international accreditation from UNIcert. * The Career Service supports students and graduates during the transition phase from study into practice. * Sports center * Computing center * AStA ‚Äì Students' union executive committee * International Relations Office * Studentenwerk Potsdam * University Library = Tuition fees and scholarships = Tuition fees at University of Potsdam vary, depending on nationality and programme of study. For German and EU/EEA students there is currently no tuition fee, however, several additional fees such as for the students union as well as mandatory public transportation tickets for students have to be paid. For non-EU/EEA students tuition fees may apply. For both EU/EEA students as well as non-EU/EEA students a variety of financial assistance and scholarships is available. The University of Potsdam does not provide scholarships directly. Among others, the German Academic Exchange Service (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst ‚Äì DAAD) offers a very extensive scholarship programme. Students or post-graduates can apply for a wide variety of scholarships, but the conditions and opportunities vary according to the country of origin and field of study. Other scholarship providers also have varying prerequisites regarding country of origin, field of study, prior academic performance, the duration of the scholarship, etc. The prerequisites and the weighting of the various criteria for stipends are determined by the individual profiles of the foundation providing for the scholarships. For example, one‚Äôs previous marks or grades are weighted differently by the various foundations. For some foundations, previous marks are weighted as the main criteria, and the social situation of the applicant is given significantly less weight. For other scholarships, good marks are important in order to receive a scholarship, but this does not mean that an applicant qualifies for one. Many foundations give significant weight to financial need, engagement in the civil society, or a developed personal profile. Willingness to participate in the respective foundation's programme is also important to some foundations. Information is available at University of Potsdam for students wishing to apply. = Rankings = The University of Potsdam was ranked #24 in the World in the Times Higher Education Young University Rankings 2019. It was also ranked #41 in the world in Nature's Top 175 Young Universities Ranking. The university has a particularly strong linguistics programme, ranked #51-100 in the QS World University Rankings for Linguistics. The Digital Engineering faculty, which is led by the Hasso Plattner Institute, runs Germany's top-ranked computer science-related study programme according to the CHE 2019/2020 ranking, which is Germany's largest academic ranking.  International partnerships  A cooperation among the universities in Berlin (Humboldt University of Berlin, Technical University of Berlin, Free University of Berlin) and University of Potsdam exists, which allows students of these universities to take courses at the respective partner universities, in accordance with their curriculum. The University of Potsdam is well connected: it has found scientific partners of international standing with the Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research and the German Institute for Human Nutrition ‚Äì both institutes of the Leibniz Association ‚Äì as well as the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam ‚Äì German Research Centre for Geosciences. Close cooperation and joint professorships also exist with the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, and many other research institutions. Last but not least, the university collaborates with both institutes of the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft in the Science Park Potsdam-Golm, a research campus that is growing in significance far beyond Germany's borders. Similarly, the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam in cooperation with Stanford University offers a design school based in Stanford University, the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design. While it is located at Stanford University, various partnerships as well as a degree is offered through University of Potsdam. The university offers a number of German courses, organizes intercultural training workshops, and matches up tandem-partners who want to learn one another's language. Selected study programs, in particular several Master programs, may also be completed in English. International partnerships offer opportunities to spend one semester or a full year at one of many partner universities. Jewish studies in Israel, sports management in Australia, language and politics in Moscow, or an excursion to Montana to visit the geographical center of the earth ‚Äì the choice among about 300 partnerships is great. From a regular course of study or an internship to a double degree or Ph.D. studies ‚Äì everything is possible. Potsdam is a popular choices both for the Erasmus and Tempus as well as for the Fulbright program and the international programs of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). * Several exchange programs and partnerships exist. An institution at Potsdam's Law Faculty that is unique in Germany is the German-French law program, which is operated in cooperation with the partner University Paris Ouest-Nanterre/La D√©fense. At the University of Potsdam students can participate not just in an exchange program, but they also have the opportunity in their first two years in the standard German law program to complete an additional, self-contained program of study in French law. This French part of the program is taught by French visiting scholars from the partner university and is conducted in French. = English programs = The following are English-language programs of study. These are programmes of study in which all courses and coursework is carried out in English: * Anglophone Modernities in Literature and Culture (M.A.) * Astrophysics (M.Sc.) * Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (M.Sc.) * Bioinformatics (M.Sc.) * Cognitive Science - Embodied Cognition (M.Sc./Ph.D.) * Cognitive Systems: Language, Learning and Reasoning (M.Sc.) * Data Science (M.Sc.) * Digital Health (M.Sc.) * European Master in Clinical Linguistics (EMCL) (M.Sc.) * International Master/Ph.D. Program for Experimental and Clinical Linguistics (IECL) (M.Sc./Ph.D.) * International Master/Ph.D. Program Clinical Exercise Science (CES) (M.Sc./Ph.D.) * International War Studies (M.A.) * Jewish Theology (M.A.) * Master of Public Management (MPM) * National and International Administration (MANIA) (M.A./Ph.D.) * Polymer Science (M.Sc.) * Remote Sensing, geoInformation and Visualization (M.Sc.) * Toxicology (M.Sc.) = Executive Master Programs = Several executive masters are offered and have reached a high popularity, offered entirely or partly in English. * Intercultural Business Communication (M.A.) * Master of Business Administration (MBA) - Biotechnology und Medical Technology Innovative Health Care Management Information Technology Innovative Technologies Negotiation Management * Master of Public Management (MPM) * Master of European Governance and Administration (MEGA) * Media Law and Management - Digital Media Law and Management Master (LL.M./MBA) * Law (Magister Legum - Graduate studies for foreign graduates) * School and Education Management (M.A.) * Tax Law (LL.M.) * Corporate and Tax Law (LL.M.) = International doctoral studies = University of Potsdam offers international students the completion of a doctoral thesis. Doctoral students in Germany generally pursue their doctorates in the context of individual research projects, rather than in structured programmes as in many other countries. Upon completion of a dissertation project, one receives a doctoral degree for individual scholarly achievements. The prerequisite for doctoral studies is an above average graduate degree, Master's of Arts, Master's of Science, Diploma, Staatsexamen or another equivalent degree. The doctoral examination board (Promotionsausschuss) of your institute of interest, or the Dean of the Law Faculty respectively, is responsible for determining questions of equivalency. Writing a dissertation should take no longer than three years. After submitting a dissertation and receiving a positive assessment, doctoral students are required to take part in a disputation.

This refers to the process of transforming the nafs (carnal self or desires) from its deplorable state of self-centrality through various spiritual stages towards the level of purity and submission to the Will of Allah.Tazkiah: Purification of the Soul Its basis is in learning the shari'ah and deeds from the known authentic sunnah and applying it in your own deeds through life resulting in spiritual awareness of Allah (being constantly aware that He is with us by His knowledge and knows all that we do, along with being in constant remembrance or dhikr of Him in your thoughts and actions) being the highest level of Ihsan. The person who purifies himself/herself is called a Zaki (). Tazkiah, along with the related concepts of tarbiyah ‚Äì self-development and talim ‚Äì training and education, does not limit itself to the conscious learning process: it is rather the task of giving form to the act of righteous living itself: treating every moment of life with remembering one's position in front of Allah . Etymology Tazkiah originally meant pruning the plant ‚Äì to remove what is harmful for its growth. When the term is applied to the human personality, it means to beautify it and to remove from it all evil traces and spiritual diseases that are obstacles in experiencing Allah .Maulana Fazlur Rahman Ansari, Knowledge and the Self In Islam, the ultimate objective of religion and shariah (Islamic law) and the real purpose of raising prophets from among mankind was performing and teaching tazkiah.Amin Ahsan Islahi, Tadabbur-r- Qur'an: Tafsir of Surah Al-Fatiha and Surah Al-Baqara Literally the term encompasses two meanings: one is to cleanse and purify from adulterants, while the other is to improve and develop towards the height of perfection. Technically it conveys the sense of checking oneself from erroneous tendencies and beliefs and turning them to the path of virtue and piety (fear of God's displeasure) and developing it to attain the stage of perfection. The word zakat (alms tax) comes from the same Arabic verbal root, since zakat purifies an individual's wealth by recognition of Allah's right over a portion of it.Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali, Purification of the Soul, p. 2 It finds its origin in the Quranic command to: \\"Take sadaqah (charity) from their property in order to purify and sanctify them\\" (At-Taubah: 103). cf. Other similarly used words to the term are Islah-i qalb (reform of the heart), Ihsan (beautification), taharat (purification), Ikhlas (purity), qalb-is-salim (pure/safe/undamaged heart) and lastly, tasawuf (sufism), which is basically an ideology rather than a term, mostly misinterpreted as the idea of sanctification in Islam. In scripture =In Quran= The word Tazkiah has been used in many places of the Qur'an. It has been used 18 times in 15 verses of 11 Surahs; in Ayat 129, 151, 174 of Surah Al-Baqarah, in 77 and 164 verse of sura Al-Imran, the verse of Nisa 49, Surah Taubah, verse 103, Sura taha's 76 ayat, in 2nd verse of Sura Al-Jumm'ah, 3 and 7 ayat of Sura Abasa, in verse 21 of Surah al-A'la, verse 9 of Surah Shams and in the verse 18 of Surah al-Layl. =In Hadith= The word tazkiah is also found in a few hadith, with also of a meaning as purify and santify. Importance The soul is created devoid of traits except for spirituality love of Allah. As one progresses through life he develops malakat related to his lifestyle. The soul becomes accustomed to repeated behavior, which then determines actions. Noble faculties manifest moral and wise behavior, while evil faculties manifest immorality. These faculties determine the fate in the akhira. Moral virtues bring eternal happiness and well-being (fala·∏•), while moral corruption leads to everlasting wretchedness. Man must purge blameworthy traits (akhlƒÅq madhm≈´ma) before he can integrate ethical and moral virtues. According to the ulema, obtainment of fala·∏• in this life and the next is directly connected to tazkiah. This is based on the Quranic verses: 91:7 ŸàŸéŸÜŸéŸÅŸíÿ≥Ÿç ŸàŸéŸÖŸéÿß ÿ≥ŸéŸàŸéŸëÿßŸáŸéÿß : Wanafsin wamƒÅ sawwƒÅhƒÅ : Consider the human self, and how it is formed in accordance with what it is meant to be 91:8 ŸÅŸéÿ£ŸéŸÑŸíŸáŸéŸÖŸéŸáŸéÿß ŸÅŸèÿ¨ŸèŸàÿ±ŸéŸáŸéÿß ŸàŸéÿ™ŸéŸÇŸíŸàŸéÿßŸáŸéÿß : FaalhamahƒÅ fuj≈´rahƒÅ wataqwƒÅhƒÅ : And how it is imbued with moral failings as well as with consciousness of God! 91:9 ŸÇŸéÿØŸí ÿ£ŸéŸÅŸíŸÑŸéÿ≠Ÿé ŸÖŸéŸÜ ÿ≤ŸéŸÉŸéŸëÿßŸáŸéÿß : Qad afla·∏•a man zakkƒÅhƒÅ : To a happy state shall indeed attain he who causes this [self] to grow in purity 91:10 ŸàŸéŸÇŸéÿØŸí ÿÆŸéÿßÿ®Ÿé ŸÖŸéŸÜ ÿØŸéÿ≥ŸéŸëÿßŸáŸéÿß : Waqad khƒÅba man dassƒÅhƒÅ : And truly lost is he who buries it [in darkness]. This illustrates that Allah created the human soul with both evil and good inclinations, and endowed man with the ability to distinguish between the two: eternal fala·∏• is achieved by choosing good in the struggle instead of evil and striving to make it prevail. Similarly, Allah says in sura as-shu'ara : > \\"On that Day, neither wealth nor children will be of any benefit, only he > [will be happy] who comes before Allah with a sound heart free of evil.\\" Thus, the only people who will be saved from punishment on the Day of Judgment are those possessing qulub salƒ´ma (sound hearts: ÿ®ŸêŸÇŸéŸÑŸíÿ®Ÿç ÿ≥ŸéŸÑŸêŸäŸÖŸç). The phrase \\"salƒ´m\\" (sound) is related to the word \\"aslama\\" because \\"Islam\\" is moving towards that state of soundness. Anas Karzoon offered the following definition of tazkiah al-nafs, \\"It is the purification of the soul from inclination towards evils and sins, and the development of its fitrah towards goodness, which leads to its uprightness and its reaching ihsaan.\\"Karzoon (Vol.1 p.12) Attempts to obey God's commands are successful only when one is purified; then the soul can receive God's unlimited grace. The hadith of the Prophet Muhammad: (\\"my religion is based on cleanliness\\"), does not refer to outward cleanliness alone; it also alludes to the soul's inner purity. Al-Khatib al- Baghdadi narrates in his \\"Tarikh\\" on the authority of Jabir that the Prophet returned from one of his campaigns and told his companions: \\"You have come forth in the best way of coming forth: you have come from the smaller jihad to the greater jihad.\\" They said: \\"And what is the greater jihad?\\" He replied: \\"The striving (mujahadat) of Allah's servants against their idle desires.\\"A. Schimmel, The Mystical Dimensions of Islam, p. 112 When some Sufi masters were asked about the meaning of Islam, they answered: \\"[It is] slaughtering the soul by the swords of opposition [to it].\\" The famous Sufi master Mawlana Jalal al-Din al-Rumi has argued that the constant struggle against nafs is jihad al-akbar (the greatest war). To attain perfection, it is necessary to struggle against lusts and immoral tendencies, and prepare the soul to receive God's grace. If man travels the path of purification, God will aid and guide him. As the Qur'an maintains in sura al-Ankabut: 29:69 ŸàŸéÿßŸÑŸéŸëÿ∞ŸêŸäŸÜŸé ÿ¨ŸéÿßŸáŸéÿØŸèŸàÿß ŸÅŸêŸäŸÜŸéÿß ŸÑŸéŸÜŸéŸáŸíÿØŸêŸäŸéŸÜŸéŸëŸáŸèŸÖŸí ÿ≥Ÿèÿ®ŸèŸÑŸéŸÜŸéÿß ŸàŸéÿ•ŸêŸÜŸéŸë ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸé ŸÑŸéŸÖŸéÿπŸé ÿßŸÑŸíŸÖŸèÿ≠Ÿíÿ≥ŸêŸÜŸêŸäŸÜŸé : Waallathƒìna jahad≈´ fƒìna lanahdiyannahum subulanƒÅ wainna Allaha lama'a almu·∏•sinƒìna : But as for those who struggle hard in Our cause, We shall certainly guide them onto paths leading unto Us: for, behold, God is indeed with the doers of good. Process The initial awakening to purification refers to recognition that the spiritual search is more important and meaningful than our previously valued worldly goods and ambitions. The process of tazkiyya an-nafs starts with \\"Verily deeds are according to intentions\\" and ends with the station of perfect character, Ihsan, \\"Worship Him as though you see Him\\", the reference being to the first hadith in Sahih Bukhari and the oft referred hadith famously known as the hadith of Gibril in Sahih Muslim.Al- Bukhari, Kitab al-Qadar, 11/499 Ihsan is the highest level of iman that the seeker can develop through his quest for reality. This is referred to as al- yaqin al-haqiqi; the reality of certainty and knowing that it brings true understanding and leads to al-iman ash-shuhudi, the true faith of witnessing the signs of Allah's Oneness everywhere. The only higher level of realization is maqam al-ihsan. At this station of perfection, the seeker realizes that Allah is observing him every moment.Akbar Husain, Horizons of Spiritual Psychology Saudi cleric Khalid Bin Abdullah al-Musleh listed seven obstacles in the way of Tazkiah in his book \\"Islahul Qulub\\" (reforming the hearts): # Shirk # Rejecting Sunnah and following Bid'ah # Obeying the instinct and ego (nafs) # Doubt # Negligence (ghaflah) Ha also listed 8 ways to maintain Tazkiah: # Reading Quran # Loving Allah # Doing dhikr # Tawbah and Istighfar # Supplicate (dua) for hidayah and purify # Remembering afterlife (Akhirah) # Reading the biographies of the salafs # Company of good, honest and pious people. =Maintaining the Nafs= It must be remembered that tazkiah is not a hal (temporary state), which is something that descends from Allah into a seeker's heart, without him being able to repel it when it comes, or to attract it when it goes, by his own effort. The maqƒÅm and hal are deeply related and often it is very difficult to distinguish between them. To ascertain their relationship Professor A.J. Arberry, in his Sufism has shown the distinction as follows: \\"the maqƒÅm is a stage of spiritual attainment on the pilgrim's progress to God, which is the result of the mystic's personal efforts and endeavor, whereas the hal is a spiritual mood depending not upon the mystic but upon God.\\" The Muslim philosopher Abd al-Karƒ´m ibn HawƒÅzin al- Qushayri (b. 986 Nishapur, Iran d. 1074) summarized the difference between the two concepts in his Ar-RisƒÅla-fi-'ilm-at-ta≈üawwuf, where he maintained that, \\"states are gifts, the stations are earnings.\\"George F. McLean, Deliverance from error and mystical union with the Almighty Tazkiah is a continuous process of purification to maintain spiritual health.Abdur-Rashid Siddiqui, Tazkiah: Self Purification and Development Similar to the process of maintaining physical health, any lapse in the regimen can cause one to lose their previous gains, and thus caution must always be used to not deviate from the path. Regarding this, it has been related that Imam Muhammad al-Busayri asked Shaykh Abul-Hasan 'Ali ibn Ja'far al-Kharqani (d. 1033) about the major seventeen negative psychological traits or mawƒÅni‚Äô (impediments) which the sƒÅlik must avoid in his struggle towards purification. If the sƒÅlik does not rigorously abstain from these aspects, his efforts will be wasted. Known as al-Akhlaqu 'dh-Dhamimah (the ruinous traits), they are also referred to as the Tree of Bad Manners:Muhammad Hisham Kabbani (2006), Sufi Science of Self- Realization: Guide to the Seventeen Ruinous Traits, Ten Steps to Discipleship, and Six Realities of the Heart, Fons Vitae of Kentucky Stages of nafs (inner-self) There are three principal stations of nafs or human consciousness that are specifically mentioned in the Qur'an. They are stages in the process of development, refinement and mastery of the nafs.I. Shah, The Sufis, Octagon Press 2001 #nafs-al-ammƒÅrah: unruly animal self or soul that dictates evil. #nafs-al-lawwƒÅmah: struggling moral self or self-reproaching soul. #nafs al-mutma'inna: satisfied soul or the composed God realized self.Muhammad Kabbani, Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition: Daily Practices and Devotions =The animal nafs (nafs-al-ammƒÅrah)= The Sufi's journey begins with the challenge of freeing oneself from the influence of shaytan and the nafs-al-ammara. Al-Kashani defines it as follows: the commanding soul is that which leans towards the bodily nature (al-tabƒ´'a al-badaniyya) and commands one to sensual pleasures and lusts and pulls the heart (qalb) in a downward direction. It is the resting place of evil and the source of blameworthy morals and bad actions.IstilƒÅhƒÅt al-sufiyya, pp. 77‚Äì8 In its primitive stage the nafs incites us to commit evil: this is the nafs as the lower self or the base instincts.A. Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam In the eponymous sura of the Qur'an, the prophet Yusef says \\"Yet I claim not that my nafs was innocent: Verily the nafs of man incites to evil.\\" Here he is explaining the circumstances in which he came to be falsely imprisoned for the supposed seduction of ZuleikƒÅ, the wife of Pharaoh's minister. .... =The reproachful nafs (nafs-al-lawwama)= If the soul undertakes this struggle it then becomes nafs-al-lawwama (reproachful soul): This is the stage where \\"the conscience is awakened and the self accuses one for listening to one's selfish mind. The original reference to this state is in sura Qiyama: 75:2 ŸàŸéŸÑŸéÿß ÿ£ŸèŸÇŸíÿ≥ŸêŸÖŸè ÿ®ŸêÿßŸÑŸÜŸéŸëŸÅŸíÿ≥Ÿê ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸàŸéŸëÿßŸÖŸéÿ©Ÿê : WalƒÅ oqsimu bialnnafsi al-lawwƒÅmati : I call to witness the regretful self (the accusing voice of man's own conscience) The sense of the Arabic word lawwama is that of resisting wrongdoing and asking God's forgiveness after we become conscious of wrongdoing. At this stage, we begin to understand the negative effects of our habitual self-centered approach to the world, even though we do not yet have the ability to change. Our misdeeds now begin to become repellent to us. We enter a cycle of erring, regretting our mistakes, and then erring again.Robert Frager, Sufi Psychology of Growth, Balance and Harmony Tree of good manners #Akhlaq-i-Hamidah - good character #As-Sidq - truthfulness Tree of bad manners #al-ghadab ‚Äì anger: considered the worst of all the negative traits. It may easily be said that anger is the source from which the others flow. The Prophet states in a hadith: \\"Anger (ghadab) blemishes one's belief.\\" Controlling anger is called kƒÅzm. #al-hiqd ‚Äì malice or having ill-will toward others; grows from lusting for what someone else has. You must replace hiqd with kindness and look upon your brother with love. There is a tradition that says \\"give gifts to one another, for gifts take away malice.\\" #al hasad ‚Äì jealousy or envy; a person inflicted with this disease wants others to lose blessings bestowed on them by Allah . #al-'ujb ‚Äì vanity or having pride because of an action, possession, quality or relationship. #al-bukhl ‚Äì stinginess: The cause of bukhl is love of the world, if you did not love it, then giving it up would be easy. To cure the disease of miserliness, one must force oneself to be generous, even if such generosity is artificial; this must be continued until generosity becomes second nature. #al-tama ‚Äì Greed - excessive desire for more than one needs or deserves. Having no limit to what one hoards of possessions! Seeking to fulfill worldly pleasures through forbidden means is called tama‚Äô. The opposite of tama‚Äô is called tafwiz, which means striving to obtain permissible and beneficial things and expecting that Allah will let you have them. #al-jubn ‚Äì cowardice: the necessary amount of anger (ghadab) or treating harshly is called bravery (shajƒÅ'at). Anger which is less than the necessary amount is called cowardice (junb). Imam Shafi says, \\"a person who acts cowardly in a situation which demands bravery resembles an ass.\\" A coward would not be able to show ghayrat for his wife or relatives when the situation requires it. He would not be able to protect them and thus will suffer oppression (zulm) and depreciation (ziliat). #al-batalah ‚Äì indolence or Sloth (deadly sin): batalah is inactivity resulting from a dislike of work. #al-riya‚Äô ‚Äì ostentation or showing off: riya‚Äô means to present something in a manner opposite to its true nature. In short, it means pretension, i.e., a person's performing deeds for the next world to impress the idea on others that he is really a pious person with earnest desire of the akhirah while in fact he wants to attain worldly desires. #al-hirsh ‚Äì attachment and love for the material world, such as desiring wealth and a long life. #al-'azamah ‚Äì superiority or claiming greatness: the cure is to humble oneself before Allah . #al-ghabawah wa 'l-kasalah ‚Äì heedlessness and laziness; \\"the heart needs nourishment, and heedlessness starves the spiritual heart.\\"Shaykh Muhammad Maulud, Alchemy of the Heart, Translated by Hamza Yusuf #al-hamm ‚Äì anxiety: this develops from heedlessness. The seeker must first understand that Allah is al-Razzaq (the Provider), and submit and be content with the will of Allah . #al-ghamm ‚Äì depression: passion (hawƒÅ) conduces to anguish (ghamm) whenever reason is allowed to represent itself as grievous or painful the loss of the suitable or desirable and is, therefore, a \\"rational affection\\" that can cause the soul untold suffering and perturbation. #al-manhiyat ‚Äì Eight Hundred Forbidden Acts #ghaflah ‚Äì neglect and forgetfulness of God, indifference: those guilty of ghaflah, the ghƒÅfil√ºn, are those who \\"know only a surface appearance of the life of this world, and are heedless of the hereafter\\" (30:7). #kibr ‚Äì arrogance or regarding one's self to be superior to others. The Prophet states in a hadith: \\"A person who has an atom's weight of conceit in his heart will not enter Paradise.\\" The opposite of arrogance is tawƒÅdu‚Äô, which is a feeling of equality. #hubb ul-dunya ‚Äì love of the material world: Materialism. The Prophet has said that \\"love of the world is the root of all evil.\\" If this ailment is treated and cured, all other maladies flowing from it will also disappear. The sƒÅlik must purify himself from these bad traits and rid his heart of the underlying ailments that are at their source. Outward adherence to the five pillars of Islam is not sufficient: he must be perfect in behavior. This requires a program of self-evaluation, purification, seclusion and establishing a practice of remembrance and contemplation under the guidance of an authorized Shaykh of Spiritual Discipline (shaykh at- tarbiyyah). In this way the seeker is able to achieve a state in which his heart is ready to receive Divine Inspiration and observe Divine Realities. =The nafs at peace (nafs-i-mutma'inna)= The Qur'an explains how one can achieve the state of the satisfied soul in sura Ar-Ra'd: \\"Those who believe, and whose hearts find their rest in the remembrance of God ‚Äì for, verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction (tatmainnu alquloobu).\\" Once the seeker can successfully transcend the reproachful soul, the process of transformation concludes with nafs-al-mutma'inna (soul at peace). However, for some Sufis orders the final stage is nafs-as-safiya wa kamila (soul restful and perfected in Allah's presence). The term is conceptually synonymous with Tasawwuf, Islah al-Batini etc.Ibn Rajab al- Hanbali, p. 73 Another closely related but not identical concept is tazkiah- al-qalb, or cleansing of the heart, which is also a necessary spiritual discipline for travelers on the Sufi path. The aim is the erasure of everything that stands in the way of purifying Allah's love (Ishq).For an explanation of these terms in the context of a discussion of Sufi psychology, see the article 'Sufi Science of the Soul', by M. Ajmal, in Islamic Spirituality, S.H. Nasr ed, vol. 1, Foundations. London: Routledge and Kegan and Paul, 1987, pp;. 294‚Äì307 The aim of tazkiah and moral development is to attain falah or happiness, thus realizing the nafs al-mutma'inna. This is the ideal stage of mind for Sufis. On this level one is firm in one's faith and leaves bad manners behind. The soul becomes tranquil, at peace. At this stage Sufis have relieved themselves of all materialism and worldly problems and are satisfied with the will of God. Man's most consummate felicity is reflecting Divine attributes. Tranquillization of the soul means an individual's knowledge is founded on such firm belief that no vicissitudes of distress, comfort, pain or pleasure can alter his trust in Allah and his expecting only good from Him. Instead, he remains pleased with Allah and satisfied with His decrees. Similarly, the foundations of deeds are laid in such firm character that no temptations, in adversity, prosperity, fear or hope, removes him from the shar'iah, so he fulfills the demands made by Allah and thus becomes His desirable servant.Amin Ahsan Islahi, Tazkiah: The Tranquilised Soul According to Qatada ibn al-Nu'man, the nafs al-mutma'inna is, \\"the soul of the believer, made calm by what Allah has promised. Its owner is at complete rest and content with his knowledge of Allah's Names and Attributes...\\"The Purification of the Soul p.71 In sura Fajr of the Quran, Allah addresses the peaceful soul in the following words: 89:27 ŸäŸéÿß ÿ£ŸéŸäŸéŸëÿ™ŸèŸáŸéÿß ÿßŸÑŸÜŸéŸëŸÅŸíÿ≥Ÿè ÿßŸÑŸíŸÖŸèÿ∑ŸíŸÖŸéÿ¶ŸêŸÜŸéŸëÿ©Ÿè : YƒÅ ayyatuhƒÅ alnnafsu almutmainnatu : O thou human being that hast attained to inner peace! 89:28 ÿßÿ±Ÿíÿ¨ŸêÿπŸêŸä ÿ•ŸêŸÑŸéŸâ ÿ±Ÿéÿ®ŸêŸëŸÉŸê ÿ±Ÿéÿßÿ∂ŸêŸäŸéÿ©Ÿã ŸÖŸéŸëÿ±Ÿíÿ∂ŸêŸäŸéŸëÿ©Ÿã : Irji'aƒ´ ilƒÅ rabbiki radiyatan mardiyyatan : Return thou unto thy Sustainer, well-pleased [and] pleasing [Him]: 89:29 ŸÅŸéÿßÿØŸíÿÆŸèŸÑŸêŸä ŸÅŸêŸä ÿπŸêÿ®ŸéÿßÿØŸêŸä : FƒÅodkhulƒ´ fƒ´ 'aibƒÅdƒ´ : Enter, then, together with My [other true] servants 89:30 ŸàŸéÿßÿØŸíÿÆŸèŸÑŸêŸä ÿ¨ŸéŸÜŸéŸëÿ™ŸêŸä : WƒÅodkhulƒ´ jannatƒ´ : Yea, enter thou My paradise!\\"  Sufi views  = Maqamat of Tazkiah = The level of human perfection is determined by discipline and effort. Man stands between two extremes, the lowest is below beasts and the highest surpasses the angels. Movement between these extremes is discussed by \`ilm al-akhlaq or the science of ethics. Traditional Muslim philosophers believed that without ethics and purification (tazkiah), mastery over other sciences is not only devoid of value, but obstructs insight. That is why the Sufi saint Bayazid al-Bustami has said that, 'knowledge is the thickest of veils', which prevents man from seeing reality (haqiqah). Sufi Brotherhoods (·π≠arƒ´qa pl. ·π≠uruq) have traditionally been considered training workshops where fundamental elements of tazkiah and its practical applications are taught. Sufis see themselves as seekers (murƒ´d≈´n) and wayfarers (sƒÅlik≈´n) on the path to God. For proper training, murƒ´d≈´n are urged to put themselves under the guidance of a master (murshid). The search for God (irƒÅda, ·π≠alab) and the wayfaring (sul≈´k) on the path (·π≠arƒ´q) involve a gradual inner and ethical transformation through various stages. Although some have considerably more, most orders adopted seven maqƒÅmƒÅt (maqam pl. maqamat, a station on the voyage towards spiritual transformation). Although some of these stations are ascetical in nature, their primary functions are ethical, psychological and educational: they are designed as a means for combating the lower-self (mujƒÅhadat al-nafs) and as a tool for its training and education (riyƒÅ·∏çat al-nafs). In one of the earliest authoritative texts of Sufism, the KitƒÅb al-luma‚Äô, Abu Nasr al-Sarraj al-Tusi (d. 988), mentions seven maqƒÅmƒÅt that have become famous in later movements, they include: *Repentance (tawbah): Begins with nur-e-ma'rifat (light of Divine Recognition) in the heart that realizes sin is spiritual poison. This induces regret and a yearning to compensate for past shortcomings and determination to avoid them in the future. Tawbah means regaining one's essential purity after every spiritual defilement. Maintaining this psychological state requires certain essential elements. The first is self- examination (muhasabah) and the other is introversion or meditation (muraqabah). *Abstention (wara): Pious self-restraint: the highest level of wara' is to eschew anything that might distract one, even briefly, from the consciousness of Allah . Some Sufis define wara as conviction of the truth of Islamic tenets, being straightforward in belief and acts, steadfast in observing Islamic commandments, and careful in one's relations with God. *Asceticism (zuhd): Doing without what you do not need and making do with little. It is the emptiness of the heart that doesn't know any other commitment than what is in relation to God, or coldness of the heart and dislike of the soul in relation to the world.Ibn Agibah, Glossaire du Soufisme Such renowned Sufi leaders as Sufyan al-Thawri regarded zuhd as the action of the heart dedicated to Allah's approval and pleasure and closed to worldly ambitions.M. Fethullah Gulen, Key concepts in the practice of Sufism *Poverty (faqr): Poverty, both material and spiritual. This means denial of the nafs demands for pleasure and power, and dedication to the service of others instead of self-promotion. A dervish is also known as a fakir, literally a poor person. Poverty means lack of attachment to possessions and a heart that is empty of all except the desire for Allah . *Patience (·π£abr): Essential characteristic for the mystic, sabr literally means enduring, bearing, and resisting pain and difficulty. There are three types: sabr alal amal (consistent in practicing righteous deeds); sabr fil amal (patience in performing a righteous deed); sabr anil amal (patience in abstaining from haram). In many Quranic verses Allah praises the patient ones, declares His love for them, or mentions the ranks He has bestowed on them: \\"And Surely God is with the patient ones.\\" (2:153) *Confidence (tawakkul): At this stage we realize everything we have comes from Allah . We rely on Allah instead of this world. There are three fundamental principles (arkan) of tawakkul: ma'rifat, halat and a'mal. The condition for achieving tawakkul is sincere acknowledgement of tauheed. *Contentment (ri·∏çƒÅ‚Äô): Submission to qa·∏çƒÅ (fate), showing no rancor or rebellion against misfortune, and accepting all manifestations of Destiny without complaint. According to Dhul-Nun al-Misri, rida means preferring God's wishes over one's own in advance, accepting his Decree without complaint, based on the realization that whatever God wills and does is good.Al-Qushayri, Al-Risala, p. 195 The state where pain is not felt is called ri·∏çƒÅ-e-tab'i (natural): when ri·∏çƒÅ‚Äô prevails with pain it is ri·∏çƒÅ-e- aqli (intellectual). The first state is a physical condition and is not incumbent. The second is an intellectual condition, which is required: results from muhabbat (love for Allah ). Sufi sheikhs such as 'AlƒÅ' al-Dawlah SimnƒÅni have described the maqƒÅmƒÅt in terms of the 'seven prophets' of one's inner being, with each prophet corresponding to one of man's inner states and also virtues.H. Corbin, 'Physiologie de l'homme de lumiere dans le soufisme iranien,' Paris 1959 pp. 238 Others like KhwƒÅjah 'Abdallah AnsƒÅri have gone into great detail in dividing the stages of tazkiah into a hundred stations. Nonetheless, through all these descriptions the main features of the stations marking the journey towards Allah are the same. One of the finest accounts of maqƒÅmƒÅt in Sufism is the Forty Stations (MaqƒÅmƒÅt-i Arba'in), written by the eleventh century murshid Ab≈´-Sa'ƒ´d Abul-Khayr.Hussein Nasr, Sufi Essays =MƒÅmulƒÅt of Tazkiah= In order to combat and train the lower-self, Sufis practice fasting (·π£awm), food and drink deprivation (j≈´ ø'), wakefulness at night for the recitation of Quranic passages (qiyƒÅm al-layl), periods of seclusion (khalawƒÅt), roaming uninhabited places in states of poverty and deprivation, and lengthy meditations (murƒÅqaba, jam' al-hamm). The effortful path of self-denial and transformation through gradual maqƒÅmƒÅt is interwoven with effortless mystical experiences (a·∏•wƒÅl).Jewish Virtual Library The Persian murshid Abu al-Najib al-Suhrawardi further described this process by saying that it is only through constancy in action for God ('aml li- allƒÅh), remembrance (dhikr allƒÅh), recitation from the Quran, prayers and meditation (muraqabah) that a mystic can hope to obtain his objective, which is ubudiyyah ‚Äì perfect obedience to Allah. Another practice that is often associated with Sufism is the spiritual concert, or \\"listening,\\" samƒÅ', in which poetic recitations, music and dances are performed by the participants, sometimes in states of ecstasy and elation. Most Sufi ·π≠uruq have established graded programs in which initially every new seeker (murƒ´d≈´n) is educated in the ritual known as zikr-al-lisani (zikr with the tongue) and is finally taught zikr-al-qalbi, which is practiced from the onset.Sufism and Sufi Orders in Islam More About Ahwal Excerpt from book reviews provided by \\"Der Nimatullahi Sufi-Orden\\", \\"Spiritual Poverty in Sufism Spiritual Poverty is a cornerstone of classical Sufi practice. The term faqir (poor man or woman) is often used as a synonym for Sufi and darvish among the Sufis. The first essay in this book documents the development of the meaning of spiritual poverty in Sufism, followed by two essays which explore diverse definitions of the terms darvish and Sufi in Islamic mystical texts. Chapters 4 and 5 constitute the only comprehensive study in English of the various gradations of mystical states (ahwal) and the hierarchical levels of spiritual stations (maqamat) by the Sufis. The final chapters focus on the concept of the 'Eternal Now' (waqt) and discuss the significance of breath in the spiritual method of the Sufis.\\" 'Al- Ghunya li-Talibi Tariq al-Haqq ‚Äì 2', in 'Concerning contentment [rida].', says \\"Should contentment [rida] be classed as one of the spiritual states [ahwal], or as one of the spiritual stations [maqamat]?\\", and in another place later, same work, \\"But its final stage [nihaya] is one of the spiritual states [ahwal]...\\" These quotes are without going into detail, such as to answer the question presented. The webpage entitled 'SUFISM', says, The Sufi path contains many stages (Maqamat) and states (Ahwal). It begins with repentance when the seeker joins the order and prepares himself for initiation.... He passes through a number of spiritual stations and states clearly defined by Sufi teaching. These are the Sufi stations: ... Linked to these stations are specific moods or emotions (ahwal) such as fear and hope, sadness and joy, yearning and intimacy... SUFI ESOTERIC TERMINOLOGY: Ahwal ‚Äì mystical states. With a translation of Ahwal: Qasida Burda verses 35‚Äì36 Wa-'alaykum as-Salam wa-rahmatullah wa-barakatuh: What is the meaning of \\"muqtahim[i]\\" in the line of the Burda Shareef which states: \\"Li kulli hawlin min ahwal muqtahimi\\"? Also, what is the translation of \\"Abara fee qawli laa minhu wa la n'ami\\"? They are verses 35‚Äì36: Nabiyyuna al-aamiru al-naahi fa-la ahadun abarra fi qawli \\"la\\" minhu wa-la \\"na'ami.\\" Huwa al-Habibu al-ladhi turja shafa'atuhu, li-kulli hawlin min al-ahwali muqtahimi! Translation Our Prophet who commands and forbids, so that none is more just than him in saying \\"no\\" or \\"yes\\": He is the Beloved whose intercession is dearly hoped, for each disaster of the disasters that shall befall!\\" As can be seen, in the last line starting with 'hawlin', the corresponding translation starts with 'disaster', then, 'of the disasters', whereas the initial text, \\"min al-ahwali\\"; thereof, it is shown basic lughatul Arabiya [Arabic language], the word tense of 'hawlin' to 'al- ahwali'. Article on Qa·π£ƒ´da al-Burda (Arabic: ŸÇÿµŸäÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±ÿØÿ©, \\"Poem of the Mantle\\") Quote provided is on direct subject of illustrating the breadth of translations of Ahwal; therewith, the quote is inserted without involvement in unanimity of agreement of approval of the entirety of the content of Qasida Burda. Further on meanings of Ahwal, in answering, \\"Question: Does a non- verbal pronouncement of divorce count as a pronouncement of divorce? i.e. The man \\"says\\" it \\"aloud\\" in his mind (without moving lips, vocal cords, mouth)? Answer: ÿ®ÿ≥ŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸäŸÖ Assalamu Alaykum. Allama Muhammad Qudri Basha in his al-Ahwal al-Shaksiyya mentions: A divorce is effected by a verbal pronouncement and by a formally written letter. (Al-Fawaid al-Aliyya ala al- Ahkam al-Shariyya fi al-Ahwal al-Shakhsiyya, Article 222, Maktaba Arafa). A formally written letter is one that is written to a third person. This will count as a divorce whether one intends it or not.\\" It is indicative that al- Ahwal is used in places, places, spread. The purpose of including this in this article addendum is for broadness sake.  Salafi views  Although highly critical of numerous Sufi practices, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab states: > \\"We do not negate the way of the Sufis and the purification of the inner > self (i.e., tazkiah) from the vices of those sins connected to the heart and > the limbs as long as the individual firmly adheres to the rules of Shari‚Äòah > and the correct and observed way.

The Ardea and (at right) Atwater Place in 2016. In the background at left is the Mirabella Portland tower. The South Waterfront is a high-rise district under construction on former brownfield industrial land in the South Portland neighborhood south of downtown Portland, Oregon, U.S. It is one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in the United States. It is connected to downtown Portland by the Portland Streetcar and MAX Orange Line (at South Waterfront/SW Moody Station), and to the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) main campus atop Marquam Hill by the Portland Aerial Tram, as well as roads to Interstate 5 and Oregon Route 43. Description and history The South Waterfront is part of the Portland Development Commission's North Macadam Urban Renewal District. The first phase of the South Waterfront is the $1.9 billion \\"River Blocks\\" development. Construction began in early 2004. The full build-out of the district envisions many residential (primarily condominiums) and medical research towers ranging in height from 6 stories to 35+ stories. As of August 2010, nine towers have been completed in the district: the 16-story OHSU Center for Health & Healing, the twin condominium towers known as the Meriwether, at 21 and 24 stories, the 31-story John Ross Tower condominium, the 22-story Atwater Place condominium tower, the 31-story apartments The Ardea, the 22-story Riva on the Park, the 30-story Mirabella Portland, the Matisse, and Gray's Landing. The Mirabella is the district's first senior living community. A linear park called South Waterfront Greenway, running along the west bank of the Willamette River, is partially completed. The district currently has its own park between the Riva on the Park and OHSU. The Gibbs Street Pedestrian Bridge, which opened in July 2012, connects the South Waterfront District with Lair Hill over I-5. The Tilikum Crossing, Bridge of the People, a new TriMet bridge for the MAX Orange Line that carries only pedestrians, bicyclists and public transit vehicles between the South Waterfront and Hosford-Abernethy, opened on September 12, 2015. In addition to residences, the district contains restaurants, grocery, retail, and service businesses, with more in the planning stages. Construction of three new OHSU buildings in the district is scheduled to begin in 2016, and the university has earmarked $500 million for the work, which is expected to take about two years. Together with the existing OHSU Center for Health & Healing, the new facilities will be part of the Knight Cancer Institute, which also has facilities outside the South Waterfront. The largest of the buildings will be for patient medical care, another will be for research and administration, and the third will provide housing for patients and their families.

It was syndicated nationally for another seven years. Beginning The show began when Norman, a onetime child prodigy who had been playing and composing music since she was 3 years of age, contacted one of her professors from Temple University, working at what was then WFIL and is now WPVI-TV about a possible children's program featuring a Peter Pan-like character. Though there were no openings available at WFIL, he suggested she go to the then CBS owned-and-operated station WCAU-TV. She walked in with no appointment and described the show to the Program Director. Within three weeks, the show was on the air. Features Norman appeared on the show as a \\"pixie\\" with a green outfit, tights and a hat with a feather. She worked out a method of \\"flying\\" using a similar apparatus to that which Mary Martin had used as Peter Pan, but with only one wire supporting her instead of the several that had harnessed Martin on stage. She remembers that perfecting the technique was quite painful, but it proved so effective as to be maintained for the entire run of the program. The supporting cast of puppets included Oggie Owl, Fliffy Butterfly, Herkimer, Tearesa, Galumpagus, Dandy Lion, and the puppets of Addis Williams. Pixanne had at least two alter-egos as well ‚Äî one was a witch called Windy, whom Norman also acted out. Guest appearances included singer Tiny Tim. Songs Norman sang on the show included \\"Swinging on a Star,\\" \\"If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake,\\" \\"I've Gotta Crow\\" from the 1954 musical Peter Pan, \\"Look at That Face\\" from the musical The Roar of the Greasepaint - The Smell of the Crowd, and \\"Beautiful Things\\" from the 1967 movie Doctor Dolittle.\\"Pixanne TV Show,\\" YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdxUulN97cg The show's background music included Maurice Ravel's Le Tombeau de Couperin and a selection from Carl Orff's Music for Children, the theme of Pixanne's daily cartoon introduction with her march with a magical flag. On the show, Norman also introduced adventure films and made children's crafts, such as puppets and hats. Pixanne received ratings of 10-12 and a 62% share of audience near the end of its run. Cancellation and syndication When WCAU management changed in 1969, the new management took Pixanne off the air, much to the protests of millions of viewers. But the show soon came back in syndication, with WNEW-TV in New York as the flagship station. The show went off the air in 1976. Norman's later career Jane Norman went on to produce family-oriented network television shows, including The National Kids‚Äô Quiz, which Michael Landon moderated on NBC. She also wrote a 1981 book with Dr. Myron Harris, The Private Life of the American Teenager, and appeared on more than 95 radio and television talk shows to promote it. The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Norman into their Hall of Fame 2005. Norman died at her home in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania on May 13, 2017, aged 83.

Early life Joy Maureen Denalane was born in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg to a Black South African father and a German mother, but grew up in the Berlin district of Kreuzberg. At the age of sixteen, Denalane left home and focused on her music, joining the reggae and soul bands Culture Roots and Family Affair. At nineteen she was signed to a major pop music label, but she and her management could not agree on what her music and image should be like and Denalane soon asked to be released. Afterwards, she moved to Stuttgart, where she met DJ Thomilla and Tiefschwarz (two already well-known producers active in the Kolchose), with whom she wrote and produced the club hit \\"Music\\". Career =1999‚Äî2005: Debut and Mamani= Denalane on-stage with Freundeskreis at the Gurtenfestival in Bern, Switzerland in 2000. Around the same time, Denalane came in first contact with hip hop group Freundeskreis, who searched for a female counterpart to lead singer Max Herre's voice on their track \\"Mit Dir\\" then. However, the duet was released as a single in July 1999 and made the top ten in Germany, the top thirty in Austria, and the top fifteen in Switzerland‚Äîpushed by the fact Denalane and Herre had become a couple. Afterwards Denalane joined the FK Allstars, which also consisted of Afrob, Gentleman, Sekou, and Brooke Russell, among others, and went on tour with them for more than two years. Later on she signed a contract with Four Music (founded by Die Fantastischen Vier) and began working on her debut album Mamani, which was released in June 2002 and debuted at number eight on the German Albums Chart. Inspired by African roots, the album was primarily produced by husband Max Herre. In total Mamani spawned six singles, including the lead single \\"Sag's Mir\\", the socially critical track \\"Im Ghetto von Soweto\\" (featuring her uncle South African flugelhorn legend Hugh Masekela), and \\"Kinderlied\\", a song dedicated to her oldest son Isaiah. In 2003 Denalane went on a solo tour and finished collaborations with Youssou N'Dour, ASD, and Till Br√∂nner. She also performed in New York City and Philadelphia for the first time and eventually received a Comet for Best Hip-Hop/R&B; National and three ECHO nominations, including Best Female Artist. Soon after she released a live edition of Mamani on CD and DVD, which was recorded during a special performance at Berlin's Tr√§nenpalast and involved a set of previously unreleased remakes. In summer 2005 Denalane contributed vocals to the German version of Common's 2005 single \\"Go!\\". =2006‚Äî2015: Born and Raised and Maureen= In April 2006, Denalane and Herre founded their own label, Nesola. Simultaneously Denalane prepared the release of her second album, Born & Raised, her first record in English. Pre-programmed in Germany, the album was entirely recorded in Philadelphia and features appearances by American rappers Lupe Fiasco, Raekwon, and Governor. While its lead single \\"Let Go\\" reached a moderately successful number forty on the German Singles Chart, the critically acclaimed Born & Raised (released on 11 August 2006) debuted at number two (behind Christina Aguilera's Back to Basics) on the national albums chart, making it Denalane's highest chart entry to date. Further singles from the album, \\"Heaven or Hell\\" and \\"Sometimes Love\\", failed to chart within the top one hundred. In spring 2007 Denalane released the single \\"Change\\" (featuring Lupe Fiasco) in the United Kingdom, but it failed to chart, however it was featured in the 2008 blockbuster film, Taken, starring Liam Neeson. In 2008, Joy Denalane worked with Tweet, Dwele and Bilal on the project The Dresden Soul Symphony in Dresden, Germany. They performed classic soul cuts like \\"Let's stay together\\", \\"Natural woman\\", \\"It's a man¬¥s man¬¥s man's world\\", \\"Ain¬¥t nothing like a real thing\\" etc. with the MDR Symphony Orchestra. An album The Dresden Soul Symphony and DVD were later released on 24 October 2008. Denalane's third studio Maureen, titled after her middle name, was released May 2011. Her first German-language studio album since Mamani (2002), it received a positive response from critics and reached number eight on the German Albums Chart. Elsewhere the album peaked at number thirty-six in Austria and number eleven on the Swiss Albums Chart, becoming both her highest and lowest-charting album yet, respectively. Spawning four singles, an English language version of Maureen was released in March 2012. In August 2014, Denalane became a judge on the debut season of the RTL reality program, Rising Star along with Sasha, Gentleman, and Anastacia. =2016‚Äîpresent: Gleisdreieck and Let Yourself Be Loved= In 2017, Denalane released her fourth studio album, Gleisdreieck, her third German-language album.

It is located on Signal Hill, overlooking the Tsuu T'ina Nation (formerly Sarcee Nation), as well as lands formerly known as Camp Sarcee and later Sarcee Training Area, a military reserve used by the Canadian Forces from before the First World War up until the 1990s. The park extends over an area of , north of the Elbow River. Its heritage value is associated with its dedication to the heroic efforts of Albertan soldiers during the First World War. The site contains four geoglyphs, numbered 137, 113, 151, and 51. The large, whitewashed stones, totalling 16,000 in all, form the centrepiece of the park. Arranged on the side of the hill, and visible from various parts of the city, they represent the battalions numbered 137th, 113th, 151st, and 51st. Geography The park on Signal Hill overlooks the Tsuut ºina Nation. It is situated to the north of the Elbow River, beside the Westhills shopping complex, on the city's western outskirts. History =Early history= The then-Sarcee Indian Reserve leased a part of their land in the summer of 1914 to the Canadian Militia to enable them to establish a prospective training site for military personnel. It was then known as Sarcee Camp (as it overlooks what was then called the Sarcee Nation), and it was an exclusive area in Alberta to provide training to the soldiers who were to be assigned to fight during the First World War. The military reserve was used by the Canadian Forces from before the First World War up until the 1990s. In all, 45,000 men were trained at the military camp. With this strength, the camp was the largest military training establishment in Canada during the war time. The 30 various units, housed in tents, included trainees drawn from various parts of the province. From Fort Calgary, it took a day's ride to approach the camp. Army engineers mapped the area. Each unit established its identity within its prescribed area by using stones that were hauled in sacks by hand from the river by soldiers as part of their training programme, over a distance of during off-duty hours. Several military units collaborated in collecting the stones to create the battalion numerals. They were gathered from the river and carried it to the site as part of the training exercies. Among those who did so were the four battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (Members of the Calgary, Lethbridge, Central Alberta, and Edmonton battalions) who were trained in the area. 51st Battalion, Sarcee Army Camp in 1915 After their training was over, the battalions were assigned to war regions abroad to fight in the First World War. The 151st (Central Alberta) Battalion, raised in the Red Deer, Battle River, and South Edmonton districts, trained at the Sarcee Camp from December 22, 1915, until October 4, 1916; Lieutenant-Colonel J.W. Arnott commanded. The 137th (Calgary) Battalion, CEF, which was composed of the men of \\"Calgary's Own\\", were trained in the Sarcee Camp from December 1915 to August 1916; they were commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel George W. Morfitt. On August 21, 1916, they embarked to Europe to participate in the war. They were amalgamated with the 21st Reserve Battalion for service. Those men who survived the war met at the park, till the 1960s, to carry out weeding operations and also to repaint the stones of their battalion number which they had erected. The 113th Battalion (Lethbridge Highlanders), CEF, consisted of 883 men and officers who were trained at the Sarcee Camp from late May 1916 until September. The battalion used painted rocks to construct their battalion number on Signal Hill. The 51st Battalion (Edmonton), CEF, under the command of Colonel Harwood, was also at the Sarcee Army Camp, in 1915. =Later history= With the battalions gone, the numbers were almost forgotten, overgrown by shrubs and grass. The stones were almost obscured till a local historian found them; he found the stones prior to grading as part of a protection strategy for the hill which was subject to erosion, and to enable construction activity in the area. Getting the site its present historical status involved concerted efforts by the cadets of units, particularly of the 157th Battalion, stationed in Calgary; this effort stretched to several years of pursuing with the authorities. The stones were safely kept by Stewart Green Properties Ltd until they were restored. Development involved work on a gravel pit by Richmond Road, slope grading, rock replacement, and stairs construction. Battalion Park officially opened on 3 November 1991. The 51st Battalion is perpetuated by an existing reserve unit, the Loyal Edmonton Regiment. The 137th Battalion is perpetuated by another reserve unit, the King's Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC). The 151st Battalion was perpetuated by the North Alberta Regiment, which disbanded in 1936, and the 113th Battalion of the Lethbridge Highlanders is perpetuated by the South Alberta Light Horse. Features The glyphs, which form the centre piece of the park, are large whitewashed stones (16,000 of them), arranged on the side of the hill and represent the battalions numbers 137, 113, 151, and 51. The numbers, serif- type numerals, were created using 16,000 stones. While the numerals 137, 151, and 51 are in a cluster, the glyph representing number \\"113\\" is further away in an undisturbed state as made in-situ initially from July 1, 1916, to August 31, 1916, but located within the park. Number \\"113\\" is at its original location, on a high ridge, while the others had to be shifted from their original location to the present site because of the need to develop the area for roads and other economic activities. The glyph with number \\"113\\" is located on area of land on a high ridge, and each numeral of \\"113\\" measures in length and in width. The number is made up of white-painted stones. The park consists of a walkway up the hill along paved and mud paths with several interpretative displays of the numerals and a \\"lookout landing\\". Commemoration In a homage paid by 104 cadets who gathered at the Battalion Park Monument, a plaque was erected as dedication to their ancestors who were part of the action during 1915 and 1916 in the First World War. The names of the battalions are mentioned on the plaque. On this occasion they also painted the stones which mark the numbers of the battalions. The units involved in its assembly, mentioned on the plaque, are: 85 RCSCC Calgary, 604 Moose Squadron RCAC, 22 Undaunted RGSCC, 781 Calgary Squadron, RCAC 1292 LdSH (RC), RCACC 2554, PPCLI CC 1955, Service Battalion RCACC, Buffalo Squadron 538, RCAC 2509, Royal Cdn Signals, CC 2137 Calgary Highlanders, and CC 52 City of Calgary Squadron RCCA. Members of The King's Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC), who perpetuate the 137th (Calgary) Battalion CEF, commemorate the sacrifices of their fallen comrades each Remembrance Day by sending a contingent to the memorial and conducting a ceremony of remembrance.

Founded in the 8th CE, it has been on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative list since 2004.Baltit Fort UNESCO Tentative List - official website. Retrieved 05 October 2014. In the past, the survival of the feudal regime of Hunza was ensured by the impressive fort, which overlooks Karimabad. The foundations of the fort date back to 700 years ago, with rebuilds and alterations over the centuries. In the 16th century the local prince married a princess from Baltistan who brought master Balti craftsmen to renovate the building as part of her dowry. The Mirs of Hunza abandoned the fort in 1945, and moved to a new palace down the hill. The fort started to decay which caused concern that it might possibly fall into ruin. Following a survey by the Royal Geographical Society of London a restoration programme was initiated and supported by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture Historic Cities Support Programme. The programme was completed in 1996 and the fort is now a museum run by the Baltit Heritage Trust. Historical background The fort offers panoramic views over the Hunza Valley. The Karakoram mountains tower above the fort The fort's interior Ibex skulls are hung to signify the fort as a seat of royal power In the past several small independent states formed part of the history of the Northern Areas of Pakistan. Among them Hunza and Nager were traditional rival states, situated on opposite sides of the Hunza (Kanjut) river. The rulers of these two states, Mirs known as Thum (also Tham, Thom or Th√°mo), built various strongholds to consolidate their power. According to historical sources,Tarikh-e-Ehd Atiiq Riyasat Hunza, Haji Qudrarullah Baig, S.T.Printers, Rawalpindi 1980, Pakistan the Hunza rulers initially resided in nearby Altit Fort, but after a conflict between the two sons of the ruler Sultan, Shah Abbas (ShŒ¨boos) and Ali Khan (AliqhŒ¨n), Shaboos moved to Baltit Fort, making it the capital seat of Hunza. The power struggle between the two brothers eventually resulted in the death of younger one, and so Baltit Fort became the prime seat of power in the Hunza state. The fort's construction and design were influenced by those in Tibet. Ayasho II, Thum/Mir of Hunza in the early 15th fifteenth century married Princess Shah Khatoon (Sha Qhatun) from Baltistan (in Moghul history Baltistan is called Tibet Khurd, which means Little Tibet), and was the first to modify the face of Altit and, subsequently Baltit Fort. Baltistan had a very strong cultural and ethnical relation with the Ladakh territory to the east. Not surprisingly, the structure of Baltit Fort was influenced by Ladakhi/Tibetan architecture, with some resemblance to the Potala Palace in Lhasa. Then additions, renovations and changes to the building were being made through the centuries by a long line of following rulers of Hunza. Home of many ancient forts, the Northern Areas of Pakistan lost some of its heritage around the 19th century as a result of attacks by the Maharaja of Kashmir. However, one of the biggest changes in the structure of the Baltit Fort came with the invasion of the British in December 1891. Safdarali Khan, ruler of Hunza and his (Wazir Dadu) (Thara Baig III), fled to befriended Kashgar (China) to seek 'political asylum' with their fellows and families. With the conquest of Hunza and Nager states the fortified wall and watch towers of the old Baltit village and watch towers of the Baltit Fort on its north-western end were demolished as required by the British. They installed his younger brother, Sir Muhammad Nazim Khan K.C.I.E, as the ruler of Hunza state in September 1892.History of Northern Areas of Pakistan by Prof. A.H.Dani, Page:285 Pub: Sang-e-Meel Publications, Lahore Pakistan www.sang-e-meel.com, Reprinted: 2007 During his reign, Nazeem Khan made several major alterations to the Baltit Fort. He demolished a number of rooms of third floor and added a few rooms in the British colonial style on the front elevation, using lime wash and colour glass panel windows. Baltit Fort remained officially inhabited until 1945, when the last ruler of Hunza, Mir Muhammad Jamal Khan, moved to a new palatial house further down the hill, where the present Mir of Hunza, Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan, and his family are still residing. Conservation Rear view of the fort With no proper authority entrusted the Fort was exposed to the ravages of time and over the years its structure weakened and began to deteriorate. His Highness Aga Khan IV initiated the restoration efforts for Baltit Fort in 1990, when Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan and his family generously transferred the Fort to the Baltit Heritage Trust, a public charity formed for the explicit purpose of owning and maintaining the Fort. The restoration undertaken by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture in Geneva in association with the Aga Khan Cultural Service Pakistan (Pakistan), took six years to complete. The project was supported by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture as the main donor through its Historic Cities Support Programme, as well as by the Getty Grant Program (USA), the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation and the French Government. The restored Fort, resplendent in its formal regal glory, was inaugurated on 29 September 1996 in the presence of His Highness the Aga Khan IV and the president of Pakistan Farooq Ahmad Khan Laghari. It is now operated and maintained by the Baltit Heritage Trust and is open to visitors. The Baltit Fort serves as a good example of culture restored and preserved for future generations.

Early life and family background  Beachy was born near Salisbury, Somerset County, Pennsylvania. He was ordained a minister in the Amish church on 1912 May 19 and ordained a bishop in that church on 1916 October 1. His father, two brothers, and two sons were also Amish ministers. In 1927, he was involved in the church division that led to formation of the Beachy Amish congregations.  Amish Mennonite division  The Amish Mennonite division had its roots in differences among church leaders over a strict interpretation of the streng meidung, or strong ban, shunning, or avoidance of members under church discipline, which had come to effectively excommunicate church members who left the stricter Pennsylvania district of the church in order to transfer to the less strict Maryland district. Beachy favored a more moderate position. Since he was not united on this issue with other ministers and the retired bishop of his own congregation, he considered resigning his office, but was urged by at least one minister not to do so. Unlike many Amish congregations which meet in homes, Amish church meetings in Somerset County were conducted in church buildings, customarily meeting at two alternating locations on different Sundays, but on 1927 June 26, after a decade or more of tension over the streng meidung issue, the more conservative group and the formerly retired bishop met at the Summit Mills meetinghouse, even though Beachy had previously announced that services were to be held that Sunday at the Flag Run meetinghouse. Effectively, there were now two congregations where previously there had been one, though they continued to share the same two church buildings on alternate Sundays.  Amish Mennonite fellowship  The new congregation under Moses Beachy gradually became known by the name of its bishop, a nomenclature that was not uncommon, especially when church groups met at different locations and could not assume the name of a particular place. Other Amish congregations that identified with the issues leading to the formation of the Beachy congregation started to ally themselves into a new church fellowship group, and this larger grouping also came to be called Beachy Amish, though in some areas they were known as Amish Mennonite or as Fellowship churches. Moses Beachy and John A. Stoltzfus, bishop of a group that had divided from the Old Order Amish of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, began a practice of visiting one another's churches in 1929, and their two congregations became leaders in the growing Beachy Amish Mennonite fellowship of churches.For a more detailed discussion of the 1927 split and its history, see Rise and development of the Beachy Amish Mennonite churches . The author, Alvin J. Beachy (1913‚Äì1986), was Moses' eleventh child.  Amicable relations in spite of differences  Despite the failure of those involved in the 1927 church division to resolve their differences, there was mutual agreement by them on shared use of the two church meetinghouses, and for many years the two groups continued to meet at alternating locations, helping to equalize the travel distance by members who lived over a widely dispersed area. In 1928, the new Beachy congregation approved the use of automobiles, and in another year electricity and telephones, something that immediately distinguished them from the Old Order Amish, for whom travel is typically conducted by horse and carriage, and have been more selective in their adaptation to modern technology. Even though one church group now drove automobiles, the shared, amicable ownership and use of two church buildings continued until 1953, seven years after the death of Moses Beachy, when the Beachy Amish group constructed a more modern building and called themselves Mountain View Fellowship.  Later life  Moses Beachy married Lucy S. Miller on February 17, 1895 and they had 14 children. Lucy died 1927 November 25. Moses married Mary E. Hershberger on November 12, 1928. He died on July 7, 1946, at the age of 71.

Apart from its use as a game engine, it is mainly used in the enterprise area: simulators, virtual reality systems, serious games and visualization. A distinguishing feature of Unigine is support for large open worlds, up to the planet scale. It also has an advanced 3D renderer that currently supports OpenGL 4 and DirectX 11. An updated Unigine SDK is released every three months. Unigine Engine is a core technology for a lineup of benchmarks (CPU, GPU, power supply, cooling system), which are used by overclockers and technical media: Tom's Hardware, Linus Tech Tips, PC Gamer, JayzTwoCents, and others. Unigine benchmarks are also included as part of the Phoronix Test Suite for benchmarking purposes on Linux and other systems.  UNIGINE 1  The first public release was 0.3 version on May 4, 2005. UNIGINE Engine was created from scratch and is not based on any other engine. The last update has been released on July 7, 2014. =Platforms= Initially started with only Microsoft Windows and Linux support, more platforms were added later: OS X, PlayStation 3, Android, iOS. Experimental support for WebGL was not included into the official SDK. UNIGINE 1 had support for several graphical APIs: DirectX 9, DirectX 10, DirectX 11, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, PlayStation 3. Initial versions (v0.3x) had only OpenGL support. There are 3 APIs for developers: C++, C#, UnigineScript (proprietary scripting language, similar to –°++ in syntax). Custom shaders can be written in GLSL and HLSL languages. = Serious game features = UNIGINE 1 has several features required by professional simulators and enterprise VR systems (mostly support for large virtual scenarios and specific hardware), often called serious games. Support for large virtual worlds was implemented via double precision of coordinates (64-bit per axis), zone-based background data streaming, and optional operations in geographic coordinate system (latitude, longitude, and elevation instead of X, Y, Z). Video output to sophisticated displays was implemented via so-called multi-channel rendering (network- synchronized image generation of a single large image with several computers), which is a standard approach in professional simulators.https://www.nads- sc.uiowa.edu/dscna/2005/papers/An_Image_Generator_PC- cluster_High_Flexible_Multi-simulator.pdf The same system enabled support of multiple output devices with asymmetric projections (e.g. CAVE). Curved screens with multiple projectors (requiring image warping and edge blending) were also supported. Also, various types of stereoscopic 3D output were supported: anaglyph, separate images output, Nvidia 3D Vision, as well as VR HMD support (Oculus Rift). Unigine 1 also supported multi-monitor output (video-walls). =Other features= Unigine renderer supports shader model 5.0 with hardware tessellation and DirectCompute (as well as OpenCL), together with a set of post-processes, including screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO), and real-time global illumination. There is a set of built-in high-level objects like terrain, grass, water, clouds and so on. Unigine uses a proprietary physics engine (collision detection, rigid body physics, dynamical destruction of objects, rag doll, cloth, fluid buoyancy, force fields, time reverse). Pathfinding is also implemented with a proprietary engine, together with basic AI components (spatial triggers, callbacks). Other features includes interactive 3D GUI, video playback using Theora codec, 3D audio system based on OpenAL library, WYSIWYG scene editor (UnigineEditor).  UNIGINE 2  Originally released on October 10, 2015. Unigine 2 has all features from Unigine 1, with further focus on simulators and enterprise use. The main differences are the transition from forward rendering to deferred rendering approach, PBR shading, and introduction of several new graphical technologies like geometry water, multi-layered volumetric clouds, SSRTGI, and voxel-based lighting, and introduction of C# API. =Platforms= Supported platforms: Microsoft Windows, Linux, OS X (support stopped starting from 2.6 version). UNIGINE 2 supports the following graphical APIs: DirectX 11, OpenGL 4.x. There are 3 APIs for developers: C++, C#, UnigineScript. Supported shader languages: HLSL, GLSL, UUSL (Unified Unigine Shader Language). =SSRTGI= Proprietary SSRTGI (Screen Space Ray-Traced Global Illumination) rendering technology was introduced in 2.5 version. It was presented at SIGGRAPH 2017 Real-Time Live! event.  Development  The roots of Unigine are in the frustum.org open source project, which was initiated in 2002 by Alexander \\"Frustum\\" Zaprjagaev, who is a co-founder (along with Denis Shergin, CEO) and ex-CTO of Unigine Corp. = Linux game competition = On November 25, 2010, Unigine Corp announced a competition to support Linux game development. They agreed to give away a free license of the Unigine engine to anyone willing to develop and release a game with a Linux native client, and would also grant the team a Windows license. The competition ran until December 10, 2010, with a considerable number of entries being submitted. Due to the unexpected response, Unigine decided to extend the offer to the three best applicants, with each getting full Unigine licenses. The winners were announced on December 13, 2010, with the developers selected being Kot-in-Action Creative Artel (who previously developed Steel Storm), Gamepulp (who intend to make a puzzle platformer), and MED-ART (who previously worked on Painkiller: Resurrection).  Unigine-based projects  As of 2019 company claimed to have more than 200 B2B customers worldwide.https://unigine.com/en/company/customers They primarily use Unigine for military and Virtual Reality projects. Several notable projects include graphical benchmarks and CAD systems. = Games = ;Released * Cradle - released for Windows and Linux in 2015 *Oil Rush - released for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X in 2012 *Syndicates of Arkon - released for Windows in 2010 *Tryst - released for Windows in 2012 *Petshop \\\\- released for Windows and Mac, featuring web-player in 2011 *Sumoman \\\\- released for Windows and Linux in 2017 (Steam page) *Demolicious - released for iOS in 2012 * Dual Universe - MMO RPG on a planetary scale (currently in Beta, full release planned for 2021) ;Upcoming * Relics of Annorath MMO, ceased Production in 2017 * Dilogus: The Winds of War * MMT Online \\\\- playable demo available for Windows and Linux * The Dreamers * Node - VR shooter (Steam page) * Kingdom of Kore - action RPG for PC (in future for PS3) - cancelled by publisher * El Somni Quas \\\\- MMORPG (Patreon page) * Jim Bourke Airshow Trainer - flight simulator (Steam pagehttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1024740/Jim_Bourke_Airshow_Trainer/) * Acro FS - aerobatic flight simulator (Steam pagehttps://store.steampowered.com/app/834880/Acro_FS//) = Simulation and visualization = * NAUTIS maritime simulators by VSTEP * Be-200 flight simulatorhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFRjqAkaFQg * Klee 3D (3D visualization solution for digital marketing and research applications) * The visualization component of the analytical software complex developed for JSC \\"ALMAZ-ANTEY\\" MSDB\\", an affiliate of JSC \\"Concern \\"Almaz-Antey\\" * Real-time interactive architectural visualization projects of AI3D * Bell-206 Ranger rescue helicopter simulatorhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQOOQ-KB0Ec * Magus ex Machina (3D animated movie) * SIMREX CDS, SIMREX FDS, SIMREX FTS car driving simulators by INNOSIMULATION * Real-time artworks by John Gerrard (artist): Farm,http://www.johngerrard.net/farm.html Solar Reserve, Exercise, Western Flag (Spindletop, Texas), X. laevis (Spacelab) * Train simulators by SPECTR * DVS3D by GDI * RF-X flight simulator * NAVANTIShttp://www.sepi.es/default.aspx?cmd=0004&IdContent;=36438&idLanguage;=_EN‚ü®= Ship Simulator * VR simulator for learning of computer vision for autonomous flight control at Daedalean AIhttps://unigine.com/en/news/2019/autonomous- flying-cars-will-be-trained-in-unigine-virtual-worlds = Benchmarks = UNIGINE Engine is used as a platform for a series of benchmarks, which can be used to determine the stability of PC hardware (CPU, GPU, power supply, cooling system) under extremely stressful conditions, as well as for overclocking: * Superposition benchmarkhttp://unigine.com/en/products/benchmarks/superposition/ (featuring online leaderboards) - UNIGINE 2 (2017) * Valley benchmarkhttp://unigine.com/en/products/benchmarks/valley/ \\\\- UNIGINE 1 (2013) * Heaven benchmarkhttp://unigine.com/en/products/benchmarks/heaven/ (the first DirectX 11 benchmark) - UNIGINE 1 (2009) * Tropics benchmarkhttp://unigine.com/en/products/benchmarks/tropics/ \\\\- UNIGINE 1 (2008) * Sanctuary benchmarkhttp://unigine.com/en/products/benchmarks/sanctuary/ \\\\- UNIGINE 1 (2007)  References  Computer physics engines Game engines for Linux Middleware Video game engines Virtual reality ","title":"Unigine"},{"id":"4039635","text":"First on the Moon (, Pervye na Lune) is a 2005 Russian mockumentary science fiction film about a fictional 1930s Soviet landing on the Moon. The film, which went on to win many awards, was the debut of the director Aleksei Fedorchenko. Plot A group of journalists are investigating a highly secret document when they uncover a sensational story: that before the Second World War, in 1938, the first rocket was made in the USSR and Soviet scientists were planning to send an orbiter to the Moon and back. The evidence is convincing; it is clear that in this case, Soviet crewed lunar program cosmonauts were first. The movie follows the selection and training of a small group of cosmonauts. The one who shines above the others (similar to the clear front- runners in the early historical Soviet space program) is Captain Ivan Sergeyevich Kharlamov (possibly a reference to the real-life cosmonaut Valentin Varlamov). He is helped into a space suit and loaded into the capsule, and the rocket lifts off for the Moon‚Äîbut contact with it is soon lost. Most of the remainder of the film seems to follow the search for information about what happened next, as the 1930s space program appears to have dissolved immediately after, with no reason given (but presumably as a part of Stalin's purges). It is implied that Kharlamov returned to Earth, but with no fanfare and apparently no assistance from the space program. A number of men are shown as suspected of being Kharlamov‚Äîthe NKVD seems to be conducting a criminal investigation of the program and it is implied that those involved, including Kharlamov himself, are in hiding. It seems that the capsule returned to Earth and landed in Chile, and that Kharlamov journeyed to the Russian Far East by way of Polynesia and China, yet feared capture on his return. His wife apparently covered for him when interrogated as to his whereabouts. Kharlamov is later found on the Mongolian steppes following the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, having suffered a severe traumatic brain injury. After undergoing psychiatric treatment in a sanitorium in Chita, he disappears. His wife later remarries. The very end of the movie shows the only footage of the mission itself after launch, explaining it as a film which was found at the landing site in Chile and is currently in the possession of the Antofagasta Natural museum. First there is a brief clip showing Kharlamov piloting the vehicle, presumably on final approach to the Moon. Following that is an equally brief panorama of a lunar landscape with the capsule or lander (it's unclear whether this was a direct ascent Moon landing) resting on the surface, apparently taken by Kharlamov during lunar EVA. Both scenes are shown as stills on the movie's cover. Then there is a short clip of the other cosmonauts walking through a hangar with the 1930s space program director, and the credits roll. Production The screenplay was written by Aleksandr Gonorovskiy and Ramil Yamaleyev, and is loosely based on conspiracy theories of lost cosmonauts. Production of First on the Moon lasted for three years and involved more than a thousand people. Most of filming was performed on Sverdlovsk Film Studio. The cosmonaut space training was filmed in Chelyabinsk, at the Institute of Aviation, where there exists equipment from Star City which even Gagarin used for training. The actors worked without stunt doubles; they were really spinning in the centrifuge, despite the fact that this training is difficult even for professionals. The film was made in both black and white and color, with cinematography by Anatoliy Lesnikov. The set was designed by Nikolay Pavlov. Cast *Boris Vlasov as Cap.

Geography The Minoan settlement was built on a hill, 135 meters above sea level. It is 800 meters from the sea. There are three permanent fresh water springs in the area, one only 150 meters east of the site and also at 135 meters above sea level. The site is reached via a 40-minute climb over loose stones. Tripiti is 200 meters north of Kalokambos, where an Early Minoan tholos tomb has been excavated. Archaeology Tripiti was first excavated 1986-1988 by Antonis Vasilakis. Minoa has long been famous for its settlements not having walls, inspiring theories of a long-standing peace, but walls are found at Tripiti. Two openings give access to the settlement at the northwest and southeast corners. Thirty-six Early Minoan II to Middle Minoan IA rooms have been uncovered at the site. Stone benches were built against the walls in some rooms. Artifacts discovered include a bronze chisel, axes, weights, mallets, hammers, milling stones and stone blades. Produce found in significant quantities included wheat, barley, vetch and peas. Bones found in the houses of the settlement indicate the presence of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, hares and poultry.

The text, \\"Verbe √©gal au Tr√®s-Haut\\" (\\"Word, one with the Highest\\"), is a French paraphrase by Jean Racine of a Latin hymn from the breviary for matins, Consors paterni luminis. The nineteen-year-old composer set the text in 1864‚Äì65 for a composition competition at the √âcole Niedermeyer de Paris, and it won him the first prize. The work was first performed the following year on 4 August 1866 in a version with accompaniment of strings and organ. The style shows similarities with his later work, Requiem. Today, the two works are often performed together.  History  Faur√© entered the school of church music √âcole Niedermeyer in Paris in 1854, when he was nine years old. There he received training in piano, theory, composition, and classical languages. Weekly choir singing was part of the curriculum for all students. Faur√©'s teacher in advanced piano was Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, who encouraged him to compose. In 1861 Faur√© participated in the first composition competition at the school. In 1863 he submitted a setting of Psalm 137, Super flumina Babylonis, for five vocal parts and orchestra. He received an award but no prize because he had not strictly adhered to all conditions. At age 19, in 1864‚Äì65, he composed Cantique de Jean Racine, scored for four vocal parts and piano or organ and that time he received the first prize in the 1865 contest. Faur√©'s Cantique was first performed on 4 August 1866 in a version with strings and organ, the organ played by the composer, when the new organ of the Saint-Sauveur Montivilliers Abbey was dedicated. C√©sar Franck, the dedicatee of the composition, conducted it, possibly the same version, in an orchestral concert on 15 May 1875. A version for a larger orchestra, with wind instruments but without organ, was possibly written by Faur√© himself and first played on 28 January 1906, according to a program of the Soci√©t√© de concerts du Conservatoire. Neither of these orchestral versions were published. Cantique was first published around 1875 or 1876, by Schoen in Paris, as part of the series Echo des Ma√Ætrises. In recent times, the accompaniment has been arranged for strings and harp by John Rutter, to great acclaim.  Text and music  thumb|upright=1.5|Racine's paraphrase of the Latin hymn Consors paterni luminis, English version: Word of God, one with the Most High, in Whom alone we have our hope, Eternal Day of heaven and earth, We break the silence of the peaceful night; Saviour Divine, cast your eyes upon us! Pour on us the fire of your powerful grace, That all hell may flee at the sound of your voice; Banish the slumber of a weary soul, That brings forgetfulness of your laws! O Christ, look with favour upon your faithful people Now gathered here to praise you; Receive their hymns offered to your immortal glory; May they go forth filled with your gifts. The French text, \\"Verbe √©gal au Tr√®s-Haut\\" (Word, one with the Highest), was written by Jean Racine and published in 1688 in Hymnes traduites du Br√©viaire romain. It is a paraphrase of a pseudo-ambrosian hymn for Tuesday matins from the breviary, Consors paterni luminis.Breviarum romanum ex decreto sacrosancti Concilii tridentini restitutum Summorum Pontificorum cura recognitum, 1961 Faur√© named his composition after Racine, not after the Latin original, possibly because he preferred the \\"elegant and rather florid\\" French text. The music is in D-flat major, in common time, marked Andante. The instrumental introduction contains three elements: a calm melody imitated by the voices, a similarly calm bass, and a flowing inner part in ceaseless triplets. The voices enter one after the other, beginning with the lowest, each presenting half a line of text, while the lower voices accompany in homophony. The second stanza is separated from the first by a short interlude similar to the introduction, while the third and final stanza follows immediately in the way of a reprise. The writing for the voices has been described as at the same time transparent and well balanced\\" (\\"zugleich durchl√§ssig wie klanglich ausgewogen\\"). Models such as Mendelssohn and Gounod show, but also a personal style. Zachary Gates notes in a paper dedicated to the work: \\"The long sweeping melodies and strong melodic and harmonic appoggiaturas in Cantique are a testament to the Romantic side of the piece, but there is a definite contemporary tint to what he's writing, hidden in very minute and well- justified atonal note choices in the harmonic structure and melody. After ten years of training at the school focused on liturgy, Faur√© was able to set \\"the inspiring text with a gorgeously restrained and respectful charm\\". Cantique de Jean Racine already showed traits of his later Requiem, which Faur√© composed in 1887, such as \\"dignity and refined simplicity\\" (W√ºrde und die vollendete Einfachheit). Both works have often been performed together in concerts and recordings.  Recordings  Cantique de Jean Racine has been recorded often, frequently with his Requiem. Paavo J√§rvi conducted in 2011 both works, combined with the first recording of Super flumina Babylonis, leading the Orchestre de Paris and its choir. A recording of both pieces in their original scoring was released in 2014 with the Choir of King's College, Cambridge and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, conducted by Stephen Cleobury.

Its membership consisted mostly of young people disillusioned with the grand coalition (Gro√üe Koalition) of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Since the coalition controlled 95 percent of the Bundestag, the APO provided a more effective outlet for student dissent. Its most prominent member and unofficial spokesman was Rudi Dutschke.  Classification  As opposed to APO, there was also opposition from other parties that, although they are represented in parliament, do not participate in the formation of the government. Small parties receive too few votes in an election to reenter the parliament. For example, in the past the Free Democratic Party (FDP) has often not been represented in L√§nderparlamente (federal state governments), but they are not classified as APO.  APO in Germany  APO in Germany called primarily for the constitutional freedom of opinion, the press and assembly to convey its demands publicly. New political currents usually begin outside the parliament and usually creep over the L√§nderparlamente into the German Bundestag (federal parliament) or even into the Bundesregierung Deutschlands (the German federal government). For example, the Green Party entered into a coalition with the SPD (the social democratic party in Germany) in 1998, it remained in government until 2005.  APO in the 1960s  The student movement began to gain strength and momentum in the middle of the 1960s in West Germany. The student movement is often used synonymously with APO, since it was at the time the most prominent form of extraparliamentary opposition in Germany. The student movement reached its peak in 1967 and 1968, especially in towns with universities. The most cited form of student-led APO was headed by the Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (the socialist German student group). The APO was formed through the opposition mounting against the \\"grand coalition\\" government in power since 1966, which united the CDU and the SPD under the Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger (CDU) and its proposed German Emergency Acts (emergency laws), which would maximise governmental control in case of a public dispute, allowing them to restrict civil rights such as privacy and freedom of movement. With 49 seats in parliament, the FDP was the only opposing party in the parliament at the ime; the rest were in extraparliamentary opposition. This weakened the opposition, the Bundestag strengthened the APO in Germany. The APO demanded a democratization of university politics. A motto of the student movement protesting against the old-fashioned nature of higher education institutions was \\"Unter den Talaren ‚Äì Muff von 1000 Jahren\\" (\\"under the university gowns, the musty smell of a thousand years\\"), which also referred to Hitler, who had called his regime a rule for a thousand years. The APO criticised society's repression of the crimes of National Socialism through its parents' generation, only interested in economic recovery. Thus, it joined worldwide protests against the Vietnam War and showed solidarity with the guerrilla fighters campaigning in North Vietnam against the actions of the USA. Among other protagonists, the movement idolised Cuban guerilla fighter Che Guevara and the founder of the Vietnamese Communist Party Ho Chi Minh. \\"Ho-Ho-Ho-Chi-Minh\\" was often chanted at demonstrations towards the end of the 1960s. Soon student movement took part in discussions about society and criticised society, demanding fundamental changes in society towards a socialist revolutionary ideal. New forms of communal life were tried, as well as new forms of protests and political actions. In particular, life in the Kommune I (Commune 1) had begun, spurred on by the words of Fritz Teufel, Dieter Kunzelmann and Rainer Langhans. Its members were often prosecuted, which caused a platform for further protests. The APO also found support and theoretical guidance from intellectuals and philosophers such as Ernst Bloch, Theodor W. Adorno, Herbert Marcuse and Jean- Paul Sartre. On the whole, the West German APO consisted of young people, mostly students, who could hardly gain a foothold in workforce. A few analysts of the time, such as Jutta Ditfurth, spoke out against these assumptions and embraced the workforce, including them in the political movement. In France, the case was somewhat different. Their solidarity was found between the unions and the student activists, which led to a near-revolutionary situation and much disruption, street fighting and mass strikes in May 1968, culminating in a state crisis. One of the protagonists of the German and French APO, activist and later Green Party politician Daniel Cohn-Bendit was refused reentry into France on the initiative of president Charles de Gaulle. Further members of the APO were Joseph \\"Joschka\\" Fischer (German foreign minister from 1998‚Äì2005) and Matthias Beltz, who became a famous kabarettist in the 1980s and the 1990s.  Intensified conflict  A watershed in the history of the West German APO commenced on June 2, 1967 during demonstrations against the official visit of the Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi when student Benno Ohnesorg was shot by a policeman. Ohnesorg was attending his first-ever political demonstration, and his death left his pregnant girlfriend to fend for herself. The student movement radicalised itself, became more militant and focused its attention on the Springer Press, namely the Bild Zeitung (the German equivalent of the British publication The Sun), which greatly opposed the student movement to the general public. Less than a year after the death of Benno Ohnesorg, a young worker named Josef Bachmann attempted to assassinate Rudi Dutschke, one of the most prominent leaders of the student movement; Bachmann shot Dutschke three times at close range, hitting him once in the head.Barclay, David E. (2012). \\"Benno Ohnesorg, Rudi Dutschke, and the Student Movement in West Berlin: Critical Reflections after Forty Years.\\" In Philip Broadbent and Sabine Hake (Eds.), Berlin Divided City, 1945‚Äì1989 (pp. 125‚Äì134). New York: Berghahn Books. p. 125. Dutschke suffered health problems from the shooting for the rest of his life, including an epileptic condition that caused his death by an accidental drowning in 1979.\\"Interview: Remembering student-movement firebrand Rudi Dutschke\\" [Louisa Schaefer interview with Gretchen Dutschke-Klotz, Dutschke's widow] (December 24, 2009). Deutsche Welle. Retrieved 2015-12-12. After 1969, the APO, in its then-current form, played no further role in West Germany, although there was further extraparliamentary opposition. New social movements in the 1970s affected political and social areas, which had already been addressed in part by the student movement. Environmental protection and nuclear power became the latest themes focused on by former APO activists.  From the end of the APO to the founding of the Green Party  The APO disbanded itself in 1968, dividing into smaller communist groups known as K-Gruppen, which remained on the political landscape but had no notable influence on West German politics. The \\"Marsch durch die Institutionen\\" (march through the institutions) propagated by Rudi Dutschke was embarked upon, resulting in the formation of the Green Party 11 years later. The idea behind this march was that political structures could be manipulated only from within, so it made more sense for larger groups to disband and for individuals and smaller groups to work more or less independently in their local areas to change the political system of their federal republic. The Green Party was formed to organize and accommodate the anti-nuclear movement in Germany, the peace movement activists and other new social movements in the 1970s and 1980s, whose founders had previously been very active in the APO. In 1983, the German Green Party was elected into the Bundestag, where it stood for the concept of movement and change, so that its roots and philosophy were seen in new social movements. Within only a few years, the Greens gained much political power and prestige. In the time following the party's founding, there was a divide between the fundamentalists and the realists, which still exists. It was the willingness of the Greens to compromise and adapt that has led to their increased political power. In particular, since they entered into a coalition government with the SPD in 1998 and supported issues targeted by the APO which were in the eyes of many underrepresented such as participation in the Kosovo War in 1999 and the Afghan War in 2002.  Radicalised groups  A small number of APO activists such as Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, journalist Ulrike Meinhof resorted to arson in department stores and illegal underground work. They collaborated in the \\"Rote Armee Fraktion\\" (RAF) that was commonly known as the \\"bewaffneten Widerstand\\" (armed opposition). Bank robberies, kidnappings and even murders were committed against protagonists of businesses, politics and justice by the RAF, the \\"Bewegung 2. Juni\\" (Movement of the 2nd June) and the \\"Revolution√§ren Zellen\\" (Revolutionary Cells) until the 1980s.

The range got its name from the Jizera River, which rises at the southern base of the Smrk massif. Geography The range stretches from the Lusatian Mountains (Zittau Mountains) in the northwest to the Krkono≈°e in the southeast. The Jizera Mountains comprise the sources of the Jizera river, as well as of the Kwisa and the Lusatian Neisse. The major part in the south is formed from granite, in the northern part from gneisses and mica schists, with some areas formed from basalt. The weather conditions are characterized by above-average annual precipitation. On 30 July 1897, the measuring station at Nov√° Louka recorded a daily precipitation amounting to 345.1 mm (13.6 inches), still an unbroken European record.

Later on, Celts, German tribes resides in the valleys until they left in 5th century. Later came Lusatian Sorbs. In the 14th century, German-speaking colonists came and started clearing of the dense primeval forests. Permanent settlements were established. In the 16th century, several glass works were founded. Glassmaking had a profound effect on the ecosystem. The primeval forest was gradually replaced by fast-growing spruce monoculture. Other important industries included tin-mining, metallurgy and textile. The Tabulov√Ω k√°men (), 1072 m) on the northern edge of the Smrk Mountain marked the border between the properties of the Counts of in Friedland, Bohemia, the von Gersdorff family from Meffersdorf, Upper Lusatia (Uniƒôcice, now part of Wigandsthal) and the Counts of Schaffgotsch from Schreiberhau, Silesia. In the second half of the 20th century the character of the Jizera Mountains changed completely. The German population of the area was expelled in 1945 and replaced by Poles on the now Polish and Czechs on the Czechoslovakian side of the mountains. The ecosystem was badly hit by emissions, produced by lignite fired power stations located in the Zittau basin, part of Europe's ecological Black Triangle. Weakened spruce forest, less resistant against various types of parasites, were on the verge of extinction. The higher parts of the mountains, once densely wooded, became largely treeless, in part also because of excessive deforestation. New roads cut through the once-secluded landscape. The situation improved only after the fall of communism in 1989. Open-pit coal mines in the former East Germany were closed, as well as several major power plants. Emission filters were installed at the immense Tur√≥w Power Station in Bogatynia on the Polish side of Lusatian Neisse. At the same time large-scale reforestation projects were started.

Business benefits of ADU On average, developers are spending only 5% of their time writing new code, 20% modifying the legacy code and up to 60% understanding the existing code. Thus, ADU saves a great deal of time and expense for organizations that are involved in the change control and impact analysis of complex computer systems. Impact analysis allows managers to know that if specific structures are changed or removed altogether, what the impact of those changes might be to enterprise-wide systems. This process has been largely used in the preparation of Y2K changes and validations in software. Application Discovery and Understanding is part of the process enabling development teams to learn and improve themselves by providing information on the context and current state of the application. The process of gaining application understanding is greatly accelerated when the extracted metadata is displayed using interactive diagrams. When a developer can browse the metadata, and drill down into relevant details on demand, then application understanding is achieved in a way that is natural to the developer. Significant reductions in the effort and time required to perform full impact analysis have been reported when ADU tools are implemented. ADU tools are especially beneficial to newly hired developers. A newly hired developer will be productive much sooner and will require less assistance from the existing staff when ADU tools are in place.

The gash through the dam corresponds to the alignment of a fault. The Baldwin Hills Dam disaster occurred on December 14, 1963, in the Baldwin Hills neighborhood of South Los Angeles, when the dam containing the Baldwin Hills Reservoir suffered a catastrophic failure and flooded the residential neighborhoods surrounding it. It began with signs of lining failure, followed by increasingly serious leakage through the dam at its east abutment. After three hours, the dam breached, with a total release of , resulting in five deaths and the destruction of 277 homes. Vigorous rescue efforts averted a greater loss of life. The reservoir was constructed on a low hilltop between 1947 and 1951 by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, directly on an active fault line, which was subsidiary to the well-known nearby Newport‚ÄìInglewood Fault. The underlying geologic strata were considered unstable for a reservoir, and the design called for a compacted soil lining meant to prevent seepage into the foundation. The fault lines were considered during planning, but were deemed by some, although not all, of the engineers and geologists involved as not significant.Scott 1987 The former reservoir is now part of the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area. Significance and diagnoses of the failure The failure of the Baldwin Hills Reservoir received an exceptional amount of attention from the civil engineering community and remains the subject of continuing interest. The reservoir had been conceived, designed, and built during and after World War II, a time when the pace of dam building was accelerating even as some disastrous dam failures were occurring, indicating a need for safer technologies. The builder of the Baldwin Hills dam, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, was aware of the difficult geologic conditions presented by the site and knew from past experiences, notably the catastrophic failure of the St. Francis Dam in 1928 in which over 400 people lost their lives, the serious consequences of a failure, even of a small reservoir in an urban setting. While dams were recognized as potentially dangerous, like nuclear technologies, they were also considered by Americans as a showcase technology‚Äîa means of fending off danger and spreading progressive American technologies and associated social benefits at home and abroad.Meehan, RL 2011 The Baldwin Hills dam designer, engineer Ralph Proctor, had also worked as an assistant civil engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power on the failed St. Francis Dam,Coroner's Inquest 1928 and had subsequently devised new methods of producing compacted earth fill in building its replacement.Rogers 2011 Proctor aggressively proceeded with the Baldwin Hills project even in the face of safety concerns and disagreements over important design details raised within his own department. Late in 1963, when the Baldwin Hills failure occurred, coincidentally also happened to be the time of another notable public disaster. Only two months before, at the Vajont Dam in Italy, a massive landslide into the reservoir created a seiche, which overtopped the dam, thereby flooding the valley below and causing the deaths of about 2000 people. The Baldwin Hills Reservoir had been built, as were others, to assure an ample supply of safe water for the people of Los Angeles in case of a catastrophe such as an earthquake, fire, or war, and its failure was a blow to engineering confidence and the subject of many writings and two professional conferences (1972 and 1987, see references). The failure occurred shortly after the death of the authoritative Harvard engineer Karl Terzaghi, whose ideas had long dominated both earth dam engineering and the engineering science of soil mechanics; Terzaghi had also made significant contributions to understanding subsidence in oilfields. This left the assessment of the Baldwin Hills failure in the hands of a new generation of engineers, some of whom took on conflicting roles as experts in various lawsuits. The design and construction of the dam had been inspected and approved by the California Department of Water Resources. A meticulously documented study published by that agency in 1964‚Äîwhile pointing out various connections between oilfield operations in the Inglewood Oil Field and ground disturbances in the area, including beneath the reservoir and at some distance from the reservoir‚Äîconcluded rather vaguely that the failure was due to \\"an unfortunate combination of physical factors\\".California 1964 The monetary damages resulting from the failure were large, and some of the investigations that followed the state study were sponsored by litigants seeking more specific conclusions relevant to legal liability. This drew attention to oilfield operations in the area. From the outset, the ground faulting and fault creep which destroyed the reservoir were probably related to the many feet of ground subsidence that had occurred a half mile west of the reservoir over decades of oil extraction in the Inglewood field. The oilfield-related subsidence in the Inglewood field, though generally denied by the oil companies as a legal policy, was documented exhaustively by the US Geological Survey in 1969.Castle 1969 Subsidence following oil extraction from shallow deposits in unconsolidated sediments had been understood by oil industry experts since the 1920s.Geertsma 1973 Following the discovery in 1970 by geologist Douglas Hamilton of faulting and surface seepage of oilfield waste brines along the fault, which traversed and extended south of the reservoir, Hamilton and Meehan concluded that oilfield injection for waste disposal and improved recovery of oil, a new technology at the time, was a significant cause of the failure, triggering hydraulic fracturing and aggravating movements on a fault traversing the reservoir even on the day of the failure.Hamilton 1971 Subsequently, the US Geological Survey concluded in 1976 that displacements at the ground surface causing reservoir failure and ground cracking in the Stocker-LaBrea area southeast of the reservoir were 90% or more attributable to exploitation of the Inglewood oil field, and that this faulting was likely aggravated by water flooding with pressures exceeding hydraulic fracturing levels.Castle and Yerkes 1976 By 1972, nearly a decade after the failure, the immediate legal issues had been settled out of court and the matter was reopened as a topic of discussion among investigators in a published engineering conference at Purdue University. Engineer Thomas Leps, who had served as consultant on the 1964 state investigation, took on a role as neutral reviewer in this and most subsequent American studies of the failure. Leps concluded that about 7 inches of offset had occurred on the fault beneath the reservoir during its life, about 2 inches of which had occurred in the months just before the failure. Leps associated the latter with repressurization of the oilfield. This, along with stretching of the ground due to subsidence of about 12 feet from oil extraction, had caused the lining failure that doomed the reservoir.Leps 1972 p. 541 Some prominent consultants, including those on a team led by Arthur Casagrande, Harvard successor to Karl Terzaghi, held that oilfield operations were not a significant influence at all, but that the failure was the result of defective siting and design with the heavy weight of the dam and reservoir being the significant cause of the fatal foundation movement.Casagrande 1972 This view exonerated the oil companies, namely Standard Oil, which had sponsored the study. Casagrande refused to acknowledge any ground movements in the area as being related to oilfield operations and argued that ground movements that affected the dam were found only beneath the reservoir, not in adjoining areas. Most of these questions were examined once again in 1986 following investigations of a suspiciously similar major failure of the Bureau of Reclamation's Teton Dam in June 1976, and a near failure of the Department of Water and Power's Lower Van Norman Dam in the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. Professor Ronald Scott of Caltech, who had participated in the Casagrande studies, noted at a follow-up 1987 conference on Baldwin Hills that Casagrande had ignored or been unaware of ground movements clearly unrelated to the reservoir (e.g. those at Stocker-LaBrea) in his analysis. Another engineer, Stanley Wilson‚Äîwho had also worked with Casagrande on the 1972 studies and supported the claim that oilfield subsidence was an insignificant cause‚Äînow conceded that analogous ground offsets extended well outside the reservoir area, notably in the Stocker-LaBrea area, so that the reservoir and other fault movements could not be attributed to the reservoir itself‚Äîthus tacitly attributing responsibility for the failure to oilfield operations. Hence, the opinions on the role of oilfield subsidence and repressurization appeared to converge. Fluid withdrawal (pink)-injection (purple) model of fault movement and Baldwin Hills Dam failure: Injection pressures exceeded hydrofracture pressures and the recorded timing of the fault offset support the injection as being the decisive factor.Meehan 2012 The issue of oilfield causation was a central theme in most of these discussions, with little attention having been directed to the details of the failure. The absolute necessity of a lining for this site was generally taken for granted in these proceedings even as it had been by Proctor himself, regardless of the fact that almost all earth dams perform satisfactorily without linings. Some suggestions as to possible preventive design and construction techniques that might have made the dam safer were raised to engineering consensus and reached a state of textbook knowledge in the late 1980s.James Ed Al 1988 For example, the character of the compacted earth lining (which had been regularly referred to as clay, but must have been substantially silt and sand, having been derived from the local Inglewood formation) was raised, if obliquely, in the suggestion made in the end that improved performance might have come from the use of a different lining material.James et al 1988 In 2001, a new angle on failure analysis was introduced by Mahunthan and Schofield, who concluded that overcompaction of the dam fill and lining was a significant aggravating factor in both the Baldwin Hills and Teton failures.Muhunthan and Schofield 2001 This assertion was based on Schofield's concepts of critical-state soil mechanics,Schofield 2006 a corollary of which was that heavily compacted but lightly confined soils could be dangerously unstable where seepage forces were present. This issue had not been raised in the previous American-dominated discussions and remains in some degree contrary to American ideas in both theoretical soil mechanics and practical geotechnical engineering. In fact, the 1964 DWR failure study implied that heavy compaction was a favored technique for earth dam construction,California 1964 p. 11 and Table V-2 and this assumption appeared not to have been reexamined over the 25 years of post-failure investigation and discussion. The failure of the reservoir has been a subject of ongoing interest in the field of dam-breach studies. A recent study examined the dam failure as a two-stage process and succeeded in modeling the flood in the urban area downstream.Gallegos et al 2009 Although the Baldwin Hills Reservoir site has now been dedicated as a community park, and no further significant hazard is associated with ground movements there, the associated faults to the southeast (Stocker-LaBrea and the Windsor School area) continue to move significantly as of 2012, causing damage to private and public facilities. The current oilfield operator, Plains Exploration and Production Company (PXP), which has intensified production and development efforts in the oilfield with the rising price of petroleum, does not, unlike its predecessor Standard Oil, acknowledge any causal connection between fault movements and oilfield activities, and has retained a team of consultants who support this position or conclude that the causes of the movements are unknown.StrataGen Engineering 2012 The role of shallow hydraulic fracturing, which has recently been introduced as a means of stimulating production at depths around in the southeast part of the Inglewood field,Moodie 2004 and at greater depths elsewhere in the field, has also generated public concern and controversy. However, oil operators, while admitting that fracture pressuresHubbert 1957Castle 1976 are being exceeded, refuse to acknowledge a relationship between injection at fracturing pressure levels and fault movement. The PXP and PXP consultant conclusions, that adverse effects are either unknown or not present, are disputed by other reviewers. Recent discharges of oilfield gases in the Baldwin Hills may also be related to raised pressures resulting from injection, and may be of similar origin as the gas problems in the nearby Salt Lake field.Hamilton 1992 Coverage KTLA used a helicopter to cover the disaster. Common today, this was perhaps the first such live aerial coverage of a breaking news event. Richard N. Levine, a 17-year-old photography student, rushed to a higher viewpoint and made 35-mm pictures of the evolving dam break.

Originally published 1998 by the Free Press, which published a revised edition in 2009. The book was a 1999 Pulitzer Prize finalist (general non-fiction). Summary Harris challenges the idea that the personality of adults is determined chiefly by the way they were raised by their parents. She looks at studies which claim to show the influence of the parental environment and claims that most fail to control for genetic influences. For example, if aggressive parents are more likely to have aggressive children, this is not necessarily evidence of parental example. It may also be that aggressiveness has been passed down through the genes. Indeed, many adopted children show little correlation with the personality of their adoptive parents, and significant correlation with the natural parents who had no part in their upbringing. The role of genetics in personality has long been accepted in psychological research. However, even identical twins, who share the same genes, are not exactly alike, so inheritance is not the only determinant of personality. Psychologists have tended to assume that the non-genetic factor is the parental environment, the \\"nurture\\". However, Harris argues that it is a mistake to use \\"'nurture' ... [as] a synonym for 'environment.'\\"The Nurture Assumption, Chapter 1 Many twin studies have failed to find a strong connection between the home environment and personality. Identical twins differ to much the same extent whether they are raised together or apart. Adoptive siblings are as unalike in personality as non- related children. Harris also argues against the effects of birth order. She states: > Birth order effects are like those things that you think you see out of the > corner of your eye but that disappear when you look at them closely. They do > keep turning up but only because people keep looking for them and keep > analyzing and reanalyzing their data until they find them. Harris' most innovative idea was to look outside the family and to point at the peer group as an important shaper of the child's psyche. For example, children of immigrants learn the language of their home country with ease and speak with the accent of their peers rather than their parents. Children identify with their classmates and playmates rather than their parents, modify their behavior to fit with the peer group, and this ultimately helps to form the character of the individual. Reception The Nurture Assumption received mixed responses. The neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky says her book is \\"based on solid science\\". The psychologist Steven Pinker of Harvard predicts that the book \\"will come to be seen as a turning point in the history of psychology\\". However, the psychologist Frank Farley claims that \\"she's taking an extreme position based on a limited set of data. Her thesis is absurd on its face, but consider what might happen if parents believe this stuff!\\" Wendy Williams, who studies how environment affects IQ, argues that \\"there are many, many good studies that show parents can affect how children turn out in both cognitive abilities and behavior\\". The psychologist Jerome Kagan argues that Harris \\"ignores some important facts, ones that are inconsistent with this book's conclusions\\". Harris rejects the idea that The Nurture Assumption will encourage parents to neglect or mistreat their children. She maintains that parents will continue to treat their children well \\"for the same reason you are nice to your friends and your partner, even though you have no hopes of molding their character. For the same reason your great-grandparents were nice to their children, even though they didn't believe in the nurture assumption\\".

The ceilings were painted by the Brussels artist Van Hoeck and his large workshop. Several kings and heads of state sojourned in the Kurhaus during its heyday. Until the mid 1960s, the Kurhaus remained a public attraction as a major concert hall, at which many top artists performed. The Rolling Stones performed at the Kurhaus on August 8, 1964, and had to flee the building due to the vast numbers of excited fans outside.http://www.publiekeomroep.nl/artikelen/rolling-stones-in-het- kurhaushttp://kranten.kb.nl/view/paper/id/ddd%3A010678651%3Ampeg21%3Ap003%3Aa0001 Ike & Tina Turner performed at the Kurhaus on February 11, 1971. The show was aired on Dutch television VPRO and released on DVD in 2004 as The Legends Ike & Tina Turner Live in '71. The Kurhaus was saved from demolition in 1975 by being listed as a historic building, and was completely renovated. It was reopened in 1979 by Princess Beatrix.

Heil started skiing at age two. Jennifer Heil won the first gold medal for Canada in the 2006 Winter Olympics games in Turin, Italy and a silver medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, which was also Canada's first medal in those games. Heil is the reigning world champion in dual moguls. She has three world championship titles in total and two silver medals from the Worlds as well. Over her career, Heil has won a record-tying five overall FIS World Cup Crystal Globe titles for freestyle skiing. Heil is involved with several charitable organisations including Because I am a Girl and Right to Play. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Heil donated $25,000 to Because I am a Girl. Heil also speaks to students across Canada along a theme of Dare to Dream, and hosts an annual \\"girls only\\" mogul skiing camp. B2ten, created with the help of Heil, is a privately run business model organisation with the intent of raising funds to support amateur Canadian athletes. Career =Early career= Heil competed in her first Olympics at the 2002 Winter Olympics at the age of 18, finishing fourth in the moguls, just one- hundredth of a point out of a bronze medal. She took the 2002‚Äì03 season off due to injury, and then won the World Cup in 2003‚Äì04, 2004‚Äì05 and 2005‚Äì06. Heil then won the first gold medal for Canada in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Giving Canada its first victory on the first full day of competition, Heil placed her title in the moguls event. Following the Olympics, Heil completed the season by winning her fourth straight World Cup title. =B2ten= Jennifer Heil took part in extensive experimental training in order to prepare for the Olympic Games. She worked with one of Canada's leading sports psychologists, a strength trainer, and an athletic therapist daily. After winning in 2006, Jennifer expressed her desire to build a program that would offer the same kind of support she got to other athletes in Canada. JD Miller and her coach Dominick Gauthier helped her build B2ten who now raised about 3 million dollars and supports 20 athletes from 13 different sports. Heil took the 2008 season off in order to help heal her injured knees. Following that year, Heil had a very successful 2008‚Äì09 world cup season. This included a silver medal during the stop at Cypress Mountain which was the site of the moguls competition for the 2010 Winter Olympics. =2010 Vancouver Olympics= Going into the 2010 Olympics, Heil won the last 4 2009‚Äì10 Freestyle Skiing World Cup events that she entered. She opted out of the last event before the games to give her fellow countrymen an opportunity to qualify for the games. The women's moguls qualifications began in unfavourable weather conditions with rain, sleet, and slushy conditions on the course. Heil finished the qualification in second place, meaning she ran second-to-last in the final. In the final Heil had a successful and fast run which put her in first place with one skier yet to go. Heil sat, watched, and waited as Hannah Kearney of the US had her final run. Kearney finished first and displaced Heil for both the gold and as Olympic champion. Heil standing on the podium with the other women's moguls medalists Heil was visibly distraught as many including herself expected her to win the gold medal. Heil had gone into the event as the reigning Olympic champion and favourite not only to win the gold, but Canada's first gold medal during a Canadian hosted Olympics ever. Heil's B2ten company was founded in part to win the first gold at home and assist fellow Canadians in their quest for medals. The honour of winning the first home-soil Olympic gold medal would go to Alexandre Bilodeau the next day on Sunday, February 14. Although Heil herself did not win it, Bilodeau's victory deserves some credit from Heil as he is a sponsored B2ten athlete as well. The next day Heil was seen on television celebrating her silver medal. She went on to say that she did not lose the gold but won the silver medal and was celebrating on stage at the medal ceremony. According to CTV an average of about 6.6 million and a peak of 8 million Canadians tuned into their television to watch Heil try and break the gold medal slump. More Canadians watched Heil try to win gold than the 6 million that had watched the New Orleans Saints win Super Bowl XLIV. Following her 2010 Olympics silver medal win at the Cypress Mountain venue near Vancouver, Heil went on to say that this would likely be her last games. Heil said that she wants to win a third world championship next year in 2011, following that she would like to get on with her post-mogul career. Heil said she hoped to finish her degree in management studies at McGill University after retiring following the 2010‚Äì11 season and planned to continue her work in jewellery design. She also stated that she plans to continue her work in philanthropy. Following the 2010 Olympics Heil again made a donation of $25,000, this time to Because I am a Girl, an organization that helps lift girls out of poverty. Heil said of her donation that \\"I‚Äôve had the power in my hands to help and many young girls don‚Äôt have that same power. We want to make this Canada‚Äôs most giving Games ever.\\" Alexandre Bilodeau also made a donation but he made his to the Canadian Association of Pediatric Health Centres for cerebral palsy. They both went on to encourage others to give saying that they have the ability to give back and if others were to help in their own way it would make a difference. =Finishing her career= During January of the 2010‚Äì11 World Cup season, Heil officially announced her retirement prior to the Canadian stop at the Canada Olympic Park in Calgary. Heil would say of her retirement that \\"I'm definitely in good shape. I could go for one more Olympic Games. I'm still at the top of my game, but for me I feel it's an important time to build on my future. I want to be as successful off the slopes as I have been on the slopes and I feel that time is now. I feel that in my heart.\\" Heil's next event was at the 2011 FIS World Championships. In her last event there in the moguls final, Heil won her first ever gold medal and first ever medal having previously won only in the dual moguls event. Heil said of her win there that \\"It's a title I've never won before and there's been a lot of discussion about that in Canada. I've never been one to count my medals and count my titles, but I'm pretty happy that that conversation is over.\\" For the last day of the World Championships, Heil competed in the dual moguls event. There she advanced to the final where she defeated young teammate Chlo√© Dufour-Lapointe to win her second gold medal of the competition. The victory was her third successive dual moguls crown, more importantly it ensured that Heil would end her career as a double world champion. As a result of her dual championship golds she was awarded the Canadian Press's female athlete of the year for 2011. Personal life Heil is a management and political science student at Desautels Faculty of Management of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Heil is involved in several charities including Right to Play, a sports-based humanitarian agency, and Plan Canada‚Äôs Because I am a Girl, a program that promotes girls' rights internationally. She has stated that she wishes to continue her efforts in these charities following her retirement. In her spare time, Heil is an avid surfer.Scaringi, Joe, \\"Shooting the breeze with four Olympic medalists\\" , 11 August 2010, accessed 13 August 2010.

It is an example of both a decarboxylation and a halogenation reaction as the product has one fewer carbon atoms than the starting material (lost as carbon dioxide) and a halogen atom is introduced its place. The reaction was first demonstrated by Alexander Borodin in his 1861 reports of the preparation of methyl bromide ( CH3Br ) from silver acetate ( CH3CO2Ag ). Shortly after, the approach was applied to the degradation of fatty acids in the laboratory of Adolf Lieben. However, it is named for Cl√§re Hunsdiecker and her husband Heinz Hunsdiecker, whose work in the 1930s developed it into a general method. Several reviews have been published, and a catalytic approach has been developed. :The Hunsdiecker reaction History Alexander Borodin first observed the reaction in 1861 when he prepared methyl bromide from silver acetate. The reaction is a decarboxylation in that alkyl halide product has one fewer carbon atoms than its parent carboxylate, lost as carbon dioxide. : \\\\+ -> \\\\+ \\\\+ Around the same time, Angelo Simonini was working as a student of Adolf Lieben at the University of Vienna, investigating the reactions of silver carboxylates with iodine. They found that the products formed are determined by the stoichiometry within the reaction mixture. Using a carboxylate-to-iodine ratio of 1:1 leads to an alkyl iodide product, in line with Borodin's findings and the modern understanding of the Hunsdiecker reaction. However, a 2:1 ratio favours the formation of an ester product that arises from decarboxylation of one carboxylate and coupling the resulting alkyl chain with the other. :The Simonini reaction Using a 3:2 ratio of reactants leads to the formation of a 1:1 mixture of both products. These processes are sometimes known as the Simonini reaction rather than as modifications of the Hunsdiecker reaction. :3 \\\\+ 2 -> \\\\+ \\\\+ 2 \\\\+ 3 It is now well established that mercuric oxide can also be used to effect this transformation. The reaction has been applied to the preparation of œâ-bromo esters with chain lengths between five and seventeen carbon atoms, with the preparation of methyl 5-bromovalerate published in Organic Syntheses as an exemplar. Reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism of the Hunsdiecker reaction is believed to involve organic radical intermediates. The silver salt of the carboxylic acid 1 will quickly react with bromine to form acyl hypohalite intermediate 2. Formation of the diradical pair 3 allows for radical decarboxylation to form the diradical pair 4, which will quickly recombine to form the desired organic halide 5. The trend in the yield of the resulting halide is primary > secondary > tertiary. :650px  Reaction with Œ±, Œ≤-Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids  Synthesis of Œ≤-arylvinyl halide by microwave-induced Hunsdiecker reaction. Chowdhury and Roy noted several drawbacks of using Hunsdiecker reaction, namely that some reagents, such as molecular bromine and salts of mercury, thallium, lead, and silver, are inherently toxic and that reactions with Œ±, Œ≤-unsaturated carboxylic acids result in low yield. Regarding reactions using Œ±, Œ≤-unsaturated carboxylic acids, Kuang et al. modified the reaction with using a new halogenating agent, N-halosuccinimide, and lithium acetate as the catalyst, which resulted in higher yield of Œ≤-Halostyrenes. They found that using the microwave irradiation could synthesize (E)-Œ≤-arylvinyl halide much quicker with higher yields. This is useful because synthesizing (E)-vinyl bromide in general is not very practical due to the complexity of alternative reagents (e.g. organometallic compounds), longer reaction times, and lower yields. Using microwave irradiation also allows the synthesized arylvinyl halide to carry electron-donating groups (in addition to electron-withdrawing groups), which is not possible with alternative synthetic methods. While tetrabutylammonium trifluoroacetate (TBATFA) could be used as an alternative catalyst for a metal-free reaction, it was noted that lithium acetate resulted in higher yields compared to other relatively complex catalysts, including tetrabutylammonium trifluoroacetate. An alternative method using micelles was found, with green characteristics. Micelles generally facilitate reactions thanks to their solublization capability and here, it was found that a reaction with Œ±, Œ≤-unsaturated aromatic carboxylic acids and N-halosuccinimide catalyzed by cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and Triton-X-100 in dichloroethane (DCE) carried out under reflux conditions of 20‚Äì60 minutes formed Œ≤-Halostyrenes in excellent yields with high regioselectivity. Variations =Mercuric oxide= Lampman and Aumiller used mercuric oxide and bromine to prepare 1-bromo-3-chlorocyclobutane from 3-chlorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid in a modification of the Hunsdiecker reaction.This is known as Cristol-Firth modification. The product had previously been shown by Wiberg to react with molten sodium metal to form bicyclobutane via a Wurtz coupling in good yield. =Kochi reaction= The Kochi reaction is a variation on the Hunsdiecker reaction developed by Jay Kochi that uses lead(IV) acetate and lithium chloride (lithium bromide can also be used) to effect the halogenation and decarboxylation. :250px See also *Barton Decarboxylation *Barton‚ÄìMcCombie deoxygenation References  External links  * Animation of the reaction mechanism Free radical reactions Halogenation reactions Name reactions ","title":"Hunsdiecker reaction"},{"id":"4039859","text":"The Volga River is an U.S. Geological Survey.

Also recorded by the name , the name may have been a term referring collectively to eight hags, not just one. Accounts in mythology The hag appears by the Yomotsu-shikome (or Ugly- Female-of-the-Underworld\\") name in the eldest Japanese chronicle Kojiki. But either eight demon-hags (female oni) or a woman/women named Yomotsu-hisame hunted after Izanagi according to the Nihon Shoki, which frequently gives different readings from alternate sources. Kojiki version Izanagi was fleeing the Underworld with Yomotsu-shikome in hot pursuit. Izanagi first cast down his black headdress,plant woven into a wreathe (), and used to ward off evil () which turned into a kind of grapes, which is Old Japanese for () and slowed the hag's advance as she devoured them. Next he broke off his comb Izanagi earlier broke off the end of this comb to ignite the fire in order to have a light source to peek at his wife and cast them, and the broken piece (the teeth?) turned into bamboo shoots, slowing her down again as she pulled them out and ate them. But the hag was now joined by a large army 1500 strong led by eight Thunder-deities. Izanagi brandished his but still they pursued, until he climbed atop the \\"flat slope\\" or \\"Even Pass\\" at the entrance to the Underworld, and flung three peaches, whereby the pursuers retreated. After this, Izanami herself came in pursuit, and Izanagi blocked the entrance at the slope with a boulder. Nihon Shoki version Apart from the variant name and the possibility of multiple hags (\\"eight Ugly Females of Yomi,\\") are some minor discrepancies, such as the lack of mention of the Thunder god and the army and the peaches. As Izanagi reached the entrance, Izanami was already there. According to one telling, Izanagi urinated at the large tree, so that the water swelled into a river, and before Yomotsu-hisame could cross it, Izanagi reached the entrance named the \\"Even Pass of Yomi\\". Critical literature Several commentators have pointed to the connection between the peach in this story and the general traditional belief or superstition that the peach has supernatural evil-warding powers. citing sinologist on several Chinese use of the peach, including the wood of the bow of the mythic Yi (Áæø).(zasshi code 66951-07; ky≈çtsu zasshi code T10-66951-07-1000) The symbolism of the \\"Peach Boy\\" or Momotar≈ç that defeated the oni is often used as a familiar illustrative parallel.

Margamkali performed during a Syro-Malabar Nasrani wedding at Arakuzha. Margamkali (Malayalam:‡¥Æ‡¥æ‡µº‡¥ó‡µç‡¥ó‡¥Ç‡¥ï‡¥≥‡¥ø ) is an ancient Indian round dance of the St. Thomas Christians community based in Kerala state, mainly practiced by the endogamous sub-sect known as the Knanaya or Southist Christians. The dance retells the life and missionary work of St. Thomas the Apostle, based on the third century apocryphal Acts of Thomas. History There are several opinions on the potential origin of Margamkali. They are: # It is traced back to Jewish wedding songs and dance from the diaspora.Neumann K (1998) \\"Mond, Gott Siva und heiliger Thomas: Die religi√∂se Gemeinschaft der Knanaya in Kerala\\" Universit√§t Marburg p 150 Scholars have found common origin among Malabar Jewish dance and songs and the dance form of Margamkali.Vellian, J (1990) 'Crown, veil, cross : marriage rites' in Syrian churches series, vol 15 p 30 In addition, scholars like P.M. Jussay and Dr Shalva Weil have found many similarities in the customs and rituals of Knanaya Christians and Malabar Jews.Weil, Shalva. \\"Symmetry between Christians and Jews in India: the Cnanite Christians and the Cochin Jews of Kerala,\\" Contributions to Indian Sociology, 1982. 16(2): 175-196.

Vishnu Namboothiri, Dictionary of folklore, page 529 \\"Margam\\" means path or way or solution in Malayalam, but in the religious context it is known as the path to attain salvation. The process of conversion to Christianity was known as \\"Margam Koodal\\" until recently in Kerala. Much of this folk art is woven around the mission of St. Thomas, the Apostle. The original Margam Kali describes the arrival of St. Thomas in Malabar, the miracles he performed, the friendship as well as the hostility of the people among whom he worked, the persecution he suffered, the churches and crosses he put up in various places, etc. These details are incorporated in the various stanzas of the Margam Kali songs. Kerala's Margam Kali is an important element in the age-old and hallowed tradition of St Thomas among the Syrian Christians of Malabar Coast. K.C. Zacharia - THE SYRIAN CHRISTIANS OF KERALA: DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC TRANSITION IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY The disparity between the present condition of this form and the early days leads one to assume three important phases in the history of Margamkali. The first phase was the pre-colonization one in which this semi-theatrical form was performed by the Saint Thomas Christians during special occasions. Parichamuttukali (The sword and shield dance) was also a part of it. Later Synod of Diamper curbed and suppressed this native form. During the seventeenth century, due to the efforts of a Knanaya priest Itti Thomman Kathanar, the textual part of this form got certain upliftment and care. The Margamkali might have been edited and refashioned into the present fourteen stanza structure during this period. However, until the end of the nineteenth century the art form was not in common practice even though it did exist in some places. But at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, the form became popular once again, and some structural changes took place then. Masters such as Kalarikal Unni ashan, Indumoottil Kocheppu ashan, Indumoottil Kutto ashan were some of them who were responsible for this change and upheaval. By this time the Knanaya scholar Puttanpurikkal Uthuppu Lukose compiled and published Margamkali Pattukal in 1910. In 1924 the European priest and scholar Fr. Hosten S.J. witnessed the Margam Kali danced by the Knanaya of Kottayam and was enamored by the ancient artform. Subsequently, Hosten endeavored to present the dance at the Mission Exhibitions at the Vatican in 1925 by bringing these dancers to Rome, however this venture was met with mass resentment and disapproval from the Northist St. Thomas Christians who viewed the artform as being an \\"uncouth performance\\" and stated that if performed it \\"might ridicule all the St. Thomas Christians\\". During the 1960s the St. Thomas Christian scholar of folk culture Dr. Chummar Choondal led a sociological survey of the Margam Kali and noted that the practice was solely of the Knanaya Community. Furthermore, Choondal found that all of the Margam teachers and groups of the time period were entirely Knanaya. The following analysis of the art-form was stated by Dr. Chummar Choondal. > ‚ÄúKnanaya Christians have the most ancient and varied art forms. Margamkali > is their dance form. Generally, it is said that margamkali is said in vogue > among the Syrian Christians, but a close and critical observation will show > that the practice and propagation of margamkali were among the Knanites. > During my research in the 1960s, I could not find this art form practiced in > the regions like Trissur and Pala where the Syrians are thickly populated. > The traditions of margamkali can thus by analyzed: 70% among Knanaya > Catholics and 25% among Knanya Jacobites.‚Äù In the late 1900s the art form was heavily in decline among the St. Thomas Christian Community but the Knanaya community took upon the initiative to promote and further expand the art form. In the 1970s and 1980s the Knanaya priests Fr. George Karukaparambil and Jacob Vellian as well as scholar of folk culture Dr. Chummar Choondal undertook years of heavy research and study with the help of 33 Knanaya ashans or teachers of Margam Kali to revitalize the ancient art form. Through critical historical, musicological, and ethnochoreological evaluation this team of researchers systematized Margam Kali and promoted it among schools and cultural organizations as an item of competition in youth festivals and eventually presented it to Kerala's Minister of Education who introduced a 14 minute long documentary created by the team. In order to make sure Margam Kali would be an art form set in stone, the team looked for a formal center for the furthering or Margam Kali and allied Christian art forms. Mar Kuriakose Kunnasserry the Bishop of the Knanaya Diocese of Kottayam came to the aide of the team in 1995 and established Hadusa (Syriac for Dancing/Rejoicing), as an All India Institute of Christian Performing Arts which in part has forever aided the existence and prominence of Margam Kali today. Hadusa has released a text titled \\"Margam kali Aattaprakaaram\\" which is considered as an authentic reference material for this art form. Performance Typically, a dozen dancers sing and dance clapping around a Nilavilakku wearing the traditional white dhoti (\\"mundu\\") and blouse (\\"chatta\\"). The lamp represents Christ and the performers his disciples. The performance is usually held in two parts (\\"padham\\") and begins with songs and dances narrating the life of Saint Thomas, the apostle. It then takes a striking turn with a martial play of artificial swords and shields. Margamkali does not use any instruments other than two small palm size cymbals played by the same person who sings the song. It was originally played by men and afterwards by boys, but nowadays women also perform the dance.The Hosten pictures of 1924 published by Prof. George Menachery may be referred to Today Currently both Margamkali and Parichamuttukali are included in the State Youth Festival of Kerala. This makes these art forms a competitive item in the Four-tier system (i.e. School, Sub District, Revenue and State level) Youth festival.The efforts of Prof. George Menachery was met with the approval of Minister T. M. Jacob in introducing this item in the State Youth Festival Margam Kali is performed mainly by women in cultural shows and by school children in a variety of competitions.

It was utilized to bring UCLA's star center, Lew Alcindor (a.k.a. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), away from the basketball. The offense was originally called the \\"Cha Cha\\". It is a patterned offense relying on cuts across the key (called a \\"flex cut\\") and down screens to create a \\"pick-the-picker\\" action. This offense is most effective against a man-to-man defense, though some ambitious coaches have used it against odd front zones. It is the favored offense of many high school programs because it requires players to be in constant motion and the patterns of screens and cuts are easy to remember. Though dismissed by many coaches at the college level for its predictability, some notable programs still rely on it. It has been run by many NCAA teams, including by Gary Williams of the University of Maryland. Williams used the flex offense to lead the Terrapins to the 2002 NCAA National Championship. Also, Gordie James of Willamette University used the flex offense to lead the Bearcats to the 1993 NAIA Division II National Championship. Additionally, Jerry Sloan ran his variation of it for years with the Utah Jazz. The flex is a type of continuity offense, similar to (and in fact derived from) the earlier shuffle offense. The basic theory behind the flex offense is that all players are interchangeable‚Äîno player has a traditional role. The point guard advances the ball up the court to start the offense, while other players set screens to create openings. Typically, the point guard sets the offense on the same side as a low-post player positioned at the right block. The point guard passes opposite to a high-post at the top of the key while a wing player cuts off a screen by the low post player towards the ball to receive a pass from the high post player. The point guard screens down to the low post player who moves to the top of the key to receive a pass from the high post player. The same cut occurs on the other side of the ball and the offense begins its continuous cycle.  Variations  Gonzaga University runs a modified version of the simplistic flex offense. The University of Maryland ran a modified version of the flex offense under previous head coach Gary Williams. Maryland's prior offense attempted to run a version of the flex offense that allowed for closer shots at the basket, and was less focused on obtaining open perimeter jump shots. Boston College under Coach Al Skinner also ran the flex; the BC version was very compact, creating an extremely physical game and limiting a team's ability to help because of how collapsed the floor is. Variations of the flex include the 5 man flex, utilizing all 5 players in the cutting and screening action and the 4 man flex, which utilizes 4 players. Since this offense is classified as a continuity offense, in which players repeat specific actions, some teams will build in options within the offense to keep defenses from anticipating a particular cut or screen.

It was originally called \\"Fifteenth Century\\", but was renamed \\"Caslon Antique\\" by Nadall's foundry, Barnhart Bros. & Spindler, in the mid-1920s. The design of the typeface is meant to evoke the Colonial era. Early printers would reuse metal type over and over again, and the faces would become chipped and damaged from use. Caslon Antique emulates this look. Variants An italic variant of the font is also available. In addition to versions available under the traditional name, Corel produces its own version of the font under the name \\"Casablanca Antique.\\" Notable uses Caslon Antique is popular today when a \\"old-fashioned\\" or \\"gothic\\" look is desired. It was used in the opening credits of the Jacques Rivette film La Belle Noiseuse. It is used by the musical group The Sisters of Mercy and Sepultura on their albums, for the logo of the musical Les Mis√©rables (but it seems to be more probably the Corel 'Casablanca Antique' font that has been used for this title), and for the covers of the books in A Series of Unfortunate Events. It is also frequently used on historical displays. It is used for the Warhammer Fantasy Role-Play role-playing game. The 1985 reboot of the TV series The Twilight Zone uses it.

His father was a teacher (mu'allim), hence the name Ibn al-Mu'allim. The title \\"al-Mufid\\" was given to him either by Muhammad al-Mahdi, the twelfth Shia Imam, or by al- Rummani, a Sunni scholar, after a conversation with him. The leader of the Shia community, he was a mutakallim, theologian, and Shia jurist. He was taught by Al-Shaykh al-Saduq, Ibn Qulawayh, Abu Abdallah al-Basri and al- Rummani, and Sharif al-Murtaza and Shaykh Tusi were among his students. Only 10 of his 200 works have survived, among which are Amali, Al-Irshad, Al- Muqni'ah, and Tashih al-Itiqadat.  Early life and education  Al-Mufid was born in 'Ukbara, a small town to the north of Baghdad, on 11th Dhul Qa'dah in 336 Hijra. According to Shaykh Tusi, however, he was born in 338AH, and later migrated with his father to Baghdad, where the Shia Buwayhids were ruling. He studied with Ibn Babawayh. Sharif al-Murtaza and Shaykh Tusi were among his students. His career coincided with that of the Mu'tazili theologian and leader of the Bahshamiyya school, 'Abd al-Jabbar. Al-Mufid was often attacked, and his library and school were destroyed. He was also called Ibn Muallim, meaning \\"son of the teacher\\"; Muallim was his father. Among his teachers were the Shia theologian Abu Ali al-Iskafi, Abu Abdallah al-Marzubani, Abu Abdallah al-Basri, Abu al-Hassan, and Ali ibn Isa al-Rummani. Commonly known as the leader of the Shia, Al-Mufid is regarded as the most famous scholar of the Buyid period and an eminent jurist, mainly due to his contributions in the field of kalam. According to Ibn al-Nadim, who knew al-Mufid personally, he was the head of the Shia Mutekallimun in the field of kalam, and al-Tawhidi, who was also personally familiar with al-Mufid, described him as \\"eloquent and skillful at dialectic (jadal)\\". His skill in polemical debate was such that he was said to be capable of convincing his opponents \\"that a wooden column was actually gold\\". He was taught the Islamic science of hadith by Al-Shaykh al- Saduq. =His nickname \\"al-Mufid\\"= It is said that al-Mufid earned his name \\"al-Mufid\\" as a result of a dispute about the relative merits of two events, the Ghadir Khumm and the Cave. Al-Mufid participated in a lecture given by Isa al-Rummani, where in a response to a question al-Rummani claimed that Ghadir Khum was based merely on riwayah (transmitted tradition), while the story of the Cave was based on diraya (knowledge). After the lecture, al-Mufid visited al-Rummani and asked him about Talha and Zubayr, who had rebelled against Ali, \\"a legitimate Imam\\". Al-Rummani responded that they had repented, and al-Mufid claimed that their repenting was merely based on riwaya. Al-Rummani then sent al-Mufid to al-Basri, with a note nicknaming the bearer \\"al-Mufid\\" (\\"the Instructor\\"). However, according to Ibn Shahr Ashub, in his Ma'alimul Ulamaa, the name was given to him by Muhammad al-Mahdi, the twelfth Shia Imam. As a theologian Taught by Abdallah al-Basri, the Mutazili theologian and hanafi jurist, al-Mufid adopted many theological opinions. Macdermott believes that al-Mufid's theology is closer to the old Baghdad school of Mutazilism than to Abdul Jabbar's late Basran system. His methodology is closer to that of the Baghdad school, and he seems to have followed the Baghdad school and Mutazilism in his views concerning such questions as God's unity and justice. However, al-Mufid differs from Mutazilism on the problem of Imamate and the position of grave sin in this life. Al-Mufid tried to defend the role of reasonhe described it as Al-Nazarand also disputed for the truth and put away faults with the help of argument and proofs. Also, al-Mufid believed that the task of a theologian was according to reason and argument. His views were adopted by his pupils, 'Abd al-Jabbar and Sharif al-Murtaza. =God's attributes= Al-Mufid defined God's unity in this way: According to al-Mufid, all believers in God's unity, save for \\"some eccentric anthropomorphists\\", agree with this. Like Mutazilis, al-Mufid rejected \\"the simple realism of the Ash'arite theory of attribution\\". However, al-Mufid and 'Abd al-Jabbar give different explanations of what an attribute is, and whether it is in an object or in the mind. =Prophecy= According to al-Mufid, there is an absolute necessity for prophets, since in order to know God and moral principles man needs revelation, and he noted that \\"every apostle (rasul) is a prophet but every prophet (nabi) is not an apostle\\". Although he took care to make a distinction between an apostle and a prophet as the Quran does, he did not believe that there was a difference in their functions, which enabled him to put the Imams on the level of the prophets and the apostles except in terms of their names. =Imamah= Al-Mufid defined the Imamiya as those who believe in the necessity of Imamah, Ismah and personal nass, i.e., personal designation. He tended to the belief that the Imams are superior to all the prophets and apostles, with the exception of Muhammad. According to al-Mufid, Imams can \\"take the place of the prophets in enforcing judgments, seeing to the execution of the legal penalties, safeguarding the Law, and educating mankind\\", a definition which makes an Imam not only \\"the head of the community in administrative, judicial, and military matters\\", but an \\"authoritative teacher of mankind\\". This attitude regarding Shia Imam is the basis of other teaching in Mufid theology such as Imam‚Äôs immunity from sin and error, the necessity of having an imam in all the times and the way the Imam should be designated. =His criticisms of Al-Shaykh al-Saduq= On a number of occasions al-Mufid was a critical of his teacher, Al-Shaykh al-Saduq, and his Tashih al-Itiqadat was a correction of al-Saduq's Risalat al-Itaqadat. Not limiting himself to theological matters, al-Mufid rejected al-Saduq's resort to akhbar al-ahad (single tradition), particularly when a legal statement is to be issued. However, he did not object to al-Saduq's views concerning the extent of the Quran; he only criticized his views on the nature of the Quran. Unlike al-Saduq, al-Mufid accepted \\"religious and speculative theology\\". While al-Saduq allowed controversy \\"only in the form of quoting and explaining the words of God, the Prophet, and the Imams\\", reporting a tradition from Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam of Shia, al-Mufid believed that there were two kinds of disputationnamely, \\"true\\" and \\"vain\\". Works Shaykh al-Mufid is said to have written 200 works, of which only a few more than ten have survived. Some of his works are as follows: * Al-Amali (of Shaykh Mufid), also known as \\"Al- Majaalis\\", traditions recorded by al-Mufid's pupils during the sessions where al-Mufid gave the chain of narration ending up with himself * Tashih al- Itiqadat, a correction of al-Saduq's Risalat al-Itiqadat * ŸéAwail Al Maqalat, an elaboration of al-Mufid's theology and \\"a practical catalogue of Imamite positions on disputed questions\\" * Kitab al-Irshad or Al-Irshad fi ma'rifat hujaj Allah 'ala al-'ibad, on the lives of the Shia Imams * Al-Fusul al-\`Ashara fi al-Ghaybah * Ahkam al-Nisa, on legal obligations regarding women * Fifth Risalah on Ghaybah * Al-Muqni'ah (The Legally Sufficient) The commentary on this book by Shaykh Tusi, Tadhhib al-Ahkam fi Sharh al-Muqni'ah, is among the Shia four books. Tawqees Al-Mufid received two Tawqees by Muhammad al-Mahdi during major occultation.  Death  Al-Mufid died on the third day of Ramadan in 413AH. According to the Shia writer Shaykh Tusi, \\"The day of his death drew the largest crowd ever seen in any funeral, and both friends and foes wept uncontrollably\\". He remained buried in his own house for two years, after which his body was moved to Al Kadhimiya Mosque and buried next to his teacher, Ibn Qulawayh al-Qummi. His grave is near the feet of two of the Shia Imams, Musa al-Kadhim and his grandson Muhammad al-Jawad. In popular culture The ninth day of Azar in Iran's official calendar is the commemoration day of Shaykh al-Mufid. An image of Mofid has been shown as imaginary in a paint.

The object of the game is to score goals by pushing one of the two pucks into the opposing player's goal. This task is accomplished by shooting small metal ball bearings at the pucks using the attached guns. The earliest version of the game featured a flat board, whereas the new board is dome-shaped. This causes the ball bearings to roll into the players' bins more easily, but can cause the pucks to indefinitely rest at the edges of the board. Gameplay The two pucks are made of plastic and rest on a central metal ball bearing. The bearing can spin and roll within the plastic mould allowing greater puck movement and responsiveness to hits.

Early years Hart was born in Edmonton, Alberta, was educated in Calgary and completed his military training at Canadian Forces Fleet School Halifax, CFB Borden and CFB Esquimalt. He served in the Canadian Forces twice, first for 5 years in the navy. After training as an Electrical Technician Hart served on 3 of Her Majesty's Canadian Ship's; (HMCS) Gatineau, Qu'Appelle and Yukon. Hart served an addition 5 years as a Canadian Armed Forces Reserve officer and Commanding Officer of the 902 Kiwanis Air Cadet Squadron. Mr. Hart completed his broadcasting training at the Columbia Academy of Radio and Television Arts in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1981. Hart has also studied at the Canadian Securities Institute, completing the Canadian Securities Course and the Ethics, Conduct and Practices Program. Prior to entering political life, Hart worked in the broadcasting industry as radio host, television host, account executive and radio station manager. Political career In 1988, Hart was elected to municipal government and served two terms as a Trustee. In 1989, he joined a new national political movement, the Reform Party of Canada, which became the Canadian Alliance in 2000. Hart was first elected 1993 to represent the riding of Okanagan‚ÄîSimilkameen‚ÄîMerritt, British Columbia, in the Canadian parliament. He was re-elected in 1997 in the new riding of Okanagan‚ÄîCoquihalla. In 1998, as a member of Canada's official opposition, he was elected by his peers as the Vice Chairman of the House Standing Committee of Defense and Veterans‚Äô Affairs. As well, Hart was appointed as Chief Opposition Critic for a number of senior portfolios including Defense, Veterans‚Äô Affairs, and Justice. He also served as an executive member on the Canada/Japan and NATO Parliamentary Associations. After publicly attacking Reform Party leader Preston Manning and accepting the Parliamentary Pension Plan, Hart briefly quit the Reform caucus before publicly apologizing to be accepted back into the caucus.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/reform-caucus- meets-in-banff-1.161485 In March 1996 Hart accused Jean-Marc Jacob, Member of Parliament for Charlesbourg, of sedition for a 1995 communique sent by him (Jacob) to members of the Armed Forces in Quebec concerning the October 30, 1995 separation referendum in that province. The Speaker ruled the matter prima facie, Mr. Hart moved a motion, which after debate was amended, and the House referred the matter to committee for study. See debates, March 12, 1996, pp. 557‚Äì67; March 13, 1996, pp. 648‚Äì74; March 14, 1996, pp. 680‚Äì703; March 18, 1996, pp 854‚Äì9. On June 18, 1996 the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs presented its Twenty-Ninth Report which found that although Mr. Jacobs actions were ill-advised, there was no contempt of the House. See Journals June 18, 1996, pp. 565‚Äì6; June 20, 1996, pp. 592‚Äì3 (House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Robert Marleau and Camille Montpetit )'' The communique urged Canadian Armed Forces personnel, along with equipment and military hardware to immediately join the new Quebec Armed Forces the day after a \\"yes\\" vote in the referendum. The referendum failed to win a majority. Inquiry Hart resigned as a Member of Parliament in order so that newly elected Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day could enter the House of Commons through a by-election. After the by-election, Hart received a severance payment of $50,000 from the Canadian Alliance, which prompted a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) inquiry. The Canadian Alliance maintained that the payment was made to cover lost income between the time of his resignation and the date of the next election, and was not an inducement. The RCMP inquiry concluded that an investigation was not necessary and that neither Hart nor the Canadian Alliance had committed a criminal offence, and no charges were ever laid in the matter. Later career Since leaving Parliament, Hart started a Public and Government Relations business, with clients including the British Columbia Naturopathic Association, and continued to speak publicly about proposed changes to health care regulations in British Columbia. In 2004 Hart moved to the Republic of Georgia and worked as a parliamentary adviser to H.E. Speaker Nino Burjanadze. In 2005, Hart received an honorary doctorate from Georgian Technical University for his work in parliament and promoting democracy in Georgia. In May 2008 the Harts returned to Georgia.

The ritual is a part of the bhagavathi or bhadrakali cult. The dance is performed in bhadrakali temples, the temples of the Mother Goddess, between February and May after the harvesting season. In 2010 Mudiyettu was inscribed in the UNESCO‚Äôs Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, becoming the second art form from Kerala after Koodiyattam.  The Kali - Darika myth  Darika was a demon who received a boon from Brahma which granted that he would never be defeated by any man living in any of the fourteen worlds of Hindu mythology. This made Darika immensely powerful and arrogant. Armed with this boon, Darika went on to conquer the world defeating even Indra, the king of the gods. As his atrocities became intolerable, the sage Narada requested Shiva to contain Darika. Shiva agreed, circumventing Brahma's boon by declaring that Darika would be killed by the goddess Kali, she being a woman and one not to be counted among men from fourteen worlds.  Features of Mudiyett  Mudiyett is a village ritual performed by members of the Marar and Kuruppu communities in Thrissur, Ernakulam, Kottayam and Idukki districts of Kerala. However, the entire community contributes to and participates in it. Mudiyettu is performed annually in ‚ÄòBhagavati Kavus‚Äô, the temples of the goddess, in different villages along the rivers Chalakkudy Puzha, Periyar and Moovattupuzhahttp://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg;=00011&RL;=00345 There is no rehearsal or preparation involved in playing Kali. The performance is a natural progression from Lord Shiva, Narada, demons Danavan and Darikan to Kali. A complete Mudiyettu performance requires a total of 16 persons‚Äî including percussionists, Kalamezhuthu artists, vocalists. There are also evident regional differences in the attire and performance styles of Mudiyettu. Thus, in the Koratty style, Kali exhibits a bare torso, covered only by a breast-shaped plank while in the Keezhillam and the Pazhoor styles, she wears a full upper body dress. Similarly, in the Koratty style, Darika's mudi resembles the Kathakali crown and his face paint the Kathi Veshas of Kathakali. This points to how the two forms have become interlinked even though Mudiyettu predates Kathakali, with epigraphists tracing its evolution as an art to even the 9th or 10th century AD.  The role of the community  Mudiyettu is a communal undertaking in which each caste of the village plays a specific role. The bamboo artefacts and leather hides for drums are provided by the Parayan caste while the Thandan caste brings the areca nut fronds that are required for the masks and headgears. The Ganakan community paints the masks while the Kuruvan community keeps the country torches burning. It is the Veluthedan (Patiyan) caste that washes the clothes used for making the deity‚Äô's dress while the Maran caste readies the torches and keeps them supplied with oil. Thus each caste in the village contributes to the festival according to its traditional caste role. Mutual cooperation and collective participation of each caste in the ritual instills and strengthens common identity and mutual bonding in the community.Nomination File No. 00345 For Inscription on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2010. UNESCO, 2010.  Transmitting and conserving Mudiyett  Being a community based art form it is the community that has traditionally encouraged and trained the next generation to preserve the art form. There is no school or institution to give training in this art form and its survival depends almost exclusively on direct transmission through the Guru-Shishya Parampara.

Early life Thomas Gray Boardman was born on 12 January 1919, just after the end of the First World War. He was educated at Bromsgrove School in Worcestershire (and later in life he became the \\"President of the School\\" from 1983 to 1994). His father was a landowner and Lord Mayor of Daventry, who farmed 500 acres in Northamptonshire. Like many of his generation, Boardman's formative years were shaped by the increasingly real prospect of war. On leaving school, Boardman paid ¬£500 to become an articled clerk with a local solicitor, but in 1938, despite an early interest in the law and politics, enlisted into the British Army as a trooper in the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry. Military service At the start of the World War II, Boardman was selected for training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on 14 September 1940. He was promoted through the ranks to Lieutenant-Colonel and commanded the 1st Battalion Northamptonshire Yeomanry during the North West Europe campaign. He won the Military Cross (MC) in Normandy during Operation Overlord, in the early part of the operation to trap German forces in the Falaise Pocket. After the D-Day landings in 1944, Boardman was detailed to act as navigator for four armoured columns formed from the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, and 1st Battalion Black Watch. The columns were to take Saint- Aignan-de-Cramesnil, about 20 kilometres south of Caen. On 6 and 7 August 1944, Boardman conducted reconnaissance in no man's land, despite German fire, to allow him to establish the route in darkness. In the night attack of 7/8 August, he then successfully spearheaded the columns forward through the Falaise Gap towards the village of St Aignan de Cramesnil, several times dismounting from his tank, and going back on foot to find parts of the columns which had lost touch. He had to illuminate the way forward with Very lights, making himself a highly visible target for enemy fire. Having used all his flares, Boardman had to run back to the second tank in the column to find more, in so doing he almost fell into a slit trench full of Germans; but the objective was achieved. On 8 August 1944, Kurt Meyer, of the SS Hitlerjugend Division, ordered elements of his command to counterattack and recapture the high ground taken by The Allies. Michael Wittmann 'The Black Baron' a notable German Waffen-SS tank commander, led a group of seven Tiger tanks, from the Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101, supported by additional tanks and infantry. Boardman, with A Squadron 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, ambushed the Tigers crossing open terrain towards the high ground from the tree line. It was Boardman's order to the gunner Joe Ekins, which killed Wittman. According to the historian Hart, Boardman's unit was positioned in a wood on the right flank of the advancing Tiger tanks. At approximately 12:47, they engaged them, halting the attack, and killing Wittmann. Boardman's squadron (of which he was second in command) beat off the heavy counter-attack and the citation for his Military Cross gives much of the credit for this, and the destruction of 12 German tanks, to him. His MC was gazetted on 21 December 1944. Boardman was later the Commanding Officer of the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, when they became part of the Territorial Army. Political Service At the end of the World War II, Boardman took his law exams at Gibson & Wheldon (subsequently renamed The University of Law) and passed out top. He qualified and practised as a solicitor in Northampton, and served on the boards of several companies; his sound judgment made him a valued contributor to business as director. He became the Finance Director of Allied Breweries and, in 1958, he became chairman of Chamberlain Phipps, the Wellingborough manufacturer of adhesives, insulation, cladding and footwear components. He held this position until 1978. Boardman's interest in Conservative politics brought his adoption as the Conservative candidate for Leicester South-West, where he fought Labour's Chief Whip, Herbert Bowden, in the 1964 and 1966 elections. Bowden was elevated to the House of Lords in 1967 and Boardman, at the age of 48, then won the parliamentary seat in a sensational by-election beating the Labour candidate Neville Sandelson and turning a Labour majority into a Conservative majority of 3,939 (15.7 per cent). It was a period of considerable Conservative success and Boardman consolidated his hold on the seat. In 1970, he beat off a fierce Labour challenge by just 106 votes. By then, his fellow Conservatives had already elected him to the executive of the 1922 Committee and he was chairman of the parliamentary panel of the Institute of Directors. Business commitments prevented him accepting the first government job offered to him, as Principal Private Secretary to Margaret Thatcher. Boardman's skills had been rapidly recognised by the incoming Conservative government of Edward Heath in 1970. He quickly earned a reputation for speaking publicly only about subjects that he knew well, particularly in the realms of industry and commerce. In April 1972, he was made Minister for Industry at the Department of Trade and Industry, where he was seen by many as a powerful advocate of progress in industry. Heath brought Boardman in to help take forward the industrial expansion programme, in a reshuffle which followed the unveiling of the Industry Bill. This was Heath's notorious 'U-turn' on industrial policy, in which a free market approach was abandoned in favour of a return to intervention, subsidy for 'lame ducks' and price controls. Following the 1972 miners' strike, Boardman steered the Coal Industry Act through Parliament; it injected huge subsidies to keep the National Coal Board solvent. Having achieved a record pay award as part of that settlement, the miners were quiescent until the summer of 1973, when they demanded another 35 per cent. Boardman and his fellow junior minister, Peter Emery, represented the government in the negotiations that followed, in which the National Coal Board tabled a formula which offered the maximum allowed by Heath's \\"Stage Three\\" pay code, plus a further slice linked to productivity. This left no room at all for further negotiation from the National Coal Board 's side. But any hope that the miners' leader, Joe Gormley, could persuade his executive to accept it was ended by the machinations of his hard-Left colleague Mick McGahey, who told Heath that he wanted to see the government fall. Although others have criticised the National Coal Board for offering the miners too much too soon, Boardman always defended them, believing that the legislation made that inevitable and that any concessions would have to be found outside the code. He was also clear that if the mineworkers were made a special case, other unions would have been forced to exploit it. He had in mind Frank Chapple at the EETPU, who told him bluntly that, \\"if those buggers get a farthing more\\" than his own workers, he could stop the country in 48 hours. Boardman took part in the talks with the miners and he evidently impressed Heath. Meanwhile, war had broken out in the Middle East, and Arab oil producers had dramatically raised the price of oil. This strengthened the miners' hand, and in November they instigated an overtime ban. With both oil and coal supplies threatened, the government declared a State of Emergency. In an atmosphere of extreme tension, Boardman bore the brunt of administering the emergency measures, which involved a ban on non-essential uses of electricity and restrictions on heating in shops and offices. There was also a plan to cut heating in schools. But the education secretary, Margaret Thatcher, who had heard the news on a radio programme, had not been consulted. Furious, she stormed into Boardman's office. \\"After what the diplomats would describe as frank exchanges, [I] had it stopped,\\" she recalled in her memoirs. Boardman was admired for his calmness under fire. He reassured the public that power-station coal stocks would hold out through the winter; and, when a row broke out about possible petrol rationing, he played down his ministry's preparations as \\"purely administrative action ‚Ä¶ officials are looking to see whether the mice have eaten the ration books\\". He was frequently called to Downing Street to take part in talks with leaders of the National Union of Mineworkers, and with representatives of the oil sheikdoms. And he set a widely appreciated example at the height of the shortages by exchanging his ministerial car for a smaller model. He also made a point of letting it be known that he had turned down the thermostat on his oil-fired central heating. Boardman showed his steel when he refused the gas workers a court of inquiry over their industrial dispute against Stage II of the prices and incomes policy: \\"There is nothing to inquire into,\\" he told the Commons. He ran energy policy during the first great oil shock until Heath, against the wishes of both Lord Peter Walker and Boardman, decided that there should be a new energy ministry. Boardman was a politician of charm and ability, noted for his loyalty and for the meticulousness with which he prepared his case and redrafted every statement or document emanating from his office. He was also a very patient listener to the problems of industry, at a time of soaring costs and shop floor militancy. His only fault, according to his ministerial boss, Lord Walker, was that \\"he worked too hard and worried too much ‚Ä¶ I had great difficulty in seeing that Tom got enough sleep and relaxation at weekends\\" His success as a minister was confirmed by promotion to be Chief Secretary to the Treasury in the dying days of the Heath government, but a long career on the front bench was denied him by the defeat of the Government in the February 1974 election and the loss of his own seat to the Labour Party's Jim Marshall. Boardman had been a well- liked and respected Member of Parliament, but, with his party doomed to opposition his mainstream political career came to an end. Businessman Boardman rejoined the Allied Breweries board in 1974, rising to vice-chairman the next year. He also became joint honorary treasurer of the Conservative Party, a post he held until 1982. He managed to buy the Tory central office site at Smith Square from Westminster council for ¬£1.32m - enabling it to be sold for three times the amount only two years later. He was president of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce for three years from 1977 and served on the council of the Confederation of British Industry. Boardman remained politically involved. Announced in the 1980 Birthday Honours, he was created a life peer as Baron Boardman, of Welford in the County of Northamptonshire on 10 July 1980. In 1978, Boardman became chairman of the building materials group Steetley Industries (he had been a director since 1975), the construction materials group. In 1979, Boardman joined the board of the National Westminster Bank and followed Lord Kingsdown (who became Governor of the Bank of England) into the chair in 1983. This was a period in which NatWest was overtaking Barclays to become the market leader in High Street banking, and pursuing grand ambitions, notably in investment banking and in North America. \\"Our philosophy is, and was, and remains that we are going to be a major player in the global market,\\" Boardman proclaimed in 1988 Changes at National Westminster during the Boardman era included returning to Saturday opening in 1985 after 16 years; waiving charges on current accounts in credit; becoming involved in the International Stock Exchange through the ‚ÄúBig Bang‚Äù deregulation of 1986; meeting the requirements of the 1986 Financial Services Act; and taking over First Jersey National Corporation of the US. In 1988 National Westminster's shares were listed on the Tokyo stock exchange for the first time. Boardman's avowed technique was to support his management team without getting involved in day-to-day management. In his decade with what was then the biggest high street bank, Boardman helped make Natwest the country's most profitable and dynamic. Unhappily though, some of his subordinates cut corners, notably at County Natwest, whose handling of the Blue Arrow takeover of Manpower was savaged by inspectors at the Department of Trade and Industry - to Boardman's fury. Three top executives resigned, and Boardman stepped down three months early in 1989. Although not personally implicated in the fraud, and ignorant of any wrongdoing, Boardman chose to resign a few months before his term of office was due to end. Boardman was chairman of the committee of London & Scottish Clearing Bankers from 1987 in the last two years of a very successful term of office until his resignation from NatWest in 1989. He was also a director of MEPC, the property company. In 1993, at the instigation of NatWest and other banks, he became chairman of Heron International, the troubled property group created by Gerald Ronson. In retirement, Boardman was active in the House of Lords almost until his death. He found more time to enjoy his life in Welford, Northamptonshire. A skilled horseman, he had ridden in earlier days in military steeplechases. He hunted with the Pytchley until he was well into his seventies, retiring only when his faithful mount Bramble became too old to continue. Boardman lived in Northamptonshire all his life, becoming Deputy Lieutenant of the county in 1977, and High Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1979. He was awarded honorary doctorates by Nottingham and City universities. Among his many charitable works, Boardman was chairman of the national appeal for the Prince's Youth Business Trust. Legal significance Boardman is also noteworthy in being the appellant in Boardman v Phipps [1967] 2 AC 46 (House of Lords) a leading case on fiduciary duty and constructive trusts. Although he was ultimately required to account to the trust for additional benefits that accrued from his actions, the courts commended him for the service he had delivered to the beneficiaries, to whom the court held he owed fiduciary duties. Whilst he lost and would technically have had to account for the profits, Boardman was allowed in fact to keep the greater part of the profit as reward for his service. Personal life Lord Boardman married Deirdre Chaworth-Musters (n√©e Gough) (1923-2014) in 1948, and the couple had two sons and a daughter (Lady Boardman also had a daughter by her first marriage). Their daughter Grania Janet Gray Boardman married Rupert Law, 9th Baron Ellenborough.

The name may refer to either scheduled ancient monument number ‚Äîa length of stone course just over long on Wheeldale Moor, or to a postulated extension of this structure, incorporating ancient monuments numbers and extending to the north and south for up to . The visible course on Wheeldale Moor consists of an embankment of soil, peat, gravel and loose pebbles in height and in width. The gently cambered embankment is capped with unmortared and loosely abutted flagstones. Its original form is uncertain since it has been subjected to weathering and human damage. The structure has been the subject of folklore in the surrounding area for several hundred years and possibly more than a millennium. Its construction was commonly attributed to a giant known as Wade, a figure from Germanic or Norse mythology. In the 1720s the causeway was mentioned in a published text and became known outside the local area. Within a few years it became of interest to antiquarians who visited the site and exchanged commentary on its probable historicity. They interpreted the structure as a causeway across marshy ground, attributing its construction to the Roman military, an explanation largely unchallenged throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The stretch of causeway on Wheeldale Moor was cleared of vegetation and excavated in the early twentieth century by a local gamekeeper with an interest in archaeology. Historian Ivan Margary agreed with its identification as a Roman road, and assigned it the catalogue number 81b in the first edition of his Roman Roads In Britain (1957). The causeway was further excavated and studied by archaeologist Raymond Hayes in the 1950s and 1960s, partly funded by the Council for British Archaeology. The results of his investigation, which concluded that the structure was a Roman road, were published in 1964 by the Scarborough Archaeological and Historical Society. In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, its identification as a Roman road has been questioned by academics, and alternative interpretations suggested for its purpose and date of construction. The monument's co-manager, English Heritage, in 2012 proposed several avenues of research that might be used to settle some of the questions that have arisen regarding its origins and usage. Description =Situation and geology= The area through which the Wheeldale structure runs is predominantly uncultivated heather moorland. Hayes believes its appearance has remained fundamentally unchanged since the Bronze Age when its forest cover was removed to permit cultivation and grazing. Wheeldale Moor is poorly drained in places making it susceptible to flooding in both the ancient and modern eras. The underlying geology consists of patches of sand and gravel on top of mixed sandstone and oolitic limestone, known as Ravenscar Group strata. = Construction = Cross-sectional diagram of Wade's Causeway, based on description given in Young (1817) and Hayes and Rutter (1964) The causeway's visible section on Wheeldale Moor shows the remains of a continuous surface metalled with closely fitted slabs of sandstone with flat upper surfaces. The average size of a slab is square, but some examples are in breadth. The purpose of a central ridge along one section of the causeway, described in two independent excavations, is unknown. The stone flags are seated on a cambered base of mixed gravel, clay and either rubble, peat or soil, that forms a raised embankment. The embankment is from wide at its raised surface. Its width in some sections is increased by of ditch to either side, which may or may not be associated with its original construction, making an approximately uniform total width of . Its height above surrounding soil level is approximately . Hayes and Rutter state that the primary purpose of such an embankment would have been to provide good drainage for a road surface. Archaeologist David E Johnston states that the structure is crossed by numerous perpendicular drainage culverts with small becks trickling through them since the ground is often boggy. This could suggest a reason for the embankment, and its early attribution as a causeway‚Äîa route across wetland, normally supported on earth or stone in the form of a raised embankment. Nineteenth-century antiquarian Thomas Codrington argued that Roman roads in Britain were generally built on embankments regardless of the underlying ground's drainage. He states that the common appellation of \\"causeway\\" in the names of Roman roads may, therefore, relate to their embankments rather than indicate that the ground on which they were constructed was ill-drained. Some historians translate Livy's phrase for Roman military construction of roads, via munire, as \\"making a causeway\\". Johnston, historian Nikolaus Pevsner and landscape historian Richard Muir all agree that an original gravel surface dressing was once present on top of the stone of the Wheeldale structure. Whereas Johnston and Pevsner believe that the gravel was washed away through weathering, Muir states that human agents were primarily responsible for its removal. Both agree that the stonework remaining does not represent the original road surface. Statements by the eighteenth-century antiquary Francis Drake and nineteenth-century topographer Samuel Lewis that the writers found it to be \\"paved with a flint pebble\\" may support this theory, although Hayes and Rutter cast doubt on the accuracy of Drake's reports. Codrington states that in 1817 the causeway consisted of a \\"strong pavement of stones ... [with] above these another stratum of gravel ...\\", Hayes and Rutter state that \\"traces of a surface layer of gravel and small stones\\" remained visible in the 1960s, and professor of structural engineering John Knapton states that there remained some evidence of smaller surface-dressing pebbles as late as 1996. Codrington and archaeologist Frank Elgee consider the structure was flanked in a few sections by lateral parallel ditches but Hayes is doubtful whether they were part of the original construction or if they even existed. = Extant course = Map showing sections of Wade's Causeway reported as verified extant, by various authorities 1736‚Äì2013 The excavated portion of the Wheeldale structure‚Äîthe only section of a postulated greater extent that remains clearly visible to the naked eye‚Äîconsists of a section on the eastern edge of Wheeldale Moor, facing Howl Moor. It runs in an approximately north- northeasterly direction between and , and is approximately above sea level. The presence of large quantities of stone on a raised agger, and the absence of much vegetation on its surface, make the presence of the structure indisputable along this section. The causeway's course is linear along its visible section on Wheeldale Moor, consisting of several short, straight sections that pivot occasionally onto new alignments in a way not clearly demanded by the landscape. In 1855, several overgrown fragments of the structure were also reported visible at several points in the vicinity: near Morley Cross; east of Keys Beck; near Hazle houses; at July Park; and at Castle Hill. = Possible extended course = The structure is believed by several writers to extend far beyond its visible portion, but no significant sections of its conjectured course remain visible to the naked eye or have been excavated or extensively surveyed, and there is little agreement on an exact course that an extension may have taken. The total original length of the structure is therefore unknown, but may have been up to .  To the north  Early records of the causeway's course to the north‚Äîwhen its remains were apparently more readily visible than today‚Äîdiffer considerably from one another: the early geologist and natural historian George Young, who wrote in relation to the causeway in his History of Whitby, makes no clear mention of the route of the structure north of Wheeldale Moor; it is unmarked on the 1854 Ordnance Survey map of the area; and eighteenth-century historian Thomas Hinderwell's mention of it passing near Hunt House suggests a greatly differing route to that marked on 2012 Ordnance Survey mapping. At least one source states that a \\"conjectural\\" continuation to the north is visible in vertical aerial photography. Hayes reports that in his survey in the 1950s, he found \\"trace of the embankment\\" in one short section and \\"a patch of the metalling\\" in four additional sections along a route past Hazle Head and Julian Park. Beyond Julian Park, it has been conjectured that the structure originally continued to the Roman garrison fort at Lease Rigg, south west of Sleights, based on reports from antiquarians in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that fragments were visible at numerous points along this course. Hayes and Rutter appear confident of the structure's extent as far as Lease Rigg, but admit that its extent is conjectural from well short of that point, from Dowson Garth Quarry northwards. Numerous authors have conjectured that the structure was a road that continued past Lease Rigg all the way to Roman coastal fortifications or signal stations somewhere near Whitby, but this is debated. Drake reports in 1736 that an associate had followed its course from Wheeldale Moor to the coast at Dunsley Bay, but Codrington is dismissive of his account, and whether the author meant to imply that a visible structure had been followed, or simply that the associate had followed a proposed route without encountering it, is unclear. In either case, the author did not verify sight of the structure along this course himself. Several sources after 1805 report the same endpoint for the road but it is unclear whether they are echoing Drake or had visited the site themselves. Several authorities state that any termini beyond Lease Rigg are \\"doubtful\\" and \\"unproven\\", and Elgee states that the causeway's northern course \\"is obscure and its termination unknown\\". Hayes and Rutter in 1964 found no evidence for a continuation of the structure any further north than Lease Rigg. Other authorities argue for possible courses extending northwards to Goldsborough, Guisborough, or Sandsend Bay.  To the south  Surviving ditch and embankment in Cawthorn Roman Camp It has also been suggested that the structure originally extended southwards from Wheeldale Moor to link up to the Roman Cawthorne Camp (sometimes spelled 'Cawthorn'). In the twentieth century English Heritage identified two sections of ground on Flamborough Rigg and Pickering Moor as extensions of the Wheeldale structure. Hayes states that the Flamborough Rigg section remained \\"clearly visible\\" as late as 1961, and that additional sections near Keys Beck were visible in aerial photography from 1946. The accounts of Hinderwell, Young, and Hayes & Rutter, as well as the 1854 and 2012 Ordnance Survey maps, appear to corroborate the stated course of the structure along this section. There is further conjecture that the original structure's course may have gone beyond Cawthorne Camp to the Roman settlement of Derventio Brigantum (possibly either Stamford Bridge or modern-day Amotherby near Malton). Any postulated extension further south than Cawthorn is contested. Hinderwell reports in 1811 that the late Robert King had found evidence of a continuation of the causeway between \\"Newsom-bridge\\" and Broughton (a former township located near Appleton-le-Street). Hayes and Rutter failed to find any trace of the causeway south of Cawthorn along a route via Amotherby, Barugh or Newsham in their survey in the 1950s, and note that its course could not be determined as early as 1726. Beyond Malton, there is a postulated stretch of Roman road leading towards York, which it is possible may be an extension of the causeway. Evidence for it is very slim: it is mentioned by Drake in 1736, but Codrington could find no trace of it in 1903, and writes that there is \\"some uncertainty as to the connexion\\". Archaeologists Philip Corder and John Kirk reported a possible section of Roman road at Brandrith Farm () in 1928, but it is unknown whether this relates to the same structure as Drake observed, or has any association with the Wheeldale structure.  Legendary interpretations  Historian Hector Munro Chadwick states that historical explanations for ancient structures would have been known to educated clergymen from the seventh century, but that structures were generally named by less educated people, often after mythological characters. Oral folklore in the North York Moors area from the Early Middle Ages has not generally survived into the modern era, but social historian Adam Fox states that the attribution of the causeway to Wade existed in oral folklore dating from at least as early as the Renaissance era. The folklore held that the causeway was built by a giant called Wade for his wife to take her cow to either market or pasture. In 1890, historian Thomas Bulmer records that: The legend of Wade and his wife are reflected in alternative names for the structure that include \\"Old Wife's Trod\\", \\"Auld Wife's Trod\\" and \\"Wade's Wife's Causey\\". The folklore of Wade was still common locally in the early nineteenth century. There is some confusion as to whether the name Bel or Bell relates to Wade's wife, or to his cow. Bulmer refers in 1890 to \\"[Wade's] wife, Bell\\" and Young also assigns the name to Wade's wife in 1817. Hayes (1964) accepts this attribution but antiquarian Hilda Ellis Davidson believes that the folkloric Bel refers to Wade's cow and reflects an earlier tradition of the \\"fairy\\" or bountiful cow. The earliest published source of the legend, from 1779, is ambiguous and refers to \\"Bell Wade's cow\\". = Etymological history of early names = Causeway Several of the earliest sources refer to the structure as \\"Wade's Causeway\\", \\"Wade's Causey\\", and \\"Wade's Wife's Causey\\". The word causeway derives from the earlier English causey way or simply causey. Causey derives from the Middle English cauci, which derives from the Anglo-French causee, itself derived from the Medieval Latin calciata (\\"paved highway\\"), which ultimately may derive from the Latin calx (meaning \\"heel\\"). The derivation from calx can most likely be explained by the practice in the Ancient Roman era of consolidating earthworks through trampling with the heel of the foot. Wade It is not known for certain who the causeway is named after, but the figure was at the latest pre- Renaissance, and the majority of sources agree that it has its origins in the medieval period or earlier. The name Wade appears as one of the most common surnames in a 1381 poll tax register from Suffolk, and philologist P H Reaney reports multiple instances of it from the 11th and 12th centuries. The names Wade or Wada were common in pre-medieval English history and historian William Searle records around a dozen historic Wades in his Onomasticon of early Anglo-Saxon names. The earliest figure from the region identified as Wade in extant writings is Duke Wada, a historical personage of Saxon descent who is recorded in 1083 as having been a prominent figure living in the Yorkshire area around 798. It is possible that this person was either named after‚Äîor has been conflated over time with‚Äîone of several earlier, mythological figures known as Wade. Chadwick states that it is most probable that the causeway is named directly after a well-known mythological, rather than historical, Wada. The earliest origins of tales relating to a mythological Wade are confused and diverse. Linguist George McKnight states that the epic of Wade, although becoming a \\"mass of tales ... of the most diverse origin imaginable\\", was one of only a few clear examples of an epic from the Early Middle Ages surviving into Middle English. Geoffrey Chaucer, writing in the fourteenth century, makes reference to early English legends of Wade but these no longer exist in their complete form. Walter Map, writing in the twelfth century, also mentions a Vandal prince Gado (thought to be a Latin form of Wade) in his fantastical lay De Nugus Curialium. The Wades in these early English works likely relate to one or more earlier legendary figures known as Wade, or variations thereof, in Northern European folklore and legend. Various authors suggest links to: the giant Va√∞i, (also known as Witege, Vathe, Vidia, Widga, Vidga, Wadi or Vade) mentioned in the Norse Saga of Bern in the √ûi√∞rekssaga; the Danish hero Wate, also called Wada; the Anglo-Saxon deity W≈çden (also W≈çƒëanaz or W≈çƒëinaz), who was historically referred to as \\"heaven's giant\\"; and the German figure Wa-te, a fierce sea-king similar to Neptune, who reigns in Sturmland in the 7th-century saga Kudrun. Nurse and Chadwick identify all the above figures as being later facets of a single legendary character present in an early, shared mythology of tribes living around the rim of the Baltic and North Seas. There are possible etymological links between Wade's causeway and other UK archaeological sites: Wade's Gap on Hadrian's Wall in Northumbria; the Wansdyke that runs between Wiltshire and Somerset; and Wat's Dyke in the Welsh borders: all three have pre-modern origins and the latter two have sections contested as Roman in part. Bel There have been too few published studies on the etymology of the figure of Wade's Bel (whether that refers to his milkmaid wife or to the cow) to provide a firm etymological or mythological basis. Wade is firmly rooted in Norse mythology and there are parallels between Wade's cow/milkmaid wife Bel and the milkmaid figure of Beyla in Norse mythology, who some authorities have suggested derives etymologically from baula, meaning cow. There is no published work suggesting such a link, so the origin of the figure remains unproven. Skivick It is thought that Skivick or Skivik, the local name for the section of structure visible on Wheeldale Moor, could derive from two morphemes from Old Norse. The first syllable could derive from skei√∞, which could mean either a track or farm road through a field, or from a word used to describe a course or boundary. The second syllable could derive from v√≠k, meaning a bay or a nook between hills. Scandinavian or Norse place-names are common in Yorkshire and Norse peoples settled in the Yorkshire area from 870 AD onwards following raiding over the previous seventy years. Sawyer states that early Norse colonists had a profound effect on place-names in the areas in which they settled. Sedgefield states that the skei√∞ derivation specifically in place- names within northern England points to Scandinavian settlement of the area, but that due to the inheritance of language across generations, a place-name containing skei√∞ may in any individual case have been applied any time between the ninth and fifteenth centuries. Historian Mary Atkin states that skei√∞ place-names appear near Roman sites frequently enough to suggest an associative link.  Investigations, surveys and excavations  = Discovery and initial records = John Warburton, the first antiquarian to mention Wade's Causeway in a published work The sixteenth-century antiquarian John Leland passed through the area in around 1539 when compiling his Itineraries of local English history and mentions the nearby and mythologically-linked \\"Waddes Grave\\" ‚Äì standing stones at Mulgrave near Whitby. He appears not to have had Wade's Causeway brought to his attention by local antiquarians, since he makes no mention of it. In 1586, antiquarian William Camden makes passing note of the fact that, in parts of England, locals take \\"Roman fabriks to be the work of Gyants\\", but, although mentioned in the context of Roman roads, this appears to refer to the folklore of the time in general rather than to Wade's causeway specifically. He makes no mention of Wade's causeway by name, despite having toured the area, which‚Äîas Drake remarks in 1736‚Äîis \\"odd ... when he was upon the spot\\". The first modern written record that unquestionably relates to the Wheeldale structure was in 1720 by the antiquarian John Warburton. This first publication of the existence of the structure was followed by debate over the structure's function, course and history amongst local historians and antiquarians in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as its existence came to broader attention. In a private letter dating from October 1724, Thomas Robinson of Pickering states that approximately of the structure, which he describes as a road, were visible at that time, stretching south from Dunsley village: Drake personally visited and examined a length of the structure and incorporated its description into one of his published works (1736). The causeway was also mentioned in nineteenth century publications by Walley Oulton (1805), Thomas Hinderwell (1811), George Young (1817), John Phillips (1853), Robert Knox (1855), George Bevan (1884), John Atkinson (1894) and Ralph Horne (1897); and in the twentieth century by Thomas Codrington (1903), Boyd Dawkins, A Austen (1903), Frank Elgee (1912,1923,1933), Kitson Clark (1935), Ivan Margary (1957), Hayes & Rutter (1964) and Nikolaus Pevsner (1966). = Pre-war excavations = Tempest Anderson, a prominent figure in the Yorkshire Archaeological Society, who assisted in the early years of the excavations before his death in 1913 The first recorded excavations of the structure are in the Victorian era: after performing some preliminary clearing of a part of the Wheeldale Moor section of the causeway in the 1890s, Wheeldale Lodge gamekeeper James Patterson persuaded the Office of Works (now the Department of the Environment) in 1912 to transfer into its stewardship the full stretch of the causeway over Wheeldale Moor. Working alongside Oxley Grabham from the York Museum, members of the Yorkshire Archaeological Society and several private individuals, Patterson cleared and excavated the adopted stretch of causeway between 1910 and 1920. A further section, near Grosmont Priory, was excavated by Hayes between 1936 and 1939. = Post-war excavations and surveys = Historic England's PastScape website mentions further, minor, excavations of small sections of the causeway in 1946 and 1962, and archaeologist Hayes relates extensive excavations that he carried out between 1945 and 1950 at Riseborough, Cawthorn, Flamborough Rigg, Lease Rigg, Grosmont Priory and to the west of Aislaby. This work was partly funded by the Council for British Archaeology, and his findings published in an extensive study titled Wade's Causeway in 1964. The previous year the course of the structure across Wheeldale was surveyed by the Whitby Naturalists Club. English Heritage have also published records of later survey works by the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (1981) and Plowman Craven and Associates (1984). The Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (RCHME) undertook a theodolite survey of the causeway in 1992, and some limited excavations and analysis were carried out in 1997 during maintenance work on the structure. The most recent published survey that has been performed is an aerial survey carried out in 2010/2011 by Archaeological Research Services Ltd (ARS) as part of English Heritage's National Mapping Programme. = Future archaeological work = Professor Pete Wilson, on behalf of English Heritage's Portico Properties Research Project, has suggested questions for future research and investigation of the site, including: excavation to establish its date and function; examination of historic documentation for medieval mention of use of the monument as a route or in a boundary dispute; and analysis of the site via a detailed aerial survey, lidar or other remote sensing technique to establish the extent of the monument beyond the length so far excavated. The possibility also exists to apply newer techniques such as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) testing to attempt to date any bricks, pottery, or other fired materials found in situ in the structure, a method that was successfully used in the identification of a suspected Roman road near Bayston Hill in Shropshire.  Theories on structure's origins and purpose  A wide variety of interpretations for the structure have led, in the absence of any hard evidence, to a broad range of proposed dates for its construction, from 4,500 BC to around 1485 AD. In archaeological excavations, no coins or other artefacts have been found on or around the structure to aid its dating, and no evidence has been gathered through radiometric surveys. This has led to great difficulty in establishing even an approximate date for the causeway's construction. Attempts to date the structure have therefore relied on less precise means including etymology, the structure's probable relationship in the landscape to other structures of more precisely established date and function, and the comparison of the causeway's structure and fabrication to structures such as Roman roads. =As a Roman causeway= Cross-sectional diagram of an idealized Roman road from Britain, based on Weston (1919), Smith (2011) and other sources Cross-sectional diagram of Wade's Causeway, based on description given in Young (1817) and Hayes and Rutter (1964) The first antiquarians to discuss the site in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, dismissed early folkloric explanations of the structure's origins. Roman roads were of particular interest to eighteenth-century antiquarians, and they sought to explain the Wheeldale structure in the context of Roman activity in the North York Moors area in the first and second centuries AD. Specifically, it was commonly suggested in their writings that the causeway was most probably constructed to connect the Roman Cawthorne Camp to the south with the Roman garrison fort at Lease Rigg near Grosmont to the north. The excavated section of the structure does lie in a linear fashion approximately between these two sites, which Knight et al. believe lends credence to its being of Roman origin. Its average reported width of approximately plus wide lateral ditches flanking either side matches closely to the width of other Roman roads in Britain (e.g. Stanegate at ) as well as to the average of for Roman roads internationally; historian John Bigland, writing in 1812, also states that there is no other plausible alternative for the structure's scale and method of construction than \\"Roman industry and labour\\". One objection to identifying the road as Roman was that, based on readings of the Iter Britanniarum‚Äîthe section of the 4th-century Itinerary of Antoninus that lists major Roman Roads and stations within Britain‚Äîthere had never been any major Roman roads in the area. In 1817, Young attempted to address this problem by arguing that the course of one of the identified iters (iter 1) had been misinterpreted and ran between Malton and Dunsley, passing through Wheeldale. Such an argument was possible because the Iter Britanniarum was not a map, but rather a list or itinerary of roads and their distance between various settlements. Roman names for settlements were used in the document and, since many of these named sites had not been conclusively matched to contemporary settlements, identification of exact routes listed in the Iter was often difficult. There were few other objections at the time to the causeway's identification as a Roman road and by the twentieth century the causeway was commonly being referred to as the \\"Wheeldale Roman Road\\", or \\"Goathland Roman Road\\". There was also support for the identification of the structure as a Roman road on etymological grounds. The early twentieth-century literary scholar Raymond Chambers argued that the name \\"Wade's causeway\\" is an example of Angle and Saxon settlers arriving in Britain and assigning the name of one of their heroes to a pre-existing local feature or area: if his argument that the structure was given its current name sometime during the Saxon era‚Äîbetween approximately 410 and 1066 AD‚Äîis accepted, then it must have been constructed prior to these dates. Atkin reaches a similar conclusion, arguing that the Norse morpheme skei√∞ that is a partial root for Skivick, a local name for a section of the structure, is commonly found amongst Roman structures that are discernible by later Saxon or Viking settlers. Hayes and Rutter also identify the structure as a Roman road, but using a quite different etymological argument: they state that there is an absence among the names of settlements along the causeway of the Anglo-Saxon morphemes ceaster and stret and that, as per Codrington, these morphemes would be expected to be found in the names of several sites that lie alongside a former Roman road. They conclude that the absence of settlements with such names along the postulated extended course of Wade's Causeway indicates that the structure must already have been abandoned and of little significance by the Anglo-Saxon period (), most likely by around 120 AD, and must therefore be of early Roman origin. Several authorities who accepted the structure's interpretation as a Roman road attempted to make more precise estimates of the date of its construction by identifying periods of Roman military activity in the region, since the majority of Roman roads were of military construction. Historian Albert Norman, writing in 1960, states that the Wheeldale structure most probably dates from either the first or fourth century AD but most sources appear to favour a first-century date: both historian Brian Hartley and Hayes & Rutter estimate around 80 AD; and Elgee estimates 86 AD. The earlier, first-century, estimates assume that the road is Roman and that Roman road-building in the region occurred around the time that Gnaeus Julius Agricola was the Roman governor of Britain. Agricola made a concerted effort to expand and consolidate Roman control over lands of the Brigantes tribes in the North York Moors area in the 80s AD and is thought to have ordered the construction of nearby Lease Rigg fort. The fourth-century estimates, by contrast, assume that the tribes in the North York Moors area were either bypassed or subdued in the first century but that, being of little importance strategically, their lands were not subject to Roman occupation or construction until the fourth century. A second wave of Roman military activity appears to have occurred in the region during this later period in response to new military incursions and raiding by Saxons, Picti, Scoti and Attacotti. The east coast of the North York Moors area formed the northern flank of the Saxon Shore defences believed to have been constructed against this perceived threat. The above explanations all place the causeway within a Roman military context. An alternative, or perhaps secondary, usage for the causeway in Roman times is suggested by landscape author Michael Dunn and others, who state that it may have been constructed for the transport of jet inland from Whitby. Hayes and Rutter are dismissive, stating that the value of jet mined in the Roman period would not have justified the expense of the causeway's construction. A possible issue with the causeway's identification as a Roman structure in the latter half of the twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one vantage point to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive. The use of dressed stone rather than gravel as a surface dressing was also occasionally held to be a sign against the causeway being of Roman construction: the majority of Roman roads that were finished with a material other than simple packed earth were dressed in either packed gravel or pebbles. There are other examples of Roman roads paved with stone blocks, including the section of the Via Appia‚Äîthe oldest major Roman route in Italy‚Äînear Albano. Historians Richard A Gabriel and Michael Grant state that of the of known Roman roads, over may have been stone-paved. The Roman writer Ulpian specifically differentiates between via munita, which always had a paved stone surface, and via glareata, which were earthed roads with either gravelled surfaces, or a gravelled subsurface and paving on top. The causeway may well have had a gravel surface dressing originally, which has been removed since through robbing and natural weathering. Another difference in construction detail between Wade's Causeway and a typical Roman road is its lack of a foundation of large stones. Codrington and archaeologist John Ward stress that the structure of Roman roads varied greatly depending upon their situation and the materials available, especially within Britain. For much of the twentieth century, the consensus remained that the road was most probably Roman. It was still referenced as an undoubted Roman road in a 1947 UK Government report and in 1957 Margary, the leading authority on Roman roads at the time, accepted the road as Roman and assigned it the catalogue number 81b in his list of Roman roads in Britain. In the late 1950s and early 1960s this was a definitive and unquestioned interpretation of the monument. Several works in the 1980s and 1990s stated that Roman-era road construction was still the most probable explanation of the structure. =As a pre-Roman or medieval road= Whilst nineteenth- and to a lesser extent twentieth-century attitudes often suggested that any well-constructed pre-modern road surface must be Roman, late twentieth-century archaeologists were more open to evaluating the structure within the context of a wider span of historical periods. After an early allowance by Phillips in 1853 that the causeway could be British rather than Roman there was little further investigation of such a possibility. In 1994, the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England began a review of the date or origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Detailed air photography of the Cawthorn camps in 1999 site failed to find evidence of a road leading towards Wheeldale Moor from the camps to which it is historically related, and the causeway does not obviously connect to the main Roman road network. Several writers around the turn of the millennium began to express doubt about the established narrative for the structure as a Roman road. Twenty-first century archaeologists then found several exemplars of other cambered, metalled roads that pre-date the Roman presence in Britain, and hence set precedence for the possibility of a pre-Roman origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Several sources from the mid-1990s onwards have suggested that the structure may be a pre-Roman (Iron Age) road of uncertain route or purpose. Blood and Markham (1992) have proposed an interpretation of the structure as a post-Roman (medieval) road, possibly relating to the wool trade, although this is harder to reconcile chronologically with etymological explanations for the structure's naming. English Heritage state that it is \\"quite possible\\" that the causeway was used as a road during the medieval period despite being built much earlier. Similarly Hartley, whilst accepting the structure as a Roman military road, believes it is unlikely that the causeway immediately fell out of use once its military use ceased. Drake recorded that by 1736 the causeway was \\"not now made use of\\", but there is no historical record covering its possible use as a road during the medieval period. =As a neolithic boundary structure= There are some objections to the interpretation of the structure as being a road at all, including the fact that several burial cists along the structure's course protrude through its surface by up to 0.4m, highly unusual for a road surface. Since 1997, authorities including English Heritage have accepted the possibility that the structure may not be a road. Archaeological consultant Blaise Vyner suggested in 1997 that the structure may be the collapsed and heavily robbed remains of a Neolithic or Bronze Age boundary wall or dyke. There are other Neolithic remains on the North York Moors, including boundary dikes, although Knight et al. report that the later Neolithic is very poorly represented archaeologically in the North York Moors area and neolithic use of the moors was likely very limited in extent. Bronze Age presence in the moors, including earthworks, is well represented generally in the archaeology of the area, and therefore is a more plausible origin. Evidence against the identification of the causeway as an early Neolithic structure includes the statement by Elgee in 1912 that the causeway had been identified as cutting across an earlier British earthwork just north of Julian Park, suggesting that it must post-date it. One possibility that could explain several of the anomalies in trying to definitively identify the site is the suggestion by Knight et al. that it was commonly observed practice in the area for dykes to be reused as trackways. To account for the uncertainty regarding the structure's original function, the term \\"Wheeldale Linear Monument\\" was introduced in the 2010s to refer to the structure. English Heritage in 2013 stated that the balance of opinion had swung to favour a prehistoric, rather than Roman, origin for the structure. , the uncertainty regarding the monument's purpose and origin is reflected by the information board at the end of the Wheeldale section of structure, where it meets the modern road. The original sign, pictured in 1991 states that the structure is a Roman road, whereas new signage installed in 1998 admits that the origin and purpose of the structure are unknown. =Significance of uncertainty over the structure's origin= If Wade's Causeway is conclusively determined to be other than a Roman road, it would not be the only example of long-standing misattribution of ancient structures as Roman roads. The most famous example is the Blackstone Edge Long Causeway, which was once acclaimed as one of the finest surviving Roman roads in Britain, and a structure around which there was \\"no doubt that ... [it] ... is Roman\\". It was accepted as Roman by archaeologists Hayes and Rutter, who also identified Wade's Causeway as Roman. Archaeologist James Maxim in 1965‚Äîa year after Hayes and Rutter published their findings on Wade's Causeway‚Äîstated that he had found a medieval pack-horse trail passing under Blackstone Edge, which it must therefore post-date. Subsequent research by the archaeological unit of the University of Manchester claimed that the Blackstone Edge road was most probably a turnpike dating from around 1735. Site management in the modern era The surviving section of the causeway on Wheeldale Moor was reported by 1903 to be overgrown with heather and up to a foot of soil. After being cleared of debris and overgrowth during excavations from 1910, it was by 1920 \\"stripped ... of the growth of turf and heather and ... perfectly clear for miles\\". The Office of Works then employed a labourer to keep the section of causeway on Wheeldale Moor clear of vegetation, an arrangement that appears to have survived after that organisation's change to the Ministry of Works in 1943 and later absorption into the Department for the Environment in 1970. Johnston states that the site was still maintained in 1979, but by 1994 the visible section of the causeway had been left to be covered by vegetation once more. Hayes and Rutter state that the greater postulated portion of the structure beyond that visible on Wheeldale Moor is difficult to trace due to its having been greatly damaged over the years by natural erosion, which they state has completely destroyed some sections. The structure as a whole has also been greatly damaged both deliberately and inadvertently by humans: as Ward writes, it is often the fate of historic structures such as roads to have \\"been levelled by the plough and plundered of their materials\\". There are specific mentions of damage to the causeway through ploughing, tree felling, the laying of water mains, attempts to clear vegetation and even, in the twentieth century, by the activity of both tracked and armoured vehicles. The structure has also been heavily and deliberately robbed of stone for use in local construction, such as roads, dry-stone walls, dikes and farm buildings, this robbing continuing from 1586 through to at least the early twentieth century. Young, writing in 1817, laments the robbing of stone from the causeway for use in the construction of a modern field boundary, writing: A change in attitudes, and awareness of the historical significance of the structure, led to a gradual shift from destruction to preservation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. English Heritage state that limited repair work or alterations on the structure were likely carried out in the nineteenth century, but exact details are unclear. In 1913 the Wheeldale structure was brought under legal protection from robbing and deliberate damage, when its conservation was guaranteed under the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act. In 1982 a proposal was made to re-cover the majority of the exposed section with topsoil in order to protect it from further damage, but this has not been carried out . There was some further, limited maintenance of some sections between 1995 and 1997 to control water erosion, in addition to major erosion repair at the southern end of the structure in 1997. There has been at least one report of deliberate vandalism to the structure, but the primary concern relating to visitors to the site is the possibility of damage caused through tread wear. The site is not heavily trafficked and any wear to the structure since the 1980s would likely be mitigated by the protection from the natural re-establishment of plant growth over its surface. Updates by the North York Moors National Park authority and English Heritage suggest that natural weathering and grazing sheep represent greater erosion risks to the structure than do human agents. , the site is managed by the North York Moors National Park Authority, in cooperation with English Heritage, through a Local Management Agreement. English Heritage do not man the site and permit free access at any reasonable time. The site receives up to a thousand visitors per month. In fiction Scottish Author Michael Scott Rohan drew on the legend of Wade's Causeway, as well as wider English, Germanic and Norse mythology, when he wrote his Winter of the World trilogy while living in Yorkshire. The books feature mention of a legendary giant, Vayde, who ordered to be built a causeway across the marshes. Other historic sites in close proximity English Heritage recognises the following historically significant sites in close proximity to Wade's Causeway: * Cairnfield on Howl Moor 510m south of Wheeldale Lodge, including an unenclosed hut circle settlement, field system and round burial cairns () * Simon Howe: a round cairn on Goathland Moor, two associated round barrows, a standing stone and a stone alignment () * Field system and cairnfield on Lockton High Moor, NNE of Needle Point () * Extensive prehistoric and medieval remains on Levisham Moor () * Two sections of Roman road on Flamborough Rigg () * Two sections of Roman road on Pickering Moor () * Cawthorn Roman forts and camp including a section of medieval trackway known as the Portergate () * Allan Tofts cairnfield, field system, burial cairns and prehistoric rock art, immediately south of Morton Close ()  Photographs (1912‚Äì1985)  File:Wade's Causeway on Wheeldale Moor, c. 1912.jpg|alt=Photograph of Wade's Causeway, taken in approximately 1912 and showing a relatively even surface of large, broad, flat stone slabs raised on a small embankment a couple of feet above the surrounding moor.|Wade's Causeway, File:Wade's_Causeway,_c._1918.png|alt=Photograph of Wade's Causeway, taken in approximately 1918 and showing a relatively even surface of large, broad, flat stone slabs raised on a small embankment a couple of feet above the surrounding moor|Wade's Causeway, File:Wheeldale Moor - geograph.org.uk - 1192132.jpg|alt=Photograph of Wade's Causeway, taken in approximately 1978, showing a car of the period parked at the start of the Skvick section of the structure|Wade's Causeway, File:Wades Causeway in 1984 (geograph 3268356).jpg|alt=Photograph of Wade's Causeway, taken in approximately 1985, showing the structure to be heavily covered in grass but many stones still visible|Wade's Causeway, References and footnotes =Explanatory notes= :Œ±.The Roman Dunu[m|s] Sinus, which Young and Drake place at Whitby, and Hinderwell and Calvert suggest may be either the village of Dunsley, or the bay just north east of it. :Œ≤.Blaise Vyner classifies the structure as Neolithic, which would place its earliest possible construction date at around 4,500 BC.

However, ganglioneuromas themselves are fully differentiated neuronal tumors that do not contain immature elements. Ganglioneuromas most frequently occur in the abdomen, however these tumors can grow anywhere sympathetic nervous tissue is found. Other common locations include the adrenal gland, paraspinal retroperitoneum, posterior mediastinum, head, and neck.  Symptoms  A ganglioneuroma is typically asymptomatic, and is typically only discovered when being examined or treated for another condition. Any symptoms will depend upon the tumor's location and the nearby organs affected. For example, a tumor in the chest area may cause breathing difficulty, chest pain, and trachea compression. If the tumor is located lower in the abdomen, it may cause abdominal pain and bloating. A tumor near the spinal cord may cause spinal deformity or spinal compression, leading to pain and loss of muscle control or sensation in the legs and/or arms. These tumors may produce certain hormones, which can cause diarrhea, an enlarged clitoris (in females), high blood pressure, increased body hair, and sweating.  Cause  There are no known risk factors for ganglioneuromas. However, the tumors may be associated with some genetic problems, such as neurofibromatosis type 1. Pathology Micrograph of a ganglioneuroma with the characteristic ganglion cells. H&E; stain. Pathologically, ganglioneuromas are composed of ganglion cells, Schwann cells and fibrous tissue. Ganglioneuromas are solid, firm tumours that typically are white when seen with the naked eye.  Diagnosis  Ganglioneuromas can be diagnosed visually by a CT scan, MRI scan, or an ultrasound of the head, abdomen, or pelvis. Blood and urine tests may be done to determine if the tumor is secreting hormones or other circulating chemicals. A biopsy of the tumor may be required to confirm the diagnosis.  Treatment  Ganglioneuroma of the adrenal gland.Because ganglioneuromas are benign, treatment may not be necessary, as it would expose patients to more risk than leaving it alone. If there are symptoms or major physical deformity, treatment usually consists of surgery to remove the tumor.  Prognosis  Most ganglioneuromas are noncancerous, thus expected outcome is usually good. However, a ganglioneuroma may become cancerous and spread to other areas, or it may regrow after removal. If the tumor has been present for a long time and has pressed on the spinal cord or caused other symptoms, it may have caused irreversible damage that cannot be corrected with the surgical removal of the tumor. Compression of the spinal cord may result in paralysis, especially if the cause is not detected promptly.

This is more popular in the districts of Trichur, Calicut and Palghat and it is performed in Hindu Temples and shrines meant for snakes. By performing this, the queen of snakes could be appeased. The performer starts dancing holding a torch in his hand using various types of music instruments. Thiri Uzhichchil is also performed as one of the items in Ayyappan Vilakku festival. This item is performed early morning at about 3 am after the Ayappa Jananam (Birth of Ayyappa) ritual and the Paal kindi ezhunnaLLippu (ritual procession of Ayyappa bringing tiger's milk). In the case of Thiri Uzhichchil in Ayyappan viLakku, the accompaniments are ilaththaaLam(cymbal) and Chenda (traditional Keralite drum). The Velichapaadu after uranju thuLLal (trance- like shivering and jumping continuously) starts with one thiri (flaming torch) and increases it to two and three and even goes up to five thiris. The thiri or pandam is a flaming torch made of group of cotton wicks strapped together by coconut leaf fronds. The wicks are fuelled by coconut oil, into which they are dipped before the performance. He wipes the flames on the body especially the arms, chest and back continuously dancing to the tune of the drums. The dance is a form of worship, Nrithya Pooja, on the eight sides of the ambalam (shrine) - in case of Ayyappan ViLakku the temple is constructed purely with banana stems without using any metallic items - with intricate steps and each section of the dance, ending with a crescendo on one of the eight sides. In addition to wiping the flames on the body, the performer also sticks the torch into the waist part of the kachcha (traditional dress) both on front and back side so that the flames almost touches his chin. The crescendo of the drumming and the dance culminates when he wipes the torch so vigorously on his arms, chest and back that it almost goes out. After the performance the performer offers the torch to all the spectator devotees to warm their palms and touch the palms to their faces (just like the traditional way Hindus take the camphor offering). The Velichappadu usually wears the white dothi and both red and black kachcha and also ties up the \\"waist belt of bells\\" (aramaNi) during the performance.

She received a new heart in 1984 at the age of 2 years, 10 months. The operation was performed at Stanford Hospital, Stanford, California by the team of Norman Shumway, one of the early pioneers of heart transplant surgery. Although considered almost conventional today, in the early 1980s heart transplants (in children especially) were extremely rare. Surgery At the time of Craze's procedure, an ethics committee was formed at Stanford to review the advantages and disadvantages of possible surgery for her. It was not known at the time if a donated heart would \\"continue to grow along with her body.\\" Her family pleaded for the surgery as she was gravely ill and weighed only 23 pounds. A decision to proceed was reached by the committee and the donor was a young girl from Utah who had been the victim of a car crash. Craze had three siblings who died of heart failure in infancy, and she was diagnosed at only 4 months old. Her surviving sibling, older brother Andrew, had a heart transplant at the age of 16. His operation preceded hers by one year, and Andrew was instrumental in pleading her case before the ethics committee. Craze was at the time of the operation the youngest patient to have received a heart transplant. She has had to rely on various medications throughout her life, some with severe side effects, including needing a kidney transplant surgery at the age of 15. Craze has been able to lead a normal life including activities such as playing junior high school volleyball, and attending Whittier College. She was an active member of the Ionian Society, a local sorority, and went on to graduate in 2004. In 2009, Craze worked in IT for Facebook in Palo Alto, California, and celebrated the 25th anniversary of her surgery with a trip to Yosemite National Park and a short cruise to Mexico.

It is similar to √©raic in Ireland and the Anglo- Saxon weregild. The compensation depended on the status of the victim, but could also be affected by the circumstances of the killing, for example a killing from ambush or by poison meant the payment of double galanas. The payment was due from relatives as distant as the fifth cousins of the killer, with each degree of relationship paying double the rate of the next, for example first cousins of the killer paid double the sum payable by second cousins. Women paid half the rate of payment by men. The first third of the galanas falls on the homicide, his father and mother and brothers and sisters. The remainder is shared between the kindred, with two thirds falling on the father's kindred and one third on the mother's kindred. The same rules applied to the receipt of galanas.

The metals are concentrated at levels that are toxic to closely related species not adapted to growing on the metalliferous soils. Compared to non-hyperaccumulating species, hyperaccumulator roots extract the metal from the soil at a higher rate, transfer it more quickly to their shoots, and store large amounts in leaves and roots. The ability to hyperaccumulate toxic metals compared to related species has been shown to be due to differential gene expression and regulation of the same genes in both plants. Hyperaccumulating plants are of interest for their ability to extract metals from the soils of contaminated sites (phytoremediation) to return the ecosystem to a less toxic state. The plants also hold potential to be used to mine metals from soils with very high concentrations (phytomining) by growing the plants, then harvesting them for the metals in their tissues. The genetic advantage of hyperaccumulation of metals may be that the toxic levels of heavy metals in leaves deter herbivores or increase the toxicity of other anti-herbivory metabolites. Genetic basis Several gene families are involved in the processes of hyperaccumulation including upregulation of absorption and sequestration of heavy metal metals.Rascio, Nicoletta, and Flavia Navari-Izzo. \\"Heavy metal hyperaccumulating plants: how and why do they do it? And what makes them so interesting?.\\" Plant science 180.2 (2011): 169-181. These hyperaccumulation genes (HA genes) are found in over 450 plant species, including the model organisms Arabidopsis and Brassicaceae. The expression of such genes is used to determine whether a species is capable of hyperaccumulation. Expression of HA genes provides the plant with capacity to uptake and sequester metals such as As, Co, Fe, Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg, Se, Mn, Zn, Mo and Ni in 100‚Äì1000x the concentration found in sister species or populations.C. Pagliano, et al. Evidence for PSII-donor-side damage and photoinhibition induced by cadmium treatment on rice (Oryza sativa L.)J. Photochem. Photobiol. B: Biol., 84 (2006), pp. 70‚Äì78 The capacity for hyperaccumulation is dependent on two major factors: environmental exposure and expression of members of the ZIP gene family. Although experiments have shown that the hyperaccumulation is partially dependent on environmental exposure (i.e. only plants exposed to metal are observed with high concentrations of that metal), hyperaccumulation is ultimately dependent on the presence and upregulation of genes involved with that process. It has been shown that hyperaccumulation capacities can be inherited in Thlaspi caerulescens (Brassicaceae) and others. As there is a wide variety among hyperaccumulating species that span across different plant families, it is likely that HA genes were ecotypically selected for. In most hyperaccumulating plants, the main mechanism for metal transport are the proteins coded by genes in the ZIP family, however other families such as the HMA, MATE, YSL and MTP families have also been observed to be involved. The ZIP gene family is a novel, plant-specific gene family that encodes Cd, Mn, Fe and Zn transporters. The ZIP family plays a role in supplying Zn to metalloproteins.Poschenrieder C., Tolr√° R., Barcel√≥ J. (2006). Can metals defend plants against biotic stress? Trends Plant Sci. 11 288‚Äì295 In one study on Arabidopsis, it was found that the metallophyte Arabidopsis halleri expressed a member of the ZIP family that was not expressed in a non- metallophytic sister species. This gene was an iron regulated transporter (IRT-protein) that encoded several primary transporters involved with cellular uptake of cations above the concentration gradient. When this gene was transformed into yeast, hyperaccumulation was observed.Becher, Martina, et al. \\"Cross‚Äêspecies microarray transcript profiling reveals high constitutive expression of metal homeostasis genes in shoots of the zinc hyperaccumulator Arabidopsis halleri.\\" The Plant Journal 37.2 (2004): 251-268. This suggests that overexpression of ZIP family genes that encode cation transporters is a characteristic genetic feature of hyperaccumulation. Another gene family that has been observed ubiquitously in hyperaccumulators are the ZTP and ZNT families. A study on T. caerulescens identified the ZTP family as a plant specific family with high sequence similarity to other zinc transporter4. Both the ZTP and ZNT families, like the ZIP family, are zinc transporters.Persans, Michael W., Ken Nieman, and David E. Salt. \\"Functional activity and role of cation-efflux family members in Ni hyperaccumulation in Thlaspi goesingense.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 98.17 (2001): 9995-10000 It has been observed in hyperaccumulating species, that these genes, specifically ZNT1 and ZNT2 alleles are chronically overexpressed.Assun√ß√£o, A. G. L., et al. \\"Elevated expression of metal transporter genes in three accessions of the metal hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens.\\" Plant, Cell & Environment 24.2 (2001): 217-226. While the exact mechanism by which these genes facilitate hyperaccumulation is not yet characterized, expression patterns correlate heavily with individual hyperaccumulation capacity and metal exposure, suggesting these gene families play a regulatory role. As the presence and expression zinc transporter gene families are highly prevalent in hyperaccumulators, the capacity to accumulate a wide range of heavy metals is likely due to an inability of the zinc transporters to discriminate against certain metal ions. The response of the plants to hyperaccumulation of any metal also supports this theory as it has been observed that AhHMHA3 is expressed in hyperaccumulating individuals. AhHMHA3 has been identified to be expressed in response to and aid of Zn detoxification. In another study, using metallophytic and non-metallophytic Arabidopsis populations, back crosses indicated pleiotropy between Cd and Zn tolerances.Bert, V., Meerts, P., Saumitou-Laprade, P. et al. Plant and Soil (2003) 249: 9. doi:10.1023/A:1022580325301 This response suggests that plants are unable to detect specific metals, and that hyperaccumulation is likely a result of an overexpressed Zn transportation system.Pollard, A. J. and BAKER, A. J.M. (1996), Quantitative genetics of zinc hyperaccumulation in Thlaspi caerulescens. New Phytologist, 132: 113‚Äì118. doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.1996.tb04515.x The overall effect of these expression patterns has been hypothesized to assist in plant defense systems. In one hypothesis, \\"the elemental defense hypothesis\\", provided by Poschenrieder, it is suggested that the expression of these genes assist in antiherbivory or pathogen defenses by making tissues toxic to organisms attempting to feed on that plant. Another hypothesis, \\"the joint hypothesis\\", provided by Boyd, suggests that expression of these genes assists in systemic defense.Boyd R. S. (2012).

An example of this method might be the package tracking provided by shippers, such as Deutsche Post, Royal Mail, United Parcel Service, AirRoad, or FedEx.  Technology  An example of a generic RFID chip. Some produce traceability makers use matrix barcodes to record data on specific produce. The international standards organization EPCglobal under GS1 has ratified the EPC network standards (esp. the EPC information services EPCIS standard) which codify the syntax and semantics for supply chain events and the secure method for selectively sharing supply chain events with trading partners. These standards for Tracking and Tracing have been used in successful deployments in many industries and there are now a wide range of products that are certified as being compatible with these standards. In response to a growing number of recall incidents (food, pharmaceutical, toys, etc.), a wave of software, hardware, consulting and systems vendors have emerged over the last few years to offer a range of traceability solutions and tools for industry. Radio- frequency identification and barcodes are two common technology methods used to deliver traceability. RFID is synonymous with track-and-trace solutions, and has a critical role to play in supply chains. RFID is a code-carrying technology, and can be used in place of a barcode to enable non-line of sight- reading. Deployment of RFID was earlier inhibited by cost limitations but the usage is now increasing. Barcoding is a common and cost-effective method used to implement traceability at both the item and case-level. Variable data in a barcode or a numeric or alphanumeric code format can be applied to the packaging or label. The secure data can be used as a pointer to traceability information and can also correlate with production data such as time to market and product quality.Traceability: Giving every product an authentic identity, Package Printing, June 1, 2008 Packaging converters have a choice of three different classes of technology to print barcodes: *Inkjet (dot on demand or continuous) systems are capable of printing high resolution (300 dpi or higher for dot on demand) images at press speed (up to 1000fpm). These solutions can be deployed either on-press or off-line. *Laser marking can be employed to ablate a coating or to cause a color change in certain materials. The advantage of laser is fine detail and high speed for character printing, and no consumables. Not all substrates accept a laser mark, and certain colors (e.g. red) are not suitable for barcode reading. *Thermal transfer and direct thermal. For lower speed off-press applications, thermal transfer and direct thermal printers are ideal for printing variable data on labels. Consumers can access web sites to trace the origins of their purchased products or to find the status of shipments. Consumers can type a code found on an item into a search box at the tracing website and view information. This can also be done via a smartphone taking a picture of a 2D barcode and thereby opening up a website that verifies the product (i.e. product authentication).

The club was founded in 1998 as a result of a merger between two local clubs in the city, and competed in Ligue 2 after suffering relegation from Ligue 1 in the 2011‚Äì12 season. The club earned promotion back to Ligue 1 at the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. The club president is Olivier Delcourt. Dijon play its home matches at the Stade Gaston G√©rard. History The history of football in Dijon began in 1903 with the founding of Cercle La√Øque Dijonnais (Dijon Secular Club). The club's football section was set up in 1913. During World War II Cercle La√Øque Dijonnais was renamed Cercle Sportif Dijon (Dijon Sports Club) and merged with FC Dijon. The new club, called Cercle Sportif La√Øque Dijonnais (Dijon Secular Sports Club), joined Burgundy's regional Division Honneur at its creation in 1945. In spring 1960, the club won the Burgundy championship for the first time. After a spell in the top level amateur league from 1962, the club was coached by Pierre Danzelle and was able to field a stronger team, as shown by its winning the CFA Centre division in 1965. Refusing repeated proposals by the footballing authorities for the club to turn professional, Dijon's directors brought about the breakup of the team. The club was relegated to the Division d'Honneur in 1967. The club won promotion to Division 3 in 1974 with the help of Philippe Piat. In the late 1970s, meanwhile, several small clubs merged to form Dijon FC. This new club became the rivals of Cercle Sportif La√Øque Dijonnais in the Burgundian capital. During the 1980s Cercle was owned by Jean Claude Dubouil. For the first time in its history, the club played in Division 2 between 1987 and 1991. Despite some good results, however, the club declined both financially and in terms of performance. Meanwhile, the city's second club, Dijon FC, coached by Daniel Joseph, was promoted to the CFA, the same division as Cercle. =Formation (1998‚Äì2005)= In 1998, the two leading clubs of the city, the Cercle Sportif La√Øque Dijonnais and Dijon FC decided to merge to give Dijon a stronger club, which was named Dijon Football C√¥te-d'Or (DFCO). During its first season in CFA, DFCO's manager was No√´l Tosi. The club missed out on promotion in the last match of the season. No√´l Tosi was dismissed, and replaced by his deputy, Daniel Joseph. The following season, promotion was won in a match against Calais RUFC, again on the last day of the season. The same year DFCO beat Al√®s to win the French Amateur title, the club's first trophy. The following two seasons in National were difficult for the club. During the 2000‚Äì2001 season, the club narrowly escaped relegation. Following the departure of Daniel Joseph, his deputy Mario Relmy took over and again the team managed to avoid relegation. In 2002, Rudi Garcia arrived at Dijon, which turned professional in 2004. In his first season as coach, Garcia took Dijon briefly to the top of the National league before they finally finished 4th, three points away from promotion. In 2004 Dijon achieved a memorable run in the Coupe de France, beating Saint-√âtienne (L2), Lens (L1), Reims (L2) and Amiens (L2) before losing to Ch√¢teauroux (L2) in the semi-final. In the same year DFCO was promoted to Ligue 2. =Ligue 2 (2005‚Äì2011)= Promotion to Ligue 2 allowed the club to be separated into two entities: professional and amateur. Despite limited resources and poor infrastructure, DFCO achieved an impressive 4th place in its first season in Ligue 2. The club also achieved the exploit of beating Bordeaux in the 16th round of the Coupe de la Ligue. At the end of the 2005‚Äì2006 season, the club finished fifth. The club's aim was promotion to Ligue 1. During the 2006‚Äì2007 season, Dijon narrowly missed several opportunities to reach the podium, but finally finished 8th. June 2007 marked the end of an era as Rudi Garcia left to manage Le Mans. The new coach, Serge Romano, led the club to a top-three position during the season for the first time in the club's history, but after the club fell down the table Serge Romano was sacked in December 2007. He was replaced by Faruk Had≈æibegiƒá in January 2008 after Frederic Bompard briefly took charge as caretaker. The new coach then saved the club from relegation thanks to a draw on the last day of the season away to AC Ajaccio. The same year, the club reached the quarter finals of the Coupe de France for the first time, but lost to Amiens on 15 April 2008. The 2008‚Äì2009 season was marked by the arrival of the French international Eric Carri√®re. Despite his contribution, DFCO remained stuck in the lower half of the table, although they put themselves beyond relegation in April. In the Coupe de France Dijon lost against the Ligue 1 team Grenoble on penalties after a 1‚Äì1 draw. Following a dispute during the summer break in 2009 between President Bernard Gnecchi and the coach at the time, Faruk Had≈æibegiƒá, Gnecchi chose to appoint Patrice Carteron as the new coach. After a first season ended in mid-table, DFCO was promoted to Ligue 1 at the end of the 2010‚Äì2011 season for the first time in its history, thanks to finishing third in Ligue 2. =Ligue 1 (2011‚Äì2012) = Dijon played in Ligue 1 for the first time in its history during the 2011‚Äì2012 season. On 7 August 2011, the Burgundy club played its first top-flight match against Rennes at home, scoring its first goal and recording its first defeat (1‚Äì5). The following Saturday, DFCO lost to Toulouse 2‚Äì0. The club's first victory in Ligue 1 came at home on 20 August against Lorient (2‚Äì0). The club won a second match in Annecy against Evian Thonon-Gaillard (0‚Äì1), but then lost against Lyon at home in the next match (1‚Äì2). Dijon was 16th in the table at the winter break, and recorded a series of good results afterward, drawing with the future champions Montpellier (1‚Äì1), and beating Marseille (2‚Äì1) on 17 March 2012, but internal conflicts and poor performances by leading players such as Benjamin Corgnet and ex-Chelsea player Ga√´l Kakuta weighed heavily at the end of the season. After a win against SM Caen (2‚Äì0) on 25 March 2012, Dijon failed to win another match, losing six and drawing three. On 20 May 2012, on the last day of the season, Dijon lost heavily to Rennes (5‚Äì0) and were officially relegated to Ligue 2, accompanied by their local rivals, Auxerre. Conceding 63 goals in 38 games, Dijon had the worst defence in Ligue 1 during their first season in the top flight. Following the relegation, club president Bernard Gnecchi resigned and manager Patrice Carteron left the club. =Return to Ligue 2 (2012‚Äì2016)= The new president was Olivier Delcourt, while Olivier Dall'Oglio took over as coach. During the first season back in Ligue 2, the club finished 7th. On 22 April 2016, Dijon won promotion back to Ligue 1 finishing second on the table. =Ligue 1 (2016‚Äìpresent)= In Dijon's first season back in Ligue 1, they managed to survive relegation and finish 16th. In the 2017‚Äì18 Ligue 1 season, Dijon finished 11th, improving their club record of 16th, which they set last season. The 2017‚Äì18 campaign, which was only the club's third-ever top-flight season, saw them end on 48 points, 11 more than they managed last year. In the 2018‚Äì19 Ligue 1 season, Dijon finished in 18th place on the table and were required to play a two legged play off against Ligue 2 side RC Lens. After a 1‚Äì1 draw in the first leg, Dijon would win the second leg and the tie 3‚Äì1 after two goalkeeping blunders by Lens keeper J√©r√©my Vachoux cost his side a chance of promotion to Ligue 1 and ensured Dijon's survival.

The club's first logo featured Dijon's Guillaume Gate (Place Darcy) with an owl in the foreground. In the 2006 version the owl was shown in full flight, while the Guillaume Gate gave way to a plain red background, in line with the team's new home kit. The owl is shown opening its wings to represent V for victory. Between the wings appears \\"1998\\", the date of the club's foundation in its modern form, and at the top 'DFCO' and 'Dijon Football C√¥te d'Or'. The current logo is an updated version of 2006's, with the words 'Dijon Football C√¥te d'Or' having disappeared, leaving only 'DFCO' and '1998' written in white on the red background.

Tang Family Professor of Sociology of the Trinity College, Duke University. He is most notable for his research and writing on social networks and social capital. Biography Lin received his undergraduate degree from Tunghai University, Taiwan, in 1960; his M.A. from Syracuse University in 1963; and his doctorate degree from Michigan State University in 1966. He entered the sociology department at the University at Albany, SUNY in 1971, became a full professor there in 1976 and served as department chair from 1979 to 1982. In 1979, he established contacts with sociologists in the People's Republic of China and established an exchange program between Albany and Nankai University. He also helped organize the first U.S.-China doctoral program in sociology. In 1990 he took a position as sociology professor at Duke University, where he also served as Director of the Asian-Pacific Studies Institute. A former Vice President of the American Sociological Association, he has also taught at Johns Hopkins University. He has worked in the United States, Central America, Haiti, and China (both mainland and Taiwan). Research Lin's research interest lies in social networks, social support and social capital. He has contributed theory, devised measurements and conducted empirical research in each of these areas. He has applied the theory and measurements to the study of social stratification and mobility, stress and coping, and individual, organization and community well-being. Lin has employed both quantitative methods‚Äîsuch as large-scale national surveys, and surveys in organizations and communities‚Äîand qualitative methods, such as intensive long-term observations in villages, for example. Having written about social networks since the early 1980s, Lin contributed to the economically-oriented branch of the literature on social capital defined by Mark Granovetter and James Coleman, seeking to establish a research paradigm which integrates theory with empirical testing. His definition of social capital as access to resources through network ties is one of the most widely accepted conceptualizations of the term. This definition of social capital is quantifiable and widely held to be more precise than the one popularized by Robert Putnam. Lin also rejects Putnam's thesis, put forward in Bowling Alone, that social capital is decreasing; he maintains that it is, in fact, on the ascent thanks to increasingly pervasive online networking. Honors and awards Lin is an academician at the Academia Sinica, Taiwan. He delivered the Fei Xiao-tong Memorial Lecture at Peking University in 2008, was honored the same year at the ‚ÄúRe-construction and Development of Sociology in China and Nan Lin‚Äôs Intellectual Thoughts‚Äù at Tsinghua University, and gave the Famous Foreign Lectures at the Interuniversity Center for Social Science Theory and Methodology at the University of Groningen in 2006. He holds an honorary doctorate degree from the National Chengchi University and distinguished visiting or honorary professorships at many Chinese universities and institutes, including Nankai University, Renmin University, Fudan University, Peking University, Academia Sinica, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Jilin University, Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences and Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Lin received the Distinguished Research Contribution Award by the International Association of Chinese Management Research in 2010.

It reveals the alleles an individual has inherited from their parents. Traditionally genotyping is the use of DNA sequences to define biological populations by use of molecular tools. It does not usually involve defining the genes of an individual. Current methods of genotyping include restriction fragment length polymorphism identification (RFLPI) of genomic DNA, random amplified polymorphic detection (RAPD) of genomic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism detection (AFLPD), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing, allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes, and hybridization to DNA microarrays or beads. Genotyping is important in research of genes and gene variants associated with disease. Due to current technological limitations, almost all genotyping is partial. That is, only a small fraction of an individual‚Äôs genotype is determined, such as with (epi)GBS (Genotyping by sequencing) or RADseq. New mass-sequencing technologies promise to provide whole-genome genotyping (or whole genome sequencing) in the future. Genotyping applies to a broad range of individuals, including microorganisms. For example, viruses and bacteria can be genotyped. Genotyping in this context may help in controlling the spreading of pathogens, by tracing the origin of outbreaks. This area is often referred to as molecular epidemiology or forensic microbiology. Humans can also be genotyped. For example, when testing fatherhood or motherhood, scientists typically only need to examine 10 or 20 genomic regions (like single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs)), which represent a tiny fraction of the human genome. When genotyping transgenic organisms, a single genomic region may be all that needs to be examined to determine the genotype. A single PCR assay is typically enough to genotype a transgenic mouse; the mouse is the mammalian model of choice for much of medical research today.

Born in Warsaw, he was a nephew of the famous Yiddish actress Ester Rachel Kami≈Ñska and cousin of Ida Kaminska and Josef Kaminsky. He studied with Leopold Auer at the St. Petersburg Conservatory (1905-1909) where he received his diploma. 1913 he continued his studies with Martin Pierre Marsick at the Conservatoire de Paris. Back in Warsaw, he founded and led a chamber orchestra specialised on music of the Vienna Classic (1915 to 1920). In the 1920s and 1930s he taught violin, viola, and chamber music at the New Vienna Conservatory (Neues Wiener Konservatorium), where he coached several groups including the Galimir String Quartet (led by Felix Galimir). In 1930 he founded the Pullman Ensemble, consisting of 17 string players (4 string quartets with a double-bass), of which the specialty was their performance of Beethoven's Gro√üe Fuge Op. 133 and String Quartet in C# minor Op. 131. Later, 10 windplayers were added to form the Pullman Orchestra, which performed regularly in Vienna and throughout Europe until 1938, when Pullman was able to escape to Paris. According to his students and colleagues, Pullman was a visionary musician; his desire for a kind of revelatory ensemble playing led him to make use of the widest possible range of string tone, to demand a perfect legato, and to search out highly unorthodox fingerings to match his conceptions of phrasing. Rehearsals were intense and long -- however, they functioned as rolling all-day affairs where members came and went as their schedules permitted. Through his pupils Felix Galimir, Richard Goldner, and others, his ideas influenced the training of generations of chamber music performers in the U. S., Australia (Musica Viva Australia), and elsewhere. In August 1939, he visited Warsaw, Poland, in an attempt to sell a house belonging to his wife, and was trapped there by the German invasion. Imprisoned in the Warsaw Ghetto, he directed (beneath the orchestra founders Marian Neuteich and Adam Furmanski) the Warsaw Ghetto Symphony Orchestra, which included among notable musicians, Ludwik Holcman. The band performed frequently from 1940-1942. Pullman was transported to Treblinka extermination camp in early August 1942, and like him all of the members of the orchestra were presumed to have been killed.

Prelude Victor began his southern drive with the objective of destroying the Army of Estremadura, commanded by General Cuesta, who was retreating in face of the French advance. On the 27th of March, Cuesta was reinforced with 7,000 troops and decided to meet the French in battle rather than continue to withdraw. The battlefield was just southeast of the town of Medell√≠n, roughly 300 km southwest of Madrid. The Guadiana River ran along a west-east axis in the northern edge of the battlefield, joined with the Hortiga River, which ran along a north‚Äìsouth axis that precluded any Spanish flanking maneuvers on the French right. Victor had roughly 17,500 troops while Cuesta possessed about 23,000. However, Victor had a 50-30 advantage in guns and could also count on more cavalry than the Spanish, 4,500 to 3,000. Both commanders arrayed their armies in an unusual fashion, although Victor's setup seems to have been more reasonable. The center of the French army, an infantry division under General Eugene-Casimir Villatte, occupied the main road that led from Medell√≠n to Don Benito in the southeast, whereas the wings, commanded by Lasalle (the left) and Latour-Maubourg (the right), stood much farther south and southeast. Each wing was composed of a cavalry division and two infantry battalions filled with German troops from the Confederation of the Rhine. Apparently, Victor's intentions were to keep withdrawing his flanks closer and closer to the center until a powerful counter-attack could shatter the Spanish lines. Victor's reserve was an infantry division under General Fran√ßois Ruffin, which would not take part in the battle. Victor's innovative scheme can be sharply contrasted with Cuesta's mistakes: Cuesta maintained no reserve and extended just 23,000 men, deployed in four ranks, into a four-mile arc from Guadiana to Hortiga. His plan was to simply strike the French wings and hope to catch the entire French army with their backs to Medell√≠n and the Guadiana River, which was exactly what Victor expected. The battle The cannonade began around 1 p.m. and Cuesta ordered the attack about an hour later. The Spanish initially had a great deal of success, repelling an impatient cavalry charge on their left flank by a brigade of Latour-Maoubourg's dragoons and prompting both French wings to keep falling back, all while their skirmishers unleashed deadly fire into the French ranks. Lasalle's position was a bit dangerous, since the Guadiana at his back meant his 2,000 cavalry and 2,500 infantry could not fall back more than a mile. Three Spanish cavalry regiments hovered around the bank of the Guadiana and attempted to turn the French left, but Lasalle and his men held on to their tenuous positions. By this point in the battle, both French flanks had retreated far enough to be within easy supporting distance from Villatte's division. Latour-Maubourg's western sector was reinforced with the 94th Line infantry regiment and a battalion of grenadiers. The ten French guns in this part of the battlefield also stabilized the situation as they consistently outperformed their Spanish counterparts. Spanish infantry, however, kept pushing forward and created many problems for Latour-Maubourg's men, who were arrayed in squares to protect themselves against cavalry charges and consequently had limited firepower. As the Spanish threatened to capture the French guns, Latour-Maubourg ordered the dragoons to attack once more. This time, the charge succeeded. The French dragoons defeated three Spanish cavalry regiments, who fled the field and left their infantry isolated, prompting them to flee as well. Since Cuesta had no reserves, a breach of this magnitude was just about the worst that could happen to his fragile line. Events now unfolded quickly. Lasalle had been reinforced with seven infantry battalions from Villatte, and once he saw the Spanish routing to the west he too ordered a powerful counter-attack. The 2nd Hussars regiment, accompanied by a regiment of Chasseurs √† Cheval, smashed the Spanish cavalry, reformed, and charged at the once-again abandoned Spanish infantry in the eastern flank. Lasalle's fresh battalions also attacked frontally and French dragoons were now rolling over the center of the Spanish army, which attempted to flee in any way it could. Many were brutally killed in this chaotic retreat and Cuesta's army effectively ceased to exist. A large part of the Spanish army, mostly on the right flank, was totally encircled, with no room to move. The French gave no quarter to Spanish soldiers, standing or surrendering, and during the rest of day they killed all of prisoners taken. Entire units were totally annihilated, Spanish bodies covering large extensions of the field. Aftermath It had been a disastrous day for Cuesta, who nearly lost his life in the battle. Some estimations put the number of Spanish killed at 8,000 men, counting both battle and after battle killings, and about 2,000 captured, while the French only suffered about 1,000 casualties. However, during the next days the French undertakers buried 16,002 Spanish soldiers in mass graves. On top of that, the Spanish lost 20 of their 30 guns. It was Cuesta's second major defeat at the hand of the French after Medina del Rio Seco in 1808. The battle saw a successful start to the French conquest of Southern Spain.

Description The recreation area is managed by the Bureau of Land Management of the United States Department of the Interior. A portion of the northwest corner of the facility has been designated as The Rockwell Natural Area and is off limits to vehicles to preserve and shelter desert plants and animals. Although the entire recreation area is located within Juab County, the dune field (which covers an area of ), extends southwest into Millard County, nearly as far as the city of Delta. Geology The Little Sahara sand dunes are remnants of a large river delta formed by the Sevier River from about 12,500 to 20,000 years ago. The river emptied into ancient Lake Bonneville near the present day mouth of Leamington Canyon. After Lake Bonneville receded, winds transported the sand from the river delta to the current location. The dunes are still moving per year. One of the primary barriers to the sand movement are the Sand Hills, which are located entirely within the recreation area and substantially slow the movement of the blowing sand. The sand consists of quartz grains, with minor amounts of feldspar, biotite, calcite, garnet and magnetite. Recreation Little Sahara is one of the most popular locations in the state for all-terrain vehicle (ATV) riding. Riders can enjoy riding on of sand dunes, trails and sage brush flats. Within the Sand Hills is Sand Mountain, a wall of sand that challenges experienced riders and the most capable machines. Visitors also enjoy camping, hiking, mountain biking, photography, horseback riding, snowmobiling, stargazing, trail running, sand surfing, sand skiing/snowboarding, paragliding, and sand sledding. There are 255 improved campsites spread across four campgrounds with access to 40 toilets and two sources for potable water. Dispersed camping is common outside of the campground areas. A visitor center is open Thursday - Monday, and closed Tuesday and Wednesday from spring - fall. The recreation area sees the highest number of visitors over holiday weekends from spring to fall. Admission is $18/vehicle/night or $120 for an Annual Pass, or $60 for an Annual Pass for senior or persons with disabilities. Passes can be purchased at the visitor center, the BLM Fillmore Field Office, or the BLM Salt Lake Field Office. Day admission can be paid at the visitor center or at self-registration stations located on the entrance road or at the Rockwell area.

She designed the strange situation procedure to observe early emotional attachment between a child and its primary caregiver. A 2002 Review of General Psychology survey ranked Ainsworth as the 97th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Many of Ainsworth's studies are \\"cornerstones\\" of modern-day attachment theory. Life Mary Dinsmore Salter was born in Glendale, Ohio on December 1, 1913, the eldest of three daughters born to Mary and Charles Salter. Her father, who possessed a master's degree in history, worked at a manufacturing firm in Cincinnati and her mother, who was trained as a nurse, was a homemaker. Both her parents were graduates of Dickinson College who placed \\"high value on a good liberal arts education\\" and expected their children to have excellent academic achievements. In 1918, her father's manufacturing firm transferred him and the family moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where Salter would spend the rest of her childhood. Salter was a precocious child who thirsted for knowledge. She began reading by the age of three, and the family would once a week visit the local library where her mother would select appropriate books for her level. She was close with her father, who assumed the duties of tucking her in at night and singing to her, but did not have a warm relationship with her mother; Salter later stated that their relationship was marked by her mother's jealousy and interference with the bond she had with her father. Salter excelled in school, and decided to become a psychologist after reading William McDougall's book Character and the Conduct of Life (1926) at the age of 15. She began classes at the University of Toronto at the age of 16, where she was one of only five students to be admitted into the honors course in psychology. She completed coursework for her bachelor's degree in 1935, and decided to continue her education at the University of Toronto with the intention of earning her doctorate in psychology. She earned her master's degree in 1936 and her PhD was granted in 1939. Salter's dissertation was titled \\"An Evaluation of Adjustment Based on the Concept of Security\\". Her dissertation stated that \\"where family security is lacking, the individual is handicapped by the lack of a secure base from which to work.\\"Salter, 1940, p.45 After graduation, Salter stayed on at the University of Toronto as a teacher before joining the Canadian Women's Army Corps in 1942. While with the army, Salter began as an Army Examiner who interviewed and selected personnel in Kitchener, Ontario. Her duties included administering clinical evaluations and personnel assessment tests. Soon she was promoted as an Advisor to the Director of Personnel Selection of the Canadian Women's Army Corps, and reached the rank of Major in 1945. After victory in the war, Salter returned to Toronto to continue teaching personality psychology, conducted research, and worked with Klopfer on a revision of the Rorschach.Klopfer, B., Ainsworth, M. D., Klopfer, W. E., & Holt, R. R. (1954), Developments in the Rorschach technique (Vol. 1). Yonkers-on-Hudson, NY: World Book. She married Leonard Ainsworth, a graduate student in the Psychology department of University of Toronto, in 1950 and moved to London with him to allow him to finish his PhD at University College London. Although they divorced in 1960, the 10 years of accompanying Leonard to different places for his career gave Mary the opportunity to meet and work with many influential psychologists including John Bowlby, as well as the occasion when they moved to Kampala, Uganda where her first \\"mother-infant\\" observation was done. After many other academic positions, including a long tenure at Johns Hopkins University, she eventually settled at the University of Virginia in 1975, where she remained for the rest of her academic career until 1984. From then she became a professor emeritus and stayed active until the year of 1992. While working at Johns Hopkins, Ainsworth did not receive the proper treatment considering her skills and expertise, such as a proper salary she deserved considering her age, experience, and contribution to the job. She had to wait two years for an associate professor position even though her qualifications surpassed the job description. At the time, women had to eat in separate dining rooms than men, which ultimately meant women could not meet male head department members the \\"normal way\\". Ainsworth received many honors, including the G. Stanley Hall Award from APA for developmental psychology in 1984., the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Child Development in 1985 and the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association in 1989. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992. She died on March 21, 1999 at the age of eighty-five due to a stroke.BRETHERTON, I. (2004). AINSWORTH, Mary Dinsmore Salter, December 1, 1913-March 21, 1999. In Notable American women: Completing the twentieth century. Early work During graduate school, Mary studied under the mentorship of William E. Blatz. Blatz focused on studying what he referred to as \\"security theory.\\" This theory outlined Blatz's idea that different levels of dependence on parents meant different qualities of relationships with those parents, as well as, the quality of relationships with future partners. His tiers of dependence were labeled secure dependence, independent security, immature dependent security, and mature secure dependence. Blatz theorized that the more secure and mature that the interaction was between individuals, the more likely the relationship to be healthy and without insecurities. After leaving the Canadian Women's corps she returned to Toronto to continue teaching personality psychology and conduct research. She married Leonard Ainsworth in 1950 and moved to London with him to allow him to finish his graduate degree at University College. While in England, Ainsworth joined the research team of John Bowlby at the Tavistock Clinic, investigating the effects of maternal separation on child development. Comparison of disrupted mother-child bonds to normal mother-child relationship showed that a child's lack of a mother figure lead to \\"adverse development effects.\\" In 1954, she left the Tavistock Clinic to do research in Africa where she carried out her longitudinal field study of mother-infant interaction. She chose to examine a common weaning practice in the area, in which the child is sent away for several days to live with relatives and \\"forget the breast.\\" Ainsworth conducted detailed interviews with families from 6 villages surrounding Kampala, Uganda, but was originally met with a language barrier. In order to overcome this, she made a great effort to learn the language to the extent that she could carry out simple conversation. Through learning this, she developed an appreciation for the culture, and later said, \\"It is a pity that one cannot require field work in another society of every aspiring investigator of child development.\\"Bretherton, I. (2003). Mary Ainsworth: Insightful observer and courageous theoretician. Portraits of pioneers in psychology, 5, 317-331. Ainsworth's book from that field study, Infancy in Uganda, remains an exceptional and classic ethological study in the development of attachment and demonstrates that the process reflects specific universal characteristics that cross linguistic, cultural and geographic lines. Mary Ainsworth followed her husband when a position as a forensic psychologist brought him to Baltimore. She spoke on clinical psychology at The Johns Hopkins University. In 1958, she was given a permanent position as an associate professor of developmental psychology. During this time at Johns Hopkins, Ainsworth's professional relationship with John Bowlby grew. While he had previously been a mentor, they started working together as equal partners, exchanging paper drafts for comments and finding the time to meet on rare occasions, since he was still primarily in London. Bowlby gave Ainsworth a copy of his new paper \\"The Nature of the Child‚Äôs Tie to His Mother\\" for her comments and Ainsworth was able to provide Bowlby information on her studies of infant-mother attachment in Uganda. Ainsworth underwent a difficult divorce in 1960, but continued with her research. She had an opportunity to present the findings from her Uganda study at a Tavistock Mother-Infant Interaction Study Group in London. It was her first time publicly presenting results, and the reactions were not enthusiastic. The primary question that developmental psychologists brought up was her definition for \\"attachment.\\" Ainsworth was motivated by this and other questions to create a catalogue of behaviors like \\"crying when the mother left the room, following her, greeting her on return with smiling, vocalization, excited bouncing, reaching or approach behavior\\" that she could use to qualify attachment. Strange Situation In 1965, Ainsworth designed the Strange Situation Procedure as a way of assessing individual differences in attachment behaviour by evoking individual's reaction when encountering stress. The Strange Situation Procedure is divided into eight episodes, lasting for three minutes each.Davidson, J. (Director), & Davidson, F. (Producer). (2005). Mary Ainsworth: Attachment and the Growth of Love [Video file]. Davidson Films, Inc. Retrieved October 20, 2014, from Education in Video: Volume I. In the first episode, the infant and his or her caregiver enter into a pleasant laboratory setting, with many toys. After one minute, a person unknown to the infant enters the room and slowly tries to make acquaintance. The caregiver leaves the child with the stranger for three minutes; and then returns. The caregiver departs for a second time, leaving the child alone for three minutes; it is then the stranger who enters, and offers to comfort the infant. Finally, the caregiver returns, and is instructed to pick up the child. As the episodes increase the stress of the infant by increments, the observer can watch the infant's movement between behavioural systems: the interplay of exploration and attachment behaviour, in the presence and in the absence of the parent.Bretherton, I., & Ainsworth, M. D. S. (1974). \\"One-year-olds in the Strange Situation.\\" In M. Lewis & L. Rosenblum (Eds.), The Origins of Fear (pp. 134- 164), New York: Wiley. On the basis of their behaviors, the 26 children in Ainsworth's original Baltimore study were placed into one of three classifications. Each of these groups reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the caregiver, and implies different forms of communication, emotion regulation, and ways of responding to perceived threats. Despite the many findings from her Strange Situation experiment, there was also criticism. It was said to have too much emphasis on the mother and did not measure a general attachment style. It was said that Ainsworth's work was biased because the study was conducted with only middle class American families. Critics also believed the experiment was artificial and lacked ecological validity. =Anxious-Avoidant Insecure Attachment = A child with the anxious-avoidant insecure attachment style will avoid or ignore the caregiver ‚Äì showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The child will not explore very much regardless of who is there. There is not much emotional range regardless of who is in the room or if it is empty. Infants classified as anxious- avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell (1970) theorised that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants is in fact as a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.Sroufe, A. & Waters, E. (1977) Attachment as an Organizational Construct. Child Development, 48: 1184-1199 =Secure Attachment = A child who's securely attached to its mother will explore freely while the caregiver is present, using her as a 'safe base' from which to explore. The child will engage with the stranger when the caregiver is present, and will be visibly upset when the caregiver departs but happy to see the caregiver on his or her return. In the United States, about seventy percent of middle-class babies present secure attachment in this study.A sensitive mother creates a secure attachment : Mary Ainsworth (1913-1999). (2012). In Big ideas simply explained: The psychology book.Sroufe, L. A., & Waters, E. (1977). Attachment as an organizational construct. Child Development, 48, 1184-1199. =Anxious-Resistant Insecure Attachment= Children classified as Anxious-Ambivalent/Resistant (C) showed distress even before separation, and were clingy and difficult to comfort on the caregiver's return. They either showed signs of resentment in response to the absence (C1 subtype), or signs of helpless passivity (C2 subtype). In Ainsworth's original sample, all six C infants showed so much distress in the course of the episodes of the Strange Situation Procedure 'that observations had to be discontinued.'Ainsworth, M.D., Blehar, M, Waters, E, & Wall, S. (1978) Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, p. 167 One percent of infants had responded with high degree of passivity and inactivity in a situation of helpless settings.Carlson, V., Cicchetti, D., Barnett, D., Braunwald, K. (1989) Developmental Psychology, 25, p. 525-531 =Disorganized/Disoriented Attachment= A fourth category was added by Ainsworth's colleague Mary Main. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as 'open-ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished', as she worried that the D classification might be too encompassing and might subsume too many different forms of behaviourAinsworth, M. (1990). 'Epilogue' in Attachment in the Preschool Years, ed. M.T. Greenberg, D. Ciccheti & E.M. Cummings. Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press, pp.463-488. In contrast to infants in other categories classified by Mary Ainsworth, which possess a standard path of reaction while dealing with the stress of separation and reunion, type D infants appeared to possess no symptom of coping mechanism. In fact, these infants had mixed features such as \\"strong proximity seeking followed by strong avoidance or appeared dazed and disoriented upon reunion with their caretakers (or both).\\"Hertsgaard, L., Gunnar, M., Erickson, Martha, F. ; Nachmias, Melissa.(1995). Child Development[Peer Reviewed Journal],(4), p.1100(7) From Project STEEP, infants that were having Disorganized/Disoriented (Type D) tested of secreting higher cortisol concentrations in saliva than infants in the traditional (ABC) classifications. Results of this study demonstrates a model of stress reactivity that reflects how the various classification of traditional (ABC) behaviors become a factor that is affecting physiological stress responses.Hertsgaard (1995) Child Development[Peer Reviewed Journal], p.1100-06 Major works *Ainsworth, M. and Bowlby, J.

The screenplay was written by Michael Allin, Jerry Wilkes, and Oscar Williams. Hayes also scored the music for the soundtrack.Ignoring the Obvious By Bob Thomas. The Washington Post, Times Herald (1959-1973) [Washington, D.C] 26 Dec 1973: D13. The film was released by American International Pictures as a double feature with Foxy Brown. Synopsis Mack \\"Truck\\" Turner (Hayes) is a former professional football player who becomes a Los Angeles-based bounty hunter after an injury. Truck visits his girlfriend, Annie (Annazette Chase), who is in jail and wants to leave LA when released. Truck and his partner Jerry Barnes go to collect their bounty from Nate Dinwiddie, a bail bondsman, who refers them to Fogarty (Dick Miller), a bail bondsman after a pimp who skipped bail named Gator. The two visit Dorinda (Nichelle Nichols), who runs Gator's stable of prostitutes. Truck and Jerry wait for Gator to visit, and chase him, but Gator escapes. A tip from Truck's friend Duke (Scatman Crothers) allows them to locate Gator again, and kill Gator when he attempts to shoot Truck. Dorinda threatens Gator's former whores to keep them in line. Dorinda offers Gator's competing pimps a deal: whoever kills Truck gets to replace Gator while she runs the stable. The only pimp interested in the violence is Harvard Blue (Kotto). Truck survives several ambushes by Blue's goons. When Blue points out that Dorinda will not be able to deal with Truck, they agree to share the cost of getting rid of Truck, and Blue will take over more control of Gator's stable. Blue's men force Nate to call Truck and tell him that there is a big job. Truck does not feel sober enough after a night of partying, so he calls Jerry, who dies in Blue's ambush. Nate warns Truck of the hit out on him. Truck frames Annie for shoplifting, and the police arrest her. Truck visits Nate again in the hospital. Truck gives Nate Jerry's gun for protection, and then they shoot Blue's goons when they burst in. Blue flees, but Truck shoots him. Blue dies a few minutes later in the driver's seat of his car. Truck confronts Dorinda and more goons at her house, and kills her when she reaches for a gun. Truck makes up with Annie as she gets out of jail. All of his belongings are packed in the car, and he promises he will go away with her, right away, if she takes him back. They drive off together, leaving LA for good.

It was bought by Fred Weintraub who was in partnership with Larry Gordon. Chapman later recalled, \\"I remember going into the office and, with my usual insouciance? arrogance? announced that, in that case, I wasn‚Äôt going to do any freebie re-writes. The response? That‚Äôs OK. He doesn‚Äôt want you on the project anyway.... And then, it became a blaxloitation film ‚Ä¶ about pimps and whores, right?

Soundtrack The soundtrack for Truck Turner was composed by Isaac Hayes. Although many regard it as Shaft's equal in composition, the soundtrack never managed to reach the mass popularity of the Shaft soundtrack, mainly due to the financial decline of Stax Records and was originally released on a double record album on vinyl which are mostly found in the \\"bargain bins\\". However, in 1993, it was released in a double-CD album alongside Hayes' other lesser-known soundtrack for the movie Three Tough Guys and again released on its own CD in 2002. Some of the music score was used by filmmaker Quentin Tarantino in the Kill Bill series.

Overview = First Division = The last league championship before the creation of the Premier League was won by Leeds United who overhauled Manchester United thanks to the efforts of, among others, Gordon Strachan, Lee Chapman, David Batty, Gary Speed, Gary McAllister and Eric Cantona. After runners-up Manchester United came newly promoted Sheffield Wednesday. Defending champions Arsenal slipped to fourth place and were never a serious threat to retain their title. The previous season's runners-up Liverpool dropped to sixth, below Manchester City, in their first full season under the management of Graeme Souness. It was Liverpool's first finish outside the top two since 1981. Newly promoted West Ham United were relegated in bottom place, with another newly promoted side ‚Äì Notts County ‚Äì following days later. The last day of the season saw Luton Town lose their top flight status after ten seasons. = Second Division = John Lyall took Ipswich Town back to the First Division after a six-year absence. The Suffolk club were followed by runners-up Middlesbrough, but it was play-off winners Blackburn Rovers whose promotion made the biggest headlines. Bankrolled by millionaire chairman Jack Walker and managed by former Liverpool boss Kenny Dalglish, Rovers beat Leicester City 1‚Äì0 in the play-off final to end a 26-year absence from the top flight. The Second Division relegation places were occupied by Port Vale, Plymouth Argyle and Brighton & Hove Albion. Brighton had been losing finalists in the play-offs just twelve months before going down, but their fortunes had been ruined by financial problems and the loss of striker Mike Small to West Ham United in the 1991 close season. = Third Division = New manager Phil Holder guided Brentford to a surprise Third Division championship success, while Terry Cooper's Birmingham City occupied the runners-up spot. The play- offs were won by Chris Turner's Peterborough United. The Third Division relegation zone was occupied by Shrewsbury Town, Bury, Torquay United and Darlington. = Fourth Division = Burnley won the Fourth Division title and became the second team, after Wolverhampton Wanderers, to have been the champions of all four divisions of the Football League. Also going up were Rotherham United, Mansfield Town and play-off winners Blackpool. On 25 March 1992, Aldershot were declared bankrupt and obliged to resign from the Football League following a long battle to stay afloat ‚Äì their record was expunged. Carlisle United finished bottom, but there was no relegation from the league in the 1991-92 season. Conference champions Colchester United returned to the league after a two-year absence. = FA Cup = Liverpool's Graeme Souness compensated for a disappointing season in the league by winning the FA Cup. They beat Second Division underdogs Sunderland 2‚Äì0 in the final. = League Cup = Manchester United missed out on the league title but achieved success in the League Cup with a 1‚Äì0 triumph against Nottingham Forest in the final. League tables =First Division= This was the last season of the Football League First Division as the top division of English football before the creation of the FA Premier League. Leeds United and Manchester United fought a fierce duel for the title, with the leadership changing several times, before Leeds finally clinched the title. A key factor in their success was the new year arrival of French forward Eric Cantona, while a key factor in United's downfall was a shortage of goals in the second half of the season where they dropped points against several teams they had been widely expected to beat. Consolation for the unsuccessful title challenge at Old Trafford came in the shape of Football League Cup glory. Sheffield Wednesday's third-place finish was their highest for decades, while defending champions Arsenal finished fourth and suffered an early exit in the European Cup as well as a shock first hurdle exit from the FA Cup at the hands of Wrexham. Manchester City finished fifth for the second season in a row. Liverpool finished sixth but compensated for a disappointing league season by winning the FA Cup in their first full season under the management of Graeme Souness. Two young players who made a major impact in the First Division were Ryan Giggs of Manchester United (voted PFA Young Player of the Year) and Steve McManaman of Liverpool. FA Cup holders Tottenham Hotspur endured a disappointing season, finishing a lowly 15th in the league, their chances of further success not helped by the season-long absence of Paul Gascoigne through injury. Gascoigne's projected move to Lazio in Italy was finally confirmed at the season's end, when top scorer Gary Lineker followed Gascoigne out of the White Hart Lane exit door to finish his playing days in Japan. Newly promoted West Ham United and Notts County went straight back down, joined by a Luton Town side who had enjoyed a memorable 10-year run in the top flight. Coventry City narrowly avoided relegation after a decline in form during the final four months of the season after Terry Butcher was controversially sacked as manager in favour of Don Howe, who himself left in the close season to be replaced by Bobby Gould. Oldham Athletic survived in their first top flight season for nearly 70 years. =Second Division= The Second Division promotion race was an exciting one throughout the season, with the promise of extra wealth for the promoted clubs after the creation of the lucrative new FA Premier League was confirmed. The first team to secure promotion were champions Ipswich Town, who ended their six-year exile from the top flight. The second team to go up were Middlesbrough, who clinched runners-up spot on the final day. The final promotion place went to Blackburn Rovers, who had thrived since the takeover of the club by local millionaire Jack Walker the previous season, his masterstroke coming in the autumn of 1991 when he appointed Kenny Dalglish as manager and allowed him to spend millions on building a promotion winning team. Blackburn had entered the new year looking all set to go up automatically, but a run of bad results meant that they had to win their final game of the season to qualify for the playoffs. They finally won promotion with a Wembley win over Leicester City, who had now played at the famous stadium five times and lost each time. The Second Division promotion race had also seen a few unlikely contenders. Swindon Town, under the management of former England star Glenn Hoddle, had gone top of the table for the first time in their history in October, but an eighth-place finish was not enough for even a place in the playoffs. Southend United, playing at this level for the first time, briefly topped the table on Boxing Day, but eventually wallowed away to a mid table finish. Their brief lead of the table was at the expense of Cambridge United, another side hopeful of a unique third successive promotion, and unlike Southend the East Anglian side remained in the hunt right up to the end of the season, finishing fifth and qualifying for the playoffs, but a heavy defeat to Leicester City in the semi-finals ended their dreams of playing in the new Premier League. Sunderland failed to finish anywhere near the top of the Second Division but enjoyed a remarkable run to the final of the FA Cup, where they lost to Liverpool. =Third Division= Brentford, who had played in the Third and Fourth Divisions for most of the postwar era, clinched the Third Division title to secure a place in the new Division One. They were joined by runners-up Birmingham City, who finally escaped from this division at the third attempt, and playoff winners Peterborough United, who won a second successive promotion to secure second tier football for the very first time. West Bromwich Albion, playing in the Third Division for the first time, were in the promotion race throughout the season but eventually finished seventh to miss out on the playoffs. Bolton Wanderers, who had only missed out on promotion on goal difference a year earlier, could only manage a mid table finish and sacked manager Phil Neal after nearly seven years in charge. Newly promoted Darlington and Torquay United both suffered an instant relegation back to the league's basement division. They went down with Bury, who had been in the playoffs a year earlier, and a Shrewsbury Town side who had been in the Second Division three years earlier. =Fourth Division= Burnley sealed the Fourth Division title to end their seven-year spell in the league's basement division and become only the second team to win all four divisions of the English league. They were joined by newly relegated Rotherham United, Mansfield Town and playoff winners Blackpool. After spending several years struggling to stay afloat, Aldershot were declared bankrupt and obliged to resign from the league on 25 March 1992, having played 36 games in the Fourth Division - their record was expunged. Carlisle United finished bottom of the Fourth Division, but there was no relegation from the league this season due to the continued expansion of the Football League, although Colchester United's return to the league after two years would make them its 93rd member rather than its 94th due to the demise of Aldershot. However, there were doubts about the future of Maidstone United, who were struggling with huge debts and low crowds, after they were refused planning permission to build a new stadium on land they had bought in Maidstone. There were also problems with their tenancy of the Watling Street stadium in Dartford, which left them with the threat of being without a stadium for the 1992-93 season.  Events  =Premier League gets go-ahead= 1991‚Äì92 was the last season of the four-division Football League. For 1992‚Äì93, the First Division would become the breakaway FA Premier League, and the Football League would contain just three divisions. The new league was seen as the last chance to maintain interest in a sport which had been blighted in recent years by numerous incidents of hooliganism and images of decay at football grounds which had contributed to the Bradford Fire Disaster and the Hillsborough Disaster. =Leeds grab title a decade after relegation= Leeds United won the last-ever league championship after a decade of relegation and before the creation of the F.A Premier League, two years after returning to the top flight. Driving force in the title triumph was experienced midfielder Gordon Strachan, who helped Leeds overtake Strachan's former club Manchester United in the title race. =Dalglish makes comeback to deliver promised land to Blackburn= Blackburn Rovers, managed by former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish, won promotion to the new F.A Premier League to end a 26-year exile from the top flight of English football. Their triumph was sealed with a 1‚Äì0 win over Leicester City in the playoff final, thanks to a penalty from Mike Newell ‚Äì a former Leicester striker. =Aldershot go bust= Aldershot, who had been plagued with financial problems for two years, finally went out of business on 25 March. Their Fourth Division record was expunged and their place in the Football League was taken over by Colchester United for the 1992‚Äì93 season. A new club Aldershot Town was formed almost immediately, and joined the Third Division of the Isthmian League for the following season. =League Cup win at last for United= Manchester United won the League Cup for the first time in their history after Brian McClair scored the only goal of the game in a 1‚Äì0 win over Nottingham Forest at Wembley. It was some consolation for their failed title challenge. =Souness delivers Cup glory for Reds= Liverpool won the FA Cup for the fifth time in their first full season under the management of Graeme Souness, beating Second Division underdogs Sunderland 2‚Äì0 in the final at Wembley. Ian Rush set a new record for scoring in FA Cup Finals at Wembley with his 5th goal. =Burnley enter the history books= Burnley won the last ever Fourth Division championship to join Wolves as only the second English team to have been champions of all four divisions of the English league. It was Burnley's first successful season after a period of misery which had almost seen them relegated to the Conference in 1987. =The Owls make an impressive comeback= Newly promoted Sheffield Wednesday finished third in the league and qualified for the UEFA Cup, confounding suggestions that 37-year-old player-manager Trevor Francis was too inexperienced to keep the Owls in the top flight. =Euro final returns to Wembley= Wembley hosted the European Cup final for the first time in 14 years. Barcelona of Spain beat Sampdoria of Italy 1‚Äì0. =Keegan rescues Newcastle= Newcastle United sacked manager Ossie Ardiles, just 36 hours after he was told by chairman John Hall that his job was safe. Hall appointed former striker Kevin Keegan as manager in hope of staving off relegation from the Second Division ‚Äì and he succeeded.  Awards  In his last season at Tottenham Hotspur before joining Nagoya Grampus Eight of Japan, Gary Lineker was voted FWA Footballer of the Year after scoring 35 goals in all competitions during the 1991‚Äì92 season. The PFA Players' Player of the Year award went to Manchester United's central defender Gary Pallister. The PFA voted Manchester United's 18-year-old winger Ryan Giggs as Young Player of the Year, ahead of Steve McManaman, Nick Barmby and Giggs' United teammate, Lee Sharpe. Like Pallister, Giggs also picked up a League Cup winner's medal, but just missed out on the league title.  Successful managers  Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson brought the league championship trophy to Elland Road just two seasons after they gained promotion to the First Division. Manchester United's Alex Ferguson added another trophy to the Old Trafford boardroom, this time the club's first-ever League Cup. Graeme Souness marked his first full season as Liverpool manager with an FA Cup triumph. Trevor Francis had a successful first season as player-manager of Sheffield Wednesday, who finished third in the league and qualified for the UEFA Cup to end a 28-year absence from European competitions. John Lyall brought First Division football back to Ipswich Town for the first time since 1985‚Äì86. Kenny Dalglish put together an impressive squad to win promotion to the new FA Premier League for fallen giant Blackburn Rovers. Brian Little transformed Leicester City from relegation candidates the previous season into promotion contenders, reaching the play-off final in his first season in charge. Phil Holder had a successful first season in management by winning the Third Division title with Brentford. Chris Turner guided Peterborough United to a second successive promotion as they won the Third Division playoffs to claim a place in the second tier of the English league for the first time in their history. Jimmy Mullen won the last-ever Fourth Division title with Burnley, who joined Wolverhampton Wanderers in the distinction of having been champions of all four divisions of the English league. Roy McDonough steered Colchester United to title success in the Conference to return the club to the Football League after a two-year exile.

The idea posits that, in general, the most fit organisms instinctively behave according to some natural rule (often, these rules vary among and are specific to the species). Since every organism has some instinctive \\"law\\" it can follow to be the most reproductively successful, this very notion is a sort of law itself, true of all living beings: thus, the Law of Life. In his 1996 novel, The Story of B, Quinn writes, \\"A biologist would probably say what I'm calling the Law of Life is just a collection of evolutionarily stable strategies-- the universal set of such strategies, in fact.\\" Quinn points out that this is a physical law, like gravity, not a commandment like \\"thou shalt not kill\\" nor a legislative ruling like \\"pay taxes\\". As he puts it, the latter two are written where only man can read them (in books), and that they can be changed by a vote, while the Law of Life is written in the fabric of the universe and cannot be broken.

The game's technology is similar to that of Lunicus, released by Cyberflix one year prior, but this time employs a more detailed storyline and environment. In an opening sequence of the game, we see future New York City, which has fallen into horrible disrepair in the aftermath of global warming and rising sea levels and a bankrupt federal government. The premise of the story is that gangsters, neo-nazis, and various other thugs have acquired large stores of weapons (from the government) and have ransacked New York's store of cryogenically-frozen DNA of endangered species. The player's job as a bounty hunter is to retrieve them. Gameplay Before taking off in a fancy hovercraft, the player chooses a co-pilot who can navigate or fire weapons. selecting Nikki, Chablis, \\"Cheesestick\\" Limbaugh (supposedly descended from Rush, though he is black), Thrash, Lark or Dogstar. Each co-pilot is unique and may not be available for every level. The game's three difficult and lengthy levels are played in the player's hovercraft flying around the streets of New York. The opponents drive tanks or fly planes and insult the player frequently. The user can choose between one of several bands for theme music in each level. each band has a unique song per level. the bands include: x-static, deathkiller, pink flaand (a reference to Pink Floyd), and smoove da groove. The name \\"deathkiller\\" was coined at a trade show - two Japanese girls watched the demo and described it as \\"deathkiller\\". evidently there is no accurate translation from Japanese to English for that type of video game... Game control is rather complicated as the player can move up, down, left, right, and forward and backward. The player must also control weapons. Fortunately, the copilot can take care of one or more of these functions. Development Following the successful launch of its CD-ROM game Lunicus in April 1993, developer CyberFlix began to create Jump Raven with the DreamFactory development environment from the first title. At the time, CD-ROM games tended to run slowly, but DreamFactory was designed to allow an unusually high level of speed for the era. However, CyberFlix considered its projects to be \\"interactive movies\\" rather than games, according to Jack Neely of Metro Pulse, and DreamFactory placed an emphasis on storytelling. As with Lunicus, production of Jump Raven began in the basement of a log cabin owned by CyberFlix founder William Appleton. The game's development team was composed of four members: Appleton, creator of DreamFactory, who handled the game's programming; audio lead Scott Scheinbaum; artist Jamie Wicks; and screenwriter Andrew Nelson. The four had originally founded CyberFlix to create Lunicus, and the company was incorporated a month after its release, with the help of manager Erik Quist. Science Fiction and Fantasy Illustrator: Debbie Hughes was hired as a freelancer to create the \\"puppet characters\\" for the game. Hughes Illustrated over 14 characters that players interacted with in the game. CyberFlix demonstrated Jump Raven at the Macworld Expo later in 1993, to public acclaim, and impressed Paramount Interactive employees who were in attendance. As a result, CyberFlix received a \\"multi-million-dollar deal for it\\" from Paramount, Neely later wrote. The agreement, which the two companies closed by November 1993, contracted CyberFlix for three games. Reception Jump Ravens initial Macintosh release was a commercial success. Discussing the multimedia development scene in 1994, a writer for The New York Times called the game one of \\"the best-selling and most critically praised [multimedia] titles on the market\\", alongside Myst. Market research firm PC Data named it the fourth-best-selling Macintosh game of July 1994, and the platform's seventh-highest seller in September. By August, Jump Raven had reached sales of 50,000 units. Around the 28th of that month, another 50,000 units were shipped for Microsoft Windows. Erik Quist of CyberFlix expected the game to sell 100,000 units overall \\"by Christmas\\", Barbara Kantrowitz of Newsweek reported at the time. Sales of Jump Raven had reached close to the 100,000 mark by January 3. Christopher Breen of Computer Gaming World enjoyed Jump Ravens combat and \\"often very amusing\\" writing, and noted that \\"the game is darned fast for a CD-ROM\\". However, he criticized the \\"incredibly annoying\\" copilot voices and \\"inane dialogue\\", and considered its interface clumsy. He concluded, \\"Adequately addressing these issues might have made Jump Raven a great strategy/action adventure rather than just a good arcade game.\\" The game was reviewed in June 1995 in Dragon #218 by Paul Murphy in the \\"Eye of the Monitor\\" column. Murphy's review was negative, concluding \\"I don't care how good a game looks or sounds, how cool the animation and special-effects are, how easy it is to load or save: if it isn't any fun to play, it's a failure.\\" References External links *Official website via Internet Archive *Jump Raven at MobyGames 1994 video games Mac OS games Science fiction video games Video games developed in the United States Windows games ","title":"Jump Raven"},{"id":"4040371","text":"The WGC Screenwriting Awards (previously Canadian Screenwriting Awards} are administered by the Writers Guild of Canada, and are awarded to the best script for a feature film, television or radio project produced within the Guild's jurisdiction, written by a guild member in good standing, and broadcast or released in North America or screened at a Canadian film festival for the first time in the previous year.

He quickly made his way into the reserve side, but first team football was much harder to come by, his debut eventually coming in February 1953 against Rotherham United as a replacement for Malcolm Allison. His first five years as a professional saw him only make occasional appearances for the Hammers, although national service between 1952 and 1954 did not help. He started the 1957‚Äì58 season as first-choice in the centre of the West Ham defence, and remained there, missing only one game as West Ham won the Second Division title. On 18 November 1959, Brown made his only appearance for England, a 2‚Äì1 victory over Northern Ireland at Wembley. He was a member of the 1964 FA Cup winning side, and the following year was back at Wembley as part of the European Cup Winners' Cup winning side, playing alongside Bobby Moore. In May 1967, after receiving a testimonial from West Ham, he followed his friend John Bond to Torquay United for a fee of ¬£4000. He had played 386 league games and scored 4 goals. He played 42 league games for Torquay, scoring once, before moving to Southern League Hereford United, then managed by Welsh legend John Charles, in May 1969 for one final season as a player. Coaching and managerial career When John Bond was appointed manager of Bournemouth in 1970, Brown was appointed as his trainer (although many sources have later described him as assistant manager which was Reg Tyrrell), and in November 1973, Brown followed Bond to Norwich City, becoming assistant manager. In October 1980, Bond left to manage Manchester City and Brown took over the reins at Norwich, though was unable to stop them being relegated. The following season Norwich were promoted back to Division One at the first attempt. They won the League Cup in 1985, but were relegated at the end of the season, only to bounce back at the first attempt again the following season as Second Division champions. Their next season back in the top flight saw Brown lead his side to fifth place, then Norwich's highest ever final position. They even topped the league during the first half of the season, and proved to be the hardest side to beat in the First Division alongside champions Everton. The following season, Norwich started badly and by Christmas, Brown had been sacked. In addition to his success on the pitch at Norwich, he had displayed a great ability for spotting talent at lower league clubs and in the reserve sides of other top flight clubs. The likes of Dave Watson, Steve Bruce, Ian Crook, Mike Phelan and Bryan Gunn were all brought to the club by Brown in this fashion. Watson went on to enjoy league title and FA Cup glory at being sold to Everton in 1986. Bruce was sold to Manchester United immediately after Brown's sacking, and went on to lift a succession of trophies at Old Trafford. Phelan followed Bruce to Old Trafford and collected winner's medals in the league and cup competitions during the first four of his five seasons there. Crook spent a total of 11 seasons at Carrow Road and played a part in some of Norwich's great successes, while also enduring a relegation in 1995. Gunn, who was signed from Aberdeen a year before Brown's sacking, remained at Carrow Road until the end of his playing career in 1999, and would spend a total of 23 years at the club as a player, member of the coaching staff and finally serving a brief spell as manager. In December 1987, Brown took charge of Shrewsbury Town for one match in the Second Division, but decided against taking the job permanently and took time out of football instead. In July 1988 he was appointed manager of Plymouth Argyle, where one of his signings was his son Kenny Junior from Norwich City, who would later be sold to West Ham United for ¬£170,000. Brown was controversially sacked as Plymouth manager in February 1990, and decided to once more take time away from football. His spell in charge of Plymouth would prove to be his last managerial appointment. In 1994, he was approached by England manager Terry Venables to work part-time as a scout, a duty he has since also performed for Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan, whilst maintaining his business interest in the Lakenham Leisure Centre in Norwich. In February 2004 he was guest of honour at Carrow Road for the home game against West Ham to celebrate the opening of a new stand, when a special presentation was made to Brown to commemorate his 70th birthday.

InfoSpace changed its name to Blucora and NASDAQ symbol from INSP to BCOR on June 7, 2012. This event reflected the company's change as the owner of two online businesses, after its acquisition of TaxACT in January 2012, and distinguishes the parent company from its search business operating unit, which was called InfoSpace. Blucora's TaxACT subsidiary offers online tax preparation services. Founded in 1998 and made by 2nd Story Software, in the 2005 tax season, TaxACT became the first to offer free federal tax software and free e-file to all U.S. taxpayers.http://www.taxact.com/company/company_aboutus.asp History The company was founded as Infospace in March 1996 by Naveen Jain after he left Microsoft. The company started with six employees, and Jain served as CEO until 2000. InfoSpace provided content and services, such as phone directories, maps, games and information on the stock market, to websites and mobile device manufacturers. The company grew at low cost without funding using co-branding strategies. Rather than try to get traffic to an InfoSpace website, sites like Lycos, Excite and Playboy embedded Infospace's features and content into their site and added an InfoSpace icon to it. InfoSpace then earned money by taking a small percentage of licensing, subscription or advertising fees. On December 15, 1998, InfoSpace went public, raising $75 million in the offering.A Fine IPO for InfoSpace from Wired By April 2000, InfoSpace was working with 1,500 websites, 60 content providers and 20 telecommunications companies. InfoSpace was praised by Wall Street analysts and at its peak its market cap was $31 billion. It became the largest internet business in the American Northwest. InfoSpace may have contributed to the inflated expectations in internet companies during the height of the dot-com bubble. In July 2000, InfoSpace acquired Go2Net. After the merger, Go2Net CEO Russell Horowitz became president of Infospace.InfoSpace to buy Go2Net to expand content delivery The same year, InfoSpace used a controversial accounting method to report $46 million in profits when in fact it had lost $282 million. Company executives skirted SEC trading restrictions to sell large blocks of their personal stock. Jain resumed the role of CEO in 2001, but was forced out by InfoSpace's board as chairman and CEO in December 2002. By June 2002, the company's stock price, which reached $1,305 in March 2000,The two faces of InfoSpace, 1998‚Äì2001 had dropped to $2.67. In December 2002, Jim Voelker took over Naveen Jain's role as Chairman, CEO and President of InfoSpace. Voelker quickly shut down or sold many of InfoSpace's 12 businesses, and focused on five core segments. In 2003, InfoSpace acquired Moviso from Vivendi Universal Net USA. In early March 2003, InfoSpace sued Jain for allegedly violating non-compete agreements in his role at newly founded Intelius. In April 2003, Jain resigned from the InfoSpace board. In 2004, InfoSpace acquired online yellow pages service Switchboard. It also moved into the mobile games space, acquiring Atlas Mobile, IOMO and Elkware. InfoSpace reported $249 million in revenue that year, up 89 percent from the previous year and more than Jain ever achieved in the company's dot-com heyday. In 2007, InfoSpace sold Atlas Mobile studio to Twistbox, Moviso to mobile content tech firm FunMobility, and IOMO re-emerged as FinBlade. InfoSpace's directory services were acquired by Idearc for $225 million in September 2007, while the remaining portions of InfoSpace Mobile were acquired by Motricity for $135 million in October 2007. In February 2009, Jim Voelker retired as CEO and president but remained on the company's board as chairman. From February 2009 to November 2010, Will Lansing served as president and CEO of InfoSpace. Under Lansing's leadership, InfoSpace started an online auction website called haggle.com. A year later, it shut down the website and sold its assets to BigDeal.com. William J. Ruckelshaus was appointed CEO in November 2010 after serving as a board member since May 2007. In January 2012, the company acquired TaxAct, and to help differentiate its name from its new purchase, and that of its InfoSpace search unit, it rebranded its name to Blucora, and its NASDAQ ticker symbol changed to BCOR on June 7, 2012. On August 1, 2013, Blucora bought Monoprice for $180 million, in an all-cash transaction. On April 21, 2014, Discovery Communications announced that they had sold HowStuffWorks to Blucora for $45 million. On April 4, 2016, John S. Clendening was appointed CEO of Blucora. In July 2016, Blucora announced the sale of its Infospace business, including HowStuffWorks, to OpenMail for $45 million in cash. As part of the deal, CEO Bill Ruckelshaus was replaced by John Clendening. On November 15, 2016, Blucora said it would move its headquarters from Bellevue, Washington, to Irving, Texas. At the same time, the company announced the sale of Monoprice, its online electronics retail business, to Taiwan-based electronics company YFC-BonEagle for $40 million. In January 2020, Blucora announced Chris Walters would replace John Clendening as President and CEO.  Shareholder lawsuit  In a shareholder lawsuit filed in 2003, a lower court federal judge ruled that former InfoSpace CEO, Naveen Jain, had purchased shares of Infospace in violation of six month short swing insider trading rules, and issued a $247 million judgment against him, the largest award of its kind at that time. Jain appealed the ruling in 2005, and settled the case for $105 million, while denying liability.

Mappila songs have a distinct cultural identity, while at the same time remain closely linked to the cultural practices of Kerala. The songs often use words from Persian, Hindustani, and Tamil, apart from Arabic and Malayalam, but the grammatical syntax is always based in Malayalam. They deal with themes such as religion, love, satire, and heroism, and are often sung at occasions of birth, marriage, and death.

Thereafter a large number of literary materials were produced in this medium; one authority has calculated that of these more than 1600 items, complete or fragmentary, were known by 1976.Pg 288-289, Mappila Muslims of Kerala: a study in Islamic trends, Roland E. Miller,Orient Longman, 1992 Over the centuries, various types of Mappila Pattu were composed, in accordance with the religious and political surroundings in the lives of the Mappilas of Malabar. The early centuries were primarily based on devotional works, while the colonial era was marked by the battle song genre called Padappattu. Various other categories also grew during the centuries with subjects ranging from romantic ballads and marriage songs to philosophical ideas, sea journeys and even flood ordeals. =Early works The earliest known dated works in Mappilappattu belong to the 17th century and primarily belonged to the Mala genre. Malappattu The mala genre of Mappila songs, generally written in Arabi-Malayalam script are praises of pious personalities of Islam who were supposed to have gained high spiritual status. Generally, though most such works were themed on the lives of Sufi saints (Auliya) . Most of these songs narrate \\"superhuman\\" deeds of these saints. The songs became popular in an era when Sufism gained a strong foothold amongst the Mappilas. Each Mala often corresponded to the leader of a Sufi order called Thareeqath, who was abundantly showered praises in the poetry, often well-exceeding the limits of human capabilities. Popular among these are the Muhyidheen Mala, the Rifa'i mala, the Shaduli Mala, the Ajmeer Mala, and the Nafeesath mala. Each of these corresponded to their respective Sufi orders while the last is about Nafeesathul Misriyya, a woman Sufi saint of Egypt more commonly known as Sayyida Nafeesa.Pg 25-27, Mappilappattu - Padhavum Padhanavum ( Mappila songs - Study and Lessons) - Balakrishnan Vallikkunnu and Dr. Umar Tharamel, D.C.

Examples of such songs include the Ibrahim Nabi Qissa and the Ibrahim Ibn Adham Kissa. Songs like the Kappappattu and Safalamaala by Shujayi Moidu MusaliyarPg 172, Kerala Muslims: a historical perspective - Asgharali Engineer, Ajanta Publications, 1995 conveyed ideological messages to the community in the era of post-Portuguese years when the identity and existence of the Mappilas were in a shattered state. ;Kunhayan Musaliyar Kunhayan Musaliyar lived in the early 18th century. He authored the popular works titled Nool Mad'h (1737 A.D.), Nool Mala(1785 A.D.) and Kappappattu.

The Kappappattu remained hugely popular for centuries, next only to the Muhyiddeen Mala. ;Umar Qadi Veliyankode Umar Qadi, (1757-1852) was a scholar, poet and freedom fighter from Veliyankode, near Ponnani, well known for his tax non-cooperation movement against the British rule in the Malabar. He composed songs of various subjects, ranging from the Cheraman Perumal to Arabic grammar. Other poems of his criticized the wrongdoings of members of his own community. He also wrote many poems in Arabic.Pg 590-592, Journal of Kerala studies, Volume 6,University of Kerala., 1979 =19th century and early 20th century= The dawn of the 19th century saw the advent of British rule in the Malabar. The songs of this era are marked by the rising anti-British feelings in the Mappila society in the backdrop of the agrarian tenancy discontent against the British backed Jenmi landlords. Most of the songs of the era fall under the Padappattu ( battle songs) genre. Padappattu The first dated work in this genre was the Zaqqoom Padappattu dated 1836. This song was actually an Arabi-Malayalam translation of the Tamil work Zakkoon Padayppor composed by Varishay Mukiyudheen Poolavar of Madurai in 1686. Alim Umar Labba, a Mappila religious scholar from Kayalpattanam translated it into Arabi-Malayalam.Pg 49, Zaqqum Padappattu, Mappilappattu - Padhavum Padhanavum ( Mappila songs - Study and Lessons) - Balakrishnan Vallikkunnu and Dr. Umar Tharamel, D.C. Books, 2006 Many of the tunes (Ishals)of Zakoon Padayppor have been largely utilized by famous Arabi Malayalam poet, Moin Kutty Vaidyar, especially in his master piece work, Badre Padappattu. The songs of the Padapattu genre can be classified into four different types:Pg 47-48, Zaqqum Padappattu, Mappilappattu - Padhavum Padhanavum ( Mappila songs - Study and Lessons) - Balakrishnan Vallikkunnu and Dr. Umar Tharamel, D.C. Books, 2006 * Islamic folk tales : These songs have no relation to actual historic events but either from a folk tale, a legend or simply an imaginary story related to Islamic traditions. Songs of this category include the Zaqqum Padappattu and the Jinn Padappattu. The former is a story about an imaginary confrontation of King Zaqqum of Iraq and Prophet Muhammed of Arabia while the latter is story about the Jinns, the other creation parallel to human beings as taught by the Qur'an. * Islamic history : These songs narrated events from the early years of Islam, and in particular the early battles of Islam. The Badar padappattu, the Hunayn Padappattu and the Karbala padappattu are characteristic of this category. * Mappila history : Songs of this type typically narrated the heroic deeds of the Muslims of Kerala and eulogize the martyrs among them, especially in their battles against the Portuguese and British colonial powers and local Jenmi landlords. Typical among these are the Kotturpalli Mala,Pg 53,Islamic society on the South Asian frontier: the MƒÅppi·∏∑as of Malabar, 1498-1922, Stephen Frederic Dale,Clarendon Press, 1980 Moyinkutty Vaidyar's Malappuram Padappattu(1883) etc. and the Cherur Padappattu.Pg 171, Malabar Rebellion, 1921-1922,M. Gangadhara Menon, Vohra Publishers & Distributors, 1989 The first depicts the heroism of Veliyankode Kunhi Marakkar, a warrior who saves a 17-year-old Mappila girl from the hands of Portuguese kidnappers but is martyred at the end of the battle. The eulogy here is enhanced with the simultaneity of the character's death with his hour of marriage. The other two narrate stories of Mappila attacks on the British and the Jenmi landlords during the 19th century. The Cherur Padappattu, composed by two poets named Mammad Kutti and Muhyidheen in 1841, refers to a battle between Mappila rebels and the army of the East India Company. The rebels had assassinated Kaprat Krishna Panikkar, the adhikari of Tirurangadi and sought refuge in a deserted house. The soldiers later surround them and in the ensuing battle, seven Mappilas and 20 of the Company army lost their lives. The Cherur Padappattu narrates this story praising the \\"martyrs\\" amongst the Mappillas in this battle. * Fictional songs: These songs were about purely imaginary subjects. The elippada which narrates a 3-day imaginary battle between rats and cats based on a Panchatantra story falls under this category. The common feature of all these songs were their pattern of narration of the bravery of the heroes depicted. While the battle songs roused the feelings of the community against the authorities, this era also witnessed the popularization of romantic ballads like Moyinkutty Vaidyar's Badarul Muneer Husnul Jamal and Chettuvayi Pareekkutty's Soubhagya Sundari. One of the notable aspects of both these works were the age of the authors at the time of the composition; Vaidyar was said to have been 17 or (by some reports) 20 at the time and so was Pareekkutty.Pg 99 -110 Zaqqum Padappattu, Mappilappattu - Padhavum Padhanavum (Mappila songs - Study and Lessons) - Balakrishnan Vallikkunnu and Dr. Umar Tharamel, D.C. Books, 2006 Moyinkutty Vaidyar Mahakavi Moyinkutty Vaidyar Memorial Center for Studies and Research on Folk and Mappila Arts at the Vaidyar Smarakam, Kondotty, Malappuram, Kerala. Moyinkutty Vaidyar (1857-1891), often referred to as Mahakavi (great poet) is historically considered as one of the most renowned and authentic Mappila poets. Born into an Ayurvedic family in 1857 at Kondotti in Malappuram district, he was well versed in Sanskrit and Arabic.Pg 88, Malayalam literary survey: Volume 16, Issue 1 - Volume 17, Issue 4,Kƒìra·∏∑a SƒÅhitya AkkƒÅdami - 1994 At a very young age of seventeen, he composed the romantic epic Badarul Munir - Husnul Jamal (1872) . His later works were on totally different themes that were essentially war songs in nature. The Badar Padappattu and Malappuram Padappatt are the most popular songs of this genre. Shabvathul Badarul Kubra(1875), more popularly known as the Badar Padappattu is considered one of the finest compositions of Mappilappattu .Pg 56-65, Mappilappattu - Padhavum Padhanavum ( Mappila songs - Study and Lessons) - Balakrishnan Vallikkunnu and Dr. Umar Tharamel, D.C. Books, 2006 It narrates the tale of the Battle of Badr by Prophet Muhammed and his companions. The Malappuram Padappattu (1883), also known as the Madhinidhi Mala describes the undercurrents of peasant life and struggles in Malappuram in the 18th and 19th centuries.Pg 101, Journal of Kerala studies, Volume 6,University of Kerala., 1979Pg 43, Kerala Muslims: a historical perspective, Asgharali Engineer,Ajanta Publications, 1995Pg 193 Kerala District Gazetteers: Malappuram, Kerala (India), A. Sreedhara Menon,printed by the Superintendent of Govt. Presses The songs of Moyinkutty Vaidyar are distinguished by their depth of imagination, the beauty of the metaphors used, the creativity comparisons involved and the variety of their ishals (tunes/modes). Pulikkottil Hyder Pulikkottil Hyder, born in 1879 at Wandoor was a popular poet who composed short songs in Arabi-Malayalam on topics of common interest, often attacking social evils. His simple lyrics on ordinary life of the Mappilas defied the traditional patterns of Mappilappattu thus giving him the name \\" The Kunchan Nambiar of Mappilappattu\\". In Vellappokka Maala, he describes a heavy flood that affected all throughout the Malabar, Mysore and Travancore. The sufferings of common men in the flood are depicted beautifully using only ordinary Malayalam vocabulary. The Pulikkotil Hyder Smaraka Puraskaram, instituted by the Mahakavi Moyinkutty Vaidyar Smaraka Committee and given to personalities who have contributed to the art of Mappilappattu is named after him. The foundation for a memorial for the poet was laid in his hometown Wandoor by former Chief Minister of Kerala C.H. Mohammed Koya in April 1979, but the work has remained incomplete ever since. In 1979, the Mappila Kala Sahithya Vedi published a compilation of his works titled \\"Pulikkottil Krithikal\\".Pg 167, Mappila Muslims: a study on society and anti colonial struggles By Husain Ra·πádatha·πái, Other Books, Kozhikode 2007 Other poets ;Chakeeri Moyidin Kutty Chakeeri Moyidin Kutty of Cherur, near Vengara, authored his poetry on the Battle of Badr titled Ghazvath Badril Kubra (The great Battle of Badar)) in 1876, a year after Moyinkutty Vaidyar's Badar Padappattu. It began a fresh pattern in Mappilappattu where the poetry was in pure Malayalam language, unlike the earlier works that involved use of Arabic, Kannada and Tamil. The poem was also known as the Chakkeeri Badr, to distinguish it from the other works on the same subject by other poets.Pg 96, Mappilas of Malabar: studies in social and cultural history, S. M. Mohamed Koya, Sandhya Publications, Calicut University 1983 The work is said to have been modified a couple of times by the author himself. He also authored a Malayalam-Arabic-Sanskrit dictionary and is considered one of the major Mappila poets of the 19th century.Pg 492-493, A handbook of Kerala, Volume 2,T. Madhava Menon, International School of Dravidian Linguistics, International School of Dravidian Linguistics, 2002 ;Chettuvayi Pareekkutty (b. 1853) author of Futhuhussaman, Minhathul Bari, Soubhagya Sundari and Adi Ahaduna was another well-known poet of the era. He was well versed in Tamil, Sanskrit and classical music.Pg 53, Kerala and her culture:An introduction, Indian Historical Records Commission, Printed at the St. Joseph's Press for the Govt. of Kerala, 1971 Futhuhussaman is not an original work of Chettuvayi Pareekukutty. It was a translation of a Tamil work by same name. =1920s and later= The early 20th century witnessed the growing influence of Malayalam in the Mappilappattu genre. This period was characterized by the rise of theological reform movements and nationalist mobilization in the Malabar. Songs of the era also involved themes of Pan- Indian nationalism and the Independence movement against the British. The 1921 Malabar Rebellion gave birth to a large variety of songs of this genre. ;T Ubaid Born T Abdurahman (1908-1972) at Thalankara in Kasargode, T Ubaid was one of the greatest figures of Malayalam literature in the 20th century. He was well versed in English, Malayalam, Arabic, Urdu, Kannada, Sanskrit and Tamil. Often referred to as Mahakavi Ubaid, he was both a poet and a researcher of Mappilappattu, documenting a large collection of Mappila songs popular in the North Malabar through oral tradition. His historic speeches and rendering of hitherto unheard kissa pattukal at the Kozhikode Sahitya Parishath conference in 1947 and similar conferences drew attention of the intellectuals of Malayalam literature to the rich literary traditions of Mappilappattu.Pg 7, Mappilappattu - Padhavum Padhanavum ( Mappila songs - Study and Lessons) - Balakrishnan Vallikkunnu and Dr. Umar Tharamel, D.C. Books, 2006Pg 26, A survey of Malayalam literature, K. M. George,Asia Pub. House, 1968Pg 4416, The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature, Volume 5, Mohan Lal, Sahitya Akademi, 2006 ;S.A. Jameel S.A. Jameel is a poet widely associated to the kathu pattu (Letter songs) genre of Mappila songs. His most popular works remain the 1976 letter and reply duet Ethrayum bahumanappetta ente priya bharthavu vayikkuvan (Oh my dear respected husband) and Abu Dhabeelullorezhuthupetti (A letterbox in Abu Dhabi). The former is a wife's letter to her husband abroad in Abu Dhabi requesting his return, while the latter is the husband's reply to his wife. The poet, who had psychological counselling sessions with many of the womenfolk of Malabar living separated lives from their husbands in the Gulf, described the anguishes of separation as felt by the women in the first song. The lyrics of the song referred in particular to the sexual and emotional needs of the woman and generated both praise and controversy within the community. The second song, composed as the husband's reply was also based on his interactions with the diaspora Mappila community during his visits to the Middle East in the late 1970s. It described the hardships and emotional dilemma faced by the migrant workers separated from their families. The songs created a huge impact on the whole diaspora community across different religions at the time prompting many to leave their jobs and return to their homeland for good. Though the kathu pattu (songs in the form of letters) existed before the works of S.A. Jameel, it was his works that popularized the genre amongst the common people of the Malabar. Social context ; Religious teachings In the early years of Mappilappaattu, the songs were written with a specific purpose of educating the masses about the religious teachings of Islam. In an era that preceded the printing press, oral traditions played an important role in the religious education of the Mappilas, especially those who could not read or write. Some of the early songs written entirely for this purpose included the Aqeedath Mala, Niskaarapaattu, Naseehath Mala, Kombinte paattu, Liqa Mala, Amaliyyath Mala etc. ;Anti-colonial struggles In the context of the Mappila uprisings against the British rule in Malabar in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Pada pattu played an important role in rousing Mappila sentiments of the Mappila peasantry in their struggle. The contribution of these ballads was a vital factor in the growth of a collective consciousness of a heroic tradition amongst the Mappilas. After almost every uprising of the 19th and 20th centuries, songs eulogizing the heroism of the participants and idealizing their sacrifice were composed and propagated by Mappila bands which went around the countryside singing them. Ballads were also popularized through group singing at social and domestic functions.Pg 90, Against lord and state: religion and peasant uprisings in Malabar, 1836-1921,K. N. Panikkar, Oxford University Press, 1989 These war songs often contained vivid descriptions of carnal pleasures of paradise awaiting the \\"martyrs\\".Pg 18, 'Popular' movements and 'middle class' leadership in late colonial India: perspectives and problems of a 'history from below',Sumit Sarkar, Published for Centre for Studies in Social Sciences by K.P. Bagchi & Co., 1983 Prior to the launch of an attack, the rebels in aspiration of \\"martyrdom\\" used to recite the Mala pattu alongside other preparations.Pg 122,Islamic society on the South Asian frontier: the MƒÅppi·∏∑as of Malabar, 1498-1922, Stephen Frederic Dale,Clarendon Press, 1980 The struggle by the Mappilas against Portuguese invaders in the 16th century led by Mappila legends like Kunhali Marakkars were also a major theme of such songs.Pg 452, Asian journal of social science, Volume 35, Issues 1-5, Brill, 2007 Another popular theme in these songs were the battles of the early Muslims of Arabia which is evident in songs like Badar Padappattu, Uhad Padappattu, Hunain Padappattu, Makkan Fathahu and Khandaq Padappattu. The songs provoked the Mappila population against the British authorities to the extent that a large number of them including the publications of the Cherur Padappattu were confiscated and destroyed by the authorities.Pg 110, India- West Asia relations: understanding cultural interplays : festschrift in honour of Professor E.K.G. Nambiar, E. K. G. Nambiar, M. H. Ilias, P. J. Vincent, University of Calicut. Kunjali Marakkar Centre for West Asian Studies, New Century Publications,2007 These songs also provided an insight for historians into the thoughts and viewpoints of the rebels and have been used for authentic historic compilation. The songs on the Malappuram shahids provide the earliest description of an armed struggle between the Mappilas and the Jenmi landlord class in the pre-Mysore era.Pg 262,Islamic society on the South Asian frontier: the MƒÅppi·∏∑as of Malabar, 1498-1922, Stephen Frederic Dale,Clarendon Press, 1980 William Logan, refers to the Cherur Padappattu in the Malabar Manual while describing the incident. (Pg 560,Vol 1, Asian Educational Services, 2000). Roland Miller also quotes from this ballad in \\"Mappila Muslims of Kerala: a study in Islamic trends\\". (pg 119, Orient Longman, 1992.) The 1921 Malabar Rebellion also spawned a large amount of Mappila songs. Many of these songs describe the events at the Khilafat movement in Malabar and offer a view into the conditions in Malabar during the era. A song sung at a Khilafat meeting at Tirurangadi in 1921 described the aims of the Khilafat Movement in a mindset of complete harmony with the National movement led by Mahatma Gandhi: Munthiya Banduvay Hinduvum Muslimum (Hindus and Muslims have deep relations) Moulana showathum Doula Khilafathum (The nation of Khilafath that the Moulana shows us) Entri Vannavidham Mahatma Gandhi than sahitham (He brought it to us along with the great Gandhi) Ahmed Kutty composed the Malabar Lahala enna Khilafat Patt in 1925 describing the events of the rebellion. Even the prisoners of the rebellion like Tannirkode Ossankoya used to compose songs in their letters to their relatives. ;Marriage The Mailanchi Pattu, the Oppana Pattu and the Ammayi Pattu belong to the category of Mappila Pattukal dealing with love and marriage. They are sung in chorus in connection with marriage festivals, often accompanied by rhythmic clapping by women. ;Migration In the \\"Gulf boom\\" years of the 1970s and 80s, mass migration of workers from the Malabar to the oil- rich Gulf states of the Middle East resulted in households where the working men were often separated from their womenfolk and the only means of communication was the letter. This brought about a huge interest in the Kathu pattu (letter song) genre of Mappilappattu. The lyrics of these songs often connected closely to the lives of the migrant workers and their families and it popularized this genre of Mappilappattu.Nilavu pozhikkunna ishalukal - Tunes of the moonlight -Jyothish VR - Malayala Manorama - Women - Nostalgia - Women, Saturday, 20 November 2010 22:32 hrs IST ;Others Mappila songs occasionally did also narrate stories outside the Muslim community. One such ballad was called the Mappila Ramayana deals with the story of the Hindu mythological figure Sri Rama.Pg 193, Ramayana stories in modern South India: an anthology, Paula Richman, Indiana University Press, 2008 Female presence in Mappilappattu Mappila womenfolk feature prominently in the culture and literature of Mappilappattu in various ways. The presence of female poets in Mappilappattu literature long predated the first female presence in Malayalam literature. A large number of Mappila songs also had female subjects as their main theme. Songs of the Oppana genre typically described the beauty of a bride in colourful terms. The famous Badarul Muneer Husnul Jamal by Moyinkutty Vaidyar devotes a section to describe the beauty of the heroine named Husnul Jamal. Another popular subject of composition was the lives of the prominent women of the early years of Islam in Arabia. The popular ChandiraSundariMala by female poet PK Haleema narrated the marriage of the Aisha with Prophet Muhammed. Other songs by female poets like CH Kunhayisha, V Ayishakkutti etc. depicted sorrowfully the final moments of Khadija, wife of Prophet Muhammed and Fatima, his daughter. The famous Nafeesath Mala by Nalakath KunhiMoideen Kutty praises a woman named Nafeesa, who belonged to the lineage of the Prophet. It ends with a prayer for her well-being in the Hereafter. Other major female poets include Puthur Amina, Kundil Kunhamina, B Ayishakkutty and K Aminakkutty.Pg 21-22, and Pg 133-144 Mappilappattu - Padhavum Padhanavum ( Mappila songs - Study and Lessons) - Balakrishnan Vallikkunnu and Dr. Umar Tharamel, D.C. Books, 2006 Songs by male poets like the Mariyakkuttiyude Kath by Pulikkottil Hyder and the Dubai kathu pattu by S.A. Jameel also focussed on the emotional aspects of the life of the womenfolk in the Mappila community. Influence ;Mala songs and ordinary life The Mala songs were believed to inculcate a religious belief in those who recited and listened to them and were hence given a spiritual status corresponding to the works of Ezhuthachan and Cherusseri Namboothiri amongst the Hindu population of Malabar. Many were recited daily at Mappila homes. The Muhyidheen Mala was considered as a protection from all calamities while the Rifa'i Mala was chanted as a cure from burns and snake bites. Similarly, the Nafeesath Mala was prescribed for pregnant woman for an easy child birth. The importance accorded to the Mala songs was so high that their memorization was regarded as a qualification for a would-be bride. Songs of Moyinkutty Vaidyar used to be sung and explained to public audiences in what was known as Seera Parayana Sadassu (history recital sessions). These often lasted for many nights together and were a popular scene throughout the Malabar.Pg 36-40, Ishal Paithrukam, Quarterly Magazine of the Mahakavi Moyinkutty Vaidyar Memorial Center for Studies and Research on Folk and Mappila Arts (SCARF)Vol 1 The early 20th century witnessed the rise of reform movements within the Mappila community. They objected to the messages of the Mala songs citing their contradictions with many of the basic tenets of Islam, often referring to them as Khurafath. Occasionally though, they used same medium to spread their message. Examples of these included the Parishkara Mala and the Durachara Mala. ;Cinema and poetry The spirit of their themes and beauty of representation in the Mappila Paattukal have left a lasting impression on Malayalam poetry. Well-known poets like P. Krishna Kumar, P. Bhaskaran, and Vayalar Ramavarma have composed a great number of popular Mappila songs. Mappila songs have been popular in the Malayalam cinema ever since the success of the 1954 classic Kayalarikaathu vala erinjappol by K. Raghavan from the movie Neelakuyil. Other popular melodies include Oru kotta ponnundallo from the movie Kuttikuppayam and Palanu thenanu from Umma by M.S Baburaj. Some of the movies that prominently include songs of this genre are Mailanchi, Pathinalamravu, Ulpathi, Sammanam, Manya Maha Janangale, Sammelanam, 1921 and Marc Antony. ;Television \\"Mylanchi\\" is the most popular reality show by Asianet. The show is on the way to the fifth season named \\"Mylanchi Little Champions\\". \\"Pathinalam Ravu\\" by MediaOne has established as the most popular reality show in a short span of time. A show which upholds the traditional values of Mappila Pattu,\\"Pathinalam Ravu\\" is now going through its third edition. Patturumal is a popular reality show on Mappilapattu being aired on Kairali TV. Jai Hind TV channel has telecast a reality showy by name \\"Mappilapattukal\\". Personalities S. M. Koya noted for his genre of Malabar Mappila Pattukal has won the appreciation of and respected by of film music directors like K. Raghavan, M. S. Baburaj, and A. T. Ummer. In 1925, Gul Mohammed, father of veteran singer K.G. Sathar, recorded his voice in gramophone, which became the first gramophone record in Malayalam. The singer and composer V. M. Kutty made significant contribution to popularise the Mappila songs. He is credited with having performed Mappila songs on stage for the first time in 1957.Other respected names who composed Mappila songs are Punnayurkulam V Bapu, O. M. Karuvarakkundu and Mohar Munir. Songs written by P.T. Abdul Rahman and sung by S.V.Peer Muhammad were compiled in a book Pƒ´rmuhammad pƒÅ·π≠iya putiya MƒÅppi·∏∑appƒÅ·π≠·π≠uka·∏∑ (Songs sung by Pir Muhammad).

The Akademi awards distinguished personalities from the Mappilappattu field each year, and also provides fellowships for researchers in the field. The awards are named after popular figures in the field of Mappilappattu, like Gul Mohammed, K.K. Muhammed Abdul Kareem and Qadi Mohammed. The All Kerala Mappila Sangeetha Academy was established in 1992 and instituted the Mahakavi Moyinkutty Vaidyar Award and the M.S. Baburaj Award. It also holds annual arts festivals with emphasis on Mappila arts. Conclusion The literature of Mappila Songs represent the aspirations of the Mappila community, its frustrations, struggles, love and affection over the ages.Pg 310, Journal of Indian history, Volume 85,University of Kerala,2006 Litt√©rateur M.T. Vasudevan Nair once described Mappila songs as the \\"cultural fountains of a bygone age\\". Today, increasing \\"cacophony\\" trends in newer Mappila songs and the lack of poets with a sense of imagination have attracted criticism from many corners. A large number of songs released in the last decade under the label of Mappila Songs, have been criticized for deviating from the original nature of the folk idiom and tunes (Ishals), provoking a call for a preservation of the original identity of Mappila songs.

(Photograph provided courtesy of the ICTY) Manjaƒça camp (pronounced: Ma√±acha) was a prison campThe bridge betrayed: religion and genocide in Bosnia By Michael Anthony Sells, pg.16 which was located on mount Manjaƒça near the city of Banja Luka in northern Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War and the Croatian War of Independence from 1991 to 1995. The camp was founded by the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) and authorities of the Republika Srpska (RS) and was used to collect and confine thousands of male prisoners of Bosniak and Croat nationalities. The camp was shut down under international pressure in late 1993 but was reopened in October 1995. At that time it was estimated that a total of between 4,500 and 6,000 non-Serbs primarily from the Sanski Most and Banja Luka areas passed through the camp. When the camp was captured in 1995 by Bosnian authorities, some 85 corpses were found associated with killings at the camp. Some 1,000 people from the Sanski Most area who were deported to the Manjaƒça camp are still missing. In early 1996, both the former concentration camp and the neighbouring army camp were opened to IFOR personnel for inspection following the Dayton Agreement. Background The Manjaƒça camp began its operation during the 1991 Croatian War between JNA and Croatian forces. At that time numerous Croatian prisoners of war were held at the camp. With the start of Bosnian War in early 1992 the camp began to admit civilian predominantly Bosniak detainees. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross there were 3,737 prisoners held at Manjaƒça camp. Exact number of people held at this camp is somewhat of an uncertainty since detainees were continually transferred between other camps including Omarska camp, Trnopolje camp and Keraterm camp. The camp was the site of human rights abuses, namely the regular and systematic beatings and killings of detainees, resulting in indictments and convictions by the ICTY United Nations tribunal for former Yugoslavia.https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/sta-2ai011005e.htm Most reports indicate that the camp contained male prisoners of all ages but mostly between the ages of 18 and 60. However, there are allegations that in the early spring of 1992, a small number of women were held at the camp and raped. According to a report of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the administrators of this facility who were officials of the army of the RS, maintained that the prisoners were prisoners of war. However, other observers consider that most of them probably never bore arms, and were detained simply because their age and Bosniak ethnic origin made them potential combatants in the eyes of the Serbian authorities.https://www.un.org/icty/transe9/030305IT.htm In the detention facilities, many prisoners were killed, tortured, and subjected to other inhumane treatment by RS forces especially targeting prominent individuals, such as intellectual, professional, business, political and religious leaders. At a minimum, during the period from late May 1992 to early August 1992, hundreds of detainees, identities of many of whom are known, died. Almost all of the survivors were eventually forcibly transferred or deported from the area. The Judgment of the ICJ The International Court of Justice (ICJ) presented its judgment in Bosnian Genocide Case on 26 February 2007, in which it had examined atrocities committed in detention camps, including Manjaƒça, in relation to Article II (b) of the Genocide Convention. The Court stated in its judgment: Recent developments Some of the RS officials responsible for running the camp have since been indicted for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes including Milomir Stakiƒá and Stojan ≈Ωupljanin. Some have been convicted while others are still awaiting trials at the ICTY.

In 1839 he began his military career in the Caucasus, where, for his actions, he was made an officer in 1842. =North Caucasus= Before the war in Western Armenia in 1877, General Lazarian made his name in the northern Caucasus. He was assigned, like many officers, to fight in the Murid War in Dagestan against the Imam Shamil. Lazarian, unlike most officers, took the time to study and learn the Tatar language. It was a language that was known throughout the Caucasus region by the peasants, and hence foot soldiers. With this knowledge he was the first to enter into negotiations with the Muslim rebels and was the one to set up the plans for the peace processes. In 1840 he was involved in the arrest of Hadji Murad. His crowning achievement in this theater was the talks he held with the defeated Shamil, whom he led to choose peace and surrender to the governing forces in 1859. That diplomatic act made him a general after being bestowed military orders of the highest rank. =Russo-Turkish War= Eleven years after his career in Dagestan, he was called to duty on the Armenian soil against the Turks. Finally his skills would be used to save his historic homeland. When Lazarian first got to the area of the military conflict, his role was quiet limited compared to the likes of Count Loris-Melikov and General Arshak Ter-Gukasov. Nevertheless, when duty called upon the general during the strike upon the Aladzhin position, he showed great promise on his front when given the command of the most avant garde divisions in the army, which was the only wheel-transport between Arpachay and Kegacha. With the given forces Lazarian drew back the Turkish forces towards their main location at the Kars province, forces composed of 25 battalions that later laid down their arms to Lazarian. These actions certainly added more ribbons and medals on the chest of the Artsakh general. An even more memorable occurrence took place during the night of 5 November to the 6 November. Before the divisions marched upon the fortresses around Kars: Hafiz, Kanlyi, Chimon, Taynasm abd Arab-Tabi, Lazarian rode in front of the divisions screaming \\"Now, with God!\\" and throwing his military cap in the air and making a sign of the cross. After this successful storming of Kars on the fourth try, victory in the area was certain. =Turkmenistan= In 1879 he was sent to command the expedition that led to the Battle of Geok Tepe (1879). As the campaign was beginning he grew ill, insisted on accompanying the troops and died at Chat on August 14, 1879. He was replaced by Lomakin who made an incompetent attack and was defeated. On 14 August 1879 Lazarian died while on an expedition on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea.

He was the leading Slovene Impressionist painter, patron of arts and theoretician. Together with Matej Sternen, Matija Jama and Ivan Grohar, he is considered the pioneer of Slovene Impressionist painting.  Life  Rihard Jakopiƒç - Zima (Winter) Rihard Jakopiƒç was born in Krakovo, a suburb of Ljubljana, the capital of Carniola in the Austria‚ÄìHungary, now Slovenia. His father, Franc Jakopiƒç, was a well- situated tradesman with agricultural goods. His mother was Ne≈æa, n√©e Dol≈æan. Rihard was the youngest of eight children. Jakopiƒç studied at the intermediate secondary school from 1879‚Äì1887. After passing an entry exam, he attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, for a short time returned home due to an illness, and then resumed his studies in 1888. In 1889, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and in 1890, the A≈æbe Art School in Munich. Then he lived in Ljubljana, where he participated in the establishment of the Slovene Art Society, and after 1902 in ≈†kofja Loka. In 1903, he continued his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. Jakopiƒç returned to Ljubljana in 1906. He was one of the early members of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, founded in 1938. Jakopiƒç died at his home in Ljubljana at 1:45 pm on 21 April 1943 after a long and difficult illness. A wake was held at his residence at New Square () no. 2, and he was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery (now ≈Ωale Cemetery) on 23 April 1943 after a ceremony at 3:30 pm at Saint Joseph's Chapel.\\"Mojster slovenskih slikarjev akademik R.

In Ljubljana, Jakopiƒç established the Slovene School of Impressionist Drawing and Painting, the predecessor of the Academy of Fine Arts at the University of Ljubljana. He was an initiator for the foundation of the National Gallery of Slovenia. In 1908, he built a pavilion in Tivoli Park, based on plans by the architect Max Fabiani. The Jakopiƒç Pavilion became the central venue for art exhibitions in the Slovene Lands at the time. In 1962, due to the relocation of a railway line, it was demolished. Commemoration In 1965 a primary school in ≈†i≈°ka was named after him. Since 1969, the Jakopiƒç Award, the highest Slovenian award in fine arts, is presented annually. In 1970‚Äì72, a statue of Jakopiƒç by Bojan Kunaver was erected on the original site of the pavilion. In 1979, a new Jakopiƒç Gallery () opened at Slovene Street () in Ljubljana. After Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Jakopiƒç was portrayed by Rudi ≈†panzel on the 100 Slovenian tolar banknote, in circulation from October 1991 until the introduction of euro in January 2007.

Its largest community is Neah Bay. The Makah Tribe was also a whale hunting tribe. They especially hunted gray whale for its size and weight. Some times while hunting, they traveled 30,40, or 100 miles out to sea. The Makah in the early nineteenth century inhabited Cape Flattery, Washington. According to the Lewis and Clark expedition, they then numbered some 2,000. The Makah are the southernmost of the Wakashan linguistic group, and the only member of this family living within the current boundaries of the United States. Other bands are First Nations peoples on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Makah culture was fundamentally that of the Pacific Northwest Coast area. In 1855 they ceded all their lands to the United States except a small area on Cape Flattery that was set aside as a reservation. Today most of the 1,600 Makah in the United States live on the Makah Reservation; their main tribal income is from forestry.

Background In the 1920s, just as the early twilight of the British Empire was approaching, a slightly familiar battle was fought, in a slightly unusual terrain, Cinema. The American film industry had by the twenties already started to dominate the global film market, with American films eclipsing English films in most parts of the British Empire. In response to a number of demands being made by the British film industry for the setting up of quotas in favour of Empire films in the colonies, and as a result of increasing anxiety about the spread of the new technology of cinema in the colonies, the colonial government put together a high level committee, the Indian Cinematograph Committee (‚ÄúICC‚Äù) to enquire into the working of cinema and censorship in India. The report, and the evidence of the ICC which ran into five volumes, and thousands of pages of oral and written testimonies makes for a fascinating document, which has unfortunately been ignored in most debates on film censorship. At the British Imperial conference held in England in 1926, a number of the delegates raised questions about the adequacy of film censorship to deal with the problems posed by the exhibition of American films. They were, in part, responding to the complaints registered by the Federation of British Industries to the board of trade about what they considered to be a virtual monopoly enjoyed by American films within the empire. This trade organization had represented their case not merely as a matter of protecting British business interests, but also because American films were \\"detrimental to British prestige and prejudicial to the interests of the empire, especially in the dominions which contains large colored populations\\". In connection to these concerns, the imperial conference passed a resolution recommending that appropriate action be taken to combat the dominance of Hollywood's films by encouraging their production within the empire. In a very significant report prior to the ICC, it was advocated that ‚ÄúGreat Britain owes a duty to the dominions; the dominions to Great Britain and to each other; and India owes a duty first to herself....The film can as well display the ancient dignity of the Mahabharata as teach the Indian peasant the elements of hygiene and sanitation\\" It is important to remember that the nationalist movement which was on the rise, spurred on by a series of events including the formation of the Home Rule League, agitations against the Jalianwala Bagh massacre, etc. helped to create the conditions under which the British empire found itself in a slightly precarious and vulnerable phase, needing ways to retain the symbolic fiction of the might of empire. It is in this context, that claims were made of American films tarnishing the prestige of the Empire by portraying scenes of immorality, vice and violence. More particularly, because of the inability of the native to distinguish between different classes of white people, they tended to think of all of the portrayal as endemic to life in the west, and this degraded the image of white women in the eyes of the lustful native men. This is also a period marked by the uncertainty of the effect of cinema, and according to the British social Hygiene delegation that visited India between 1926-27 (just prior to the setting up of the ICC), cinema was the root cause of a large number of evils in India, They said that ‚Äúin every province that we visited the evil influence of cinema was cited by educationists and representative citizens as one of the major factors in lowering the standards of sex conduct and thereby tending to increase the dissemination of disease\\" An article published in The Westminster Gazette in 1921 was widely circulated amongst the provincial governments, and the article claimed that \\"one of the reasons for the hardly veiled contempt of the native Indian for us maybe found in the introduction and development of moving pictures in India ...imagine the effect of such films on the oriental mind. Like us, the Indian goes to see the movies, but he is not only impressed by the story of the film, but by the difference in dress, in customs and in morals. He sees our woman in the films in scanty garb. He marvels at our heavy infantile humour - his own is on a higher and more intellectual level; he forms his own opinions of our morals during the mighty unrolled dramas of unfaithful wives and unmoral husbands, our lightly broken promises, our dishonored laws. It is soaking into him all the time, and we cannot be surprised at the outwards expression of this absorption. It is difficult for the Britisher in India to keep up his dignity, and to extol, or to enforce moral laws which the natives sees lightly disregarded by the Britons themselves in the picture palace\\" Similarly, a 1920 report in Bioscope claimed that the main motivation of these regulations was \\"the fact that there have been numerous complaints that the films were being imported into India which hold up Europeans to ridicule and lowered the native estimation of the white woman\\" Similarly, Sir Hasketh Bell, a former colonial governor warned that ‚ÄúThe success of our government of subject races depends almost entirely on the degree of respect that we can inspire‚Äù The demands for the establishment of a Committee that would look into the ways in which censorship, and other protective measures that could be taken up to prevent the tarnishing of the might of the empire. The economic context, namely the trade rivalry that the British film industry was engaged through 1920s in a competitive film market, with film producers from the United States was always understated. The argument of the cultural invasion and corrosion by Hollywood, was linked centrally to the attempt by the British film industry to bolster what they saw as their national markets including the colonies. Priya Jaikumar terms this as the ‚Äúimagined audience‚Äù of Empire films, a project of both economic consolidation, as well as cultural hegemony. The ICC was established by an order of the Home department and it was directed to examine the following issues: 1\\\\. to examine the organization and principles of methods of the censorship of Cinematograph films in India 2\\\\. to survey the organization of Cinematograph films in the film producing industry in India 3\\\\. to consider whether it is desirable that steps should be taken to encourage the exhibition of films produced within the British empire generally and the production and exhibition of Indian films in particular and to make recommendations The Colonial authorities strategically ensured that there was adequate local representation, and made B.T. Rangachariah, a highly respected lawyer from Madras, the chairman of the Committee. They prepared a meticulous set of questions (which we shall consider in a bit), and sent 4325 copies of the questionnaire to a wide range of people, from the film industry, from government, education officials, various police officials, health officials, members of the censor boards, electricity officials and prominent public personalities including Mahatma Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, Dadasaheb Phalke etc. In other words, the colonial governmental machinery was put into motion to ensure that the study was comprehensive and thorough, covering all parts of the then British India from Lahore to Rangoon to Chennai to Delhi. They received 320 written testimonies and interviewed 353 witnessed, and of course with colonial anthropological precision the witnesses are divided into the communities that they represent (114 Europeans, 239 natives, 157 Hindus, 38 Muslims, 25 Parsis, 16 Burmese, 2 Sikhs, and 1 Christian). This question of the representation of communities is a very significant one, which we shall return to in the end, via Madhava Prasad‚Äôs work on the ICC report. In many ways, the ICC report was the first of its kind anywhere in the world, and certainly the most comprehensive study of the material conditions under which early cinema existed in India. The importance of the study, apart from its historical value in documenting cinema up to and during the twenties in India lies in the fact that this was an attempt by the state apparatus to actually create cinema as an object of colonial knowledge, to understand the way it worked, to classify its audience, to name the publicness of the institution, and finally to attempt to render it intelligible within a log of regulation. Priya Jaikumar states that ‚ÄúPerhaps more than any other event in the 1920s the ICC helped to establish persistent themes in ways that the cinema and its audiences in India have been understood , evaluated , criticized and described ever since‚Äù . An estimate of the success of the ICC report in setting the terms of the public and regulatory discourse around cinema is the fact that the definition of the cinematic effect that is relied on in K.A.Abbas‚Äôs case relies heavily on the account provided in the ICC report. The ICC report, along with another significant study of the era, Film in National Life also contributed towards the making of institutions like the British Film Institute. Ironically, in purely instrumental terms, the ICC report could be considered a failure since nothing came out of the recommendations of the study, and it ended up as yet another colonial report (apparently doomed for a nondescript existence in dusty shelves). Priya Jaikumar however argues that ‚Äúthe fact that the ICC interviews and final report ended up on a dusty government shelf might be a testimony to the ICC‚Äôs success. Its proposals went against the state‚Äôs initial intentions, thus forcing the state to consign the document to its filing system. While the interviews deal with the specific conditions of India‚Äôs film industry in the 1920s, they have a larger import that has not been realized in their limited analysis so far. Regulatory documents are an invaluable archival source because they give us insight into the dynamic nature of cultural change and power relations. Instead of limiting ourselves to a study of policy effects, a study of the debates and discourses surrounding policy allows us to reconceptualize it as a process of communication and contest, where representatives of a state and film industry arbitrate over their positions‚Äù Her argument is that in our reading of policy, we cannot treat policy processes as reactive to social context but as an intrinsic part of it, and ‚Äúthus consider regulatory discourses to be open to the kinds of analysis that postcolonial cultural critics have brought to bear on cinematic narratives and images‚Äù. One of the reasons for the instrumental failure of the ICC was the fact that its dual agenda of staging a moral panic around the bodies of white women, to set in place a system that would ensure economic quotas for Empire films etc. just did not work out as planned. This plan was dependent on the construction of an idea of native audiences, and their vulnerability to the new technology of cinema, but the committee constantly encountered an intelligibility problem of another sort while collecting their data. The resistance offered by the nascent film industry in India, the nationalist contempt for the crude contrivance of the colonial state, and an emerging confident claim by the colonial subjects upon the experience of modernity constantly frustrated the official plans of the ICC. While in one sense the ICC can be seen as yet another component of the colonial logic of governmentality, where it exercised power through a complex mode of rendering it into a process of knowledge by means of data collection, historiography, documentation, certification, and representation. Priya Jaikumar says that ‚ÄúIt is tempting to see the ICC interviews as part of a process where an industry was studied with the intention of transforming it into a field of state regulation. However, the attempt to collect information on the Indian film industry was disrupted by an internally discordant state agency and a resistant film industry. My account traces these challenges to the imperial state as a series of fractures between the British Indian state and the Indian film industry. Each disruption resulted in a reformulation of the state‚Äôs agenda as the government attempted to reauthorize the state‚Äôs role in relation to the Indian film industry on the grounds of morality‚Äù It would however be a terrible mistake, both historically and in terms of its relevance to the present for us to see the ICC report merely in terms of a prohibition. As argued in the introduction, the prohibition model yields little in terms of unraveling the complex dynamics of power. Instead we need to understand the ways in which the ICC set in place a system of regulation, which exists in different register, though inter connected. On the one hand, it looked at the question of the regulation of content, and this is the most straight forward censorship question, where the state determines what can or cannot be seen. This of course depends on a second order justification based on the alleged harm caused by certain images. In the case of the ICC, it was the tarnishing of the prestige of the empire. The content of what could or not be seen is also supplemented by the conditions under which acts of public spectatorship are rendered possible. This is made possible through detailed regulations about the spatial conditions of cinema, safety guidelines, electricity norms to be followed etc. Secondly it sets into place a system of regulating the entire industry itself as a whole, through taxation norms, through reformist agendas and policies to improve cinema etc., and finally through the staging of the pedagogic function of censorship, where censorship is not merely about prohibiting a particular view, but since the native actually does not know how to see, or what to see, censorship is also tied to the task of teaching the natives to see properly. This reformist agenda is described by Ashish Rajadhyaksha as the process of ‚Äúcreating a better cinema and worthy of incarnating the citizen as the filmgoing subject‚Äù The interlinked ideas of regulation, reform and education establishes the normative function of cinema and of censorship, and one of the challenges lies in ways in which we can read them not as they traditionally have been in isolated modes, but in a way that renders them a part of a larger project of mobilizing (to borrow from Saeed Mirza) a certain kind of cinema for a certain kind of state.

The entrances were originally covered by a large stone, which is usually still next to the entrance. Several of the larger tombs have a pillar in the center of the chamber. One tomb's walls are lined with stone benches cut directly from the rock.  Artifacts  Artifacts from the chamber tombs include seal stones, jewelry, bronze tools, stone vases, bronze vessels and pottery. Clay larnakes, a type of small coffin, painted with double axes, hunting scenes, and Horns of Consecration were also excavated. These artifacts can be found at the Archaeological Museum of Chania and the Rethymno Museum. Over 500 skeletons have been excavated, yielding useful information about the diet of the Minoan people in this area. They ate high carbohydrate diets but not much meat.

Early life The son of a bookbinder, Reinhardt was educated in Ilmenau through high school, studied trade and commerce, and worked in business in Germany and abroad. At the outbreak of World War I Reinhardt was in Riga, Livonia, and was interned by Russian forces. He ended up spending the war years in an internment camp in Siberia as an enemy alien, only returning to Germany in 1918. In 1919, he became the headmaster at the Thuringian Commercial School (Th√ºringische Handelsschule), and the head of the Academy for Economics and Taxation. From 1922, he worked as a tax administrator at the Thuringian State Finance Office. In 1924, he founded the first German Correspondence Trade School (Fernhandelschule) and became its Director. Nazi Party career Reinhardt was a member of the Deutsch-Volkischen Bund, a right- wing nationalist organization, and in 1923 he joined the Nazi Party before it was banned in the aftermath of the Beer Hall Putsch. Rejoining the newly refounded Party on 23 October 1925 (membership number 45,959) Reinhardt quickly established a career with his talent for speaking and his knowledge of economic and taxation systems. In 1926, he became the Local Group Leader (Ortsgruppenleiter) in Herrsching, in 1927 the District Leader (Bezirksleiter) in Upper Bavaria-South, and on 1 June 1928 he was named Gauleiter of Upper Bavaria-Swabia. On 1 October, the Gau was redesignated Upper Bavaria when Swabia became a separate Gau under Karl Wahl. In 1928 Reinhardt established the Correspondence Courses for Party Speakers at the Fernhandelschule. From 1929 to 1933, Reinhardt was the leader of the Rednerschule, the Nazi's official training school for Party speakers in Herrsching, and some 6000 party members eventually received propagandistic training there. In September 1930, Reinhardt became a member of the Reichstag for electoral constituency 24 (Upper Bavaria-Swabia). He took on the leading role in the NSDAP in financial issues, serving as the head of the Nazi Party faction on the budget committee and the Reich debt committee in the Reichstag. On 1 November 1930, he resigned as Gauleiter of Upper Bavaria due to his other increasing workloads and was succeeded by Adolf Wagner. From 27 April 1930 to 9 December 1932, Reinhardt was a department head in the Reichspropagandaleiter II office in the Party‚Äôs national leadership offices at the Brown House in Munich. From 1931 to June 1932 he also worked in the Reich Organization Department II on the staff of Deputy F√ºhrer Rudolf Hess. In these years, he served as the chief economic representative of the Party leadership as a member of its National Economic Council. In March 1933 he became the First Deputy Chairman of the Reichstag Budget Committee. Reinhardt was also a member of the Sturmabteilung, the Nazi paramilitary organization. In November 1933, he became an SA-Gruppenf√ºhrer. On 11 November 1937, he was promoted to SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer.  State Secretary  On 1 April 1933 after the Nazi assumption of power, and due to Adolf Hitler's intervention, Reinhardt became State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of Finance under Johann Ludwig Graf Schwerin von Krosigk succeeding Arthur Zarden, whose incumbency violated Nazi policy, as he was Jewish. Reinhardt would hold this powerful position right through to the end of the regime in 1945. From 1936 to 1942, he was also a member of the General Council of the Four Year Plan. Reinhardt could count on the Nazi Party's and Hitler's backing, which was why he held such an influential position from the outset. Reinhardt made the decisions as to taxation. Under him were the Tax and Customs School ‚Äì set up by him in 1935 ‚Äì and the Zollgrenzschutz (\\"Customs Service\\"). It was one of the components of the programs aimed at reducing unemployment, which collectively were also known as the Reinhardt Program. It is held by some, particularly German, historians that Reinhardt gave his name also to Operation Reinhard, although broader understanding especially after its termination has associated that program's name with Reinhard Heydrich, first head of the RSHA. The confusion stemmed from the fact that Heydrich had spelled his first name both Reinhard and Reinhardt throughout the 1930s during his career in the SS.https://archive.org/stream/TheOperationReinhardExterminationCamps/MicrosoftWord- Document1_djvu.txt Section 1 (¬ß1) of the Tax Reconciliation Act (Steueranpassungsgesetz) of October 1934 traces to Reinhardt. This law implemented the Nazi Weltanschauung. It obviated numerous, detailed changes to the individual regulations and implemented the Nazi ideology in one stroke. In the time that followed, a whole series of further regulations and decisions against Jews bore Reinhardt's signature, for instance, 1942's statement on stolen gold from dispossessed and murdered Jews. He was publisher of the Deutsche Steuerzeitung (\\"German Tax Newspaper\\") from 1934 to 1945 which, along with all his other publications, he made required reading for all finance officials.  Denazification  Reinhardt was captured by the Allies in May 1945, and on 17 June 1949 he was classified as a Hauptschuldiger (literally \\"main culprit\\") at a Denazification proceeding, and sentenced to four years in labour prison. In an appeal proceeding late in 1949, the sentence was upheld, but the penalty reduced to three years. By late 1950 the sentence was definitively confirmed, but Reinhardt's time in custody was to be counted towards his penalty, which led to his immediate release. In the court proceedings, Reinhardt defended himself as a financial expert who was limited to Reich finances, who mitigated penalties inflicted on Jews, and otherwise had to bend to other ministries' decisions.  Last years  Reinhardt worked as a tax adviser in West Germany, but otherwise was not to be seen in public life and died in 1969. His son Dr. Klaus Reinhardt became a general in the Bundeswehr.

The screenplay by Ketti Frings, based on an unpublished short story by Marty Holland, concerns a woman who pretends to fall in love with an assistant district attorney and uses him to acquit her of the murder of her elderly aunt. Plot Thelma Jordon shows up late one night in the office of the district attorney to report a series of attempted burglaries at her Aunt Vera's home. The district attorney is out but she meets the assistant district attorney, Cleve Marshall, a married man, who would rather get drunk than go home. He asks her to join him for a drink and she agrees. Before Cleve can stop himself, he and Thelma are involved in a love affair. But Thelma is a mysterious woman, and Cleve can't help wondering if she is hiding something. When her rich aunt is found shot to death, Thelma calls Cleve rather than the police, and he helps her cover up evidence that may incriminate her, but he believes her story that an intruder killed the aunt. When the district attorney arrests Thelma as the prime suspect, Cleve is in a unique position to help her due to his job. He arranges to prosecute the case and persuades the jury that a \\"reasonable doubt\\" exists due to evidence of an elusive \\"Mr X\\" (which he believes is Thelma's estranged husband). Thelma is acquitted. Her past, however, has begun to catch up with her. Tony, her husband, materialises again. She tells him she has successfully manipulated Cleve. She does not love him but he loves her. Their conversation reveals that it was Tony who conceived the scheme for Thelma to commit the murder and inherit Vera's jewels and money. Cleve comes to the house and Thelma acknowledges that there is a relationship with Tony. Tony hits Cleve over the head and knocks him out so the two can escape. Unable to deal with her guilty conscience, Thelma causes a car accident that results in her accomplice's death and her own fatal injury. As she lays dying, she confesses the truth to the district attorney. However, she does not incriminate Cleve, saying she cannot reveal his name because she loves him. The district attorney tells Cleve that he will be disbarred for his actions, and he knows he will also get divorced, but he walks away a free man.

Production The project was filmed and marketed under the title Thelma Jordon. It was the ninth film noir to be made by director Robert Siodmak. Principal photography took place between February 14 and March 29, 1949. Location filming was held at the Old Orange County Courthouse in Santa Ana, California, and at the Los Angeles County jail. Release Though the film carries a copyright date of August 1, 1949, it had its premiere in New York on January 18, 1950. It grossed $51.5 million in adjusted domestic box office receipts. Critical reception Variety praised the film, writing: \\"Thelma Jordon unfolds as an interesting, femme-slanted melodrama, told with a lot of restrained excitement. Scripting from a story by Marty Holland is very forthright, up to the contrived conclusion, and even that is carried off successfully because of the sympathy developed for the misguided and misused character played by Wendell Corey\\". Time Out gave the film 5 out of 5 stars, comparing it favorably to the classic film noir Double Indemnity in which Stanwyck also stars. It singles out Corey's performance as \\"the nondescript assistant DA she drives to the brink of destruction. The part is played (remarkably well) by Corey, whose haunted, hangdog persona as a perennial loser is echoed so perfectly by the deliberately slow, inexorable tempo of Siodmak's direction (not to mention George Barnes' superbly bleak lighting)\\". Radio Times also lauds the direction and Corey's performance as \\"a hapless assistant DA, played to meek perfection by Wendell Corey\\", and writes about Stanwyck: \\"In these thrillers Stanwyck has a terrific, deadly allure and the moody lighting and the music conspire with her, keeping the men fluttering around her like moths to a flame\\". The New York Times gave a mixed review, stating: \\"Thelma Jordon is, for all of its production polish, adult dialogue, and intelligent acting, a strangely halting and sometimes confusing work\\". The review criticized the slow pace of the film and the not-unexpected climax, but gave credit to Stanwyck for \\"handling a complex assignment professionally and with a minimum of forced histrionics\\".

It most commonly refers to expats living for an extended period of time in Japan, though it may also be used to describe persons living outside Japan who have a certain affinity to some aspect of Japanese culture. Cultural assimilation could include adoption of Japanese mannerisms, style of clothing, taste in entertainment, and sometimes aspects of Japanese language. In expats this process often occurs because of a feeling of isolation or desire to conform, whereas outside Japan it may occur because of an especially strong interest in some kind of fan culture based in Japan, e.g. anime, manga, television dramas, music or lolita fashion. Japanification in popular culture Japanese culture has had a strong influence on American popular culture dating back to Japan's defeat in World War II and to the early 1950s when children of the United States were first introduced to Japanese popular culture, such as Godzilla. The Japanese culture also presented itself in popular video games such as Jet Set Radio, a game that has evident references to Japanese manga and graphic novels. This trend of Japan influencing children‚Äôs popular culture continues with well-known icons such as Astro Boy, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, Pok√©mon, and Hello Kitty. Japanese media is commonly described as Kawaii, a Japanese term meaning ‚Äúcute‚Äù and \\"comfortable\\" in English. Reasons for Japanification As more and more people became interested in Japanese society, the numbers of students and individuals learning the Japanese language increased. At its height of popularity there was a 10.3% increase in Japanese language enrollments in U.S. colleges and universities between 2006 and 2009, 66,605 in 2006 to 73,434 in 2009. However, the Japan Foundation statistics indicate that the number of people taking the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) has been steadily declining since the peak in 2009. This temporary increase in Japanese language learners in the early years of the 21st century was unusual given Japan‚Äôs economic gloom and turmoil in the last two decades, but it could be explained by the rising popularity of manga and anime around 2009. Manga and anime were seen by some as a leading factor in reasons why the number of Japanese language learners was increasing, ‚ÄúOver 50% of Japanese language learners surveyed by the Japan Foundation in 2009 cited wanting to learn how to read manga and anime as a key reason for studying Japanese.‚Äù Today, we see what many consider is a rapid decline in the global popularity of Japanese manga and anime. Some praise the 10% of high quality manga and anime for its initial popularity, and blame its recent decline in popularity on the 90% of low quality material that has been released in recent years. Another possible reason for the decline in sales could be the increase in \\"scanlations\\", which are described in a statement by Japan's Digital Comic Association: \\"The 36 publishers in Japan‚Äôs Digital Comic Association and several American publishers are forming a coalition to combat the ‚Äúrampant and growing problem‚Äù of scanlations ‚Äî illicit digital copies of manga either translated by fans or scanned directly from legitimate English releases\\". Taiwan In Taiwan, the term ÂìàÊó•Êóè (harizu) is used, which means \\"the tribe that adores Japan.\\" The term is taken from ÂìàÊó•ÊùèÂ≠ê (Hari Kyoko), a female Taiwanese manga author. Due to Japanese war crimes such as the Nanking Massacre and the atrocities committed in Korea under Japanese rule, anti- Japanese sentiment is much stronger in mainland China and Korea than in Taiwan, where the Japanese colonization is not remembered as bitterly. Japanification in economics In addition to its cultural definition this process can be described as the transformation of an economy into one that follows the steps of Japan. In other words, it is a term used by economists that refers to falling into the same deflationary trap of collapsed demand that caused the lost decade. Japanification is an ongoing issue today as the U.S., U.K., and other countries go through similar economic issues.

Structure It passes obliquely upward, forward, and to the right, in the direction of the heart's axis, as high as the upper border of the second right costal cartilage, describing a slight curve in its course, and being situated, about behind the posterior surface of the sternum. The total length is about . =Components= The aortic root is the portion of the aorta beginning at the aortic annulus and extending to the sinotubular junction. It is sometimes regarded as a part of the ascending aorta, and sometimes regarded as a separate entity from the rest of the ascending aorta. Between each commissure of the aortic valve and opposite the cusps of the aortic valve, three small dilatations called the aortic sinuses. The sinotubular junction is the point in the ascending aorta where the aortic sinuses end and the aorta becomes a tubular structure. =Size= A thoracic aortic diameter greater than 3.5 cm is generally considered dilated, whereas a diameter greater than 4.5 cm is generally considered to be a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Still, the average diameter in the population varies by for example age and sex. The upper limit of standard reference range of the ascending aorta may be up to 4.3 cm among large, elderly individuals. Relations At the union of the ascending aorta with the aortic arch the caliber of the vessel is increased, owing to a bulging of its right wall. This dilatation is termed the bulb of the aorta, and on transverse section presents a somewhat oval figure. The ascending aorta is contained within the pericardium, and is enclosed in a tube of the serous pericardium, common to it and the pulmonary artery. The ascending aorta is covered at its commencement by the trunk of the pulmonary artery and the right auricula, and, higher up, is separated from the sternum by the pericardium, the right pleura, the anterior margin of the right lung, some loose areolar tissue, and the remains of the thymus; posteriorly, it rests upon the left atrium and right pulmonary artery. On the right side, it is in relation with the superior vena cava and right atrium, the former lying partly behind it; on the left side, with the pulmonary artery. Branches The only branches of the ascending aorta are the two coronary arteries which supply the heart; they arise near the commencement of the aorta from the aortic sinuses which are opposite the aortic valve. Clinical significance ' is extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the ascending aorta. It makes aortic surgery difficult, especially aortic cross-clamping, and incisions may result in excessive aortic injury and/or arterial embolism.

History  Former Armstrong Cork Company building in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (built circa 1901) In 1860, Thomas M. Armstrong, the son of Scottish-Irish immigrants from Derry, joined with John D. Glass to open a one-room shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, carving bottle stoppers from cork by hand. Their first deliveries were made in a wheelbarrow. Armstrong was a business pioneer in some respects: he branded each cork he shipped as early as 1864, and soon was putting a written guarantee in each burlap bag of corks he shipped from his big new factory. The company grew to be the largest cork supplier in the world by the 1890s. The company incorporated in 1891. Cork began being displaced by other closures, but the company introduced insulating corkboard and brick. In 1906, two years before he died, Thomas Armstrong concluded that the solid foundation of the future was covered with linoleum, and construction began on a new factory in a cornfield at the edge of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In 1909, Armstrong linoleum was first offered to the trade. After corkboard, the logical move was to fiberboard, and then to ceiling board. Cork tile and linoleum led to vinyl flooring, then ceramic tile, laminate flooring and carpeting. In 1917, Armstrong Cork signed with the Batton Company advertising agency, a relationship that continues to this day through their corporate descendants. In 1998, Armstrong acquired Triangle Pacific Corp., a leading manufacturer of hardwood flooring and kitchen/bathroom cabinets. In 2009, Armstrong's annual net Sales Total US$2.8Billion. Armstrong Cabinets is no longer owned by Armstrong World Industries. The business was sold to American Industrial Partners on October 31, 2012. In 2016, Armstrong spun off the flooring business into a new company, Armstrong Flooring.

The home was later used in other capacities, such as meeting space and temporary housing for visiting employees. Armstrong owned the property from May 1920 to December 2011. The property is located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The oldest part of Armstrong Manor, originally known as Bloomington Farm, was built in 1866 by David P. Locher, a prosperous local tanner, banker, and farmer.http://lcapp1.co.lancaster.pa.us/aoweb/ParcelDetails.aspx?ParcelID=3901601000000|&searchType;=propAdd&streetnum;=2025&streetDir;=&streetName;=Lititz&streetSuffix; Lancaster Country Property Report Card The 4-acre property remained a part of Locher's estate until April 9, 1906, when Grove Locher purchased the property for $21,000. On May 29, 1920, the then Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Armstrong Cork Company purchased the mansion from Grove Locher and his wife for $26,930. The company's second president, Charles D. Armstrong, was disturbed by the conditions in which his son, Dwight, and other new sales employees were living within various rented housing across Lancaster. C.D. Armstrong and his wife, Gertrude Virginia Ludden Armstrong, were also aware of the difficulties with the transition from campus life to industrial living, and desired a more comfortable living space for their sales trainees.http://lancasteronline.com/article/local/308335_Armstrong-to-cut-jobs --shut-Manor.html Armstrong to Cut Jobs, Shut Manor.

The house was used as a living space for the sales trainees (all single men) during their 6-month training program at the Lancaster, PA flooring plant. The company spent an additional $27,742.87 on renovations and renamed the property Armstrong Manor. More recently, The Manor provided housing for visiting Armstrong employees and customers, and continued to fulfill its role as a meeting space. The property also had a facilities maintenance department (plumbers, electricians, and a mailroom) to support the property. Rodgers & Associates Buys Armstrong Manor.

In 1938, Armstrong bought Whitall Tatum, a leading manufacturer of glass stand-off insulators for utility poles since 1922. The existing molds were eventually replaced with molds bearing the Armstrong name. In April 1969, the business was sold to Kerr Glass Manufacturing Corporation. Demand was rapidly dropping, as utilities were converting to ceramics or going underground, and Kerr moved production to their Dunkirk, Indiana factory in the mid-1970s, and ceasing production several years after that. During World War II, Armstrong made 50-caliber round ammunition, wing tips for airplanes, cork sound insulation for submarines, and camouflage. In 1952, a group of leading industrialists that included Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors, Frank W. Abrams of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Henry Ford II of Ford Motor Company, John L. McCaffrey of International Harvester, Irving S. Olds of United States Steel Corporation, Henning W. Prentis of Armstrong Cork Company, and Laird Bell of Weyerhauser Timber formed the Council for Financial Aid to Education, which increased corporate gifts to colleges from $24 million annually to $136 million annually over ten years. In 1958, Armstrong Cork Company created \\"Armstrong Contracting and Supply Corporation\\". Armstrong Cork had done insulation contracting since the early 20th century, originally focusing on cork products. Gradually, there was greater emphasis on high temperature insulation. In 1969, this business was sold in a leveraged buyout to 31 existing and retired employees of the contracting company, which became Irex Corporation. C.U.E., Inc. started as the Polyurethane Division of Armstrong Cork in the 1960s. CUE comes from \\"Custom Urethane Elastomers\\" The Fluorocarbon Company of Anaheim, California bought the division in 1972. On April 7, 1986, a group of seven employees acquired the division, in a leveraged buyout. In 1964, Armstrong bought Phoenix Chair Company, following up with Founders Furniture Company in 1965, Western Carolina Furniture Company in 1966, and both Thomasville Furniture and Caldwell Furniture in 1968. In the 1970s, they expanded with a low-end bedroom furniture line. They bought Gilliam Furniture in 1986, bought and repurposed the former Stehle polyester factory in Carysbrook, Virginia later that year, bought Westchester Group in 1987, and Gordon's in 1988; as well as making a major expansion to Thomasville that year. In 1995, Thomasville Furniture was sold to Interco (which became Furniture Brands International), a leading furniture manufacturer, with such brands as Broyhill and Lane.

The western region stores were known for a number of years as \\"Downings\\" in Colorado and \\"Appliance-TV City\\" in Arizona and California. History =Beginning= Silo was founded by Sidney Cooper in Philadelphia, PA, in 1946 following his service in World War II. The company was named for himself and for his wife Lorraine, combining the first two letters of each name. Prior to opening its first retail store, Silo operated as a door-to-door installment business. With the advent of television, Cooper saw an opportunity and seized it. He opened his first store about 1951 in the Manayunk section of Philadelphia, featuring appliances and televisions. Silo was an early discounter, operating under the name \\"Silo Discount Centers.\\" Silo regularly opened on Sundays, violating the Blue laws then in effect. Cooper claimed that it was necessary to open on Sunday in order to serve working families, and was even arrested at least once for doing so. On one such occasion, the press was on hand to cover the arrest, apparently tipped off by Cooper himself, who understood the value of free publicity. The company grew rapidly, opening stores throughout the tri-state region over the next twenty years. Silo went public in 1962, raising money to fuel its geographic expansion throughout a region bounded by Trenton, NJ, Wilmington, DE, and Reading, PA. The company's early advertising stressed that the \\"S\\" in Silo stood for savings, service, selection and satisfaction. Early store formats of 4,000 to 8,000 square feet were considered large by standards of the day. Later, Silo operated stores of 12,000 to 25,000 square feet, with two warehouse outlets of almost 60,000 square feet in Buffalo, NY and New Orleans, LA. Stores were generally freestanding, with some attached to shopping centers or malls. =Expansion= In 1970 Silo made its first foray beyond the Philadelphia metro area, purchasing a number of Downing's stores from Sam Bloom in Denver, Colorado. Shortly after, Silo purchased three Appliance-TV City stores in Arizona from its founder, Jay Winslow. The Colorado and Arizona acquisitions enjoyed rapid expansion, as Silo applied its formula of low pricing, huge selection, and hard hitting advertising. The 1970s Silo television jingle, \\"Silo is having a sale,\\" was so pervasive (and some would add, annoying), that many Philadelphians today can still hum the jingle and would not believe that it has not aired in forty years. In a later example, typical Silo's hard-hitting price promotions, a 1986 advertisement offered a stereo system for \\"299 bananas.\\" Customers in Seattle and in El Paso took this offer literally and came to the stores with real bananas. Silo honored its offer, trading 32 stereos in Seattle and three in El Paso for bananas. The stores lost $10,465 on these transactions. In 1972 Silo launched Audio World, a wholly owned subsidiary which sold stereo systems and audio components. Initially a few freestanding stores in the greater Philadelphia area, by 1974 Audio World departments were being incorporated into all existing and new Silo stores when the concept proved successful. The audio expansion came at the expense of small appliances whose profit margins had disappeared for Silo, which thereafter concentrated on retailing only large appliances along with the new audio and TV sections, and was branded as Silo/Audio World for a number of years. In 1976 Cooper died at the age of 57 and leadership of the business passed to his son-in-law Barry Feinberg, an attorney. At the time of Cooper's death, Silo operated 40 stores with revenues of $60 million. Feinberg expanded an already aggressive advertising campaign and eschewed Cooper's approach of geographic expansion by acquisition. Feinberg believed that Silo could stand on its own in new markets, without purchasing \\"recognition,\\" and his approach was successful for a number of years. Silo was acquired by Cyclops Steel, a Pittsburgh-based specialty steelmaker in February 1980. Cyclops had decided to diversify outside of the steel business and had already made one retail acquisition, the Busy Beaver home store chain in Pittsburgh, PA. Cyclops was willing to bet aggressively on Feinberg's strategy of attacking new markets with multiple simultaneous store openings accompanied by a massive advertising blitz - all under the Silo brand. Silo expanded rapidly and coast-to-coast over the next several years. Silo purchased 19 stores in the Los Angeles area from the Federated Group in 1989. Prior to opening its first store, the company launched a highly visible but deliberately ambiguous \\"teaser\\" ad campaign, \\"The Silos are coming\\", arousing much curiosity, and even fear of the upcoming date. The campaign, created Saatchi & Saatchi Creative Director Jay Montgomery, featured quasi man-on-the-street speculation about the \\"19 Silo sites proposed for the Southland\\". The campaign generated over 10,000 phone calls the first week. Callers were sent coupons and a t-shirt reading, \\"I feel better with a Silo nearby\\". The effort was so successful, Silo had to increase its sales projections twice during the soft opening. Feinberg personally called about 180 people who were legitimately upset by the ruse. Along with his apology, a $500 gift certificate was sent to each Cyclops ultimately sold the retailer to Dixons Group PLC, a Great Britain-based firm, in 1987. Cyclops investment was quite successful, returning more than ten times its original investment in just seven years. At its peak, Silo operated 232 stores throughout the United States, with revenues of $1.2 billion. Dixons struggled to adapt is European style to the US markets. While competitors were opening much larger superstores, Dixons was comfortable with the far smaller footprint of its urban retail outlets in the UK, often as small as 2,000 square feet. Dixons failed to make the needed adjustments; ultimately, Feinberg and Dixon's had a falling out over this and other policies, and Feinberg left. =Fretter Buyout and Final Years= In 1993, Dixons decided to throw in the towel on its investment, and sold a controlling stake in Silo for $45 million to Fretter, Inc. Fretter was a Detroit, Michigan-based company, operating electronics stores under the Fretter's, YES! (short for Your Electronics Store), Dash Concepts, and Fred Schmid banners. At the time of the purchase, Silo featured 183 stores that were, due to stiff competition from such retailers as Circuit City and Best Buy, facing dwindling sales. The Fretter stores were facing similar competition, and Fretter management hoped that the combination would create a retail electronics powerhouse better suited to take on the up-and- coming companies. By the time of the Fretter acquisition, Silo was damaged goods. Fretter was faced with integrating a chain with both dwindling market share and outdated and aging inventory. One way Fretter dealt with this challenge was to convert several of the Silo stores into outlet-based units to sell off the excess inventory. Fretter also attempted to bill its stores as superstores, with a marketing strategy similar to that of Circuit City and Best Buy. However, the smaller size of its Silo and Fretter's units (10,000 to 15,000 square feet, as opposed to 35,000 square feet or more for a typical Circuit City store), made this an untenable strategy. According to one analyst, \\"Fretter was vanilla. You have to stand for something. They were so price-conscious that they never even thought about a personality. That's what our arguments with them were always about: You have to stand for something in the consumer's mind. You can't just live on price alone, or you'll go out of business.\\" Declining market shares, lingering debt from the acquisition, and an outdated store format eventually doomed Fretter to failure. The company began to exit its markets, quickly and quietly, and customers and employees would sometimes find the stores suddenly closed during normal business hours. Silo's seven Pittsburgh-area stores, for example, were precipitously closed when employees received word that they were to pack all remaining inventory and close the store that day. Employees that remained silent during closing were promised a generous severance. Scott White, a former store manager, reportedly went to the press with the information. This resulted in a mob of customers flocking to the Pittsburgh stores to demand goods left on lay-a-way, or a return of their deposits. Silo reopened their doors for 3 days to accommodate these customers. By the end of 1995, Fretter closed all remaining Silo stores and placed the parent company into bankruptcy. The remainder of the company's stores were closed by May 1996.

It is the administrative center of Kozelets Raion. Kozelets is located on the Oster River, a tributary of the Dnieper. Population: The town was first mentioned in written documents in 1098, but its status as an urban-type settlement (a step below that of a city) was granted in 1924. Notable attractions in the city includes the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin designed in the Ukrainian Baroque style by architects Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi and Andrei Kvasov. Kozelets also houses several local food industries, and a veterinary technicum. History Kozelets was first mentioned in 1098 as a fortified town in the East Slavic state of Kyivan Rus'. During times of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Kozelets was known by the name Kozlohrad (). The town's main cathedral, designed by Ivan Hryhorovych- Barskyi and Andrei Kvasov. In the beginning of the 17th century, Kozelets was an important regional trade center. The town was also a sotnia town in the Pereiaslav and Kyiv Regiment of the Cossack Hetmanate during the 17-18th centuries. In 1656, Kozelets was granted the Magdeburg rights. The Kozelets Cossack Rada elected Yakym Somko as the Hetman of the Cossacks in 1662. After the Tatar invasion of 1669, Kozelets was partially destroyed. In 1744 Empress Elizabeth of Russia stayed in Kozelets while making a pilgrimage to Kyiv. The city also served as a regional center of the Kyiv Governorate, Malorossiya, and Chernigov Governorates of the Russian Empire during the 18-19th centuries. At the end of the 19th century, Kozelets's population was 5,420. After the breakup of the Russian Empire leading to the Russian Civil War, Kozelets became a part of the Soviet Union. In 1924, its status as a city was removed and given that of an urban-type settlement. During World War II, the Nazi Einsatzgruppen executed 125 of the town's Jews, a population which numbered 2,000 before the war. Attractions The cathedral's hand-crafted iconostasis was made in Italy. Being a regimental Cossack town, Kozelets has some important architectural monuments. This includes the Regimental Chancellery Building (the current town hall), the Darahan Mansion complex, the Saint Michael's Church (built in 1784) and the Ascension Church (1864‚Äì66). The town's main cathedral and architectural attraction is the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin. The cathedral was built in the mid-18th century in the late Ukrainian Baroque style by architects Ivan Hryhorovych- Barskyi and Andrei Kvasov.

The PDM was published on May 28, 2006. The information contained in the PDM was collected by a collaborative task force which includes members of the American Psychoanalytic Association, the International Psychoanalytical Association, the Division of Psychoanalysis (Division 39) of the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry, and the National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work. Although it is based on current neuroscience and treatment outcome studies, Carey (2006) points out that many of the concepts in the PDM are adapted from the classical psychoanalytic tradition of psychotherapy. For example, the PDM indicates that the anxiety disorders may be traced to the \\"four basic danger situations\\" described by Sigmund Freud (1926) as the loss of a significant other; the loss of love; the loss of body integrity; and the loss of affirmation by one's own conscience. It uses a new perspective on the existing diagnostic system as it enables clinicians to describe and categorize personality patterns, related social and emotional capacities, unique mental profiles, and personal experiences of the patient. The PDM is not intended to compete with the DSM or ICD. The authors report the work emphasizes \\"individual variations as well as commonalities\\" by \\"focusing on the full range of mental functioning\\" and serves as a \\"[complement to] the DSM and ICD efforts in cataloguing [sic] symptoms. The task force intends for the PDM to augment the existing diagnostic taxonomies by providing \\"a multi dimensional approach to describe the intricacies of the patient's overall functioning and ways of engaging in the therapeutic process.\\". With the publication of the DSM-3 in 1980, the manual switched from a psychoanalytically influenced dimensional model to a \\"neo-Kraepelinian\\" descriptive symptom-focused model based on present versus absent symptoms. The PDM provided a return to a psychodynamic model for the nosological evaluation of symptom clusters, personality dimensions, and dimensions of mental functioning.  Taxonomy  = Dimension I: Personality Patterns and Disorders = This first dimension classifies personality patterns in two domains. First, it looks at the spectrum of personality types and places the person's personality on a continuum from unhealthy and maladaptive to healthy and adaptive. Second, it classifies the how the person \\"organizes mental functioning and engages the world\\". The task force adds, \\"This dimension has been placed first in the PDM system because of the accumulating evidence that symptoms or problems cannot be understood, assessed, or treated in the absence of an understanding of the mental life of the person who has the symptoms\\". In other words, a list of symptoms characteristic of a diagnosis does not adequately inform a clinician how to understand and treat the symptoms without proper context. By analogy, if a patient went to her physician complaining of watering eyes and a runny nose, the symptoms alone do not indicate the appropriate treatment. Her symptoms could be a function of seasonal allergies, a bacterial sinus infection, the common cold, or she may have just come from her grandmother's funeral. The doctor might treat allergies with an antihisamine, the sinus infection with antibiotics, the cold with zinc, and give her patient a Kleenex tissue after the funeral. All four conditions may have very similar symptoms; all four condition are treated very differently. = Dimension II: Mental Functioning = Next, the PDM provides a \\"detailed description of emotional functioning\\" which are understood to be \\"the capacities that contribute to an individual's personality and overall level of psychological health or pathology\\". This dimension provides a \\"microscopic\\" examination of the patient's mental life by systematically accounting for their functional capacity to * Process information * Self-regulate * Establish and maintain relationships * Experience, organize, and express feelings and emotions at different levels * Represent, differentiate, and integrate experience * Utilize appropriate coping strategies and defense mechanisms * Accurately observe oneself and others * Form internal values and standards = Dimension III: Manifest Symptoms and Concerns = The third dimension starts with the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic categories; moreover, beyond simply listing symptoms, the PDM \\"goes on to describe the affective states, cognitive processes, somatic experiences, and relational patterns most often associated clinically\\" with each diagnosis. In this dimension, \\"symptom clusters\\" are \\"useful descriptors\\" which presents the patient's \\"symptom patterns in terms of the patient's personal experience of his or her prevailing difficulties\\". The task force concludes, \\"The patient may evidence a few or many patterns, which may or may not be related, and which should be seen in the context of the person's personality and mental functioning. The multi dimensional approach... provides a systematic way to describe patients that is faithful to their complexity and helpful in planning appropriate treatments\\".  The new edition (PDM-2)  Guilford Press published a new edition of the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM-2), developed by a steering committee composed by Vittorio Lingiardi (Editor), Nancy McWilliams (Editor), and Robert S. Wallerstein (Honorary Chair). Guilford Press received a manuscript for PDM-2 in September 2016, and the release date was June 20, 2017.Guilford Press Customer Service Like the PDM-1, the PDM-2 classifies patients on three axes: 'P-Axis - Personality Syndromes', 'M-Axis - Profiles of Mental Functioning', and 'S-Axis - Symptom Patterns: The Subjective Experience'. The axis of personality syndromes is intended to be viewed as a \\"map\\" of personality instead of a listing of personality disorders as in the DSM and ICD. The PDM-2 defines different terms as part of the P-Axis including \\"personality\\", \\"character\\", \\"temperament\\", \\"traits\\", \\"type\\", \\"style\\", and \\"defense\\". The S-Axis bears a lot of similarity to the DSM and ICD due to the inclusion of predominantly psychotic disorders, mood disorders, disorders related primarily to anxiety, event- and stressor-related disorders, somatic symptom disorders and addiction disorders.

He has worked as a foreign correspondent in fifteen different countries. Early life and education Cohen was born in London to a Jewish family. His father, Sydney Cohen, a doctor, emigrated from South Africa to England in the 1950s. In the late 1960s, Roger studied at Westminster School, one of Britain's top private schools. He won a scholarship and would have entered College, the scholars' House, but was told that a Jew could not attend College or hold his particular scholarship. (The scholarship initially offered to him was intended for persons who professed the Christian faith, as he later learned while researching the affair.) Instead, he was awarded a different scholarship. In 1973, Cohen travelled with friends throughout the Middle East, including Iran and Afghanistan. He drove a Volkswagen Kombi named 'Pigpen' after the late keyboard-playing frontman of the Grateful Dead. (In the article cited, Cohen misidentifies Pigpen as a drummer.) He studied History and French at Balliol College, Oxford and graduated in 1977.The New York Times Names Roger Cohen Foreign Editor. Business Wire. 14 March 2002. He left that year for Paris to teach English and to write for Paris Metro. He started working for Reuters and the agency transferred him to Brussels. Cohen's mother, also from South Africa (b. 1929), attempted suicide in London in 1978. She died there in 1999 and was buried in Johannesburg. Career In 1983, Cohen joined The Wall Street Journal in Rome to cover the Italian economy. The Journal later transferred him to Beirut. He joined The New York Times in January 1990. In the summer of 1991, he co- authored with Claudio Gatti In the Eye of the Storm: The Life of General H. Norman Schwarzkopf. The authors wrote the book based on information from Norman Schwarzkopf's sister Sally, without Schwarzkopf's help.In the Eye of the Storm: The Life of General H. Norman Schwarzkopf.

Posted 9 November 2007. = Iraq = Cohen supported the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq. He criticised the Bush administration's handling of the occupation while still supporting the cause given the brutality of Saddam Hussein's regime. In January 2009, he commented that Saddam's \\"death-and- genocide machine killed about 400,000 Iraqis and another million or so people in Iran and Kuwait.\\" He wrote that \\"I still believe Iraq's freedom outweighs its terrible price.\\" He opposed the 2007 'surge' of troops into Iraq. In June 2007, he advocated pulling out 105,000 soldiers. He argued that \\"pulling out a lot of troops is the only way to increase pressure on Maliki to make the political compromises ‚Äì on distribution of oil revenue, the constitution and de-Baathification ‚Äì that will give Iraq some long-term chance of cohering.\\" In November 2008, Cohen stated that \\"gains are real but fragile\\" in Iraq. He criticised Democratic candidate Barack Obama's calls for a 16-month withdrawal from the country, calling it irresponsible. Cohen wrote that \\"we're going to have to play buffer against the dominant Shia for several years\\". = Iran = Cohen wrote a series of articles for The New York Times in February 2009 about a trip to Iran. In his writings he expressed opposition to military action against Iran and encouraged negotiations between the United States and the Islamic Republic. He also remarked that Iranian Jews were well treated, and said the Jewish community was \\"living, working and worshiping in relative tranquility.\\" He also described the hospitality that he received in Iran, stating that \\"I'm a Jew and have seldom been treated with such consistent warmth as in Iran.\\" In his trip, he paid an Iranian agency $150 a day for the services of a translator, who filed a report on Cohen's doings with the Iranian government. His depiction of Jewish life in Iran sparked criticism from columnists and activists such as Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic Monthly\\"Roger Cohen's Very Happy Visit with Iran's Jews. Jeffrey Goldberg's Atlantic Blog. 26 February 2009. and Rafael Medoff, director of the David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies. In his Jerusalem Post op-ed, Medoff criticised Cohen for being \\"misled by the existence of synagogues\\" and further argued that Iranian Jews \\"are captives of the regime, and whatever they say is carefully calibrated not to get themselves into trouble.\\" The American Jewish Committee also criticised Cohen's articles. Dr. Eran Lerman, director of the group's Middle East directory, argued that \\"Cohen's need to argue away an unpleasant reality thus gives rise to systematic denial\\".AJC Responds to Roger Cohen Columns on Iran . By Dr. Eran Lerman. American Jewish Committee. 13 April 2009. Roger Cohen responded on 2 March, defending his observations and further elaborating that \\"Iran's Islamic Republic is no Third Reich redux. Nor is it a totalitarian state.\\" He also stated that \\"life is more difficult for them [the Jews] than for Muslims, but to suggest they [Jews] inhabit a totalitarian hell is self-serving nonsense.\\" He ended with a warning: On 12 March, Cohen accepted an invitation to meet with selected members of Los Angeles's Iranian Jewish and Bah√° º√≠ Faith communities at Sinai Temple, after receiving some of their critical mail about his column. Cohen defended his views and analysis on Iran and Israel to a partly hostile audience. Rabbi David Wolpe of the Sinai Temple criticised Cohen after the event, saying \\"increasingly I came to believe that Iran was not Cohen's sole concern; he wanted it as a stick with which to beat Israel over Gaza, whose incursion he wrote left him ashamed.\\" Cohen argued that the results of the June 2009 Iranian presidential election were fabricated, and incumbent President Ahmadinejad \\"cheated\\" his way to victory over reformist Mir Hussein Moussavi. He wrote that \\"President Obama's outreach must now await a decent interval.\\" He also commented, \\"I've also argued that, although repressive, the Islamic Republic offers significant margins of freedom by regional standards. I erred in underestimating the brutality and cynicism of a regime that understands the uses of ruthlessness.\\" He was later criticised by Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett in the New York Review of Books for trumpeting what they said were baseless accusations of electoral fraud and for his general \\"incompetence and hypocrisy\\". Cohen replied that the pair were guilty of, amongst other things, \\"a cavalier disregard for the Islamic Republic's intermittent brutality\\", were \\"apologists without a conscience\\". =Israel= Cohen wrote in January 2009 that the Israel-Palestinian conflict should not be seen by the United States as just another part of the War on Terrorism. He called for the ending of Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and the ending of the blockade of the Gaza Strip. He also supported the reconciling of Hamas with Fatah after their violent split. In addition, he criticised the Obama administration for its continuance of past United States policies towards Israel. Cohen opposed Operation Cast Lead, labelling it \\"wretchedly named ‚Äì and disastrous\\". He has accused Israelis of the \\"slaying of hundreds of Palestinian children\\" in the campaign. In an 8 March column, Cohen stated that he had \\"never previously felt so shamed by Israel's actions.\\" However, in one of his articles in The New York Times, Cohen analyses the differences between European and American attitudes toward Israel. He contrasts a growing antisemitism in Europe with Americans' generalized support for Israel, and attempts to explain why Americans are more supportive of Israel than Europeans are. In closing the article, Cohen said \\"...., on balance, I am pleased to have become a naturalized American.\\" =Pakistan and Afghanistan= On 8 November 2007, Cohen described the then $10 billion given to the Pakistani government and $22 billion given to the Afghan government as \\"self-defeating\\". He called Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf \\"a dictator with a gentleman's itch\\". He also stated that \\"the U.S. must stick with him and maintain aid for now\\", but it should press Musharraf for more political reforms. In September 2008, Cohen stated that only the Afghan people themselves can win the war.

Life Varnhagen was born in 1816, in the city of Iper√≥, Brazil. He was the son of Maria Fl√°via de S√° Magalh√£es and Friedrich Ludwig Wilhelm Varnhagen, a German-born military engineer, who was in service to the Portuguese crown and in Brazil to inspect iron foundries.Schwartz, \\"Varnhagen\\", p. 186. He received his primary education in Rio de Janeiro. At an early age, he went with his family to Lisbon, where he studied at the Real Col√©gio Militar da Luz. In the civil war in Portugal, he served those supporting Dom Pedro I. He returned to his studies, where he learned paleography and studied political economy and languages (French, German, English).Schwartz, \\"Varnhagen\\", p. 186. His first History work would be Not√≠cia do Brasil, written between 1835 and 1838. His research would lead him to find Pedro √Ålvares Cabral's long-lost grave at the Igreja da Gra√ßa, in Santar√©m. He was admitted at the Sciences Academy of Lisbon and graduated in military engineering at the Academia Real de Fortifica√ß√£o, Artilharia e Desenho. He returned to Brazil in 1840, entering at the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute in 1841. In 1844 he obtained Brazilian citizenship, and could apply to a diplomatic career. He served in Portugal and Spain, where he was able to utilize the archives in Seville and Simancas for his history of Brazil.Schwartz, \\"Varnhagen\\", p. 187 He later served in Paraguay, where he found the current regime of Carlos Antonio L√≥pez odious, but he gathered further materials for his history of Brazil, particularly on the Tup√≠ Indians.Schwartz, \\"Varnhagen\\", p. 188. He also served in Venezuela, the Republic of New Granada (modern Colombia), Ecuador, Chile (where he met his wife, an aristocratic Chilean lady Do√±a Carmen Ovalle y Vicu√±a, marrying her in 1864), Peru and the Netherlands. He published the first volume of his masterpiece, Hist√≥ria Geral do Brasil, in 1854. Its second volume was published in 1857. In 1872, Emperor Pedro II would give him the title of Baron of Porto Seguro, being elevated to Viscount two years later. His final diplomatic service was in Vienna, Austria, where he was serving as a minister when he died in 1878. His remains were transported to Santiago, Chile, but would be years later removed to a monument erected in honor of him at the city of Sorocaba. Part of his library was acquired by bibliophile Jos√© Mindlin. Works Varnhagen's work was recognized at the time as a major contribution to historical writing on Brazil, with Alexander von Humboldt, the great Prussia scientist and intellectual, saying that \\"I will be glad to have [Varnhagen's history of Brazil] in its entirety and to see it reposing in our library.\\"Schwartz \\"Varnhagen\\" p. 188, quoting Lessa, \\"Vida e obra.\\" Varnhagen participated in political debate about the importance of Brazil's Indians in the formation of Brazil. He rejected the Indianist school that saw Brazil's Indians as \\"noble savages\\" and \\"a basis for brasilidade (Brazilianness)., In volume two of his Hist√≥ria Geral do Brazil, Varnhagen added an appendix that dealt with this issue. \\"The Indians were not masters of Brazil nor is the name Brazilian applicable to them as savages.

In general, Varnhagen was pro-monarchy, since it gave Brazil a strong central government and took the part of Portuguese colonists in debates about the colonial era. He had a mixed assessment of the Jesuits in Brazil, whom he did credit for contributions. For the thirty-year Dutch occupation of Brazil's northeast, he viewed the episode as lamentable on one hand, but beneficial to Brazil on the other, viewing the Dutch as \\"a nation more active and industrious\\" than Brazil at the time.quoted Schwartz, \\"Varnhagen\\", p. 201. * Not√≠cia do Brasil (1839).

The limit can vary from store to store. Floor limits have become less significant as credit cards started being processed electronically and all transactions are typically authorized. History The term floor limit comes from the days when it was the maximum amount which could be approved on the floor (of the retailer), beyond which the cash register operator would have to call for approval. Floor limits were of more significance when most credit card merchants processed transactions by taking a physical imprint of the card rather than electronically swiping the magnetic strip, and obtaining an authorization required time-consuming human intervention. With modern card readers, most merchants and banks will obtain an authorization even on very small charges, as it costs little to do so and helps protect against fraud. However, the concept of a floor limit may still come into play in certain cases. A few merchants still use the older system of taking a physical imprint of the card. Additionally, if the merchant or merchant's bank has trouble contacting the customer's bank due to computer network issues, transactions under a certain floor limit will still be approved electronically immediately. Floor limits do not apply to certain types of debit card (such as Visa Electron and Solo), as these cards require authorisation for every transaction to prevent the cardholder becoming overdrawn. Example If a store has a floor limit of $30.00, a purchase costing $29.99 (or less) would not need to be authorized by the customer's bank. However, a transaction of $30.00 (or more) would require authorization to confirm that the customer has the necessary funds available in their bank account. Problems A floor limit may cause an account to become overdrawn, even where the account holder does not have an authorized overdraft. In the EU the Payments Accounts Directive (S.I. No. 482/2016) provides for a basic bank account which is prohibited from having an agreed overdraft facility, however floor limits may force the account into an overdrawn position.

Major operating system components, including System Restore, Task Scheduler, and Windows Update, rely on TxF for stability. During the development of Windows Vista, WinFS also relied on TxF for storing files. Due to its complexity and various nuances which developers need to consider as part of application development, Microsoft has deprecated TxF and stated that it may be removed in a future version of Windows. Microsoft has strongly recommended that developers investigate using the alternatives rather than adopting the Transactional NTFS API platform which may not be available in future versions of Windows.  Overview  Transactional NTFS allows for files and directories to be created, modified, renamed, and deleted atomically. Using transactions ensures correctness of operation; in a series of file operations (done as a transaction), the operation will be committed if all the operations succeed. In case of any failure, the entire operation will roll back and fail. Transactional NTFS is implemented on top of the Kernel Transaction Manager, which is a Windows kernel component introduced in Windows Vista that provides transactioning of objects in the kernel. The NTFS file system already supports journaling of low-level operations, such as writing a block of data. Transactional NTFS expands on this capability to include: * Atomic operations on a single file: A common example of this is saving a file from an application; if the application or machine were to crash while writing the file, then only part of the file could be written, possibly resulting in a corrupted file. This would be a very significant problem if a previous version of the file was being over-written, as data would likely be lost. * Atomic operations spanning multiple files: If an application needs to update several files at once with a set of changes, all the necessary file operations can be performed as a single transaction, preventing inconsistent updates in the event of a failure. * Atomic operations spanning multiple computers: Performing the same operation on multiple computers is a fairly common administrative task in a corporate network; Transactional NTFS integrates with the Distributed Transaction Coordinator to ensure that the change is successfully applied to all machines. With the exception of read operations, using Transactional NTFS for transactions on Encrypting File System files is not supported in Windows Vista until Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008.

It is a combination of clindamycin, an antibiotic, and benzoyl peroxide, an antiseptic. All formulations are prescription drugs. Common side effects include peeling, itching, and dryness of the skin where the gel was applied.  Medical uses  The gel is used on the skin to treat light to medium acne vulgaris in people 12 years and older. BenzaClin is to be applied twice daily, on BenzaClin. Retrieved 2017-01-25. and Duac and Onexton are once-a-day medications. Continued use beyond 12-weeks has not been studied. = Efficacy = There is an average 52% decrease in inflammatory acne lesions by week 12. The combination less is effective than benzoyl peroxide/salicylic acid after short-term treatment of two to four weeks, but the two treatments showed similar effectiveness after ten to twelve weeks. = Pregnancy and lactation = Currently, studies on whether or not the use of benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin gels is teratogenic or has adverse effects on nursing infants has not been performed. While oral clindamycin passes into breast milk, no such data are available for clindamyin in gel form. Limited data regarding topical benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin have shown no safety problems.  Contraindications  The gel is not recommended for those who are allergic to clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide, any components of the formulation, or lincomycin. Individuals previously diagnosed with regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, or antibiotic-associated colitis are also recommended not to use it.  Side effects  Common side effects are peeling, itching, redness, dryness, burning, and dermatitis. Benzoyl peroxide bleaches hair, clothes, towels, bedclothing, and the like. Prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sun light (UV rays) is not recommended because the gel may cause photosensitivity. Irritation due to benzoyl peroxide can be reduced by avoiding harsh facial cleansers and wearing sunscreen prior to sun exposure. Clinical studies have shown systemic absorption of clindamycin through topical application, in some cases leading to diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis. Reports of anaphylaxis were also seen. However, the sources of these reports were personal accounts without controls and of an unknown population, thus it is difficult to attribute their cause to the benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin gel.  Interactions  No formal interaction studies have been done. Combination with topical products containing alcohol or astringents, as well as skin peelings, may increase the irritant effect of benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin. Topical erythromycin may antagonise the effect of clindamycin, although this has only be demonstrated in in vitro studies. Topical tretinoin and other retinoids may be inactivated by benzoyl peroxide or increase its irritant effect.  Pharmacology  = Mechanism of action = Clindamycin phosphate is a water-soluble ester of the semi-synthetic antibiotic clindamycin, which is synthesized from lincomycin. Like the macrolide antibiotics, it acts as a bacteriostatic agent by interfering with the 50S subunit of the ribosome of Cutibacterium acnes, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and preventing bacteria from replicating. C. acnes plays a role in the development of acne. Benzoyl peroxide also kills C. acnes, but by releasing free radical oxygen species, thus oxidizing bacterial proteins. Also, it dries out the area by reducing sebum production, prevents clogged pores, and is a keratolytic agent. Since benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizer, not an antibiotic, it is not subject to C. acnes resistance unlike clindamycin. Both ingredients have been shown to reduce the number of acne lesions with statistical significance. = Pharmacokinetics = Clindamycin phosphate is an inactive prodrug. It is quickly activated to clindamycin by hydrolysis. After four weeks of application during a study, 0.043% of the used clindamycin dose were found in the blood. Benzoyl peroxide is only absorbed through the skin after reduction to benzoic acid, which is subsequently metabolized to hippuric acid and eliminated via the kidneys.  Society and culture  =Brand names= There are several branded drugs approved by the FDA. The first is Acanya, a 1.2% clindamycin phosphate and 2.5% benzoyl peroxide; though because Valeant acquired the rights to Acanya when it bought out Dow Pharmaceutical Science in 2009, it should not be considered a competitor. The other drug, Duac, a 1.2% clindamycin phosphate ad 5% benzoyl peroxide, was approved by the FDA on 26 August 2002. Currently Duac costs $362.69 for 45 grams in the US (significantly less elsewhere, e.g. $15 for 60 grams in Poland) and Onexton costs $477.74 for 50 grams. BenzaClin, another gel, has the same concentrations as Duac. = Patent = Dow Pharmaceuticals filed the patent for Onexton, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the patent on 16 October 2012.

For the medieval Knights Templar, see Knights Templar. See also Knights Templar and popular culture. The Knights Templar, full name The United Religious, Military and Masonic Orders of the Temple and of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta, is a fraternal order affiliated with Freemasonry. Unlike the initial degrees conferred in a regular Masonic Lodge, which (in most Regular Masonic jurisdictions) only require a belief in a Supreme Being regardless of religious affiliation, the Knights Templar is one of several additional Masonic Orders in which membership is open only to Freemasons who profess a belief in Christianity. One of the obligations entrants to the order are required to declare is to protect and defend the Christian faith. The word \\"United\\" in its full title indicates that more than one historical tradition and more than one actual order are jointly controlled within this system. The individual orders 'united' within this system are principally the Knights of the Temple (Knights Templar), the Knights of Malta, the Knights of St Paul, and only within the York Rite, the Knights of the Red Cross. Like the Masonic Red Cross of Constantine being inspired by the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George and the Order of Malta being inspired by the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the Masonic order of Knights Templar derives its name from the medieval Catholic military order Knights Templar. However, it does not claim any direct lineal descent from the original Templar order. History =Knightly symbolism in Freemasonry= The earliest documented link between Freemasonry and the Crusades is the 1737 oration of the Chevalier Ramsay. This claimed that European Freemasonry came about from an interaction between crusader masons and the Knights Hospitaller.Pietre-Stones Biography of Ramsay retrieved 22 June 2012 This is repeated in the earliest known \\"Moderns\\" ritual, the Berne manuscript, written in French between 1740 and 1744.Berne Manuscript(French text) In 1751 Baron Karl Gotthelf von Hund und Altengrotkau began the Order of Strict Observance, which ritual he claimed to have received from the reconstituted Templar Order in 1743 in Paris. He also claimed to have met two of the \\"unknown superiors\\" who directed all of masonry, one of whom was Prince Charles Edward Stuart. The order went into decline when he failed to produce any evidence to support his claims, and was wound up shortly after his death.Karl Gotthelf von Hund und Altengrotkau German Wikipedia retrieved 26 July 2012The Temple and the Lodge, M.

This lodge now began to grant dispensations to other lodges to confer the Knights Templar Degree.

At that time, there were eight known Templar encampments in England, the most senior being the Encampment of Redemption at York, and the Baldwyn encampment at Bristol, at whose request Dunckerley began his mission. Under his leadership, the number of encampments steadily grew until his death in 1795. Stasis then followed, until in 1805 their Royal Patron, Duke of Kent, became Grand Master himself, re-energising the society and launching it into an era of growth and development. Dunckerley laid the foundation for this not only by promoting the order, but by standardising the ritual and insisting on proper record keeping.issuu.com Dr. Susan Mitchell Sommers, The Revival of a Patriotic Order: Knights Templar in England and New York, Knight Templar Magazine, 2 January 2011, retrieved 2 November 2012 The Grand Conclave went into a period of decline between 1872 and 1895, when it was re-founded as the present day Great Priory of England and Wales. Administration The position of the United Masonic Orders of the Temple and of Malta among the appendant bodies in England and Wales Depending upon the geographical jurisdiction, the Knights Templar exist either as part of the York Rite or as an independent organization. Though the York Rite and the independent versions share many similarities there are key differences which are described below. Outside the York Rite, membership is by invitation only. Candidates are required to be Master Masons, and Royal Arch Masons, and to sign a declaration that they profess the Doctrine of the Holy and Undivided Trinity. In some Australian States, the requirement of being a Royal Arch Mason no longer applies. Local bodies of Knights Templar are known as Preceptories; local bodies of Knights of St Paul are known as Chapters; local bodies of Knights of Malta are known as Priories; all operate under a Grand or Great Priory, often with an intermediate level of Provincial Priories. Although some jurisdictions maintain a separate Great Priory of the Temple and Great Priory of Malta (as, for example, in England), the Grand Master and other officers of both Great Priories hold simultaneous equal office in both bodies. Three degrees are administered in this system: *The Degree of Knight Templar (Order of the Temple) *The Degree of Knight of St. Paul (incorporating the Mediterranean Pass) *The Degree of Knight of Malta (Order of Malta) In England and Wales, the \\"Great Priory of England and Wales\\" for the Masonic Knights Templar is administrated from Mark Masons' Hall, London. The Degrees or Orders =The Illustrious Order of the Red Cross (Order of the Red Cross)= Teachings The Cross patt√©e, symbol of the Order of the Temple in the independent body. The Order of the Red Cross continues or reverts to the period of the Royal Arch Degree when the Israelites were returning from Babylon to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple. Zerubbabel, their leader prevails upon King Darius to restore the Holy Vessels to the new Temple. They had been carried away by the Babylonian armies when the first Temple was destroyed. In presenting his plea before the King, the companion gives a powerful testimony to the almighty force of Truth. The ritual places the candidate in the role of Zerubbabel and follows him through his journey to King Darius in Persia and his role in the Immemorial Discussion, as found in the apocryphal book, 1 Esdras. The purpose is to bridge the gap between Royal Arch Masonry and the Chivalric Orders as well as between the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Illustrious Order of the Red Cross teaches the lessons of the triumph of truth. =The Degree of Knight of St Paul (or Mediterranean Pass)= Two downward pointing swords in saltire, symbol of the Order of St Paul. This degree is conferred as a prerequisite to becoming a Knight of Malta, in both the York Rite and independent 'stand-alone' versions of Knight Templar Freemasonry. The \\"Preliminary Declarations\\" of the Order of Malta ritual in England state of a candidate for the Order of Malta: \\"He must also have received the Degree of Knight of St Paul, including the Mediterranean Pass\\". The exact status of the 'Mediterranean Pass' has at times led to confusion as to whether this is the 'stub' of a separate degree. The English ritual book clarified this in its 1989 edition (and subsequent editions) by stating: \\"The Mediterranean Pass is one of the secrets of the Degree of Knight of St Paul\\".Great Priory Ritual No 2, The Ancient & Masonic Order of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes, and Malta (published 1989, London), page 3. This degree is close to being a true 'side degree', in that a small group (usually three) of members of the degree take the candidate \\"to one side\\" (i.e. apart on his own) and simply communicate the secrets of the degree to him, without actually working the ceremonial ritual of the degree. The only respect in which the degree fails to meet the definition of a true 'side degree' is that a Chapter of the Order is formally opened and closed by the presiding officer, on either side of the secrets being communicated. =The Degree of Knight of Malta (Order of Malta)= The Maltese Cross, symbol of the Order of Malta. This degree is universally associated with the Masonic Knights Templar. In the York Rite system it is conferred before the Templar Degree; in the 'stand-alone' tradition it is conferred subsequently to the Templar Degree. It is known by varying degrees of formality as the Order of Malta, or the Order of Knights of Malta, or the Ancient and Masonic Order of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes, and Malta. In practice this last and fullest version of the name tends to be reserved to letterheads, rituals, and formal documents. The ceremony for conferring the degree (which is always worked in full) contains a mixture of masonic tradition, historical accounts of the Order of St John, moral teaching, and the communication of modes of recognition between members. A series of banners is employed in the ceremony, each representing one of the great battles of the historic medieval Order of St John, whose story is the basis of the moral teachings of the degree. The Cross and Crown, symbol of the Order of the Temple as found in the York Rite. =The Degree of Knight of the Temple (Order of the Temple)= The original medieval Order of Knights Templar was established after the First Crusade, and existed from approximately 1118 to 1312. There is no known historical evidence to link the medieval Knights Templar and Masonic Templarism, nor do the Masonic Knights Templar organizations claim any such direct link to the original medieval Templar organization.Knights Templar FAQ/INFO Accessed 14 August 2007 Though it has been said that its affiliation with Masonry is based on texts that indicate persecuted Templars found refuge within the safety of Freemasonry, the order itself states that \\"there is no proof of direct connection between the ancient order and the modern order known today as the Knights Templar.\\"http://www.knightstemplar.org/faq.html#origin [Knights Templar FAQ - Origin] The official motto of the Knights Templar is In Hoc Signo Vinces, the rendition in Latin of the Greek phrase \\"ŒµŒΩ œÑŒøœçœÑ·ø≥ ŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ±\\", en tout≈çi nika, meaning \\"in this [sign] you will conquer\\". The Knight Templar degree is associated with elaborate regalia (costume) the precise detail of which varies between nations. The ritual draws upon the traditions of medieval Knights Templar, using them to impart moral instruction consistent with the biblical teachings of the Christian tradition. Organization In England and Wales, the teachings of the Order of the Red Cross feature in the Red Cross of Babylon which forms part of the Allied Masonic Degrees. The Order of the Red Cross is often considered a compressed version of the Red Cross Degrees or Green Degrees which make up the Order of Knight Masons. The Order of the Red Cross should not be confused with the Red Cross of Constantine. Other Rites =Degrees of the York Rite in the United States= U.S. President Andrew Johnson in a Knights Templar uniform in 1869. Knights Templar Parade on Superior Street, Toledo, Ohio, September 26, 1906 In the United States, a Knights Templar commandery is traditionally the final body that a member joins in the York Rite after the chapter of Royal Arch Masons and a council of Royal & Select Masters. Some jurisdictions, however, allow members to skip over membership in a council. A local Knights Templar commandery operates under a state-level Grand Commandery, however American commanderies also operate under The Grand Encampment of the United States. This is less common among American Masonic bodies, as many report to the state level alone. While a chapter bestows the Royal Arch degrees, and a council bestows the Cryptic degrees, a Knights Templar commandery bestows three orders and one preparatory degree onto its members. This is opposed to the standard degree system found elsewhere in Freemasonry, and they are the only ones not to deal with the Hiramic Legend.http://www.knightstemplar.org/faq.html#member [Knights Templar FAQ - How to Become a Knight Templar] The York Rite orders are: *The Illustrious Order of the Red Cross *The Degree of Saint Paul (or the Mediterranean Pass) *The Order of the Knights of Malta (or simply Order of Malta) *The Order of the Temple =Templar degrees in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite= History and legend concerning the historical Knights Templar also play an important role in the degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, notably in the Rite's 30th Degree, Knight Kadosh. Other Scottish Rite degrees sometimes styled \\"Templar Degrees\\" include the 28th Degree (Knight Commander of the Temple, formerly denominated the 27th Degree in the Southern Jurisdiction of United States), the 29th Degree (Scottish Knight of Saint Andrew), the 32nd Degree (Master of the Royal Secret), and the 33rd Degree (Inspector General).http://www.houstonscottishrite.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/04/Templar-Degrees-of-the-SR-v3.pdf, by Pierre G. Normand, Jr., 33¬∞, retrieved 26 March 2013 =Templar themes in wider Freemasonry= Despite Freemasonry's general disclaimer that no one Masonic organization claims a direct heritage to the medieval Knights Templar, certain degrees and orders are obviously patterned after the medieval Order. These are best described as \\"commemorative orders\\" or degrees. Nevertheless, in spite of the fraternity's official disclaimers, some Masons, non-Masons and even anti- Masons insist that certain Masonic rites or degrees originally had direct Templar influence. * American Masonic youth organizations such as the Order of DeMolay for young men are named after the last Grand Master Templar Jacques de Molay who was executed in the final suppression of the Templar order in the early 14th century. * The Knight of Rose-Croix Degree in the \\"Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite\\", and honorary Orders like the Royal Order of Scotland are interpreted as evidence of a historical Templar-Masonic connection, though there is no factual basis for this belief. * Rosslyn Chapel near Edinburgh has been suggested to be strong link between the Knights Templar and Freemasons due to reliefs combining Templar and Freemason symbolism. Historian Dr. Louise Yeoman, along with other mediaeval scholars, says the Knights Templar connection is false, and points out that Rosslyn Chapel was built by William Sinclair so that Mass could be said for the souls of his family. In addition, Rosslyn Chapel's connection to Freemasonry, as well as to the Templars, has been vigorously disputed by Robert L. D. Cooper, the Curator of the Grand Lodge of Scotland Museum and Library. It is postulated that any existing Masonic imagery was likely added at a later date, probably in the 1860s when James St Clair-Erskine, 3rd Earl of Rosslyn instructed Edinburgh architect David Bryce, a known Freemason, to undertake restoration work on areas of the church including many of the carvings.Michael T R B Turnbull, Rosslyn Chapel Revealed (review and synopsis), Fort Augustus Abbey School Old Boys Association, accessed 8 May 2017 * Legends in certain degrees recount that Knights under the command of Sir John De Bermingham, first and last Earl of Louth, aided Scottish King Robert the Bruce, who had been excommunicated, at the Battle of Bannockburn;Nolan, History Journal, 1988-89 but this account is based on an 18th-century romance and is not supported by any evidence. This story is the basis for the degrees in the Royal Order of Scotland, an invitational Masonic honorary organization. * Templar connections have also been suggested through the Earls of Rosslyn (St. Clair, or Sinclair) a family with well documented connections with Scottish Freemasonry, one being a Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. * Many other old and new organizations are called \\"Knights Templar\\". However, organizations like the Order of the Solar Temple, Militi Templi Scotia, Ordo Templi Orientis, or the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem are in no way related to Masonic Knights Templar, and share little or no relationship with it in history, hierarchy, or ritual.

The formation was located on Yufu Shore (È≠öËÖπÊµ¶) by the Yangtze River near present-day Baidicheng, Chongqing, China, where supposed ruins of the array exist. In folklore, when the Yangtze River rises in summer, the formation is submerged, but in autumn, the array resurfaces, with the rocks and boulders still left intact in their original positions. Lu Xun's encounter The Stone Sentinel Maze was mentioned in Chapter 84 of the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Liu Bei was defeated by Lu Xun at the Battle of Xiaoting and fled towards Baidicheng with Lu Xun in hot pursuit. When Lu Xun arrived at Yufu Shore by the Yangtze River near Baidicheng, he felt a strong enemy presence and cautioned his troops of a possible ambush. He sent men to scout ahead, who reported that the area was deserted except for some scattered piles of rocks. Bewildered, Lu Xun asked a local, who told him that qi started emerging from the area after Zhuge Liang arranged the rocks there when he first entered Sichuan. Lu Xun personally inspected the area and believed that the \\"maze\\" was only a petty display of deception, so he led a few men inside. Just as he was about to leave, a strong gust of wind blew. Dust storms overshadowed the sky and the rocks seemed like swords, mountainous piles of dirt emerged while the river waves sounded like an attacking army. Lu Xun exclaimed, \\"I have fallen into Zhuge Liang's trap!\\", and attempted to escape from the maze but to no avail. Suddenly, Lu Xun saw an old man, who offered him assistance in exiting the labyrinth. Lu Xun followed him and got out of the maze unharmed. The old man identified himself as Huang Chengyan, Zhuge Liang's father-in-law. He explained to Lu Xun that the maze was constructed based on the ba gua concept. Huang Chengyan also told Lu Xun that Zhuge Liang had predicted that a Wu general would chance upon the maze when he first built it, and had asked him not to lead the general out when he fell into the trap. Lu Xun dismounted and thanked Huang Chengyan. When he returned to camp, he exclaimed that he was inferior to Zhuge Liang in terms of intelligence. He then made plans to return to Eastern Wu because he feared that their rival state Cao Wei might take advantage of the situation to attack Wu. =Historicity= No documentation of this event is found in Records of the Three Kingdoms, the authoritative historical text for the history of the Three Kingdoms period. It was mentioned in Lu Xun's biography that after Liu Bei retreated to Baidicheng, the Wu generals Xu Sheng, Pan Zhang, Song Qian and others felt that Liu Bei was within reach and they could capture him, so they kept making requests to Sun Quan to allow them to attack Baidicheng. Sun Quan asked Lu Xun for his opinion, and Lu Xun, along with Zhu Ran and Luo Tong, gave their response, \\"Cao Pi has thousands of troops. He pretends to agree to help us attack (Liu) Bei, but he has other motives. Please make the decision to return (to Wu) soon.\\" Not long later, as Lu Xun expected, Cao Wei forces came to attack Eastern Wu from three directions, which would trigger a series of battles between Wei and Wu between 222 and 225.(ÂèàÂÇôÊó¢‰ΩèÁôΩÂ∏ùÔºåÂæêÁõõ„ÄÅÊΩòÁíã„ÄÅÂÆãË¨ôÁ≠âÂêÑÁ´∂Ë°®Ë®ÄÂÇôÂøÖÂèØÁ¶ΩÔºå‰πûÂæ©Êîª‰πã„ÄÇÊ¨ä‰ª•ÂïèÈÅúÔºåÈÅúËàáÊú±ÁÑ∂„ÄÅÈß±Áµ±‰ª•ÁÇ∫\\"Êõπ‰∏ïÂ§ßÂêàÂ£´Áúæ„ÄÇÂ§ñÊâòÂä©ÂúãË®éÂÇôÔºåÂÖßÂØ¶ÊúâÂ•∏ÂøÉÔºåË¨πÊ±∫Ë®àËºíÈÇÑ\\"„ÄÇÁÑ°ÂπæÔºåÈ≠èËªçÊûúÂá∫Ôºå‰∏âÊñπÂèóÊïµ‰πü„ÄÇ) Chen Shou.

Through the guidance of an old man, Zhang Xianzhong led his troops into the maze and out. The pursuing imperial forces charged into the array. Suddenly, mist shrouded the area and the piles of dirt appeared to be hills and valleys. The imperial soldiers exhausted themselves over the night by attempting to escape but only at daybreak did they realize that they were actually charging at piles of dirt.

Review/Theater; Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread\\" The New York Times, February 4, 1990 It was next performed as part of six short plays, collectively titled All in the Timing Off-Broadway at Primary Stages in 1993, and revived in 2013.Hetrick, Adam. \\"Primary Stages Revival of David Ives' 'All in the Timing' Ends Off-Broadway Run April 28\\" playbill.com, 28 Apr 2013 Ives described the play: \\"Each one of these little plays were a little education in some particular aspect of theatre....

The structure of this piece is closest to a rap or musical number, but it is quite distinct from both. The beat is alternately very fast and very ponderous. Einstein on the Beach, the 5-hour Glassian opera, is said by some to provide a good model of such rhythms that are seen in the play. The play opens and closes completely normally‚Äî\\"Philip Glass\\" enters a bakery, where in passing he encounters an old love of his accompanied by a friend.Guernsey, Otis L. and Sweet, Jeffrey. All in the Timing The Best Plays of 1993-1994, Hal Leonard Corporation, 1994, , pp. 295-296 Between the two ends of this scene, in a long section marked by the ringing of a bell (a recurring device in Ives' plays), come rhythmic reorderings of the words used in the opening and closing. Some of the phrases make little sense (\\"PHILIP CAN THINK BREAD\\"), but they are used to create an emotional atmosphere suggesting Philip's subconscious state at seeing this woman again. Other lines are understandable but absurd, such as \\"PHILIP GLASS IS A LOAF OF BREAD\\" and \\"PHILIP NEED A LOAF OF LOVE,\\" while others still make philosophical sense, such as \\"TIME IS A MOMENT.\\" The play suggests several themes (although none of them too seriously) including the tendency of real life (the Baker) to interrupt what we wish life to be (Philip Glass and his old love). It seems that whenever Philip Glass or the rest of the cast comes close to a philosophical revelation, they revert to trochaic, nonsensical rhythms such as \\"Go! Go! Go! Go! Time! Time! Time! Time!\\" The bread can also be seen as a symbol of Philip's life and happiness, which he tries to ask for several times in vain. The Baker also needs \\"bread\\" in his life, whatever that may be for him... even money (\\"bread\\"). None of the messages are to be taken entirely seriously, as noted in the original \\"sheet music\\" of the piece. Philip Glass... may be distinguished from most of Ives' other works in that its ending may be played either comedically or dramatically, depending on the production. Of all of Ives' works, it is certainly the most open to directors' interpretation and thus stagings of it vary wildly. While some productions might choose to increase the absurdity of the parody until climactic breaking point, others may choose to twist the rhythm towards the end to allow for the few dramatic revelations allowed in the piece, such as \\"WHAT'S THE WOMAN MATTER?\\" and the final line of the musical interlude, \\"NEED NOTHING NEED WOMAN NEED MATTER. NO CHANGE.\\" Nevertheless, the piece almost invariably ends on a laugh, as Glass asks if the baker can break his bill and the baker points to a sign stating, \\"No Change.\\" (In some productions, there is no sign, and this is merely implied or else spoken outright.)

Early life and career  Born in Ireland, purportedly in Armagh, Honeyman was of Scottish descent. The son of a poor farmer, he received little formal education but was nevertheless literate and learned several trades, including weaving. He worked as a farmer until the age of 29 and then entered the British Army to fight in the French and Indian War in 1758. He sailed to Canada aboard the frigate Boyne on which Colonel James Wolfe was also embarked. One day during the Atlantic Ocean crossing, Honeyman was on watch on the deck when Wolfe, who was about to descend a stairway, tripped and would have surely fallen if he had not been caught by Honeyman. Wolfe showed his gratitude by taking down Honeyman's name and promising to look out for the young private. Upon landing off the Saint Lawrence River, Honeyman's unit was almost immediately put into action against the French during the Siege of Louisbourg which ended after 48 days on July 26, 1758. Wolfe, who served under General Jeffery Amherst, was shortly promoted to General. He remembered the young private who saved him aboard the Boyne and made him his bodyguard, with orders to remain with him at all times. The success of the siege cleared the way for the British expedition led by General Wolfe to take New France at Quebec City the following summer and which culminated in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on September 13, 1759. While it ended with a British victory, Wolfe was fatally shot and Honeyman was among those who carried the General down the heights to his shelter, where he died. Some people believe that one of the three men surrounding Wolfe in the painting La Morte de Wolfe by Benjamim West at the McCord Museum in Montreal is John Honeyman. After the war, Honeyman was given an honorable discharge from the army and he settled in Pennsylvania, carrying with him his discharge papers as well as a letter from General Wolfe requesting his services as his bodyguard. He took up his trade as a butcher and weaver and he married the former Mary Henry, an Irish girl from Coleraine at the First Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia on September 22, 1764.  In service as Washington's spy  Griggstown Sometime before 1775, Honeyman moved to Philadelphia and supposedly met George Washington who was attending meetings of the Continental Congress. Although Honeyman had served the British well during the French and Indian War, he was sympathetic to the American cause and promptly presented his services to Washington. Washington, astute at finding good talent, accepted Honeyman's services. In the early part of 1776, Honeyman moved with his family to Griggstown, in Somerset County, New Jersey. It is unknown, however, whether this move was a result of his meetings with Washington. When Washington's Continental Army was retreating across New Jersey in 1776, Washington wanted to \\"get some person into Trenton\\" as an agent. He called upon Honeyman for a meeting at Fort Lee, New Jersey in November and there, Honeyman agreed that he would act the part of a spy for the American cause in that part of New Jersey where he was most familiar. Washington told Honeyman to use the cover of a Tory. The fact that he served under Wolfe, as proven by his discharge papers as well as Wolfe's letter requesting his services as his bodyguard, guaranteed his acceptance by the enemy garrison in Trenton. Posing as a Tory, Honeyman, continuing his trade as a butcher and weaver, commenced his trade with the British. He was instructed to continue trading as much as possible behind the American lines in Griggstown and, if necessary, to flee to Trenton on the pretext of the danger posed to his family due to his double-dealing. The deceptive plan was so believable that a mob of angry American patriots raided Honeyman's house in Griggstown. Fortunately, his family were saved from certain harm by a signed letter from Washington guaranteeing its safety, but nevertheless calling Honeyman \\"a notorious Tory\\". His credibility as a Tory now well-established, he moved to Trenton where his trade enabled him to move freely within the town and gather intelligence about the garrison. Having amassed enough information, he arranged to be captured by the Continental forces, who had been ordered to watch for him and bring him straight to Washington unharmed. After receiving the information Honeyman had gathered, Washington ordered the guards to feed the \\"Tory\\" and lock him up in a small hut used as a prison. Shortly afterward, a fire broke out in the vicinity providing an opportunity for Honeyman to \\"escape\\". Making his way back to Trenton, he told the Hessian commander, Colonel Johann Rall, of his capture and reported that the Continental Army was in such a low state of morale that they would not attack Trenton. Even though the Hessians had been on heightened alert for the past two weeks, they believed Honeyman's story and so felt confident enough to relax security on December 26. In the meantime, Honeyman made his way to New Brunswick, New Jersey. On the night of December 25‚Äì26, 1776, with 2,400 troops, Washington made the well known crossing of the Delaware River from Pennsylvania to New Jersey north of Trenton. The next morning, the Continental forces surprised the Hessians in a rout, giving the Americans a much-needed victory at the Battle of Trenton. With Washington, Honeyman had arranged for his mission to be confined in New Jersey and since the British were driven from the colony in 1777 his services were little needed, if at all. It had further been agreed upon, however, that Honeyman would continue to maintain his cover as a Tory to prevent any reprisals by the British against him and his family until the end of the war. As a consequence, he did not return to Griggstown until after hostilities ended four years later.  Later years  By 1793, Honeyman removed to Bedminster, New Jersey, in upper Somerset County. He bought several parcels of land between 1793 and 1797 and spent the last 30 years of his life there. His wife, Mary, died on June 24, 1801, and three years later, he married a widow, Elizabeth Estel-Burrows. He died on August 18, 1822 at the age of 93 and is buried in the Lamington Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Lamington, New Jersey.  Fact or Legend?  The role Honeyman played in the Revolutionary War has been debated for some time. The first written record of his involvement with Washington appears to be his grandson Judge John Van Dyke's \\"An Unwritten Account of a Spy of Washington,\\" which appeared in Our Home magazine in 1873, nearly 100 years later. Van Dyke is said to have relied on details he got from one of Honeyman's daughters, Van Dyke's Aunt Jane Honeyman who died in 1836. Judge Van Dyke's son, John Charles Van Dyke, the author of The Desert, added that \\"documents discovered in the Secretary of State's office at Trenton go to confirm it,\\" without identifying the documents further. In his autobiography, John C. Van Dyke also wrote, \\"My father was much with him (Honeyman) in his later years, and he had fragments of the story from the spy's own lips, but the spy was never very communicative.\\" Doubters point to the lack of direct evidence to support the spy story including the fact that the letter from Washington that protected the Honeyman family has never been seen outside the family. Some find it odd that a document of such apparent historic value has never surfaced publicly. Author Alexander Rose notes that \\"not once is John Honeyman mentioned in Washington's voluminous correspondence and papers\\" and that \\"upon meeting Honeyman, a veteran of the British army, Washington would have been more likely to recruit him as a sergeant than as a spy.\\" Supporters argue that the lack of direct evidence merely points to the excellent job Honeyman, and Washington, did concealing his actions as a spy. Some have offered circumstantial evidence to support the spy story. Historians have pointed out that several legal actions brought against Honeyman for being a Tory appear to have been dismissed. Honeyman even sought compensation for losses he suffered during the war, something that a Tory would not have considered. While other Tories were forced to flee to Nova Scotia after the war, Honeyman remained in New Jersey. In fact, it is known that Honeyman purchased several tracts of land after the war, which raises the question of how a simple weaver with a rather large family could afford to make these purchases without some special income. John C. Van Dyke records that Honeyman \\"had always been considered a poor man, and his neighbors were much surprised when he died leaving about twelve thousand dollars. That was a large sum in those days....\\" That is evidence, to some, that he received compensation for his role in the war.

It is a special case of the more generally stated principle of least action. Using the calculus of variations, it results in an integral equation formulation of the equations of motion for the system. Mathematical formulation Maupertuis's principle states that the true path of a system described by N generalized coordinates \\\\mathbf{q} = \\\\left( q_{1}, q_{2}, \\\\ldots, q_{N} \\\\right) between two specified states \\\\mathbf{q}_{1} and \\\\mathbf{q}_{2} is a stationary point (i.e., an extremum (minimum or maximum) or a saddle point) of the abbreviated action functional : \\\\mathcal{S}_{0}[\\\\mathbf{q}(t)] \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\int \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{q} where \\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\left( p_{1}, p_{2}, \\\\ldots, p_{N} \\\\right) are the conjugate momenta of the generalized coordinates, defined by the equation : p_{k} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial\\\\dot{q}_{k}} where L(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}},t) is the Lagrangian function for the system. In other words, any first-order perturbation of the path results in (at most) second-order changes in \\\\mathcal{S}_{0}. Note that the abbreviated action \\\\mathcal{S}_{0} is a functional (i.e. a function from a vector space into its underlying scalar field), which in this case takes as its input a function (i.e. the paths between the two specified states). Jacobi's formulation For many systems, the kinetic energy T is quadratic in the generalized velocities \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}} : T = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\ \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}}^\\\\intercal although the mass tensor \\\\mathbf{M} may be a complicated function of the generalized coordinates \\\\mathbf{q}. For such systems, a simple relation relates the kinetic energy, the generalized momenta and the generalized velocities : 2 T = \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}} provided that the potential energy V(\\\\mathbf{q}) does not involve the generalized velocities. By defining a normalized distance or metric ds in the space of generalized coordinates : ds^{2} = d\\\\mathbf{q} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\ d\\\\mathbf{q^\\\\intercal} one may immediately recognize the mass tensor as a metric tensor. The kinetic energy may be written in a massless form : T = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ds}{dt} \\\\right)^{2} or, : 2 T dt = \\\\sqrt{2 T} \\\\ ds. Therefore, the abbreviated action can be written : \\\\mathcal{S}_0 \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\int \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{q} = \\\\int ds \\\\, \\\\sqrt{2}\\\\sqrt{E_\\\\text{tot} - V(\\\\mathbf{q})} since the kinetic energy T = E_\\\\text{tot} - V(\\\\mathbf{q}) equals the (constant) total energy E_\\\\text{tot} minus the potential energy V(\\\\mathbf{q}). In particular, if the potential energy is a constant, then Jacobi's principle reduces to minimizing the path length s = \\\\int ds in the space of the generalized coordinates, which is equivalent to Hertz's principle of least curvature. Comparison with Hamilton's principle Hamilton's principle and Maupertuis's principle are occasionally confused and both have been called the principle of least action. They differ from each other in three important ways: * their definition of the action... :::Hamilton's principle uses \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\int L \\\\, dt, the integral of the Lagrangian over time, varied between two fixed end times t_{1}, t_{2} and endpoints q_1, q_2. By contrast, Maupertuis's principle uses the abbreviated action integral over the generalized coordinates, varied along all constant energy paths ending at q_1 and q_2. *the solution that they determine... :::Hamilton's principle determines the trajectory \\\\mathbf{q}(t) as a function of time, whereas Maupertuis's principle determines only the shape of the trajectory in the generalized coordinates. For example, Maupertuis's principle determines the shape of the ellipse on which a particle moves under the influence of an inverse-square central force such as gravity, but does not describe per se how the particle moves along that trajectory. (However, this time parameterization may be determined from the trajectory itself in subsequent calculations using the conservation of energy.) By contrast, Hamilton's principle directly specifies the motion along the ellipse as a function of time. *...and the constraints on the variation. :::Maupertuis's principle requires that the two endpoint states q_{1} and q_{2} be given and that energy be conserved along every trajectory. By contrast, Hamilton's principle does not require the conservation of energy, but does require that the endpoint times t_{1} and t_{2} be specified as well as the endpoint states q_{1} and q_{2}. History Maupertuis was the first to publish a principle of least action, where he defined action as \\\\int v \\\\, ds, which was to be minimized over all paths connecting two specified points. However, Maupertuis applied the principle only to light, not matter (see the 1744 Maupertuis reference below). He arrived at the principle by considering Snell's law for the refraction of light, which Fermat had explained by Fermat's principle, that light follows the path of shortest time, not distance. This troubled Maupertuis, since he felt that time and distance should be on an equal footing: \\"why should light prefer the path of shortest time over that of distance?\\" Accordingly, Maupertuis asserts with no further justification the principle of least action as equivalent but more fundamental than Fermat's principle, and uses it to derive Snell's law. Maupertuis specifically states that light does not follow the same laws as material objects. A few months later, well before Maupertuis's work appeared in print, Leonhard Euler independently defined action in its modern abbreviated form \\\\mathcal{S}_{0} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\int m v \\\\, ds \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\int p \\\\, dq and applied it to the motion of a particle, but not to light (see the 1744 Euler reference below). Euler also recognized that the principle only held when the speed was a function only of position, i.e., when the total energy was conserved. (The mass factor in the action and the requirement for energy conservation were not relevant to Maupertuis, who was concerned only with light.) Euler used this principle to derive the equations of motion of a particle in uniform motion, in a uniform and non-uniform force field, and in a central force field. Euler's approach is entirely consistent with the modern understanding of Maupertuis's principle described above, except that he insisted that the action should always be a minimum, rather than a stationary point. Two years later, Maupertuis cites Euler's 1744 work as a \\"beautiful application of my principle to the motion of the planets\\" and goes on to apply the principle of least action to the lever problem in mechanical equilibrium and to perfectly elastic and perfectly inelastic collisions (see the 1746 publication below). Thus, Maupertuis takes credit for conceiving the principle of least action as a general principle applicable to all physical systems (not merely to light), whereas the historical evidence suggests that Euler was the one to make this intuitive leap. Notably, Maupertuis's definitions of the action and protocols for minimizing it in this paper are inconsistent with the modern approach described above. Thus, Maupertuis's published work does not contain a single example in which he used Maupertuis's principle (as presently understood). In 1751, Maupertuis's priority for the principle of least action was challenged in print (Nova Acta Eruditorum of Leipzig) by an old acquaintance, Johann Samuel Koenig, who quoted a 1707 letter purportedly from Leibniz that described results similar to those derived by Euler in 1744. However, Maupertuis and others demanded that Koenig produce the original of the letter to authenticate its having been written by Leibniz. Koenig only had a copy and no clue as to the whereabouts of the original. Consequently, the Berlin Academy under Euler's direction declared the letter to be a forgery and that its President, Maupertuis, could continue to claim priority for having invented the principle. Koenig continued to fight for Leibniz's priority and soon luminaries such as Voltaire and the King of Prussia, Frederick II were engaged in the quarrel. However, no progress was made until the turn of the twentieth century, when other independent copies of Leibniz's letter were discovered.

With an average total length of about , it is the smallest parrot in Australia. Most subspecies of the double-eyed fig parrot are sexually dimorphic, with males having more red (less silvery and blue) to the face than the females. It is predominantly green with a very short tail, a disproportionately large head and bill, and red and blue facial markings. Its name is derived from the cheek patches of some subspecies that vaguely resemble eyes. Although assessed as of Least Concern by the IUCN, certain subspecies are under threat. Coxen's fig parrot (C. d. coxeni) is of one Australia's rarest and least known birds, having been recorded on fewer than 200 occasions since being described by Gould in 1866. It is classified as Endangered in Queensland (Nature Conservation Act 1992), New South Wales (New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995), and also nationally in Australia (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999) as it has declined due, at least in part, to the clearing of lowland subtropical rainforest over its range. Behaviour The double-eyed fig parrot generally forages for figs, berries, seeds, nectar, and the grubs of wood-boring insects. This foraging is done in pairs or in a flock of only a few individuals. It tends to fly in a quick and direct manner. It produces a short and shrill call. Unlike many other parrots which generally use existing holes in trees for nests, double-eyed fig parrots excavate their own nest cavities, usually in a rotten tree. Double-eyed fig parrots utter high-pitched, clipped, two or three note zzzt-zzzt or zeet-zeet calls, unlike the rolling or trilling screeches typical of lorikeets. These calls are mostly made in flight, but sometimes when perched. When engrossed in feeding, it may also make a variety of softer, chattering noises. Eight subspecies of the double-eyed fig parrot are described. The first five are restricted to New Guinea and associated islands; the last three are restricted to Australia.

She competed for Team Canada in biathlon at the 2006, 2010, 2014 Winter Olympics and in 12 editions of the Biathlon World Championships. Career Kocher started out competing as a cross- country skier, and was introduced to the sport of biathlon at the 1998 Alberta Winter Games. After graduating from high school in 2000, she moved to Canmore to train full-time. She subsequently was selected to compete for Canada at the 2001 Junior World Championships, before embarking on her first full-time Biathlon World Cup campaign in the 2003-04 season, during which she took five top 30 finishes. In the opening race of the 2006-07 season, a 15 km individual competition in √ñstersund, Sweden, Kocher finished third, becoming the first Canadian biathlete to make the podium in a top-level international event since Myriam B√©dard ten years earlier. After a two year period where she struggled with illness, Kocher took a fourth place in a pursuit at the third meeting of the 2009-10 season in Pokljuka, Slovenia, shooting 20 out of 20 targets in an event for the first time, having already taken a tenth place in the sprint at the same meeting. At the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, she was part of the Canadian team that finished eighth in the women's relay, the best ever Canadian finish in that event. Kocher retired from biathlon competition in March 2016, and by January 2017 she had enrolled as a student of massage therapy at Mount Royal University. She subsequently competed in the 2017 national cross-country ski championships in Canmore: having trained on a part- time basis, she won the 5 km competition and finished second in the 30 km event, in a field containing members of the Canadian national cross-country ski team. She subsequently decided to switch to part-time studies and return to competition as a cross-country skier with the aim of being selected for the 2018 Winter Olympics, partly in memory of Richard Boruta, her former biathlon coach, who had been killed in a climbing accident in August 2017. Kocher won the 51 km freestyle race at the Gatineau Loppet in February 2018.  Bold Beautiful Biathlon  She was part of a group of five athletes (along with Canadian biathletes Megan Tandy, Sandra Keith, Rosanna Crawford, and Megan Imrie), who posed for the Bold Beautiful Biathlon calendar. Although Zina Kocher was one of the few fully funded athletes in the national biathlon program, she took the initiative to find opportunities for extra funding. Kocher felt the calendar would build a new image for young Canadian girls to look up to; the image of a healthy, athletic body. The nude photos were taken by Rachel Boekel and Adrian Marcoux in Canmore, Alberta. The concept was that each athlete will be featured on two pages of the calendar, and there will be four group photos. The calendar was called Bold Beautiful Biathlon, and sold for $25. The biathletes were inspired by a calendar that was done featuring Olympic cross-country skiers, Sara Renner and Beckie Scott in 2001.

He is married to Emma Biggs, with whom he collaborates on art works. Education Born in London in 1955, Collings studied at Byam Shaw School of Art, and Goldsmith's College, both in London. Life and career He began his career working at Artscribe first in the production department in 1979 and later taking over as editor, filling that role from 1983-7, bringing international relevance to the magazine. In 1987 he received a Turner Prize commendation for his work on Artscribe. Collings later moved into television working as a producer and presenter on the BBC The Late Show from 1989-95. In the early 1990s he brought Martin Kippenberger into the BBC studios to create an installation, and he interviewed Georg Herold while this Cologne-based conceptual artist painted a large canvas with beluga caviar. He gave Jeff Koons his first sympathetic exposure on British TV, and Damien Hirst was also introduced for the first time to the UK TV audience by Collings. He wrote and presented documentary films for the BBC on individual artists, such as Donald Judd, Georgia O'Keeffe and Willem de Kooning, as well as broader historical subjects such as Hitler's \\"Degenerate art\\" exhibition, art looted in the Second World War by Germany and Russia, Situationism, Spain's post-Franco art world and the rise of the Cologne art scene. After leaving the BBC, Collings wrote 'Blimey! From Bohemia to Britpop: The London Artworld from Francis Bacon to Damien Hirst,' which humorously chronicled the rise of the Young British Art (YBA) movement. Published in 1997 by 21, a new company founded by David Bowie, among a group of others, 'Blimey!'was described by Artforum magazine as ‚Äú‚Ä¶one of the best-selling contemporary-art books ever.\\" (Kate Bush on the YBA Sensation, Artforum, 2004) The article went on to say that Collings \\"invented the perfect voice to complement YBA: He makes an impact without (crucially) ever appearing to try too hard.\\" The following year, Collings wrote and presented the Channel 4 TV series This is Modern Art, which won him a Bafta (2000) among other awards. Collings wrote and presented a Channel 4 series in 2003 about the \\"painterly\\" stream of Old Master painting, called Matt's Old Masters. A book by the same title accompanied the series. Further Channel 4 series by Collings included Impressionism: Revenge of the Nice (2004) and The Me Generations: Self Portraits, (2005). Between 1997 and 2005, Collings presented the Channel 4 TV programme on the Turner Prize. In 2007 he wrote and presented the Channel 4 TV series This is Civilisation.This is Civilisation In 2009 he appeared on the BBC2 programme \\"School of Saatchi\\" a reality TV show for newly trained UK artists. In October 2010, he wrote and presented a BBC2 series called Renaissance Revolution, in which he discussed three Renaissance paintings: Raphael's Madonna del Prato; Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights; and Piero della Francesca's The Baptism of Christ. In 2014 he wrote and presented a 90-minute documentary for BBC4 on abstract art: The Rules of Abstraction considered early modernist beginnings by Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Hilma af Klint, and others, as well as contemporary continuities, ranging from Fiona Rae to El Anatsui. In the same year, Collings appeared in Frederick Wiseman's documentary, National Gallery composing and rehearsing a piece-to-camera on Turner's The Fighting Temeraire, for the documentary Turner's Thames, (2012), which Collings wrote and presented for BBC4. Since 2015, he has been the regular art critic for the Evening Standard, replacing Brian Sewell, who died that year.  Suspension from Labour Party  In 2019 Collings was picked as Parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party for the South West Norfolk constituency, but was suspended by the party a day later. With Emma Biggs In October 2007, with his wife, Emma Biggs, Collings has curated many art exhibitions. These include an exhibition of Picasso's late works at the HN Gallery in London. The paintings were from the 1960s series of Painter and Model and D√©jeuner sur l‚Äôherbe reworkings. According to the catalogue essay, written by Collings, the exhibition aimed to draw attention to Picasso's achievement as a manipulator of form rather than the popular myth of Picasso as a showman or lover or sensationalist genius. Together Biggs and Collings create paintings based on intricate patterns. They have exhibited their work in London and abroad.

F. Klaveness & Co of Sandefjord. The ship was primarily employed as an ore and coal carrier doing tramp trade during her career. She is best known for accidentally ramming and sinking the ocean liner RMS Empress of Ireland in 1914, killing over 1,000 people. Design and Construction Storstad was laid down at Armstrong, Whitworth & Co Low Walker shipyard in Newcastle and launched on 4 October 1910 (yard number 824). As the ship was being launched, she struck a nearby steamship SS Dardania from Trieste, and had her stern damaged. After successful completion of sea trials, during which the vessel was able to reach speed of , Storstad was handed over to her owners and fully commissioned in January 1911. To operate the vessel, she was transferred to a separate company, Aktieselskabet \\"Maritim\\", owned by A. F. Klaveness. The ship was built on the Isherwood longitudinal framing principle, and at the time of her launch was the largest vessel to be constructed in this manner. The ship was specifically designed for coal and iron ore carriage, and had very large hatches built, with 10 powerful winches installed for quick cargo discharge. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . Storstad was assessed at , and 10,650 DWT. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 447 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history Upon delivery, Storstad departed on January 31, 1911 for her maiden voyage from Newcastle for Narvik and arrived there on February 4. The vessel loaded 9,609 tons of iron ore and sailed for Philadelphia on February 11 reaching it on March 7. At the time, this was the largest cargo of iron ore unloaded in Philadelphia from a single ship. Storstad then proceeded to Jacksonville where she took on 6,500 tons of phosphate rock on March 17, then continued on to Savannah and loaded 8,071 bales of cotton and departed for Hamburg on March 28. Upon return from Europe on May 20, 1911 the ship was chartered to transport iron ore and coal from Wabana and North Sydney to Montreal and other ports along St. Lawrence River through the end of navigational season in late November. In November 1911 the vessel was chartered for one trip to South America by the Barber Line. Storstad left New York on December 3, 1911 and arrived in Buenos Aires on December 30, after a call at Montevideo. She then continued on to Rosario and from there sailed out back to New York. Upon arrival, the vessel was chartered by the Lamport & Holt Line for one trip to Manchester. Storstad loaded general cargo, including 1,900 bales of cotton and some food supplies, including cottonseed oil, lard and bacon, and left New York on April 21, 1912. The ship arrived in Liverpool on May 4 and upon discharging her cargo, sailed back to North America to resume her iron ore and coal trade in Canada. After the end of navigational season in December 1912, Storstad was chartered by Gans Steamship Line and sailed to Tampa Bay, loaded 3,213 tons of phosphate pebble and then sailed to Port Eads, arriving there on December 20. The ship took on more cargo and then sailed for Antwerp arriving there on January 22, 1913. During her journey Storstad encountered some rough weather, and arrived in port with damage about her decks, including washed overboard portion of the deckload, and some deck equipment and covers. Her No. 5 hold was also full of water. The ship arrived in Philadelphia on February 28 with iron ore from Narvik and after unloading continued to Florida. Storstad loaded 5,600 tons of phosphate pebble on March 19 at Boca Grande, then continued to Galveston where she took on 13,097 bales of cotton and departed for Hamburg on March 25. After finishing her European charter, the ship returned to her usual Canadian trade in May 1913. Upon fulfillment of her summer obligations, Storstad arrived at Norfolk on December 20, 1913 to load a cargo of grain bound for Italy. The vessel left on December 26 for Genoa, which she reached on January 16, 1914. On her return journey, the ship sailed via Roses and Lisbon and arrived at Philadelphia on March 5 with a cargo of cork. Upon unloading, Storstad sailed for Norfolk where she loaded 9,700 tons of coal plus 1,100 tons in bunkers and departed for Venice on March 20. The vessel arrived in Italy on April 10, and upon discharging her cargo departed for Sydney arriving there on May 12, 1914. The vessel was chartered by the Dominion Coal Company to transport coal between Sydney and Montreal for the duration of summer navigational season. =Empress of Ireland disaster= On May 28, 1914 at 16:27 RMS Empress of Ireland, commanded by Captain Henry Kendall, departed from Quebec City with 1,057 passengers and 420 crew members on board bound for Liverpool. At around 01:30 on May 29 the liner, being just downstream of Rimouski came close to the shore to drop off her pilot near Father Point, and continued down the Saint Lawrence River. At the same time, Storstad who sailed from Sydney to Quebec loaded with about 10,400 tons of coal on May 26, was a short distance away down the river on her way to pick up the pilot. At around 01:38 a lookout on Empress of Ireland observed a ship off the starboard side about six miles east. Captain Kendall ordered to alter the course slightly in order to pass the oncoming ship starboard to starboard. As the course was changed, a thick fog bank rolled in and the liner was ordered Full Astern and three short blasts were given indicating she was reversing. Storstad replied with one long whistle which appeared to be coming from the starboard side. Damage sustained by the SS Storstad after her collision with the RMS Empress of Ireland. He then ordered Full Stop and gave two more blasts, informing the oncoming vessel that Empress of Ireland was dead in the water, Storstad, with First Officer Alfred Toftenes on duty, again responded with one long blast. The watch crew on Storstad initially observed the liner green light on their port side and assumed she would continue to hold her course and pass green-to-green. However, as the liner approached, the freighter's crew sighted the lights moving as if the oncoming ship was making a maneuver changing her course. First Officer Toftenes assumed the oncoming ship was trying to pass them red-to-red instead, and ordered a slight change of course to port and stopped the engines. Fearing the current would carry his ship into the liner's path he soon ordered the engines to be restarted. Around 01:55 Empress of Ireland crew suddenly saw Storstad appear out of the fog, heading directly for them. Moments later, Storstad and Empress of Ireland collided at around a 40¬∞ angle, with the much sturdier Storstad tearing a roughly 16-ft. wide gash in the liner's starboard side between her funnels and immediately shutting down the liner's engines. Captain Kendall, hoping to use Storstad as a plug, directed the freighter by megaphone to keep going Full Ahead, but due to her onward momentum and the strong current, Empress of Ireland kept slowly moving forward, while Storstad started drifting sideways and backwards, and the two vessels soon separated. As the ships moved apart, the water gushed in at a rate of about 60,000 gallons per second, quickly filling the liner, whose watertight doors were not closed. Fourteen minutes later, Empress of Ireland sank to the riverbed, taking 1,012 people down with her. Due to the rapidity of the sinking, only 7 lifeboats were lowered from the liner. Storstad stood by and assisted the survivors, lowering her own lifeboats and pulling 485 people from the ice cold waters of the river. Twenty of them would later die from hypothermia on board the freighter. Another steamship, SS Lady Evelyn, came by later to help with the rescue and took the survivors to Rimouski. Storstad had her bow smashed in and twisted but managed to limp into the port of Montreal where she was detained. \\"Official Statement Defending the Storstad Says She Had Right of Way and Tried to Avoid Collision,\\" The New York Times, 1 June 1914.

Anemospilia()is the archaeological site of an ancient Minoan temple on Crete. Geography The temple is located on the northern end of Mount Juktas. Modern Heraklion can be seen from the site. The site is in the country side near Arkhanes, about 7 kilometers from Knossos on the Island of Crete. It was on a hillside facing north towards the palace complexes of Knossos. Various factors made archaeologists conclude that it was a temple. The site is in the countryside, Anemospilia means 'caves of the wind'. It is in the foothills of Mount Juktas, the legendary burial place of Zeus. Archaeology Anemospilia was first excavated in 1979 by the Greek archaeologist Yannis Sakellarakis. The temple was destroyed by earthquake and fire around 1700 BC, about the same time as the destruction of the first palaces. The temple was found in a ruined state with stone walls only reaching hip height. Traces of ash and charcoal were found on the ground, and from this, one can postulate that the building was burnt down. Finds excavated from Anemospilia are at the Heraklion Archaeological Museum. The temple is set out with three chambers and one annex that leads into them, each chamber has something somewhat unusual about them inside it. = East chamber = In the east chamber, ruins of a stepped altar were found on the Southside of the room, and on it were many offerings. There were the remains of many vessels of pottery (pithoi) found on the floor, and traces of milk, honey, grains, and peas were found in the bottom of the jars. When the pottery vessels were reconstructed, the scene carved into some of the pottery shows a religious ritual. = Annex = In the annex, a body was found, whose bones were so smashed, especially the pelvic bones, that it was impossible for anyone to identify the gender of the body, showing that the corpse had a boulder or rock dropped onto it. Around the body were fragments of smashed pottery. The position of the body indicates that the person was running from the central chamber at the time of death. = Central chamber = In the central chamber, an altar of the south side of the room was found, made from the hewn rock of the sacred hillside. On it stood a pair of clay feet that had been the idol's base, as well as bits of burnt wood. The idol, or Xoanon (Greek for statue), would have been life-sized and predominantly made of wood, and the ash on the ground suggests that it was burned when the temple was. At the base of the altar were found the remains of more than 400 pottery vessels. Close to the Xoanon there was a mound, a piece of hillside rock, a symbol of the earth, which, along with the sea and the sky, the Minoans considered to be the eternal elements of the world. The sacred stone had been an important part in rituals, for over it libations were poured to the deity. = Western chamber = In the western chamber, two skeletons were found on the floor, one in the south west corner of the room This body was of a 28-year-old female; because the average life expectancy in ancient civilisations was around 55, she would have been a middle aged woman. She could have been a high priestess of some sort. The other skeleton was that of a male, he was aged in his late thirties, and 183 cm tall, and powerfully built, he was lying on his back with his hands covering his face, as if to protect it. The tall man had a ring made of iron and silver on the little finger of his left hand and on his wrist was an engraved seal of ‚Äúexceptional artistic merit‚Äù, this would have obviously been very valuable. His legs were broken and his body was found near the centre of the room next to a platform, at the base of the platform was a trough. On top of the platform another body was found. This was a body of an 18-year-old male; he was found in the foetal position, lying on his right side. Amongst the bones was found an ornately engraved knife, it was 40 cm long and weighing more than 400g. Each side of the blade had an incised rendering of an animal head, the snout and tusks of a boar, ears like butterfly wings and slanted eyes like a fox. His legs were forced back so that his heels were almost touching his thigh, indicating that they were tied there. = Debate over human sacrifice = Although many still believe that there is substantial evidence for the site being used for the sacrificing of humans, some archaeologists follow the thinking of Dennis Hughes, who points out that the \\"knife\\" is actually much more like an ornate spear head that probably fell from the shelves above onto the body, and that there is no evidence at all for the platform that he lies on being an altar. According to Professor J. Leslie Fritton, in her book \\"Minoans\\" (pp.104-5):\\"The evidence from Anemospilia seems clearly to indicate a human sacrifice, and modern unwillingness to suggest such practices must be left to one side.\\" References * Swindale, Ian \\"Anemospilia\\" Retrieved 11 February 2006 Further reading * Sakellarakis, J. and E.

The dart would typically consist of a heavy metal point approximately long, attached to a shaft of wood, typically long, and fletched with feathers or similar materials to provide stability of flight. History The kestros is mentioned in the writings of Livy and Polybius. It seems to have been invented around 168 BC. and was employed by some of the Macedonian troops of King Perseus during the Third Macedonian war. The description is quite confusing: The exact construction of the kestrosphendone remains somewhat mysterious. However, experimental reconstructions based on the available information have resulted in quite spectacular results. Nonetheless, the kestrosphendone did not stand the test of time and seems to have been abandoned quite quickly. The fundamental purpose of this weapon seems to have been to develop a sling shot with the penetrative power of a point. If so, then a lighter version of this weapon, the plumbata, persisted into late antiquity. In this weapon, the wooden shaft gave nearly the same mechanical advantage as a sling. In effect, each sling bolt came with a one-time sling. Another way of obtaining a one time sling was to fix a string to a slingstone made of lead. There is evidence for this variation at the Battle of Fucine Lake in 89 BC.

Blom tilted the cube of a conventional house 45 degrees, and rested it upon a hexagon-shaped pylon. His design represents a village within a city, where each house represents a tree, and all the houses together, a forest. The central idea of the cube houses around the world is mainly optimizing the space, as a house, to a better distribution of the rooms inside.

The Four Pests Campaign (), was one of the first actions taken in the Great Leap Forward in China from 1958 to 1962. The four pests to be eliminated were rats, flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows. The extermination of sparrows is also known as Smash Sparrows Campaign () or Eliminate Sparrows Campaign (), which resulted in severe ecological imbalance, being one of the causes of the Great Chinese Famine. In 1960, Mao Zedong ended the campaign against sparrows and redirected the fourth focus to bed bugs. Campaign The \\"Four Pests\\" campaign was introduced in 1958 by Mao Zedong, as a hygiene campaign aimed to eradicate the pests responsible for the transmission of pestilence and disease: the mosquitos responsible for malaria; the rodents that spread the plague; the pervasive airborne flies; and the sparrows‚Äîspecifically the Eurasian tree sparrow‚Äîwhich ate grain seed and fruit. The government also declared that \\"birds are public animals of capitalism\\". According to some eyewitnesses, citizens would bang pots and pans so that sparrows would not have the chance to rest on tree branches and would fall dead from the sky. Sparrow nests were also destroyed, eggs were broken, and chicks were killed. In addition to these tactics, citizens also resorted to simply shooting the birds down from the sky. These mass attacks depleted the sparrow population, pushing it to near extinction. Furthermore, contests were held among enterprises, government agencies, and schools in cleanliness. Non-material rewards were given to those who handed in the largest number of rat tails, dead flies and mosquitoes, or dead sparrows. > At dawn one day last week, the slaughter of the sparrows in Peking began, > continuing a campaign that has been going on in the countryside for months. > The objection to the sparrows is that, like the rest of China's inhabitants, > they are hungry.

The personnel of the Polish embassy in Beijing denied the Chinese request of entering the premises of the embassy to scare away the sparrows who were hiding there and as a result the embassy was surrounded by people with drums. After two days of constant drumming, the Poles had to use shovels to clear the embassy of dead sparrows. Effects By April 1960, Chinese leaders changed their opinion due to the influence of ornithologist Tso-hsin Cheng who pointed out that sparrows ate a large number of insects, as well as grains. Rather than being increased, rice yields after the campaign were substantially decreased. Mao ordered the end of the campaign against sparrows, replacing them with bed bugs, as the extermination of sparrows upset the ecological balance, and insects destroyed crops as a result of the absence of natural predators. By this time, however, it was too late. With no sparrows to eat them, locust populations ballooned, swarming the country and compounding the ecological problems already caused by the Great Leap Forward, including widespread deforestation and misuse of poisons and pesticides. Ecological imbalance is credited with exacerbating the Great Chinese Famine, in which 15‚Äì45 million people died of starvation. The Chinese government eventually resorted to importing 250,000 sparrows from the Soviet Union to replenish their population. Revived campaign On June 19, 1998, a poster was spotted at Southwest Agricultural University in Chongqing, \\"Get rid of the Four Pests\\". Ninety-five percent of households were ordered to get rid of four pests. This time, sparrows were replaced with cockroaches. A similar campaign was spotted in the spring of 1998 in Beijing. Few people responded to these campaigns, as many already had the habit of killing the aforementioned pests, especially cockroaches. Cultural influence In the 2009 TVB drama series Rosy Business (set in mid-19th-century China), a peasant came up with the idea of killing the sparrows to improve agricultural output. It was meant to be a prank used to trick the peasant owners into starvation and poverty. The Smash Sparrows Campaign is mentioned in the 1960 Michael Carreras movie Passport to China. In a brief scene people are shown using fireworks to make the sparrows ascend. In episode 20 of the 2001 children's animated television series Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat (set in China around 1900), the mistress of the house declares that certain useless animals are banned from the compound. After the animals‚Äîthe episode's eponymous birds, bees, and silkworms‚Äîare driven out, the family discovers the consequences. The mistress's fancy banquet is ruined by the lack of food and clothing, and she learns a valuable lesson. The album Every Red Heart Shines Toward the Red Sun (2006) by the American post-rock band Red Sparowes tells, by way of its song titles, the story of the Great Sparrow Campaign. The children's book Sparrow Girl (2009) by Sara Pennypacker tells the story of the Sparrow War.

It is currently the third largest brewery in Indiana with a total of six locations across Central Indiana. Upland currently makes over 80 beers per year which include ales, lagers, and sour beers. History Upland Brewing Company was founded in 1997 by Marc Sattinger, Russ Levitt and Dean LaPlante. The brewery takes its name from the Indiana Uplands, a geographic region of southern Indiana, with Bloomington being near their northern terminus. In 1998, distribution of bottles and kegs began and the brewpub opened its doors. The first beers on tap were the Wheat Ale, Pale Ale, and Bad Elmer's Porter. The brewpub began serving food the following year. Growing to be a Central Indiana staple, by 2004 its distribution had reached all 92 counties of Indiana. In 2006, ownership changed hands to a group of local investors remains 100% family owned. By 2010, distribution had expanded to include ales and lagers throughout Indiana and in parts of Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, and Wisconsin with small batch sour ales selling only through its tap room. In 2016, Upland began limited distribution nationally after adding a wood-aged sour beer production facility and is currently distributing in 20+ markets across the country. In 2009 a 2nd location known as the Indy Tasting Room opened in Indianapolis in the Meridian-Kessler/south Broad Ripple neighborhood. In 2012, a new brewing facility and bar was opened on the west side of Bloomington. This 37,000 square foot facility became the primary brewing facility for Upland, encompassing their everyday and seasonal lineup. The old brewery on 11th Street was scaled down to become a research and development site for Upland's growing Belgian-style sour and wild ale program. Also in 2012, Upland obtained the rights to Champagne Velvet, a pre- prohibition pilsener originally made by Terre Haute Brewing Co in 1902, and began brewing and distributing the classic brew under the Upland name. In 2013, Upland expanded further north with the addition of the Carmel Tap House, their second site to serve food. In the summer of 2016, Upland opened a new restaurant location in Columbus. It is fixed in the old Columbus Pump House building downtown, giving it the name \\"The Pump House\\". Later that same year, Upland opened The Wood Shop to serve as the home for their sour ale production, located next door to the Bloomington Brewpub. The Indy Tasting Room was renovated in 2018 and in 2019 saw a restaurant added on. The expanded space became known as 'Upland College Ave' due to its location at 49th & College Avenue. Upland's seventh location and fifth restaurant is set to open in mid-2019 in the Fountain Square neighborhood and will be known as 'Upland FSQ'. Sours Upland Brewing has been a sour producer for over 10 years. After trading a few cases of beer for a few wine barrels from Oliver Winery in 2006, they began their exploration into sour brewing. The Wood Shop, a brewery and taproom dedicated to sour ales, was opened in 2016. *Sour Wild Funk Fest is Upland‚Äôs annual festival which takes place in Indianapolis every spring. Featuring approximately 50 breweries from across the world. Since 2017 the festival has been held at the Mavris Arts & Event Center.

Sufferers primarily have a depressed mood for two weeks or more, and a loss of interest or pleasure in everyday activities, accompanied by other symptoms such as feelings of emptiness, hopelessness, anxiety, worthlessness, guilt and irritability, changes in appetite, problems concentrating, remembering details or making decisions, and thoughts of suicide. Insomnia or hypersomnia, aches, pains, or digestive problems that are resistant to treatment may also be present. The description has been formalized in psychiatric diagnostic criteria such as the DSM-5 and ICD-10.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth Edition Biological, psychological, and social factors are believed to be involved in the cause of depression, although it is still not well understood. Factors like socioeconomic status, life experience, and personality tendencies play a role in the development of depression and may represent increases in risk for developing a major depressive episode. There are many theories as to how depression occurs. One interpretation is that neurotransmitters in the brain are out of balance, and this results in feelings of worthlessness and despair. Magnetic resonance imaging shows that brains of people who have depression look different than the brains of people not exhibiting signs of depression. A family history of depression increases the chance of being diagnosed. Emotional pain and economic costs are associated with depression. In the United States and Canada, the costs associated with major depression are comparable to those related to heart disease, diabetes, and back problems and are greater than the costs of hypertension. According to the Nordic Journal of Psychiatry, there is a direct correlation between major depressive episode and unemployment. Treatments for a major depressive episode include psychotherapy and antidepressants, although in more serious cases, hospitalization or intensive outpatient treatment may be required. Signs and symptoms The criteria below are based on the formal DSM-V criteria for a major depressive episode. A diagnosis of major depressive episode requires that the patient has experienced five or more of the symptoms below, and one of the symptoms must be either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure (although both are frequently present). These symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks and represent a change from the patient's normal behavior. =Depressed mood and loss of interest (anhedonia)= Either depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure must be present for the diagnosis of a major depressive episode. Depressed mood is the most common symptom seen in major depressive episodes. Interest or pleasure in everyday activities can be decreased; this is referred to as anhedonia. These feelings must be present on an everyday basis for two weeks or longer to meet DSM-V criteria for a major depressive episode. In addition, the person may experience one or more of the following emotions: sadness, emptiness, hopelessness, indifference, anxiety, tearfulness, pessimism, emotional numbness, or irritability. In children and adolescents, a depressed mood often appears more irritable in nature. There may be a loss of interest in or desire for sex, or other activities once found to be pleasant. Friends and family of the depressed person may notice that they have withdrawn from friends, or neglected or quit doing activities that were once a source of enjoyment. =Sleep= Nearly every day, the person may sleep excessively, known as hypersomnia, or not enough, known as insomnia. Insomnia is the most common type of sleep disturbance for people who are clinically depressed. Symptoms of insomnia include trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, or waking up too early in the morning. Hypersomnia is a less common type of sleep disturbance. It may include sleeping for prolonged periods at night or increased sleeping during the daytime. The sleep may not be restful, and the person may feel sluggish despite many hours of sleep, which may amplify their depressive symptoms and interfere with other aspects of their lives. Hypersomnia is often associated with an atypical depression, as well as seasonal affective disorder. = Feelings of guilt or worthlessness = Depressed people may have feelings of guilt that go beyond a normal level or are delusional. These feelings of guilt and/or worthlessness are excessive and inappropriate. Major depressive episodes are notable for a significant, often unrealistic, drop in self-esteem. The guilt and worthlessness experienced in a major depressive episode can range from subtle feelings of guilt to frank delusions or to shame and humiliation. Additionally, self-loathing is common in clinical depression, and can lead to a downward spiral when combined with other symptoms. = Loss of energy = Persons going through a major depressive episode often have a general lack of energy, as well as fatigue and tiredness, nearly every day for at least 2 weeks. A person may feel tired without having engaged in any physical activity, and day-to-day tasks become increasingly difficult. Job tasks or housework become very tiring, and the patient finds that their work begins to suffer. =Decreased concentration= Nearly every day, the person may be indecisive or have trouble thinking or concentrating. These issues cause significant difficulty in functioning for those involved in intellectually demanding activities, such as school and work, especially in difficult fields. Depressed people often describe a slowing of thought, inability to concentrate and make decisions, and being easily distracted. In the elderly, the decreased concentration caused by a major depressive episode may present as deficits in memory. This is referred to as pseudodementia and often goes away with treatment. Decreased concentration may be reported by the patient or observed by others. =Change in eating, appetite, or weight= In a major depressive episode, appetite is most often decreased, although a small percentage of people experience an increase in appetite. A person experiencing a depressive episode may have a marked loss or gain of weight (5% of their body weight in one month). A decrease in appetite may result in weight loss that is unintentional or when a person is not dieting. Some people experience an increase in appetite and may gain significant amounts of weight. They may crave certain types of food, such as sweets or carbohydrates. In children, failure to make expected weight gains may be counted towards this criteria. Overeating is often associated with atypical depression. =Motor activity= Nearly every day, others may see that the person's activity level is not normal. People suffering from depression may be overly active (psychomotor agitation) or be very lethargic (psychomotor retardation). Psychomotor agitation is marked by an increase in body activity which may result in restlessness, an inability to sit still, pacing, hand wringing, or fidgeting with clothes or objects. Psychomotor retardation results in a decrease in body activity or thinking. In this case, a depressed person may demonstrate a slowing of thinking, speaking, or body movement. They may speak more softly or say less than usual. To meet diagnostic criteria, changes in motor activity must be so abnormal that it can be observed by others. Personal reports of feeling restless or feeling slow do not count towards the diagnostic criteria. = Thoughts of death and suicide = A person going through a major depressive episode may have repeated thoughts about death (other than the fear of dying) or suicide (with or without a plan), or may have made a suicide attempt. The frequency and intensity of thoughts about suicide can range from believing that friends and family would be better off if one were dead, to frequent thoughts about committing suicide (generally related to wishing to stop the emotional pain), to detailed plans about how the suicide would be carried out. Those who are more severely suicidal may have made specific plans and decided upon a day and location for the suicide attempt. =Comorbid disorders= Major depressive episodes may show comorbidity (association) with other physical and mental health problems. About 20‚Äì25% of individuals with a chronic general medical condition will develop major depression. Common comorbid disorders include: eating disorders, substance-related disorders, panic disorder, and obsessive- compulsive disorder. Up to 25% of people who experience a major depressive episode have a pre-existing dysthymic disorder. Some persons who have a fatal illness or are at the end of their life may experience depression, although this is not universal.  Causes  The cause of a major depressive episode is not well understood. However, the mechanism is believed to be a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. A major depressive episode can often follow an acute stress in someone's life. Evidence suggests that psychosocial stressors play a larger role in the first 1-2 depressive episodes, while having less influence in later episodes. People who experience a major depressive episode often have other mental health issues. Other risk factors for a depressive episode include: * Family history of a mood disorder * Recent negative life events * Personality (insecure, worried, stress- sensitive, obsessive, unassertive, dependent) * Early childhood trauma * Postpartum * Lack of interpersonal relationships One gene by itself has not been linked to depression. Studies show that depression can be passed down in families, but this is believed to be due to a combined effect of genetic and environmental factors. Other medical conditions, like hypothyroidism for example, may cause someone to experience similar symptoms as a major depressive episode, however this would be considered a mood disorder due to a general medical condition, according to the DSM-V. Diagnosis = Criteria = The two main symptoms in a major depressive episode are a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure. From the list below, one bold symptom and four other symptoms must be present for a diagnosis of major depressive episode. These symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks and must be causing significant distress or impairment in functioning. * Depressed mood * Loss of interest or pleasure * Change in appetite * Change in sleep * Change in body activity (psychomotor changes) * Loss of energy * Feelings of worthlessness and excessive or inappropriate guilt * Indecisiveness or a decrease in concentration * Suicidal ideation To diagnose a major depressive episode, a trained healthcare provider must make sure that: * The symptoms do not meet the criteria for a mixed episode. * The symptoms must cause considerable distress or impair functioning at work, in social settings or in other important areas in order to qualify as an episode. * The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., abuse of a drug or medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism). = Workup = No labs are diagnostic of a depressive episode. But some labs can help rule out general medical conditions that may mimic the symptoms of a depressive episode. Healthcare providers may order some routine blood work, including routine blood chemistry, CBC with differential, thyroid function studies, and Vitamin B12 levels, before making a diagnosis. = Differential Diagnosis = There are other mental health disorders or medical conditions to consider before diagnosing a major depressive episode: *Bipolar disorder *Cyclothymic disorder *Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder *Persistent depressive disorder * Anxiety disorder (Generalized anxiety, PTSD, obsessive compulsive disorder) * Substance abuse or Substance Use Disorder * Personality disorder with depressive symptoms * Adjustment disorder * Depression due to a general medical condition * Premenstrual dysphoric disorder  Screening  Healthcare providers may screen patients in the general population for depression using a screening tool, such as the Patient Healthcare Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). If the PHQ-2 screening is positive for depression, a provider may then administer the PHQ-9. The Geriatric Depression Scale is a screening tool that can be used in the elderly population. Treatment Depression is a treatable illness. Treatments for a major depressive episode may be provided by mental health specialists (i.e. psychologist, psychiatrists, social workers, counselors, etc.), mental health centers or organizations, hospitals, outpatient clinics, social service agencies, private clinics, peer support groups, clergy, and employee assistance programs. The treatment plan could include psychotherapy alone, antidepressant medications alone, or a combination of medication and psychotherapy. For major depressive episodes of severe intensity (multiple symptoms, minimal mood reactivity, severe functional impairment), combined psychotherapy and antidepressant medications are more effective than psychotherapy alone. Meta-analyses suggest that the combination of psychotherapy and antidepressant medications is more effective in treating mild and moderate forms of depression as well, compared to either type of treatment alone. Patients with severe symptoms may require outpatient treatment or hospitalization. The treatment of a major depressive episode can be split into 3 phases: # Acute phase: the goal of this phase is to resolve the current major depressive episode # Continuation: this phase continues the same treatment from the acute phase for 4‚Äì8 months after the depressive episode has resolved and the goal is to prevent relapse # Maintenance: this phase is not necessary for every patient but is often used for patients who have experienced 2‚Äì3 or more major depressive episodes. Treatment may be maintained indefinitely to prevent the occurrence and severity of future episodes. = Therapy = Psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy, counseling, or psychosocial therapy, is characterized by a patient talking about their condition and mental health issues with a trained therapist. Different types of psychotherapy are used as a treatment for depression. These include cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness techniques. Evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be as effective as medication in the treatment of a major depressive episode. Psychotherapy may be the first treatment used for mild to moderate depression, especially when psychosocial stressors are playing a large role. Psychotherapy alone may not be as effective for more severe forms of depression. Some of the main forms of psychotherapies used for treatment of a major depressive episode along with what makes them unique are included below: * Cognitive psychotherapy: focus on patterns of thinking * Interpersonal psychotherapy: focus on relationships, losses, and conflict resolution * Problem-solving psychotherapy: focus on situations and strategies for problem-solving * Psychodynamic psychotherapy: focus on defense mechanisms and coping strategies = Medication = Prozac is one example of an SSRI, the class of antidepressant medications that is used as the first line in treatment of depression. Medications used to treat depression include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and atypical antidepressants such as mirtazapine, which do not fit neatly into any of the other categories. Different antidepressants work better for different individuals. It is often necessary to try several before finding one that works best for a specific patient. Some people may find it necessary to combine medications, which could mean two antidepressants or an antipsychotic medication in addition to an antidepressant. If a person's close relative has responded well to a certain medication, that treatment will likely work well for him or her. Antidepressant medications are effective in the acute, continuation, and maintenance phases of treatment, as described above. The treatment benefits of antidepressant medications are often not seen until 1‚Äì2 weeks into treatment, with maximum benefits being reached around 4‚Äì6 weeks. Most healthcare providers will monitor patients more closely during the acute phase of treatment and continue to monitor at longer intervals in the continuation and maintenance phases. Sometimes, people stop taking antidepressant medications due to side effects, although side effects often become less severe over time. Suddenly stopping treatment or missing several doses may cause withdrawal-like symptoms. Some studies have shown that antidepressants may increase short-term suicidal thoughts or actions, especially in children, adolescents, and young adults. However, antidepressants are more likely to reduce a person's risk of suicide in the long run. Below are listed the main classes of antidepressant medications, some of the most common drugs in each category, and their major side effects: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline): major side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and sexual dysfunction * Serotinin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine): major side effects include nausea, diarrhea, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and tremor * Tricyclic antidepressants (amitryptiline, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, nortriptyline): major side effects include sedation, low blood pressure when moving from sitting to standing (orthostatic hypotension), tremor, and heart issues like conduction delays or arrythmias * Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (isocarboxazid, phenelzine, selegiline): major side effects include high blood pressure (emergency) if eaten with foods rich in tyramine (e.g. cheeses, some meats, and home-brewed beer), sedation, tremor, and orthostatic hypotension = Alternative treatments = There are several treatment options that exist for people who have experienced several episodes of major depression or have not responded to several treatments. Electroconvulsive therapy is a treatment in which a generalized seizure is induced by means of electrical current. The mechanism of action of the treatment is not clearly understood but has been show to be most effective in the most severely depressed patients. For this reason, electroconvulsive therapy is preferred for the most severe forms of depression or depression that has not responded to other treatments, known as refractory depression. Vagus nerve stimulation is another alternative treatment that has been proven to be effective in the treatment of depression, especially people that have been resistant to four or more treatments. Some of the unique benefits of vagus nerve stimulation include improved neurocognitive function and a sustained clinical response. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is also an alternative treatment for a major depressive episode. It is a noninvasive treatment that is easily tolerated and shows an antidepressant effect, especially in more typical depression and younger adults. Prognosis If left untreated, a typical major depressive episode may last for about six months. About 20% of these episodes can last two years or more. About half of depressive episodes end spontaneously. However, even after the major depressive episode is over, 20% to 30% of patients have residual symptoms, which can be distressing and associated with disability. Fifty percent of people will have another major depressive episode after the first. However, the risk of relapse is decreased by taking antidepressant medications for more than 6 months. Symptoms completely improve in six to eight weeks in sixty to seventy percent of patients. The combination of therapy and antidepressant medications has been shown to improve resolution of symptoms and outcomes of treatment. Suicide is the 8th leading cause of death in the United States. The risk of suicide is increased during a major depressive episode. However, the risk is even more elevated during the first two phases of treatment. There are several factors associated with an increased risk of suicide, listed below: * Greater than 45 years of age * Male * History of suicide attempt or self- injurious behaviors * Family history of suicide or mental illness * Recent severe loss * Poor health * Detailed plan * Inability to accept help * Lack of social support * Psychotic features (auditory or visual hallucinations, disorganization of speech, behavior, or thought) * Alcohol or drug use or comorbid psychiatric disorder * Severe depression Epidemiology Estimates of the numbers of people suffering from major depressive episodes and major depressive disorder (MDD) vary significantly. Overall, 13-20% of people will experience significant depressive symptoms at some point in their life. The overall prevalence of MDD is slightly lower ranging from 3.7-6.7% of people. In their lifetime, 20% to 25% of women, and 7% to 12% of men will suffer a major depressive episode. The peak period of development is between the ages of 25 and 44 years. Onset of major depressive episodes or MDD often occurs to people in their mid-20s, and less often to those over 65. The prevalence of depressive symptoms in the elderly is around 1-2%. Elderly persons in nursing homes may have increased rates, up to 15-25%. African-Americans have higher rates of depressive symptoms compared to other races. Prepubescent girls are affected at a slightly higher rate than prepubescent boys. In a National Institute of Mental Health study, researchers found that more than 40% of people with post-traumatic stress disorder suffered from depression four months after the traumatic event they experienced. Women who have recently given birth may be at increased risk for having a major depressive episode. This is referred to as postpartum depression and is a different health condition than the baby blues, a low mood that resolves within 10 days after delivery.

In 1913 the family moved to Nova Scotia, where his father had taken a training position with the Canadian Militia. The elder Raddall then saw active service during the First World War and was killed in action at Amiens in August 1918. Raddall attended Chebucto School in Halifax until 6 December 1917, when the school was converted into a temporary morgue in the wake of the Halifax Explosion. The Raddall family survived the explosion and Raddall wrote about it in his memoirs, In My Time. Raddall's first job was as a wireless operator on seagoing ships, including the CS Mackay-Bennett, and at isolated wireless posts such as Sable Island. He later took a job as a clerk at a pulp and paper mill in Liverpool, Nova Scotia, where he began his writing career. There, Raddall came in contact with the master American swindler and fugitive from justice, Leo Koretz, who was using the alias, Lou Keyte.: The Incredible Story of a Master Swindler who Seduced a City and Captivated the Nation. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill and HarperCollins Canada: New York and Toronto, 2015. ()  Career as a writer  Raddall was a prolific, award-winning writer. He received Governor General's Awards for three of his books, The Pied Piper of Dipper Creek (1943), Halifax, Warden of the North (1948) and The Path of Destiny (1957). He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1971. Raddall is best known for his historical fiction, but he also published numerous non-fictional historical works. His interest in historical research grew when he was stationed at historical locations as a wireless operator, and he received crucial encouragement and assistance from Harry Piers, Curator of the Nova Scotia Museum, who became his mentor.Thomas Raddall, In My Time McClellend and Steward (1976 ), p. 116 Raddall's early works included studies of privateering, civic and marine history, and Canada during the War of 1812. His history of Halifax, Warden of the North, remains influential.  Historical preservation and restoration  Raddall worked with the Queens County Historical Society, the Historic Sites Advisory Council of Nova Scotia, and the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. He played a role in preserving the diary of Simeon Perkins, an early colonial document published in three volumes (the fourth has yet to be published) between 1948 and 1978 by the Champlain Society, and edited by Harold Innis, D. C. Harvey and C. B. Ferguson. Raddall helped to restore and preserve Perkins House Museum, a colonial house built by Simeon Perkins that is now a part of the Nova Scotia Museum system.  Legacy  An exact replica of Raddall's study, furnished with his possessions, is on view at the Thomas Raddall Research Centre, administered by the Queens County Historical Society, of which Raddall was a founding member in 1929. His correspondence is housed at the Dalhousie University Archives, which also runs the Thomas Raddall Electronic Archive Project, currently digitizing his published and unpublished writings.Thomas Head Raddall Digital Collection The Thomas Head Raddall Award is a literary award administered for the best work of adult fiction published in the previous year by a writer from Canada's Atlantic provinces.

The former Gladrags model was known for her portrayal of bold and strong women-centric characters. She is best known for her work in TV series C.A.T.S., Special Squad and Kohinoor.  Early life and career  Randhawa was born on 29th January 1976 in Raniganj, Asansol, West Bengal. Her father served in the Indian police, which enabled Kuljeet to travel across India including Patiala, Punjab where her father was serving at the time of her suicide. She began modelling as a student, and her work included several ads and runway shows for major designers. She earned her Honours in Psychology from Delhi University. Randhawa began her career starring in Hip Hip Hurray replacing Shweta Salve as 'Prishita'. Her performance was appreciated but she came into the spotlight when she was signed as the new lead in UTV show C.A.T.S. where she again replaced an actress Karminder Kaur. The TV starring Nafisa Joseph and Malini Sharma became popular but remained slow on the ratings front. Randhawa was highly appreciated for her part as detective 'Ash'. Following the end of the series, Kuljeet continued to appear in many TV shows as cameos and side by side also featured in modelling assignments. Randhawa saw a huge success as a model but was completely choosy when it comes to acting. After C.A.T.S. she was not seen in a lead role and after a long gap she returned in a lead role in Star One's Special Squad Star One. Randhawa was not happy with the content being portrayed on Indian Television where actresses were mostly crying. She always opted for bold and strong women centric roles which is why she used to get typecasted in thriller roles. Randhawa played a cop/detective in more than five TV shows which was a record for any Indian Television actress and a unique one which no actress could follow successfully. Her performance was very well received in Special Squad but in order to increase the ratings, Gauri Pradhan Tejwani was signed as another female lead in the show. After six episodes, Kuljeet quit the show citing professional decisions however it was indicated that Kuljeet left the show because of Gauri which the previous declined later. Right after she quit Special Squad, Randhawa was signed to play 'Irawati Kohli' in Cinevistaas and Sahara One Production 'Kohinoor'. In an exclusive chat transcript, Randhawa revealed details about the show, Special Squad, Nafisa Joseph and more about herself. The season one of Kohinoor was well received by the audience and the makers were planning another season but it couldn't materialize after Randhawa committed suicide in 2006. Randhawa also appeared in several television series including Hip Hip Hurray, C.A.T.S., and a lead role in STAR One's Special Squad. She was supposed to appear in a film called 'By Chance' but the film was stalled and never released  Filmography  *Hip Hip Hurray ‚Äî Zee TV (Role ‚Äî Prishita) *C.A.T.S. - Sony TV (Lead Role ‚Äî Ash) *Rishtey ‚Äî Zee TV *Aahat ‚Äî Sony TV (Episodic) *Sarhadein ‚Äî Zee TV (Cameo) *Kyun Hota Hai Pyaar ‚Äî Star Plus (Cameo) *Kehta Hai Dil ‚Äî Star Plus (Cameo) *Kumkum ‚Äì Ek Pyara Sa Bandhan‚ÄîStar Plus (Supporting Role) *Kambhkht Ishq ‚Äî Zee TV (Cameo) *Special Squad ‚Äî Star One (Lead Role ‚Äî Shaina Singh) *Kohinoor ‚Äî Sahara One (Lead Role ‚Äî Irawati Kohli) Besides Acting, Randhawa worked on a number of modelling assignments for brands like Reid and Taylor, Recova, Maggi, Anchor Switches etc.  Death  On 8 February 2006, Kuljeet hanged herself in her apartment in Juhu, a town in western Maharashtra. In a suicide note, Kuljeet stated that she was ending her life as she was unable to cope with life's pressures. Shortly before her death, she had completed filming for the movie By Chance. She died at the age of 30.

It was released as the album's fifth and final single in 1993. A music video was made, but merely consists of live footage of the band from a 1992 show at the Winter Show Buildings in Wellington, New Zealand overdubbed with the original album track. The video is notable because it is one of only two videos to feature guitarist Arik Marshall (\\"Breaking the Girl\\" being the other). The video was rarely aired on music television and the song along with the video was not featured on the band's Greatest Hits album. Like the song \\"Aeroplane\\" from their 1995 album One Hot Minute, it was one of the two music videos from the Warner era not available on their official app. The verses of the song consist of a scratchy, minimalist funk lick played on the guitar, with a busier bass melody playing behind it. The lyrics in the verses are a stream of consciousness style run of non-sequiturs, which the chorus then explains by stating \\"If you have to ask, you'll never know\\". While guitarist John Frusciante finishes the solo at the end of the song, the production crew and the band can be heard applauding him. However, no attempts were made to edit out the applause or to re-record it like with all other unintended sounds found on the album.

Recent research into police files has revealed that the bombings were instigated by Auguste Coulon, an agent provocateur of Special Branch Inspector William Melville, who would go on to become an early official of what became MI5.  Initial arrests  On 6 January 1892, Joe Deakin, an anarchist from Walsall, was arrested on Tottenham Court Road, London on his way to the Autonomie Club. He was remanded in custody at Great Marlborough Street Magistrates Court the next day on a charge of manufacturing bombs. Following this court appearance, Inspector Melville went to Walsall and that evening arrested Victor Cails, a Frenchman, and Fred Charles at the Socialist Club in Goodall Street, Walsall. Later William Ditchfield and John Westley were arrested in Walsall and Jean Battola, an Italian, was arrested in London. Deakin and Battola were taken to Walsall to stand trial. They were all jointly charged with bomb making. At their first appearance at the Walsall police court, the prosecution asked for a week's remand on the grounds that \\"[t]he authorities both in Walsall and London had received very important information with reference to what he might call a widespread conspiracy throughout the country.\\"  Evidence  The evidence presented was as follows: :In Charles' possession was plans for a bomb with instructions in French, a model of a bolt allegedly to fit the top of the bomb and a French manifesto written by Cails called The Means of Emancipation which included: '\\"Let us occupy ourselves with chemistry, and let us manufacture promptly bombs, dynamite and other explosive matters much more efficacious than guns and barricades to bring about the destruction of the actual state of things, and above all, to spare the precious blood of our comrades. Courage, companions! Long Live Anarchy! Walsall, 1 September 1891.\\"' :In Cails' possession was found a fuse and several French Anarchist publications, including issue number 7 of L'International, which gave instructions on making bombs and how to use them for the demolition of public buildings. :At Ditchfield's workshop 'a plaster cast of a bomb similar to the sketch produced' was found and at his home a bolt 'for the head of one of the missiles'. In the basement of the Socialist Club there was 'a quantity of clay mixed with hair, evidently for moulding purposes'. All six were remanded in custody, although no explosives were actually found and there was no evidence as regards the other three defendants.  Subsequent arrests and confessions  spy in the pay of the Russian and British police. Under the false belief that Charles was a police spy, Deakin made a confession. However, his confession also implicated Auguste Coulon, a French anarchist, who worked as an assistant in the school set up by Louise Michel for the education of the children of the foreign socialists in London. He was also involved in trying to organise chemistry classes and translating and circulating information about bomb making. The police also arrested a Swiss inventor called Cavargna, who had invented some small explosive shells for exterminating rabbits in Australia. He was released after two days. A further person named McCormack, who had been recently expelled from the socialist club in Walsall, offered his services to the police, who soon decided he was unreliable. He went to Birmingham where he sold his story to the newspaper and got drunk on the proceeds. Arrested for being drunk and disorderly, he promptly declared in court next day that he had been employed by the police to fabricate evidence against the Walsall Anarchists. Charles Mowbray and David Nicholl were soon also arrested on conspiracy charges. Following his release, Nicholl was raising money for the Walsall anarchists when, by chance, Coulon's brother let slip that Coulon himself was a police agent. The defence brought up the situation at the police court and gave Coulon's address asking why he had not been arrested as well. After Nicholl had set up an anarchist defence fund, Edward Carpenter set up one which raised money in socialist circles. Their different political outlook was especially noticeable as regards to what extent they felt the whole trial was a case of police provocation.  Atmosphere of the trial and conviction  The case aroused media attention, particularly around two texts: the Means of Emancipation and The Anarchist Feast at The Operathe latter was a detailed account of how to cause the maximum amount of carnage in an opera house by rupturing the gas supply and leaving incendiary devices in the seats, while the miscreant could make their escape. Following three bombings in Paris, the correspondent for The Times made the connection: 'Anarchists should not be regarded as members of a political party, and it should not be possible for an Anarchist to hurry away from Paris to find an asylum in Brussels, in Geneva or in London.' Ravachol was arrested for two of these bombings, and promptly made a confession. The climate of the trial was not conducive to a sober consideration of the factsThe Anarchist Feast at The Opera was read out as if it were the views of the defendants. The defense did not argue that it was a police plot. Charles, Cails and Battola were found guilty; Deakin guilty but with a recommendation for mercy; and Westley and Ditchfield not guilty. Those found guilty were allowed to make a statement, whereupon the first three stated they thought it was a police plot. Charles, Battola and Cails were given ten years each, and Deakin five. Although the judge denied he was punishing them for being anarchists, The Times was more to the point: :The offence with which the prisoners were charged is one of the most dastardly and wicked which it is possible to conceive. Like treason it is aimed at the very heart of the State, but it is not designed to destroy the existing Government alone. It strikes at all Governments, and behind all Governments it strikes at those elementary social rights for the defence of which all forms and methods of civil rules exist. The crime of which the Walsall prisoners have been found guilty was no isolated act ( ... ) Hate, envy, the lust of plunder, and the lust of bloodshed are stamped on every line of the Anarchist literature read at Walsall and on every word of the confessions made by RAVACHOL. 'Alas! Alas! Ten years for Charles, it is too bad. An evil conscience makes them cowards.' wrote Edward Carpenter following the trial.

It is concerned with all modes of public transport, such as passenger train service, aviation including air safety, and urban transit. The association functions as a citizen-based advocacy group, compared to transport industry based bodies such as the Railway Association of Canada or the Canadian Urban Transit Association. Activities The association regularly communicates with government and industry officials to promote sustainable transport views, including Transport Canada and elected officials of all government levels. Canadian news media agencies frequently interview Transport 2000 Canada officials on transportation matters. History The organization was founded as Transport 2000 Canada in 1976 following concerns about the future of passenger trains in Canada. Passenger train service in Canada had declined in the latter 20th century as train routes were being eliminated by Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1993, Transport 2000 became one of seven Canadian non-for-profit organisations supported by The Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Family Foundation's Urban Issues program. The association continued to monitor and address developments in the national passenger transportation system, especially since the 1978 formation of Via Rail Canada to provide national passenger train service. The association later formed its Air Passenger Safety Group, especially prompted by the September 1998 Swissair Flight 111 disaster off the Nova Scotia coastline. Urban transit is an increasingly important topic addressed by the national and regional associations of the organization. The organization's support for the O-Train pilot project (today's Trillium Line) was a significant factor in returning rail transit service to Ottawa in 2001. Transport Action Canada has since been critical of the subsequent plans to develop the North-South Light Rail Transit line, citing the proposals to combine the downtown train with bus congestion, disruption to existing O-Train travel (today's Trillium Line) during the line's construction, and longer-term viability of the proposed North-South route. National office facilities for Transport Action Canada are located in Ottawa, Ontario. The association has been a contributor to the development of aviation regulation, particularly as it relates to airline passengers, though Transport Canada's Canadian Aviation Regulation Advisory Council (CARAC) process. Organization Transport Action Canada is composed as a federation of the following like-minded regional associations: = Transport Action Atlantic = (Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island)Transport Action Atlantic = Transport Action British Columbia = (British Columbia)Transport Action British Columbia = Transport Action Ontario = (Ontario)Transport Action Ontario = Transport Action Prairies = (Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan) Transport Action Prairie = Transport Action Quebec = (Quebec) Equiterre Publications The organization publishes a newsletter titled Transport Action which provides news and opinion on topical transportation matters. This is published six times per year and primarily distributed to its members. Members of Transport Action Canada are often members of one or more of the affiliated regional associations which often publish their own newsletters. A bulletin of transport-related news is also produced on an approximately weekly basis. This \\"hotline\\" is published on the association's official website.

Red indicates the boundaries of the region The Red Hills or Tallahassee Hills is a region of gently rolling hills in the southeastern United States. It is a geomorphic region and an ecoregion. Location The Red Hills or Tallahassee Hills region covers parts of Gadsden, Leon, and Jefferson counties in Florida, and Grady and Thomas counties in Georgia. It is bounded on the west by the Ochlockonee River, on the south by the Cody Scarp, on the east by the watershed of the Aucilla River, and on the north by the Tifton Upland of Georgia. The Cody Scarp drops about from the Red Hills or Tallahassee Hills to the Gulf Coastal Lowlands to the south. History The area was first settled by paleo-indians in and around the various lakes in the southern part of the Red Hills. Apalachee indians were found here in the 16th century. The Apalachee were almost annihilated through wars, disease, and slavery. In the 18th century, the Seminoles made the Red Hills their home until the early 19th century and the Seminole Wars. Also in the 19th century, white settlers began cotton plantations, which thrived until the Civil War. At one time, Leon County, Florida, was the 5th largest producer of cotton among all counties in Georgia and Florida. After the Civil War, many of the Red Hills' plantations became winter homes and quail hunting plantations for wealthy northerners; the area between Thomasville and Tallahassee is still home to dozens of such plantations, such as Greenwood, Pebble Hill, and Goodwood. Geography Rolling hills, ravines and gullies covered by forests and the large lakes of Lake Jackson, Lake Iamonia, Lake Miccosukee, Lake Lafayette, and Lake Talquin. The highest point in the Red Hills is 280 feet (85.3m) north of Tallahassee by 10 miles. The soil is red clay deposited during the last ice age from the Appalachian Mountains. Rivers running through the Red Hills Region are the Aucilla River, Ochlockonee River, and Telogia Creek. The St. Marks River is subterranean until it meets the surface in the Woodville Karst Plain. Flora and fauna =Trees= The area is covered in a number of native species. There are a variety of oak including Southern live oak, water oak, laurel oak, white oak, overcup oak, post oak, black oak as well as other hardwood trees such as American sweetgum, a variety of magnolia, as well as hickory, flowering dogwood, red maple, and redbud. Conifers are also abundant, including shortleaf pine, loblolly pine. The Red Hills are home to some of the last remnants of the great longleaf pine forests remaining in the nation. =Animal life= The Red Hills Region supports northern bobwhite quail, white-tailed deer, red fox, raccoon, eastern grey squirrel, nine-banded armadillo, black bear, migratory birds, the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker, the gopher tortoise, the eastern diamondback rattlesnake, the eastern tiger salamander, and many other animals and plants.Oxford Journals: Stand structures on quail plantations =Features= The Red Hills Region serves as one of the highest recharge areas for the Floridan Aquifer -- which is critical to the drinking water supply for residents of Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. The Red Hills Region also has the largest concentration of undeveloped plantation lands in the United States. The Red Hills has been identified for special conservation efforts and the Nature Conservancy has designated the Red Hills as one of America's \\"Last Great Places.\\" Namesake event Each Spring, the equestrian community meets for the Red Hills Horse Trials, an Olympics qualifying event held at Elinor Klapp-Phipps Park.

It is the third largest cemetery in the United States, after the Calverton National Cemetery and Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery and is recognized as a US National Historic Landmark. History The cemetery dates from 1844, when members of the Cincinnati Horticultural Society formed a cemetery association. They took their inspiration from contemporary rural cemeteries such as P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, and Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The numerous springs and groves suggested the name \\"Spring Grove\\". On December 1, 1844 Salmon P. Chase and others prepared the Articles of Incorporation. The cemetery was designed by Howard Daniels and formally chartered on January 21, 1845. The first burial took place on September 1, 1845. In 1855, Adolph Strauch, a renowned landscape architect, was hired to beautify the grounds. His sense and layout of the \\"garden cemetery\\" made of lakes, trees and shrubs, is what visitors today still see. He created a more open landscape by setting limits on private enclosures and monument heights. The results of the redesign earned Strauch praise in the U.S. and abroad, including from Frederick Law Olmsted and the French landscape architect Edouard Andr√©. On March 29, 2007, the cemetery was designated a National Historic Landmark. The Spring Grove Cemetery Chapel is listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places. On October 23, 2013, cemetery staff removed a large and potentially disturbing SpongeBob SquarePants headstone from the grave of U.S. Army Corporal Kimberly Walker and another for her still-living sister a day after her funeral. The family believed they had permission from a worker, whom management said had erred. In February 2014, both parties agreed to replace the statues with granite slabs largely hiding them from passersby. Description Spring Grove encompasses of which are currently landscaped and maintained. Its grounds include 12 ponds, many fine tombstones and memorials, and various examples of Gothic Revival architecture. As of 2005, its National Champion trees were Cladrastis kentukea and Halesia diptera; its State Champion trees included Abies cilicica, Abies koreana, Cedrus libani, Chionanthus virginicus, Eucommia ulmoides, Halesia parvifolia, Metasequoia glyptostroboides, Phellodendron amurense, Picea orientalis, Picea polita, Pinus flexilis, Pinus griffithi, Pinus monticola, Quercus cerris, Quercus nigra, Taxodium distichum, Ulmus serotina, and Zelkova serrata.

Onslow was a descendant of George Onslow, eldest son of Lieutenant-General Richard Onslow, nephew of the first Baron and uncle of the first Earl. Early life and career He was educated at Harrow School and then Sandhurst. He then joined the military in 1944 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Queen's Own Hussars. Upon completing this service he read History at Oriel College, Oxford, Onslow then joined MI6 as a intelligence officer and had a tour of duty in Burma.https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/19/guardianobituaries.obituaries Political career Onslow resigned from the civil service in 1960 and became active in politics, first being elected to Dartford Rural Council and later to Kent County Council. In 1963 he was selected to succeed Harold Watkinson as MP for Woking and he was elected the following year in the 1964 general election. Once elected, Onslow demonstrated his right wing credentials by calling for lower taxes on the middle class and a reduction in third world aid. He also pursued a strong non-partisan interest in aviation, eventually chairing the Conservative aviation committee. =Government= He would later serve as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Aerospace from 1972 to 1974 in Edward Heath's government. In Margaret Thatcher's government he was made a Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1983, but resigned a year later. =1922 Committee= In 1984, he was elected to chair the 1922 Committee, and was therefore considered to be the most powerful backbencher in the Conservative party. In this post, he conveyed to Mrs Thatcher the desire of backbenchers that Leon Brittan should resign over the Westland affair and in the 1990 leadership contest that many backbenchers wanted a broader choice of candidates, contributing to her decision to drop out. This angered many allies of Thatcher, and in 1992 he was forced from his post as chairman of the 1922 Committee. Honours and styles =Honours= Having been sworn of the Privy Council in the 1988 New Year Honours, Onslow was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Knight Commander (KCMG) for \\"political service\\" in the 1993 New Year Honours and upon stepping down from Parliament in 1997 his life peerage was announced in the Resignation Honours and he was raised to the peerage as Baron Onslow of Woking, of Woking in the County of Surrey. Marriage In 1955, he married Lady June Hay, daughter of George Harley Hay-Drummond, 14th Earl of Kinnoull.

The first comix Rip Off Press published, in 1969, included R. Crumb's Big Ass Comics (June '69), a reprint of Jaxon's God Nose (originally published in 1964), Jaxon's Happy Endings Comics (August '69), and the first issue of Fred Schrier and Dave Sheridan's Mother's Oats Comix (October '69). After a fire almost destroyed the former opera house in late 1969, Rip Off moved to the decaying former headquarters of the Family Dog psychedelic rock music promotion collective (which Jaxon had been a member of starting in 1966). Rip Off Press was located at 1250 17th Street in San Francisco from 1970 until 1985. Other early works they published included comix by Frank Stack, Sheridan (all co-published with Gary Arlington's San Francisco Comic Book Company), The Rip Off Review of Western Culture omnibus, and Shelton's The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. By 1972 the poster printing business had faded away and the company had become a publishing house. = Changing times = As the underground comix market petered out in the mid-to- late 1970s, Rip Off Press shifted focus to other cartoonists and other comics (including in their long-running anthology Rip Off Comix). (By this point co- founders Moriaty and Jackson had long since gone back to Texas.) Larry Gonick published his Cartoon History of the Universe with Rip Off Press from 1978‚Äì1992.

In mid-1985, the company moved from its long-time home on 17th Street to a smaller space on San Jose Avenue near the city's southern border, with warehouse space across town at the Bayview Industrial Park. This three- story, block-square building, which housed over a hundred other businesses, burned to the ground on April 6, 1986, following an explosion in an illegal fireworks factory in the basement.\\"Rip Off Press Burns to the Ground,\\" The Comics Journal #108 (May 1986), p. 17. = Relocation to Auburn = Thus freed of a 17-year accumulation of comix and other paraphernalia, Fred Todd (who at this point was the only original partner still working in the business) decided to relocate Rip Off Press to Auburn, California, where he and his wife Kathe could continue to run the company while raising their two small children in more pleasant surroundings. The move was made in June 1987. Although Rip Off Press continued to publish Shelton's The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers plus the Rip Off Comix anthology, the popularity of erotic comics in the late 1980s/early 1990s led to such titles as Strips by Chuck Austen, The Girl by Kevin J.

The company has its earliest roots in American home services website Angie's List, founded in 1995 as an online directory that allows users to read and publish crowd-sourced reviews of local businesses and contractors. For the quarter ending on June 30, 2018, ANGI reported total revenue of US$1,132,000,000 and a net income of US$77,507,000., Yahoo Finance, August 23, 2016 On May 1, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that IAC planned to buy Angie's List. By September 2017 the new publicly traded company was called ANGI Homeservices Inc. Shares started trading in early October, 2017. In March 2019, ANGI moved its corporate headquarters to Denver, Colorado. History William S. Oesterle and Angie Hicks founded Angie's List in 1995. The idea resulted from Hicks's search for a reliable construction contractor in suburban Columbus, Ohio, on behalf of Oesterle, a venture capitalist who was Hicks's boss. Hicks moved to Columbus to join Oesterle in creating Columbus Neighbors, a call-in service, and publication with reviews of local home and lawn care services. The name and concept were based on Unified Neighbors in Indianapolis, Indiana. Hicks went door-to-door, signing up consumers as members and collecting ratings of local contractors. After Hicks recruited over 1,000 members in Columbus within one year, she turned to Oesterle to raise money from investors to develop the business. In 2013, Angie's List investors worried that the company had been in business for more than 18 years, yet never had shown an annual profit and that valuations of the company were unrealistic based on the actual revenue the company produces. But by 2015 growth estimates indicate a significant earnings-per-share growth, with a long-term growth rate at 19%. Combine this with stock estimates rising in 2015 by 13.3%, some Securities research firms such as Zacks Investment Research indicated ANGI is well-positioned for future earnings growth. = HomeAdvisor = In 1996, the company bought Unified Neighbors from its creator and moved the company's headquarters to Indianapolis. In 1998, ServiceMagic was founded by Rodney Rice and Michael Beaudoin who were part of the founding management team of Einstein Bros Bagels. In 2004, IAC acquired the website for an undisclosed price. On July 22, 2004, IAC acquired ServiceMagic. In October 2008, ServiceMagic acquired the French business 123Devis.com and Travaux.com, as well as UK business 123GetAQuote.co.uk to create ServiceMagic Europe. In March 2009, the UK business was rebranded as ServiceMagic.co.uk. In 2012, ServiceMagic changed its name to HomeAdvisor. In 2013, HomeAdvisor acquired Werkspot.nl, the leading Dutch home improvement platform. In 2014, Werkspot.nl opens her twin company in Italy: Instapro. By 2015, HomeAdvisor had achieved more than $300 million in annual revenue, been used by more than 30 million homeowners, had nearly 100,000 pre-screened service professionals in its network and almost 3 million verified reviews. In 2016, HomeAdvisor acquired the German home services company, MyHammer. In 2017, HomeAdvisor acquired Canada‚Äôs leading home services platform, HomeStars, and MyBuilder, the UK's leading home services platform connecting homeowners and tradesmen. = Angie's List = In 2010, Angie's List raised a total of $25 million in capital from investors. In September 2010, Wasatch Funds and Battery Ventures invested $22 million. In November 2010, Saints Capital led an additional funding of $2.5 million. On November 17, 2011, Angie's List began trading on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol ANGI. It priced 8.8M shares at $13 and opened for trading at $18, a 33% premium. In July 2016, Angie's List was made a freemium service; the basic membership tier, which includes access to more than 10 million reviews, was made free, alongside subscription tiers offering additional functionality. On October 2, 2017, IAC announced that it had agreed to acquire Angie's List for $781.4 million. and it merged Angie's List and HomeAdvisor, renaming the merged company to ANGI Homeservices, retaining Angie's List ticker symbol and stock history.

Overview The Theological College of the Holy Trinity was founded in 1942 (1935 Ethiopian Calendar) by Emperor Haile Selassie, originally serving as a high school. The college division was added on 5 October 1960, and the elementary education section was eliminated on 18 December 1961. The institution thereafter became one of the chartered units of the Haile Selassie I University this first National University of Ethiopia. With the end of the Imperial period in Ethiopia and the secular emphasis of the ruling Derg, the College was closed in 1978. The students subsequently transferred to Addis Ababa University to complete their education, and the College building was given to the university's Science department for its own use. In 1995, in response to a petition by TCHT alumnus Abuna Paulos and other senior members of the Ethiopian Church, the Transitional Government of Ethiopia returned ownership of the buildings to the Church. The Theological College of the Holy Trinity was also reopened, with 12 academic staff-members and 150 students.

It was developed by Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Jack Weaver during freestyle pistol competition in Southern California during the late 1950s.  Description  The Weaver stance has two main components. # The first component is a two- handed technique in which the shooting hand holds the pistol or revolver while the support hand wraps around the shooting hand. The shooting arm's elbow is slightly bent (almost locked out) while the support elbow is noticeably bent straight down. The shooter pushes forward with his/her shooting hand while the support hand exerts rearward pressure on the firearm. The resultant isometric tension from the support hand is intended to lessen and control muzzle flip when the firearm is fired; allowing for faster follow-up shots. # The second component is the positioning of the feet in a boxing stance, with the non- shooting side foot ahead of the shooting side foot. A person shooting right- handed will have the right foot angled out to approximately forty-five degrees to the side and to the rear at shoulder length. Most of the shooter's weight will be on the forward foot, with the forward knee slightly bent and the rear leg nearly straight. The shooter's upper torso should be leaning forward at the hips, aiming the shoulders towards the forward foot. The rear foot will help catch the force of recoil, as well as allow for rapid changes in position. Both of the shooter's knees should be slightly bent and the shooter should be bending forward at the waist as if preparing to be pushed backward. A left-handed shooter would reverse the hands and the footing, respectively.  Modern technique  The Weaver stance is one of four components of the modern technique of shooting developed by Jeff Cooper. The others are a large- caliber handgun, the flash sight picture, and the compressed surprise break.  History  The Weaver stance was developed in 1959 by pistol shooter and deputy sheriff Jack Weaver, a range officer at the L.A. County Sheriff's Mira Loma pistol range. At the time, Weaver was competing in Jeff Cooper's \\"Leatherslap\\" matches: quick draw, man-on-man competition in which two shooters vied to pop twelve 18\\" wide balloons set up 21 feet away, whichever shooter burst all the balloons first winning the bout. Weaver developed his technique as a way to draw a handgun quickly to eye level and use the weapon's sights to aim more accurately, and immediately began winning against opponents predominantly using unsighted \\"hip shooting\\" techniques. The Weaver technique was dubbed the \\"Weaver Stance\\" by gun writer and firearms instructor Jeff Cooper. Cooper widely publicized the Weaver stance in several of his books, as well as in articles published in the then-fledgling Guns & Ammo magazine. When Cooper started the American Pistol Institute firearms training school, now the Gunsite Training Center, in 1977, his modern technique of the pistol was built around a somewhat formalized \\"Classic Weaver Stance\\". Due to Cooper's influence, the Weaver stance became very popular among firearm professionals and enthusiasts. Though in many firearm related professions the Isosceles Shooting Stance has been favored over the Weaver, it still remains a popular technique among many shooters.  Notes  * Although the Weaver Stance was originally designed for pistols, it can be applied to virtually any type of firearm. However, the main principles of the stance must still be applied (support foot rear at shoulder length with support foot at forty-five degrees while support hand supports the weight of the firearm). This technique has many variations including stances with the support hand carrying a flashlight, knife, baton or other item. * Although this firearm technique is still popular among shooting enthusiasts and firearm professionals, many current firearm instructors favor the Universal Shooting Stance and/or the Isosceles Stance.

Development The mechanism by which exhaust emissions are controlled depends on the method of injection and the point at which air enters the exhaust system, and has varied during the course of the development of the technology. The first systems injected air very close to the engine, either in the cylinder head's exhaust ports or in the exhaust manifold. These systems provided oxygen to oxidize (burn) unburned and partially burned fuel in the exhaust before its ejection from the tailpipe. There was significant unburned and partially burned fuel in the exhaust of 1960s and early 1970s vehicles, and so secondary air injection significantly reduced tailpipe emissions. However, the extra heat of recombustion, particularly with an excessively rich exhaust caused by misfiring or a maladjusted carburetor, tended to damage exhaust valves and could even be seen to cause the exhaust manifold to incandesce. As emission control strategies grew more sophisticated and effective, the amount of unburned and partially burned fuel in the exhaust stream shrank, and particularly when the catalytic converter was introduced, the function of secondary air injection shifted. Rather than being a primary emission control device, the secondary air injection system was adapted to support the efficient function of the catalytic converter. The original air injection point became known as the upstream injection point. When the catalytic converter is cold, air injected at the upstream point burns with the deliberately rich exhaust so as to bring the catalyst up to operating temperature quickly. Once the catalyst is warm, air is injected to the downstream location ‚Äî the catalytic converter itself ‚Äî to assist with catalysis of unburned hydrocarbons. Methods of implementation =Pumped air injection= Pumped air injection systems use a vane pump called the air pump, AIR pump, or colloquially \\"smog pump\\" turned by the engine via a belt or electric motor. The pump's air intake is filtered by a rotating screen or the vehicle air filter to exclude dirt particles large enough to damage the system. Air is delivered under light pressure to the injection point(s). A check valve prevents exhaust forcing its way back through the air injection system, which would damage the pump and other components. Carbureted engines' exhaust raw fuel content tends to spike when the driver suddenly releases the throttle. To prevent the startling and potentially damaging effects of the explosive combustion of this raw fuel, a diverter valve is used. This valve senses the sharp decrease in intake manifold vacuum resulting from the sudden closure of the throttle, and diverts the air pump's outlet to atmosphere. Usually this diverted air is routed to the engine air cleaner or to a separate silencer to muffle objectionable pump noise. =Aspirated air injection= Air injection can also be achieved by taking advantage of the negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system at engine idle. A sensitive reed valve assembly called the aspirator valve is placed in the air injection pumping, which draws its air directly from the clean side of the air filter. During engine idle, brief but periodic negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system draw air through the aspirator valve and into the exhaust stream at the catalytic converter. This system, marketed as Pulse Air, was used by American Motors, Chrysler, and other manufacturers beginning in the 1970s. The aspirator provided advantages in cost, weight, packaging, and simplicity compared to the pump. Also, since there is no pump requiring engine power, parasitic losses associated with the pump are eliminated. However, the aspirator functions only at idle and so admits significantly less air within a significantly narrower range of engine speeds compared to a pump. This system is still used on modern motorcycle engines, e.g. the Yamaha AIS (Air Injection System).

In 1959, he became editor at the \\"Nistru'\\"' magazine, currently \\"Basarabia\\", a publication of the Writers' Union of Moldova. From 1960 to 1963, he served as editor in chief of the \\"Cartea MoldoveneascƒÉ\\" publishing house. In 1967, Vieru's book \\"Poetry for Readers of All Ages\\" (published in 1965) was awarded the Moldavian Prize for Youth Literature. The following year, his book \\"Your Name\\" became part of the contemporary literature curriculum in Moldavian universities. He wrote another children's story/picture book \\"Bread and Dew\\" which features Doru, a 4 or 5-year-old boy who lives in Chi»ôinƒÉu with his parents. Many moldavian composers were inspired by the poetry of Grigore Vieru (songbook \\"Poftim de intra»õi\\", \\"Cine crede\\" etc.), the poet himself is the author of a lot of melodies (\\"SƒÉ cre»ôti mare\\" etc.) and since 1964 he began to collaborate with composer Yulia Tsibulskaya (\\"Soare, soare\\", \\"Clopo»õeii\\", \\"Stea-stea, logostea\\", \\"Ramule-neamule\\", \\"C√Ænt√Ænd cu iubire\\" etc.). He was a frequent guest of the \\"Poetry House\\" in Cociulia village, Cantemir District. The famous book for preschoolers \\"Albinu»õa\\" was also written here. 1968 was turning point for the poet's destiny; this year became remarkable by the volume of lyrical \\"Numele TƒÉu\\" (\\"Your name\\"), with an introductory written by Ion Dru»õƒÉ. The book was appreciated by literary critics as the most original poetic appearance. In the year of it publishing, it became a subject of the study at the university within the courses designated for the contemporary national literature. Three poems in the volume are entitled: Tudor Arghezi, Lucian Blaga, Br√¢ncu»ôi, and another two are dedicated to Nicolae Labi»ô and Marin Sorescu. For the first time, in the post war period, such dedications has appeared in the Bessarabian lyrics.  Political activity  Since 1971, Grigore Vieru has been a member of Communist Party. In 1973, Grigore Vieru has passed the Prut within a delegation of Soviet writers. He participated in the meeting with the editors of the \\"20th Century\\" magazine: Dan HaulicƒÉ, »òtefan Augustin Doina»ô, Ioanichie Olteanu, Geo »òerban, Tatiana Nicolescu. At his request, he has visited monasteries of Putna, Vorone»õ, Sucevi»õa, Dragomirna, VƒÉratec. He returned to Chi»ôinƒÉu with a bag of books. Later the poet makes the following confession: In 1974 and 1977, invited by the president of the Romanian Writers' Union, Vieru visited Bucharest, Constan»õa, Ia»ôi, and cities in Transylvania. In 1978, the \\"Junimea\\" publishing house printed \\"The Friday Star\\", Vieru's first work published in Romania. In 1989 he was elected member of Moldova's Parliament and campaigned for the unification of Romania and Moldova. The following year he was elected Honorary Member of the Romanian Academy.

In 1995, he became a member of the Board of the Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company, and in 1996 he won several Romanian literary awards. In 2000, Vieru was awarded the \\"Eminescu\\" Medal by the Romanian government. = Involvement in the Bessarabia National Liberation Movement = Grigore Vieru, Ion Vatamanu and Serafim Saka in '70. At the end of the 80s, Grigore Vieru is in the first line of the National Liberation Movement in Bessarabia, his texts (including the songs laid on his lyrics) playing a big role in awakening of the national consciousness of Romanians in Bessarabia. Vieru is one of the founders of the People's Front of Moldova and is among the organizers and leaders of the Great National Assembly of August 27, 1989. He actively participates in the debates of the 13th session of the Supreme Soviet of the SSR, in which the Romanian language is voted as the official language and the transition to Latin spelling. Death On January 16, 2009 Vieru suffered a serious traffic accidentDeath Of A Moldovan Poet. rferl.org and was admitted to the Emergency Hospital in Chi»ôinƒÉu. Grigore Vieru was in critical condition with polytrauma, closed cranio-cerebral trauma, cerebral contusion, and closed chest trauma, contusion of the heart and lungs and contusion of the abdominal organs, with minimal chances of survival. The road accident took place on the night of January 15 to 16, at 1:30 am on the R-3 route Chi»ôinƒÉu ‚Äì H√¢nce»ôti ‚Äì Cimi»ôlia ‚Äì Basarabeasca.

Grigore Vieru was buried on January 20, 2009 in Chi»ôinƒÉu, at the Central Cemetery on Armeana street. The funeral were attended by tens of thousands of people, the divisions of Grigore Vieru, as professor Dan Dungaciu called them in his article. Chi»ôinƒÉu had not known such funerals since the burial of the spouses Doina and Ion Aldea Teodorovici. The day of January 20, 2009 was declared a day of mourning in the Republic of Moldova, at 10:00 the whole republic having a moment of silence. Vieru's funeral was also broadcast live by Teleradio Moldova.  Posterity  left Several schools in the Republic of Moldova, a boulevard in Chi»ôinƒÉu and a street in Ia»ôi are called in honour of Grigore Vieru. On February 11, 2010, three days before his birthday, the poet's bust was installed in the Alley of Classics. A street in BuzƒÉu is called in honour of Grigore Vieru: Grigore Vieru Street.  Awards  In 1996 he won several Romanian literary awards, and in the same year on August 23rd, he won Order of the Republic (Moldova). The Romanian president Traian BƒÉsescu has posthumously awarded Grigore Vieru with the Order of the Star of Romania, Grand Cross.  Moments in Vieru's life  thumb In the volume of lyrics designed for children \\"Trei iezi\\" (Three baby goats) published in 1970, there was also the poem called \\"Curcubeul\\" (The Rainbow), in which Vieru, used the metaphor of the rainbow with three colours, praised the flag of all Romanians. In short period of time after the book publishing, the Soviet censorship withdrew the book from the bookstores, and the author was accused of diversion. Also in 1970, has appeared The Abecedarul book developed by Vieru in collaboration with the writer Spiridon Vangheli. Even nowadays, this textbook, which was edited many times over time, still teaches the first class little Bessarabians. In 1989, Vieru and Vangheli also made the Latin alphabet version of The Abecedarul. Vieru wrote, among many others, the lyrics for the soundtrack of the cartoon film Maria, Mirabela, and the Vieru‚Äôs poem \\"DragƒÉ Otee\\" (Dear Otee) has been sung by Iurie Sadovnic. Later, the song was taken over by Zdob »ôi Zdub. In 1988, in the newspaper Literatura ≈üi Arta (Literature and Art) in Chi»ôinƒÉu, the first Latin-written text from post-war Bessarabia has appeared. The author was Grigore Vieru. In June 1989, Vieru has got the approval of the Soviet authorities to publish the weekly Literatura si Arta in Latin writing, the editors of the newspaper mentioned that in all Soviet Moldova there were no typewriter of Latin letters, except the one from the Academy of Sciences of the MSSR and of professor Iulius Popa from BƒÉl»õi. Under these conditions, Grigore Vieru and the editor-in-chief of Literatura »ôi Arta, Nicolae Dabija, went to Bucharest to get the typewriter for the newspaper. The Romanian authorities were delaying the answer, and the antiquarian shop from which they could buy such a device was closed these days because of some technical issues. However, Vieru and Dabija were helped by the priest Vasile »öepordei, who brought to the station a bag containing the 31 metallic signs of the Latin alphabet, cut by him from his own typewriter. In Chi»ôinƒÉu, the Latin signs are welded to a typewriter instead of the Cyrillic ones, so Literatura »ôi Arta magazine became the first newspaper of Bessarabia to start systematically coming out in Latin spelling. In 1994, the neo- communists of the Democratic Agrarian Party, who came to power in Moldova, gave up to the state hymn De»ôteaptƒÉ-te, rom√¢ne! (Awaken thee, Romanian!) and proposed to the poet Grigore Vieru and the composer Eugen Doga to compose the lyrics and music for a new hymn. They both refused.

They are ventral to the dorsal aorta and arise from the aortic sac. The aortic arches are formed sequentially within the pharyngeal arches and initially appear symmetrical on both sides of the embryo, but then undergo a significant remodelling to form the final asymmetrical structure of the great arteries. Structure =Arches 1 and 2= The first and second arches disappear early. A remnant of the 1st arch forms part of the maxillary artery, a branch of the external carotid artery. The ventral end of the second develops into the ascending pharyngeal artery, and its dorsal end gives origin to the stapedial artery, a vessel which typically atrophies in humans but persists in some mammals. The stapedial artery passes through the ring of the stapes and divides into supraorbital, infraorbital, and mandibula branches which follow the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The infraorbital and mandibular branches arise from a common stem, the terminal part of which anastomoses with the external carotid artery. On the obliteration of the stapedial artery, this anastomosis enlarges and forms the internal maxillary artery; branches formerly of the stapedial artery are subsequently considered branches of the internal maxillary artery. The common stem of the infraorbital and mandibular branches passes between the two roots of the auriculotemporal nerve and becomes the middle meningeal artery; the original supraorbital branch of the stapedial is represented by the orbital twigs of the middle meningeal. Note that the external carotid buds from the horns of the aortic sac left behind by the regression of the first two arches. =Arch 3= The third aortic arch constitutes the commencement of the internal carotid artery, and is therefore named the carotid arch. It contributes to the common carotid artery and the proximal portion of the internal carotid artery. =Arch 4= Also known as the systemic arch. The fourth right arch forms the right subclavian as far as the origin of its internal mammary branch. The fourth left arch forms the arch of the aorta between the origin of the left carotid artery and the terminus of the ductus arteriosus. =Arch 5= The fifth arch either never forms or forms incompletely and then regresses. =Arch 6= The proximal part of the sixth right arch persists as the proximal part of the right pulmonary artery while the distal section degenerates; The sixth left arch gives off the left pulmonary artery and forms the ductus arteriosus; this duct remains pervious during the whole of fetal life, but then closes within the first few days after birth due to increased O2 concentration. Oxygen concentration causes the production of bradykinin which causes the ductus to constrict occluding all flow. Within 1‚Äì3 months, the ductus is obliterated and becomes the ligamentum arteriosum. The ductus arteriosus connects at a junction point that has a low pressure zone (commonly called Bernoulli's principle) created by the inferior curvature (inner radius) of the artery. This low pressure region allows the artery to receive (siphon) the blood flow from the pulmonary artery which is under a higher pressure. However, it is extremely likely that the major force driving flow in this artery is the markedly different arterial pressures in the pulmonary and systemic circulations due to the different arteriolar resistances. His showed that in the early embryo the right and left arches each gives a branch to the lungs, but that later both pulmonary arteries take origin from the left arch.  Clinical significance Most defects of the great arteries arise as a result of persistence of aortic arches that normally should regress or regression of arches that normally shouldn't. * Aberrant subclavian artery; with regression of the right aortic arch 4 and the right dorsal aorta, the right subclavian artery has an abnormal origin on the left side, just below the left subclavian artery. To supply blood to the right arm, this forces the right subclavian artery to cross the midline behind the trachea and esophagus, which may constrict these organs, although usually with no clinical symptoms. * A double aortic arch; occurs with the development of an abnormal right aortic arch in addition to the left aortic arch, forming a vascular ring around the trachea and esophagus, which usually causes difficulty breathing and swallowing. Occasionally, the entire right dorsal aorta abnormally persists and the left dorsal aorta regresses in which case the right aorta will have to arch across from the esophagus causing difficulty breathing or swallowing. * Right-sided aortic arch * Patent ductus arteriosus * Coarctation of the aorta Additional images File:Gray474.png|Diagram showing the origins of the main branches of the carotid arteries.

The station's studios are located in downtown Toledo, and its transmitter is located west of Woodville, Ohio. History =Jazzy 97= The Station was originally assigned the call letters WUIA but they were never used. 97.3 FM signed on September 18, 1993 with a Smooth Jazz format known as Jazzy 97, the call letters WJZE matched the station's name. The station was owned by Oak Harbor Community Broadcasting, Inc. The company's name would later change to RASP Broadcasting Enterprises, Inc. Studios and offices were located at 1600 Woodville Road in nearby Millbury. =Classic Rock 97.3 WJZE= WJZE dropped its smooth jazz format for classic rock in mid-1996. A few months prior to the change, 94.5 WXKR had dropped its popular classic rock format for Adult Alternative, leaving Toledo without a full-time classic rock station. The station became simply known as \\"Classic Rock 97.3 WJZE, the station that brought classic rock back to Toledo\\". WJZE did moderately well despite its spotty signal on the west side of town. However, on February 2, 1998, 94.5 WXKR changed its format back to classic rock.

The island has no permanent population, and conditions are said to be harsh and unpleasant.

The plan worked and Moosylvania was saved, giving the series a happy ending. In the fall of 1962, Jay Ward, producer of the Rocky and Bullwinkle show, decided to campaign for statehood for Moosylvania. Ward sent Skip Craig to Minnesota to buy an island in Lake of the Woods. Craig wasn't able to find one for sale on the U.S. side of the lake (most of the islands in that lake belong to Canada), but managed to lease one for three years.

The Clan Tweedie does not currently have a chief recognized by the Lord Lyon King of Arms and is therefore considered an Armigerous clan. However the surname is also considered a sept of the Clan Fraser. The name is derived from the lands of Tweedie which were along the Valley of the River Tweed in Peebleshire in the Scottish Borders. History River Tweed near Drummelzier =Mythical origins of the clan= Scottish tradition ascribes the origin of the Tweedie name to be that of a water sprite in the River Tweed. Legend tells of a husband who went off to fight in the crusades and while he was away his young wife became pregnant and so he returned home to find he had a son. His wife then told him that she had gone down to the banks of the River Tweed and had been accosted by a fairy of the river and become pregnant by him. Her husband, for whatever reason, chose to believe this story but on the condition that the son kept the surname of Tweedie.Sir Walter Scott The BetrothedThe Lay of the Last Minstrel. Appendix, Canto ', Stanza Xiii However the family name was certainly derived from the lands of Tweedie whether the story about the water fairy or spirit is true or not.Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 466‚Äì467. =Early history= The Tweedies have a history of being a powerful and domineering family, whose principal seat was Drumelzier in Tweeddale. The first recorded Tweedie is John de Tueda as he describes himself in the reign of Alexander II (1214‚Äì1249), who afterwards had a Charter from Alexander III (1249‚Äì1286), granted him under the name of John de Tuedy. He was the owner of lands on the River Tweed from which the family took their name, and even then the family connections and possessions were widespread and powerful Finlay de Twydyn appears in the Ragman Rolls of 1296 swearing fealty to King Edward I of England, and his son Roger of Twydyn, received a charter to the house and lands of Drumelzier around 1320. The family held these lands for over 300 years. Chambers in his History of Peebleshire described the Tweedies as being a savage race and another commentator of the eighteenth century described them as being a powerful and domineering family. =Tweedie of Drummelzier= The main centre of the Tweedie family until the 17th century was at Drummelzier, with other branches living at Wrae, Stobo, Dreva, Fruid and other forts and peel towers along the valley. The early history is one of lawlessness, typical of the Scottish borders at that time, with deadly feuds with neighbouring families, particularly the Veitch's. The Tweedies would charge tolls on travellers passing through their territory, be accused or the victims of cattle rustling, and become embroiled in affrays, often fatal, in the streets of Edinburgh. A major incident occurred in 1524 when a large group of Tweedies were involved in the slaughter of Lord Fleming (chief of Clan Fleming) and the abduction of his son Malcolm Fleming, 3rd Lord Fleming ‚Äì the dispute concerning the latter's intention to marry Catherine Fraser who in fact ended up marrying James Tweedie of Drummelzier. In 1592 another James Tweedie of Drumelzier was accused of the murder of Geddes of Glenhegdon in Edinburgh. The complaint against him states that it was not known how many slaughters had been committed by James Tweedie of Drumelzier and his friends. The ancient quarrel with the Veitches still broke out at times, and in 1611 attracted the notice of King James, one of whose last acts before leaving for England was to visit the district of Upper Tweedale with a view to staunching this bloody feud. However a year later it is said James Tweedie lay dead after a duel with Veitch of Dawick. The fortunes of the Drummelzier family declined, and in 1633 the last Tweedie of Drummelzier was forced to sell the Barony of Drummelzier to Lord Hay of Yester. =Tweedie of Oliver= Oliver from Nether Minzion The Tweedies of Oliver Castle descend from a younger son of Drumelzier and they obtained their lands in the parish of Tweedsmuir from the preceptor of Torphichen in the 14th century. In 1524 Thomas Tweedie of Oliver Castle was implicated in the murder of Lord Fleming (chief of Clan Fleming) which erupted into a bloody feud between the two families. Thomas was exiled from Scotland for three years in 1521. His son William is said to have been implicated in the conspiracy to murder Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots. He and Adam Tweedie were among the body of armed men who, headed by Darnley, Morton, Ruthven, and others, on the night of 9 March 1566, rushed into the Palace at Holyrood and in the Queen's presence assassinated David Rizzio, her foreign Secretary and favourite musician. Along with the other conspirators, they were summoned on 19 March following to appear personally before the King and Queen and the Lords of the Secret Council to answer for the crime. Subsequently, the Tweedies of Oliver adopted a more settled existence as comparatively prosperous landowners. In 1745 the Laird of that time, Thomas Tweedie, and other members of the family were careful to avoid any involvement in the Jacobite rising when Highland clans crossed the valley. However Tweedies attestation to the considerate and respectful behaviour Captain John Burnet of Colonel Grant's Highland Regiment on that occasion may have contributed to the latter's subsequent pardon. =Later descent from Oliver= Tweedie stones in Tweedsmuir church yard This Thomas Tweedie married Mary Stevenson daughter of Alexander Stevenson of Venlaw Castle Their eldest son James inherited Oliver, but the line died out with Lawrence Tweedie (died 1837) who bequeathed Oliver to his nephew George Stodart provided he took the surname Tweedie and quartered the arms. The resulting Tweedie-Stodart descent has also since died out. Thomas Tweedie's second son, another Thomas who lived at Kingledoors, is the antecedent of most of the Tweedies of Oliver descent through his son Alexander. Of Alexander's three sons, Thomas Stevenson Tweedie (1784‚Äì1855) became a surgeon in the East India Company. He had a family through an Anglo- Indian wife which he later disowned, and another family in Scotland. He added largely to the Quarter estate by purchasing many ancient possessions of the family, Kingledoors, Glenrath and Wrae, and also Rachan. His brother Maurice Tweedie (1787‚Äì1867) was a major general in the Indian Army who was Resident at Tanjore, served through the Coorg Campaign and other fighting, and commanded troops at Penang, Singapore, and Malacca. The third brother Michael Tweedie (1791‚Äì1874) also a soldier served in the Royal Artillery during the Peninsular War (1808‚Äì14). He married Frances Forbes and moved the Kent, establishing the Rawlinson Rolvenden line. Michael Tweedie's son, another Michael Tweedie (1836‚Äì1917), was a major-general in the 1850s, throughout the Crimean War and during the Indian Mutiny. His son Admiral Sir Hugh Tweedie (1877‚Äì1951) had a distinguished naval career in the Royal Navy ‚Äì he was aide-de-camp to King George V in 1925 and retired as an admiral in 1936, but was recalled at the outbreak of World War II. He was created a Knight of the Bath, in addition to holding the French Legion of Honour and the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun. Michael Forbes Tweedie, grandson of the first Michael Tweedie, is noted as the author of the Tweedie family history in 1902. Another descendant of the first Michael Tweedie was the naturalist Michael Tweedie, director of the Raffles Museum in Singapore. Another Tweedie line, which is closely connected to Oliver, stems from Alexander Tweedie (died 1740) of Nether Minzion via his son James. James‚Äô son Alexander Tweedie (1759‚Äì1811) moved to Dreva, and his son James Tweedie of Coates gave rise to families in Scotland and Chicago. A second son Thomas Tweedie (1760‚Äì1848) moved to Patavan and also had widely dispersed descendants. Several others with the name Tweedie, identified in Peebles, surrounding areas of Peebleshire and Edinburgh up to the 19th century are most likely offshoots of the Tweed valley family.

George's exact relationship to the Tweedies of Drummelzier has not been established. His great grandson, William Twedy, died in 1605 and is buried at Little Sampford, Essex. His memorial describes him as a distinguished military commander first under Queen Elizabeth of glorious memory in suppressing the tumults of the north of England, next under the invincible hero the Lord Baron de Willoughby in France, and lastly under the auspices of the illustrious Earl of Leicester, in the Netherlands, and was Warden of the military works at Bergen-op-Zoom. The family remained in Essex until the 16th century, when it moved to Yorkshire before returning to the South of England in the 18th century. The family was centred on Bromley, Kent. Colonel George Tweedy HEIC lived at Bromley House, John Newman Tweedy lived at Widmore House and his son, Arthur Hearne Tweedy, at Widmore Lodge. The family's connection with Bromley is commemorated by the naming of Tweedy Road in the centre of the town. Arthur Hearne Tweedy died in 1925 unmarried, and the family is now represented by Captain Christopher John Tweedy, late of the Black Watch. =Other branches= In addition to the Tweedie families listed above, Michael Forbes Tweedie recorded the following pedigrees in his book The History of the Tweedie or Tweedy Family: :The Descendants Of The Rev.

It is a small maple with deciduous leaves that is sometimes grown as a garden subject or boulevard tree.  Description  Acer ginnala is a deciduous spreading shrub or small tree growing to tall, with a short trunk up to diameter and slender branches. The bark is thin, dull gray-brown, and smooth at first but becoming shallowly fissured on old plants. The leaves are opposite and simple, long and wide, deeply palmately lobed with three or five lobes, of which two small basal lobes (sometimes absent) and three larger apical lobes; the lobes are coarsely and irregularly toothed, and the upper leaf surface glossy. The leaves turn brilliant orange to red in autumn, and are on slender, often pink-tinged, petioles long. The flowers are yellow-green, diameter, produced in spreading panicles in spring as the leaves open. The fruit is a paired reddish samara, long with a wing, maturing in late summer to early autumn..  Taxonomy  Amur maple is closely related to Acer tataricum (Tatar maple), and some botanists treat it as a subspecies A. tataricum subsp. ginnala (Maxim.) Wesm. The glossy, deeply lobed leaves of A. ginnala distinguish it from A. tataricum, which has matte, unlobed or only shallowly lobed leaves.  Cultivation and uses  Acer ginnala is grown as an ornamental plant in northern regions of Europe and North America. It is the most cold-tolerant maple, hardy to zone 2. It is naturalised in parts of North America. Planted on exceptional sites facing south west with consistent moisture and light loamy soils, this tree can grow 3 to 4 feet per year making it a fast grower. It is often planted as a shrub along borders. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is also valued in Japan and elsewhere as a species suitable for bonsai. It is a nonnative invasive species in parts of northern America.  Cultivars  Due to its vigor and fall colors of yellows and bright reds, the size being a small tree of 6 metres (20 feet) wide by 6 m tall on average, it suits many for smaller landscapes and for planting under power lines. Cultivars have emerged for those wanting these attributes. * Flame (Fiery red autumn foliage, very strong vigor)  References  *  External links   Winter ID pictures ginnala Flora of Mongolia Flora of China Flora of the Russian Far East Flora of Eastern Asia Plants used in bonsai Garden plants of Asia ","title":"Acer ginnala"},{"id":"4041339","text":"Monsoon is the fifth studio album and first major label album by American alternative rock band Caroline's Spine.

The film is a loose remake of the 1948 comedy film by Cary Grant, Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, and a sequel to the 2005 film Are We There Yet? The screenplay is by Hank Nelken. It was produced by Revolution Studios and RKO Pictures and distributed by Columbia Pictures. The film was shot on location in Tsawwassen, British Columbia, Canada, but is set in Newberg, Oregon, United States. Plot Two years after the events of the first film, Nick Persons (Ice Cube) has married Suzanne (Nia Long) and moved her children, Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden), and Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) into his apartment, as well as purchasing a 2007 Cadillac Escalade after he accidentally burnt up his Lincoln Navigator SUV. He has also sold his sports memorabilia store to his friend, Marty. The family has also bought a Berger Picard pet dog and named it Coco. Kevin and Lindsey have both matured since the previous film. While getting ready for an interview with Magic Johnson to launch a sports magazine, Suzanne tells Nick that she is pregnant and they later find out that they will be having twins. Needing more space, Suzanne and Nick go check out a house in the suburbs. They meet Chuck Mitchell Jr. (John C. McGinley), a local real estate agent/contractor, and after some talking, Nick decides to buy the house. The family then packs up their things and moves into the house, with Lindsey and Kevin (mostly the former) being against the move. However, as it turns out, Nick failed to get the house inspected first, and they soon find a mold infestation. While trying to resolve the mold issue, Chuck discovers even more problems with the house, and Nick becomes angry with him as he almost destroys it trying to fix them all. Meanwhile, Lindsey sneaks out to go to a party with Chuck‚Äôs teenage employees, and when Nick finds out, he grounds her. Nick finally decides to fire Chuck, which causes all those working on the house to quit out of loyalty to Chuck, and Suzanne to take the kids and move into the guest house. After taking some time to think, Nick decides to fix the house on his own and also to apologize to Chuck, especially when he was told that his wife, a famous country singer, died a few years ago. Chuck responds by bringing his friends back to help. When Suzanne goes into labor, with the hospital half-an-hour away, Nick, Kevin, and Lindsey have to deliver the babies. Chuck tries to get there, but his truck breaks down and he is forced to power walk down to the house. While she's still in labor, Nick gets a call from Magic Johnson. After Suzanne gives birth to identical twin boys, the movie ends six months later with a big BBQ in their backyard, at which Nick debuts his new magazine titled Are We Done Yet?, based on his experience building the house.

Reception Like its predecessor, Are We Done Yet? was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 8% based on 92 reviews, and has an average rating of 3.34/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Are We Done Yet? plays it way too safe with generic slapstick and uninspired domestic foibles.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a higher score than its predecessor's, at 36 out of 100, based on 21 reviews, meaning \\"generally unfavorable reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Neil Smith for BBC.com gave the film 1 out of 5 stars and wrote: \\"McGinley, as it happens, is the film's only trump card, his madcap multi tasker stealing every scene he's in and leaving the movie's nominal star for dead.\\" In one of the few positive reviews, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave the film a grade B, and praises McGinley and calls Ice Cube's performance \\"strangely charming\\".

Blake is located on three campuses around the Twin Cities area of Minnesota: the upper school (9‚Äì12) is in Minneapolis; administration offices, middle school (6‚Äì8) is in Hopkins, Minnesota, and half of the lower school is also in Hopkins, Minnesota connected to the middle school; and the other half of the lower school is in Wayzata, Minnesota. History Early Blake boys studying During the early 20th century, two schools were founded in Minneapolis to prepare students for elite colleges in the Northeast: the Blake School for boys and Northrop Collegiate School for girls. A third school, Highcroft Country Day School serving students of both sexes, was incorporated during the migration to Minneapolis suburbs. In 1974, the three schools merged to become the Blake Schools, with its first coeducational class graduating in 1975. =Blake= The Blake Campus, home to the Middle School and one of the two Lower Schools, Hopkins In 1907, William M. Blake established the Blake School, a private, preparatory school for boys, in Minneapolis. Three years later, Charles C. Bovey, a local businessman, wanted to reform Blake, and put it on the same plane as Eastern preparatory schools. With help from William Blake, Bovey asked sixteen other local business leaders to contribute $2,500 each towards the school's first capital drive. In 1911, these original guarantors hired Charles B. Newton, a Princeton and Harvard alumnus, to replace William Blake as headmaster. Newton envisioned a school \\"not only for the wealthy, but for the worthy.\\" The school incorporated on May 5, 1911, with all but two guarantors serving on the Board of Trustees. In 1912, their pooled resources enabled the construction of a new building in suburban Hopkins, with the site, now known as Blake Campus, being the current home of the middle school and one of the two lower school campuses. =Northrop= Northrop building in 1916 In 1900, Zulema A. Ruble, a Smith College alumna, and Carrie Bartlett established Graham Hall, a private school for girls, in Minneapolis. In 1914, a group of Minneapolis leaders purchased Graham Hall and incorporated it as Northrop Collegiate School. In 1917, the school relocated within Minneapolis, with the site, now known as Northrop Campus, being the current home of the upper school campus. Field hockey on Northrop in 1918 =Highcroft= In 1958, Sage Cowles, wife of John Cowles, Jr., along with two friends, established Highcroft Country Day School, a private, coeducational, nonsectarian K-9 school in Wayzata. Highcroft was designed to provide students in the far western suburbs (at the time) of the Twin Cities with an education near home. In 1960, the school building was constructed on land purchased and donated to the school, part of which was the former Highcroft estate in Wayzata, with the site, now known as Highcroft Campus, being the current home of the other lower school campus. =Preservation and present= Some spectators arriving at Blake's Gordy Aamoth Jr. Memorial Stadium In addition to retaining the original sites of the three schools as part of the campuses of the Blake School, the school also carries on other traditions, such as: * from the Blake School for the boys ‚Äì strong speech and debate programs, which are still maintained as an ongoing graduation requirement * from Northrop Collegiate School ‚Äì strong drama program, mascot of bears, along with the school color of blue * from Highcroft Country Day School ‚Äì growing athletic program for both boys and girls, along with school color of green.

It is famous for being the oldest (or one of the oldest) known samples of the use of the Greek alphabet. The text is scratched on a oenochoe, which was found in 1871 and is named after the location where it was found, the ancient Dipylon Cemetery, near the Dipylon Gate on the area of Kerameikos in Athens. The jug is attributed to the Late Geometrical Period (750-700 BC). It is now in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens (inv. 192). Text The text is written in an archaic form of the Greek alphabet, with some letter shapes still resembling those of the original Phoenician alphabet. For example, the Greek letter zeta (Œñ) resembles the Phoenician letter zayin (I). The text is written from right to left, with the individual letters mirror-shaped in comparison with the modern forms. It is placed in a circle around the shoulder of the vessel. The text consists of 46 characters, of which the first 35 can easily be read as a hexametric verse in Greek. The fragmentary rest is believed to have been the beginning of the second verse of a distichon, but the exact interpretation is unclear. B. Powell has argued that the final characters may represent a garbled snippet from the middle of an abecedarium (ŒöŒõŒúŒù) by a second hand, someone learning to write.Powell, 1988. More recently, N. M. Binek has shown that the last six markings can \\"be viewed not as letters or as attempts to inscribe letters, but rather as decorative elements fashioned by a second inscriber in accordance with the principles of Geometric idiom,\\" inasmuch as the segment roughly mirrors the shapes of letters 9-4 (ŒßŒ°ŒüŒùŒ•Œù).Binek, 2017, pp. 423, 430-31 The text marks the vessel as a prize in a dancing competition.

Up until the mid-1990s, the majority of programming languages used in industry supported manual memory management, though garbage collection has existed since 1959, when it was introduced with Lisp. Today, however, languages with garbage collection such as Java are increasingly popular and the languages Objective-C and Swift provide similar functionality through Automatic Reference Counting. The main manually managed languages still in widespread use today are C and C++ ‚Äì see C dynamic memory allocation. Description All programming languages use manual techniques to determine when to allocate a new object from the free store. C uses the \`malloc\` function; C++ and Java use the \`new\` operator; and many other languages (such as Python) allocate all objects from the free store. Determining when an object ought to be created (object creation) is generally trivial and unproblematic, though techniques such as object pools mean an object may be created before immediate use. The real challenge is object destruction ‚Äì determination of when an object is no longer needed (i.e. is garbage), and arranging for its underlying storage to be returned to the free store for re- use. In manual memory allocation, this is also specified manually by the programmer; via functions such as \`free()\` in C, or the \`delete\` operator in C++ ‚Äì this contrasts with automatic destruction of objects held in automatic variables, notably (non-static) local variables of functions, which are destroyed at the end of their scope in C and C++. Manual management and correctness Manual memory management is known to enable several major classes of bugs into a program when used incorrectly, notably violations of memory safety or memory leaks. These are a significant source of security bugs. * When an unused object is never released back to the free store, this is known as a memory leak. In some cases, memory leaks may be tolerable, such as a program which \\"leaks\\" a bounded amount of memory over its lifetime, or a short-running program which relies on an operating system to deallocate its resources when it terminates. However, in many cases memory leaks occur in long-running programs, and in such cases an unbounded amount of memory is leaked. When this occurs, the size of the available free store continues to decrease over time; when it is finally exhausted, the program then crashes. * Catastrophic failure of the dynamic memory management system may result when an object's backing memory is deleted out from under it more than once; an object is explicitly destroyed more than once; when, while using a pointer to manipulate an object not allocated on the free store, a programmer attempts to release said pointer's target object's backing memory; or when, while manipulating an object via a pointer to another, arbitrary area of memory managed by an unknown external task, thread, or process, a programmer corrupts that object's state, possibly in such a way as to write outside of its bounds and corrupt its memory management data. The result of such actions can include heap corruption, premature destruction of a different (and newly created) object which happens to occupy the same location in memory as the multiply deleted object, program crashes due to a segmentation fault (violation of memory protection,) and other forms of undefined behavior. * Pointers to deleted objects become wild pointers if used post-deletion; attempting to use such pointers can result in difficult-to-diagnose bugs. Languages which exclusively use garbage collection are known to avoid the last two classes of defects. Memory leaks can still occur (and bounded leaks frequently occur with generational or conservative garbage collection), but are generally less severe than memory leaks in manual systems. Resource Acquisition Is Initialization Manual memory management has one correctness advantage, which is that it allows automatic resource management via the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) paradigm. This arises when objects own scarce system resources (like graphics resources, file handles, or database connections) which must be relinquished when an object is destroyed ‚Äì when the lifetime of the resource ownership should be tied to the lifetime of the object. Languages with manual management can arrange this by acquiring the resource during object initialization (in the constructor), and releasing during object destruction (in the destructor), which occurs at a precise time. This is known as Resource Acquisition Is Initialization. This can also be used with deterministic reference counting. In C++, this ability is put to further use to automate memory deallocation within an otherwise-manual framework, use of the \`shared_ptr\` template in the language's standard library to perform memory management is a common paradigm. \`shared_ptr\` is not suitable for all object usage patterns, however. This approach is not usable in most garbage collected languages ‚Äì notably tracing garbage collectors or more advanced reference counting ‚Äì due to finalization being non-deterministic, and sometimes not occurring at all. That is, it is difficult to define (or determine) when or if a finalizer method might be called; this is commonly known as the finalizer problem. Java and other GC'd languages frequently use manual management for scarce system resources besides memory via the dispose pattern: any object which manages resources is expected to implement the \`dispose()\` method, which releases any such resources and marks the object as inactive. Programmers are expected to invoke \`dispose()\` manually as appropriate to prevent \\"leaking\\" of scarce graphics resources. Depending on the \`finalize()\` method (how Java implements finalizers) to release graphics resources is widely viewed as poor programming practice among Java programmers, and similarly the analogous \`__del__()\` method in Python cannot be relied on for releasing resources. For stack resources (resources acquired and released within a single block of code), this can be automated by various language constructs, such as Python's \`with\`, C#'s \`using\` or Java's \`try\`-with-resources. Performance Many advocates of manual memory management argue that it affords superior performance when compared to automatic techniques such as garbage collection. Traditionally latency was the biggest advantage, but this is no longer the case. Manual allocation frequently has superior locality of reference. Manual allocation is also known to be more appropriate for systems where memory is a scarce resource, due to faster reclamation. Memory systems can and do frequently \\"thrash\\" as the size of a program's working set approaches the size of available memory; unused objects in a garbage-collected system remain in an unreclaimed state for longer than in manually managed systems, because they are not immediately reclaimed, increasing the effective working set size. Manual management has a number of documented performance disadvantages: * Calls to \`delete\` and such incur an overhead each time they are made, this overhead can be amortized in garbage collection cycles. This is especially true of multithreaded applications, where delete calls must be synchronized. * The allocation routine may be more complicated, and slower. Some garbage collection schemes, such as those with heap compaction, can maintain the free store as a simple array of memory (as opposed to the complicated implementations required by manual management schemes). Latency is a debated point that has changed over time, with early garbage collectors and simple implementations performing very poorly compared to manual memory management, but sophisticated modern garbage collectors often performing as well or better than manual memory management. Manual allocation does not suffer from the long \\"pause\\" times that occur in simple stop-the-world garbage collection, although modern garbage collectors have collection cycles which are often not noticeable. Manual memory management and garbage collection both suffer from potentially unbounded deallocation times ‚Äì manual memory management because deallocating a single object may require deallocating its members, and recursively its members' members, etc., while garbage collection may have long collection cycles. This is especially an issue in real time systems, where unbounded collection cycles are generally unacceptable; real-time garbage collection is possible by pausing the garbage collector, while real-time manual memory management requires avoiding large deallocations, or manually pausing deallocation.

It was created through the initiative of Benedicto Arystogogo de Mello, who had already founded the settlements of Riverl√¢ndia, in Rio Verde, and Vila Brasil, in Santa Helena de Goi√°s. Mello negotiated with a large landowner of the region to begin selling the lots. The lands were on the banks of the Rio Verd√£o and near the Bras√≠lia ‚Äì Acre highway, which was under construction at the time. Origin of the name The name of the town, Acre√∫na, comes from a combination of Acre, final destination of the highway which crosses the town, and Una, a tribute to Para√∫na, the municipality where it had been located before becoming a separate municipality. It became a district in 1968 and, thanks to its rapid population growth and economic development, it separated from Para√∫na in 1976 to become an independent municipality.

He is currently Secretary-General of Chadian Action for Unity and Socialism (ACTUS), a left-wing opposition party. Life Moungar is an ethnic Sara, born in 1948 in Doba in the Logone Oriental Region, who has practiced as a surgeon in France. He started his political career when, along with other exiles, he founded ACTUS, a party hostile to both the FROLINAT and Wadel Abdelkader Kamougu√©'s de facto government of southern Chad, the Comit√© Permanente du Sud, in May 1979 in Paris. In 1992, two years after the rise to the presidency of Idriss D√©by, he became Minister of Education in the government led by Jean Alingu√© Bawoyeu.Amnesty International Report 1994 - Chad, UNHCR web site. At the Sovereign National Conference (CNS), a reconciliation conference representing most Chadian factions that was first convened on January 15, 1993, Moungar was elected as transitional Prime Minister on April 6, 1993, receiving 444 votes against the 334 received by Adoum Helbongo.Bernard Lanne, \\"Chad: Regime Change, Increased Insecurity, and Blockage of Further Reforms\\", Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. Clark and Gardinier, page 278. He succeeded Alingu√© as the 5th Prime Minister of Chad on April 7.Guy Arnold, Chad, Year in Review: 1993, Britannica.com. Moungar formed a transitional government including 16 ministers, in which all party leaders had a post; among these, Saleh Kebzabo became Trade and Industry Minister, Delwa Kassir√© Koumakoye became Communications Minister and Wadel Abdelkader Kamougu√© became Civil Service and Labour Minister. In a message on Radio Tchad, Moungar asserted his cabinet's loyalty to the CNS' instructions, claiming that his ministers would be the CNS' \\"missionaries\\". Moungar's tenure in office was marked by confrontation with the President over the pace for adopting a multiparty political system, a confrontation that a Chadian journalist dates from June, when during a presidential visit to France Idriss D√©by noted that Moungar was highly regarded by the French government. This made D√©by conclude that Moungar might transform himself in a dangerous rival for the presidency. He was also led to suspect this, together with rival opposition leaders, by Moungar's conduct and speeches, which indicated a considerable ambition, despite his previous promise that he had no political interest in remaining in politics after the transition period. This brought the downfall of the Moungar cabinet on October 28, 1993, when the President's supporters presented a censure motion in transitional parliament, the Conseil Sup√©rieur de Transition (CST).Buijtenhuijs, Robert; La Conf√©rence nationale souveraine du Tchad: un essai d'histoire imm√©diate, 207-208 The CST (the country's transitional legislature charged with the task of monitoring the government's implementation of the CNS' recommendations) approved the motion with 45 votes against 10, and 1 abstained, displaying what the scholar William Miles calls \\"a good example of their deference to the Presidency\\", which repeated itself when the CST readily accepted D√©by's candidate for Prime Minister, the Justice Minister Delwa Kassir√© Koumakoye. Moungar called his removal unconstitutional, threatening to bring the issue to court, while workers went on strike, deserting their jobs. In 1996 Moungar was disqualified from participating in the first Chadian multi-party presidential election for alleged residence irregularities.C. Daddieh & K. Mengisteab, State Building and Democratization in Africa, page 180. In January 2007 Moungar strongly criticized French policy in Chad, asking for the recall of the French troops stationed in Chad.

Plot Peter P. Peters (Fred Astaire), an American ballet dancer billed as \\"Petrov\\", dances for a ballet company in Paris owned by the bumbling Jeffrey Baird (Edward Everett Horton). Peters secretly wants to blend classical ballet with modern jazz dancing, and when he sees a photo of famous tap dancer Linda Keene (Ginger Rogers), he falls in love with her. He contrives to meet her, but she is less than impressed. They meet again on an ocean liner traveling back to New York, and Linda warms to Petrov. Unknown to them, a plot is launched as a publicity stunt \\"proving\\" that they are actually married. Outraged, Linda becomes engaged to the bumbling Jim Montgomery (William Brisbane), much to the chagrin of both Peters and Arthur Miller (Jerome Cowan), her manager, who secretly launches more fake publicity. Peters and Keene, unable to squelch the rumor, decide to actually marry and then immediately get divorced. Linda begins to fall in love with her husband, but then discovers him with another woman, Lady Denise Tarrington (Ketti Gallian), and leaves before he can explain. Later, when she comes to his new show to personally serve him divorce papers, she sees him dancing with dozens of women, all wearing masks with her face on them: Peters has decided that if he cannot dance with Linda, he will dance with images of Linda. Seeing that he truly loves her, she happily joins him onstage.

Ira Gershwin seemed decidedly less excited by the idea; none of his lyrics make reference to the notion of blending different styles of dance (such as ballet and jazz), and Astaire was also not enthusiastic about the concept. The score of Shall We Dance is probably the largest source of Gershwin orchestral works unavailable to the general public, at least since the advent of modern stereo recording techniques in the 1950s. The movie contains the only recordings of some of the instrumental pieces currently available to Gershwin aficionados (although not all the incidental music composed for the movie was used in the final cut.) Some of the cuts arranged and orchestrated by Gershwin include: \\"Dance of the Waves\\", \\"Waltz of the Red Balloons\\", \\"Graceful and Elegant\\", \\"Hoctor's Ballet\\" and \\"French Ballet Class\\". The instrumental track \\"Walking the Dog\\", however, has been frequently recorded and has been played from time to time on classical music radio stations. Nathaniel Shilkret, musical director for the movie, hired Jimmy Dorsey and all or part of the Dorsey band as the nucleus of a fifty-piece studio orchestra including strings. Dorsey was in Hollywood at the time working the \\"Kraft Music Hall\\" radio show on NBC hosted by Bing Crosby. Dorsey is heard soloing on \\"Slap That Bass,\\" \\"Walking the Dog\\" and \\"They All Laughed.\\" Gershwin was already suffering during the production of the motion picture from the brain tumor that was shortly to kill him, and Shilkret (as well as Robert Russell Bennett) contributed by assisting with orchestration on some of the numbers. =Musical numbers= Hermes Pan collaborated with Astaire on the choreography throughout and Harry Losee was brought in to help with the ballet finale. Gershwin modeled the score on the great ballets of the 19th century, but with obvious swing and jazz influences, as well as polytonalism. While Astaire made further attempts‚Äînotably in Ziegfeld Follies (1944/46), Yolanda and the Thief (1945) and Daddy Long Legs (1955)‚Äîit was his rival and friend Gene Kelly who would eventually succeed in creating a modern original dance style based on this concept. Some critics have attributed Astaire's discomfort with ballet (he briefly studied ballet in the 1920s) to his oft-expressed disdain for \\"inventing up to the arty\\". * \\"Overture to Shall We Dance\\":was written by George Gershwin in 1937 as the introduction to his score for Shall We Dance. Performance time runs about four minutes. \\"The opening [number] is in Gershwin's best big-city style; propulsive, nervous, bustling with modern harmonies; it might have easily been developed into a full-scale composition except that time was growing short.\\"Jablonski 1998, p. 304. * \\"French Ballet Class\\" written in the style of the galop. * \\"Rehearsal Fragments\\": In a brief segment which seeks to motivate the film's core dance concept, Astaire illustrates the idea of combining \\"the technique of ballet with the warmth and passion of this other mood\\" by performing two ballet leaps, the second of which is followed by a tap barrage. * \\"Rumba Sequence\\": Astaire watches a flip book showing a brief orchestral rumba danced by Ginger Rogers and Pete Theodore, choreographed by Hermes Pan; it is Rogers' only partnered dance without Astaire in the ten-film series of Astaire-Rogers musicals. The increasing complexity and chromaticism in Gershwin's music can be detected between music for this sequence and Gershwin's earlier effort at a rumba, the Cuban Overture, written five years earlier. Scored for chamber orchestra. * \\"(I've Got) Beginner's Luck\\": A brief comic tap solo with cane where Astaire's rehearsing to a record of the number is cut short when the record gets stuck. * \\"Waltz of the Red Balloons\\" written in the style of a valse joyeaux. * \\"Slap That Bass\\": In a mixed race number unusual for its time, Astaire encounters a group of African-American musicians holding a jam session in a spotless, Art Deco-inspired ship's engine room. Dudley Dickerson introduces the first verse of the song whose chorus is then taken up by Astaire. The virtuoso tap solo which follows is the first substantial musical number in the picture, and can be seen as a successor to the \\"I'd Rather Lead A Band\\" solo from Follow the Fleet (1936)‚Äîwhich also took place aboard ship‚Äîthis time introducing a vertical element to the predominantly linear choreography, some pointedly dismissive references to ballet positions, and a middle section similarly without musical accompaniment but now imaginatively supported by rhythmic engine noises. George Gershwin's color home-movie footage of Astaire rehearsing this number was discovered only in the 1990s. * \\"Dance of the Waves\\": written in the style of a barcarolle. * \\"Walking the Dog\\": This was only published in 1960 as \\"Promenade\\" to accompany two pantomimic routines for Astaire and Rogers. This is the only part of the score besides Hoctor's Ballet to be published for performance in the concert hall, thus far. Scored for chamber orchestra. (Not all of the Walking the Dog sequence heard in the movie is in the published score, the ending of the scene features the themes following each other in a round (music).) * \\"Beginner's Luck\\" (song): Astaire delivers this song to a non-committal Rogers, whose skepticism is echoed by a pack of howling dogs intervening at the close. * \\"Graceful and Elegant\\": another waltz written by Gershwin, this one written in the style of the pas de deux (the first of two pas de deux in the score) * \\"They All Laughed (at Christopher Columbus)\\": Ginger Rogers sings the introduction of Gershwin's now-classic song and is then joined by Astaire in a comic dance duet which begins with a ballet parody: Astaire in a mock-Russian accent invites Rogers to \\"tweeest\\" but after she pointedly fails to respond the pair revert to a tap routine which ends with Astaire lifting Rogers onto a piano. * \\"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\\": The genesis of the joke in Ira Gershwin's famous lyrics is uncertain: Ira has claimed the idea occurred to him in 1926 and remained unused. Astaire and Rogers sing alternate verses of this quickstep before embarking on a partnered comic tap dance on roller skates in a Central Park skating rink. Astaire uses the circular form of the rink to introduce a variation of the \\"oompah-trot\\" he and his sister Adele had made famous in vaudeville. In a further dig at ballet, the pair strike an arabesque pose just prior to toppling onto the grass. * \\"They Can't Take That Away from Me\\": The Gershwins' famous foxtrot, a serene, nostalgic declaration of love;one of their most enduring creations and one of George's personal favorites‚Äîis introduced by Astaire. As with \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" in Swing Time (1936), it was decided to reprise the melody as part of the film's dance finale. George Gershwin was unhappy about this, writing \\"They literally throw one or two songs away without any kind of plug\\". Astaire and Rogers said individually during their lives the song was one of their favourite personal songs, and they rescued it for The Barkleys of Broadway in (1949), his final reunion with Rogers, creating one of their most admired essays in romantic partnered dance, and it remains the only occasion on film when Astaire permitted himself to repeat a song he had performed in a previous film. George Gershwin died two months after the film's release, and he was posthumously nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for this song at the 1937 Academy Awards. * \\"Hoctor's Ballet\\": The film's big production number begins with a ballet featuring a female chorus and ballet soloist Harriet Hoctor whose specialty was performing an elliptical backbend en pointe, a routine she had perfected during her vaudeville days and as a headline act with the Ziegfeld Follies. Astaire approaches and the pair perform a duet to a reprise of the music to \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me.\\" This number runs directly into: * \\"Shall We Dance/ Finale and Coda\\": After a brief routine for Astaire and a female chorus, each wearing Ginger masks, he departs and Hoctor returns to deliver two variations on her backbend routine. Astaire now returns in top hat, white tie and tails and delivers a rendition of the title song; urging his audience to \\"drop that long face/come on have your fling/why keep nursing the blues\\" and follows this with a zestful half-minute tap solo. Other musical nods are interwoven referencing the previous ballet sequences. Finally, Ginger arrives on stage, masked to blend in with the chorus whereupon Astaire unmasks her and they dance a brief final duet. This routine was referenced in the 1999 romantic comedy Simply Irresistible. Production While the film - the couple's most expensive to date - benefits from quality comedy specialists, opulent art direction by Carroll Clark under Van Nest Polglase's supervision, and a timeless score which introduces three classic Gershwin songs, the convoluted plot and the curious absence of a romantic partnered duet for Astaire and Rogers - a hallmark of their musicals since The Gay Divorcee (1934) - contributed to their least profitable picture to date. Astaire was no stranger to the Gershwins, having headlined, with his sister Adele, two Gershwin Broadway shows: Lady Be Good! in 1924 and Funny Face in 1927. George Gershwin also accompanied the pair on piano in a set of recordings in 1926. Rogers first came to Hollywood's attention when she appeared in the Gershwins' 1930 stage musical Girl Crazy.\\"Girl Crazy\\" at the Internet Broadway Database Shall We Dance was named at the suggestion of Vincente Minnelli, who was a friend of the Gershwins. Minnelli originally suggested \\"Shall We Dance?\\" with a question mark, which disappeared at some point. Reception Shall We Dance earned $1,275,000 in the US and Canada and $893,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $413,000, less than half the previous Astaire-Rogers film. It was neither a box office nor a critical success, and was taken as an indication that the Astaire-Rogers pairing was slipping in its audience appeal.McGee, Scott. \\"Articles: 'Shall We Dance' (1937).\\" TCM.com.

Page was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her two-scene role. The film was adapted by screenwriter Vincent Patrick from his novel of the same name. Plot In an Italian neighborhood of Greenwich Village, cousins Charlie (Rourke), a ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel with aspirations of someday owning his own restaurant, and Paulie (Roberts), a schemer who works as a waiter, have expensive tastes but not much money. Paulie gets caught skimming checks, and he and Charlie are both fired. Now out of work and in debt, Charlie must find another way to pay his alimony, support his pregnant girlfriend Diane (Hannah), and try to buy a restaurant. Paulie comes to Charlie with a \\"can't-miss\\" robbery, involving a large amount of cash in the safe of a local business. Charlie reluctantly agrees to participate, and they manage to crack the safe with help from an accomplice, Barney (McMillan), a clock repairman and locksmith. But things go sour, resulting in the accidental death of police officer Walter \\"Bunky\\" Ritter, who had been secretly taping \\"Bed Bug\\" Eddie Grant (Young). Charlie soon learns that the money they stole belongs to Eddie. The mob figures out that Paulie is involved, and not even his Uncle Pete, part of Eddie's crew, can help him. Eddie's henchmen cut off Paulie's left thumb as punishment. Diane leaves Charlie and takes his money to support their unborn child, while Paulie is forced to work as a waiter for Eddie. He gives the mob Barney's name but initially refuses to identify Charlie as the third man involved. However, under pressure, he is forced to rat on his cousin. Barney leaves town and Charlie mails him his cut of the loot. And when Charlie makes $20,000 on a horse, things begin to look up. Charlie prepares for a showdown with Eddie, armed with a copy of the tape that the police officer made. But at the last moment, Paulie puts lye in Eddie's coffee.

He posited that the blocks of the Great Pyramid are not carved stone but mostly a form of limestone concrete or man-made stone. He holds the Ordre National du M√©rite.  Limestone concrete hypothesis  Davidovits believes that the blocks of the pyramid are not carved stone, but mostly a form of limestone concrete and that they were \\"cast\\" as with modern concrete.M. W. Barsoum, A. Ganguly & G. Hug, (2006), Microstructural Evidence of Reconstituted Limestone Blocks in the Great Pyramids of Egypt, Journal of the American Ceramic Society 89 (12), 3788- 3796 According to this hypothesis, soft limestone with a high kaolinite content was quarried in the wadi on the south of the Giza Plateau. The limestone was then dissolved in large, Nile-fed pools until it became a watery slurry. Lime (found in the ash of cooking fires) and natron (also used by the Egyptians in mummification) were mixed in. The pools were then left to evaporate, leaving behind a moist, clay-like mixture. This wet \\"concrete\\" would be carried to the construction site where it would be packed into reusable wooden moulds and in a few days would undergo a chemical reaction similar to the curing of concrete. New blocks, he suggests, could be cast in place, on top of and pressed against the old blocks. Proof-of-concept tests using similar compounds were carried out at a geopolymer institute in northern France and it was found that a crew of five to ten, working with simple hand tools, could agglomerate a structure of five, 1.3 to 4.5 ton blocks in a couple of weeks. He also claims that the Famine Stele, along with other hieroglyphic texts, describe the technology of stone agglomeration. Davidovits's method is not accepted by the academic mainstream. His method does not explain the granite stones, weighing well over 10 tons, above the King's Chamber, which he agrees were carved. Geologists have carefully scrutinized Davidovits's suggested technique and concluded his concrete came from natural limestone quarried in the Mokattam Formation.Harrell, James A. and Bret E. Penrod. 1993. \\"The Great Pyramid Debate -- Evidence from the Lauer Sample.\\" Journal of Geological Education, vol. 41:358-363. However, Davidovits alleges that the bulk of the soft limestone came from the same natural Mokkatam Formation quarries found by geologists, and insists that ancient Egyptians used the soft marly layer instead of the hard layer to re-agglomerate stones. Davidovits's hypothesis gained support from Michel Barsoum, a materials science researcher. Michel Barsoum and his colleagues at Drexel University published their findings supporting Davidovits's hypothesis in the Journal of the American Ceramic Society in 2006. Using scanning electron microscopy, they discovered in samples of the limestone pyramid blocks mineral compounds and air bubbles that do not occur in natural limestone.M. W. Barsoum, A. Ganguly, G.

Mike is injured during a football game and sees an alien as part of a hallucination. Mike wonders if football is the right sport for him, but his father, a former football player, insists he stick with the sport. Mike is surprised when Katelyn Sandman, a popular girl at school, requests his help decorating the school for an upcoming Halloween dance party. Mike's foe, Scott Schriebner, who is a player on Mike's football team and a friend of Katelyn, sabotages the light and music equipment during the Halloween party. Mike, upset about the party, leaves and uses a satellite dish to send a message to outer space asking to be rescued. Lightning subsequently destroys the satellite dish. The next day, an alien dog named Barnabus appears, with the ability to speak through a translating device. Barnabus explains that because of Mike, the stargate door has been opened. Barnabus tells Mike that he represents a galactic organization specializing in disaster relief and rights violations, and that he has arrived to answer Mike's plea to be taken off the planet. Barnabus explains that time is limited, as other aliens with ulterior motives are traveling through the stargate to find Mike. Mike, who believes he is hallucinating, later meets The Bom, an alien lawyer insistent on having Mike sue Earth for millions of galactic credits for pain and suffering due to the planet's substandard living conditions. During a telephone conversation with Katelyn, Mike is disgusted by The Bom's way of consuming food, leading Katelyn to believe that Mike is distracted and not listening to her. The Bom angrily leaves after Mike refuses to sue. Mike's friend Nick believes that Mike is going crazy after being told about the aliens. When Barnabus is informed of The Bom's visit, he tells Mike that he opened a can of worms by sending his message, as it signaled to the universe that Earth has advanced to a certain technological level. Because of this, Barnabus says Earth is no longer eligible for intergalactic protection for primitive life. Mike accepts Barnabus' offer to take him to a place where he can be alone, but first tries to make amends with Katelyn. However, the Loafer Alien arrives and prevents Mike from meeting with Katelyn, who believes he has rudely ignored her after insisting that they talk. The alien proposes becoming Mike's agent, representing him throughout the galaxy and eventually having him star in a weekly television show about his life as an immigrant. Mike declines the offer. Nick is stunned when multiple aliens arrive with various offers for Mike. Katelyn visits Mike's house and becomes aware of the aliens.

Nick's young brother Jay unexpectedly arrives and is sucked into the stargate by the Thoad, and taken to the alien's home planet. Barnabus says the Thoad will continue capturing specimens until he finds the perfect one. The children ask Scott to act as bait for the Thoad in order to get through the stargate to the Thoad planet, where the Thoad is safe from intergalactic authorities. Scott is initially skeptical about the children's alien claims, but they convince him that he is the perfect specimen for the job. The stargate opens to pull Scott in, briefly allowing Barnabus and the other children to go through it as well. Barnabus and the three children end up in a cave where the Thoad keeps his zoo of captured species from other planets. Among the specimens is an alien identical to the ones Mike described in his stories, although he is not sure how he could have knowledge of such a creature. The Thoad, in his human form, confronts Barnabus and the children. The Thoad transforms into his frog-like alien form, but is then temporarily contained within a cage. Mike uses the Thoad's key to release the captured specimens, including Scott and Jay. Barnabus and the children return to Earth, but the stargate stays open long enough for the Thoad to follow them. Barnabus contacts the intergalactic police to have the Thoad arrested. At a football game, Barnabus informs Mike that his transmission has been deemed accidental and that Earth is classified again as a protected planet. Though Barnabas offers to take Mike with him, Mike accepts that Earth is his home and says farewell to his friend.

Reception In December 2015, Megan Daley of Entertainment Weekly ranked Can of Worms at number 25 on a list of the top 30 Disney Channel Original Movies. Daley wrote, \\"While Can of Worms isn't as iconic of a PG-fright fest as Halloweentown, it does have a Malcolm McDowell- voiced pup ‚Äî and an alien has never been so friendly and adorable. (Bonus points for a special appearance by a pre-Parenthood Erika Christensen.)\\" In May 2016, Aubrey Page of Collider reviewed each Disney Channel Original Movie released up to that point and placed Can of Worms at number 38. Page praised the film's \\"surprisingly creepy alien creatures\\" and noted the involvement of Paul Schneider, Mark Mothersbaugh and Malcolm McDowell, writing, \\"There's a lot of talent at work here in Can of Worms. [...] But that's not to say this one is good ‚Äì it isn't. In fact, I certainly wouldn't have remembered this one at all if [the film's] wildly creative creatures hadn't kept me awake for a long, sleepless night in 1999.\\" Re-airing Although not shown for many years, the film was broadcast as part of Disney Channel's 2006 \\"Hauntober Fest\\" in October. On October 23, 2007, the film reappeared as part of the Halloween film line-up on the Disney Channel. The film was a part of \\"Wiztober\\" in 2008 and 2009, which is a mix of Halloween films. Also, the film was re-aired on Disney Channel on October 9, 2011 as part of Disney's \\"Monstober\\" event, and on October 6, 2015. The film was also aired in May 2016, as part of Disney Channel's celebration of 100 Disney Channel Original Movies. The film, among other largely unseen DCOMs of the late 90s and early 2000s, was made available on Disney+.

During the 1970s, he served successively as Ambassador to the United States and France. Later, he was President of the National Assembly in 1990. He served in the government as Minister of Justice from 2008 to 2010 and as Minister of Posts and New Information Technologies from 2010 to 2013. A Christian, his base of support is in Tandjil√©, in southern Chad, from which he originates. Early career Alingu√© was born at Fort Lamy in 1937. A largely self-educated man, he started his career by entering the civil service in 1953, where he first served as a clerk in the capital's city treasury. Five years later he had risen to the position of city controller, and, with the independence of Chad from France, he attended the National Treasury School, in Paris between 1960 and 1961. On his return to Chad in 1961 he was made Treasury Inspector and Advisor to the Director of Public Accounts. Alingu√© kept these posts for three years, after which he was promoted, in 1966, to the rank of Treasurer General of Chad, where he remained for ten years. In 1974 he was assigned to the diplomatic service and sent to New York City as ambassador to the United Nations and the United States, and remained there until he was recalled in 1977. He was then Ambassador to France from 1977 to 1979.Bernard Lanne, \\"Chad: Regime Change, Increased Insecurity, and Blockage of Further Reforms\\", Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. Clark and Gardinier, pages 272-274. Following the disintegration of all central authority after the first battle of N'Djamena in 1979, he became secretary-general of the Comit√© Permanente du Sud, the de facto government of southern Chad led by Wadel Abdelkader Kamougu√©. In June 1983, after the Comit√©'s fall in 1982, he formed, with other southerners who had held important posts under the governments of Fran√ßois Tombalbaye and F√©lix Malloum, an opposition party, the Groupe des patriotes et democrates tchadiens. On April 27, 1984, in Lagos, the group signed an accord with the Forces Populares et Revolutionnaires du Tchad, with the goal of forming a third force, opposed to both the Chadian government and the GUNT insurgents. President of the National Assembly and Prime Minister Reconciled with the government, Alingu√© became president of the constitutional commission created by President Hiss√®ne Habr√© on July 8, 1988. The commission was charged with drafting a new constitution, which involved making a national inquiry that included missions and questionnaires. The new constitution was eventually approved by referendum on December 10, 1989. Under this constitution, a parliamentary election was held in July 1990, and Alingu√© was elected to the National Assembly. When the new National Assembly first met on August 5, 1990, it elected Alingu√© as President of the National Assembly. When, on December 1, 1990, Habr√© and much of his government fled the capital before the advancing rebel forces of Idriss D√©by, Alingu√©, as the highest ranking civilian authority left in N'Djamena, appealed for calm on the national radio and announced that he had assumed the lead of an interim government composed of fellow assemblymen and protected by the French troops stationed in the country. He also added that he had already started negotiations with General D√©by and invited the government forces to depose their arms. Alingu√© refused on the occasion to assume the post of Head of State as he was entitled by the constitution in case of vacancy of the presidency, and instead was content to prepare for D√©by's arrival. When later in his political career he was accused of having shown weakness and timidity in taking this course, he answered that if he had taken the office he would have plunged the country into a useless bloodbath.R. Buijtenhuijs, Transition et √©lections au Tchad, pp. 202-203 Talks between Alingu√© and D√©by on the passage of powers began the next day, when D√©by's forces rolled into the capital. On December 6, D√©by, as new leader of Chad, dissolved the National Assembly and formed a new interim government composed of a 33-member Council of State, which included Alingu√© among its members. On March 4, 1991, D√©by was proclaimed President of Chad and he proceeded to dissolve the Council of State the day after. In the new government Alingu√© was given the largely impotent office of Prime Minister, a post he held until May 20, 1992, when he was replaced by Joseph Yodoyman, like him a Chadian Southerner. This dismissal was felt by Alingu√© as an act of political ingratitude, transforming him through time into a staunch opponent of the president. During his period in office, in October 1991, the Council of Ministers adopted recommendations leading to the registration of political parties, thus putting an end to the single-party system. Birth of the UDR While still Prime Minister, he founded one of the first new political parties, the Union for Democracy and Republic (UDR);, of which he was elected president in March 1992, prior to the party's official recognition. the organization was readily considered among Chad's most prominent political parties. Alingu√© united his party with a study group created in April 1991 in Moyen-Chari by a number of young local cadres and intellectuals, among whom was Koibla Djimasta, who became Prime Minister in 1995. This alliance made the UDR a conglomerate of political fiefs, uniting Alingu√©'s personal Tandjil√© base with his allies following in Moyen-Chari. This alliance began breaking up in 1996 on the issue of the approval or not of the proposed constitution. In the ensuing referendum, Djimasta campaigned actively in his region for the \\"yes\\", while Alingu√© became a leading spokesman for the \\"no\\" front. Alingu√© had previously favored a \\"yes\\" vote, but apparently was later forced to side with the \\"no\\" vote by his party that put him in minority in March 1996. This defection was later followed by that of another key Moyen-Chari UDR politician, Abdoulaye Djonouma, marking the breakup of the Moyen-Chari- Tandjil√© coalition and reducing Alingu√©'s UDR to a mere regional party.R. Buijtenhuijs, Transition et √©lections au Tchad, pp. 66, 317-318 Before the referendum, Alingu√© had played a significant role during the convening of the National Sovereign Conference (CNS) in 1993. He acted there as a spokesman for the members representing the political parties, presiding over the conclusive rounds of talks that beginning on March 7 were to define the last issues on the tables. In particular, he played an important role in putting an end to the serious deadlock that emerged regarding the composition and the size of the transitional legislature that was to remain in office until elections were held. After many fruitless votes, Alingu√©, speaking for the political parties, imposed a compromise proposal, on which no negotiation or debate was accepted.R. Buijtenhuijs, La Conf√©rence nationale souveraine du Tchad, p. 170 Elections Under the UDR's banner Alingu√© presented himself on June 2, 1996, as a candidate for the country's first competitive presidential election since independence, coming fourth with 8.31% of the vote. Alingu√©, together with the other 14 opposition candidates, attempted to have the first round of the elections annulled for alleged massive frauds and falsifications favouring President D√©by, but their joint petition to the Court of Appeal was rejected on June 19; Alingu√© then, with other candidates, invited the electors to boycott the second round. His party, the UDR, took part in the 1997 parliamentary election, obtaining four seats.Elections in Chad, African Elections Database. He showed himself, in 1998, to be a staunch advocate for the disengagement of Chadian troops from the Congo War, arguing that, since there was no defensive accord between Chad and Congo-Kinshasa, there was no legal basis for the presence of Chadian troops in Congo.\\"Chad urged to pull out of Congo\\", BBC News, November 13, 1998. He participated in the presidential election held on May 20, 2001, but finished last, receiving only 2.05%, losing 26% in his Tandjil√© stronghold and 14% in N'Djamena compared with 1996.Bamb√©, Naygotimtit (2001); \\"La fin des fiefs √©lectoraux ? \\", Tchad et Culture. With all the opposition candidates he denounced the elections, asking for a rerun. His party, the UDR, boycotted the 2002 parliamentary election, and did the same for the 2005 constitutional referendum. When the results of the latter were published, declared that the results were fixed and accused D√©by of attempting to set up a political dynasty.\\"Chad Referendum Ends Presidential Term Limit Amid Fraud Allegations\\", Voice of America, June 22, 2005. On March 26, 2005, the Public Security and Immigration Minister Abderahmane Moussa withdrew Alingu√©'s passport, claiming that it was not valid, and thus prevented him from leaving Chad to participate in an important gathering of the main opposition leaders in Paris on March 27, 2005. Opposition newspapers argued that the passport was valid, reporting a statement by Alingu√©, who said that he had travelled with the same passport since 2002 without anybody questioning its validity.Mba√Ødedji Ndj√©nodji Fr√©d√©ric (2005); R√©vue de presse tchadienne; \\"Semaine du 26 mars au 03 avril 2005 \\".

Gameplay Barker Bill's Trick Shooting consists of four carnival-type game modes in which the player uses a Zapper to shoot various objects with your Zapper for points. Higher scores are given for more daring shots: those on the verge of disappearing or breaking award the most points. The game modes consist of: *Balloon Saloon ::The player attempts to shoot balloons flying away while avoiding hitting the dog from Duck Hunt. Ballons are worth 100 points each. *Flying Saucers ::Barker Bill and his assistant Trixie will toss plates across the screen. Shoot the plates while avoiding Bill, Trixie, and the parrot. Plates are scored according to how close they are to the floor: from 100 very high up to 500 just above the floor. *Window Pains ::Assorted objects will fall down a screen full of windows, but some of the windows are closed, blocking the player's shots. He can only hit objects through open windows. Hits are scored according to the row the object is hit: from 100 at the top row to 500 on the bottom. *Fun Follies ::This involves progressing through the previous three in turn followed by two additional stages: :* Trixie's Shot (first seen in stage 4) :::Trixie walks around the screen and occasionally presents coins. Shoot the coins while trying not to hit her or the parrot. Points range from 100 to 500 points depending on how quickly they're shot after being presented; any coin she tosses away is always worth 500 points. :::After playing Trixie's Shot, provided at least one diamond was earned, the player will go to a slot machine; pull the trigger to stop the slots. This is the only way to win extra chances in Fun Follies. Diamonds that the player collected in earlier stages (which do not give him extra chances in Fun Follies) allow for more winning lines and a better chance at a big prize. The player is awarded for all winning lines, allowing the potential (with at least two diamonds) for up to 15 extra chances. :* Bill's Thrills (first seen in stage 9) :::Bill will throw objects like eggs and tomatoes high up. They'll be coming down on Trixie. Hit them before they reach Trixie, but be careful of the parrot again. Scoring is higher due to the difficulty and depends on the size of the object thrown: from 800 for the relatively large tomato to 1,500 for the tiny egg. The player will start each game with ten chances. Except during Fun Follies, they can gain a life by shooting a diamond. The player lose one chance for committing each of the following: *Failing to hit a target. *Hitting the wrong thing (such as a person or animal). The game is over when the player runs out of chances. Music The game's soundtrack was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka, the same composer who worked on the music for earlier Nintendo games such as Balloon Fight and Duck Hunt. The high scores music from the VS versions of these games was later remixed by Tanaka himself in Trick Shooting, also playing as a high scores theme. The only difference is that the song is now in the key of C# rather than C, the game uses Tanaka's later sound engine, and there are now digitized drum samples. Reception Allgame gave the game a score of 3.5 stars out of a possible 5. Game Freaks 365 gave it a rating of 83% (the equivalent of a B grade) in their 2005 review.

It was one of the original area codes established in October 1947 and originally covered the entire state of Arizona until 1995, when area code 520 was established as the state's second area code. Arizona's explosive population growth during the second half of the 20th century would have made a split necessary in any event. However, the increased demand for telephone lines created by the proliferation of fax machines, cell phones and dial-up Internet connections brought the state's number pool close to exhaustion by the early 1990s. Many states introduced new area codes during this time frame for much the same reason. Generally, greater Phoenix retained 602, except for some outer portions of Maricopa County that transferred to 520. The creation of 520 was intended as a long-term solution. Within only three years, however, 602 came close to exhaustion once again due to the Valley of the Sun's continued dramatic growth and the continued proliferation of cell phones and pagers. It soon became apparent that the Valley needed multiple area codes. Initially, plans called for an overlay of 602 with another area code. However, overlays were a new concept at the time, and met with some resistance due to the requirement for ten-digit dialing and the fact that overlays make the location of phone numbers ambiguous. As a result, a three-way geographic split was chosen instead. The split became effective on April 1, 1999. The eastern portion, from the Town of Paradise Valley (which goes as far west as 32nd St) as well as the city north of Union Hills and east of the 2000 E Grid, and everything from about 56th Street eastward, became 480. Most of the western portion, including the city west of 39th Ave north of Indian School to west of 63rd Ave from I-10 south, along with the city from north of Union Hills and west of the 2000 E Grid, became 623. Generally, 480 served the East Valley, while 623 served the West Valley. This split resulted in Phoenix becoming one of the few major cities in the nation to be split between multiple area codes. Most of Phoenix remained in 602, but a few areas (such as the Ahwatukee neighborhood and parts of Maryvale) transferred to 480 or 623. The area code divider between 602 and 623 was drawn in such a manner that in some neighborhoods, homes only a few hundred feet away from each other may have different area codes. Only two cities ended with multiple area codes with this change. Glendale's northern half has the 602/623 border running diagonally through its middle. A small portion of Tempe (west and south of the I-10 Broadway Curve) also remained in 602, with most of the city moving to 480. Even with Phoenix's continued growth, 602 is one of the few urbanized area codes without an overlay, making Phoenix one of the few major cities where seven-digit dialing would still be possible. Under current projections, it will stay that way until at least late 2028.https://nationalnanpa.com/reports/2020-1_NPA_Exhaust_Projections_Final.pdf Despite this, ten-digit dialing is required in some portions of the Valley. The three Valley area codes form one of the largest local calling areas in the western United States. With few exceptions, no long distance charges are applied from one portion of the Valley to another. Even after the split into three area codes, most of the Valley is still part of the Phoenix exchange, making Phoenix one of the largest rate centers in the United States.Local calling guide: Phoenix, AZ References  External links  602 602 Phoenix, Arizona Telecommunications-related introductions in 1947 ","title":"Area code 602"},{"id":"4041524","text":"Nassour Guelendouksia Ouaido (born 1947) is a Chadian politician who was Prime Minister of Chad from 1997 to 1999 and was President of the National Assembly of Chad from 2002 to 2011.

Sitia lies five kilometers to the west. Archaeology The building at Hagia Photia has 37 rooms that open onto a central court, but which do not necessarily connect to adjoining rooms. It was originally built in the Middle Minoan period with a surrounding fortification wall. The fortifications are important to note, as so few Minoan settlements have evidence of city walls. Other fortified Minoan settlements are from the Pre-Palatial period, but Hagia Photia is of the Old Palatial period. Three apsidal buttresses along the north wall (which faces the sea) and a fourth at the southwest corner of the outer wall are similar to the buttresses on fortification walls at Lerna in the Argolid subregion and Chalandriani cemetery on the Island of Syros. The site was abandoned, and circular structures were built over its ruins. The structures might be tholos tombs, and they would be the most northerly and most easterly tombs of their kind on the island. Many of the grave goods here are Cycladic, and they may indicate that Hagia Photia was a Cycladic colony. Two Kouphota hill caves (which face the sea) contain Neolithic, Pre-Palatial, and Old Palance period remnants. 150 meters to the east, a Minoan cemetery, Glyphada, has been excavated with over 250 Minoan chamber tombs. Finds excavated from Hagia Photia are at the Archaeological Museum of Sitia and the Agios Nikolaos, Crete, Museum.

It was created on April 1, 1999, in a three-way split of area code 602, when it was apparent that the Valley of the Sun was growing too fast for it to remain entirely in one area code. Generally, 480 is coextensive with the East Valley, while most of the West Valley is area code 623 and most of Phoenix itself remained in 602. By the turn of the millennium, 602 was running out of numbers just four years after all of the state outside of the Valley of the Sun was split off as area code 520. Original plans called for 480 to be an overlay code for the entire Phoenix metro area. However, overlays were a new concept at the time, and met with considerable resistance due to potential geographic ambiguity, as well as the requirement for ten-digit dialing. A three-way geographic split was chosen instead, with 480 assigned to the East Valley. The 480 area code encompasses Scottsdale, Paradise Valley, Fountain Hills, Tempe (except for a small portion west and south of the I-10 Broadway Curve, which stayed in 602), Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Queen Creek, Apache Junction, as well as far northeast Phoenix and the Phoenix neighborhood of Ahwatukee, and newer unincorporated communities in far northwest Pinal County that are becoming part of the Greater Phoenix metropolitan area due to heavy development. Also in area code 480 are pagers for the Iridium satellite telephone service. As of April 2020, area code 480 is expected to reach exhaustion by the third quarter of 2024. The three Valley area codes form one of the largest local calling areas in the western United States. With few exceptions, no long distance charges are applied from one portion of the Valley to another. Even after the split into three area codes, most of the Valley is still part of the Phoenix exchange, making Phoenix one of the largest rate centers in the United States.Local calling guide: Phoenix, AZ See also References 480 Phoenix metropolitan area 480 ","title":"Area code 480"},{"id":"4041573","text":"Wormian bones, also known as intrasutural bones or sutural bones, are extra bone pieces that can occur within a suture (joint) in the skull.

They occur most frequently in the course of the lambdoid suture, which is more tortuous than other sutures. They are also occasionally seen within the sagittal and coronal sutures. A large wormian bone at lambda is often called an Inca bone (Os Incae), due to the relatively high frequency of occurrence in Peruvian mummies. Another specific Wormian bone, the pterion ossicle, sometimes exists between the sphenoidal angle of the parietal bone and the great wing of the sphenoid bone. They tend to vary in size and can be found on either side of the skull. Usually, not more than several are found in a single individual, but more than one hundred have been once found in the skull of a hydrocephalic adult.

The company's main customer was then the Soviet Union Department of Defense, providing them with wristwatches, pocket watches and table clocks. Unique clocks were also produced specifically for use in Soviet tanks, fighter aircraft, submarines and, eventually, spacecraft. Molnija's main product were mechanical pocket watches with military, religious and historical motifs. The Molnija movement is basically a copy of a Cort√©bert movement used in Swiss watches from around 1940. About 80% of the work on most of the watches was done by hand. Some Molnija movements were used in oversized men's wristwatches. Early Molnija pocket watch movements (from 1947 to c. 1960) normally had 15 jewels. Later ones (from around 1965 to 1997) normally had 18 jewels. However from around 1997 they started to produce lower quality watches with fewer jewels.

He was one of the signers of the Mayflower Compact.  Early life and family origin  It is known that George came on the Mayflower and was credited to the household of Edward Winslow as a manservant or apprentice, along with Elias Story and a little girl Ellen More, who both died in the first winter.Caleb H.

Following up on research published by Louise Walsh Throop in 2009, the DNA study pointed to Soule's parents as Jan Sol and his wife Mayken Labis, who are identified by their marriage as Protestant refugees in London, England, in 1586 and by the baptisms of their children before 1600 in Haarlem, Holland.Soule Kindred Newsletter, Vol.43 No.4, Autumn 2009, pg 10 https://soulekindred.org/resources/Documents/Newsletters/PDF- Newsletters/Vol.-43-No.-4-Autumn-2009.pdf Their eldest known son Johannes Sol is identified by his baptism in 1591, as well as by his permissions in both Haarlem and Leyden to marry in Leyden. Johannes Sol, a printer in Leyden with one known publication, died suddenly, probably while helping William Brewster in the presswork for the Perth Assembly. His apprentice, Edward Raban, apparently fled to Scotland in 1619 in order to avoid being apprehended by agents of the King of England. It appears he was accompanied by the pregnant widow of his master and probably took with him the missing press of Brewster, as well as the telltale type and initials from Brewster; Raban also apparently took with him the Sol press and type. Edward Raban in 1622 published a very veiled version of his master's shocking death, well hidden in a discussion of drunkenness and resultant whoredom.\\"Record of the Celebration of the Tercentenary of the Introduction of the Art of Printing into Aberdeen by Edward Raban in the Year 1622\\" (Aberdeen, Scotland: The Master Printers' Guild, 1922) p. 42 It would appear all helpers in the press work and distribution of \\"Perth Assembly\\" took an oath of silence that was never breached, even after King James I died in 1625.Louise Walsh Throop, \\"William Brewster's Subterfuge\\" Mayflower Descendant Volume 66, Number 1 (Winter 2018) pp. 14‚Äì22 Some researchers have pointed to circumstantial evidence that George Soule's family may have had Sephardic (Converso) Jewish roots, due to \\"Sol/Soule\\" being a common Sephardic nameJudith K.

This Jan van Sol was a zealous opponent of Anabaptism, which he saw in 1550 as divided into three movements: the Melchiorites (the peaceful Mennonite group), the Davidites, and the Batenburgers.A L E Verheyden, \\"Anabaptism in Flanders 1530‚Äì1650\\" (1946, reprinted 1961) p. 31 Jan van Sol was born at Dordrecht, in South Holland, but left the Netherlands in 1530 because of debts (he kept an inn there) and went east to Danzig. There he was known as Johann/Jan Solius (the Latin version of his name). In 1536 he bought the \\"Robitten\\" estate near Bardeyn in East Prussia. He returned in 1550 to Brussels but may have spent his last years, until about 1556, in the territory of Preussisch-Holland. A presumed son born about 1525, and by naming patterns was probably named Georg, would have married about 1555 perhaps in Brussels, and thus would have been the father of Jan Sol of the 1586 marriage record in London. This Jan Sol and wife Maecken had seven children baptized in the Dutch Reformed Church of Haarlem in 1590‚Äì99.Louise Walsh Throop, \\"Further Searching for the Origins of Mayflower Passenger George Soule: Printer's Devil in Leiden?\\" Soule Kindred Newsletter Volume 43 No. 4 p. 10 (Autumn 2009)  Mayflower  Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris 1899 The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on 6/16 September 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30‚Äì40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with the caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. These conditions, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, contributed to the high number of fatalities in the first winter, especially for the women and children. On the voyage, there were two deaths, being just a crew member and a passenger. The worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton. Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On 9/19 November 1620, after about 2 months at sea, preceded by a month of delays in and around England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on 11/21 November. On 11 November 1620, Soule and others signed the Mayflower Compact. Soule and three others were under 21 years of age, and one of the three had a baptismal record showing he was just 20 years old at the time of signing. It appears the signers were members of a church group, where the age of membership was 18. The original compact was lost. It was published, without any signers' names appended, several times after 1620. It was not until almost 50 years after the signing that the Compact was published with the names of the signers. Thus the print work crew of Brewster, Winslow, Soule and others was sheltered from exposure to the agents of King James I of England. When finally published with all names of signers, only Soule was still alive from the print work crew.  In Plymouth Colony  Soule first lived with Edward Winslow whose first house in Plymouth was located on the site of what is now the 1749 Court House Museum on Town Square in downtown Plymouth.Craig S. Chartier, \\"Of Plymouth Plantation: Predicting the Location of the Original Plymouth Village, Its Extent, and Its Houses,\\" PARP May 2016, www.plymoutharch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/leyden-st-houses.pdf After moving to Duxbury, George Soule acquired land at Powder Point In 1623, the Division of Land at Plymouth provided one acre for George Soule between the property of \\"Frances\\" Cooke and \\"Mr. Isaak\\" Allerton.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 415 About 1626, George Soule married a woman by the name of Mary. It is known that the only Mary in Plymouth who was then unmarried was Mary Bucket (Buckett). In 1623, \\"Marie\\" Buckett, as a single woman, had received one acre of land.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 355, 417 In 1626 George Soule was one of twenty-seven Purchasers involved with the colony joint-stock company which afterwards was turned over to the control of senior colony members. That group was called Undertakers, and were made up of such Pilgrim leaders as Bradford, Standish and Allerton initially, who were later joined by other leaders Winslow, Brewster, Howland, Alden, Prence and others from London who were former Merchant Adventurers. On the agreement, dated 26 October 1626, his name appears as \\"Georg Soule.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 27, 28, 36, 419‚Äì420 In the 1627 Division of Cattle, George and Mary Soule and their first son Zachariah (all with the recorded surname of \\"Sowle\\") were listed with the Richard Warren family. They were allotted several animals that arrived on the ship Jacob, probably in 1625.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 424 Historic records indicate Soule became a freeman prior to 1632/33 (Johnson) or was on the 1633 list of freemen. In 1633/34 Soule (as \\"Sowle\\") was taxed at the lowest rate which indicates that his estate was without much significance.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 427, 429 Per Plymouth records, Soule's life with his family appears to have been lived quietly in a Puritan home ‚Äì obtaining some land holdings through the years which he would later provide for his large family. He was never involved in any criminal or civil court dispute and did participate in a number of public service situations, one being his volunteering to fight in the Pequot War in 1637, which was over before the Plymouth company could get organized.Caleb H. Johnson. The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), p. 206 Land records note that in 1637 he was assigned \\"a garden place‚Ä¶on Duxbury side, by Samuel Nash's, to lie to his ground at Powder Point\\". The 1638 land records note that \\"one acre of land is granted to George Soule at the watering place‚Ä¶and also a parcel of Stony Marsh at Powder Point, containing two acres.\\" The land at the \\"watering place\\" in south Plymouth was sold the next year, possibly as he was living in Duxbury at that time and did not need his property in south Plymouth. In 1640 he was granted a meadow at Green's Harbor ‚Äì now Marshfield. His land holdings included property in several towns, those being Namaskett, Middleboro and Dartmouth. First in 1642 and last in 1662, he was assigned to at least five grand and petty juries. He was deputy for Duxbury for several years. In the 1643 Able to Bear Arms (ATBA) List, George and his son Zachariah (listed as \\"Georg\\" and \\"Zachary\\") appear with those bearing arms from Duxbury (written as \\"Duxbarrow\\").Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 441 In October 1645 the General Court granted to Duxbury inhabitants lands \\"about Saughtuckquett\\" and nominated \\"Captaine Miles Standish, Mr John Alden, George Soul‚Ä¶\\" and others for \\"equall devideing and laying forth of the said lands to their inhabitants.\\" The purpose of this committee was to divide property in the Duxbury area for its inhabitants. Soule was also on a similar committee in 1640.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 79 On 20 October 1646 Soule, with Anthony Thatcher, was chosen to be on a \\"committee to draw up an order concerning disorderly drinking (smoking) of tobacco.\\" The law, as drawn up, provided strict limitations on where tobacco could be smoked and what fines could be levied against lawbreakers.  Family  Marie/Mary Buckett, wife of George Soule. The young woman known to Plymouth Colony history as \\"Marie Buckett\\" arrived in Plymouth in July 1623 as a single woman passenger on the ship Anne. She may have been about age 18 (born c. 1604) and appears to have traveled with some Alden relatives of her mother, or with members of the possible Warren family with whom she may have lived after the death of her father. Earlier researchers have been stymied in their efforts to prove her ancestry, or from where she came, whether Holland or England.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 417 She first appears in Plymouth Colony records in the 1627 Division of Cattle with passengers of the Anne as \\"Marie Buckett\\" where she received one lot of her own \\"adioyning to Joseph Rogers\\" ..\\"on the other side of towne towards the eele-riuer.\\" Author Caleb Johnson estimates she married George Soule about 1625 or 1626.The Mayflower Quarterly, Research into the Possible English Origins of Mary Buckett Wife of Mayflower Passenger George Soule, December 2013,(Plymouth, MA.: The General Society of Mayflower Descendants), by Caleb Johnson, vol. 79, no. 4, pp. 313, 314 As George Soule was probably born in 1601, and he would have had to wait to marry until released as Winslow's servant at age 25, the marriage of George and Mary was probably in 1626. In the 1627 Division of Cattle she is listed with her husband George and young son \\"Zakariah\\" as \\" Mary Sowle.\\" Noted Mayflower researcher and author Caleb H. Johnson writes in The Mayflower Quarterly of December 2013 that the origin of Mary Buckett, wife of Mayflower passenger George Soule, has not been conclusively proven by his, or any previous research. What Johnson did find in England, through extensive research and a lengthy process of elimination was a Mary Beckett in the parish of Watford, Hertfordshire. This Mary was born about 1605 and fits the right age to have been on the Anne in 1623. Also she was in a family using the name Nathaniel, which is found in her own children. Her mother had a Mayflower-sounding name ‚Äì Alden. She and her husband George were grouped with the Warrens in the 1627 Division of Cattle, with Mrs. Warren coming from Hertfordshire, as did Mary Beckett. Mary's home parish register of St. Mary's Church, Watford, has a number of sixteenth-century Warren family entries of names which all appear in the Mayflower Warren family. Johnson considers the following to be among the most important information in considering Marie Buckett's ancestry ‚Äì Mary Beckett's father died in 1619 when she was only about 14 years old. As a custom of the time, she and her siblings were likely apprenticed out to relatives, neighbors, acquaintances, etc. Her mother remained a widow until at least 1622 (listed in that year as \\"Widow Buckett\\") ‚Äì further increasing the chance that her children would be sent to other families. Johnson concludes by stating that the following could have put Mary Beckett hypothetically on the ship Anne sailing to America in 1623: the right age, associated with families of Mayflower surnames, within a family using the name Nathaniel, and could have had the opportunity to be transferred to another family that would eventually sail to America on the ship Anne. Johnson notes after this time, Mary Beckett is not found again in Watford records, based on recent research.The Mayflower Quarterly, Research into the Possible English Origins of Mary Buckett Wife of Mayflower Passenger George Soule, by Caleb Johnson, December 2013, (Plymouth, MA.: The General Society of Mayflower Descendants), vol. 79, no. 4, pp. 313‚Äì324 Children of George and Mary Soule: * Zachariah was born by May 1627 and died in Duxbury before 11 December 1663. He married Margaret Ford by 1663, but had no recorded children. * John was born about 1632 and died in Duxbury before 14 November 1707. He married: :1. Rebecca Simmons about 1656 and had nine children. She died between 1675 and 1678. :2. Esther (Delano) Samson about 1678 and had three children. She died in Duxbury on 12 September 1735. * Nathaniel was born between 1634 and 1646 and died in Dartmouth before 12 October 1699. He married Rose Thorn by 1680 and had five children. Nathaniel may have caused the most colony trouble of any of his siblings. On 5 March 1667/8, he made an appearance in Plymouth court to \\"answer for his abusing of Mr. John Holmes, teacher of the church of Christ at Duxbury, by many false, scandalous and opprobrious speeches.\\" He was sentenced to make a public apology for his actions, find sureties for future good behavior and to sit in the stocks, with the stock sentence remitted. His father George and brother John had to pay surety for Nathaniel's good behavior with he being bound for monies and to pay a fine. Three years later, on 5 June 1671, he was fined for \\"telling several lies which tended greatly to the hurt of the Colony in reference to some particulars about the Indians.\\" And then on 1 March 1674/5 he was sentenced to be whipped for \\"lying with an Indian woman,\\" and had to pay a fine in the form of bushels of corn to the Indian woman towards the keeping of her child.Caleb H. Johnson. The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), p. 207 * George was born about 1639 and died in Dartmouth before 22 June 1704. He married by 1671 Deborah Thomas :Elizabeth, like her brother Nathaniel, also had her share of problems with the Plymouth Court. On 3 March 1662/3, the Court fined Elizabeth and Nathaniel Church for committing fornication. Elizabeth then in turn sued Nathaniel Church \\"for committing an act of fornication with her... and then denying to marry her.\\" The jury awarded her damages plus court costs.Caleb H. Johnson. The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), pp. 207‚Äì208 :On 2 July 1667 Elizabeth was sentenced to be whipped at the post \\"for committing fornication the second time.\\" And although the man with whom she committed the act was not named, Elizabeth did marry Francis Walker within the following year.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), p. 208 * Patience was born about 1646 and died on 11 March 1705/6 in Middleboro. She married John Haskell in January 1666/7 in Middleboro and had eight children. He died on 15 May 1706 in Middleboro. * Benjamin was born by about 1652 and died unmarried during King Philip's War on 26 March 1676. Although George Soule became wealthy in Plymouth colony he still bound out at least one of his daughters to a John Winslow.John Demos, Notes on Life in Plymouth Colony The William and Mary Quarterly, Third Series, Vol. 22, No. 2, Apr., 1965, p. 284 George Soule's gravestone in Duxbury within the Myles Standish Burial Ground.  Will, death and burial  George Soule made his will on 11 August 1677 and mentions his eldest son John \\"my eldest son John Soule and his family hath in my extreme old age and weakness been tender and careful of me and very helpful to me.\\" John was his executor and to whom was given nearly all of Soule's estate. But after he wrote his will, on 12 September 1677 George seemed to have second thoughts and made a codicil to the will to the effect that if John or any family member were to trouble his daughter Patience or her heirs, the will would be void. And if such happened, Patience would then become the executor of his last will and testament with virtually all that he owned becoming hers. To put his youngest daughter to inherit his estate ahead of his eldest son would have been a major humiliation for John Soule. But John must have done well in his father's eyes since after his father's death, he did inherit the Duxbury estate. Twenty years later Patience and her husband sold the Middleboro estate they had received from her father. George Soule's will was dated 11 August 1677, with a codicil dated 20 September 1677 and with the will proved in 1679. His will named his sons Nathaniel, George and John, and daughters Elizabeth, Patience, Susannah and Mary. His sons Zachariah and Benjamin had predeceased him. George Soule died shortly before 22 January 1679, when inventory was taken of his estate. He was buried at Myles Standish Burial Ground in Duxbury, Massachusetts as his wife Mary had predeceased him in 1676. Per Stratton, the Soule family history compiled by Gideon T. Ridlon is not reliable. Researcher and author Louise Walsh Throop considers Ridlon occasionally reliable, as the second volume was printed in haste. Records received by correspondence are usually reliable, but Ridlon's assigned lineages and interpretations of relationships are not always reliable.

It was also released in Japan on December 23 of the same year, where it was instead distributed by Mumin Corporation. One of the first games written for the platform, it was one of the launch titles that were released along with the system in North America. In the game, the eponymous evil spider has trapped the player's space fighter in his web of universes, which are interconnected by a series of teleportation gates and riddled with alien bases, with the primary objective of finding and defeating him while recruiting friendly allies along the way. Programmed by Todd's Adventures in Slime World author Peter Engelbrite, Gates of Zendocon began its development prior to the existence of functional Lynx hardware. Gates of Zendocon received positive reception from critics after its initial release, with praise towards the presentation, originality and gameplay but the sound department received criticism. An updated conversion for the Atari Jaguar was planned but never went into full production due to a lack of internal interest.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Gates of Zendocon is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up game where the player take control of an unnamed space fighter craft across 51 non-linear levels (\\"universes\\"), with the main objective being finding and defeating the evil spider Zendocon by passing through teleportation gates to do so, while battling against an assortment of Zendocon's army.Gates of Zendocon game manual (Atari Lynx, US) During gameplay, there are a number of friendly alien allies who were slaved by Zendocon that aid the player in their journey and protect the ship. Most of the levels are riddled with enemies and if the player's ship is hit by an enemy or projectile, it will reflect the amount of damage taken as a result: it can lose the laser tip and the engine before the last hit that will obliterate the player's ship. In addition, there is a hidden level inside the game where the player can earn high scores by destroying the faces of the game's creators.  Development and release  Gates of Zendocon started its development before any Atari Lynx hardware existed. Gates of Zendocon was written by Peter Engelbrite when he worked at Epyx as games developer and programmer. He also worked on Atari 2600 conversion of other titles from the company such as California Games, Summer Games and Winter Games. In an online interview with website The Atari Times, Engelbrite recounted about the development process of the game, stating that work on the project began before functional Atari Lynx hardware existed and wrote an emulator of the console on the Apple II 8-bit microcomputer, setting up the system's graphical data structures but displaying the sprites as ASCII text. Later during development, an early revision of the Lynx capable of displaying raster graphics was made, with the game running for the first time on actual hardware, albeit at a slow frame rate. Atari composer Alex Rudis was also involved during the production of the project, recalling the process of the developer's pictures in the hidden level on another interview with The Atari Times, which involved using a video camera to scan the image with Dave Needle and other team members freezing the images in order to be clear, while Rudis rotated his portrait as the scanning occurred to make it look distorted. Electronic Gaming Monthly also revealed that other members involved in its production, among them being Lynx co-inventor R. J. Mical, although their roles were not specified. Gates of Zendocon was one of the original launch titles during the initial release of the Lynx in 1989 along with the aforementioned California Games, Blue Lightning and Electrocop. It was also released in Europe around the same time period and later in Japan on December 23 of the same year, where it was distributed by Mumin Corporation instead and the difference between the international and Japanese releases is that the latter came bundled with an instruction manual in Japanese. The game was first showcased to the public during the International Summer Consumer Electronics Show 1989, along with the system.  Reception  Gates of Zendocon garnered positive reception. In a review for STart, Clayton Walnum called the game \\"the obligatory, horizontally-scrolling, outer-space shoot-em-up\\", and said it would only appeal to fans of the genre due to its limited depth and weak use of the Lynx hardware. Robert A. Jung also reviewed the game which was published to IGN. He noted that \\"Underneath the average graphics and average sound is a well-rounded, pretty diverse action game\\" and called it \\"a good buy\\". Giving a final score of 7 out of 10.  Legacy  In 1993, Atari Corp. requested several Epyx titles in order to be converted and release to the then-upcoming Atari Jaguar, with Gates of Zendocon among the list of selected titles. After the initial discontinuation of Protector on Jaguar in 1995, Atari suggested to use its engine in a proposed update of Gates of Zendocon for the system but Christopher Weaver, then-president of Bethesda Softworks, was not interested and no actual development started on this version due to this decision.

Janson is a crisp, relatively high-contrast serif design, most popular for body text. Janson is based on surviving matrices from Leipzig that were named for Anton Janson (1620‚Äì1687), a Leipzig-based printer and punch-cutter from the Netherlands who was believed to have created them. In 1954 Harry Carter and George Buday published an essay proving that the designer of the Janson typeface was in fact a Hungarian-Transylvanian schoolmaster and punchcutter, Mikl√≥s (Nicholas) T√≥tfalusi Kis (1650‚Äì1702). Historical background Roman types from the Ehrhardt specimen. The larger sizes are more condensed than the smaller ones on which Ehrhardt and Janson are based. Italic types from the Ehrhardt specimen Mikl√≥s Kis, a Transylvanian Protestant pastor and schoolmaster, became deeply interested in printing after being sent to Amsterdam to help print a Hungarian Protestant translation of the Bible. This was a period of considerable prosperity for the Netherlands and a time when its styles of printing were very influential across Europe, making it a centre for the creation of new typefaces. He developed a second career as a punchcutter, an engraver of the punches used as a master for stamping matrices for casting metal type, selling his work to printers in the Netherlands and abroad. The style he worked in was based on French serif typefaces of the previous century, but with boosted x-height and higher stroke contrast, creating a higher-contrast, sharper effect. It was later called the \\"Dutch taste\\" (go√ªt hollandois), a term originating from the writings of Pierre Simon Fournier in the next century. Kis is considered to have been one of the most talented engravers active during this period, and perhaps uniquely wrote about his work in later life, allowing greater insight into his work than other earlier engravers. Kis also cut typefaces for other languages including Greek and Hebrew typefaces. Kis returned to Transylvania around 1689 and may have left matrices (the moulds used to cast type) in Leipzig on his way home. The Ehrhardt type foundry of Leipzig released a surviving specimen sheet of them around 1720, leading to the attribution to Janson. Kis's surviving matrices were first acquired by Stempel, and are now held in the collection of the Druckmuseum (Museum of Printing), Darmstadt. Kis's identity as the maker of the typefaces was rediscovered in the 1950s by comparison with type from Hungarian archive sources (including his autobiography) on which his name was identified. Due to their survival, the Janson typefaces became with fine printers of the late Arts and Crafts period such as Updike, who could print books from them using hand-set type cast from surviving original matrices. In his book Printing Types: Their History, Forms and Uses, Updike commented that \\"although heavy, they retain considerable vivacity of line and have great capabilities when used with taste.\\" Despite its 17th-century origins, Janson is used in a wide variety of modern-day text applications. As of the magazine's 2011 redesign, Architectural Digest uses Janson for body text in all of its articles; so does Philosophy Now. It has also been used for the Journal of the British Printing Historical Society. Revivals A book printed by Kis in Kolozsv√°r (modern name Cluj-Napoca) in 1697, after his return to Transylvania. It defends his somewhat contentious choices of editing and orthography in his Hungarian printing. The Janson type was popular with twentieth-century typographers including Updike and Stanley Morison, who admired its design as something different to the Didone and neo-medieval types dominant in the nineteenth century, and several revivals were made in the twentieth century for the hot metal typesetting systems of the period. A revival of the face was designed in 1937 by Chauncey H. Griffith of the Mergenthaler Linotype foundry. The revival was taken from the original matrices, held since 1919 by the Stempel Type Foundry, which were Mergenthaler's exclusive agent in Europe. Griffith was a great admirer of the Janson designs, writing to Carl Rollins of Yale University Press that \\"I am so anxious to have the Linotype face worthy of its name. If I cannot succeed in satisfying myself that our interpretation of Janson will be worthy of the honored name it bears, we shall not hesitate a moment to scrap the whole work and forget it.\\" The most common digital version, Janson Text, comes from a metal version produced by Hermann Zapf in the 1950s at Stempel. This was based on Kis' original matrices.Jaspert, Pincus, Berry, and Johnson, p. 122. Digitisations are available from Linotype, Adobe, Bitstream (adding Cyrillic glyphs), URW++ (adding an additional light and black weights) and others. A separate digital version is Elsner+Flake's Kis Antiqua Now. Described by Paul Shaw as the best digital version, it was designed by Hildegard Korger and Erhard Kaiser and originates from Korger's revival for the East German foundry VEB Typoart. A separate common revival of the Janson types is Ehrhardt, created by Monotype in the 1930s. Somewhat more condensed than most Janson revivals, giving it a crisp, vertical appearance, it is a popular book typeface, particularly often used in the UK. Besides a number of revivals specifically of Ehrhardt (described in that article), two more by Linotype and Berthold have been sold under the name of Kis.

Plot In 12th-century China, during Mongol rule, childhood sweethearts Jinha and Sullie are separated but vow to reunite. Orphan Jinha begins training in the Bichun martial arts and discovers his father was a swordsman murdered by the Mongol army. Meanwhile, Sullie's father, a Mongol general, arranges for her to marry a Mongol noble. Believing Jinha to be dead, Sullie marries the noble. Recovering from near-death, Jinha takes on the persona of bandit Jahalang, and begins an anti-Mongol crusade with the help of his army of warriors.

This huge pine forest stretches for 3000 km across the lower elevations of the great Himalaya range for almost its entire length including parts of Pakistan's Punjab Province in the west through Azad Kashmir, the northern Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Sikkim, Nepal and Bhutan, which is the eastern extent of the pine forest. Like so many Himalayan ecosystems the pine forests are split by the deep Kali Gandaki Gorge in Nepal, to the west of which the forest is slightly drier while it is wetter and thicker to the east where the monsoon rains coming off the Bay of Bengal bring more moisture. Along the stretch of the ganja hills of himachal can be seen rare varieties of leopard and tiger pine trees ( Pinus felicis) characterized by their spotted and patterned bark Flora The predominant flora of the ecoregion is a thin woodland of drought-resistant Pinus roxburghii trees with a ground cover of thick grass, as regular fires do not allow a shrubby undergrowth to establish itself. The ground cover consists of Arundinella setosa, cogon grass (Imperata cylindrica) and Themeda anathera. Pine forest mainly grows on south-facing slopes although in western Nepal there are areas facing in other directions. Some of the larger areas can be found in the lower elevations of Kangra and Una Districts of Himachal Pradesh and in Bhutan. It occurs in smaller patches in eastern Himachal Pradesh and lower Uttarakhand, in the more thinly populated western Nepal, and on the lower elevations (between 1,000 and 2,000m) of the Sivalik and Himachal ranges. Fauna Although there is not a rich variety of wildlife here when compared to tropical rainforest for example the region is important habitat, especially for birds. Wildlife includes tigers and leopards although in smaller numbers than in the lowland areas where herds of grazing antelopes provide food for them, whereas these slopes do not sustain grazing in large numbers. More typical animals of the pine forest are langurs and other animals of the Himalayas. Birds include the chestnut-breasted partridge and cheer pheasants that hide in the lush grass. Conservation These habitats are vulnerable to logging for firewood or conversion to grazing or farmland and more than half the area has been cleared or degraded which then allows the mountain water to wash away the soil quickly. The most profound changes can be seen in central and eastern Nepal, where the forest has been cleared for terrace farming. The protected areas of pine forest are small but include part of the larger Jim Corbett National Park.

The original beater was an actual horseshoe, a shape which is still retained in the dhantal's modern context as a musical instrument. Its top may be blunt or tapered to a fine point to allow for greater resonance, and its end is shaped into a circle that rests on the ground, table, or other surface when it is played. It is usually about a meter long and 3/8\\" to 1/2\\" thick. History The dhantal (also called the dhandataal) is of Indian origin, but most commonly found in the Caribbean and Fiji. The instrument was brought to the Caribbean and to the Fiji Islands by indentured laborers from India. The instrument's name literally means \\"stick percussion\\" from danda, \\"stick,\\" and taal, the act of striking rhythmically. Technique The dhantal is played by striking a metal rod (usually iron or steel) with a metal beater shaped like a horseshoe. The amount of resonance is controlled by opening and closing the hand that is holding the rod. The dhantal's timbre is sharply metallic and provides a clearly defined tal (beat or pulse) to help the ensemble stay in rhythmic sync. The basic rhythm of the dhantal is an ostinato consisting of two sixteenth-notes followed by an eighth-note. This rhythm has a similar \\"feel\\" to the merengue music of the Dominican Republic, which itself was based on an African rhythm brought to the Caribbean through the Afro- Caribbean diaspora.

It is a mixture of two Family Computer video games in the Hiry≈´ no Ken franchise: Hiryu no Ken II: Dragon no Tsubasa and Hiryu no Ken III: 5 Nin no Ryuu Senshi. It implements ideas and elements from both games. The first installment of the Hiry≈´ no Ken series had already been released in North America as Flying Dragon: The Secret Scroll, with virtually no modification aside from the language. Gameplay The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells. Plot A long time ago, Demonyx of the Dark Dimension attempted to invade the Light Dimension. After a long battle, the hero of the Light Dimension, Dragonlord, sealed Demonyx up by the power of the Mandara Talisman, at which time Demonyx prophesied that he would be back upon the appearance of the Red Evil Star. Years later, an ominous red star appeared in the sky. Just then, five shooting lights came down toward the ground. Rick Stalker was brought up by Kung Fu master Gen Lao-Tsu, and is alone in the mountains as usual brushing up on his Kung Fu skills when he comes upon a weeping angel missing her robe. He explores the mountain's caves and ends up encountering a gargoyle who is really a Tusk Soldier in disguise guarding the robe, which is embedded in a rock. Upon the return of her robe, the angel shows Rick a secret passage down the ravine, where he finds a mysterious orb. Rick goes back to tell Gen the whole story. Gen apprises him that this orb is the Orb of Courage, and that Rick should cross the ocean to Gen's mother land China, where his fate is waiting for him. Rick goes to China and enters the Shorin temple, the head temple of Kung-Fu, where he spars with Fusetsu, Ensetsu, and Rakan in three separate chambers. When Ensetsu is defeated by Rick, he gives him the Mirror of Mercury, stating that Rick may be the fighter for whom they have been waiting. In the final chamber, Rakan tells Rick that the Orb of Courage is part of the Mandara Talisman, which was used to seal up Demonyx a long time ago, and that Rick will have to locate all the broken pieces of the Talisman to seal him up again. While sparring with Rick, Rakan teaches him how to awaken his true power and transform into a Flying Warrior capable of utilizing sacred mirrors to block mystic spells and arcane swords to cast them. Upon defeating Rakan, Rick obtains the Sword of Vijaya. The line to GTG's biological weapon research laboratory in Peru was disconnected when the office was covered with a mysterious black fog, which Rakan believes must have something to do with the Dark Dimension. Rakan exhorts Rick to enter in the tournament in Hong Kong that the president of GTG has decided to hold with the intent of deciding on the investigation party. Wandering around in Hong Kong, Rick learns that there is a phantom blocking the entrance to the coliseum who can only be banished with the help of a bracelet that can be bought at Shunran's store for coin that can be obtained by fighting Jiangshi and fire-raining ghouls. But after Rick pays Shunran, she admits to not having it and instead tells him the password that will convince a certain dragon statue to grant it to an honest man. Rick ventures beyond the waterfall in search of the stone dragon, and finds it in a cave inhabited by a gargoyle who is really a Tusk Soldier in disguise guarding the Sword of Kirik. The dragon grants Rick the bracelet, and tells him that he will obtain the Orb of Wisdom from the phantom when he defeats him. Rick goes back and ventures through another cave guarded by a gargoyle who turns is really a Tusk Soldier in disguise and finds and defeats the phantom, gets the Orb, and enters the tournament. He fights Litron the martial artist, Thornram the kickboxer, Shiro the karate fighter, The Mad Ape the wrestler, and Slugger Sam the boxer. Shiro and Slugger Sam are in fact Tusk soldiers, each guarding a dragma. Rick, Mary Lynn, and Hayato Go are declared the winners of the tournament, and thus the members of the investigation party. Once the triad is in airspace over Peru, one of Rick's orbs begins to flash, informing him that his traveling companions are Flying Warriors too. He places the Sword of Vijaya on their foreheads, then the three transform and jump out the plane. They fight their way to the jungle village, where they stumble upon the sole survivor of the first investigation party, Greg Cummings, who tells them that the demon Narga has been revived in the ruins at the entrance to the laboratory and joins their party, turning out to be a flying warrior himself. Pepe, who lives in a hut, tells them that they need to find a stone tablet in the ruins and place it in the statue of Narga so that the entrance to the laboratory can open behind the waterfall. The other villagers inform them that Narga cannot be defeated without the Sword of Kan and the Mirror of Venus, and that Maradora, a thief, is trapped in the ruins. The party fights through more jungle, where they pass a bird who claims to be perched on the Tree of Spirits. Within the ruins, the party finds a talking jar upstairs that turns out to be Maradora, upon whom the spirits cast a spell for stealing their treasures. After bringing him back to the Tree, Rick reminds him of the spell that he needs to cast to turn back into a human. In this way, Rick obtains the Sword of Kan. The party finds the stone tablet deep within the ruins and brings it to the statue of Narga upstairs, which slides over, revealing the Mirror of Venus. They go back to the waterfall, and fight Narga himself at the entrance to the laboratory. Only Rick's Fire Tornado, which the Sword of Kan affords him, is capable of bringing Narga back from hiding in the Dark Field. Defeating Narga, they go on into the laboratory, where they encounter several Tusk Soldiers and the dead body of the director of GTG. Dargon appears and forces Rick to participate in a second martial arts tournament, with more Tusk Soldiers participating, and Dargon himself defending the title. After the tournament, the Moonlight Warriors invite the Flying Warriors to battle them in the Dark Dimension, where they have revived Demonyx. At Peking Restaurant in New York's Chinatown, the Flying Warriors meet the Shadow Cult, who are determined to access and root out the Moonlight Warriors, and pick up its young leader, Jimmy Cutler Jr., who turns out to be the fifth Flying Warrior. Jimmy informs the rest of the party that they will need to go deep within a decaying subway station in order to find the portal to the Dark Dimension. They find the relief key deep within the abandoned subway, and use it to open up the portal to the dark dimension. They fight the Moonlight Warriors, Selenos, Lunatos, Seiros, and Zakros, for deeper access. Because they have through fighting obtained the orbs of Courage, Wisdom, Justice, and Love, as well as the five dragma of the Mandara Talisman, along the way, they are able to fight Demonyx; Jimmy Cutler Jr.'s Meteor Shower is able to force Demonyx to reveal himself; the five Flying Warriors combine to become Dragonlord, and seal Demonyx away until next time; then they head to New York. Development =Regional differences= In the English game, Ryuhi was named Rick Stalker, and Fuzi Fu was named Dargon. Reception and legacy Some major characters later appeared in the North American versions of Hiry≈´ no Ken Gaiden and Hiry≈´ no Ken S: Golden Fighter, known as Fighting Simulator: 2-in-1 Flying Warriors and Ultimate Fighter. Rick Stalker and his mentor Gen also appeared as cameos in several titles in the Super Chinese series, also by Culture Brain. A manga adaptation based on the game was translated and published in the early issues of GamePro magazine.

It is distinct from bipartisanship, which aims to negotiate between \\"right\\" and \\"left\\", resulting in a dualistic perspective, and nonpartisanship, which tends to avoid political affiliation altogether. Philosophy Transpartisanship is a movement to support and advance a common ground‚Äîor \\"new center\\"‚Äîthat already existed in U.S. politics, emerging periodically into public view in the form of \\"unusual coalitions\\" of progressives and conservatives around issues ranging from war and the military budget to corporate power and the surveillance state.Husseini, Sam \\"The Perennially 'Unusual' Yet Somehow Ubiquitous Left-Right Alliance: Towards Acknowledging an Anti-Establishment Center\\". http://husseini.posthaven.com. 2013-07-25. Retrieved 2013-07-28. The movement builds on methods of facilitated dialogue, deliberation and conflict resolution. Current examples of transpartisan initiatives include Transpartisan Center, TheSolution.org, Reuniting America, Transpartisan Alliance, and Liberty Coalition. Transpartisanship is an emerging field that advocates pragmatic and effective solutions to social and political problems, transcending and including preexisting political ideologies. Transpartisanship encompasses the idea that all systems are inextricably interconnected, and that successful outcomes can best be reached through inclusive, genuine, and respectful cooperation. Transpartisan democracy, in part, seeks to reintegrate the public's voice in identifying, debating, and shaping governmental policies, while continuing to protect the sovereignty of the individual. The term \\"transpartisanship\\" has emerged to provide a meaningful alternative to \\"bipartisanship\\" and \\"nonpartisanship\\". Bipartisanship limits the dialogue process to two political viewpoints or entities, striving for compromise solutions. Nonpartisanship, on the other hand, tends to deny the existence of differing viewpoints in exchange for cooperation. Both the bipartisan and nonpartisan approaches can discount the multiplicity of viewpoints that exist, which often results in incomplete and therefore unsuccessful outcomes. In contrast to these, transpartisanship recognizes the existence and validity of many points of view, and advocates a constructive dialogue aimed at arriving at creative, integrated, and therefore, breakthrough solutions that meet the needs of all present. Transpartisan gatherings have resulted not only in surprisingly civil conversations noted by mainstream media but also in shifts from traditional ideological stances by some participants.Atlee, Tom. \\"A Personally Transformational Encounter of Left and Right\\". http://co- intelligence.org. 2004. Retrieved 2013-07-28. A close relative of transpartisanship is integral politics. A transpartisan approach to policy would necessarily include individual and collective, as well as subjective and objective, perspective. Furthermore, similar to integral theory, transpartisanship places politics in a developmental context, viewing democracy and prosperity not as static attainments, but rather emergent properties along a continuum of adult development. Transpartisan political parties =En Marche!= In 2016, Emmanuel Macron created a new French political party, En Marche. The party sought to transcend traditional political boundaries to be a transpartisan organisation. Macron has described the party as being a progressive party uniting the left and the right. Observers and political commentators have described the party as being both socially and economically liberal in ideology, Emmanuel Macron became the President of France. The party also won the National Assembly elections a month later, as candidates in the legislative elections included members of the Democratic Movement, as well as dissidents from the Socialist Party, The Republicans and minor parties. It won an absolute majority of seats in the National Assembly, securing 308 under its label and 42 for the MoDem. =Binaa Sudan Party= Binaa Sudan Party was established in February 2018 following an invitation from the Sudanese Shadow Government, a group of youth professionals who joined together to form a non-ideological organisation to produce a practical manifesto to put solutions for Sudan's state problems.

It was created in a split from area code 602 on March 19, 1995. Previously, 602 had been the sole area code for the entire state of Arizona since the introduction of area codes in 1947. With Arizona's rapid expansion during the second half of the 20th century, it was taken for granted that the state would require a second area code. However, the split was hastened by the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. History Originally, 520 encompassed the entire state outside the Phoenix metropolitan area, as well as a few outer portions of western and southern Maricopa County. It completely surrounded 602, which was retained by most of the Phoenix area. Within two years of its creation, however, 520 was already close to exhaustion due to the rapid growth of the Tucson area (and to a lesser extent Yuma and Flagstaff) as well as the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. In 2001, the northern and western portions of the old 520 split off as area code 928.

It is recognized as the leading national university, as ranked first by the Federal Ministry of Education for four successive years (2009 - 2012). The establishment of Jimma university dates back to 1952 when Jimma college of Agriculture was founded. The university got its current name in December 1999 following the amalgamation of Jimma College of Agriculture (founded in 1952) and Jimma Institute of Health Sciences (founded in 1983).The Official Website of Jimma University Overview The university is located in the city of Jimma, situated around 352 kilometers southwest of Addis Ababa. Its grounds cover some 167 hectares. JU is Ethiopia's first innovative community-oriented educational institution of higher learning, with teaching centers for health care students in Jimma, Omo Nada, Shebe, Agaro, and Asendabo.Directory of Potential Institutions for Testing Malaria Vaccines, Secretariat, African Malaria Vaccine Testing Network (Dar es Salaam, 2004), p. 37 JU is a pioneer in Public health training. It has academic and scientific collaboration with numerous national and international partners. JU also publishes the biannual Ethiopian Journal of Health Sciences, and launched the Jimma University Journal of Law in October 2007. Academics Jimma University is one of the largest and comprehensive public research universities in Africa. The University has more than 4,000 faculty and staff members. It also has twelve research facilities, a modern hospital, a community school, a community radio station (FM 102.0), an ICT center, libraries and revenue generating enterprises. The university is operating on four campuses and it is on the phase of establishing its fifth campus at Agaro.

The university has many national and international linkages and collaborations in the area of research, education and community service. Its innovative educational philosophy, staff commitment and motivation and availability of better research facility have helped the university in attracting both national and international partners. =Faculties, Institutes and Schools= The University consists of the following academic units:Academics * School of Graduate Studies * Institute of Technology * Institute of Education and Professional Development Studies * College Of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine * College of Business and Economics * College of Natural Sciences * College of Social Sciences and Law * College of Public Health and Medical Sciences * School of Art Initiatives Jimma University is highly committed to pioneering concepts, as reflected in its motto, the university was initially founded based on the concept of Community-Based Education (CBE). Throughout its history, the university has been committed to this scheme, and almost all of the academic curriculum are based on CBE programs. Jimma University is the first university in Africa that has established an exclusive office under the President's office to supervise all innovative programs across the university. =Jimma University College of Public Health and Medical Sciences= The establishment of the College of Health Sciences of Jimma University (JU) can be traced back to 1983 with the birth of the then Jimma Institute of Health Sciences (JIHS). The very beginning of the establishment of JIHS is marked as a continuation of the Ras Desta Damtew Health Assistant Training School established in 1967 by the Ethio-Netherlands health project in the premises of Jimma Hospital. On this foundation, the School of Nursing was established in 1983. Subsequently, the School of Medicine as well as the School of Pharmacy emerged in 1985; the School of Medical Laboratory Technology and the School of Environmental Health launched in 1987 and 1988, respectively. Jimma University teaching Hospital (JUTH) is one of the oldest public hospitals in the country. It was established in 1922. Geographically, it is located in Jimma city 352 km southwest of the capital Addis Ababa. It has been governed under the Ethiopian government by the name of ‚ÄúRas Desta Damtew Hospital‚Äù and later ‚ÄúJimma Hospital\\" during Dergue regime and currently Jimma University Specialized Teaching Hospital. Though old for its age, it had not made remarkable physical facility improvement for years. However, in the later times it became evident that some side-wing buildings were constructed by different stakeholders at different times to respond to the ever-growing pressure of service demand and clinical teaching need derived from the public and Jimma University respectively. Especially, after transfer of its ownership to Jimma University, the university has made relentless efforts in extensive renovation and expansion work to make the hospital conducive for service, teaching and research. Cognizant of the fast growing service and teaching role of the hospital, the federal government considered construction of a new and level- best 600 bedded hospital which‚Äô will be functional as of September 2015. =Department of Materials Science & Engineering= Department of Materials Science & Engineering, as a national role model for research-oriented departments, was established with a start-up budget of USD 10 million.

On 25 June 2020, Cllr John Boughtflower was elected as Leader of Spelthorne Borough Council and Cllr Jim McIlroy as his Deputy.
