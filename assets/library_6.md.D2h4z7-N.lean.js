Early life  Banda was born in Mzimba District and grew up in Chiradzulu District. Her father died when she was four years old, and she was raised by her mother. Despite growing in a singled-headed family, Memory defied the odds of early marriage in her community. Her sister Mercy was forced to marry at the age of 11 after she became pregnant during an initiation ceremony. At a young age, Memory aspired to be different from everybody and everything. She acknowledges that she was a tough girl. She had a voice, even though her culture reminded her to be quiet and silent because she was a girl child. Her journey is an inspiration to the girl children across the globe.  Activism  A 2014 Human Rights Watch report found that \\"one out of two girls in [Malawi] on average was married by her 18th birthday\\". Memory Banda has played an influential role at both community, national and recently international level, including presentation of a TED talk, speaking at the 59th United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, and at the Oslo Freedom Forum. She advocated for traditional leaders to formulate by-laws that protect the girl child and at national level she advocated for the legal age of marriage to be raised from 15 to 18 years of age. This led to the law being changed to recognize 18 years as the legal age of marriage in Malawi. But Memory is more concerned about the enforcement of the law and she continues to advocate for the girl-child empowerment. Memory has created Malawi’s Girls Empowerment Network (GENET) and Let Girls Lead girls community groups in an effort to keep girls in school and raise awareness of their rights. She collaborated on a story telling project were young girls shared their experiences,dreams and challenges they face through different forms of art and theater.

History The composition is based on the theme of a dance of 1589 entitled \\"O che nuova miracolo\\", an intermedio from the comedy Intermedi della Pellegrina, composed by Emilio de' Cavalieri on the occasion of the wedding of Ferdinando I de' Medici to Christina of Lorraine. The theme of the composition, later known as \\"Aria di Fiorenza\\" or \\"Ballo del Granduca\\", quickly gained renown in Europe and became the basis for at least 128 other songs, contemporary and later. Inspired by this theme, several composers produced variations, including Adriano Banchieri, Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger, and Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck. It is not clear, however, whether the variations on \\"Ballo del Granduca\\" attributed to Sweelinck are completely his work. Because some of his students, such as Samuel Scheidt, added variations to his different compositions (Scheidt and Sweelinck, in Pavana Hispanica, combined a series of alternating variations), some scholars hypothesize that Sweelinck wrote parts of Ballo del Granduca, but Scheidt also contributed. Structure The style of the composition is influenced by the two major currents of the period: Italian polyphony and the technique of English virginalists. From the Italian style Sweelinck assimilated the beauty of counterpoint, while from the virginalists he developed the virtuosity of passages, arpeggios, and fioriture (ornamentation). The dance includes a theme (although the score labels it 1e Variatie) and four variations (or five, if we count the theme as a first variation). The theme of the composition, which forms the basis for the variations, offers the improviser considerable of freedom. It consists of a series of five short musical phrases lasting four beats each, basically in chords, each one concluded by a cadence. The cadences are in G major (the tonic of the piece), C major, A minor, G major, and G major. The first variation shows several passages for the right hand with eighth notes and sixteenth notes, while the left hand performs an accompaniment in chords with two and three voices. In the second variation the hands are reversed: the right accompanies and the left plays the melody. The third variation contains most of the semicircular passages typical of the Sweelinck style. The piece ends with the fourth variation, the most challenging, where the right hand constantly performs third and sixth chords.

Early Career  The son of a railway worker, from the Zaporizhia region of Ukraine, he was educated at the Kharkov Institute of Mechanization and Electrification of Agriculture and worked as a farm labourer in the village on the Dnieper, and later as a factory worker, and joined the Communist Party in 1927. He enlisted in the Red Army in 1931, and trained at the Stalingrad school for military pilots in 1931-33.. After graduating, he became a flight instructor. In 1936, he made a record-breaking flight to Khabarovsk, in the Far East, in 54 hours and 13 minutes, to deliver an engineer and spare parts to the famous Soviet pilot, Valery Chkalov, who had damaged his plane in an accident. In September 1936, he was secretly sent to Spain to assist the republican side in the Spanish Civil War. From February 1937, he was commander of the First Bombardment Squadron, during the defence of Madrid, but was recalled to Moscow shortly after Soviet aircraft sank a German battleship off Ibiza, killed 31 German sailors, and provoking Hitler to retaliate by bombing Almería. On his return, he was rapidly promoted, as the higher ranks of military were decimated in the Great Purge. In 1938, he was appointed head of the Second Special Aviation Army on the Far Eastern Front.  Head of Military Intelligence  Proskurov was appointed head of Soviet military intelligence, the GRU, and deputy USSR People's Commissar for Defence, on 14 April 1939. Soon after his appointment, he picked up intelligence that the Nazi regime was planning to invade Poland, and wanted to open secret discussions with Moscow. The outcome was the non-aggression pact signed in August 1939, which preceded the dismemberment of Poland. Prior to the Soviet attack on Finland, in 1940, Proskurov inspected the Soviet front line and reached a scathing conclusion about the Red Army's preparedness, which earned him the enmity of the newly appointed People's Commissar for Defence, Semyon Timoshenko. After the Finnish debacle, when the Military Council met in April, Proskurov refused to accept Stalin's line that poor intelligence was to blame. Proskurov sent the first report to Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov and Marshal Timoshenko on 6 June 1940, warning that as soon as France had been forced to capitulate, the Germans would begin preparing an invasion of the USSR. On 19 June, he followed with a warning about the build up of German troops on the Lithuanian border. This conflicted with Stalin's unshakable belief that Hitler would honour the non- aggression pact.  Downfall  Proskurov was sacked in July 1940, and replaced by the more pliable Filipp Golikov. He was unemployed until October, when he was assigned a senior role managing bomber pilots. On 4 April 1941, Stalin sent Timoshenko a note saying that Proskurov be arrested, but the decision was delayed, and on 19 June he was appointed commander of the air forces of the Seventh Army. He had not taken up his command when the Germans attacked. He was on the northern front, in Karelia, when he was arrested on 27 June. He was one of a large group of former military officers who were shot on 28 October 1941.

He is the founder of the Frederick Mulder Foundation, The Funding Network, and Frederick Mulder Ltd. Early life and education Frederick Mulder was born in Chatham, Ontario, Canada in 1943. His father was a soldier who was wounded in France during action in World War II and later died in a British hospital. His mother remarried when he was nine years old, and he grew up in Eston, Saskatchewan. He later earned his bachelor's degree in English at the University of Saskatchewan, graduating in 1964. For graduate school, he attended Brown University, earning both a Master's degree and a PhD in Philosophy. For his doctorate, he worked under the supervision of a University of Oxford professor and wrote his dissertation at the English university in 1968. While studying at Oxford, Mulder purchased his first Picasso print, L'Ecuyere, for £18. Career After earning his doctorate, Mulder became a private art dealer specializing in European printmaking between 1470 and 1970, and in 1972 went to work for the London art dealership, Colnaghi, owned at the time by Jacob Rothschild. In 1988, Mulder met Pablo Picasso's linocut printer, Hidalgo Arnera. Over the years, Mulder formed a professional relationship with Arnera and after Arnera's death in 2006, Mulder purchased some of his private collection and archives, including his archives of Picasso linocuts. He sold part of the linocut collection to Ellen Remai who then donated the collection to the Remai Modern Art Gallery in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 2012. Mulder later donated 23 ceramics created by Picasso to the gallery. In 1986, Mulder founded the Frederick Mulder Charitable Trust (later renamed Frederick Mulder Foundation in 2014), a charitable trust that focuses on combating climate change and global poverty. The organization is funded largely by revenue from Frederick Mulder Ltd. In 2007, Mulder sold a 1935 Picasso etching, La Minotauromachie, at the New York Print Fair for a price in excess of $3 million. Seventy-five percent of that money went to the Frederick Mulder Foundation. Mulder also donated half of the $20 million earned from the 2012 sale of Picasso's linocut collection to his Foundation. In 2002, Mulder co-founded The Funding Network, another charitable organization that holds live crowdfunding events for social change projects. He also helped launch international affiliates and the organization now has or is setting up affiliates in over 20 countries.

It is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the western Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Pacific Ocean. Description This hydroid grows to a maximum height of but a more typical height is . The colony grows in a single plane with stiff erect stems growing from a fibrous base. The growth is pinnate, with alternate secondary branches which are parallel to one another and join the main stem at an angle of about 50°, giving a herring-bone appearance. These in turn have stubby tertiary branches which bear the hydrothecae (feeding polyps); these grow on alternate sides of the stem, forming short, equal-length segments, separated by transverse nodes. The polyps are large and goblet-shaped, with down-turned rims. The reproductive gonothecae are borne on the upper surfaces of the branches, the male structures being ovoid and club-shaped, while the female ones are oblong, with tapering bases and broad flat upper surfaces with apertures in the corners. Distribution and habitat This hydroid is known from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the western Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from Spitsbergen, through the Mediterranean Sea and the coasts of Western Europe and West Africa to South Africa. It is also present in western Iceland and eastern Greenland, and southwards along the eastern coasts of North America to the Caribbean Sea and Colombia. In the eastern Pacific Ocean its range extends from Alaska to California and it is also present in the Mollucas, Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. It grows on hard surfaces such as shells and stones in the shallow sub-littoral zone and in deeper water. Research Research has shown that there are two types of hydrothecae with different behaviours. The second type has a longer, extensible column and fewer, shorter, thicker tentacles armed with larger stinging cells. It can twist and coil during extension, and contract by bulging and folding while still remaining extended; both types of polyp can catch and ingest planktonic particles, but the extensible one is able to writhe around and explore a greater volume of water. It is probably used in defence and may also have an excretory or sensory function. Such polyp dimorphism has been reported in three other species of hydroid.

Bickford, Jr. Endowed Professor, the Associate Dean for Research, and the Chair of the Department of Nutrition and Food Science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at the University of Vermont. Her specialty is behavioral weight management with a specific focus on technology-based programs.  Biography  Harvey received her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees from Pennsylvania State University. She completed her fellowship in Adolescent Nutrition at the University of Washington in 1984. She received her doctorate in epidemiology from the University of Pittsburgh in 1991, advised by Rena Wing, PhD. She has been a faculty member at the University of Vermont in the Department of Nutrition and Food Science since 1991.  Research  Harvey is known for her work on technology-based weight management programs such as the Vtrim and iREACH programs. She also co-authored the Eating Well Diet book (with the editors of Eating Well magazine).  Technology-Based Weight Management Research  Harvey found tha participants in the interactive television program (VTrim) were as successful at losing weight as participants in the standard in-person program, and the television approach was more cost- effective. She found that participants who received internet-based support had similar weight maintenance to those who continued to meet in person. In the first iREACH trial, she and her colleagues compared an internet-based program (based on VTrim) to an in-person program and to a hybrid approach. They found that the internet-based approach achieved lower weight losses compared to the in-person condition, with no difference between the internet and hybrid approaches. In the second trial, they examined the potential of motivational interviewing to close the gap they found in weight loss in the first iREACH trial between weight losses in the internet-based program compared to the in- person program, but found no difference in weight losses The third trial investigates whether the addition of financial incentives for weight management behaviors and weight management outcomes will enhance online outcomes.  Research on Dietary Self-Monitoring  Harvey and colleagues compared monitoring with personal digital assistants to paper-and-pencil monitoring. They found that neither method produced better weight loss or self-monitoring adherence. In later research, they examined patterns of dietary self-monitoring in an online behavioral weight management program, and they found that different patterns of self-monitoring adherence emerged in the first four weeks of the program, such that those who had many continuous runs of self-monitoring log-ins were more likely to achieve clinically significant weight loss (>5%). In addition, they found no evidence of disparities in online dietary self-monitoring based on race or education level. In further research, theyfound that those who logged foods in a dietary monitoring website at least 2 times per day and at least 20 days within the month were more likely to achieve clinically significant weight loss (>5%).

Crimes  He was first reprimanded for committing lecherous acts with girls, spending a total of 12 years behind bars. After leaving Wronki Prison, Kwaśniak began a series of thefts, rapes and murders of young boys. The first attempt took place on April 20, 1990 in Bytom on Budryka Street. Under the pretense that he had received an envelope from the 10-year- old victim's father, Kwaśniak managed to enter the child's apartment. There, he began to strangle the boy with a towel, but the boy pretended to be dead. After the perpetrator left the flat, the boy informed his parents about the event. On May 7, 1990 in Radom, he robbed and murdered a 10-year-old boy. As before, he used a towel to strangle his victim. On May 24, 1990 in Wrocław, he attempted to rob, rape and murder an 11-year-old boy. He accosted the boy on the street, and under the pretense of picking up an envelope from the victim's apartment, he managed to enter the apartment. There he explained that he was going to take revenge on his father because he got Kwaśniak fired. He raped the boy, and then began strangling him with a towel. The boy fainted, but managed to survive. The perpetrator sent a letter to the flat: \\"Revenge! I waited 14 years!\\" On May 31, 1990, he carried out another murder in Szczecin. He strangled a 9-year-old boy with a towel, leaving a card next to the corpse which said: \\"Revenge, finally - Z.\\" On June 6, 1990, another boy was murdered in Kutno. Kwaśniak strangled him with a towel, after which he robbed the trap. After that, he wrote 'Revenge' on the bathroom mirror with lipstick. On June 18, 1990, he robbed and then murdered a 9-year-old on Szymanowski Street in Oława. The boy was strangled with a towel, and found next to him was a card with the inscription \\"Finally, I made the expected revenge -B.\\" was left. On January 3, 1991, he made a robbery on Topolowa Street in Zbąszyń. He tricked the boy into letting him into the apartment, and then stole money, a revaluation voucher and an insurance card. Thanks to the boy, a description of the perpetrator was established, which matched the descriptions made on the basis of witness testimonies from previous acts: a man aged 30-35, well-built, a height of 1,75 cm., dark hair and carrying a weapon. On February 26, 1991, in Rataje, he robbed and murdered a 12-year-old boy. The boy was strangled with a towel. Witnesses who saw the man talking with the boy were quickly established, and it was possible to determine how the perpetrator dressed. The police action to catch the murderer had the code name of Revenge. On the basis of all data, in February 1991, it was possible to connect all murders to one man. The police in Poznań collected details from previous murders, and commissioned sexologist Lechosław Gapik to develop a psychological portrait of the perpetrator. The issue was publicized by the \\"997\\" publivision program, which reconstructed the murders and gave the perpetrator a modus operandi and portrait. Thanks to these actions, it was established that the perpetrator had accosted boys in Rataje for a few days, with whose help a facial composite was made and published on the media, as well as at bus stops and in taxis. For any help in catching the perpetrator, the Provinicial Police Chief of Poznań set a prize of 5,000,000 Polish złoty. Despite this, on March 7, 1991 in Wrocław, Kwaśniak raped another boy. Under the pretext of giving the parents of the boy a letter from his aunt who lived abroad, he managed to enter the apartment. On April 18, 1991, he attacked once again Sosnowiec, but his victim managed to survive.  Arrest  On April 22, 1991, the police in Poznań received a signal from the headmaster of Primary School No. 6 on the Rusa Housing Estate about students who were being accosted by a suspicious man. Later, the same application was made by a woman who, during a walk around the estate, noticed that same strange man. As a result of this, the man was soon detained on one of the residential streets. During the interrogation, the man, who turned out to be Kwaśniak, admitted to the murders in Oława, Kutno, Szczecin, Radom and Poznań, to the attempted murders in Bytom and in Wrocław, and to the rape in Sosnowiec. He also admitted to several dozen apartment thefts, including in Słupsk, Białystok, Lublin, Kraków, Częstochowa, Bydgoszcz, Szczecin and Wejherowo.  Death  On July 24, 1991, Kwaśniak committed suicide in his prison cell, hanging himself with a bandage. In connection with his death, the investigation was discontinued.

Having dealt with the distant past in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (2011) and with the distant future in Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (2016), Harari turns in 21 Lessons his attention to the present. In a loose collection of essays, many based on articles previously published, he attempts to untangle the technological, political, social, and existential quandaries that humankind faces. The book itself consists of five parts which are each made up of four or five essays. Critical response The review aggregator website Book Marks reported that 44% of critics gave the book a \\"rave\\" review, whilst 11% of the critics \\"panned\\" the book. The rest of the critics expressed either \\"positive\\" (22%) or \\"mixed\\" (22%) impressions, based on a sample of nine reviews. The book has received significant media attention with articles and reviews published by The New York Times, The Economist, Financial Times, The Guardian, New Statesman and The Times among others. In The New York Times, Bill Gates calls the book “fascinating” and his author “such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking.” For Gates, Harari “has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the 21st century.” John Thornhill in Financial Times said that “[a]lthough 21 Lessons is lit up by flashes of intellectual adventure and literary verve, it is probably the least illuminating of the three books” written by Harari, and that many of the observations in it feel recycled from the two others. Helen Lewis review in The Guardian is not as glowing although she admires “the ambition and breadth of his work, smashing together unexpected ideas into dazzling observations.” The book has also received negative reviews. Gavin Jacobson in the New Statesman sees it as “a study thick with promise and thin in import” with advice “either too vague or too hollow to provide any meaningful guidance.” In The Times, Gerard DeGroot writes: \\"The author of Sapiens is good at identifying the crises to come but his syrupy platitudes are no answer.\\" Controversy with Russian translation A Russian translation of Harari's book was published in June 2019. However, the Russian media noticed that several passages about Russia and its President Putin were excluded from the translation. In particular, the chapter about post-truth begins in the Russian edition with referring to Donald Trump's speeches instead of Putin's false statements during Russian annexation of Crimea. The representatives of Harari admitted that this change was authorized. Leonid Bershidsky in Moscow Times called it \\"caution — or, to call it by its proper name, cowardice\\", and Nettanel Slyomovics in Haaretz claimed that Harari \\"is sacrificing those same liberal ideas that he presumes to represent\\". In a response, Harari stated that he \\"was warned that due to these few examples Russian censorship will not allow distribution of a Russian translation of the book\\" and that he \\"therefore faced a dilemma,\\" namely to \\"replace these few examples with other examples, and publish the book in Russia,\\" or \\"change nothing, and publish nothing,\\" and that he \\"preferred publishing, because Russia is a leading global power and it seemed important that the book’s ideas should reach readers in Russia, especially as the book is still very critical of the Putin regime – just without naming names.\\" https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/yuval-noah-harari-responds-to-backlash- after-he-let-russia-censor-his-book-1.7576761  References  2018 non-fiction books Books about human intelligence Books about historiography History books about civilization Books by Yuval Noah Harari Futurology books Spiegel & Grau books ","title":"21 Lessons for the 21st Century"},{"id":"58790754","text":"Ali Kamal Etman (6 June 1941 - 18 June 2020) was an Egyptian footballer.

The company was sold to the Swire Group in 2003, eventually ceasing operations in 2009. Initially a tramp operator of sailing vessels, it developed into a major company operating shipping lines all over the world. The original Olivebank  History  Andrew Weir, from Glasgow, Scotland, who came from a family of cork merchants, became a ship owner in 1885 when he purchased a barque, already known as the Willowbank. He then rapidly developed a fleet of sailing vessels that became the largest fleet sailing under the British flag. Weir purchased his first steamship in 1896. Named the Duneric, this was the first of the vessels that he had had built not to have the suffix “bank”, which was not used for his steamships. Bank Line Ltd formally came into operation in 1905, when the Head Office was moved to London, close to the Baltic Exchange, where shipping contracts are exchanged. Until then most of the ships owned by Weir had been operated by one-ship companies. By 1917, Weir had sold the last of his windjammers and the use of “bank” in the vessel's name had temporarily died out. Weir purchased 43 steamships between 1896 and World War 1. Launch of the Thursobank Starting out in business as a tramp operator of sailing ships, Andrew Weir saw the opportunity presented by the introduction of steamships to enter liner shipping conferences. Routes developed included India to Africa and South Africa to South-East Asia. The Bank Line's Pacific Islands service began initially as a charter business for Lever Brothers, a major soap manufacturer, carrying copra and coconut oil to Lever's factories in Europe. Ships on this service were among the few Bank Line vessels that regularly visited the United Kingdom and this fact, plus the exotic locations visited, made the route popular with the Bank Line's sailors. Eight further steamships were purchased after World War 1 to use on the liner routes. In 1919 the company also took over the management of the fleet of the British-Mexican Petroleum Company, eventually operating 12 steam tankers. Andrew Weir, 1st Baron Inverforth After World War 1, Bank Line ordered 18 oil-fired twin-screw motor vessels from Harland and Wolff in Glasgow and these went into service between 1924 and 1926. All had “bank” as a suffix to the name: some were named after trees, such as Elmbank and Olivebank, while others took their names from Scottish geographical features, such as Clydebank. The first ship delivered was the Inverbank and this gave its name to the whole class of vessels. Eight of these were lost during the Second World War and one, the Speybank was captured and used as a minelayer. The last of the class was scrapped in 1960. Bank Line also ordered 12 new steamships and motorships from Workman, Clark and Company in Belfast between 1928 and 1934. Most of these also had the “bank” name suffix. The three that didn't were passenger ships that often carried indentured Indian labourers to work on sugar plantations. In addition to these new vessels the Line also bought-in a number of existing ships. From 1934 to 1940 a further 19 cargo ships were delivered by Harland and Wolff, Workman Clark, William Doxford & Sons and John Readhead & Sons. The Speybank, captured by the Germans in WW2 and renamed Doggerbank Many Bank Line vessels were sunk in World War 2 and by the end of the war the Line was left with 31 ships, of which six were steamships. Many of the vessels were by then over twenty years old. Six new ones were added between 1952 and 1955, but the major expansion began in 1957. The new ships, which were mainly 12,000dwt tweendeck vessels, were larger and faster and consisted of 24 vessels from Doxford's, 23 from Harland & Wolff in Belfast and 2 from Swan Hunter on the River Tyne. All were built to standard Bank Line designs. From 1963 a further 36 vessels of 15,000+dwt were built in the same shipyards. The last Bank Line order was placed in 1977 and delivered in 1979. In the 1950s Bank Line was heavily involved in the liner trade but also continued to carry out tramping. Many of the liner services operated through Calcutta, with routes to eastern, southern and western Africa, Argentina and the west coast of South America. Other routes included the United States Gulf to Australia and New Zealand and the Papua New Guinea and Pacific Islands to Europe service. Durban was an important centre as the Oriental African Line resumed service after the war and began to visit Japan again and was extended to serve Taiwan, the Philippines, East Malaysia, and Thailand. Over time the Bank Line began to suffer from the movement towards container shipping and also changes to trading circumstances such as the decline in jute exports through Calcutta, the sale of Papua New Guinea copra to Japan rather than Europe, and the boycott of trading with South Africa by India because of apartheid. In 1979 the company took delivery of its last six multipurpose ships, known as the “Fish” class because they were all named after fish, such as Troutbank and Roachbank. By the second half of the 1970s, the Bank Line's business was centered on the US Gulf, involving liner sailings from ports such as Houston and New Orleans to South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, the UK and the rest of Europe. For a time the South Pacific trade was consolidated into the Australian and New Zealand routes but this proved inefficient. In 1977 the Bank Line partnered with the Shaw, Savill & Albion Line to form the Bank and Savill Line to provide container services between the US Gulf and Australia and New Zealand. Three container vessels were commissioned for this route. Difficulties were experienced because of the incompatible container systems used by southern hemisphere and USA shippers. In the 1990s changes were made to the South Pacific route which became a westbound round-the-world service using both the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal. In 1995 the Bank Line bought four SA-15 Class ships that had been built in Finland and chartered two others. One of these, the Boularibank, was attacked by Somalian pirates at the entrance to the Gulf of Aden in April 2009. Unable to outrun the attackers, the vessel carried out evasive manoeuvres while under fire. It was eventually rescued by a destroyer of the Russian Navy. The captain was awarded the Merchant Navy Medal for exceptional bravery during the attack.http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article6887906.ece Skipper’s award for repelling a pirate attack.

It was independent at some point in the Archaic period. Situated in a plateau in the region of Mount Helicon in the southeast of Boeotia, it was between Thisbe and Coroneia, near modern Agia Anna in the plain of Kourkoura, which at approximately was sufficient to sustain a small polis. Later its territory was divided between Thisbe and Coroneia.Plutarch, Moralia 774 F-775 B. Hippotae also figures in a tale in Greek mythology. Phocus of Glisas, was father of a beautiful daughter Callirhoe. She was wooed by thirty suitors, but Phocus was hesitant to let his daughter marry one of them. At last he announced he would be consulting the Pythian Oracle before making a final decision; the suitors got outraged by that and killed Phocus. Callirhoe had to flee from the suitors; some peasants hid her away in the grain, and thus she escaped them. During the festival of Pamboeotia, she went to the shrine of Athena Itonia at Coroneia and revealed the crime of her suitors to the public; the people sympathized with her and declared a war on her father's murderers. Those sought refuge first in Orchomenus, and then at Hippotae. The inhabitants of Hippotae refused to deliver them up, so the Boeotian army under command of the Theban governor Phoedus captured the town, enslaved its citizens and stoned the suitors to death. The town was destroyed, and the land divided between Thisbe and Coroneia. The night before the capture of Hippotae, a voice coming from Mount Helicon had repeatedly been heard at the town; it would utter \\"I'm here\\", and the suitors recognized it as that of Phocus. On the day the suitors were executed, Phocus' tomb ran with saffron. Phoedus, on his way back home, received the news that a daughter was born to him, and decided to name her Nicostrate (\\"Victorious Army\\").Plutarch, Amatoriae Narrationes, 4 References Populated places in ancient Boeotia Former populated places in Greece Boeotian city-states Locations in Greek mythology ","title":"Hippotae"},{"id":"58790896","text":"Edward Aggrey-Fynn (24 November 1934 - January 2005) was a Ghanaian footballer.

The discovery was made in 1945 and it is believed that the body had lain undiscovered for 60 years. Inquiries named a strong (but unconfirmed) candidate for the identity of the decedent; however, the cause of death and the reason for their presence in the cylinder remain a mystery. Discovery of the cylinder In the summer of 1943 American soldiers were clearing a blitzed site at the back of the Methodist Church on Boundary Street East in Liverpool. An American bulldozer uncovered the cylinder while it was clearing building debris. One end of the cylinder was capped with a steel plate and the other was open. The bulldozer moved the cylinder and during the operation it unintentionally crushed the open end. Building contractors then extracted the cylinder from the building rubble and laid it level. After the summer of 1943 the cylinder went largely unnoticed. A local witness, Norman Garner of 278 Great Homer Street, stated that he had seen people use the cylinder as a seat and children often played with it. About two weeks prior to the discovery of the body witnesses saw children rolling the cylinder across from some waste land in Great Homer Street to Claudia Street.  Description of the cylinder  The cylinder had a length of a diameter of and was made of gauge 9 steel which has a thickness of . The metal cap to the closed end of the cylinder was bolted in place. The open end of the cylinder had been compressed, and almost crimped shut, by the bulldozer leaving an aperture of only . No traces of paint were found inside the cylinder and the opinion in 1945 was that it had been part of a ventilation shaft.  Discovery of the body  On 13 July 1945 three small boys were playing with the cylinder. They were rolling it through the streets when one tried to see what was inside. At first they saw what appeared to be a shoe; however, on closer inspection it appeared to be part of a human skeleton. The police were called to the scene and they used an oxy- acetylene burner to cut the cylinder open. The contents were revealed to be a complete human skeleton accompanied by a number of items. The police removed the remains and took them to the mortuary.  Description of the victim  The remains were found to be those of an adult male who would have been about tall in life. It was thought, in 1945, that the man was aged between 25 and 50 at the time of his death. The body appeared to have been in situ for a long time. The left base of the skeleton's skull was missing. The cranium was broken near to the left middle-ear but this did not appear to be due to violence. The head and torso had become detached at some point through movement. A small amount of hair was found still adhered to the skull. It appeared that the man had crawled into the cylinder. The position of the skeleton suggested that the man was lying down and using a brick wrapped in sacking as a pillow when he died. The body was found fully clothed and lying full length on some sacking but not within it. He was dressed in clothes typical of the later Victorian period and they appeared to be of good quality.  Items found with body  Numerous items were found with the body. These items included two diaries, seven heavily corroded keys and some miscellaneous papers. No money or other valuables were found in the decedent's pockets. The list of items found in the cylinder, as reported in 1945, is as follows:  Investigation  The inquest was opened on 19 July 1945 and adjourned for a month by the Liverpool Coroner Mr G C Mort. There was no evidence that the man had been killed in the blitz as had been suspected initially. The pathologist noted a large amount of moisture in the cylinder which indicated three possible scenarios. 1. The victim could have been in the unsealed cylinder for about 10 years. 2. The cylinder could have been sealed airtight. 3\\\\. There could have been moisture ingress and it had not dried out. The last two scenarios indicated that it was possible that the body had been in the cylinder since 1885 or 1890. Conditions in the cylinder indicated that the body had undergone normal decomposition. On 31 August 1945 the coroner closed the inquest by recording an open verdict stating that it was impossible to establish cause of death due to insufficient information. The date of death was believed to have been 1885. Thomas Creegan Williams In August 1945 the inquest named T C Williams, a paint and brush manufacturer of 5 Leeds Street, Liverpool, as a potential identity for the decedent. T C Williams and Co. were a paint, varnish and colour merchants in Tithebarn Street with works in Smithfield Street around 1885. Thomas Creegan Williams lived at 29 Cambridge Road in Seaforth, then Woodville House, Abbotsford Road in Blundellsands. Williams was declared bankrupt on 10 March 1884. The inquest hypothesised that Williams had left his family home due to financial difficulties and was sleeping in the cylinder at what were assumed to be his business premises. Somehow the cylinder became sealed and he asphyxiated. It was thought that his disappearance may have been interpreted in 1885 as deliberate absconding in order to avoid his creditors; working one's passage to another country via ship was not an unknown method of escaping debt at the time. According to records obtained by the inquiry, Williams’s wife was buried alone in Liverpool but no records of the death of Williams or his burial in Liverpool could be found. Indeed, there were no records in England and Wales of a T C Williams being buried. T C Williams had one son born 1859. The inquiry sought relatives of Williams but had no success at the time.

The line closed in 1967 to all traffic and the track was dismantled in 1970. The line also connected to the former Stoke-Market Drayton Line at Market Drayton which was a junction station for the line until the closure to Madeley Chord in 1956. Wellington and Drayton Railway The Wellington and Drayton Railway was incorporated on 7 August 1862, and in November of that year deposited plans for a line connecting Wellington to Market Drayton, together with extensions northwards towards Manchester, to join the LNWR near Minshull Vernon, the Cheshire Midland Railway near Knutsford, the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway and the Bolton Railway at Salford, to provide the Great Western Railway with access to Manchester. Additionally there were plans for a branch from Market Drayton to Newcastle-under-Lyme, but these were abandoned due to opposition from the LNWR and North Staffordshire Railway. Circumstances changed rapidly, and alliance with the Nantwich and Market Drayton Railway together with running powers from Nantwich to Crewe and onwards to Manchester through amalgamation of the Great Western Railway with the West Midland Railway meant that the northern extensions were no longer needed by the GWR for access to Manchester. The line ran from Drayton Junction (52.7031°N 2.5317°W), on the Shrewsbury and Wellington Joint Line just west of Wellington station, to an end-on junction with the Nantwich and Market Drayton Railway at Market Drayton (52.9093°N 2.4895°W), a distance of some 16 miles. Construction started in 1864, and the line was opened in 1867. The Consulting Engineer was John Fowler. After the first meeting at Malvern, all subsequent Directors' Meetings were held at Paddington station, with Directors supplied by the GWR, and an Act of 14 July 1864 authorised the transfer of the Wellington and Drayton Railway to the GWR on completion of the line. However, this transfer was not formally sealed until 30 August 1877. Nantwich and Market Drayton Railway The company was provisionally formed in 1860 as the Market Drayton and Madeley Railway, then changed its name to Nantwich and Market Drayton Railway on or before 3 April 1861, and incorporated in June 1861. The first Chairman was Reginald Corbet, of nearby Adderley Hall. The single track line was built from the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Crewe and Shrewsbury Railway line just south of Nantwich to a terminus at Market Drayton, a distance of ten miles. Construction started in 1862 and the line opened in October 1863. Proposals were for the railway to be worked by the LNWR, but instead the Great Western Railway took on this role and worked the nominally independent line until it was taken over by the GWR in 1897. The line was doubled during 1866–67, to match the Wellington and Drayton Railway which opened in October 1867, thus providing a link for the GWR between the Midlands and the Northwest. Stoke Railway The North Staffordshire Railway line from Stoke to Market Drayton opened in January 1870, joining the line at Silverdale Junction, just north of Market Drayton. This closed to all traffic from Market Drayton to Madeley Chord in 1956. Traffic Traffic along the route was surprisingly very high and so were the passenger numbers even during the railmotor years with the halts along the line at Coole Pilate, Coxbank, Little Drayton, Wollerton, Ellerdine, Rowton and Longdon. The stations on the line were Crudgington, Peplow, Hodnet, Tern Hill, Market Drayton, Adderley and Audlem. Closure Passenger services ceased on to Newcastle-Under-Lyme and Stoke-On-Trent in 1956. Passenger services continued to Nantwich and Wellington until 1963 when the service ceased following the Beeching Axe. Traffic continued to pass through Market Drayton until 1967 when the line from Wellington to Nantwich ceased operation and the track was dismantled in 1970. Present day The line has been converted into a footpath from Wellington to near the site of Hodnet, from there. The trackbed has returned to agricultural use and the Drayton Bypass now uses a section of the line from Tern Hill to Market Drayton. The site of Market Drayton is now a Tesco supermarket and a factory complex has occupied a section of the station site and trackbed although the former tunnel can still be seen from Tescos. The trackbed to Audlem is now agriculture and is mostly intact to Nantwich. Nantwich and Market Drayton Railway Society On New Year's Day 1992, The Market Drayton Railway Preservation Society (renamed Nantwich & Market Drayton Railway Society in 2010) was set up in order to preserve what remained of the old railway line between Nantwich and Market Drayton on the Cheshire–Shropshire Border. A new site would have to required for Market Drayton as the old site no longer exists now being a supermarket, while other parts of the line between Coxbank and Audlem have changed slightly since the line's heyday. As of April 2012 the society held meetings most months to provide talks about how a part of the line could be preserved. The society have not been able to get backing from local councils due to the safety concerns of reopening a level crossing near Audlem.

She created a mystery when she published a sequel to one of Coleridge's poems before he had published his work. It was claimed that Vardill's poem was not hers but later evidence discovered after her death that this was her poem. There is a Vardill Society that is gathering her forty years of publications together. Life Vardill was born in London. Her father was the American loyalist and spy John Vardill. Her father was the rector of Skirbeck and Fishtoft in 1791 and she was brought up there, in Galloway and London. Her father was indulgent and spent many hours with her reading classical poetry together. Her mother, Agnes, was left an inheritance which came to her as the only legitimate heir. A nephew who had been made legitimate when his parents married challenged her claim and the case went to court. The Chancery court found in Agnes's favour but the nephew challenged the case. Vardill was writing poetry for her school's production at the age of fifteen with the music by Dr. Samuel Arnold. She acknowledged her father's contribution in her first book in 1809. In a later tribute she wrote: \\"These and the subsequent lines are a feeble tribute to the memory of a most revered and lamented father\\"Axon, Transactions, pp. 63-64 An inscription for a memorial tablet written by his daughter was published in the European Magazine, February, 1811: if the commissioners denied his right to a Regis Professorship, his poet daughter repeatedly named him by that title,The European Magazine, and London Review, Volumes 59-60, Philological Society of London, 1811, p. 134 and made sure by essays, poems, and this tablet, that history would so remember him. Her father died in 1811. In 1815 she created a mystery for later students when she published a sequel to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem \\"Christabel\\" in the European Magazine in August 1815. The mystery was how was this possible as Coleridge did not publish his original poem until almost a year later in May 1816.Wu, Duncan, Romanticism: An Anthology, p 528, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Blackwell, 1994, In 1822 she moved to Kirkcudbright to live at her new husband's estate in Scotland. She took Peter Niven's name but still continued to use the nom de plume of \\"V\\". In 1825 the poet Eleanor Anne Porden died of tuberculosis as her husband sailed out to find the North West Passage. Porden left her attic chest to Vardill and in 1830 she used this as the subject of a poem addressed to her five-year-old daughter. By 1834 Coleridge was dead and John Abraham Heraud published his view that Vardill's 1815 poem that was a sequel to Coleridge's poem was actually written by Coleridge. Started to publish her work with for the European Magazine in 1809 and she would continue to publish there until 1852. Later in life, widowed after her marriage to James Niven, she later became a close friend of novelist Mary Russell Mitford. Vardill had homes in London and Skipton. She died in Skipton in 1852. Legacy Anna Jane Vardill Niven frontispiece by William Axon The journalist and antiquary William Axon published his study of Vardill's poem in 1908. Based on new evidence he was able to assure the Royal Society of Literature that he was sure that the poem had been written by Vardill.

His 1949 novel Call It Treason, drawn from his war experience using captured German soldiers to re-enter the Third Reich to gather intelligence, earned him a first prize cash award in a contest by the Christophers, \\"an organization devoted to bringing Christian principles into everyday life.\\" The novel was turned into a 1951 Hollywood film, Decision Before Dawn.  World War II and novel   O.S.S. Operative  During the war, Howe served with the Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S.), the precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency. Working for an O.S.S. detachment with the U.S. Seventh Army in France, Howe provided documents and cover stories for German P.O.W. soldiers recruited to re-enter the Reich in the last months of the war to collect intelligence. According to writer Joseph E. Persico, the \\"handsome and urbane architect of middle age . . . seemed to take a childlike delight in this late-blooming career in professional deception.\\" There was nothing childlike in the missions the German soldier-recruits undertook, however. They \\"confronted German land mines and machine-gun nests on the way out and American defenses on the way back.\\" They also faced detection—and execution—in Nazi Germany itself.  The Saga of \\"Happy\\"  Call It Treason and the film based on it addressed these dangers by focusing on one young German soldier-recruit code-named \\"Happy.\\" In the novel, he is fatally shot by a German soldier as he attempts to swim the Rhine River and return to American lines. In the film, Happy is captured and executed by German soldiers after creating a diversion so an American intelligence officer can safely swim the Rhine to re-cross into American lines. Suggesting the factual basis of his novel, Howe dedicated the book \\"To Happy 1925-45.\\" In a foreword to the novel, the author reprinted a sorrowful 1947 letter he wrote he had received from Happy's father seeking information about his son's fate. At the book's end, the author recounts that he had responded to the original letter from Happy's father, telling him what had happened to his son. The novel ends with a second letter from the father, noting that both he and his wife were grateful to Howe \\"for having seen as deep into our boy's heart as only we had seen.\\" The authenticity of the father's letters is fairly clear. In fact, a contemporary review of the book in The New York Times noted that it was based \\"upon an actual episode. Its general authenticity is beyond doubt.\\"  Architecture career and death  According to an obituary in The Washington Post, Howe wrote the novel while recovering from serious injuries in a car accident. He wrote various other novels and short stories and also had poems published in The New Yorker. He graduated from Harvard College in 1918 and served with the U.S. Navy in Ireland during World War I. He earned a master's in architecture in 1925 and practiced with his architect-father, Wallis Eastburn Howe, in Providence, Rhode Island. He moved to Washington, D.C. in the 1930s where he worked with the Public Buildings Administration. He entered private practice with a series of partners from 1940 to the early 1960s, becoming a prominent architect in the capital. His firms were credited with designing and constructing more than 600 buildings, many erected in Georgetown. He died at 79 on June 19, 1977 after surgery at a Veterans Administration Hospital in Salem, Virginia.

Callava was an officer in the Spanish military who had been rapidly promoted due to his service in the Peninsular War — the Battle of Almonacid in particular, for which he was knighted into the Royal and Military Order of Saint Hermenegild in 1811. He became a colonel and governor before the age of 40. James Parton's Life of Andrew Jackson describes Callava thus: He was a Castilian ... of light complexion, a handsome, well- grown man, of dignified presence and refined manners. After the transfer of Florida to the United States as part of the Adams–Onís Treaty, Callava remained for a time in Pensacola acting as a representative of Spain and overseeing the embarkation of artillery and other unfinished business. During this time, Callava came into conflict with Andrew Jackson, the newly appointed military commissioner and governor of the Florida Territory, due to a dispute over the estate of Nicolás María Vidal, a Spanish official in Louisiana and Florida. Callava was ordered to hand over documents related to the disposition of the estate to Vidal's daughters; when he did not comply, Jackson had him jailed and had the records removed from Callava's house. Once the records were in American hands, Jackson released Callava. Callava blamed the dispute, in part, on a lack of translators to aid in communication between himself and the Americans. Following his release, Callava headed to Washington to lodge a formal complaint against Jackson through the Spanish minister.

The site of the temple was in the Carinae district on the Esquiline Hill, and was reputedly built on the site where the house of Spurius Cassius Viscellinus once stood.Planter, pg.511 The houses of Mark Antony and Cicero stood close to the temple, and Cicero restored the temple around 54 BCE after it had become run down, as he had gained possession of some land that had belonged to the temple. The temple was occasionally used for meetings of the Senate, and on its walls was displayed a map of Italy. It was destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome in 64 CE, but was subsequently rebuilt. It was still listed in the Notitia as standing in the 4th century, located in the Regio IV Templum Pacis.

At Renwick Gallery their collaborative work incorporated ornithological objects such as eggs and nests, with eggs variously smashed, smeared across canvas, hollowed out, and marked up with text. Marrin’s 2017 solo show with David Lewis Gallery followed the course of a corpse flower bloom, represented in the style of a vanitas or memento mori. “Given B-movie titles such as The Breed and The Hunger (both 2016),” wrote Zack Hatfield in Artforum, “their debt to the floral abstractions of O’Keeffe originates not in reductive Freudian readings, but in how both artists approach an individual subject from various perspectives in order to glean its essence.”  Exhibitions  Marrin has exhibited internationally in two-person and group exhibitions at WIELS Contemporary Art Center, Brussels (with Elif Erkan); Svetlana, New York (with Nora Schultz); Renwick Gallery, New York (with Tyler Dobson); Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin Office Baroque, Brussels; Mitchell Algus Gallery, NY; Bortolami Gallery, New York; Bureau, New York; Foxy Production, New York; and Rivington Arms, New York; among others.

The sole example remained in service up to outbreak of World War II. Design and development The ITS-IV was a high performance, two seat research sailplane designed initially by Adam Nowotny to gather meteorological and airframe stress data. It was also intended to provide blind flying training. Franciszek Kotowski took over the design work after Nowotny's death in July 1934, producing the ITS-IVB. It was an all-wood aircraft. The two part wing had a rectangular plan central section and gently tapering trapezoidal outer panels with blunted tips. Each part was built around a single plywood D-box spar which formed the leading edge. On each side an internal auxiliary drag strut ran diagonally from the spar at about mid-span to the rear of the wing root and the whole area between spar and strut was ply-covered, forming another box. Elsewhere, the wings were fabric-covered, as were the differential ailerons which filled the trailing edges of the outer panels. The wing bracing was unusual, with the normal rigid struts replaced by upper and lower steel ribbons on each side. Each upper ribbon ran from a central cabane, formed from three steel tubes, to a reinforced region of the spar. The lower ribbons ran from the spars to the lower fuselage. They offered less air resistance and also provided a way to measure wing loads in flight. The fuselage was a ply-covered semi-monocoque structure with an oval cross-section. It was unusually wide and deep in the central section, tapering away strongly aft of the wings. This variation allowed an uncramped, enclosed pilot's cockpit ahead of the wing and a very generous cabin for the observer, with celluloid-paned underwing windows on each side and accessed via a port side door. The cabin also had a table which could be folded away to allow use of the dual flight controls under blind flying conditions. A sprung landing skid was mounted below. The empennage was conventional, with a cantilever, tapered tailplane and elevators mounted on top of the fuselage and a fin carrying a full, rounded, deep, rudder hinged behind the elevators. The fixed surfaces were ply-covered and the control surfaces fabric-covered. Operational history The ITS-VB's first flight was on 30 July 1935, piloted by its designer and towed by a RWD 8 from Lwów- Skniłów. This revealed aileron flutter and required aileron redesign, after which the glider was stable and handled well. It participated in the Third National Glider Contest held at Ustjanowa Górna in the autumn of 1935 and continued research flying until the start of World War II, based at Bezmiechowa Górna and mostly flown by Piotr Mynarski.

The Temple of Diana Nemorensis was an ancient Roman sanctuary erected around 300 BC and dedicated to the goddess Diana. The temple was situated on the northern shore of Lake Nemi beneath the cliffs of the modern city Nemi (Latin nemus Aricinum). It was a famous place of pilgrimage in the Italian peninsula. The temple complex covered an area of 45000 square meters. Historical evidence suggests that worship of Diana at Nemi flourished from at least the 6th century BCEGordon, A.E. (1932). \\"On the Origin of Diana\\", Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 63 (1932, pp. 177-192) p 178. The temple was abandoned at some point in the late Roman Empire period. If still in use by the 4th-century, it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Portions of its marbles and decorations were removed. The area of the temple was gradually covered by forest and generally left undisturbed for centuries. Amateur archaeological excavations of the site began in the 1600s. Qualities The temple of Diana Nemorensis was preceded by the sacred grove in which there stood a carved cult image. The temple was noted by Vitruvius as being archaic and \\"Etruscan\\" in its form.Vitruvius, 4.8.4. A. E. GordonGordon, The Cults of Aricia, 7f. has observed that \\"the comparatively late date of the excavated remains of the sanctuaryThe complicated histories of excavations at Nemi is traced in English in Mysteries of Diana: The Antiquities from Nemi in Nottingham Museums (Castle Museum, Nottingham, 1983). See also F. Coarelli, I santuari del Lazio in età repubblicana (Rome, 1987:165-85). does not preclude the dedication of the grove at the end of the sixth century.\\" Andreas Alföldi has demonstrated that the cult image still stood as late as 43 BC, when it was reflected in coinage.Alföldi, \\"Diana Nemorensis\\", American Journal of Archaeology (1960:137-44) p 141. The Italic type of the triform cult image of Diana Nemorensis was reconstructed by Alföldi from a sequence of later Republican period coins he connected with a gens from Aricia.Alföldi 1960:137-44. A small marble head from Nemi in the Museo delle Terme, suggested Enrico Paribeni, was an archaising replica of the form the goddess took at Nemi, in American Journal of Archaeology 1961:55f; see also P.J. Riis, \\"The cult image of Diana Nemorensis\\" Acta Archaeologica 37 (Copenhagen) 1966:37-65. Further examples of these denarii are at Coinarchives.com. In early examples the three goddesses stand before a sketchily indicated wood, the central goddess placing her right hand on the shoulder of one goddess and her left on the hip of the other. The three are shown to be one by a horizontal bar behind their necks that connects them. Later die-cutters simplified the image. Alföldi interpreted the numismatic image as the Latin Diana \\"conceived as a threefold unity of the divine huntress, the Moon goddess, and the goddess of the nether world, Hekate,\\" noting that Diana montium custos nemoremque virgo (\\"keeper of the mountains and virgin of Nemi\\") is addressed by Horace as diva triformis (\\"three-form goddess\\").Horace, Carmine 3.22.1. Diana is commonly addressed as Trivia by Virgil and Catullus. The votive offerings, none earlier than the fourth century BC,Alföldi 1960::141 and bibliography. found in the grove of Aricia portray her as a huntress, and further as blessing men and women with offspring, and granting expectant mothers an easy delivery.Wissowa, Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft. The dedicatory inscription, long disappeared, was copied for its curiosity as testimony to the political union of Latin cities, the Latin leagueNow dated to the late sixth century. by Cato the Elder and transmitted, perhaps incompletely, by the grammarian Priscianus: > Lucum Dianium in nemore Aricino Egerius Baebius Tusculanus dedicavit > dictator Latinus. hi populi communiter: Tusculanus, Aricinus, Lanuvinus, > Laurens, Coranus, Tiburtis, Pometinus, Ardeatis Rutulus Diana Nemorensis was not translated to Republican Rome by the rite called evocatio, as was performed for Juno of Veii, but remained a foreigner there, in a temple outside the pomerium, apparently on the Aventine.The Arician origin of Diana of the Aventine is disputed in some ancient sources and by some modern commentators; for an Arician origin, see A. Alföldi, Early Rome and the Latins (1971:85ff). A votive inscription of the time of Nerva indicates that Vesta, Roman goddess of the hearth, home, and family, was also venerated in the grove at Nemi.C. Bennett Pascal demonstrated that Vesta was not synthesized with Diana Nemorensis, as had been assumed, in \\"Rex Nemorensis\\", Numen 23.1 (April 1976:23-39) p 28ff. The Golden Bough Legend has it that Diana's high priest at Nemi, known as the Rex Nemorensis, was always an escaped slave who could only obtain the position by defeating his predecessor in a fight to the death.Porteous, A. (2001). The Forest in Folklore and Mythology. Courier Corporation. , 9780486420103 Sir James George Frazer wrote of this sacred grove in The Golden Bough, basing his interpretation on brief remarks in Strabo (5.3.12), Pausanias (2,27.24) and Servius' commentary on the Aeneid (6.136). The legend tells of a tree that stood in the center of the grove and was heavily guarded. No one was allowed to break off its limbs, with the exception of a runaway slave, who was allowed, if he could, to break off one of the boughs. He was then in turn granted the privilege to engage the Rex Nemorensis, the current king and priest of Diana, in a fight to the death. If the slave prevailed, he became the next king for as long as he could defeat his challengers. However, Joseph Fontenrose criticised Frazer's assumption that a rite of this sort actually occurred at the sanctuary,Fontenrose, J. (1966). The Ritual Theory of Myth. University of California Press, ch. 3. and no contemporary records exist that support the historical existence of the Rex Nemorensis.Gordon, Arthur E., \\"On the Origin of Diana,\\" 186; and Encyclopedia Britannica, 1911, \\"Nemorensis Lacus,\\" 369, which cites Strabo, Pausanius, and Servius as the first sources for the rex N. legend.

She was particularly invested in the fight to desegregate Georgia's public schools between 1958 and 1961. Later, she became an advocate for those with mental illnesses.  Early life and education  Beverly Benson Long was the daughter of William Howard Benson and Charlotte Moor Benson of Athens, Georgia. She had one younger brother, Howard Edsel \\"Ed\\" Benson. Long's father founded Benson's Bakery in downtown Athens in 1918, two years before Long was born. In 1941, Long earned a Bachelor of Science from the University of Georgia. She then received a master's in public health from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1942 and a master's in psychology from the University of Georgia in 1959.  Civil rights advocacy  In 1954, the United States Supreme Court ruled on the case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas and declared that all public schools in the country must desegregate. To counter this ruling, Georgia passed several laws with the intent of preserving segregation throughout the state. These laws decreed that all Georgia public schools would close if any school integrated within the state. As an advocate for school integration, Beverly Long joined the organization Help Our Public Education Incorporated (HOPE Inc.). The purpose of HOPE Inc. was to disseminate factual information to Georgians regarding the potential closure of public schools and provide a course of action for concerned citizens who wished to keep the public school system operational. To appeal to the largest demographic of Georgians, the organization maintained a neutral stance on the issue of integration, but by advocating for the retention of the public school system HOPE Inc. implicitly supported desegregation. Other notable members of HOPE Inc. included former U.S. Attorney James Doresey, the former manager of the Atlanta chapter of the Red Cross Harry Boyte, and the former Georgia state president of the League of Women Voters Frances Pauley. While working with Hope Inc., Long assisted with a variety of outreach projects. In 1960, she presented a petition at the Georgia Capital with over 10,000 names that called for legislation to allow public schools to remain open. Long also worked with 986 of Georgia's leading businessmen to send a telegraph to the state government advocating for new laws. Long served as chair for the Athen's chapter of HOPE Inc. between 1958 and 1960. In 1960 she assumed the position of chair of the executive committee. She held this title until HOPE Inc. became inactive in 1961, after Georgia's segregation laws were revised to allow integration in public schools.  Mental health advocacy  Throughout her life, Long served on several committees and worked with numerous organizations committed to advocating for mental health awareness on local, national, and global levels. Within her home state of Georgia, Long served as the president of the National Mental Health Association of Atlanta between 1968 and 1969. She then took on the role of president of the National Mental Health Association of Georgia (now known as Mental Health America of Georgia) from 1973 to 1974. Between 1975 and 1978, Long served as the first chair of the Georgia Governor's Advisory Council on Mental Health, Mental Retardation, and Substance Abuse. In 1977 Long was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, who she met during his term as the 76th Governor of Georgia, to be a member of the President's Commission on Public Health, the first presidential commission formed to address issues of mental health policy. The commission was instrumental in formulating the National Plan for the Chronically Mentally Ill that influenced governmental policy regarding Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare. Between 1979 and 1980 Long served as President for the National Mental Health Association. In 1984, she founded and chaired the Commission on the Prevention of Mental-Emotional Disabilities within the National Mental Health Association. In 1987, Long helped to found the National Prevention Coalition, which she chaired until 1991. Between 1995 and 1997 Long served as the president of the World Federation for Mental Health. She also worked with the United Nations on issues related to mental health and was an active committee member of the Biennial Conference series produced by the Global Consortium for the Advancement of Promotion and Prevention. Long also helped to create the Rosalynn Carter Endowed Chair for Mental Health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University.  Honors and awards  In 2007, Long received an honorary Doctor of Science from Emory University in Atlanta, GA in recognition of her advocacy for mental health. She was nominated for this honor by former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, former Carter Center President and CEO John Hardman, and the Carter Center's Mental Health Program.  Personal life  Long married Maurice Wayne Long, an engineer and professor, in 1963. Together, they had two children, Anne Catherine Long Key and Elizabeth Long Rice. Long also had two children from a previous marriage, Theodore Douglas Downing and Beverly Patricia Downing.  References   External links  *Stuart A.

Biography He was born in 1892 in Vefa, Constantinople. His father Rifat Pasha was the Governor of Damascus. The first years of his childhood passed in Damascus. Then he came to Constantinople and went to Fatih İptidaisi (primary school). After graduating from primary school, he started to Kuleli Military High School, preferring to military service. In his first days in the lieutenant years he took part in the Albanian campaign. He was taken prisoner by the Bulgarians in the siege of Edirne. Bondage lasted two years. At the beginning of World War I, he was ordered by Cemal Pasha from Mersin. He came forward with his heroism in the Sinai and Palestinian fronts. Upon the conclusion of the First World War, Cemal Pasha from Mersin came to Konya. The establishment of the National Front had great benefits. He met with Sultan Mehmed VI as the first national representative. When Sultan Mehmed VI left his post, Damat Ferid Pasha had Atilhan arrested because of a conspiracy. He was imprisoned in the Bekir Ağa Bölgesi. During the Turkish War of Independence, he was appointed as the commander of Zonguldak-Bartin and Havalisi Fronts. It prevented the spread of the French Army in this region. Upon the victory of the War of Independence, he left the army and went into writing. Of his anti-semitic book \\"Suzy Liberman, Jewish Spy\\", in 1935 the Turkish Army gave the order to buy 40\`000 copies and distributed them amongst the officers. In 1942, he was arrested by the government of the time on the grounds that the coup was being prepared. He was incarcerated for 11 months. In 1952, he was arrested again in Malatya as responsible for the assassination attempt of Ahmet Emin Yalman. He was detained for 11 months and 15 days. He wrote 74 works and thousands of articles. He was influenced by antisemitic politicians like Şerif Yaçağaz and Ali Galip Yenen. Because of his antisemitic writings, he was described as the 'Hitler of the Middle East'. In August 1964 he was invited to congress of Islamic States in Somalia. He was elected as the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Congress. This post was his last major mission.

He completed a cartoon for the work in 1793 which was favourably received by art critics active in Rome at the time.

Often a lynching postcard would be inscribed with racist text or poems. Lynching postcards were in widespread production for more than fifty years in the United States; although their distribution through the United States Postal Service was banned in 1908.  Description  Terror lynchings as a display of racial domination peaked around the 1880s through to the 1940s, and were less frequent until the 1970s, especially (but not exclusively) in the Southern United States. Lynchings were widely used to intimidate recently emancipated African Americans after the Civil War Reconstruction era, and were later used to intimidate voters and civil rights workers of all ethnic backgrounds. Mostly African-American men, women, and children were lynched, for a lack of subservience or for success in business. Others were often accused of crimes and forcibly removed from their homes or jails to be killed by a white supremacist mob without due process or presumption of innocence. Spectators sold one another souvenirs including postcards. Often the photographer was one of the killers. In a typical lynching postcard, the victim is displayed prominently at the center of the shot, while smiling spectators, often including children, crowd the margins of the frame, posing for the camera to prove their presence. Facial expressions suggesting remorse, guilt, shame, or regret are rare.  Cultural significance  Some purchasers used lynching postcards as ordinary postcards, communicating unrelated events to friend and relatives. Others resold lynching postcards at a profit. Still others collected them as historical objects or racist paraphernalia: their manufacture and continued distribution was part of white supremacist culture, and has been likened to \\"bigot pornography\\". Whatever their use, the cultural message embodied in most lynching postcards was one of racial superiority. > \\"Within specific localities, viewers did not disconnect the photographs from > the actual lynchings they represented. Through that particularity, the > images served as visual proof for the uncontested 'truth' of white civilized > morality over and against supposed black bestiality and savagery.\\" Viewed from an outsider's perspective, bereft of local context, the postcards symbolized white power more generally. White citizens were depicted as victorious over powerless dead black victims, and the pictures became part of secular iconography. Richard Lacayo, writing for Time magazine, noted in 2000, > Even the Nazis did not stoop to selling souvenirs of Auschwitz, but lynching > scenes became a burgeoning subdepartment of the postcard industry. By 1908, > the trade had grown so large, and the practice of sending postcards > featuring the victims of mob murderers had become so repugnant, that the > U.S. Postmaster General banned the cards from the mails. As late as the 21st century, James Allen was able to acquire a collection of lynching postcards from dealers who offered them in whispered tones and clandestine marketplaces.  Legality  Some towns had censored lynching photographs earlier in the 20th century, but the first step toward nationwide censorship came in 1908. The 1873 Comstock Act had forbidden the publication of \\"obscene matter as well as its circulation in the mails\\". In 1908, §3893 was added to the Comstock Act, extending the ban to material \\"tending to incite arson, murder, or assassination\\". Although this act did not explicitly ban lynching postcards themselves, it banned the racist text that often accompanied them, which made \\"too explicit what was always implicit in lynchings\\". Despite the amendment, the distribution of lynching photographs and postcards continued, now concealed within envelopes or mail wrappers..  See also  *Lynching of Laura and L. D.

It has a circulation of 1,050 weekly paid readers. The paper is a member of the Soledad Chamber of Commerce The owner of the Soledad Bee is California publisher New SV Media. The current editor is Ryan Cronk.  History  The Soledad Bee was established 1909 by Chester G. Kinnear. It was first mentioned in the Santa Cruz Evening News on October 20, 1909. In 1911, Kinnear was sued for libel for placing an advertisement against Maxwell Browne, who was a candidate for District Attorney at the time. Kinnear had already sold the paper to C. J. Giacomazzi by this point, but he was staying with the paper to help prepare Giacomazzi to run the paper. In 1919, C. J. Giacomazzi returned from serving in the American Expeditionary Forces in France. In 1967, Harry Casey, who also owned the Greenfield News and Gonzales Tribune, acquired the Soledad Bee. All of Casey's newspapers were printed in The King City Rustler plant. In 1981 Publisher Harry Casey, supported by the California Newspaper Publishers Association, insists that newspapers have the right to view police investigation reports. As a result, the California Newspaper Publishers Association talked to state legislators about changing the law to require the basic reporting of crimes. Casey continued to cover issues with the Soledad police department, especially as a grand jury investigated the department. The mayor, in response to the Bee's coverage, angrily complained that the Bee was \\"going out and digging up stuff\\" about the police department. The Soledad Bee and associated weekly papers were sold to News Media Corporation in 1995.On July 1, 2019, New SV Media purchased the Bee along with three newspapers in the Salinas Valley area and the Watsonville Register-Pajaronian.

During the day, this wētā hides in burrows in the soil and is active only at night (they are nocturnal). The species is found in native forests in North and South Island. Females of this species have medium- long curved ovipositers to lay their eggs in the soil. Unlike some Hemiandrus species, H. nox does not show maternal care.  Taxonomy  Hemiandrus nox was first described in 2016, but had been referred to in previous publications by an informal (tag) name (Hemiandrus 'alius'). The species name comes from Nox, the Roman goddess of the night.  Habitat/distribution  Hemiandrus nox are endemic to the North and South Island of New Zealand, but restricted to mature native forest. This species is most abundant in North-west Nelson. They are a nocturnal species and found in burrows in the ground during the day. Hemiandrus nox is sympatric with three other Hemiandrus species and is host to the intracellular bacteria Wollbachia.  Conservation  The New Zealand Department of Conservation classified this species as not threatened  Diet  Hemiandrus nox is probably omnivorous, but has only been observed eating invertebrates such as cicada  Morphology  This species is very similar in appearance to the three species within the Hemiandrus maculifrons-complex. Adult females have a medium-long length, strongly curved ovipositor with dark patches at its base. The head and body of adults are small and dark brown with a cream and brown clypeus; sometimes with small pale patches on the pronotum. The three apical segments of the maxillary palps have fine microsetae. The spines on their legs can be used to distinguish them from sympatric species: their mid tibiae has three spines along the inferior retrolateral angle (excluding apical spine), and their hind tibiae has no inferior articulated spines. In addition male teminalia are unique.

The two figures to the left are Peter Martyr and a donor or the infant John the Baptist. Its date is inscribed on the reverse as \\"1503 adì 20 septembris\\" and - although it is not in Lotto's handwriting as seen in documents - it is a 16th century hand and therefore accepted. It was probably commissioned by bishop Bernardo de' Rossi. Art historians theorise that it was an ex voto for escaping a murder attempt planned for 29 September 1503. It was probably brought to Parma by Rossi when he fled there in 1524 and later entered the Farnese collection, in whose inventories it first appeared in 1650.

Overview According to Human Rights Encyclopedia the Ukrainian government does a poor job to protect human rights of a local population. For example, Ukrainian police well-known for its brutality against arrested and detained citizens which often constitutes acts of torture. Ukrainian detention facilities are overcrowded and poorly maintained. The most part of the prison's infrastructure do not meet international standards and became reservoirs for infectious diseases (tuberculosis and HIV). Amnesty International reported that the climate of torture in the Ukrainian prisons fostered by impunity of security officers who use the torture to extract confessions completely ignoring presumption of innocence. Ukraine signed the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture on 2 May 1996 and ratified it on 5 May 1997. The convention came into effect on 1 September 1997, but the cooperation of Ukraine with European Committee for the Prevention of Torture always used to be a persistent problem. On many occasions the European Committee was not provided with a required documents and its recommendations were not implemented by the Ukrainian side. In the same time there were multiple concerns and allegations of ill-treatment of detainees by Ukrainian law enforcement agencies. Some experts emphasize that conditions in Ukraine's police custody have never been good and there were no visible improvements since collapse of the Soviet Union. In addition to this, the investigations of police brutality became de facto impossible and the only administrative body for police oversight was closed. Interestingly, Belarus and the Ukraine are the only European nations that have not implemented the independent torture prevention system OPCAT (Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture). Practices of torture Regarding this issue British expert Taras Kuzio pointed out that the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs won a notorious reputation worst of any other security force in Ukraine. Mistreatment of citizens, their torture and abuses of rights are common and a little has changed since the Soviet times in the methods of policing. In April 2010 the Council of Europe reviewed around 6,000 complaints about torture of which the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies only examined 200 cases and all these decisions were biased in favor of torturers. As a result the Council of Europe condemned the lack of investigations, related to police torture in Ukraine stating \\"Few police officers are ever called to account for their unlawful behavior; even fewer are ever convicted.\\" In 2017 Amnesty International reported that during the War in Donbass there were overwhelming evidences of ongoing war crimes, including torture and mass murders of prisoners.Breaking Bodies: Torture and Summary Killings in Eastern Ukraine Amnesty International, 2017 Particularly, in Eastern Ukraine Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) operates special hidden prisons for alleged Donbass rebels where unacknowledged detention is accompanied by widespread torture and different kinds of human rights abuses. Ukrainian government tried to deny the existence of the blacksites, but it was confirmed by multiple reports of UN monitoring mission in Ukraine, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.“You Don’t Exist” Arbitrary Detentions, Enforced Disappearances, and Torture in Eastern Ukraine Amnesty InternationalWatchdogs: Civilians Detained, Tortured in Eastern UkraineKiev allows torture and runs secret jails, says UN The Times Dutch journalist Chris Kaspar de Ploeg in his book \\"Ukraine in the Crossfire\\" said about the prisons that their \\"practices happen completely in the dark\\" emphasizing that the supporting evidence about the facilities has been documented independently by the UN, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. In 2018 Amnesty International concluded that \\"The investigation into the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) for its alleged secret prisons failed to make any progress. Law enforcement officials continued to use torture and other ill-treatment\\".Ukraine 2017/2018 Amnesty International, 2018 Ukrainian volunteer battalion \\"Tornado\\" became another infamous example of a mass torture and sadistic practices used by Ukrainian paramilitary forces. According to Der Spiegel the prisoners captured by \\"Tornado\\" were held in basement, stripped totally naked, placed on a concrete wall, doused with water and tortured by applying electricity to testicles, genitals and other body parts. Also some prisoners were forced to rape each other under threat of death. According to what has been videotaped by the officers of the \\"Tornado\\" there were a local civilians among their victims including women. The investigation revealed that the commander of \\"Tornado\\" had several prior criminal convictions, but for his political supporters it wasn't a reason to worry about. The absence of war crimes charges (including rape, murder, cruel treatment, sexual violence) remains as another unexplained question. The similar pattern has been documented in other investigated cases of Ukrainian atrosities. It is highly likely that the volunteer battalions are responsible for the most of the war crimes committed by the Ukrainian forces. The personnel of the units dominated by neonazi was reported by international and local organizations in connection with abductions, ill-treatment, unlawful detentions, property thefts and other kinds of offenses. Despite of the exceptionally serious nature of the crime activities, the Ukrainian civil society prefers to ignore them in public discussions. In the connection to the settled tendency Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union reminds that the torture is strictly prohibited by international humanitarian law and no circumstances may be used to justify it.

It draws on the pyramidical compositions of Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael and takes its name from the domestic cat in the foreground, which allows it to be identified with a work known as \\"il quadro della gatta\\" (the painting of or with the cat) by Vasari, who saw it in Mantua in 1566. The same cat recurs in the artist's 1524-1525 The Lovers. The work was probably produced for Federico Gonzaga while the artist was still in Rome and thus formed part of the Gonzaga collection for a time. In the late 16th century it is recorded in the collection of Barbara Sanseverino, a noblewoman from Parma and lover and confidant of Vincenzo I Gonzaga. The Farnese family confiscated artworks from several local nobles and thus the work entered the Farnese collection from Sanseverino's collection in 1612. It was one of the works inherited by Charles of Bourbon around 1737 and was then moved to Naples, where it remains.

The bus massacre was the worst terrorist incident in Punjab of the year 1986. It occurred on Sunday, 30 November 1986, near Khuda located in the Hoshiarpur district in the northern state of Punjab, India close to the Indo-Pak border. According to the local police officials four Sikh terrorists carrying automatic weapons (AK-47) and revolvers hijacked the public bus, taking it to a remote area and stopped. The terrorists then commanded all Hindu passengers to get off the bus. While the passengers were getting down, the terrorists opened fire on them killing twenty four of them and injuring seven with gunshots. The gunmen then fled the location after the killings in motorcycles and scooters. Objective The goal of the terrorists behind the massacre was to drive out the million Hindus living in the Punjab state and force the Sikhs living in the other states of India to move in. This would have enabled the Sikh separatists to claim the Punjab state as a sovereign country of Khalistan. Thousands of refugees belonging to the Hindu religion from Punjab had already moved to New Delhi to escape the communal violence. In July same year, after a similar incident of the killing of 15 people in Muktsar in July, Hindu-Sikh riots had broke out in western part of New Delhi, where a majority of Hindu refugees from Punjab lived. Five people were killed in those Riots. The Police in New Delhi were put on increased vigilance with more patrolling to prevent a similar rioting that had happened in July.

The ministry's headquarters are at Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang. The current minister is Kim Yong-jae and the vice minister O Ryong-chol. The ministry was established in 2014 when its predecessor, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, fused with the Joint Venture Investment Committee the State Economic Development Commission to revive the ministry that had been marred by economic sanctions against North Korea. History Portrait of Karl Marx was on the facade of the ministry until 2012. The Ministry of Foreign Trade was newly established in September 1998 following the adoption of the new 1998 \\"Kim Il- sung Constitution\\". It initially oversaw all international economic activities. Some of its tasks were delegated to two organizations founded in 2010 and 2013, respectively: The Joint Venture Investment Committee (JVIC) was established to handle foreign investment and the State Economic Development Commission (SEDC) to manage the Special Economic Zones of North Korea. Gradually, because of sanctions against North Korea, the Foreign Trade Ministry became inoperable. Between 2008 and 2016 Ri Ryong-nam served as the minister. In 2012, prominent portraits of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin were removed from the facade of the ministry on Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang, which observers took for indirect signs of change brought about by the leadership of Kim Jong-un. The present ministry was created on 8 June 2014 when the Ministry of Foreign Trade fused with the JVIC, and SEDC. All three constituent organizations had been affiliates in the Cabinet of North Korea. It is likely that they had much overlap in their tasks. According to the Institute for Far Eastern Studies: \\"the creation of this new Cabinet- affiliated ministry can be interpreted as an attempt to reach a breakthrough in North Korea's stagnating international economic cooperation ... a measure taken to increase the efficiency of decision-making and implementation of foreign trade-related issues, and to put an end to the confusion and inefficient inter-competition that arose out of the creation of these additional agencies\\". Alt URL The ministry opened a website in October 2018. According to Martyn Wililams of North Korea Tech, the website came \\"at an interesting time as Kim Jong Un has pegged economic development as a major goal for the country, as South Korean companies are weighing projects that could help relations between the two Koreas but as the international community has some of the strictest sanctions ever on the country\\".

IWRG has held their Castillo del Terror show since 2005, usually late in the year. As with the majority of the IWRG shows it took place at Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, the home of IWRG. The main event was the eponymous Castillo del Terror Steel cage match where the last person eliminated would be forced to unmasked per the Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", stipulation. The third, fifth and sixth match was later shown on IWRG's weekly show on the Mexican AYM Sports network. The main event was the eponymous Castillo del Terror Steel cage match where the last person eliminated would be forced to unmasked per the match stipulation. As a result of badly timed dive off the top of the cage Zatura was the last man in the cage and was forced to unmask. Due to several people leaving the cage at approximately the same time no one was officially given \\"credit\\" for the win although Emperador Azteca was visually the last to leave the cage. After the match Zatura unmasked and revealed his real name; Hector Neri. On the undercard Los Tortuga Ninjas (\\"The Ninja Turtles\\"; Leo, Mike and Rafy) (C) successfully defended the Distrito Federal Trios Championship against Los Infierno Rockers (Devil Rocker Machine Rocker and Soul Rocker) Background Starting as far back as at least 2002, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. From 2005 IWRG has promoted a fall show, around the Mexican Day of the Death, under the name El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\"), to distinguish it from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG Guerra del Golfo (\\"Gulf War\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\"), or IWRG Prisión Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The Castillo del Terror shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2018 Castillo del Terror show will be the 14th year in a row that IWRG has promoted a show under that name. Event The El Castillo del Terror event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed themselves as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in wrestling matches. For the fifth match of the night Trauma I was originally supposed to team with Sharlie Rockstar and El Hijo de Dos Caras, but for unexplained reasons they were replaced by Bobby Lee Jr. and Devil Rocker. Due to the substitution both Bobby Lee Jr. and Devil Rocker worked twice that night. The makeshift trio was not able to work together well enough to defeat the rudo team of Canis Lupus, Mr. Electro and Máscara Año 2000 Jr. who won the match. After the match ended both Mr. Electro and Canis Lupus made challenges to Trauma I to defend the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship against either of them. For the steel cage match main event all ten wrestlers were forced to remain in the cage for ten minutes before they would be allowed to try to escape the cage and thus save their mask. During the early portion of the match a couple of wrestlers attempted to climb the cage, but were quickly reminded of the rules. Early on a couple of wrestlers began to pair off, especially Imposible and Emperador Azteca, who fought throughout the match. At one point Imposible pulled Emperador Azteca's mask off, which would be a disqualification during a regular match, but not in the Castillo del Terror. Moments later Emperador Azteca returned the favor and pulled Imposible's mask off, then put Imposible's mask on himself to cover his face. Moments later Imposible put on Azteca's mask, with both wrestlers finishing the match wearing the other's mask. After the ten minutes were up several wrestlers tried to climb the cage, but each time their efforts were halted by the other wrestlers in the cage. At one point Zatura was able to break away from the cage and climbed to the top without anyone stopping him. Once on the top of the cage Zatura decided to not leave the cage, instead he leapt off the top of the 15 foot tall cage, landing on the remaining nine wrestlers. After he landed Zatura began clutching his knee, indicating that he hurt himself during the dive. After some confusion among the remaining competitors, they all took advantage of the situation and decided to climb out of the cage to keep their masks safe. None of the competitors fought as they climbed up, leaving Zatura on the mat. The remaining nine wrestlers all left the cage around the same time, with Emperador Azteca being the last person to climb over and down to the floor. Due to the nature of the finish no official winner was announced for the 2016 Castillo del Terror match. As a result of the loss Zatura, while being strapped to a gurney, had to remove his mask and per lucha libre traditions had to reveal his real name. Zatura announced that his name was Hector Neri, that he was 30 years old and had been wrestling for 8 years at that point.

It is mentioned in an inventory of the goods of Barbara Sanseverino dated 27 April 1596 as \\"a painting by Correggio, called the Marriage of Saint Catherine, small but rejoicing in extreme beauty\\". Sanseverino offered it as a gift to Vincenzo I Gonzaga, who had a particular interest in works by Correggio, but the work did not reach Mantua. Instead it was requested by Odoardo Farnese in Rome - Correggio's reputation was then at its peak thanks to the popularity of the Carracci brothers and their school. The work may have been the painting seen in the Palazzo del Giardino by Scannelli and described by him in 1657 in his Microcosmo or alternatively a small painting of the subject recorded in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome in 1644. In either case, a copy of the painting definitely stayed in Rome and belonged to Lelio Guidiccioni, a man of letters. Giovan Battista Mercati produced a print of it and dedicated it to Guidiccioni - this print is more faithful to the original than the earlier print by Giorgio Ghisi. A copy of the painting is now in the Hermitage Museum and - according to an engraving of it by Moette - it has an inscription on the back reading “Laus Deo, per Donna Mathilda d'Este Antonio Lieto da Correggio fece il presente quadretto per sua divozione.

It is a non-profit association constituted on September 14, 1922 in Buenos Aires. Before its creation the Polo Association of the River Plate (the P.A.R.P) was the governing body for polo in Argentina. However in 1921, a group of players formed the Argentine Polo Federation with the intent on sending teams abroad to compete internationally, an idea opposed by the P.A.R.P. When the teams sent to England and the United States by the Argentine Polo Federation were successful, it appeared that clubs and players would defect from the P.A.R.P. to join the Federation. The P.A.R.P. agreed to negotiations in 1922. The negotiations took place between Francisco Ceballos and Miguel Martinzes de Hoz of the Argentine Polo Federation and Ernest Jewell and Joseph Monroe Hinds of the P.A.R.P. Finally at a meeting at the Hurlingham Club on September 14, 1922, twenty-seven club delegates signed the founding document of the AAP. The first President was Joseph Monroe Hinds, and first Vice-President was Francisco Ceballos. The association is headquartered in Buenos Aires and is headed by the Board of Directors, which is made up of a president, a vice president and thirteen directors. The current president is Eduardo Novillo Astrada (h). Several subcommissions are configured to fulfill the tasks. The AAP organizes the most important polo tournament in the world, the Campeonato Argentino Abierto de Polo, which is played in the Campo Argentino de Polo in Buenos Aires. The AAP also oversees the remaining polo tournaments in Argentina, establishes the rules for polo in Argentina and is responsible for interpretation in case of doubt, imposes disciplinary measures and decides on the handicap of players active in Argentina.

It occurred on 25 July 1986, when a bus was attacked by Sikh militants in which 15 people were shot dead in Muktsar in the northern state of Punjab, India. Los Angeles Times reported that three men had boarded an express bus going from Muktsar, located in the erstwhile Faridkot district in the western Punjab to its destination Chandigarh. After travelling for approximately 10 miles after Muktsar, at a railway crossing the bus stopped and a fourth person boarded it. The four men started waving their weapons which included pistols and Sten guns, and ordered the ladies, children and people of the Sikh religion, who were profiled by their identification symbols turbans and long beards, to get down from the bus. The four men started shooting the remaining Hindu passengers still on the bus. It was reported that the passengers who were killed were all men belonging to the Hindu religion except one man, who was a Sikh with shaved beard. The number of injured passengers was seven. One of the injured man named Surjit Singh was another Sikh in the bus with shaved beard. Surjit was shot in the head and lost his vision but survived. His wife reportedly pleaded with the terrorists to spare them since they were Jat Sikhs as well, but she was ignored. The separation of the passengers on religious grounds and the subsequent massacre of 14 Hindus, suggested that the massacre was a part of Sikh separatist Khalistan movement's campaign designed to divide the communities of Sikh and the Hindus. In bus attack was a major terrorist incident in Punjab during the year 1986, worst being the 1986 Hoshiarpur Bus massacre. Los Angeles Times called the massacre as \\"one of the worst against the Hindu community during the more than five years\\" since that the Sikh separatist Khalistan movement had become active in Punjab. The state of Punjab had a Sikh population of 9 million and Hindu population of 7 million. Objective The goal of the terrorists behind the massacre was to drive out the seven million Hindus living in the state of Punjab and force the Sikhs living outside of the Punjab state to move in. This would have enabled the Sikh separatists to claim the Punjab state as a sovereign country of Khalistan. Districts near the Indo-Pak border like Faridkot had the most intense campaign carried out by Khalistani terrorists to intimidate the local Hindus and had resulted in their mass exodus. Several thousand Hindu refugees from Punjab had already moved to New Delhi to escape the communal violence. The India-Pakistan diplomatic relationship has come under strain due to the allegations from Indian diplomats about Pakistani intelligence agents supporting the Khalistani terrorists. Aftermath The police in Faridkot district had placed the district on curfew. After the incident of the killing of 15 people in Muktsar in July, Hindu-Sikh riots had broke out in western part of New Delhi, where a majority of Hindu refugees from Punjab lived. Five people were killed in those Riots. Reactions The terrorist attack was raised in the Parliament of India where it was condemned. The Punjab state government which consisted of moderate Sikhs also spoke against the incident. The five major political parties in Punjab state had called for businesses to remain closed in protest of the massacre. The Punjab state government, convened an emergency meeting in Chandigarh and made an appeal to the citizens to \\"remain calm in the face of grave provocation and not to fall into the trap laid by anti-social elements wanting to throw the state into fratricidal bloodshed.\\"  See also  *1991 Punjab killings  References  Mass murder in 1986 Mass shootings in India Insurgency in Punjab Punjab Killings, 1986 Terrorism in Punjab, India Punjab Killings, 1986 Terrorist incidents on buses in Asia Sikh terrorism in India Khalistan movement 1986 mass shootings 1980s mass shootings in Asia 1980s murders in India 1986 crimes in India Massacres of men Violence against men in Asia ","title":"1986 Muktsar bus massacre"},{"id":"58792395","text":"Władysław Cieszyński (Kolonia Bryńska or Długa Wieś, 28 October 1891 – 17 November 1939, Piaśnica) was a Polish journalist, social activist and promoter of Polish culture.

Olancha, California is located in the Inyo County, on route 395 with an elevation of 1,115m. Olancha has had a total of 5334 earthquakes since 1931, the largest occurring in 1998 with a magnitude of 5.2. Owens Valley, is located northeast of Olancha consisting mostly of dry, arid saline lakebed. October the 3rd 2009 at 01:16 UTC marked the first earthquake of the “triple shock” to come, matching the high magnitude of the 1998 earthquake. Over a 48 hour period three earthquakes, considered to be of “moderate size” took place in the Owens Valley, in-between Olancha and Keeler. The three shocks had magnitudes of 5.2, 5.0 and 4.9 respectively, accompanied by smaller earthquakes between each. The Olancha earthquake Sequence initiated local liquefaction, within a 1.2 km area in Owens Valley. This resulted in ‘horizontal ground deformation’, still present in the current landscape. Geology Plate Tectonic movement of San Andreas Fault.  Tectonic Setting  California is made from twelve varying geomorphic provinces. East of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range lays Owens Valley, the long depression town of population 192. This composition of California gives it unique topography, inclusive of the highest and lowest points of the United States, Mount Whitney and Death Valley. The San Andreas Fault is a transform boundary, which lies between the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate and extends 1200 km. A transform boundary in the lithosphere means that two plates create a ‘fracture zone’ and rub against one another, causing stress and resulting in an earthquake. California is located above the San Andreas Fault, and causes the majority of Californian Earthquakes, inclusive of the Olancha Earthquake Series in 2009. Owens Valley (Eastern California) includes both boundaries from the Sierra Nevada Region and the Great Basin, hence becoming susceptible to liquefaction and plate movement. The Sierra Nevada region particularly, allows for the plate to lift oceanic crust resulting in large salt masses and moist air pockets, generating further instability in the region. There are many theories about the origin of the structural landscape of the Owen Valley, a widely reported, and evidence-based one being that the tectonic setting is due to “volcanic-tectonic depressions” Geographical studies have describes Olancha as lying on “the backbone of California”, and is therefore at high risk of natural disasters occurring.  Sequence of Events  The Olancha Earthquake series had epicentres southeast of the small town of Lone Pine, past the eastern rise of Sierra Nevada, approximately 290 km north of Los Angeles. The first of the shocks, with magnitude of 5.2 occurred at 6:15 pm at a moderately shallow penetration. Two small aftershocks followed this main tremor of magnitudes 4.7 and 4.9 all within a six-minute time period, according to the US Geological survey. Anthony Guarino, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology described the sequence of events as, “a very robust sequence, with more intense shaking felt over a wider area and maybe even physical cracks in the ground”, this is largely due to the shallow depth of the shock. Californian earthquakes are between six and ten miles deep so are thus less impactful on the earth’s surface. At approximately 3 o’clock am on the following Thursday the second major earthquake struck with a magnitude of 5, proficient of causing moderate damage to surrounding areas. At least a dozen aftershocks were felt, of extremely small magnitudes, most likely on a “strike-slip fault”. A strike-slip fault is a vertical (or mostly vertical) fracture where large blocks of the earth's crust have mostly moved horizontally, either to the left (left lateral) or to the right (right lateral). Effects  Liquefaction Horizontal ground deformation lateral left shift in the surface of the earth. Seismically induced liquefaction during the Olancha Earthquake series in 2009 was the dominating effect on the surrounding landscape. . Liquefaction acts in accordance with fluid dynamics, thus turning solid matter into liquid due to surrounding environmental factors. For example sand boiling, ground cracking and lateral spread. Leading scientists and architects have invested their time in creating surfaces, which counteract and/or are non-liquefiable. These mitigation methods have been devised by engineers and involve soil being compacted down through vibro compaction, small vibrations under the earth's surface shake the affected area slightly allowing for the loose, uncompacted sand and soil fragments to become dense. The primary factors contributing to the land liquefaction was due to the Tectonic setting, and extreme climates that California demonstrates. Further, liquefaction is often most common in saturated, low density/ uncompacted sandy soils. The Earthquake that caused the widespread liquefaction from the series, was the first shock, of magnitude 5.2, which was unusual for liquefaction to occur at this magnitude, as scientists hypothesised using the “Seed-Idriss Procedure”. The loss of stiffness and strength in soils and sand creates damage to the foundations of buildings and infrastructure during an earthquake. Shallow liquefaction is the most destructive, alongside a 5.2 magnitude earthquake. The depth of the Olancha Earthquake Series (2009) Liquefaction was approximately 3m in depth causing the surface of the land to change its physical composition and remain in this formation to this current day. The effects of liquefaction on the man- made environment can be highly destructive. In the case of the Olancha Earthquake Sequence natural landscapes surrounded the epicentre with minimal damages to man-made structures, due to the barren surroundings.  Horizontal ground deformation  Widespread horizontal ground deformation is a result of large 'Peak Ground Accelerations' (PGA's). A PGA is equal to the largest shift between plates in any given earthquake, and is usually larger than a vertical shift, creating more damage. Widespread horizontal ground deformation was a contributing factor in the 1975 Earthquake in Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, resulting in an extreme 8-metre shift horizontally and 3.5 metres vertically. The scientific connection between the Kilauea Volcanic Earthquake and the Olancha Earthquake sequence stems from movements many kilometres away from the epicentre - where the earthquake is initiated. In Hawaii the magnitude 7.2 earthquake was felt approximately 30 km away west from the epicentre, down the south coast, due to the major 8-metre ground shift taking place. Research/ reconstruction The small population (192) in Olancha meant that the Earthquake of highest magnitude on October 3 did not cause any deaths or damage to the sparse surrounding landscape. The continuity of the surface in Owens Valley allowed for the earthquake shock to travel and evidently be felt in Merced, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The arid landscape has become a place for research, such as scientist and geologists instigating what caused the high level of liquefaction, when it is usually not caused by earthquakes with a magnitude less than 6. In the article ‘Engineering Geology’, a conclusion as too why liquefaction was cause in the Olancha earthquake series is derived, “Liquefaction during small magnitude earthquakes presumably depends on the presence of either or both very susceptible soil and anomalously high ground motion”. The use of paleoliquefaction, alongside experimental design such as the “Seed-Idriss Procedure” in the Owen Valley Region, California has provided scientists as to why the liquefaction occurred at a 5.2 magnitude.  Seismic profiles  Seismograph, Solid frame attached to a solid part of earth's mantle, inertia initiating movement Seismic equipment is used to determine ground motion, displaying these movements on a seismograph. This specific measuring tool can be placed temporarily in order to answer a scientific question and to spark geological interest, they can also be installed permanently in order to investigate the complete structure of the earth's interior. The way a seismograph is attached, is to a large piece of the crust through a frame, allows for the frame to freely move as the earth moves, with the heavy electronics attached to the frame staying in the same position, this is due to its inertia. Thus the comparative motion between the frame and the heavy electronics inside the frame measures the ground motion. In the Owens Valley and Long Valley region five specific seismic devices were read during and after the triple shock sequence. The devices were placed in varying locations and depths between Owens Valley, Olancha and Lone Pine to allow for accurate analysis of the five varying profiles. Seismic profile 1 was measured in a shallow area of the barren landscape and resulted in relatively thin soil and sand, as a result from horizontal ground deformation, leading to an area highly susceptible to seismic liquefaction. The second seismic profile was measured along a 42,000-foot line and suggested that the sand and pre-tertiary bedrock is thousands of metres deep at one end of the Owens Valley and much more shallow at the opposite end, demonstrating the unequal distribution of sand/soil density in the region. Profile number three was measured along a road running east just south of Lone Pine. This road was measured by Gianella of the University of Nevada to have shifted approximately 4.8 metres in the left lateral (horizontal) direction since the large earthquake that struck in 1872. Profile number four indicated apparent dips within the mantle, demonstrating both dense areas of land and sparse areas. Profile number five was run along a road approximately 4 kilometres south of Bishop, a small town located at an elevation of 4150 feet in the Inyo county, the seismograph indicating further uncertainty due to different density readings. This uneven distribution is due to California’s geography, particularly aligning with the San Andreas Fault. For researchers and scientists, it is therefore hard to hypothesis and determines large-scale movements that will occur from earthquakes in the future.  Associated earthquakes  Lone Pine grave from the magnitude 7.4 to 7.9 earthquake in 1872, killing 27 people and injuring 56. California is highly susceptible to earthquakes, due to its geographical position, particularly as the region resides on the Pacific and North American plates. Large blocks of land shift causing stress on the surrounding land and resulting in a range from low to high magnitude shocks. On the 26th of March in 1872, Owens Valley experienced an earthquake of magnitude 7.2. Scientists have recorded this earthquake to be the \\"largest historical earthquake in California\\". According to the 1918 issue of The Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America (BSSA), on July 17, 1918, \\"a distinct earthquake shock was felt twelve miles southeast of Olancha, Inyo County ... No damage was done\\". Lucile Jones, a seismologist who has conducted research on the Owens Valley region, stated in a 1995 LA Times article that \\"Clusters of earthquakes in Rivercrest and the nearby Owens Valley are common\\" and that she expected that the ongoing Ridgecrest earthquake sequence would result in aftershocks in the high 4 magnitude range. Connections between earthquake-prone areas and their history of high magnitude shocks have contributed to the latter liquefaction present in the Olancha earthquake sequence in 2009 also assisting with scientific research. In 1872 an earthquake of magnitude 7.4 to 7.9 occurred in Lone Pine, which is located 37 kilometres north of Olancha. The 1872 Lone Pine earthquake also demonstrated horizontal ground deformation, eventuating to a 350,000 m2 graben which eventually was filled with water and named the Diaz Lake. Alongside the ground deformation 27 people were killed and 56 people were injured.

He was convicted of depriving civil rights through murder by conspiring with an assassin to kill a local resident. Police career Davis was known in the community as \\"Robocop\\" due to his large size and the \\"Desire terrorist\\" due to his aggressive policing style. He had a reputation as both a good and bad cop. He had been suspended six times and received 20 complaints between 1987 and 1992 while subsequently receiving the department's Medal of Merit in 1993. Due to significant corruption within the New Orleans police department, the FBI had set up a sting in 1994, catching Davis in a cocaine protection operation. Davis had come to the attention of federal investigators for extorting bribes and offering protection to a drug dealer who was a federal informant. Nine other police officers, including two who would later testify against Davis, were indicted in the cocaine operation. Twenty additional officers were implicated in the scheme but the investigation had to be aborted with the murder of Kim Groves. Davis would later be convicted of additional drug- related charges while the other officers pleaded guilty.  Murder of Kim Groves  In 1994, Davis beat a young man in New Orleans, mistaking him for a suspect in a police officer's shooting. Kim Groves, a 32-year old local resident and mother of three young children, witnessed the assault and filed a complaint with the New Orleans police department. Davis conspired with a local drug dealer, Paul Hardy, to retaliate. Hardy shot and killed her on October 14, 1994, less than one day after she filed the complaint. A third man, Damon Causey, hid the murder weapon, a 9 mm pistol. Trial and conviction Davis was convicted in 1996 on two federal civil rights charges for directing Hardy to murder Groves and for witness tampering. Davis was initially sentenced to death on April 26, 1996. The 5th Circuit, however, reversed his death sentence when his conviction for witness tampering was thrown out. A subsequent jury also chose the death penalty for Davis, and he was formally sentenced to death again on October 27, 2005. Davis is currently on federal death row and is imprisoned in United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana. Hardy was convicted of conspiracy to violate Groves' civil rights and of witness tampering. The witness tampering conviction would be later overturned. He was initially sentenced to death, but in 2011 his sentence was commuted to life when he was found by a judge to be mentally retarded. Causey was convicted of federal conspiracy charges and violating Groves' civil rights. He was sentenced to life imprisonment after rejecting a plea bargain that instead would have sentenced him to prison for six to nine years. His conviction was upheld on appeal. Aftermath and later developments In 2018, the city of New Orleans settled a lawsuit with Groves' three children in the sum of $1.5 million.

Portland's black population, which numbered fewer than 800 on the paper's launch date, were highly literate in comparison to southern blacks of the time, and to Oregon's white laboring class.

The Oregon Historical Society holds about 400 issues of the New Age, and the University of Oregon and Harvard University have issues on microfilm. Prior to launching the New Age, Griffin had been editor of the Northwest Echo in Spokane, Washington. He left Portland for unknown reasons in 1907, and the newspaper did not survive his departure.

Along with suggesting that a collaborative project between Migos and Drake would be released due to their touring together, after a question on when new Migos music would arrive, he replied: \\"We'll be at the top of 2019.

Two slightly different models, the Medici I and the Medici II were produced in 1974 and 1976. The design was led by Giorgetto Giugiaro. The Medici's design had an influence on numerous other production vehicles in the 1970s. The Medici was named after the Florentine family of the same name, renowned for their power and patronage of the arts during the Renaissance.  Concept  The Maserati Medici was a design study for a luxury sports sedan. Both versions of the Medici were designed on the frame of the Maserati Indy as a four door fastback. Both versions had a longitudinally mounted 4.9 Liter V8, which was also borrowed from the Indy.  Medici I  The Medici I was built in the spring of 1974, and it shared many design elements with Giugiaro's previous Asso Di Picche concept. One influential feature of the Medici I was the trapezoidal C-pillar, which became wider as it ran down the side of the car. Giugiaro later used this design in many different cars, including the Lancia Delta I and the 1980 Audi Coupé. While the Medici's C-pillar was made of solid sheet metal, other vehicles such as the Audi 80 B2 and the Yugo Florida had an additional trapezoidal window in the C-pillar. The front end of the Medici I was very similar to Giugiaro's 1974 Maserati Coupé 2+2 (also known as Tipo 124), which was the potential successor to the Indy. Alike the Medici, the Coupé 2+2's front fascia ended in a point and had pop-up headlights. Inside, the Medici I was designed to have six seats. Behind the two front seats were two benches installed opposite each other; the passengers in the middle row sat opposite to the direction of travel. The space in the rear cabin was crowded, leading to changes for the Medici II. The Medici I was first publicly displayed in April 1974 at the Turin Auto Show.  Medici II  In 1976, Giugiaro presented Medici II. Unlike the Medici I, it was a four-seater. The interior was fully redesigned, and the benches were replaced by two chairs. The rear also included a bar, refrigerator, desk, and file holder, as well as a television and a radiophone which were futuristic for the time. The main difference in the styling of the Medici II was in the front fascia. Instead of the semi-pointed front of the Medici I, the Medici II carried a higher front end, allowing for four high-set square headlights and a square, chrome-framed grille. The Medici II is considered the stylistic predecessor of the Maserati Quattroporte III, which was produced starting in 1979. The DeLorean is also stylistically similar to the Medici II; numerous features of the Medici II were adopted. The same applies to the four-door Lancia Delta I. The high front end was also found in many other vehicles that Giugiaro developed in the late 1970s, including the Audi Coupe. Ford took elements of the front design for the second version of the Mercury Capri. The Medici II was exhibited at the 1976 Paris Motor Show and sold in 1977 to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Persia, who had a fondness for Maserati models. The car now resides in the Louwman Collection.

The self-worth theory of motivation, which is adapted from the original theory of achievement motivation, describes an individual's tendency to protect their sense of self-worth as the motive of avoiding failure and hence approaching success. Such theory commonly applies to students in the school context where frequent evaluation of one's ability and comparison between peers exist. A majority of students believe that being academically competent is a way of maintaining self-esteem, thus try to maximise their academic competence and avoid failure.Covington MV. 1998. The Will to Learn: A Guide for Motivating Young People. New York: Cambridge Univ. Press The effort an individual puts in for the maximisation of academic competence to protect self-worth is often defined as a “double-edged sword”; while it is an essential factor of success, it can also result in feelings of worthlessness and incapability if one fails. To avoid the conclusion of incapability and hence maintain self-worth, some students choose to use defensive strategies such as putting in less effort and setting low standards towards the event of evaluation.Duchesne, S., & McMaugh A. (2016). Educational psychology for learning and teaching (5th ed.). Sydney, Australia: Cengage Learning Australia. () These strategies, which support the maintenance of self-worth, are called self-handicapping and defensive pessimism respectively.  Self- handicapping  The strategy of self-handicapping allows an individual to justify failure by deliberately placing an obstacle on their way to success. In this way, an individual can blame the obstacle instead of one's inability when the outcome of their performance is unsatisfactory. Typical ways of self- handicapping include procrastination, reduction of effort or not willing to practice for upcoming tasks. Such performance-avoidance goals have a negative impact on an individual's attainment of performance. Thus, the strategy of self-handicapping has several negative consequences, including “low performance attainment, academic dissatisfaction, and subjective well-being,” as well as the positive consequence of protecting self-esteem. Additionally, unlike the strategy of defensive pessimism, self-handicapping is more about avoiding failure rather than approaching success. It usually occurs in circumstances where individuals put the avoidance of failure over successful performance. The self-presented dimension of self-handicapping also has been introduced. This self-reported strategy includes the exaggeration of obstacles that could impede successful performance, excuses of test anxiety and health- related problems.  Defensive Pessimism  In order to avoid the negative implication of failure on one's sense of self-worth, some students use the strategy of defensive pessimism; they deliberately have pessimistic thoughts about the upcoming tasks. This involves the establishment of low goals and low expectations towards the tasks for which one's ability will be evaluated. Establishing lower, thus safer, goals, which is achieved by lowering the standard of satisfactory performance, can help individuals to feel more satisfied with the outcome. Some students use the strategy of defensive pessimism to protect their sense of self-worth by deliberately having pessimistic thoughts about the upcoming tasks. Unlike the strategy of self- handicapping, defensive pessimism does not have a negative impact on the attainment of performance or task. Instead, the interference made on this strategy can have a negative influence on one's performance. However, while it does not have a negative impact on the attainment, defensive pessimism can provoke unhealthy consequences of “decreased life satisfaction, an eventual drop in performance level, and feelings of hopelessness and worry” as well as causing fatigue and emotional variability.Cantor, N., & Norem, J. K. (1989) Defensive pessimism and stress and coping. Social Cognition Vol. 7, 21p.  Defensive expectation and reflectivity  There are two important factors of defensive pessimism which are known as strategies of defensive pessimists; defensive expectation and reflectivity. Defensive expectation refers to individuals lowering their self-expectations towards the outcomes of the event where their ability will be evaluated, setting low standards towards which they will be judged. Other than reducing expectation towards one's performance in the task, individuals also tend to think about all the possible outcomes, either positive or negative, prior to an event or performance. This factor is referred to as reflectivity. The strategy of defensive expectation supports the protection of one's sense of self-worth in several ways. By setting lower thus safer expectations, individuals will have less difficult achievement standards which allows an easier approach to successful performance. In similar terms, reflectivity also assists the protection of one's self-worth by thinking through all the possible outcomes in advance. Such process of defensive reflection can serve as the motivation allowing an individual to concisely plan out and try their best in order to avoid negative outcomes and scenarios. While these two strategies of defensive pessimism can be seen in a negative light in association with individual's concerns, they rather support individual's improvement and work as a motivation to stimulate the increase of effort individuals put in the preparation process of a task or performance.  Ability, effort, and non-competitive learning structures  Students try to maximise their ability in various ways for the protection of their self-worth, as ability is considered as an essential factor of achievement and success which seemingly reflects an individual's worthiness. While individuals highly value their own ability from intelligence, effort from diligence is not as highly valued as ability; it is considered equally worthy as ability only in cases where the ultimate aim is an acquisition of knowledge. For the younger students who equate the value of effort and ability, their effort gives synergy effect to their sense of self-worth by supporting the promotion of ability. However, older students commonly miss the chance of receiving synergy effect as they abstain from putting in much effort due to the “threat of humiliation” which failure can yield. To majority of the failure-avoidant students, self-worth comes from the attainment of performance and the performance depends on their ability. Since performance from one's ability leads to the sense of self-worth, in situations where students fail to show successful performance, students try to be reflected as if they are capable enough to show successful performance for the protection of one's self-esteem. The failure-avoidant students strive to look competent, utilising failure avoiding strategies such as defensive pessimism and self-handicapping, as inability is a big threat to one's sense of self-worth. Instructing in a way that separates student's obsession of ability from willingness to learn is considered as an important role of instructors. By utilising non-competitive learning structures, instructors can stimulate students to seek for success rather than trying to avoid failure. The different attainments of student's performance – success or failure – which come from one's ability or effort have various implications on student's self-esteem and feelings. Success resulted from one's high ability and capability leads to the sense of self- esteem and feeling of pride. Similarly, when the student attains success from putting in low effort, it brings the sense of self-esteem and feeling of pride as it represents one's high ability and capability. On the other hand, student will experience feeling of guilt by facing the failure resulting from low effort, and feelings of shame as well as humiliation if one's low ability leads to failure. Majority of students prefer experiencing the feeling of guilt coming from reduction of effort above the feeling of humiliation which can be evoked from putting in high effort and yet failing. In order to keep students away from reduction of effort, instructing in a way that separates student's obsession of ability from willingness to learn is considered as an important role of instructors. Such ways of teaching include the utilisation of non-competitive learning structures which are known to stimulate students to seek for success rather than trying to avoid failure. For instance, “mastery learning” provides students with continuous test and study opportunities to raise their competency of subject-matter to the required level. It requires consistent effort and suggests the evaluation based on self-comparisons rather than comparison between peers. Another well-known example of non-competitive learning structure is referred to as cooperative learning. Each members of the team are allocated with sections of total assignment and are told to master the certain section. Afterwards, each member is expected to take responsibility and teach the acquired knowledge to the other members of the team. Such method of cooperative learning aims to let students experience the reward of contributing to the benefits of others, thus leading to the conclusion that such reward can surpass the experience of excelling others.  Quadripolar model of self-worth theory  The quadripolar model of self-worth theory demonstrates an individual's behaviour under the motivation to protect the sense of self-worth, with the representation of dual motives to avoid failure and approach success.Covington MV. 1992. Making the Grade: A Self-Worth Perspective on Motivation and School Reform. New York: Cambridge Univ. Press This two-dimensional model proposes four broad types of learners in terms of success oriented and failure avoidant. The four types of learners consist of those who are highly success oriented and lowly avoiding failure, learners who are low in both dimensions, learners who are highly avoiding failure and lowly success oriented, and learners who are high in both dimensions. The type of learners who are high in approaching success and low in avoiding failure are known as success oriented. This type of learners usually know the intrinsic value of studies and are not driven by the need to protect one's self-worth unlike other types of learners.Covington, M. V., & Omelich, C. L. (1991). Need achievement revisited: Verification of Atkinson's original 2 x 2 model. In C. D. Spielberger., I. G. Sarason., Z. Kulcsar., & G. L. Van Heck. (Eds.), Stress and emotion, Vol. 14. New York, NY: Hemisphere. The type of learners who are low in both approaching success and avoiding failure are known as failure accepters. These individuals mostly accept the implication of failure on one's ability and often reach the conclusion that one's ability is not capable enough, which can result in discontinuance of studies. Learners who are high in avoiding failure and low in approaching success are known as failure avoiders. Rather than trying to perform well and approach success on given tasks, failure avoiders put focus on avoidance of failure in order to protect their self-perceptions of ability. They show the characteristic of staying away from any circumstances with potential failure. The ways of avoiding failure include reduction of effort, setting unrealistically low standards and goals towards the event of evaluation, and making excuses for potential poor performance. Ironically, these efforts they put in for the avoidance of failure often result in failure, but seemingly due to less threatening reasons such as lack of effort rather than inability of oneself. Overstrivers are referred to as the type of learners who are both high in avoiding failure and approaching success. Unlike learners who are success oriented, overstrivers are particularly sensitive on the problem of failing as they have doubts about their status of ability and failure might result in confirmation of their lack of ability. For this reason, overstrivers are highly motivated by the need to avoid failure and thus to protect their self-perceptions of ability. The common characteristics of overstrivers are known as being bright and meticulous as well as hard-working.  Developmental dynamics  child-rearing practice. An individual's behaviour pattern shown in the situations where they are motivated to protect their sense of self- worth has been proven to have a clear relationship with child-rearing practice through the research of the drive-theory tradition. The early pioneering studies suggest that the success-oriented individuals usually have been nurtured in a warm environment where parents’ guidance takes place, receiving encouragement to make choices on their own and to practice being independent. The factors of warm nurturing environment and parents’ guidance supports the promotion of an individual's responsibility in the context of making decisions and “trying out new ideas”. Also, unlike the parents of failure-oriented students, these parents were found to disregard the poor performance of their children and reward their satisfying accomplishments instead. For instance, success-oriented college students reported the behaviours of their parents towards themselves in cases of successful performance and poor performance; they recalled that they were more often praised for successful performance and less punished for disappointing performance compared to the failure-avoiding students. For the parents of failure-oriented students, their characteristics are commonly known to be the opposite of success-oriented students’ parents; they usually give severe punishments to their children when the children's performance did not meet their expectations. Even in cases where their children's praiseworthy performance meets their expectations, children will be met with “faint praise and even indifference”. The studies of developmental dynamics also include ethnic factors. For instance, it has been demonstrated that Asian students usually receive more pressure of demanding family values than Anglo students. Hence they often fear academic failure which can possibly result in rejection from family, leading them to pursue success from the motivation of avoiding failure rather than being motivated from intrinsic reasons such as joy of learning.

History 1878 advertisement for Madame Weigel's paper patterns A knitting pattern magazine from the 1930s Weigel was born in Poland to August Astmann and his wife Emilie, née Sachs. She left for New York as a young girl, and became a designer for McCall's Patterns, where she met and married engineer Oscar Weigel (c. 1844 – 7 February 1915), born in Brunswick, Germany. They left for Australia aboard Mysore, arriving in Melbourne on 4 March 1876.Application for naturalisation: Oscar August Louis Robert Carl Weigel; National Archives online, accessed 6 March 2019. At least one other source has 1877. According to Weigel, she and her husband were in Australia on an extended honeymoon when she started cutting paper patterns for Melbourne friends who admired her dress sense. Within a year, with the help of a few staff in a small house in Fitzroy, The owner and editor of Table Talk, Maurice Brodsky, a close contemporary of Mme Weigel, was also born in Poland. she was producing patterns and marketing them mail-order as \\"American Paper Cut Patterns\\" from premises in Eastern Arcade, Melbourne, and soliciting for \\"agents everywhere\\". In 1880 she began publishing a monthly \\"Weigel's Journal of Fashions\\", edited by her accountant, Mrs Thompson, touted as the first to be all-Australian in content, production and printing, combining general information, stories and information about merchandise, with illustrated descriptions of the latest English and American fashions, adapted for Colonial conditions. Later that year the magazine was also being published in Sydney, and she had a retail establishment at 313 Pitt Street. Around 1885 she built offices and a factory at 229 Lennox Street (the Rowena Street corner), Richmond where they printed the tissue-paper patterns on their own machines. Her husband Oscar's magazine production team adopted photoengraving for Phil Ashley's artwork and installed a monotype press. A free pattern was included with each issue. In 1893 Oscar was naturalized, hence also was Johanna. Weigel retired from active involvement in the business sometime around 1910, and spent much of her time in world travel. Oscar died in 1915 in Los Angeles, where the couple had gone either on business or on a sentimental journey. Johanna returned to Melbourne, and lived for some time in St Kilda. In 1926 Madame Weigel Pty. Ltd., was founded 1926 with partners Weigel, Charles Reynolds (a machinist who had been with Weigel from the early days) and George Humphries and a capital of £10,000. She died in 1940 at her suite in the Oriental Hotel, Collins Street, the Melbourne address of Johanna and her companion Sarah Neilson for the last twelve years of her life. Her estate, valued at £71,844 was divided between five Melbourne hospitals, after her employees had been looked after, and with £20,000 set aside to fund the Oscar Weigel Exhibitions (i.e. scholarship) for engineering students at the University of Melbourne.

Participants built art and participated in self-directed performances.  History  In 1992, Desert Siteworks was conceived and directed by William Binzen. Desert Siteworks was held at Black Rock Springs with about 20 participants over the summer solstice. Binzen's \\"Desert House\\" was created for Desert Siteworks and in 1992 appeared at Burning Man on the Black Rock Desert playa as a gathering place, which predated Center Camp. In 1993, Binzen and Judy West co-produced the event at Trego Hot Springs, with about 100 participants. In mid-summer 1993, Pepe Ozan first built a Lingam at Desert Siteworks out of local clay at Trego. Ozan returned in August 1993 to build a larger one at Burning Man on the main playa and designed a ritual to go around the Lingam. In 1994, the event was held over the summer solstice at Bordello Hot Springs, also known as Frog Pond at Garett Ranch. Included was Paul Windsor's sand drawing titled \\"Celtic Endless Knot\\".  Impact  Some key organizers of Burning Man were also part of Desert Siteworks (John Law, Michael Mikel) and William Binzen was a friend of Larry Harvey. Hence, the two events saw lots of cross-pollination of ideas and participants. Many of the principles developed at Desert Siteworks (such as Leave-No-Trace) were adopted by Burning Man. In August 1994, at SOMAR Gallery in San Francisco, Adrienne Fuzee curated a show called \\"Primal Edge\\" that featured works from Desert Siteworks and Burning Man. The event was billed as a \\"collaborative urban experience\\" that featured \\"art installations, music, dance, projections and participator events.\\" In 2016, all of Binzen's Desert Siteworks sourcebooks, artist’s notes and work prints became part of the historical archives at the Center for Art + Environment at the Nevada Museum of Art.

Watts was educated at Audley Grammar School. He worked for a time as a coal miner, but he retrained as a mining engineer. In 1895, Watts was working at the Diglake Colliery, when it flooded. He ran to warn other miners of the danger, and played a prominent role in rescue efforts, repeatedly descending into freezing water, and was as a result awarded the silver medal of the Royal Humane Society. He later moved to work at the Mansfield Colliery in Longton, followed by work for the Stafford Iron and Coal Company. Watts became an active trade unionist, and at the 1918 United Kingdom general election was selected as the Labour Party's Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Stoke. However, the local North Staffordshire Miners' Federation decided not to sponsor him, and so he was forced to withdraw, due to lack of funds. At the 1922 United Kingdom general election, Watts did stand in Stoke, with sponsorship from the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He took 38.7% of the vote and second place, increasing this to 48.8% at the 1923 United Kingdom general election, but falling back to 42.7% at the 1924 United Kingdom general election.

The decree is in response to Romulo Antonio Braschi ordaining seven Catholic women to the priesthood of his movement, the Catholic Apostolic Charismatic Church of Jesus the King, on June 29, 2002, and is a follow up to a decree of excommunication of Braschi and the women issued on August 5, 2002.Decree of Excommunication Background In 1998, Braschi left the Catholic Church for the Catholic Apostolic Charismatic Church of Jesus the King and became bishop of it. On June 29, 2002, on a boat on the Danube River, Austria, Braschi ordained seven Catholic women, called the Danube Seven, to the priesthood: Christine Mayr-Lumetzberger, Adelinde Roitinger, Gisela Forster, Iris Müller, Ida Raming, Pia Brunner and Dagmar Braun Celeste (who called herself Angela White). The Bishop of Linz and of the Austrian Episcopal Conference intervened, but to no avail. On July 10, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith warned the eight persons that they would be excommunicated on July 22 if they did not repent. On August 5, the Congregation issued a decree of excommunication of the eight persons. The excommunicated people then published letters and granted interviews about the ordinations, explaining how it was valid, that the Catholic Church ought to allow women to be ordained, and how they had celebrated the sacraments. On August 14 and September 27, the people requested the Congregation to revoke the excommunication. The latter request made reference to canons regarding recourse against administrative decrees in the Code of Canon Law.Vatican.Va: Code of Canon Law 1732-1739 On October 21, the Congregation replied that it would look into the matter. Contents The decree explains the excommunicated party's background, then the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's response to the party's request for the revocation of their excommunication. The response was prepared by fifteen members of the Congregation: Cardinals Joseph Ratzinger, Alfonso López Trujillo, Ignace Moussa I. Daoud, Giovanni Battista Re, Francis Arinze, Jozef Tomko, Achille Silvestrini, Jorge Medina Estévez, James Francis Stafford, Zenon Grocholewski, Walter Kasper, Crescenzio Sepe, Mario Francesco Pompedda and Bishops Tarcisio Bertone, SDB, and Rino Fisichella. The fifteen members met multiple times to discuss the matter, and ultimately came to a \\"collegial decision\\" to not revoke the excommunication. The Congregation listed the reasons for why this was the case: the excommunication was not a latae sententiae penalty, but a ferendae sententiae penalty, as per Canons 1314, 1319, and 1347; the excommunication was issued by the Pope through the Congregation, as per Canon 360; the offense was grave and evident; the women, by choosing to be ordained by a schismatic, became schismatics themselves; the women rejected the magisterium of the Pope and the dogma on ordination that he definitively proposed in Ordinatio sacerdotalis; the women, by inciting other Catholics to schism, were justly punished so as to protect the faith, communion and unity of the church and guide the consciences of the faithful; and the excommunication was intended to provoke the six persons to repentance.

It documents first-hand many professional and personal aspects of Antarctic exploration, and highlights some of the physical and psychological hardships the men suffered. It was established in part to entertain the crew, all of whom were offered the opportunity to contribute. The magazine combines watercolour paintings, cartoons, and photographs with weather reports, essays, and other colloquial and scientific observations. Only one copy of each edition was originally printed. The twelve issues of the magazine are collected in four published volumes, and the Folio Society has published a complete edition.  Founding purpose  The magazine was founded to provide an outlet to entertain the men throughout their time in Antarctica and keep them occupied when weather prevented exploration.The Folio Society 2018, South Polar Times, The Folio Society, viewed 1 October 2018, https://www.foliosociety.com/row/south-polar-times.html. Through habitual recording of stories and events, the magazine offers insight into daily Antarctic life. In his journal, Scott writes about the perfect initial copy of the magazine, but acknowledges that in the circumstances, broad circulation would not be possible from their isolated location in Antarctica. The crew therefore endeavoured to reproduce the magazine for the public upon returning from Antarctica. The magazine was mostly produced in the months of May through to August. In these winter months, sunlight in Antarctica is scarce and often in mid-winter (June) the sun does not rise.Australian Antarctic Division 2017, Sunlight hours, Australian government, viewed 17 October 2018, http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/environment/weather/sunlight- hours Each completed issue of the magazine was read aloud to all men on the expedition upon the completion of each contributors work. Illustrations were created by hand and all text was generated on typewriters in order that the magazine featured various perspectives and generated broad discussion.Wheeler, S 2012, ‘The South Polar Times reminds us of Captain Scott’s doomed voyage’, The Telegraph, 17 February, viewed 1 October 2018, https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9089675/The-South-Polar-Times- reminds-us-of-Captain-Scotts-doomed-voyage.html The magazine gives various accounts of the complex problems encountered by Scott, such as the weather, boredom, lack of resources and isolation.  Final edition  The final edition of the series was produced in 1912 on the ‘Terra Nova' expedition. At this point, the men who were writing for the magazine were depleted of supplies at the Ross Island Hut. The winter of 1912 in Antarctica was marked by the death of Scott and several other members of his expedition party. The 12th edition encapsulates these events figuratively, stating that \\"beauty is linked to tragedy\\" in documenting the lifestyle in Antarctica. Although ‘Scott of the Antarctic' died attempting to reach the South Pole, no explicit reference to this event is made in the magazine. His body was found eight months later.BBC 2014, Scott of the Antarctic (1868-1912), BBC, viewed 2 October 2018, http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/scott_of_antarctic.shtml. Other men who perished included Edgar Evans, Lawrence Oates, Edward Wilson and Birdie Bowers. The magazine does not comment on these deaths either.  Content and style  The style of the magazine is colloquial and recounts the extreme conditions suffered in Antarctica. Creating the memento became a traditional means of gathering in community, therefore strict editing and censorship did not apply. The article has been described by historians as a creation at the \\"crossroads of art and science\\".Bartalos, M 2009, Scott's Discovery Hut, Part 2: The South Polar Times, California Acedemy of Sciences, California, viewed 20 October 2018, https://www.calacademy.org/blogs/the-long- view/scotts-discovery-hut-part-2-the-south-polar-times This interpretation offered by Michael Bartalos of the California Academy of Science is influenced by the fact that the publication was a single typewritten copy accompanied by detailed diagrams for aesthetic results. Scott explained in his preface of the first edition in 1902 that the men \\"knew that daylight would shortly disappear for four whole months\\", and consequently, the thoughts of expedition members turned to the long dark period ahead. Ultimately, this foreword frames the magazine as a means by which the men could lighten the winter's monotony.\\" Scott R, Shackleton, E, L Bernacchi, Cherry-Garrard A. (1907-14). South Polar Times, London & Cambridge Smith, Elder, & Co., [volume IV:] Scott Polar Research Institute.In the preface, Scott also proposed that the format should follow a mixed approach. Scott states that scientists contributions should be about their special subjects and scientific events of general interest. Lighter matter such as humorous anecdotes and poems was also encouraged. Illustrations of the landscape and wildlife also make up a substantial aspect of the magazine. A key contributor of these illustrations was the chief of scientific staff, Edward Wilson, who was an experienced artist. Wilson's notable roles on the expeditions was that of junior surgeon and zoologist. The extent of his artistry is exemplified by the fact that Wilson's created over two hundred sketches that feature in the South Polar Times. An example of the written work included in the South Polar Times is that entitled ‘Extracts from some Antarctic Archives', which is satirical in nature. It recounts the ‘barkinofdogs' and ‘neighinof horses' around the men's base. The excerpt also uses hieroglyphics. The magazine resembles a casual tone as the recounts are often told first hand. For example, segments of the publication are titled ‘Events of the month' and offer stories such as ‘April 6: An exciting seal chase' , ‘April 11: His Majesty the King became Patron of the Expedition' and ‘April 13: Windmill collapsed.' The variation of the works in the magazine extended to skits Griffith Taylor who composed ‘Valhalla.' Further, a common activity to pass time in the winter that is revealed in the South Polar Times is the composition of sonnets – a popular format of poetry in the Edwardian period.Millard, K. (1991-11-07). (Ed.), Edwardian Poetry, Oxford University Press. A diary is also kept alongside the South Polar Times which describes the types of events conducted on a monthly basis. It offers insight into the Local Debating Society competition. Other events that are documented include the monthly acrostic.Shackleton, E, H., Bernacci, L. C., Cherry- Garraed, A., Scott, R. F., & Wilson, E. (1902). The South Polar times. London, Orskey- Bonham-Niner. Insights of personal value such as nicknames can be located in the South Polar Times. For example, the expedition's chief doctor is referred to as ‘Cutlets' throughout the publishment rather than his actual name, Reginald Koettlitz. The South Polar Times also includes a number of photographs. The photographer was Herbert Ponting and he developed his work with equipment set up on both the huts and ships. Footage includes photographs of the transantarctic mountains and the expedition ships.  Mainstream production  The Folio Society has published a complete edition of all original issues of the expedition magazine. The reason the Folio Society engaged in mainstream production was to publish the fourth volume of The South Polar Times for the first time. This final volume was created during the winter of 1912. The production of this final volume also acts as a companion to volumes I, II and III which were published in London in 1907 and 1914 upon the return of the ‘Discovery' and ‘Terra Nova' expeditions respectively. The centenary edition which holds the first three volumes was originally reprinted in London by Smith, Elder & Co. It is printed on one side of leaf only. It only includes the first three volumes and is regarded as periodical material.OCLC WorldCat, 2018, SPT Details, WorldCat, viewed 1 October 2018, http://www.worldcat.org/title/south-polar-times/oclc/54495003. The first two volumes consisted of 250 copies each, and the third edition was made up of 350 copies. The modern Folio Society edition was published with the resources of the Royal Geographic Society and the British Library. It is bound in printed cloth. The pages are reprinted in the same dimensions as the original journal (11\\" x 8 ¼ \\"). It was reproduced to fulfil Scott's vision that the South Polar Times' audience would grow beyond the men on the expedition and transcend time. The Folio edition includes an introduction specifically curated by Ann Savours Shirley, who is an expert in historical polar publishing. The introduction describes the editorial process and the eventual publication. The front cover of this edition uses the same watercolour painting by Wilson as the cover of the 1902 cover. The front piece is an artistic work of three men hauling a sledge. Some of Wilsons notable works include the armorial title page which shows two empower penguins framing a shield. The shield is an impression of Mt Erebus. Although Wilson was the principal illustrator, officers and crew often contributed in creating illustrations to be published alongside poems and other written work. In the preface of the first edition, Scott provides some context for future readers by stating that \\"Owners of these volumes will possess an exact reproduction of the original South Polar Times.\\" No explanatory notes accompany any editions of Scott's Antarctic journal. The sole edification of the end product ensures that readers are provided with the same experience as the men who created the original copy of the South Polar Times.  Editors and contributors  Over the course of the magazine's creation, three key figures were effectively editors. The original editor was Ernest Shackleton. Shackleton's editorship of the South Polar Times has been described as \\"natural\\" as he \\"had a fondness for literature.\\" Whilst editor, Shackleton also contributed substantially with original verses and writings. From 1903, Louis Bernacchi played a central role as editor. Since Bernacchi had substantial scientific knowledge, information recorded in the South Polar Times was drawn upon in subsequent presentations given globally. In Scott's 1911 expedition, Apsely Cherry-Gerrard edited the third edition but did not publish it until 1914. Although specific roles were assigned to particular members of Scott's Antarctic expeditions, it is noted in the preface to the first edition that a central condition of the production relied on the notion that it was to be open to all and that \\"the men as well as the officers were to be invited to contribute to its pages.\\" Also noted by some researchers of the South Polar Times is the fact that the success of this publication was a likely impetus for the printing of the Aurora Australis publication in 1908.  Access to wider audiences  The South Polar Times is focused on the human aspect of Polar exploration. It is held by numerous public libraries worldwide. Libraries in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, the US hold copies for members of the public to access and is most often held in the rare books collection. Although the item is accessible to read, it must often be requested in advance and viewed in the library's reading rooms. Furthermore, some copies are listed as fragile material and therefore cannot be used by the public. In such circumstances, libraries such as the National Library of Australia offer a microform copy. Various videos and voiceovers have also been published online which include details about the various essays included in the South Polar Times, such as ‘Physical Observations being conducted in the Winter Quarters and the purpose of such investigations.' Footage of the primary source is evident in this content and shares the men's observations with a wider audience. As the magazine contains information with reference to maps, plans and diagrams, readers can be both entertained and informed about the conditions in Antarctica.Nick, E 2018, Dramatic increase in readership forecast for South Polar Times, online video, 28 June, viewed 1 October 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZyEG7edZ9s The copyright status of the South Polar Times is also an important factor in the ability for publishing houses to print extensive copies of the test. For example, in Australia, the magazine is protected under copyright until 2029. This copyright status is determined by the fact that the presumed death of the latest creator was 1959 plus 70 years.  Cultural significance  The South Polar Times is reflective of the shift from commercial exploitation to scientific exploration in Antarctica. The renewed interest in science is reflected by editor Bernacci's statement that \\"Antarctic exploration is of capital importance to science\\".Australian Antarctic Division 2017, The scientific era begins, Australian government, viewed 17 October 2018, http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/history/exploration-and- expeditions/the-scientific-era-begins Those who conducted such research offer another perspective in the South Polar Times. The emotive language employed by the contributors adds a layer of struggle to the period of Antarctic exploration. Scott expresses the fact that after each volume was completed, it was \\"held fast in the Antarctic Ice.\\" The harsh conditions of exploration are recounted in a segment of the publishment which tells the story of the disappearance of one man in the sledging party after a blizzard occurred. The scientific findings that are dispersed throughout the South Polar Times are reflective of the substantial contributions the expeditions made to meteorology, magnetism, geology and biology. Further, of all the 400 total pages on such content, almost every text is accompanied by an illustration.

Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS Cabot is a land-based naval training establishment crewed by part-time sailors and also serves as a local recruitment centre for the Canadian Forces Naval Reserve. It is one of 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada.  History  Since its commissioning in 1949, HMCS Cabot has paraded at three stone frigates in St. John's, Newfoundland. Initially commissioned at Buckmaster's Field, HMCS Cabot was part of a Tri-Force Headquarters along with the Army and Air Force. The original Ship's Company were sailors who served in World War II as part of the Royal Navy, Royal Navy Reserve, and the Royal Canadian Naval Reserve. The first parade on 20 September 1949 consisted of 11 officers, 29 men and 26 University Naval Training Division (UNTD) Cadets. It was thought that the unit was commissioned at the beginning of the academic year, well before it was ‘properly organised or prepared’, to accommodate the UNTD Cadets so they might commence their naval training as soon as possible. All administrative issues quickly being overcome, the past operational experience and seamanship of the Ship's Company became readily apparent when they sailed the unit tender, HMCS Revelstoke, to Bermuda in 1951, participating in naval exercises en route. In the 1950s and 1960s HMCS Cabot was quite the social hub with many functions in the community including Christmas and New Year Balls, Valentine's Day dances, Mess Dinners, Trafalgar balls along with less-formal children's parties, lobster boil-ups, and open houses and receptions for visiting ships. The increase in members, and the demand for more space to house the growing unit, prompted the move to Building 314 in Pleasantville, the former United States army base. This move helped HMCS Cabot distinguish itself and form its own identity separate from the Tri-Force HQ at Buckmaster's Field. One of the threads that have helped form a cohesive unit throughout HMCS Cabot's history is participation in sport. Hockey had been a favorite sport of many of Cabot members, and the unit often played against other teams in the Civil Service Hockey League in the early 1960s. Basketball, bowling, swimming, and softball all helped the members come together as a team. Rowing in the annual Royal St. John's Regatta was also very important and a source of great pride in the perseverance of excellence. This tradition was recently taken up once again as Cabot members rowed as part of the CFS ST JOHNS team in several regattas in 2008. Cabot enjoyed the use of many tenders throughout its sixty-year history: Revelstoke, and Langara were replaced by Acadian, which was transferred to NCSM Montcalm. PB 199 Standoff, a former RCMP boat, was sent to HMCS Cabot in 1980. Standoff was a 75-foot wooden vessel, and could crew six to nine sailors comfortably. It had two Cummins V-12 diesel engines, capable of 1400 hp and a top speed of 16 knots. This vessel served HMCS Cabot for seventeen years, performing many tasks at home and abroad, including circumnavigating the island , wreath laying ceremonies, and various training exercises, before being retired in 1996. There was a long standing desire to have a training facility on or near the water. After much consultation, a prime location on the South Side of St. John's Harbour, Pier 27, was chosen as the new berth for the stone frigate. This placed HMCS Cabot between the Canadian Coast Guard and the Marine Institute's training school. The boathouse at Pier 27 opened on 5 January 1998, and the state-of-the-art training facility at Pier 27 opened on 19 February 2000. This provided the unit with the ability to train personnel in many fields to prepare for operational deployments and trade coursing.

Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS Cataraqui is a land-based naval establishment for part-time sailors as well as a local recruitment centre for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). It is one of 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada.  History  Established on the site of the old Feed Mill at the foot of Princess Street in 1939, HMCS Cataraqui was first commissioned as a tender to HMCS Stadacona on 1 November 1941 and then recommissioned as an independent shore establishment on 1 September 1942. From 1943 to 1959, Cataraqui occupied a former school on 47 Wellington Street that also served as the Kingston Badminton Club. After the Second World War, apart from recruiting and training naval reservists in Kingston with its \\"fleet\\" of two harbour craft and a Ville class tug, the unit also undertook training of sailors in Brockville, Gananoque, Napanee, Bellville and Picton. The unit also housed a University Naval Training Division (UNTD), a program that aimed to secure recruits who will otherwise enter the army's COTC Canadian Officers Training Corps or the air force's University Air Training Plan (UATP). In 1954, naval air squadron VC 921 was formed under the command of Lieutenant-Commander (Pilot) Allen Burgham in Kingston. As a tender to Cataraqui, the naval air squadron maintained a facility at Norman Rogers airfield operating Harvards and one C-45D Expeditor until it was disbanded in 1959. As a result of clocking 1,092 accident-free flying hours in its inaugural year, the squadron was the first to win the Naval Reserve Safe Flying Award presented by Commodore K.F. Adams CD, RCN, Commanding Officer Naval Reserve Divisions. In 1959, the unit moved into a new facility located across from the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) campus until 1972 when the building was transferred to the RMC. Needing a new home, Cataraqui moved to the Kingston Armoury located at 100 Montréal Street. In 1992, the unit once again moved into its new building at 24 Navy Way, where today naval reservists train towards contributing to Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) operations, including: domestic safety operations as well as security and defence missions, while at the same time supporting the Navy's efforts in connecting with Canadians.

Bouquet sou were a series of tokens that were created for use primarily within Lower Canada in the mid- to late-1830s. Roughly equivalent in value to a half penny, the \\"bouquet sou\\" were so called because they displayed a group of heraldic flowers tied together with a ribbon on their obverse. The group of flowers were encircled by one of several legends, which might say \\"Trade & Agriculture / Lower Canada\\", \\"Agriculture & Commerce / Bas Canada\\" or some variant of these that might also substitute the name of the issuing bank. The other side most typically gave the denomination of \\"un sou\\", surrounded by a wreath and the words \\"Bank Token\\" and \\"Montreal\\". There are a large variety of these tokens, distinguished primarily by the number and variety of flowers that appear in the \\"bouquet\\", along with the differences in the legends that appeared on either side of the token. They were initially issued by the banks of Lower Canada, and were later imitated by speculators who produced tokens that looked similar, but were underweight for their denomination. These coins also circulated to Upper Canada, as at least one archeology dig attests.Kleeberg p. 165 Large numbers of these tokens were produced and many examples can easily be obtained for only a few C$dollars, though a few rare varieties can command significantly higher prices.Bell p. 366 History First Bouquet Sous Both sides of the first \\"bouquet sou\\" token (Breton 713, LC-2), issued in 1835. This version includes the wrong spelling for \\"sou\\", here pluralized to \\"sous\\". In both Lower and Upper Canada in the early 19th century, there was little in the way of circulating coinage, and merchants struggled to use what coinage there was available that came in a variety of denominations from numerous countries, including, England, the United States and Mexico.Denison p. 443-444 To remedy this situation, the Bank of Montreal issued the first bouquet sou token in July 1835.Faulkner p. 366 They were minted in New York State, and about 500,000 pieces were created.Faulkner p. 366 This first bouquet sou had a floral design consisting of shamrocks, roses, thistles and ears of wheat, surrounded by an inscription saying \\"Trade & Commerce / Lower Canada\\". The reverse depicts the denomination as \\"Un Sous\\", surrounded by a laurel wreath and the legend \\"Bank Token Montreal\\".Grawey 2018 p. 15 The flowers and leaves used on the obverse represented the immigrant peoples of Lower Canada, the shamrock representing Ireland, the rose for England, the thistles a symbol for Scotland, and the wheat representing the staple crop of Quebec. The inscription for the denomination was in error, as in French it ought to have read \\"Un Sou\\", using the singular form of \\"sou\\", and it is thought that the dies for this initial design were engraved by a die maker not fluent in French.Cross p. 90 The next batch of these tokens issued by the Bank of Montreal included the name of the bank in place of \\"Bank Token Montreal\\", and it is thought that the original, anonymous legend was used as the bank had not yet received official permission from the provincial government to issue the tokens, which came the following year.Cross p. 90 The Belleville Series While the Montreal banks issued bouquet sou of the correct weight for their denomination, speculators began importing tokens of similar design but of slightly lower weight, thereby profiting from the difference in face value from the cost of having the coin made. The exchange broker Dexter Chapin imported a large quantity of bouquet sou that were minted in Belleville, New Jersey.Cross p. 113 At least 13 of these Belleville issued bouquet sou were created by this mint and then imported into Lower Canada. The initial issues came from dies cut by John Gibbs of the Belleville mint.Willey 128 The \\"Rebellion Sou\\" An example of a Bouquet Sou dating to the 1837 (the year of the Lower Canada rebellion), called the \\"Rebellion Sou\\" (Breton 716, LC-4), as it contains a star and liberty cap in its design. On October 23–24, 1837, the Assembly of the Six Counties () was held in Saint-Charles, Lower Canada. It was an assembly of Patriote leaders and approximately 6,000 followers, protesting the Russell Resolutions. It was a prelude to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837. At this assembly a boycott was proposed for all English-produced goods along with the use of British coinage.Courteau p. 3-4 As a result, the bouquet sou became popular within the province and became known as the \\"Sous des Patriotes\\".Cross p. 113 In 1837 a new die was created for a bouquet sou being produced with a legend naming La Banque du Peuple.Courteau p. 10 Designed by the Montreal engraver Joseph Arnault,Courteau p. 3 the reverse includes two emblems of liberty: a star to the left and a Phrygian cap to the right. The star was a symbol popular in contemporary U.S. coinage, perhaps suggesting a willingness to join the union, and the cap, also known as a \\"Liberty Cap\\", represented freedom from British rule.McLachlan1892 p. 13 A manuscript has been found in the National Archives of Canada claiming that this token was released in Saint-Charles on the first day of the Assembly of the Six Counties.Willey p. 125 As it was released in the same year as subsequent Lower Canada Rebellion, it became known as the \\"Rebellion Sou\\". It has been claimed that these symbols were introduced by an employee of the Bank who was a member of Société des Fils de la Liberté, a militant wing of the Assembly of the Six Counties,Courteau p. 10 or by someone at the bank sympathetic to their cause.Cross p. 94 All of the bank's directors came under suspicion of being rebels, and warrants were later issued for their arrest.Cross p. 94 The Birmingham Series As the popularity of the bouquet sou grew in Lower Canada, further anonymous speculators started to import new tokens from Birmingham, England, from the mint that designed the original bouquet sou for the Bank of Montreal.Cross p. 128 These bouquet sou tend to have the legend \\"Bas Canada\\", though at least one issue uses the English equivalent \\"Lower Canada\\".Cross p. 128-132 Montreal Issues As demand for the bouquet sou continued to grow, additional varieties were minted within Montreal. These varieties varied considerably in terms of quality, size and weight.Cross p. 133 All of the legends of these tokens are in French.Willey 134 Replacement and Redemption The many unofficial and underweight versions of the bouquet sou reached a critical point, and the banks in Lower Canada stopped accepting them.Cross p. 113 To replace the bouquet sours, the Montreal banks began to issue half pennies and pennies in what became known as the Habitant token design.Cross p. 97 An ordinance issued in June 1838 declared that the only legal tender than would be accepted within Lower Canada were copper coins issued by the United Kingdom, American cents, and the new bank- issued \\"Habitant\\" tokens.Willey 128 As bouquet sou were returned to the banks, they were redeemed for the new coinage, and evidently the old bouquet sous found a new existence in Upper Canada where they were shipped, as the ordinance did not apply there.Willey 128 Numismatic Study This coin series was first described in numismatic literature by the early Canadian numismatist R.W. McLachlan in his book Canadian Numismatics, published in 1886. He called the coins the \\"un sou\\" series, and was the first to comprehensively describe their background, characteristics and to describe their manufacture, where known.McLachlan1886 p. 14-26 He described more than 40 varieties of the tokens, arranging the chief varieties into nine different groups, arranged by the similarity of their design and who was thought to have created them. He noted key differences in the type and number of heraldic flowers used on the reverse, the differences in the legends that were used, and the shape of the ribbon used to tie the bouquet.McLachlan1886 p. 14-26 The name \\"bouquet sou\\" to describe these tokens came from Canadian numismatist Pierre-Napoléon Breton, who depicted many of the varieties in his book Illustrated History of Coins and Tokens Relating to Canada, originally published in 1890.Breton1894 p. 5 In his Breton numbering system for these tokens, they run from 670-716,Breton1894 p. 98-112 totaling 46 main varieties. Breton roughly followed the order of the tokens as described in McLachlan's earlier book, which ended up with many of the tokens produced later appearing earlier in his numbering system, and those that were produced first at the end. Breton's illustrations are finely detailed, and some modern publications still use them (as opposed to using photographs of the tokens) to help collectors distinguish between the many varieties.Cross p. 113-136Stanley 17-22 Breton sorted the bouquet sou according to the number of leaves contained within the wreath on the obverse.Willey 128 Modern guides list over 50 tokens belonging to the bouquet sou series, many of which have significant variants, including die orientation, planchet thickness and being struck on different metals to name a few. Overstruck examples McLachlan also mentioned that he was aware of examples of the Bouquet Sou tokens that had been overstruck on top of earlier token issues, including brass examples of a Bust and Harp token and Tiffins tokens.Grawey 2016 p. 8 More modern studies of the bouquet sou have discovered additional varieties that were unknown to the 19th century numismatists, including at least one issue that was struck over previously minted coins. These include a few examples struck over Blacksmith tokens, possibly in a bid to covert \\"uncirculatable\\" tokens to the more popular and acceptable bouquet sou.Willey p. 134 Numismatist R.C. Willey described a number of additional, earlier token types that had otherwise been \\"rendered obsolete when the banks would no longer take them except by weight\\".Grawey 2016 p. 8 He listed additional examples of Bouquet Sous that had been overstruck on a Brock token, a Ships Colonies and Commerce token, and on a Sloop token.Grawey 2016 p. 8 Notes Bibliography       *  External links  * CoinsAndCanada.com: Bouquet - 1 sou 1838 Coins Coins of Canada Copper coins ","title":"Bouquet sou"},{"id":"58793873","text":"Gudiel is a surname.

Early life  Shams al-Mulk Isma'il, born in 1113, was the son of Taj al-Muluk Buri, the atabeg of Damascus, and his wife Zumurrud. Two Assassins wounded Buri in the stomach in May 1132 in revenge for the massacre of their fellows in Damascus. Buri suffered for 13 months before he died in June 1133. Ismail succeeded his father and decided to seize Banias, which had previously been taken by Baldwin II of Jerusalem with the Assassins' assistance. Ismail attacked Banias and captured it on 11 December 1132. Ailba, a female slave of Ismail's grandfather, Toghtekin, made an attempt on Ismail's life in 1134. After being captured, she listed the names of many peoples who desired Ismail's death because of his tyrannical acts. He ordered the arrest of the alleged conspirators, including his half- brother, Sawinj, who starved to death in the prison. Fearing for his life, Ismail left Damascus and settled in the fortress of Salkhad. He also sent envoys to his father's old enemy, Imad ad-Din Zengi, the atabeg of Aleppo and Mosul, seeking his protection in exchange for Damascus. Ismail was murdered on February 1, 1135. The author of the contemporaneous Damascus Chronicle of the Crusades accused Ismail's mother of ordering his servants to kill him, because Ismail also wanted to kill her lover. She appointed her younger son Shihab al- Din Mahmud to rule Damascus.

It is considered one of the Middle Ages' largest attacks on the Jews, who were ultimately expelled from the Iberian Peninsula in 1492. While the Jews in the Iberian Peninsula at this time were generally disliked, violence against the Jews and especially against the conversos was common even until the 1400s. However, 1391 marked a peak in the violence against the Jews.  Attitudes toward the Jews in the 1300s  In the years leading up to the Massacre of 1391, the Jews were not particularly liked by the Catholic church because, according to the Catholic interpretation of the New Testament at the time, they had crucified the Christ, but there was tolerance as they were under the protection of Spain and had crucial roles in banking and finance that made them a financial asset. In the early fourteenth century (1311–12) the general council of Vienne met and decided to censor the Moor's religious freedoms, and some would claim that the general council became aware of what their neighbors thought of their tolerance of the Jews, and therefore returned to Spain with a newfound goal to damage the peaceful tolerance between the Jews, Moors, and larger Spanish population. However, while it is likely that this inspired ill feelings towards the Jews, there was no drastic result because of the current tax on the Jewish people which contributed greatly to the kingdom and the church. Thus, the Jews were too much of an economic asset to be violently discriminated against.  Violence in the early 1300s  Peter (Pedro) I (known by his enemies as Peter the Cruel) was the king of Castile from 1350 to 1365. Unlike the norm of abusing the Jews financially, Peter was sympathetic to the Jews. Some would explain his Jewish sympathy by claiming that he was illegitimately Jewish himself. While a rebel against the church, Peter the Cruel had become a sort of protector of the Jews against Henry of Trastamara, his half-brother. Henry had killed around 1,200 Jews in 1355, ordered a Jewish massacre in 1360, and was involved in the murder of many other Jews in 1366. When Peter's half-brother Henry killed him during a battle in a civil war in 1369, the Jews lost their royal protection and became the subject of attacks in Castile. The Jews also were greatly taxed. While Henry had criticized his brother for being in support of the Jews, he himself became tolerant of them because of the financial burdens placed on them and the services they provided. Because of Henry's violence toward the Jews, the common people of Spain began to accept this violent antisemitism, but the Jews were too important financially to be completely annihilated. The tragedy of 1391 would not have been possible without the Archdeacon of Ecija, Ferrand Martinez, whose actions ignited this tragedy against the Jewish people. Ferrand Martinez was a well-respected and prominent member of the Catholic church, but in his preaching, Martinez would use political anti-Judaism to aid him as he harshly criticized the Jews and would stir the people up against them. Martinez would carry his prejudices with him as a religious judge as he would illegally wrong the Jews because of his negative feelings toward them. He even went so far as to write to the nearby authorities and command them to remove the Jews from living among them. The Jews of Seville became greatly concerned with Martinez's orders, so they reached out to the King of Castile. Because of their importance to his finances, Henry sided with the Jews in 1378 and told Martinez to stop his persecution of the Jews. However, Martinez ignored Henry and continued to preach violence against the Jews as he abused his power in the religious judiciary. The Jews continued to complain to the king about the injustices against them, and Martinez was warned in 1382, 1383, and 1388 to stop abusing his power and preaching that the king would not punish anyone who attacked or killed the Jews. When Martinez continued to declare his strong beliefs against the Jews, the king was once again informed of his harmful actions, but rather than take immediate action, he simply commended Martinez for his religious zeal but also reminded him that the Jews were still under the crown's protection. This only fed Martinez as he continued to stir up the people through his harmful sermons against the Jews. It wasn't until 1389 that Archbishop Barroso suspended Martinez from both preaching and his judicial position because he had publicly and inaccurately preached on the Pope's power. While Martinez' suspension did give the Jews some relief, it was short lived; in 1390 both Archbishop Barroso and the king died, resulting in Martinez gaining a higher position in the church and his suspension being terminated. Martinez used his newfound position and power to order the Jewish synagogues to be destroyed, the materials used in Catholic churches, and the Jewish books to be sent to him. This destruction and the force used to fulfill it rightly frightened the Jews of Seville, who once again reached out to the authorities to protect them from Martinez' oppression. In early 1391, the authorities wrote to the religious leaders in Seville and claimed that they were responsible for electing Martinez in a position of such power and they ordered that he right his wrongdoings to the Jews, that he rebuild their synagogues, and that he be removed from his religious position. In response to the crown's orders, Martinez claimed that the crown had no authority over him and that he was subject to only the Catholic church. He ignored his orders to rebuild the synagogues and stop preaching against the Jews. Martinez' refusal to obey the crown's orders only illustrated his zeal for his belief that he was doing the right thing by persecuting the Jews, and his followers shared the same zeal because he had been riling them up for so long. As his preaching of violence against the Jews continued, so did the uneasiness of the mob as they were anxiously awaiting the opportunity to attack and raid the Jews. Around March the mob broke out and plundered and killed Jews, and while they were stopped from even further violence, the antisemitic mob mentality had already spread to nearby cities.  Violence in 1391   Violence in Seville and Castile  Martinez continued to stir up the people against the Jews as he preached that they should be forced to convert to Christianity. Violence finally erupted on June 6 when around 4,000 Jews in Seville were murdered, their houses were attacked and destroyed, and those that weren't killed were terrified into converting in an attempt to not be murdered as well. The violence against the Jews originated in Castile, and acted as a catalyst for further violence against the Jews. This pattern of violence continued through over 70 other cities and towns within three months, as city after city followed the example set in Seville and Jews faced either conversion and baptism or death, their homes were attacked, and the authorities did nothing to stop or prevent the violence and pillaging of the Jewish people. As this fanaticism and persecution spread throughout the rest of the kingdom of Castile, there was no accountability held for the murders and sacking of the Jewish houses, and estimations claim that there were 50,000 victims (though it is likely this number was exaggerated).  Violence in Aragon  This religious mob spread even to Aragon, as the authorities could do nothing to prevent the same pattern of plunder, murder, and fanaticism (although it did not go completely unpunished). About 100,000 Jews in Aragon converted rather than face death or attempt to flee.  Valencia  One of the first of the cities the antisemitic violence spread to was the city of Valencia in the kingdom of Valencia,of the Commonwealth of Aragon. After the violence in Seville and Castile, on June 28, Queen Iolant of Aragon ordered city officials to be especially protective of the Jews. However, the situation continued to escalate and in July Prince Martin (King John's brother) was placed in charge of protecting the Jews against persecution. Martin had gallows set up outside the Jewish area as a threat to those who would be inclined to attack the Jews, extra surveillance for security, and criers would go around proclaiming that the Jews were under the crown's protection (although the criers were revoked on July 6). The Jews in Valencia were attacked on July 9. The violence started out with several youths outside the Jewish community shouting that the Jews should convert or be killed, and the situation continued to escalate to the point of violence. As a crowd began to gather, they began throwing stones at the guards, and, against MartÍ's attempts to stop the crowd, they used pipes to break through the walls and forcefully enter the gates of the Jewish community and attack the Jews. The Jewish houses were pillaged and they themselves were killed and raped by the angry mob. Prince MartÍ recorded that nearly 300 Jews had been killed that day and that there weren't any Jews left who could have been baptized. Other sources claim around 230 Jews were murdered and many of the remainders were forced to be convert. There were around 2,500 Jews in the community, and only about 200 escaped murder and conversion. While MartÍ was quick to state that this violence against the Jews could have only been explained as judgment from God, King John was not so willing to give up his sovereignty over his people who had explicitly disobeyed both him and his brother, who was present at the attack trying to prevent it. John told MartÍ that there must be harsh consequences and that the mob must be brutally punished lest the violence spread and cause harm to more Jews. As punishment, MartÍ imprisoned several of the attackers and had a man hanged (he had tried to attack Muslims). King John criticized his brother's minimal punishments for such brazen disobedience to the crown, and said that he would have had three to four hundred people killed, but now they must put the law on hold and serve punishment on their own. Around 11,000 Jews in Valencia converted rather than face death or attempt to flee.

That job was to assist Michael Jackson’s official photographer at the time, Sam Emerson, during the “Black or White” video. He remained as the photographer's assistant for 3 years, while simultaneously working as a freelance photographer. While working for Jackson, he went to Neverland Ranch, attended Michael Jackson’s appearance at the 1993 Super Bowl halftime show, worked on Jackson’s music videos, and assisted on the Dangerous World Tour. After returning from the tour, Sam Emerson was let go, and he was offered the opportunity to become the head photographer based on the results from a test shoot in New York City. The shoot involved Jackson wearing a military uniform and tassels on the shoulders. Jackson was pleased with the results, and hired him as the official photographer. He was the official photographer while Jackson was recording his HIStory album, shooting stills and single covers for the songs “Smile,” “Scream,” and “You Are Not Alone.” He also covered Jackson’s philanthropy work with hospital visits and with the Heal the World Foundation.

Michael Schulson wrote Khan has written articles for publications associated with the alt-right and his career is an example of the \\"murky line between mainstream science and scientific racism.\\" Khan's publications have been cited by popular science writers, including his work on the migrations of Southeast Asian Civilizations, Jewish migrations family genetics, and consumer genetics. In 2014, Khan made news when he sequenced his son's genome while still in utero. Antonio Regalado wrote his son may be the first healthy person to have his entire genome sequenced before being born. In an interview with Don Gonyea, Khan stated his child was the most important thing in his life, so it made sense to know everything about his genetics. He was able to obtain the genome sequence by requesting a chorionic villus sampling (CVS) test. After obtaining the raw genetic data, Khan used the free software Promethease to analyze the data. Khan believes society is in the \\"second age of eugenics,\\" and full genome sequences of fetuses will become standard procedure for parents in the 21st century. Ainsley Newsome wrote \\"Khan's decision to obtain the whole genome sequence of his partner's fetus while in utero shows us that genomics is no longer a fantasy.\\" In March 2015, the New York Times announced that it hired Khan on a short-term contract, and he will write about once a month for the Times. The Times wrote he is \\"a science blogger and a doctoral candidate in genomics and genetics at the University of California, Davis. He writes about evolution, genetics, religion, politics and philosophy.\\" The same day the Times announced hiring Khan, Gawker published an opinion piece written by J.K Trotter, who noted that Khan also wrote blogs for Taki's Magazine, a site \\"founded in 2007 by Taki Theodoracopulos, the flamboyantly racist Greek.\\" As a result of Khan's history of writing for controversial publications, the Times removed him as a regular periodic contributor, but stated they remain \\"open to consideration of submissions from him\\" in the op-Ed pages. The Times did not specifically mention the part of Khan's work they found uncomfortable, and he wrote two op-eds for the Times before they ended his contract. Khan wrote on Twitter, \\"yeah, told me today. may contribute one-off op-eds in future. i’m chill about it. it wasn’t a surprise that ppl went ballistic.\\" In a 2016 interview with the economist and podcaster James Miller, referring to the cancelled Times contract, Khan stated, \\"I have a clean conscience because I say what I think is true.\\"  Other projects  In December 2010 Khan co- founded the group blog Brown Pundits together with British-Pakistani Bahá'í Zachary L. Zavidé and Pakistani-American Omar Ali. The blog pertains mainly to South Asian issues. In October 2018 they began an associated podcast called The Brown Pundits Podcast.

The season is produced by ABC Signature Studios, Marvel Television, and Wandering Rocks Productions, with Pokaski serving as showrunner. Olivia Holt and Aubrey Joseph star as Bowen and Johnson, with Gloria Reuben, Andrea Roth, J. D. Evermore, and Emma Lahana also starring. In July 2018, the series was renewed for a second season, with filming beginning that October. The season premiered on April 4, 2019, and concluded on May 30 on Freeform.

Holland as Duane Porter Production Development On July 20, 2018, Freeform renewed the series for a 10-episode second season. Writing The majority of the writers for the first season return for the second. During the first season, showrunner Joe Pokaski noted the final episode would leave \\"some stuff open, intentionally\\" to be addressed in the second season, though its post-credit scene was \\"tremendously definitive\\" and would \\"help define some of the\\" direction for the second season; this scene establishes Brigid O'Reilly as a threat to the heroes, while the announcement trailer for the second season teased the inclusion of her comics alter ego Mayhem. Pokaski compared the character to the villain Killmonger from Marvel's Black Panther (2018) in that he believed she would be a villain that the audience could relate to, describing her as \\"kind of what we wish we all were if we didn’t face consequences\\". He added that a lot of the development that the character has in the first season was written as an origin story for the character to become a villain in the second season. He further described her as \\"one of the first big scary things\\" that Tandy and Tyrone face in the second season. The first- season finale also introduces Tyrone's ability to absorb people into his cloak, and Pokaski said that Tyrone is \\"a doorway to something\\" and \\"we’re going to step into that doorway a little more\\" in the second season. Pokaski enjoyed being able to unfold the characters' powers like this so they could be tied to emotions. Pokaski said the season would explore his favorite element of superhero stories: people balancing their personal life with their responsibility as a hero. He said it would also show how a person can become a vigilante in a way that he hoped would be unique from other installments in the superhero genre. The season also sees the living arrangements of Tandy and Tyrone reversed from the first, with Tyrone now on the run from the police and living in the abandoned church that Tandy had been living in, until she moved back in with her mother at the end of the first season. Pokaski felt this would allow them to explore a side of Tandy that she herself has neglected, as well as showing who Tyrone is without the \\"brave face\\" he has been putting on. The season will also continue to explore vodun and the \\"Divine Pairing\\" mythology established in the first season, with Pokaski saying, \\"We want to respectfully continue to use Vodun as a mirror upon which we show not only our moral, but our psychological abstracts of our characters.\\" Casting Olivia Holt, Aubrey Joseph, Gloria Reuben, Andrea Roth, and Emma Lahana return to star in the season as Tandy Bowen / Dagger, Tyrone Johnson / Cloak, Adina Johnson, Melissa Bowen and Brigid O'Reilly, respectively. J. D. Evermore also returns as James Connors. Former series regular Miles Mussenden recurs in the season as Otis Johnson, along with returning guest stars Noëlle Renée Bercy as Evita Fusilier and Angela Davis as Chantelle Fusilier.

After besieging Edessa for a short time, he marched towards Aleppo where he wanted to establish his base of operation.

He was born on December 11, 1985, as Hector Jesus Carreon Zuñiga in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico. Early years At the age of five, Carreon moved to Ciudad Juárez, a border town with El Paso, Texas. He was raised in a unique town culture, where Mexican and American language and traditions blended. This had a profound influence on Carreon. He had the uncommon opportunity to live in Mexico and cross the border every day to attend school in the United States. Carreon began playing the guitar at age 11 in a choir at his school, Father Yermo Elementary, where a nun by the name of Sister Elizabeth taught him to play. He later joined a choir from San Lorenzo in Ciudad Juárez and decided to pursue music as a career. Today religious music is still one of his biggest influences. At the age of 14 he began writing songs focusing on love, and his experiences as a teenager. In 2005 he enrolled in El Paso Community College as a music major but later dropped out to focus on musical projects that he found more interesting. Career Codek was his first professional project (2007), an electro-pop duo that received national exposure. This was the first time Carreon was a singer, guitar player, and songwriter for a large project. By 2011, Carreon earned his recording engineer certification at Los Angeles Recording Connection. He soon became an intern at the Sonic Ranch recording studio, and was officially employed there in 2012.

She is regarded as the foremost interpreter of the Australian landscape in the field of ceramics. Her works are known for their intensity of colour and linear markings that interpret the artist's relationship with the Australian landscape. She was recognized as one of Western Australia’s State Living Treasures in 2015. She is Australia's highest earning ceramicist. Biography Drysdale was born in Melbourne in 1943 into a wealthy family, and grew up in Perth from the age of three. Her father, John Hastings \\"Bunny\\" Carew-Reid, was a successful businessman and real estate developer. As a teenager she had art lessons from William Boissevain. At school, she excelled at art, but struggled with other subjects due to an undiagnosed vision problem that, although eventually discovered and corrected at age 12, set her on a rebellious course during her formative years. She failed her Junior Certificate at Methodist Ladies' College, Perth. After leaving school, she attended a business college, from which she was expelled, and then a technical college, where she failed all subjects. She then worked for a short stint at her father's company as a typist, then as a secretary in Canberra, then worked odd jobs in England for a year, and traveled throughout Europe. Returning to Australia in the early 1960s, she moved to Melbourne, married Christopher Drysdale in 1967 (divorced in 1972), and had a son, Jason. In Melbourne she began selling art (Mexican paper flowers sold as \\"Pip’s Flowers\\"). She returned to Fremantle, Perth in the 1970s, and started a successful business selling herbs. Through a relationship with a potter who made ceramic structures for her herbs, Drysdale first discovered clay. That led to an Advanced Diploma in Ceramics at Western Australia School of Art and Design in 1982, followed by a 1982 trip to America where she studied with Daniel Rhodes and Toshiko Takaezu at the Anderson Ranch Art Center. Rhodes encouraged her to further her education at university level; Takaezu told her to ignore traditions and create her own sensibilities and techniques to suit her own environment. Returning to Australia, Drysdale obtained a Bachelor of Arts (Fine Art) at Curtin University in 1986. After graduating, she worked and studied at Grazia Deruta Majolica Pottery, the Artists’ Union of Russia, Tomsk State University and Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity. Career Drysdale is a painter, a colourist, whose chosen canvases are ceramics. She draws inspiration from the landscapes of Australia’s vast desert country. Places that inspire her include the Pilbara, the Eastern Goldfields-Esperance area, the Kimberley and Tanami Desert, as well as landscapes in Pakistan, India, Russia and Italy. She is stimulated by the colours and textures of landscape, putting her emotional interpretations into her work. Drysdale has taught ceramic art in Australia, Canada, UK, Italy and Russia. In 2007 she was awarded a Master of Craft, from Craft Australia, New South Wales and in 2015 the Government of Western Australia conferred on her the Living Treasure Award. Early career Drysdale went from an initial period of throwing bowls to making slab plates that she used as canvases for expressionistic drawing with coloured slips, glazes, and resists. She cites Willem de Kooning as an early influence. Her early work is notable for eschewing the \\"brown sauce\\" that often douses craft pottery in favour of \\"complex colours and nervous decoration\\". Maturity Moving from slab plates to thrown vessels, Drysdale still retained her spontaneous style of decoration. She likes pure, simple forms where the forms do not intrude on the canvas-like aspects of the vessel. After residencies in Europe, the USA and Russia, during which she learned about majolica decoration and lustres, she produced the Totem and Carnivale series. Supported by one of many Australia Council grants awarded to her, Drysdale was able to study lustres in depth, producing the Over The Top series, full of rich gold and platinum lustres. Western Australia inspired the series Landscape Lustre (1994), Pinnacles (1995) and Eastern Goldfields. At this time Drysdale started a collaboration with master potter Warrick Palmateer, allowing her to concentrate on surface art while he threw the vessels. This glaze and lustre period reached its apogee in the Pakistan series, where multiple, liberal layers of glaze were followed each time by dousing in paraffin wax, scraping back, and filling. Late period Drysdale moved from the toxicity of waxes and lustres to the much safer Liquitex medium, which also allowed her to further refine her line work. A 1998 airplane flight Drysdale took over northern Australia stands out to her as a key turning point. Flying low over Australia's Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert, she was deeply impressed by the endless lines of parallel sand dunes stretching to the horizon, and their repetitive interplay of shadow and light. The linearity of her work also echoes the exposed rock strata everywhere to be seen in Australian deserts, so that truly \\"her ceramics are grounded in the tonal and linear patterns of the land\\". She was also influenced by indigenous painting (she owns works by indigenous artists Queenie McKenzie and Kitty Kantilla) and painter Fred Williams. McKenzie's influence can be seen in the serried, stacked segments of landscape that recede to the horizon line, and Kantilla's influence is clearly evident in the motif of parallel, slanting or vertical lines within these landscape segments. Coalescing all these influences and ideas together, Drysdale arrived at her signature style of intense colour and fine linework in the first Tanami series called Red Desert (Frankfurt, 2003), which was a great success. Her technique encompasses the selection of a suitable vessel, the adding the layers of glaze, then the careful linear incisions with a knife through a masking resist to inscribe the tracery that defines and shapes each work. Because the masking medium quickly dries into a form too hard to inscribe, Drysdale can work only on one small section at a time. The inscribed lines are then brushed out and filled with thickly applied color, and the excess color is removed. Installation of 2018 work inspired by Devils Marbles by Pippin Drysdale Another feature of Drysdale's later oeuvre are her assemblages of asymmetrical pieces, suites of closed forms that echo geological features of Australia, such as the Devils Marbles series, inspired by the Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve in the Northern Territory. Drysdale finds constant renewal of self in the creative process, dating back to her earliest contact with clay: Studio Drysdale's studio for the last 30 years has been her home in the port of Fremantle, a worker's cottage, now heavily renovated, bought for her by her father. Her pottery is thrown by Warrick Palmateer, a fellow Curtin graduate. She has a studio team of helpers to do the glaze mixing, colour testing, firing, bisque-ware sanding, internet work and shipping of work. The porcelain clay is pugged multiple times, wrapped to \\"sweat\\" for four weeks, then repugged before use. Collections Drysdale's works are found in many private collections. The 12th Duke of Devonshire, Peregrine Cavendish, has a large collection (over 100) of Drysdale's works. Her work is represented in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Powerhouse Museum, Auckland Art Gallery, Queensland Art Gallery, Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, National Museum of Scotland, Museum of Fine Arts, Gifu, Tomsk State Gallery and Museum, Novosibirsk State Art Museum, as well as in the Victoria and Albert Museum ceramic collection, London.

Yamazaki's first English-language book, a collection of short stories translated by Polly Barton, was published by Strangers Press under the title Friendship for Grown Ups in 2017. In a review for The Japan Society of the UK, Eluned Gramich noted that Yamazaki \\"seems more interested in the distance between lovers than in what unites them\\", but also called Friendship for Grown Ups \\"funny and clever\\". The Japan Times praised Yamazaki's \\"skill in evoking the ambiguity of contemporary life\\" and called the collection \\"a small book that says a lot about the way we live today\\".

Hose towers have been features of some fire station designs in the United States and Canada . The purpose of such towers was to hang and dry canvas hoses, slowing the deterioration caused if the hoses were not dried thoroughly. Fire stations can also have towers for other purposes: a clock tower or bell tower or drill tower for firemen to practice. In Australia, especially, some fire stations had watch towers for looking for smoke, presumably in relatively flat areas and in spread out low towns where an extra story or two of elevation provided for an extremely wide range of vision, perhaps 360 degrees. Before radio/telephone communications, in the U.S. and Australia and elsewhere, fire lookout towers were also sited on mountain tops or other remote locations with wide views, later, when radio/telephone communications were possible. Hose towers are features of many fire stations, perhaps especially in the U.S. A hose tower is a feature of a historic landmark in Wisconsin. In 2001, a campaign was undertaken to restore the only remaining hose tower in Oklahoma. In 2016, a hose tower mounted on top of the city hall in Sainte-Anne-de- Bellevue, Quebec, was demolished after much public debate. In Australia there are examples of fire-hose drying poles, where hoses are drawn by rope pulley up an outdoor pole, in lieu of an entire hose tower structure.

Halleck, No. 17-1702, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case related to limitations on First Amendment-based free speech placed by private operators. While the case deals with speech limited by a public access television station, questioning whether the station was a state actor or a private entity, analysts expected the case will determine if private operators' limitations on free speech on social media violate First Amendment rights. The Court ruled that the station was not considered a state actor for purposes of evaluating free speech issues in the 5-4 ruling along ideological lines..  Background  In the past, the Supreme Court has not directly ruled that public access televisions systems, which operate on leased channels provided by the government, are not considered public forums, as established by a split ruling in Denver Area Educ. Telecomms. Consortium, Inc. v. F.C.C.. In the 1970s, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandated that cable operators leave some channels for public use. However, in 1979, the Supreme Court case Federal Communications Commission v. Midwest Video Corporation ruled that the FCC did not have the authority to institute this order. In 1984, President Reagan signed the Cable Communications Policy allowing state governments to require cable operators to devote some channels for public access. Such television systems have generally been upheld as being private operators rather than a state actor, giving them the ability to limit free speech. Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN) is a public access television network run by Manhattan Community Access Corp. that serves New York City. In 2012, DeeDee Halleck and Jesus Papoleto Melendez, employees of MNN at the time, went to a MNN Board meeting but were told the meeting was private. According to Halleck, the following day Melendez was told he was not allowed in the studio. Halleck and Melendez then produced a program entitled The 1% Visit El Barriothat was critical of MNN. While their program was aired once, further airings were cancelled and the two were denied further access to the MNN premises and channel, Halleck for a year and Melendez for life. The two filed suit against MNN and the city, claiming that how MNN was set up made the public access system a public forum, and that their First Amendment rights to free speech were violated. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the case in December 2016, following arguments from the city and MNN, and following the Supreme Court's own decision from Denver Area that declined to settle whether public access systems were considered state actors. The District Court found, \\"In short, there is no clear precedent governing whether public access channels are public fora. The issue is certainly a close call.\\" On appeal to the Second Circuit, two of the three judges there ruled for Halleck and Melendez, citing Justice Anthony Kennedy's dissent in Denver Area that suggested that public access systems, since mandated by the government, should be treated as state actors, and thus cannot regulate free speech. The City was not considered to be at fault. MNN petitioned for writ of certatori in June 2018, with the Court granting the case in October 2018. It was the first case accepted by the Court following the induction of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, replacing Kennedy on the bench. While the case is directly about public access television, several analysts believe that the Court will also review how companies that control social media on the Internet would by treated under similar considerations. This was predicated on the Court's prior decision in Packingham v. North Carolina,. where the Court did rule that social media was a \\"protected space\\" for lawful speech under the First Amendment. Supreme Court On February 25, 2019, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments. The Justices' questions centered around whether the city had a property interest in MNN's channel space and what precisely New York's \\"first come, first serve\\" rule meant practically. Decision The Court delivered its 5-4 decision along ideological lines on June 17, 2019, which reversed the Second Circuit's decision and remanded the case to be reheard on its ruling. Opinion of the Court Justice Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion, finding that MNN could not be considered a state actor in how it operates, and as such, was not bound to protect free speech rights as a state actor would be expected. The Court stated that the MNN is immune to the First and Fourteenth amendments due to its status as a private company. The opinion argues that First and Fourteenth Amendments only apply to “governmental abridgment of speech” and not to “private abridgment of speech” (Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., Hudgens v. NLRB, and Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo). In order for an organization to be seen as governmental, private companies must be a state actor, meaning an organization that exercises “powers traditionally exclusive to the state”, defined from the case Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co. and the action must have been originally and solely performed by the government (Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, Evans v. Newton). In conclusion, the opinions states that even though the local government of New York City did give a contract for the MNN to operate these public access channels, since they have been operated by private cable companies from earlier times, the action of operating a public access channel does not meet the criteria of the function being originally and solely performed by the government. The opinion compares itself to cases such as Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, and Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward for broadcast licenses, liquor licences, and corporate charters respectively. Justice Kavanaugh also writes that even if a private organization creates a public forum for speech, the fact that it is a private company allows its immunity from the First and Fourteenth Amendments (Hudgens v. NLRB, Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, and Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB). An example Justice Kavanaugh gives is that private organizations such as grocery stores and comedy clubs allow public forums such as bulletin boards or open mic sessions, but only topics that are relevant to these organizations are allowed to be expressed. Dissenting opinion The dissenting opinion, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor believed that MNN “stepped into the City's shoes and thus qualifies as a state actor, subject to the First Amendment like any other.\\" Justice Sotomayor also argues that since New York City laws require that public-access channels be open to all, MNN also took responsibility for this law with the public-access channels. It did not matter whether the City or a private company runs this public forum since the City mandated that the channels be open to all. Aftermath As the decision was more limited, ruling on the status of MNN rather than whether the actions directly affecting free speech, the case is not expected to have a major impact on social media.

Originally, NM 418 was a section of U.S. Route 80 (US 80), a transcontinental highway running from San Diego, California, to Tybee Island, Georgia, but was bypassed when a new section of US 80 (now I-10) was built between the current western terminus of NM 418 and Pine Street in Deming. Route description Eastbound NM 418 heading towards Deming. NM 418 is a short highway of only between I-10 near Gage and Spruce Street in Deming. The road starts at the north fence of the I-10 right of way at the interchange of exit 68. The highway travels south for a short distance then immediately east through rural Luna County intersecting with former NM 331 at Hermanas Road. This intersection was formerly the western terminus of NM 418\\\\. NM 418 continuing east was formerly part of NM 331. At Doña Ana Road and County Road 61, NM 418 swings to the northeast. The highway then passes the western terminus of NM 427, which is known as Florida Street through Deming. NM 418 enters the urban area of Deming at the intersection of 15th Street. Through the western part of Deming, NM 418 cuts a diagonal path through several residential intersections before reaching its eastern terminus at an intersection with Spruce Street. When NM 418 was still part of US 80, the highway continued on a sweeping curve that merged into Spruce Street rather than the T shaped intersection that exists today. From there US 80 would have continued east on Spruce Street, later I-10 Business and NM 549 towards Las Cruces. History An old Texaco station, now abandoned on the side of NM 418 (former US 70 and US 80). In 1903, the New Mexico Territorial Legislative Assembly and Territorial Roads Commission established New Mexico Territorial Road 4, which became New Mexico State Road 4 in 1913. NM 4 ran from Rodeo through Lordsburg and Deming to NM 1 in Las Cruces. NM 4 was designated as part of the Dixie Overland Highway auto trail in 1917. The Dixie Overland Highway was the first marked route to run between Savannah, Georgia and southern California. The auto trail entered New Mexico through El Paso, Texas, then traveled north to Mesilla Park where it turned west to Deming, Lorsburg and Steins, before heading south into Rodeo and southwest into Arizona towards Douglas. By 1920, the Bankhead Highway also followed the majority of this route, further joined by the Old Spanish Trail in 1923. On November 11, 1926, the highway was added to the newly created U.S. Highway System as U.S. Route 80. US 80 followed much of the same routing as the previous auto trails, but turned west at Las Cruces instead of Mesilla Park. Between 1930 and 1931, the highway between Deming and Gage was rebuilt onto a straighter diagonally shaped alignment, which remains the path NM 418 takes today. The original 90 degree shape the route took is now part of Doňa Ana Road and 8th Street. In 1935, US 70 was extended west from Clovis to Los Angeles, California, becoming concurrent with US 80 between Las Cruces and Lordsburg. US 70 and US 80 would continue to use this alignment well into the 1950s. By 1956, US 70 and US 80 were placed on a new alignment further north. The new alignment was later rebuilt into a section of Interstate 10 between Gage and Pine Street in Deming. In 1989, US 80 was decommissioned from most of New Mexico. The remainder of the highway was removed from the state in 1991. US 70 on the other hand was never removed from New Mexico and still runs through Las Cruces, Deming and Lordsburg to Arizona. The bypassed 1931 route was at first re-designated as the entirety of NM 418 and a northern extension of NM 331\\\\. NM 418 originally ran from US 70/US 80 (later I-10) to an intersection with NM 331\\\\. The remainder of the route to Deming was served by NM 331. By 1996, NM 331 had been truncated to its junction with NM 418 while the latter route had been extended along the former route of NM 331 to Spruce Street in Deming.

History The park was constructed in 1896 by subscriptions during the magistracy of Beatson Bell to celebrate the visit of Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. At that time, it was laid out in the open space between the civil lines and the riverside road. Kirtankhola river used to be located just beside the park and many palm trees were planted across the road. The park was named after Beatson Bell to recognize his contribution to the city development, Muslim education and public health of Barisal people. Tha park has been the principal playground of the city for decades and is the center of all sports and athletic activities. It has been also used for huge public meeting where Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Ziaur Rahman, Hussain Muhammad Ershad, Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia and other national leaders came and gave a speech to people. It also hosts many other social and cultural events yearly. The park was renamed as Bangabandhu Udyan in 1996 by the ruling party and a stage and Bangabandhu mural was built in memory of his first visit to Barisal to join the public meeting there in 1972. In 2011, Shawkat Hossain Hiron, former mayor of the city, took initiatives for the significant development and beautification of the park.

He came from the same village as Zhu Yuanzhang and joined Guo Zixing's Red Turban Rebellion, a millenarian sect related to the White Lotus Society, at the time of its original uprising, in March 1352. Tang was promoted quickly in rank as Guo's army grew. After conquering Jiqing (present-day Nanjing) City and Zhenjiang City, which was under the command of Zhu Yuanzhang, he was promoted to Yuan Shuai (wing commander), and after conquering Changzhou in April 1357, Tang was placed in command there with the rank of deputy assistant chief of the commission of military affairs. In 1367, he was sent south to defeat Fang Guozhen's and Chen Youding's forces, and then campaigned in Shanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia under the command of Xu Da. He was granted the title Duke Xingguo. Tang He died in August 1395, one of the few founding generals of the Ming dynasty who had a natural death.  Early life  Tang was born into a desperately poor farming family in Zhongli Village, which is in present-day Fengyang, Anhui Province. He and Zhu Yuangzhang were friends in childhood, and Tang later became one of the closest associates and the principal general of Zhu. Tang had shown his ambition and talent as a militarist since childhood. He would like to be a leader amount partners, and preferred practicing riding and arching at very young age. After growing up, Tang became a calm, strong, confident, and well- spoken man that could be an outstanding militarist.  Military career   Early career  In 1352, because of the natural disaster and the Yuan dynasty's incompetent governing, a rebellious group named the Red Turbans rose. It signaled the beginning of the end of Mongol rule over China. Tang joined the rebellion with several other ambitious young men, and invited Zhu Yuanzhang, who became a novice monk at the Huangjue Temple, to the Red Turbans. Zhu accepted this invitation; after that, he was soon granted a position higher than Tang for his contributions. Early in 1354, Tang was selected by Zhu Yuangzhang, then Guo's protege, to be one of twenty-four men to serve as the core of his personal command. After Zhu's capture of Chuzhou in April, he received the rank of battalion commander. Tang served under Zhu in the invasion of Dahongshan in year 1353, and they conquered Chuzhou and Hezhou together. Tang was the only one who strongly supported Zhu when Zhu's authority was contested by the other generals at Hezhou in 1355. Later in the same year, Tang together with other generals conquered Lishui and Jurong under the command of Zhu. In the storming of Taiping, against Cheng Yexian, Tang was wounded by an arrow on the left leg. Though he was seriously injured, Tang persisted in the battle and finally caught Cheng alive. In year 1356, serving under Xu Da, Tang took part in the conquering of Jiqing (present-day Nanjing), which became the base of Zhu's operation and the capital of the Ming dynasty. Soon after, Tang and Xu Da conquered Zhenjiang and Changzhou. Following these successes, Tang was promoted to Yuan Shuai(wing commander), and he was placed in Changzhou with the rank of deputy assistant chief of Shumiyuan (Commission of Military Affairs).  Defense of Changzhou  Changzhou was the most important of several cities controlled by Zhu Yuanzhang, which constituted the line of defense against the kingdom of Zhang Shicheng, who declared himself as King of Wu and was Zhu's enemy. Tang He and his large garrison had to defend the city and act as a mobile reserve to help other cities when they were threatened. Zhang sent spies rapidly to get information, but their all failed, attributing to Tang's effective commands. Zhang also invaded the city several times, while Tang beat off one attack in February 1358, and in May 1359, Tang captured over one thousand men and forty ships by an ambush. Tang did not participate in the battle against Chen Yuliang, because he was ordered to act occasional counterattacks against Zhang Shicheng's territories. In February 1363, he was promoted to junior administrator of the secretariat; then, in April 1364, becoming chief administrator.  War against Zhang Shicheng  Finally, Zhu's main army returned to Nanjing after defeating Chen, and Tang's troops were permitted to go to other areas. Tang was soon granted the title of left censoring-chief for defeating Zhang's army utterly in the invasion of Wuxi, and was granted as \\"Pin Zhang Zhen Shi\\"(a prestigious title) after victory over Zhang's navy in the area of Huangyang Mountain. Later in December 1364, Tang relieved Changxing from Zhang Shixin's (Zhang Shicheng's brother) siege, and captured eight thousand soldiers alive in the hard-fought battle. In October 1365, Tang joined the final battle against Zhang Shicheng under the command of Xu Da. Tang quickly destroyed Zhang's navy in Lake Tai and Wujiang, and rejoined the main army that besieged Suzhou. In the fight in Chang Men (part of Suzhou), Tang was once more wounded. He returned to Nanjing to convalesce, but was back soon for the invasion of Suzhou in October, 1367. Tang was granted a great reward by Zhu after the battle, and was given the nominal title of instructor to the heir apparent in February of the following year.  Conquest of Fujian  In 1365, Zhu declared himself as King of Wu. After the collapse of their last great enemy, Zhang, Tang was put in charge of the southern expedition with Wu Zhen as his deputy, and ordered to lead the former garrisons of Jiangzhou, Jiangxing, and Jiangyin to suppress Fang Guozhen. Tang conquered Yuyao, Shangyu, and Qinyuan successfully at the end of November, but Fang escaped over the sea, with the loss of only few units. Zhu Yuanzhang then ordered Liao Yuanzhong to support Tang with his own ships. The combined force pursued Fang's navy. At the end of December, Fang surrendered his four hundred ships and twenty-four thousand men. At the same time that Xu Da conquered northern China, Zhu's army was invading Fujian overland from the west. In support, Tang He and Liao Yuanzhong sailed to Fuzhou in January. Tang occupied the port after a short siege, and this led the coastal cities, including Xinhua, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, to surrender soon afterward. The expeditionary force then pushed up along the river, capturing pro-Yuan warlord Chen Yuting alive. This completed the campaign in Fujian, and would be Tang's greatest military achievement. In March 1366, Tang returned to Ningbo to transport grain by sea to the north with Fang Guozhen's former staff, and put Liao in command of the fleet.  Conquest of North and West China  Tang accompanied the emperor to Kaifeng in August 1368. There, he was assigned a mission of conquering cities in northern Henan and southern Shanxi. After completing his mission, Tang joined Zhu's main army under Xu Da, and together they entered Shanxi in year 1369. The battle ended in September, and soon after, both Tang He and Xu Da were recalled to Nanjing to receive rewards from the emperor. However, because Tang had offended the emperor once in Changzhou after drinking, he received a lesser reward than the principals. A few weeks later, Tang became Xu Da's deputy for the northern conquest, and was present in the great victory over Köke Temür(also known as Wang Baobao) at Gansu; afterwards Tang was detached from the main army and sent north. He conquered Xingxia and Ordos region, taking tens of thousand of livestock. His army stayed at the upper bend of Yellow River until the end of the year, when Tang and several other generals were recalled to Nanjing to a ceremony and to receive noble titles from the emperor. This time, Tang was given title of Marquis of Zhongshan, with annual salary of 1500 Shi. He was ranked seventh among Ming's nobility and first among marquis of that day. In February 1371, two armies, one land and one navy, were sent to Sichuan to conquer the state of Xia. Tang was put on overall command of the navy, with Liao Yuanzhong and Zhou Dexing as his deputies. His mission was to pass the gorges to Chongqing. However, Tang could not find a way past the gorges when the land force commanded by Fu Youde was pushing forward in progress, and Tang lost faith after several battles. Eventually, Liao Yuanzhong, whose entire career had been on water, found a way to break through with his own fleet, and the whole navy was able to continue upstream. Chongqing fell early in August, while Chengdu also surrendered in the same month. When Tang returned to the emperor in November, the emperor judged the reward of this campaign belongs to Liao Yuanzhong and Fu Youde, because of Tang's insufficient performance.  Defence against Mongols  In 1372, Tang commanded one of the armies against the Mongols in the north, and on 10 August, at Duantou Mountain, he suffered a severe defeat. Only two months later, Xu Da's main army was defeated by Köke Temür. After this, the emperor decided to set a defensive posture in the north. Tang himself was not punished for this loss, and in April of the following year, he was put in charge of an army on the northern frontier. During the next two years, Tang supervised the training of troops, founding of military colonies, and the repair of walls of Beiping and Zhangde. At the end of 1374, Tang was called back to Nanjing for a while, but in February 1375, he returned to the military colonies in Shanxi. The death of Köke Temür in the same year reduce the pressure of the northern frontier for a while, but soon Boyan Temür took his place as leader of the Mongols and invaded Shanxi. Since the beginning of 1376, Tang, with Fu Youde and several other generals, stayed in Shanxi and resisted invasion from the Mongols for almost two years, until Boyan Temür left the region.  End of the career  In February 1378, Tang He was made the Duke of Xinguo. For the following two years, Tang led the training of troops in the northwestern region. At the beginning of 1381, Tang, as a deputy of Xu Da, achieved great success in the campaign against Mongols, and he remained in the newly occupied region for the following years. Then in year 1383, Tang was sent to command the army in Yong Ning, Sichuan, and the next year he inspected troops and military colonies in Fujian and Zhejiang in order to improve the defense against Japanese pirates (Wokou). In year 1385, the emperor sent his sixth son, the king of Chu, Zhu Zhen, to suppress the rebellion in Guizhou known as the Wumian peasant revolt. Tang was sent as the nominal adviser for the prince, and also as the actual commander. After a hard-fought campaign, Tang captured forty thousand rebels and pacified the province in few months. After returning to the capital in February, 1386, Tang asked the emperor's permission to retire. Though impressed by his plea, Zhu Yuan Zhang thought Tang was still vigorous and assigned him a lighter mission to supervise the coast defenses in Zhejiang. In July 1388, Tang again submitted a request, which was approved. The emperor sent him off with generous rewards.  Later years and evaluation  On New Year's Day of 1390, Tang lost his voice after suffering a stroke, and he only made rare public appearances thereafter. His health condition worsened during the following years. Eventually, Tang He died on 7 July 1395 at the age of sixty-nine. Tang was posthumously granted as prince of Dongwa, and given the name Duke Xinguo. Though irritating the emperor once and could only be adjudged as a mediocre commander, Tang retained Zhu Yuanzhang's favor to the end. The trust he gained from the emperor was based on the good friendship at childhood, and constantly support he gave at the time Zhu was challenged. This trust continued after 1380, because Tang was willing to give up his command at the time when Zhu was centralizing his military power. Tang was an example of a peasant who rose to power and fame at the beginning of Ming dynasty.  Family  Tang He had five sons. The oldest, Tang Li, later reached the rank of vice commissioner in chief, but the dukedom was terminated. In 1492, the emperor, Zhu Youtang, appointed Tang's descendant in the sixth generation, Tang Shaozong, as the chief of embroidered uniform guard in Nanjing. His lineage received a hereditary title of marquis of Lingbi, and an annual salary of 1000 Shi that was inherited to the end of Ming dynasty. Tang He also had five daughters, the eldest become the concubine of Zhu Yuanzhang's tenth son, Zhu Tan, and her sister took her place in August 1387 after her death.

The singular form of the name, Al Ketbi, is a common family name in the Northern UAE today. Consisting of a settled southern section and a nomadic northern section, the tribe was long influential in the conduct of affairs in the interior of the Trucial States. The Northern branch mostly settled in the inland towns of Dhaid and Al Falayah.  Settlement  The tribe consisted, at the turn of the 19th century, of some 2,100 nomadic Bedouin (of whom some 600 were fighting men) and 2,700 settled people. The Bedouin dar, or district, of the Bani Qitab stretched from South of the Buraimi oasis to the Eastern foothills of the Hajar Mountains, the Jiri plain to the North of Sharjah and the fertile area around Sharjah's inland oasis town of Dhaid. The Southern Bani Qitab, some 500 households, settled around the village of Aflaj Bani Qitab in the Dhahirah area. Over time these separated from the Northern section of the tribe and in the 20th century Dhahirah became recognised as a governorate of Oman.  Political influence  The Bani Qitab was a highly influential tribe and often involved in political jostling between the Trucial Rulers – one example of this being the dispute in 1905 over the Wadi Hatta. The village next to Hatta, Masfout, was traditionally home to the Na'im tribe, who were originally from Buraimi. They found themselves under threat when the Bani Qitab built a fort at Wadi Hatta and started to harass caravans passing through the pass to the Omani Batina coast. Appealing to Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, and following a meeting of the Trucial Sheikhs in Dubai in April of that year, the Na'im gained Zayed's support against the Sheikh of Umm Al Qawain, Sheikh Rashid bin Ahmad Al Mualla, who was a staunch supporter of the Bani Qitab in this and other disputes. That loyalty was repaid when Rashid bin Ahmad died suddenly of pneumonia in 1922. The Bani Qitab, under Sheikh Muhammed bin Ali Al Huwaidan, were instrumental in ensuring the smooth succession of the Ruler of Umm Al Qawain, Sheikh Abdulla bin Rashid Al Mualla II, on his father's death. The young sheikh, fearful of the intentions of his uncles and other family members, secured the town with the help of 100 Bani Qitab men. It was also Sheikh Muhammed bin Ali Al Huwaidan who obtained an allowance from the Ruler of Sharjah of 2,500 Rupees.  Support for Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi  The 1920s, in particular, saw fighting break out across the interior, with Bani Qitab never far from the action. They were involved in tribal fighting in Buraimi as well as raids and counter-raids that stretched as far as Al Falayah in the North (itself home to a number of Bani Qitab), with the Awamir, Duru, Manasir and Bani Yas all drawn into a complicated series of conflicts which, by 1925, brought the Rulers of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah together to try and broker a peace. The tribe was once again embroiled in conflict when the Ruler of Sharjah, Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi, was deposed in 1924, siding with Khalid against the new Ruler, Sultan, but joining in with Sultan in Sharjah's 1933 war with Ajman because of the influence of Abdulrahman of Heerah. Supporting Khalid bin Ahmad again in 1937, the Bani Qitab paid a key role in his accession as Ruler of Kalba. Effectively in control of the interior of the Northern emirates, the tribe was courted by various Rulers over the granting of access to oil companies who had obtained concessions. Even in the 1940s, the Bani Qitab force of 200 to 250 armed, mounted Bedouin was a decisive force.

At 689.9 meters, it is the longest stone bridge over the sea in the world.  History  The Obelisk The closed bridge shortly before the restoration When the Republic of the Ionian Islands was under British patronage, part of the occupation costs were reimbursed in the form of infrastructure projects. The Swiss engineer Charles de Bosset became island governor in 1810http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=57931 and put the emphasis of his activity on the road and bridge construction. Numerous connections were shortened with bridges over ravines. The biggest project, however, was the bridge over the Bay of Argostoli to Drapano, which shortened the way to Lixouri and the north of the island. It separates the Koutavos lagoon from the bay. In 1812 De Bosset presented his idea of a bridge to the island council, which had to confirm the construction. Counterargument was that the bridge could give robbers a slight escape route, since its northern end is (then as today) unpopulated. In a meeting De Bosset struck a sword on the table and proclaimed that if necessary he could cut treaties with a sword.Patsch: Die Insel Leukas. Eine geographische Monographie, Ausg. 95-100, P. 86. 1890 First made of wood, the construction was replaced immediately after construction piece by piece by a bridge of sandstone. The bridge pavement is loaded on 16 low stone arches, one of them is filled. On a small man-made island along the bridge is an obelisk monument of British patronage. During the 1953 Ionian earthquake parts of the bridge subsided, after backfilling and straightening of the pavement these damages remain visible from the side until today. In 1970, the bridge was listed as a historical monument.PI. Papayianni, V. Pachta, A.

As the bridge ends relatively centrally in Argostoli, its utility has recently proven to be counterproductive to keeping the through traffic out of the city, successively the bridge was closed in 2009 for heavy goods traffic and then for cars. In 2005, the seismic safety of the bridge was controlled, and an exchange of concrete fillings by sandstone was recommended. From 2011 to 2013, the bridge was renovated and re-opened as a pedestrian bridge. In the course of the restoration, the concrete fillings from 1953 were replaced by sandstone, the asphalt was replaced by paving and the light poles anchored in the sea were replaced by replicas of the original lanterns.

When the highway was realigned in 1956, Cambray slowly fell into decline and became a ghost town. History Cambray was established in 1892, the Southern Pacific Railroad drilled a well to create a water stop. The location was recognized by the United States Postal Service as a mailing destination in 1893. The main automobile route through Cambray was originally part of State Road 4. In 1917, the Dixie Overland Highway, a transcontinental auto trail, was established over Route 4 through Cambray and became the main highway between Deming and El Paso, Texas. The Bankhead Highway was added to the route in 1920, followed by the Old Spanish Trail in 1923. On November 11, 1926, the highway was added to the newly created U.S. Highway System as U.S. Route 80. Cambray would enjoy a short but successful second life as a stop along new US 80 and US 70 when the latter highway was also designated over the route. During the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed a highway overpass over the Southern Pacific Railroad and built several irrigation canals as part of the New Deal program. The CCC workers were housed in an auto court on the side of US 80 in Cambray and did most of their business at the town's general store. During the mid 20th Century, Cambray enjoyed a peak population of 75 residents. The end of the small town's success arrived in 1956, when US 70 and US 80 were re-aligned onto a new highway bypassing Cambray. Today, the newer route is part of Interstate 10. The population fell to a single family and the roadside businesses closed. Many of the abandoned buildings fell into disrepair as Cambray became a ghost town. The only dedicated road serving Cambray is still the former route of US 70 and US 80, now New Mexico State Road 549.

The tribe is also present in other gulf countries. The Na'im is divided into three sections, the Al Bu Kharaiban, the Khawatir and the Al Bu Shamis (singular Al Shamsi). It is from the former section that the current Rulers of the Emirate of Ajman are drawn. Of the three sections, the Al Bu Shamis has become virtually independent and associated closely with the Al Bu Falah of Dubai. The traditional heart of Na'im territory was the oasis town of Buraimi and nearby Al Ain, where Na'im expansion came at the expense of the Dhawahir tribe, but also rubbed up against the Bani Yas and the allied Manasir. Although the Na'im were linked to the growing Wahhabi influence in the Buraimi area and adopted the doctrine, they allied with other forces to evict the Wahhabis from Buraimi and subsequently occupied many of the forts around Buraimi.  Origins  In 1818, according to the 'British Assistant Political Agent in Turkish Arabia', Captain Robert Taylor, the Na'im numbered some 20,000 men in Buraimi and 400 in Ajman. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Na'im were spread across much of the area of the modern-day UAE, with families settled in Ajman, Dhaid, Hamriyah, Sharjah, Hafit, Heerah and Ras Al Khaimah. Some 5,500 Na'im at the time lived in and around the Buraimi oasis. A further 660 houses of Na'im were located at Dhank, in Dhahirah, Oman. At the time, the Na'im were mostly settled in towns or in pastoral communities, although the Khawatir were Bedouins, roaming a dar consisting of the Jiri plain and the Hafit area with 800 camels, 1,500 sheep and goats and some 100 cattle.  Masfout  The Fort at Masfout Masfout, a mountainous village in the Wadi Hatta, had long been home to the Na'im. They found themselves under threat in 1905 when the Bani Qitab built a fort in the wadi and started to harass caravans passing through the pass to the Omani Batina coast. Appealing to Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyah of Abu Dhabi, and following a meeting of the Trucial Sheikhs in Dubai in April of that year, they gained Zayed's support (against the Sheikh of Umm Al Qawain, who supported the Bani Qitab) and retained Masfout. The Na'imi of Masfout were in almost constant conflict with the people of Hajarain, which later became a dependency of Dubai known as Hatta. However, they considered themselves independent of the Rulers of Ajman. In 1948, Masfout was seized from its Na'imi Sheikh, Saqr bin Sultan Al Hamouda, by Sheikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi III of Ajman, when Hamouda was unable to raise a force of men to oppose Rashid. Masfout has been part of the Emirate of Ajman since, albeit an exclave. A period of uncertainty followed as the various Sheikhs of the region attempted to jostle for influence in order to sign petroleum concessions, with the Sultan in Muscat and the Saudis paying tribute to the Na'im in Buraimi and other local tribes in the area in return for fealty which often turned out to be short-lived. This activity among the rulers and tribes eventually led to the Buraimi Dispute. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the Na'im were arguably the dominant force in the area West of the Hajar Mountains, with some 13,000 members and the ability to raise at least 2,000 fighting men. By the 1940s, this had dropped to just 300–400 rifles and the tribe was split into factions. Competition for grazing and other resources often spilled over into conflict between the tribes and the Na'im were often involved in disputes and open warfare with other tribes, including the Bani Ka'ab, Bani Qitab and Al Bu Falah. However, the Al Bu Shamis remained generally on good terms with other tribes, particularly the Duru and Bani Qitab. With the continuing decline of the Na'im tribal federation, the Al Bu Shamis maintained an almost completely separate identity and, in fact, the Al Bu Shamis leader of Al Heera – Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Muhammad Al Shamsi was often at loggerheads, if not war, with the Ruler of Ajman.  Bahrain  The Na'im was one of the several bedouin tribes to move to Bahrain in 1783 after the Al Khalifa conquered the island.  Qatar  The tribe were reported as being one of the most powerful tribes in Qatar in an 1890 report by the British government. In J.G. Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf published in 1904, he described the Na'im as \\"a Bedouin tribe who grazed their cattle on pastures surrounding Zubarah in 1873.\\" He stated that 60 or 70 of the tribe's branch in Qatar had a hereditary attachment to the Bahraini emir.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Baker, to the west. Mount Thompson is situated east of the Wapta Icefield, and is a member of the Waputik Mountains. Mount Thompson can be seen from the Icefields Parkway at Bow Lake.  History Mount Thompson is named for Charles Sproull Thompson (1869-1921) who participated in numerous first ascents in the Canadian Rockies. In August of 1897, Charles Thompson, Hugh Stutfield, and J. Norman Collie camped on the shores of Bow Lake; then proceeded to climb the Bow Glacier, which at that time descended farther down into the valley; then crossed the Wapta Icefield to attain the summit of Mount Gordon. From Mount Gordon they were surrounded by unnamed mountains and named one of them Mount Thompson. The first ascent of Mount Thompson was made the following year (1898), by Norman Collie, Hugh Stutfield, and Herman Woolley. The mountain's name became official in 1928 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Charles Thompson named Portal Peak which is a subsidiary peak located 1.5 km southeast of his peak. Portal Peak flanks one side of Bow Glacier, which in 1897 was considered the portal to the Wapta Icefield. Geology Mount Thompson is an overthrust peak situated between the Bow Glacier and Peyto Glacier. Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Thompson is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Thompson is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 °C with wind chill factors below -30 °C. Precipitation runoff from Mount Thompson drains into the Bow River which is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River.

A network of banks, stock traders, and lawyers had obtained billions from European treasuries through suspected fraud and speculation involving dividend taxes. The five hardest hit countries may have lost at least $62.9 billion. Germany is the hardest hit country, with around $36.2 billion withdrawn from the German treasury. Estimated losses for other countries include at least €17 billion for France, €4.5 billion in Italy, €1.7 billion in Denmark and €201 million for Belgium.  Method  The network stole several billion Euros from the treasury, through what Correctiv calls a \\"cum-ex\\" trade: The participants in the network would lend each other shares in large companies, so that to tax authorities there would appear to be two owners of the shares, when there was only one. The bank that was used in stock trading would then issue a \\"confirmation\\" to the investor that tax on the dividend payment had been paid, without it being done. \\"It’s a bit like parents claiming a child benefit for two – or more – children when there is only one child in the family.\\" writes Correctiv. This practice was outlawed in 2012. The name \\"cum-ex\\" is derived from Latin, meaning \\"with without\\", and refers to the disappearing nature of the fraudulent dividend payments. In cum- ex trades, shares with and without dividend rights were quickly traded between various market participants just before the payout date for the dividend, allowing traders to reclaim double the taxes. Financial institutions in essence exploited a legal loophole which allowed two parties to simultaneously claim ownership of the same shares, therefore allowing both to claim tax rebates to which they were not entitled. Authorities have since deemed the reclaims illegitimate, but at the time of the trades, this was less black and white, and a vast network of traders, analysts and lawyers were thought to be involved in the practice throughout the continent. The elite tax firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer gave tax advice which was used to justify the legality of the scheme. In November 2019, Ulf Johannemann, a former Freshfield lawyer was arrested. In May 2020, the European Banking Authority announced a 10-point action plan to enhance the future regulatory framework surrounding dividend arbitrage trading schemes. According to the report, in some countries, the cum ex deals are not criminal offences. Danish dividend scandal In 2010, in an audit report, the Danish Ministry of Taxation was found to have ignored warnings on multiple occasions of a legal tax loophole concerning dividend tax. In June 2020, it was reported by investigators that such transactions took advantage of European rules on the taxing of dividends, which made it possible to get refunds by using a combination of short sales and future transactions.  Discovery  The Danish State Commissioner August Schäfer first warned of the practice in 1992, after the testimony of five whistleblowers. However, the practice remained widespread until an administrative assistant in the German Federal Central Tax Office noticed abnormally large tax rebate claims from a US pension fund.

She designed the coats of arms for the Israeli cities of Haifa and Holon. Biography Esther Else Joel was born on March 2, 1895 in Hamburg, Germany. Joel was greatly interested in the arts and between 1915–1920 she went to study at the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg. After completion of her studies she moved to Berlin in 1920. While in Berlin she studied arts with Alexander Archipenko and Ludwig Meidner at the Berlin University of the Arts. Berlin-Joel had her first personal exhibition in 1925, in Hamburg. In 1922 Esther married Dr. Haim Berlin, and their son Dan was born in 1923. At the end of 1925, the family immigrated to Mandatory Palestine and settled in Tel Aviv. In 1930, Haim Berlin and Esther divorced, and she continued to publish under the name E. Berlin-Joel. Following the movement for Hebraization of surnames, Esther changed her last name to Berli-Joel. Berli- Joel was a prolific graphic designer and artist, she had many exhibitions, including 12 solo exhibitions. She designed many posters, coat of arms and emblems. Berli-Joel also published several books showing her collective works. In 1936, she received first prize for her book of paintings about Haifa. Esther Berlin-Joel died on March 7, 1972 and is buried in Haifa, Israel. Coats of arms Berlin-Joel designed the coats of arms of many organizations. She was also approached to design the coat of arms for Holon and Haifa and suggested options for the Jerusalem coat of arms. The city of Holon, Israel, coat of Arms designed by E. Berlin Joel Haifa coat of arms The city of Haifa coat of arms In early 1934, Hassan Bey Shukri, mayor of Haifa, started the process of selecting a coat of arms for the city. In July 1935, an external committee decided on a competition with a prize of 15 Palestine pounds. By 1936, the committee, comprising with additional judges including an artist, architect and an engineer, couldn't find a winner, but was impressed with the designs suggested by Esther Berlin-Joel. The committee decided to ask Berlin-Joel to finish the design, with specific guidelines provided. Berlin-Joel designed several swatches, combining Mount Carmel and the sea. On April 22, 1936 the committee convened for the final time to select the design and approve. The Haifa coat of arms was approved by June 1936.Goren, Tamir, \\"History of the Haifa coat of arms\\" (Hebrew) Newsletter of the association of the history of Haifa, Vol 1 January 2004 Ilan, Alon, \\"Another glimpse into the Haifa coat of arms\\" (Hebrew) Newsletter of the association of the history of Haifa, Vol. 4 November 2006 Jerusalem coat of arms In 1943, Berli-Joel approached Mustafa al-Khalidi, mayor of Jerusalem and provided several suggestions for the City of Jerusalem's coat of arms. The city hall adopted one of Berli-Joel's suggestions on May 20, 1943, but required the approval of the College of Arms. Due to the conditions during World War II, this approval was delayed. Following the death of al-Khalidi in 1944, and disagreements within city fractions for a rotation of Arab-Jewish mayors, the British High Commissioner disbanded the council and appointed an all-British council starting on July 11, 1945.It's sad to be the mayor of Jerusalem The discussion on the coat of arms was archived.

Charlebois worked in the missions first in the nation's northwest and was noted for his extensive travels across Saskatchewan to visit isolated minorities in order to teach them catechism and to minister to those who were open to converting to the faith. His appointment as a bishop allowed him greater freedom as he was able to build new chapels and schools across his apostolic vicariate which he divided into three for greater management. Charlebois was considered a pioneer for his dedication and contribution to education and infrastructure in his apostolic vicariate where he established chapels and schools. He taught catechism on a regular basis in the various schools that he visited and also established a newspaper in order to better connect the more isolated communities. The beatification process for the late prelate launched in the 1950s and he became titled as a Servant of God. It remained inactive until it was re-launched in the late 1970s thus allowing for it to continue. Pope Francis titled him as Venerable on 28 November 2019. Life Ovide Charlebois was born in Oka on 17 February 1862 as the seventh of fourteen children to the poor Hyacinthe Charlebois and Émérente Chartier- Robert; he was baptized after his birth as \\"William-Ovide\\". He moved soon after his birth to Saint-Benoît in Mirabel and then in 1864 settled in Sainte- Marguerite-du-Lac-Masson just outside of Terrebonne. From 1876 until 1882 he attended the Collège de l'Assomption before he entered the Marian Oblate novitiate in Lachine in Montreal. He made his initial profession in 1883 and then began his theological and philosophical studies at both the College of Ottawa and the Saint-Joseph Scholasticae. Charlebois made his solemn profession into the order in 1884 before receiving the tonsure in 1886. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 17 July 1887 from Bishop Vital- Justin Grandin in Ottawa. His assignment to the missions first started on 2 September 1887 upon being sent for the first time to Le Pas where he would work at Cumberland House. Charlebois expressed his willingness to go there to minister but indicated his fear of being alone and in complete isolation. In 1890 he established a school where he would teach catechism to children. He returned to Le Pas a short while later in order to minister to those indigenous and Métis populations who expressed an interest in the faith at a time when the population in that particular area was less than one hundred people; he also ministered to these populations that were dispersed thus requiring him to travel on a regular basis in order to reach these isolated communities. In the 1900-01 winter period he estimated that he travelled 3000 miles via dogsled and snowshoe and camped outside in the now at least 35 times. His mission in Saskatchewan ended in 1903 at which point he became the director for the Industrial School at Lac Aux Canards; he remained in this position until 1920 which also happened to span during his time as a bishop. He also - in 1903 - became the principal for Saint Michael's Indian Residential School at Duck Lake where he taught catechism and also among the Cree population. He also made it an objective to reduce the school's debt which he managed to achieve. In Duck Lake he founded a French-language newspaper to serve the isolated communities in order to better connect them to each other and began planning for this in December 1908. The paper Le Patriote de l'Ouest was launched in August 1910 but resumed publication in June 1911 after a fire ruined the printing equipment in November 1910. His activities in providing additional infrastructure for the people saw him build the Le Pas mission house in 1897 in addition to a little log cabin that was to serve as a chapel. This work took him around two weeks to complete with wood he was able to get from further north. He slept in his attic - which was quite small - from its construction until 1911 as he did his work in the missions. In 1907 discussions were held about establishing an apostolic vicariate and Archbishop Louis Langevin put his name forward to be made its first bishop. Charlebois was named the first Apostolic Vicar for Keewatin on 8 August 1910 in addition to being named as the Titular Bishop of Berenice. Charlebois received his episcopal consecration on 30 November 1910 in L'Assomption from Archbishop Langevin (he was installed in his new see on 7 March 1911); the principal co- consecrators were Bishops Joseph Alfred Archambault and Alexis-Xyste Bernard. He began his first pastoral visit in his episcopate in May 1911 (this would last five months in total) and would travel on foot in addition to rail and wagon though on occasion needed to travel via a canoe in order to reach areas that were often difficult to enter or traverse. He often had to go through forested areas and would sleep on the ground in a small canvas tent during his travels. In 1911 a residence was constructed that was to become the episcopal residence but he loaned it instead to some nuns so that their order could run the first hospital in that area. He lived in its basement until the formal episcopal residence was constructed in 1927. In 1915 he split the vicariate into three districts each under the direction of a superior in order for better management of the vicariate overall. In 1923 he travelled 1000 miles via canoe and walked 80 miles during his travels in addition to having slept 23 nights in the open. In 1925 he organized the first ecclesial missions located at Hudson Bay. He also authorized a mission at Eskimo Point in Arviat in 1925. His boat twice almost capsized in Lake Winnipeg in 1927 while he was returning from a month-long visit to the missions in Norway House and Cross Lake. Towards the end of his life he became obsessed with condemning communism. In 1933 he was attending a general meeting of the national bishops in Québec when he became ill. He was taken to hospital as soon as he returned to Le Pas and died there on 20 November. He requested that he be given a pauper's burial and his own coffin cost $40. His remains were transferred to the Notre-Dame du Sacré-Coeur cathedral in 1955. The elders would recount that upon his burial a flock of doves were observed taking flight. His nephew Martin Joseph-Honoré Lajeunesse (who was his coadjutor) succeeded him as apostolic vicar for the see. Beatification process The beatification process for the late prelate launched on 15 August 1951 and concluded on 25 August 1952; the cause remained inactive until 13 April 1978 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) decree. The second process to investigate the prelate's life and saintliness opened on 16 September 1979 and closed sometime later at which stage the C.C.S. validated the two previous processes in Rome on 6 June 1986 as having complied with their rules for conducting these processes. The official Positio dossier was submitted to the C.C.S. on 28 April 2001. Pope Francis titled Charlebois as Venerable on 28 November 2019. The current postulator for this cause is the Marian Oblate priest Thomas Klosterkamp.

Animation on the episodes was done by Atomic Cartoons, a Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada-based studio,https://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/passion-pictures-teams-up-with-disney- for-101-dalmatian-street-171852.html while a number of shorts starring the characters were produced by Gigglebug. All of the episodes and shorts together are animated with the Toon Boom Animation software. A total of 26 half-hours of 52 11-minute episodes have been made as a part of the first season, with five two-parters (four specials and one clipshow with the online shorts). The creators claimed at the Annecy film festival that they purposefully never watched the direct-to-video sequel, live-action movies or the original series, and only watched the original movie. They often had to cheat when it came down to keeping up with 99 dogs, so there are some shots where the number of puppies go way beyond 101. The series is directed by Miklos Weigert. Episodes without him directing have episodic directors, the ones being Jez Hall (directing episodes 19–24, 27–31, 33, 37, 41, 43, 45 and 49–50), Frédéric Martin (directing episodes 25–26, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46 and 51–52) and Joonas Utti (directing episodes 47–48). Maria O'Loughlin is the head writer. Cara Speller serves as the executive producer. A second season for the series was also planned by the crew members,https://disneytvanimation.com/post/182258540193/101-dalmatian-street- renewed-for-a-second-season but has not been confirmed by Disney at this time. Episodes Shorts Gigglebug Guarantee (2018–19) As a part of the first season, there has been a total of ten shorts made. They were released worldwide, but only 6 were released in the UK so far. The last four shorts though are currently seen on the two-part clipshow \\"Puppy Dreams\\". Animals vs. Humans (2019) Animals vs Humans is a series of short internet videos that are published on YouTube by Disney Channel. Each episode shows the two main characters, Dylan and Dolly watching some funny live-action videos about humans and animals. A total of 15 shorts were released worldwide so far, but only 4 were released in the UK. Release Broadcast The series was originally going to be released sometime in 2018, but was delayed for unknown reasons. However, it did had a sneak peek on Disney Channel in the UK and Ireland on December 14 that year with the episode \\"Dog's Best Friend\\" and the short \\"Merry Pups\\". Disney Channel in Germany also premiered a sneak peek of the series on December 15 with the first two episodes, and other Disney Channels across Europe followed suit. The rest of the series launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland on March 18, 2019 with other countries following after, like Africa on April 1, 2019, Australia and New Zealand on June 1, 2019, being on Disney Junior, and Southeast Asia on October 5, 2019. The first season concluded airing in the UK and Ireland on February 22, 2020. Streaming Though the series was originally going to be released on Disney Channels worldwide, on June 11, 2019, the Annecy Film Festival reported that the series would have an American streaming release on Disney+. On January 23, 2020, Jack Binstead announced the official US launch date for the series; he also stated that the series would also have a streaming release in Canada.https://www.instagram.com/p/B7rT46tJ2U9/ The entire first season was released in both countries on February 28, 2020, following the UK airdate of the first season finale. The episodes released have been combined into two segments (though the series is not produced by combining episodes together). Although originally it was to be added on May 1, 2020 in Australia, it was delayed and released on May 8. It was added to Disney+ in the UK and Ireland on October 1, 2020, due to the closure of all British Disney channels.

A project has a direct-profit redistribution effect and a direct-cost redistribution effect. But whether it is profit or cost, the redistribution effect can be expressed as a benefit to a group of people or department or region, and the loss to another party. In theory, the indirect profit and indirect costs can also be derived from the redistribution effect, and valued. Inflation related Inflation affects an individual's economic life in various ways, and impacts the economic life of the entire society as well. One of the effects of inflation on the economy is the income \\"distribution effect\\" of inflation. *Inflation negatively impacts people with fixed incomes. For those on a fixed income—whose income lags behind a rise in prices, causing the actual purchasing power of their income to decline due to inflation—their living standards will inevitably decrease. *In reality, people who rely on government relief to maintain their lives are more vulnerable to inflation, because the adjustment of payment transfer by governments is relatively slow. Furthermore, the salaried class and civil servants are more vulnerable to such shocks. Those who earn incomes that change with inflation will benefit from inflation. For example, workers in an expanding industry, who have strong union support, have wage contracts with provisions for wages to increase with a rise in living expenses or the possibility of substantial wage increases in new contracts. *Inflation is not good for savers. As prices rise, the purchasing power of deposits will fall, and those who hold idle currency deposited in the bank will be severely hit. Similarly, insurance premiums, pensions, and other fixed-value securities assets were originally intended to use as precautionary saving or pension, and their actual value will fall with inflation. *Inflation creates a redistribution of income between debtor and creditor. Specifically, inflation sacrifices the interests of creditors to benefit the debtor. For example, A borrows 10,000 dollars from B and agrees to return it after one year. Assuming inflation occurs in the year and the price doubles, the amount A returned to B can only purchase half of the original purchase of products and services, which is to say, inflation causes B to lose half of their actual income. In order to reflect the impact of inflation on the borrower's actual income, the real interest rate is generally used instead of the nominal interest rate. The actual interest rate is equal to the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Assuming the bank deposit rate is 5% and the inflation rate is 10%, At this point, the actual rate of return on deposits is -5% - (5% - 10% = -5%) Practical research shows that since World War II, Western governments have obtained a large amount of redistributed wealth from inflation. There are two sources: First, the government has received inflated tax revenue. Because some taxes in government taxation are progressive, such as personal income tax, during an inflationary period, individuals' nominal income could increase. They need to pay income tax as their income reaches higher brackets; hence the government receives more taxes. Therefore, some Western economists believe that it is difficult to hope that the government will try to stop inflation. Second, in the modern economy, the government has issued government bonds as a means of raising funds and a means by which the government regulates the economy, so that the government has a larger amount of national debt, and inflation allows the government to benefit as a debtor. Monetary policy related Taking expansionary monetary policy as an example, there are several channels through which monetary policy affects income distribution. The first is the asset portfolio. As far as expansionary monetary policy is concerned, cash, deposits, and other assets have no, or relatively stable, gain; and their purchasing power is more likely to be affected. Housing, gold, and other physical assets have strong anti- inflation functions, or the rate of return is tied more closely to monetary expansion. People with different assets will be affected differently. Generally, the proportion of low-income individuals holding cash is relatively high, and the proportion of high-income people holding physical assets is relatively high. Therefore, the expansionary monetary policy will increase the income gap due to the different asset portfolios. The asset-portfolio channel involves the redistribution of stock wealth. For example, under the expansionary monetary policy, asset prices, especially housing prices, tend to increase even more; and industrial product prices increase less. Because high- income people hold more assets, thus the income gap will increase. In the case of hyperinflation, this channel will have a major impact on income distribution, and the savings or pensions accumulated by low-income people over many years will shrink sharply. Income channel For wage-income or fixed-income earners, expansionary monetary policy will reduce the purchasing power of their income; the quality of life will decline. The income level of floating-income earners will change with inflation, or those who depend on the nominal return on assets, will be less affected. Especially for profit takers, inflation leads to a decline in real wages but profits will rise and profit takers benefit. Financial participation channel Inflation reduces the debt burden and skews income distribution from creditors to debtors. Inflation will benefit people who have the opportunity and the ability to increase their debt. Similarly, as expansionary monetary policy is first transmitted to financial markets, and the price of financial products rises, the income level of people participating in financial markets will increase faster. Capital accumulation channel Monetary expansion will accelerate the accumulation of capital in the whole society. The proportion of capital elements relative to labor factors will increase, which will increase the income gap of the whole society. Financial aid channel Unconventional quantitative-easing monetary policy will reduce interest rates when purchasing certain financial assets, and companies can benefit. The central bank's targeted support is more obvious when it comes to bailing out individual financial institutions. In general, the expansion of the central bank's asset side directly benefits some institutions or groups of people, and the expansion of the debtor, or the loss of the assets side, is borne by the entire public. This has a clear income- distribution effects. During the 2008-crisis rescue process, the US Congress repeatedly asked the Fed about the issue of interest distribution. Expansionary monetary policy is more beneficial to those who have more physical assets, more participation in the financial market, more flexible income levels and more liabilities. These people are usually those with higher income. It is even more disadvantageous for those who have more cash deposits, less financial market participation, fixed income, and less debt. These people are usually low-income earners, which will increase the income gap. At the same time, the expansion of monetary policy is also likely to reduce the income gap. First, low interest rates (expansionary monetary policy) can damage savers (reducing their interest income) and favor borrowers. Since savers are usually richer, that may reduce the income gap. Savings here refers to broad-based assets, and interest refers to the income of various assets. One of the main goals of the expansionary monetary policy is to reduce the unemployment rate, which is the majority of the income of low-income people, thus helping to reduce the income gap of the whole society. For each market entity, the impact of monetary policy is not evenly distributed. Different policy instruments will have different effects, which may aggravate or narrow the income gap. Some studies have found that expansionary monetary policy will increase the income gap, but other studies have shown that expansionary monetary policy can narrow the gap. In the long run, income distribution is mainly determined by a number of other, \\"actual\\" variables, such as technological innovation making the production process more dependent on labor or capital, changes in long-term return of capital, national education level, participation in globalization, etc. The impact of monetary factors on these non-monetary variables is small in the long run, meaning the income distribution effect is not obvious. Over a long period of time, monetary policy will undergo multiple rounds of expansion and contraction, offsetting its impact on income distribution, and its effect becomes more difficult to measure. When studying income distribution, it is important to determine the time horizon. For example, at the end of an economic bubble, asset prices fall, debt is written down, highly leveraged companies suffer; and this affects high-income people. As wealth shrinks, the income gap of the whole society will shrink significantly; and this is when monetary policy shifts to an easing period, which will also narrow the gap. Looking at this correlation, it will be seen that expansionary monetary policy reduces the income gap; but there is no causal relationship between the two. Thereafter, the impact of the financial crisis on the real economy will increase, the impact on low-income people will increase, and the societal income gap will increase. This has little to do with the expansionary monetary policy. The real impact of the policy is that with asset prices and the price index rising, the effect of an expanding the income gap will appear. However, if we look at the whole process, it will be found that the effect of expansionary monetary policy on income distribution is not significant. In addition, monetary factors affect income distribution and economic growth. Income distribution is a nominal variable and economic growth is an actual variable. The concept of currency neutrality may apply in economic-growth research; while studying income distribution, currency factors are important and cannot be ignored. The income gap affects the achievement of the ultimate goal of the monetary policy. Economics schools such as Marx, Malthus, and Cairns all believe that the law of diminishing marginal propensity to consume lowers the consumption rate of high-income people, and the corresponding savings rate becomes higher. If the income gap is too large and wealth is too concentrated, it will affect the demand of the whole society, which, if seriously insufficient, induces an economic recession. At the same time, insufficient domestic consumption and excessive savings will also be reflected in an imbalance of the balance of payments, which will affect the monetary policy's ability to achieve its ultimate goal. If the income gap is too large, it will also reduce the liquidity of a country's social class and the resilience of economic growth in the medium- and long-term, which will have a negative impact on economic growth. These issues will affect the monetary policy's ability to achieve its ultimate goal, which should be a part of the central bank's vision.

The race of the molecules takes place on a 100 nanometer track and was held for the first time in Toulouse on 28 and 29 April 2017.  History  The idea for the race was formulated in January 2013 in the ACS Nano magazine by the Toulouse organizers of CEMES-CNRS, this way a call for applications was launched to give the participating teams time to prepare appropriate nanocars. The race is officially announced by the National Centre for Scientific Research in November 2015 in Toulouse during Futurapolis1. On this occasion, five teams presented their prototype projects on November 27, 2015. The first race in the world of this type, between four vehicles, started on the 28 April 2017 at the CEMES-CNRS in Toulouse and lasted 36 hours. The Toulouse organizers also agreed on the competition of two more vehicles, which will then be remotely controlled via Internet from the CEMES-CNRS race room on the microscope of their own laboratory. These relates to the vehicles from Ohio and Graz-Rice. The Nanocar race II, the second edition of this competition will take place in 2021 and is currently in the preparation stages with the support of the European project H2020: MEMO (2017-2021).  Competition   The track  The track of the first competition is a gold surface, equipped with grooves to define race lanes in order to avoid losing vehicles. It is about 100 nanometres long, and includes two bends. It is located in a small enclosure cooled to -269°C under a primary vacuum of 10−10 mbar and is observed simultaneously by four scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) miniaturized for this event and operating on the same surface. Each microscope is responsible for driving a single vehicle (a single nanocar). During this competition, the nanocars should move as far as possible on the gold track during the 36 hours race. Speeds of 5 nanometers per hour were expected  Nanocars  Nanocars are a new class of molecular machines that can roll across solid surfaces with structurally defined direction.J. AM. CHEM. SOC. 9, 128,14, 2006, 4857 They are molecules essentially composed of a few tens or hundreds of hydrogen and carbon atoms and are measuring one to three nanometers. The nanocar is propelled step by step by electrical impulses and electron transfer from the tip of the STM. The resulting tunnel current flows through the nanocar between the tip of the microscope and the common metal track. There is no direct mechanical contact with the tip. The nanocar is therefore neither pushed nor deformed by the tip of the microscope during the race. Some of the electrons that pass through the nanocar release energy as small intramolecular vibrations that activate the nanocar's motor.

On the silver track, the vehicle of the Austrian-American team from the Universities of Rice and Graz set the first speed record with a peak speed of 95 nanometers per hour, and was ranked equally with the Swiss team. This vehicle was remotely controlled from the Toulouse race hall on the University of Graz microscope. Specific properties of the chemical structure as well as a completely new manipulation technique (without time-consuming imaging steps) rendered this nanocar very fast. These properties even allowed to complete a distance of more than 1000 nm after completion of the official race track. The American team from Ohio University turned back for no apparent reason after 20 nanometers, the German team broke 2 vehicles without being able to restart, and the Japanese team ended up giving up. The French team lost sight of its vehicle on its surface area, and was also obliged to abandon, comforting itself with the symbolic prize of \\"the most elegant car in the competition \\".  Scientific interest  To make this kind of race possible, a considerable number of problems had to be solved beforehand, such as the choice of the track and its preparation, the improvement of monitoring and control devices, in particular the sensitivity of current measurements, the evaporation of a large number of very different molecules on the same surface and microscope validation Among the benefits, the CNRS cites the development molecular motors and Tech-Atoms, that will make possible in the future the preparation of quantum electronic circuits on the surface of an isolator, atom by atom, whose calculating parts will measure less than 1 nm.

The approximately park borders the Bungonia State Conservation Area to the South, Morton National Park to the East, and Bungonia Creek to the North. Only a relatively recent addition to the national parks registry, Bungonia was originally protected as a water reserve to prevent contamination of the Shoalhaven River in the mid-late 19th century. The park is managed by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) which maintains several campgrounds and walking trails throughout the park. The park is most famous for its many caves and gorges, which offer a variety of climbing and canyoning opportunities. Bungonia National Park is also notable for its position in a chain of national parks that extend down the central NSW section of the Great Dividing Range, including Morton National Park, Budawang National Park, and Bimberamala National Park.  History  Bungonia National Park sits across the traditional lands of the indigenous Njunawal tribal group, the northwest corner of the Wandandian tribal region, and the southern boundary of the Gandangara tribal group. The prominent ridge tops are considered historically significant travel routes for tribes who moved with the seasonal harvest. Archaeological evidence of campsites has been found on the main plateau, along with limestone dolines that contain the remnants of edible plants consumed by Aboriginal peoples. The first white visitors passed through the area in 1798, led by H. Hacking, the quartermaster of the ship Sirius. The establishment of European settlement in this region began around the 1820s, with Goulburn settled in the 1840s and the town of Bungonia set to be created in 1832. Governor of NSW George Gipps visited the park in 1838, walking to the lookout now known as Bungonia Lookdown. The area now known as Bungonia National Park was initially established as a water reserve in 1872, to protect the water supply extracted from the Shoalhaven River. Also in 1872, a visit was reported to the Drum Cave and the Sky-Light Cave, named after the sound made when a stalactite was struck and the large hole in the roof, respectively. Multiple minor explorations of the park were made by Europeans throughout the late 1800s, to explore the many cave systems which were prominent features of the area. Visitor records for the park began in 1892 when 85 visitors were recorded. By 1899, this number had increased to 559, with exploration of the caves costing 15 pounds per party \\"candlesticks provided\\". A larger portion of this region was later reserved in 1902 for the preservation of fragile limestone rock formations in the park, primarily caves. The original caretaker of the park, Louis Guymer who worked between 18891909, discovered and recorded the extensive caves throughout the park. Guymer built many of the gates and ladders which continue to allow access to cave networks and climbing routes. In the 1970s, the area was involved in a series of disputes between the NSW state government, conservation groups, and several mining companies. Mining lease applications for large amounts of limestone quarrying in Bungonia Gorge were made by Southern Portland Cement and the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers, from 1972 until 1974. Pressure on the state government from the Bungonia Committee through a series of geological and environmental reports eventually led to the declaration of the Bungonia State Conservation Area in July 1974. The northernmost portion of this reserve was eventually raised to national park status.  Geology  Extensive gorges are a major feature of the park and attract many visitors Bungonia National Park is notable for its unique geology which has given it a status as the \\"adventure capital of the Southern Tablelands\\". The park contains over 200 caves and numerous gorges and canyons. The formations in Bungonia are part of the Lachlan Fold Belt which is made up of metamorphosed ordovician and devonian sandstones, shales and volcanic rocks. The rock sequence in Bungonia is highly mineralised and part of a larger series of formations which contain gold deposits of economic importance to the region. The geology of Bungonia is mostly defined by fine-grained palaeozoic sedimentary with some minor regions of acid volcanoes and limestone. A wide dry plateau makes up a great deal of the land area in the park with many cliffs and gorges occurring near prominent water-ways such as the Shoalhaven River and Bungonia Creek. The caves and fissures of the park are common of the geologic action of karstification, seen in limestone features. Limestone and sandstone are the two most prominent surface rock types in the park and make up most of the open formations. Part of the Bungonia Gorge and Bungonia slot canyon run through this park and such formations are characteristic of this type of sedimentary and volcanic activity which formed the original geology of the park. Soil in Bungonia is mostly shallow structured organic loams which lie atop of the limestone and basalt plates which form the main plateau.  Flora and fauna   Flora  Black She-oak is a prominent part of the vegetation in the park The vegetation of Bungonia National Park is extensive and with most species occurring throughout the Southern Tablelands region. Bungonia is known to contain broad-leaved peppermint (Eucalyptus dives), white gum (Eucalyptus wandoo), grass trees (xanthorrhoea), red stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha), and large amounts of black ash (Eucalyptus sieberi) forest. Eucalyptus dominate the landscape, especially on the main plateau. In colder sections of the park, snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora), and snow grass (Poa sieberiana), thrive, particularly in winter. Like much of the southern portion of the Great Dividing Range, black she-oak (allocasuarina littoralis) is common to lower canopy and regeneration areas. There is also some restricted growth of the argyle apple (Eucalyptus cinerea), known for its soft blue foliage.  Fauna  A small population of spotted-tail quolls inhabit the park Fauna common in the park are found throughout the South Eastern Highlands with eighty-eight species inhabiting the area. Sixty-three of these species are vulnerable whilst twenty-five are endangered. Dozens of bird species are found in the park and many of the lookouts are bird-watching locations. Birds that frequent Bungonia National Park include the gang-gang cockatoo, butcher bird, noisy miner, glossy black cockatoo, the swift parrot, common cockatoo, hooded robin, square tailed kite, and the kookaburra. A general decline in the population of smaller woodland bird species has been recorded in the late 20th century along with an increase in the butcher-bird, noisy miner, and common-myna population. Other fauna in the park include the vulnerable large bent-wing bat which breeds in many of the caves in the cooler parts of the year. Monitor lizards, echidnas, wombats, wallabies, and small populations of koalas and spotted-tail quolls also inhabit the park.  Climate and environmental issues  Hooded robins are a threatened species in the park due to habitat destruction The average summer temperature in Bungonia National Park is between 12 degrees Celsius and 26 degrees Celsius with the highest recorded temperature being 40 degrees Celsius. Due to its increased altitude and inland southerly position, the park receives very cool winter temperatures. On average the temperature sits between 1 degree Celsius and 14 degrees Celsius with the lowest ever recorded temperature being -9 degrees Celsius. Average rainfall in the region is around 665mm with most precipitation occurring in March and the least in September. The highest recorded rainfall in a single day is 200.7mm. Environmental issues in the park are most prominent in the koala and spotted-tail quoll population, both of which are endangered by habitat destruction and feral animals. NSW Parks have been conducting feral animal control programs since 2005. Small woodland bird species such as the hooded robin and varied sittella have also come under threat due to habitat destruction caused by mining projects in the region. Larger native and non-native birds that are more wide-ranging have begun to take over these areas and are gradually driving out these less-hardy species. The threatened large bent-wing bat breeds caves in the park as mating and hibernating locations. This has led to NPWS regularly closing off the Drum and Grill caves in order to protect the population during their vulnerable breeding season. The Boral limestone quarry at the northern end of Bungonia Gorge. Large boulders can be seen rolling down the sides of the hill into the gorge below A large limestone quarry operated by Boral Limited immediately to the north of the Bungonia Gorge has also raised concerns regarding the preservation of significant geology in the area. The quarrying run-off poses a risk to water sources in the area whilst land clearing and subsequent erosion has threatened certain parts of the gorge structure and the eucalypt forest which covers the hills surrounding the valley. Site remediation was due to follow the closure of the quarry in 2011, however in 2015 Boral Limited requested a 30-year extension on their lease. Their current activities involve filling in the southern end of the pit and re-vegetating their emplacements with native species whilst they continue to quarry the northern section.  Park highlights  Caving is a popular activity in the park with hundreds of caves open to explore throughout the year. Access to many of these caves is via ladders or by anchored ropes which allows their use by experienced and inexperienced cavers alike. Several of the larger caves include the Drum Cave and Grill Cave. Other caves include the Blowfly Cave, Argyle Cave, Chalk Cave, College Cave, Canberra Hole, Fossil Cave, Spider and dozens of other unnamed caves. Dangerous levels of CO2 are often present in these systems, especially in summer. Marked hiking trails are maintained throughout the park with five main tracks. These five tracks are called the Yellow Track, Green Track, Red Track, White Track, and Orange Track. An access road links many of these tracks to the main office and visitor centre. Adams Lookout, Jerrara Lookout and Bungonia Lookdown are all well positioned locations for viewing the gorges and valleys that surround the plateau. There are three picnic areas in the park and one camping area, all of which are managed by NPWS and are open for public access. Bungonia Slot Canyon provides many opportunities for bouldering and harnessed line climbing and offers some of the only limestone climbing available in Australia.  Incidents  Numerous accidents have occurred in Bungonia National Park, partly due to its popularity with cavers and climbers, as well as its lack of marked tracks and dense bushland. Several fatalities and injuries have been recorded since 1991. The death by falling of an outdoor education student in 1991 was investigated by homicide detectives who suspected that the victim had been threatened and later pushed by one of the other students. No charges were ever laid however as the coroner could not identify what caused the fall. In 2001, emergency services were called on to rescue a man who had become trapped between rocks in Bungonia National Park. A 2005 incident involved the injury of a woman from Gladesville who became lost after an orienteering activity in the park. She was later treated for hypothermia. In 2014, three men who were caving in Bungonia became trapped after a flash flood occurred and access was cut off. The men were trapped for nearly 24 hours before being rescued by NSW Search and Rescue workers.

This is mostly achieved through operation at lower temporal and spatial resolution than more comprehensive general circulation models (GCMs). Due to the nonlinear relationship between spatial resolution and model run-speed, modest reductions in resolution can lead to large improvements in model run-speed. This has historically allowed the inclusion of previously unincorporated earth-systems such as ice sheets and carbon cycle feedbacks. These benefits are conventionally understood to come at the cost of some model accuracy. However, the degree to which higher resolution models improve accuracy rather than simply precision is contested.Jakob, C. (2014). Going back to basics. Nature Climate Change, 4:1042–1045.Lovejoy, S.

(2008). The origins of computer weather prediction and climate modeling. Journal of Computational Physics, 227(7):3431–3444. By 1955 these advances had produced what is recognisable now as a primitive GCM (Phillips prototype Phillips, N. A. (1956). The general circulation of the atmosphere: A numerical experiment. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 82(352):123–164). Even at this early stage, a lack of computing power formed a significant barrier to entry and limitation on model-time.

Dynamically consistent, quasi-hydrostatic equations for global models with a complete representation of the coriolis force. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 121(522):399– 418.. GCMs also began to incorporate more earth systems and feedback mechanisms, transforming themselves into coupled Earth Systems Models. The inclusion of elements from the cryosphere, carbon cycle and cloud feedbacks was both facilitated and constrained by growth in computing power . The powerful computers and high cost required to run these “comprehensive” models limited accessibility to many university research groups. This helped drive the development of EMICs. Through judicious parametrisation of key variables, researchers could run climate simulations on less powerful computers, or alternatively much faster on comparable computers. A modern example of this difference in speed can be seen between the EMIC JUMP-LCM and the GCM MIROC4h; the former runs 63,000 times faster than the latter Hajima, T., Kawamiya, M., Watanabe, M., Kato, E., Tachiiri, K., Sugiyama, M., Watanabe, S., Okajima, H., and Ito, A.

It was shortly afterwards at the IGBP congress in Shonnan Village, Japan, in May 1999, where the acronym “EMICs” was publicly coined by Claussen. The first simplified model to adopt the nomenclature of “intermediate complexity” is now one of the best known: CLIMBER 2. The Potsdam conference under the guidance of Claussen identified 10 EMICs, a list updated to 13 in 2005 . Eight models contributed to IPCC AR4, and 15 to AR5 Randall, D. A., Wood, R.

(2002). Earth system models of intermediate complexity: closing the gap in the spectrum of climate system models. Climate Dynamics, 18(7):579–586.. Integration expresses the level of interaction of different components of the earth system. This is influenced by the number of different links in the web (interactivity of coordinates), as well as the frequency of interaction. Because of their speed, EMICs offer the opportunity for highly integrated simulations when compared with more comprehensive ESMs. Four EMIC categorisations have been suggested based on the mode of atmospheric simplification : Statistical-Dynamical Models, Energy Moisture Balance Models, Quasi Geostrophic Models, and Primitive Equation Models. Of the 15 models in the community contribution to the IPCC’s fifth assessment report, four were statistical-dynamic, seven energy moisture balance, two quasi-geostrophic and two primitive equations models Eby, M., Weaver, A.

Rather than continuous evolution of solutions to the Navier Stokes or Primitive Equations, atmospheric dynamics are handled through statistical knowledge of the system (an approach not new to CLIMBER Saltzman, B. (1978). A survey of statistical-dynamical models of the terrestrial climate. volume 20 of Advances in Geophysics, pages 183 – 304. Elsevier.). This approach expresses the dynamics of the atmosphere as large- scale, long term fields of velocity and temperature. Climber-3α’s horizontal atmospheric resolution is substantially coarser than a typical atmospheric GCM at 7.5°x 22.5°. With a characteristic spatial scale of 1000km, this simplification prohibits resolution of synoptic level features. Climber-3α incorporates comprehensive ocean, sea ice and biogeochemistry models. Despite these full descriptions, simplification of the atmosphere allows it to operate two orders of magnitude faster than comparable GCMs . Both CLIMBER models offer performances comparable to that of contemporary GCMs in simulating present climates. This is clearly of interest due to the significantly lower computational costs. Both models have been principally used to investigate paleoclimates, particularly ice sheet nucleation.Ganopolski, A., Rahmstorf, S., Petoukhov, V., and Claussen, M. (1998).

An atmospheric energy-moisture balance model: Climatology, interpen- tadal climate change, and coupling to an ocean general circulation model. Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 101(D10):15111–15128.. By parametrising heat and moisture transport with diffusion, timescales are limited to greater than annual and length scales to greater than 1000km. A key result of the thermodynamic rather than fluid dynamic approach is that the simulated climate exhibits no internal variability. Like CLIMBER-3α, it is coupled to a state of the art, 3D ocean model and includes other cutting edge models for sea-ice and land-ice. Unlike CLIMBER, the UVic model does not have significantly coarser resolution than contemporary AOGCMs (3.6°x 1.8°). As such, all computational advantage is from the simplification of atmospheric dynamics.

Biogeophysical effects of historical land cover changes simulated by six earth system models of intermediate complexity. Climate Dynamics, 26(6):587–600.. The model exhibits some significant limitations that are fundamentally linked to its design. The model predicts an Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity of 1.9°C, at the lower end of the range of GCM predictions. The model’s surface temperature distribution is overly-symmetric, and does not represent the northern bias in location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The model generally shows lower skill at low latitudes. Other examples of quasi-geostrophic models are PUMA and SPEEDY. Primitive Equations Model - FAMOUS The UK Met-Office’s FAMOUS blurs the line between more coarsely resolved comprehensive models and EMICs. Designed to run paleoclimate simulations of the Pleistocene, it has been tuned to reproduce the climate of its parent, HADCM3, by solving the Primitive Equations written down by Charney. These are of higher complexity than the quasi-geostrophic equations. Originally named ADTAN, preliminary runs had significant biases involving sea ice and the AMOC, which were later corrected through tuning of sea-ice parameters. The model runs at half the horizontal resolution of HADCM3. Atmospheric resolution is 7.5°x5°, and oceanic is 3.75°x 2.5°. Atmosphere-Ocean coupling is done once daily. Comparing and Assessing EMIC Skill Systematic intercomparison of EMICs has been undertaken since 2000, most recently with a community contribution to the IPCC’s fifth assessment report . The equilibrium and transient climate sensitivity of EMICs broadly fell within the range of contemporary GCMs with a range of 1.9 - 4.0°C (compared to 2.1° - 4.7°C, CMIP5). Tested over the last millennium, the average response of the models was close to the real trend, however this conceals much wider variation between individual models. Models generally overestimate ocean heat uptake over the last millennium and indicate a moderate slowing. No relationship was observed in EMICs between levels of polar amplification, climate sensitivity, and initial state . The above comparisons to the performance of GCMs and comprehensive ESMs do not reveal the full value of EMICs. Their ability to run as “fast ESMs” allows them to simulate much longer periods, up to many millennia. As well as running on time-scales far greater than available to GCMs, they provide fertile ground for development and integration of systems that will later join GCMs. The Future of EMICs and the Complexity Spectrum Possible future directions for EMICs are likely to be in assessment of uncertainties and as a vanguard for incorporation of new earth systems Weber, S. L. (2010). The utility of earth system models of intermediate complexity (emics). Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, 1(2):243–252.. By virtue of speed they also lend themselves to the creation of ensembles with which to constrain parameters and assess earth systems Brovkin, V., Claussen, M., Driesschaert, E., Fichefet, T., Kicklighter, D., Loutre, M. F., Matthews, H. D., Ramankutty, N., Schaeffer, M., and Sokolov, A. (2006). Biogeophysical effects of historical land cover changes simulated by six earth system models of intermediate complexity. Climate Dynamics, 26(6):587–600.. EMICs have also recently led in the field of climate stabilisation research . McGuffie and Henderson-Sellers argued in 2001 that in the future, EMICs would be “as important” as GCMs to the climate modelling field \\\\- while this has perhaps not been true in the time since that statement, their role has not diminished. Finally, as climate science has come under increasing levels of scrutiny McCright, A. M., Dunlap, R. E., & Marquart-Pyatt, S. T. (2016). Political ideology and views about climate change in the European Union. Environmental Politics, 25(2), 338-358.Dunlap, R. E., McCright, A. M., & Yarosh, J. H. (2016). The political divide on climate change: Partisan polarization widens in the US. Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, 58(5), 4-23., the ability of models not just to project but to explain has become important. The transparency of EMICs is attractive in this domain, as causal chains are easier to identify and communicate (as opposed to emergent properties generated by comprehensive models).

It was designed by C. R. Summerhayes and built from 1898 to 1931 by J. Noble. It is also known as Ayia Trias and Agia Triada. The property is owned by Greek Orthodox Community of NSW. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 May 2010.  History  Orthodoxy arrived in Australia in the late nineteenth century when significant numbers of Greek, Lebanese and Russian immigrants made their way here from their homelands. The early migrants were attracted to Australia for a number of reasons, but particularly by the prospect of a new land and the chance to better their lives by amassing their fortunes in a developing settlement. Although the Lebanese migrants, known originally as Syrians, made a more permanent move by bringing their families and culture with them, the Greek migrants saw their Australian experience as a temporary measure to build their financial security before returning home to the Motherland and their families in Greece. As such, these migrants were largely young single men with no intention of settling in Australia or at least not until they were financially well established and could bring their wives and families from Greece to join them. For the majority, however, Australia was a place where they could make a fortune and then return to Greece to enjoy the hard-earned fruits of their labour. When some did return home to Greece, news of Australia spread and chain migration began with family and friends of migrants going abroad to join them. As migration continued, a community developed in Australia with the implementation of the necessary organisations and structures needed to support the new immigrants who were still, overwhelmingly, single men with little to no understanding of the language and with few marketable employment skills. This institutional structure was important to the new migrants in helping them get established in a new country and integrate into their own community and the broader Australian society while maintaining their traditions, values and cultural identity. The migration experience was a binding force within these communities and these newly established institutions were able to provide food, shelter, supplies and a stable family-type environment for the migrants that followed. These strong connections promoted ethnic unity and enabled the newly settled communities to sustain the cultural and religious practices brought with them from their homeland, as well as being an inclusive unit that could withstand the cultural and social isolation of the new country. Through the assistance of these communities, the new migrants tended to settle in clusters and, with the Greek and Lebanese communities, these areas were Surry Hills, Waterloo and Redfern (which was to become the hub of Orthodox immigration by the late nineteenth century). Religious institutions were also particularly important in the experiences and settlement of the new immigrants in Australia. In the very early days of the migration of Orthodox Greeks, Lebanese and Russians, there were no dedicated churches in which the migrants could worship but the celebration of major religious holidays (particularly Christmas and Easter) did continue through makeshift services being conducted by travelling priests. For the continuation of the Orthodox faith, however, this pattern of worship was far from ideal. In 1897, led by Athanassios Cominos, an interim committee was established with the intention of founding the Greek Community of NSW in Sydney as well as working towards the construction of a dedicated Greek Orthodox church to service the needs of the growing community. Particularly amongst the Greek community, a legitimate church was essential in ensuring that their religious celebrations were recognised both in the new community and also back in Greece. There was a significant fear in the community that marriages would not be valid in the Motherland if they were not conducted in a recognised religious institution by an appointed Orthodox priest. To counter these growing concerns, the community decided to attract a Greek priest to Australia, largely through the construction of the first dedicated Greek Orthodox church in Australia. In the meantime however, the Orthodox Greeks turned to the Anglican Church who opened the doors of the St James Parish Hall in Sydney to be available for regular Orthodox worship, pending the construction of a Greek Orthodox Church. These services were conducted by Archimandrite Dorotheos Bakaliaros who, from 1895, was the first Greek Orthodox priest in Australia to administer religious services to the communities of Sydney and Melbourne. During this period, Archimandrite Dorotheos also encouraged the construction of a dedicated church for the parishioners and, in late 1897, fund-raising efforts had begun. Within six months, the land had been donated by Ioannis Cominos (the brother of Athanassios), and donations of A£390 had been collected from the Orthodox community to go towards the building project. The first step in the construction of the Holy Trinity (Ayia Trias) Church, this being the first Greek Orthodox place of worship in Australia, was the laying of the foundation stones in an official ceremony on 29 May 1898. This date is significant in the history of Orthodoxy, being the date the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 and it has since become the date on which all Holy Trinity churches are founded. Through this tradition, 29 May has also become the date that represents the courageous extension of Hellenism and Orthodoxy around the world. The ceremony to lay the three foundation stones in 1898 was presided over by Archimandrite Dorotheous, who conducted the service in Greek, and was attended by the Consuls-General of Greece and France, the Consuls of Russia, Argentina and Sweden and a large congregation of Orthodox Greeks and Lebanese. The three stones were laid (two in opposite corners, and one in the centre where the altar would be placed) and within each stone was placed a small iron cross, a bottle of holy water and a collection of English and Greek silver coins. The fund-raising efforts continued at the ceremony with a further A£190 collected. Along with the money already raised, the construction of the Holy Trinity Church was underway and, by 1899, it was completed and furnished for a total of A£848 and eight shillings. For another A£454 11s, the community also built a residence for the priest adjacent to the church. The Holy Trinity Church was constructed with the intention that it would be a place of worship for the Orthodox faith, whether its congregation was Greek, Lebanese or Russian. All doctrinal groups were acknowledged by the Ecumenical Council of Constantinople and so were regarded as sister churches within the Orthodox faith. Financial contributions towards the construction of the Holy Trinity Church were also made by Lebanese migrants, some of whom also served within official positions in the Orthodox community. With a newly built church serving such a diverse congregation, the Holy Trinity Church was in need of a bilingual priest and, after approaching the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, Father Serafeim Phocas was appointed as the first accredited resident Orthodox priest for the Holy Trinity Church. Arriving in Sydney in March 1899, Fr Serafeim, along with Fr Athanassios Kantopoulos from Melbourne, led the Easter and official consecration ceremonies at the Holy Trinity Church on 16 April 1899. For a community of only approximately 500 faithful, the erection and consecration of a designated church and priest residence was a great achievement for Sydney's developing Orthodox community. During Fr Serafeim's term as the resident priest at the Holy Trinity Church, he officiated in hundreds of religious ceremonies. However, he was obliged to step down from his position in 1913 due to bad health.Fr Serafeim died 15 August 1917. During his term, however, relations between the Orthodox Greeks, Lebanese and Russians had remained cordial but with a revised constitution adopted in 1914 and the transfer of spiritual allegiance from the Patriarchate of Jerusalem to the Church of Greece, membership at the Holy Trinity Church became limited to those of Greek descent only. This caused tension within the diverse congregation and, as such, the Lebanese and Russian Orthodox members received strong encouragement to seek an alternative location for worship. Although regular services continued to be held at the Holy Trinity Church for some time, when the St George Antiochian Orthodox Cathedral in Redfern was opened by the Orthodox Lebanese members in 1920, official relations between the groups came to an end. The Orthodox Russians also followed suit, moving from the Holy Trinity Church at a similar time to hold their services at the St George Cathedral. With the retirement of Fr Serafeim, the leaders of the Greek Orthodox Community approached the Church of Greece for another priest to serve the congregation and, in late 1913, Fr Dimitrios Marinakis arrived in Sydney. Fr Marinakis served as the resident priest at the Holy Trinity Church for some 10 years but, during this time, the church and its community experienced the beginning of the friction that would play a significant role in its history. During his term, Fr Marinakis was accused of being preoccupied with money and his business activities, to the detriment of his duties to the church and the school that taught the traditional culture and the modern Greek language to the children of the congregation. Fr Marinakis withstood much of this criticism but, after losing the support of the Greek Orthodox Community, was dismissed in 1923 and replaced by Fr Athinagoras Varaklas. Fr Varaklas was to become the central figure in the division within the Community and the church's congregation that was to shape the Orthodox history in Australia over the next 10 years. From the early years of the twentieth century, the Orthodox Greeks in Australia had been under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Church of Greece, an autocephalous branch of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. In an effort to reclaim its authority over the Australian Orthodox branches, the Ecumenical Patriarchate established the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Australia and New Zealand in 1924 and appointed Dr Christoforos Knitis as the Metropolitan. This action caused an intense dispute between the Greek Community of Sydney and the new religious authority, the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Australia and New Zealand, thus dividing the community into those in support and those opposing the Metropolitan. Over the next few years, Metropolita Knitis and the Holy Trinity Church experienced many turbulent times and conflict between these opposing factions. So much so, the Metropolita Knitis and his supporters established a separate church, Saint Sophia Cathedral (Ayia Sofia) in Paddington in 1927. This definitive split in the Orthodox Community was also a result of Fr Varaklas not recognising or accepting Knitis or the authority of the newly formed Metropolis and his refusal to step down from his duties at the Holy Trinity Church. Varaklas and his supporters, the anti-MetropArchbishop faction, maintained that he was the parish priest at the Holy Trinity Church and that he would continue to lead its religious services. With the break between the factions and the move of the Metropolita and his supporters to the St Sophia Cathedral, Fr Varaklas was able to resume his priestly responsibilities and did so until he left Australia for the US, with significant honours by the Community and his congregation, in 1932. With the departure of Metropolita Knitis in 1928 and the subsequent term of Metropolita Timotheos Evagelinides from 1932 to 1947, significant efforts were made to reconcile the opposing factions. However, there was considerable hesitation from the Holy Trinity Church in that, by reconciling with St Sophia Cathedral, the Holy Trinity Church would, along with conceding some administrative dominance, take on joint responsibility for the significant financial debt St Sophia Cathedral had acquired during its construction. At the time, St Sophia Cathedral was A£4,800 in debt and the trustees at the Holy Trinity Church were concerned that that amount would bankrupt the church. However, after a prolonged period of co-existence, the two churches were finally reconciled into the one Community, the Greek Orthodox Community of Sydney and NSW, in April 1945.Gilchrist, vol 1, 2 & 3.Dimitreas, Yiannis E., 1998.Lebanese Settlement Committee, 1983.Dept of Immigration & Ethnic Affairs, 1984.Convy, Paul & Monsour, Anne 2008.Tsingris, 1998.Kanarakis, George, 1997.Chryssavgis, Fr Miltiades & Chryssavgis, Fr John, 1985.Turnbull & Valiotis, 2001.Costadopoulos-Hill, Maria, 1979.Greek Orthodox Community of NSW websiteThe Sydney Morning Herald, 1898.Protopopov, Michael Alex, 2005.  Description  The Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church is aesthetically distinctive and prominent in its streetscape. Originally built in the Byzantine style of architecture (perhaps reflective of how highly the founding congregation regarded their Byzantine Christian heritage, the church was constructed to hold up to 400 patrons. In 1931, the facade of the church was replaced with a two-storey Inter-War Romanesque construction of face brick with rendered dressings, buttresses and a gable roof. As a result of these alterations, the entrance to the church is now framed by two brick towers and is headed by an arched leadlight window above a triple arched entranceway. The original facade is, however, still discernable upon entering the foyer of the church. The interior of the church is well decorated with representations and symbols of iconography. There are also a number of original artefacts still in use including the alter, the main chandelier (as well as a number of others), a selection of hanging lamps and two candle stands inscribed with the date of donation (1899). An extensive collection of original artefacts is currently housed at the office of the Greek Orthodox Community of NSW Ltd in a museum/archival resource centre.  Condition  The church is in very good condition with a high degree of original fabric (including the alter, a number of chandeliers, a selection of hanging lamps and two candle stands). The church is in very good condition with a high degree of intact original fabric.  Modifications and dates  The facade of the church was replaced with an Inter-War Romanesque construction in 1931. The priest's residence at the rear of the property has undergone a complete internal renovation.  Heritage listing  The Ayia Trias (Holy Trinity) Greek Orthodox Church has state significance as the first dedicated Greek Orthodox church to be built in Australia. Constructed in 1898 to serve the growing migrant Orthodox community in Sydney, the Holy Trinity Church (along with the land it sits on and the adjacent priest's residence) was funded entirely by the congregation. Since the late nineteenth century when the early members migrated and settled in Sydney, the church has been a centre of stability to its congregation and a place where people could meet and practice their traditional culture, values and language. The subsequent interaction and support network was essential to the settlement of these communities in Australia and, as a result, the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church has been a dedicated place for Christian Orthodox worship for over 100 years. Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 May 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church has State significance as the first Greek Orthodox Church established in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere. Built in 1898, this church played an important role in the settlement of immigrant communities in Sydney in the late nineteenth century. The church provided an institutional structure to support the migrants while being a communal venue through which they could maintain the traditional culture, values and language of their homeland. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church has State significance for its association with the migrant communities that settled in Australia, particularly in Sydney, in the late nineteenth century. Originally, these groups were largely made up of Christian Orthodox Greeks, Lebanese and Russians and, when they arrived, there were no religious or social institutions to support them as they settled into a new country. The migration experience was a binding force within these groups and together they established, among other things, the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church to service the needs of the growing community. Religion had an important role during this settlement period because the church was an institution through which the new migrants could practice and maintain their traditional culture, values and language. Developing a united community was also important for social interaction and support and the church became a centre of stability for these migrant groups in the Australian society. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. As many religious buildings in NSW, the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church is aesthetically distinctive in its streetscape. The facade of the church was altered in 1931 and replaced with an Inter-War Romanesque design, headed by an arched leadlight window over a triple arched doorway. However, although it has undergone some modification, the design and scale of the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church ensures the building maintains its prominent position in the streetscape and in the community. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church has State significance for the important role it has played, and continues to play, in the lives of the Orthodox community in Sydney. For the early migrants who knew very little of Australia, the church was significant in helping them to settle into the community while being a venue through which they could practice and sustain their traditional culture, values and language. Being the first Orthodox church established in Australia, the Holy Trinity Church represented a centre of stability in the lives of these new immigrants and provided a unified institution that could counter their feelings of social and cultural isolation. Today, over 100 years since the early days of its establishment, the Holy Trinity Church continues to play a role in the Greek-Australian experience as a spiritual centre for Christian Orthodox worship in NSW. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Although the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church was the first to be established in Australia, it does not appear to have potential to reveal further information that would contribute to a great understanding of the site. The church does, however, have a number of both decorative and practical artefacts that date from the period of construction. Further analysis of these items could provide insight into the origins of the church and the period in which it was built. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The presence of a number of Greek Orthodox churches in Sydney and NSW ensures that the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church is not rare in NSW today. However, being a foundational church, it is uniquely significant. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church has State significance as a representative example of an Orthodox church in NSW. Holy Trinity, in itself, is a doctrine that underlies all theology and spirituality in the Orthodox faith and its foundation, on May 29, is representative of the day the Byzantine Empire fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 (this is also the date that all Holy Trinity Churches in the world are founded). Although the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church was the first of its kind in Australia, it is representative of religious buildings in Sydney that were built to service the needs of the community. Churches have always played an integral role in the community as places where people can meet and sustain their social, cultural and religious practices. As well as this, the Holy Trinity Church is also significant for the role it has played in providing stability in the newly settled immigrant communities.

Early life and education Betsabeé Romero was born in Mexico City in 1963. She earned her Bachelor of Arts (Licenciatura en Comunicación) at the Universidad Iberoamericana (1980–1984). She earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from Academia de San Carlos in 1986. She also studied at the Louvre and the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. After studying in France, she returned to Mexico to study pre-Hispanic and colonial art, earning a second master's degree in Art History from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) in 1994. Works Materials Tribute to Wirikuta, 2011, Montreal, Canada Memoria de Hojalata, Parque España, Mexico City She intentionally chooses materials that have been used and discarded. Some of her favorite materials are worn-down automobile tires and other car parts. Through sculpture and painting, she transforms these everyday materials to create \\"refashioned cars, carved tires, painted hoods, and incised mirrors.\\" They are overlaid with images and symbols inspired by Mexican history and culture, ranging from pre-colonial to present times. Tires and cars also serve as symbols of mobility and human migration. Many of Romero's works combine aspects of sculpture and printmaking, as she pairs modern materials with traditional imagery. She carves textures, patterns, and symbols onto the surface of large discarded tires, treating the rubber as if it were wood. Sometimes she uses the sculpted wheels as giant printmaking rollers to create elaborate textile patterns or tracks in clay. The materials themselves have significance in a global context, evoking a history of colonialist exploitation as well as recycling and renewal. Natural rubber comes from the milky sap of Hevea brasiliensis, a tree that is indigenous to Brazil and cultivated throughout South America and South-east Asia. In spite of the creation of synthetic rubber, natural rubber still provides about 30 per cent of worldwide rubber production. The history of rubber is complex and difficult, with worldwide social, economic, and political impact. Romero has also used chewing gum as a material, in works such as her suspended tire sculpture, De Tuti fruti. Gum comes from chicle resin, which is extracted from the sapodilla tree of southern Mexico and Central America. Its history dates back to the Mayans and Aztecs. Exhibitions Betsabeé Romero has participated in more than 20 biennials, including those of Cuba, Brazil, Monterrey, Cairo, and Vancouver, Canada. She has held more than 40 individual exhibitions in Mexico and other countries worldwide. Some of her earliest solo exhibitions were at the Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil (El MACG) in Mexico City (1999), and Sous la grisaille de México, at Espace d'Art Yvonamor Palix in Paris, France (1999). A ten-year retrospective including 103 pieces of her work, Betsabeé Romero: Lagrimas Negras (Black Tears) was curated by Julián Zugazagoitia and shown at the Museo Amparo in Puebla, Mexico (2007–2008). Versions of this exhibition have also appeared at Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso (2010), and the Neuberger Museum of Art (2011). El Vuelo y Su Semilla (The Flight and Its Seed) examined interplaying themes of migration, colonization, food and traditional culture. It was shown by the Mexican Cultural Institute in Washington, D.C. and San Antonio, Texas\` (2017). Each of five rooms featured a different type of work, some accompanied by Romero's poems. Trenzando raíces (Braided roots) at the Art Gallery of York University, Toronto, Ontario (2018) was developed in collaboration with indigenous women from New Credit First Nation. They requested that one of the six pieces created remain at a ceremonial center in Mississauga. In 2018, Romero was featured as the fourth artist in the National Museum of Women in the Arts-organized New York Avenue Sculpture Project. Four sculptures of carved, painted tires were the first works to be specifically commissioned for the project. They address \\"themes of migration and movement\\". Entitled as a group Signals of a Long Road Together, they will be shown for a two-year period on New York Avenue in downtown Washington, D.C. Used car tires are carved, painted with metallic paint, and assembled into \\"totemic structures\\" that use interior lighting to increase visibility. Huellas y cicatricez (Traces and scars) is a 16-foot stack of four tires, carved with figures of running mothers and children, hand in hand. Movilidad y tensión (Mobility and tension) stacks eight-halves of tires, engraved with a blend of Islamic and European designs reminiscent of Mudéjar symbols from ancient Spain. In En cautiverio (In captivity) slender steel columns hold up two tractor tires, whose surfaces are painted with intertwining serpents. Movilidad en suspenso (Mobility in suspense) is an assembly of four tractor tires whose treads are decorated with traditional Mexican patterns. Romero has taken part in numerous collective exhibitions and her works are part of permanent collections worldwide, including the Daros Latinamerica Collection, Zurich, Switzerland; the Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection; Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA); the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, and the Phoenix Art Museum.  Day of the Dead installations Betsabeé Romero has created a number of installations focused around the Day of the Dead. The Day of the Dead is a holiday that takes place in Mexico and Central America on November 1 and 2 as a commemoration of the deceased. Its origins go back 3000 years, and reflect a fusion of pre-Hispanic culture and Catholic religion. In 2015 Romero created an installation for the Day of the Dead at the British Museum. In the Great Court, she created an altar dedicated to the Unknown Immigrant. She drew upon folk traditions of paper and metal art, creating cantolla hot air balloons shaped like skulls out of tissue paper and tin calacas skeletons to float above the Great Court. Hanging paper banners printed on papel picado were placed in the Round Reading room, and marigold serpents wound their way up the stairs. thumb|One of the 103 trajineras in Canto de Agua, Martínez / Secretaría de Cultura CDMX Betsabeé Romero's installation Canto de Agua (Song of water) was held in the Zócalo of Mexico City (2016), and opened by the mayor of Mexico City, Miguel Ángel Mancera. The installation combined the cultural traditions of the Day of the Dead ofrenda or offering; the trajinera, a traditional type of flat-bottomed boat; and the social concerns of the present. 103 trajineras were decorated as offerings to commemorate those who had died during the year and to connect their deaths to social conditions and problems of Mexico City. The trajineras were created by Mexican artisans from Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl and reflect traditions of pre-Hispanic times in which trajineras circulated in Tenochtitlán. Los huesos tienen memoria (Bones have a memory) at the Museo Dolores Olmedo (2016–2017) was dedicated to the almost 28 thousand missing persons registered by the Mexican federal government. Romero incorporated modern elements inspired by the lamps Dolores Olmedo made of Bohemian glass for her home. Romero used flaked wax and tin and sugar skulls to create lights, which she sees as representing the light of living traditions that illuminate society. Fabric banners were reminiscent of pre-Hispanic codices like the Codex Borgia. Arrays of sugar skulls recall Mesoamerican skull racks or Tzompantli where the skulls of sacrifices were exhibited.

Education and career Morris was educated at Epsom College in Surrey and a school at Laugharne in Wales, before matriculating in 1843 at Oriel College, Oxford. He graduated there in 1848 after a leave of absence of a year and a half in 1846–1847 due to his family's financial difficulties connected with the Great Famine. Three years after leaving Oxford, he entered the King's Inns in Dublin as a law student. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1852 and was called to the Irish bar in 1854. He became a professor of common and criminal law in the King's Inns in 1862. In 1863 he was appointed Special Commissioner of Irish Fisheries but was compelled to resign due to a differing opinion with Sir Robert Peel. Morris married in 1858 and through his wife's inheritance became owner of the Gartnamona estate. Morris, an acquaintance of Henry Reeve, contributed articles on history and other subjects to the Edinburgh Review and, less often, to the English Historical Review. He also reviewed books on military history for The Times. As a landlord he was keenly interested in land tenure in Ireland, and the Land Act of 1870 incorporated many of his ideas. He was appointed a county court judge for County Louth in 1872 and after six years was transferred to County Kerry. At his own request he was transferred in 1886 to the county judgeship of the united counties of Sligo and Roscommon and thereafter devoted most of his efforts to literary work.

It is Arden's debut novel, and the first novel in the Winternight trilogy. The Bear and the Nightingale is set in medieval Russia and incorporates elements of Russian folklore. The central character is a young girl, Vasya Petrovna, who is able to communicate with mythological creatures, at a time when Orthodox Christianity is attempting to stamp out all belief in such beings.  Synopsis   Plot  The novel begins with an introduction of Pyotr Vladimirovich's household. Pyotr is a Russian boyar, the lord of a remote village, Lesnaya Zemlya, on the outskirts of the forests. His wife, Marina Ivanovna, the daughter of the Grand Prince of Moscow, Ivan I, and their four children, Kolya, Sasha, Olga and Alyosha are huddled around the kitchen oven being told the story of the frost-demon by their housekeeper and nanny, Dunya. This story tells the tale of Morozko, the frost king. Once the children have fallen asleep, Marina makes her way to her bedroom where she informs her husband, Pyotr, that she is once again pregnant. This poses an issue to the family because Marina is not expected to live through another pregnancy. However, she is determined to see through the birth of her fifth child because she can sense that this daughter will have powers that Marina's mother is believed to have had. To her family's grief, she indeed dies in childbirth, and her daughter is named Vasilisa, nicknamed Vasya. As Vasya grows older, she begins to spend more time in the forest. However, while she is exploring one day, she comes across an unusual tree that she does not recognise. At the foot of this tree lays a man with a missing eye. Before he can take an interest in her, another strange man on a horse arrives warning Vasya to leave and instructing the one-eyed man to go back to sleep because it is still winter. Vasya gets lost in the woods and is found by her older brother Sasha who is out with the search party looking for her. Once Sasha and Vasya return home, Sasha warns his father that Vasya needs a mother to look after and raise her. Pytor takes on this advice and travels to Moscow, taking Kolya and Sasha with him. While in Moscow, Sasha meets a local monk who makes a good impression and returns to ask his father if he can leave and spend his time at the Christian monastery. Pyotr makes a deal with his son that he can only go if he agrees to stay at home for one more year so that he is sure of his decision and not swayed by the monk. Pyotr is also successful in finding a wife for himself. The Grand Prince of Moscow, Ivan II, presents his young daughter, Anna Ivanovna, to Pyotr. Anna also has the ability to see mythological creatures, however is convinced that they are devils and that she is being punished by God. As a result, there are whispers from others living in the castle that she is either a witch or crazy, so the Grand Prince sees this as a way to get her out of the public eye. After making their way back to Lesnaya Zemlya, Pyotr also informs his daughter Olga of his success in finding her a husband in Moscow and that Anna is now their step mother. Once Anna realises that Vasya can also see the creatures, but is not afraid of them, she becomes convinced that Vasya is a witch on the side of evil and when the new, young and handsome priest, Konstantin Nikonovich, arrives they plan to ensure that every individual in Lesnaya Zemlya is convinced of Christianity and turns their backs on folklore and traditions of leaving offerings for little creatures believed to be safe guarding their village from the evil bear, Medved. However, in doing this, the creatures soon disappear as their offerings deplete and Lesnaya Zemlya is left defenseless. Meanwhile, Medved has been released and has convinced Konstantin that he is the voice of God. Konstantin, convinced that God is giving him his orders directly, agrees to Medved's demands to sacrifice a witch. While Pyotr is away, Konstantin and Anna hatch a plan to send Vasya to a convent by convincing the village people that she is a witch. However, in the midst of all the madness that arises, Vasya escapes into the forest, where she is taken under the wing of Morozko, the frost demon, who then reveals that he is the brother of Medved and is tasked with keeping him locked up for as long as he can. While in the care of Morozko, Vasya meets Solovey, an intelligent horse, with whom she bonds. Meanwhile, Medved has realised that Vasya has been taken in by Morozko and convinces Konstantin to persuade Anna to follow him into the forest. Once he does this, Medved reveals himself to Konstantin as the evil bear and kills Anna, wholly resolving him of his shackles. Despite this, Pyotr appears in the forest and offers himself to Medved in place of Vasya. This sacrifice once again bounds Medved, returning him to endless slumber beneath the unusual tree. As the novel concludes, Vasya convinces her brother, Alyosha, that she must leave and allow him to establish himself as a man among men and that her presence will only affect him negatively, being a witch-woman. She and Solovey ride into the forest and she finds Morozko in his home.  Major Characters  1932\\\\.

Illustration of a leshy in the forest. The Bear and the Nightingale is Arden's debut novel and was published in January 2017 by Del Rey Books. Arden completed her diploma in French and Russian literature before moving to Hawaii for 6 months while writing her novel. Her fascination with Russian literature and history prompted her to write a novel that was set in medieval Russia. According to Arden, her appeal with this subject stems from a young age. In an interview with CNET she revealed that she had read Russian fairytales as a child. The novel tackles issues such as gender and women's roles. Being set in medieval Russia, Arden challenges these issues in her novel and this is noted in her interview with BookPage as Ping states, “Vasya is a truly compelling heroine. She is strong enough to embrace her differences, but she still reads as a woman of her time”. Arden confirms this and explains her difficulty in balancing what she believed was right and what her character believed was right in medieval Russia. Arden also weaves a mix of Russian folklore and Slavic mythology into the narrative. She tells the tale of the intertwining but conflicting beliefs of tradition and religion by incorporating characters such as the ambitious priest, Konstantin Nikonovich and enchanting fairy-tale creatures. Vasya is used as a medium to explore the interactions between these opposing philosophies. These creatures include: * Domovoy: the household spirit who lives within the boundaries of the household. In the novel, the domovoi is depicted as the guardian of the home, placated with food offerings in return for protection. Illustration of a bannik by Ivan Bilibin. * Rusalka: a water spirit that can be found around lakes. They come in the form of women and their aim is mainly to entice men. In the novel, the rusalka is the first creature to warn Vasya of the priest's danger to the way of life of the villagers. * Leshy: forest spirits who hide in tall grass and enjoy playing tricks on people wading through forests. * Bannik: bathhouse spirits. The bannik in the bathhouse where Anna Ivanovna lived before marrying Pyotr would scare her so much she would refuse to bathe for weeks at a time until she was forced by her stepmother. * Dvorovoi: the household yard spirit. The dvorovoi spend their time in the stables and yards of houses. The dvorovoi play a significant role in the novel by warning Vasya of their fleeting time left due to the depleting offerings left by the villagers. * Vodianoy: a male water spirit. They are vengeful creatures who enjoy drowning people. They are typically considered the male version of rusalkas. When asked why she incorporated so many myths and legends into her novel Arden responded, “Slavic paganism never really disappeared from the Russian countryside after the arrival of Christianity; rather they coexisted, with some friction, for centuries. I was fascinated by the tensions inherent in such a system”.  Publication  The Bear and the Nightingale was released in early January 2017, followed by the sequel The Girl in the Tower, which was released in December 2017. The final novel of the series, The Winter of the Witch, was released in January 2019. The series is being published by Del Rey, an imprint of Penguin Random House Company. The Bear and the Nightingale was awarded Amazon's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of 2017 and nominated for Goodreads Choice Awards Best Fantasy 2017 and Goodreads Choice Awards Best Debut Goodreads Author 2017. The Bear and the Nightingale has also been published in paperback, hardcover, ebook and audio editions. Official translations include Bulgarian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Serbian, Croatian, Hungarian, Persian, Spanish, Turkish, Chinese, Czech and Russian.  Reception  The Bear and the Nightingale has been received positively by critics and reviewers. Publishers Weekly claimed “The stunning prose (“The blood flung itself out to Vasya’s skin until she could feel every stirring in the air”) forms a fully immersive, unusual, and exciting fairy tale that will enchant readers from the first page\\" Similarly, the Washington Post applauded the novel, > The novel is deceptively simple, but its characters and plot are > sophisticated and complex. Arden explores what happens when fear and > ignorance whip people into a furor, and how society can be persuaded to act > against its own interests so easily”. Some critics were disappointed with the later chapters of the book. In an otherwise glowing review, fantasy writer and critic Amal El-Mohtar finds fault in the book's conclusion, for a \\"mishmash of affect and style, and an ending that undercuts much of its former power.\\" Similarly, writer and book reviewer Caitlyn Paxson finds that \\"plot decisions and character developments veer down the path of least resistance\\" in the end of a book she would still \\"happily recommend.\\"  References  Fantasy novel series American fantasy novels Historical fantasy novels Young adult fantasy novels 2017 fantasy novels Slavic mythology in popular culture ","title":"The Bear and the Nightingale"},{"id":"58799760","text":"This is a list of player transfers involving Pro14 rugby union teams between the end of the 2018–19 season and 12 March 2020.

The technology helps to maintain systems in their optimum working conditions and is useful especially for multi-user computing environments. Deploying solutions based on Reboot to Restore technology enables users to define a particular system configuration as the desired state. The baseline is the point that would be restored on reboot. Once the baseline is set, the Reboot to Restore software continues to restore that particular configuration every time the device is restarted or switched on after a shutdown.  How it works  A reboot to restore software helps in maintaining optimal system configuration which is quite effective in a multi-user computing environment. The technology prevents all types of alterations to the baseline configuration whether user inflicted or automatic. Alterations by end-users are primarily changes to system settings, installing or uninstalling of software or applications, enabling or disabling specific functionalities, and so on. The automatic alterations include cookies, add-ons and browser extensions, and several types of temporary files that often get downloaded at the background during an online session. It also rolls back malicious alterations made by malware that elusively penetrate into a system and attempts to corrupt it.  Uses  Reboot to Restore software solutions were built to simplify the process of maintaining optimal system configuration of devices in a multi-user computing environment such as public libraries, computer labs in educational institutes (such as K-12, colleges, universities) or training centers, public access kiosks, and so on. Due to constant use by multiple people for a wide range of purposes, these devices become susceptible to performance deterioration and malware infiltration. During events of system malfunction or failure, it takes a considerably longer time to troubleshoot the issue using conventional practices like resetting or reimaging. This may lead to prolonged downtime causing poor user experience, potential loss of business opportunity, and higher maintenance costs. The Restore on Reboot functionality ensures that the best system configuration (pristine state) is maintained in every public- access computer without the long-drawn troubleshooting steps. The instant restoration technology empowers end-users to resolve system issues by simply restarting the device which significantly reduces intervention by IT. End- users experience optimum system performance as the pristine configuration is restored with every reboot. The technology helps to deliver maximum system uptime which improves operational efficiency and resource utilization. System administrators at corporates deploy reboot to restore solutions to create prestige environments without the need for constant troubleshooting. They use the software to protect the system drive and allocate a separate data partition where user and application data can be stored or redirected.  Software built on reboot to restore technology   Windows SteadyState  Initially named Shared Computer Toolkit, Windows SteadyState is a freeware Reboot to Restore solution offered by Microsoft and is compatible with Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems. Windows SteadyState was discontinued in December 2010. The software is primarily used in educational institutes and public libraries. SteadyState features a Windows Disk Protection (WDP) functionality. When it is enabled, it redirects the user-generated changes to a cache. The software had three modes—Discard, Persist, and Commit. The Discard mode clears the cache on reboot and restores the original configuration. The Persist mode retains the cache for a specific time during which the IT admins could opt to discard or commit the changes. In the Commit mode, all changes are permanently written on the hard disk as usual.  Deep Freeze  Deep Freeze by Faronics was one of the first rollback software solutions to leverage the Reboot to Restore technology, releasing its first Windows solution in 1999, followed by a Mac OS solution in 2005. Deep Freeze uses patented technology (, , , ) and redirects information being written to the hard drive or partition to an allocation table, leaving the original data intact. The redirected information on the allocation table is no longer referenced once the computer is restarted, therefore restoring the computer back to its original state at the disk sector level down to the last byte. Extending the functionalities of the reboot to restore technology, the software has the provision of ThawSpaces or Thawed Partitions for permanently saving user-generated data without altering the baseline configuration. ThawSpace is a virtual space that system administrators can create within the Deep Freeze ecosystem if the hard disk does not have a partition. Content stored in the ThawSpace is retained across reboots. Thawed Partitions are the parts of a hard disk that are exempted from the effects of Reboot to Restore technology.  Other system restoration software  Both Microsoft and Apple Inc. offer restoration tools (though not based on Reboot to Restore technology) embedded with their respective operating systems.  Windows System Restore  System Restore is an inbuilt feature of Windows and is available in all the latest versions of the OS. It reverts system files and settings to a previous point in time without affecting personal files. When enabled, the software automatically creates Restore Points at regular intervals and before every major instance of configuration alteration like driver update or new application installation. When a device malfunctions, running System Restore rolls back the configuration to a Restore Point where the particular issue did not exist.  Reset (Windows 8)  The Reset option was introduced with Windows 8 and is used for restoring systems to factory defaults. It re-installs the Windows OS and permanently discards all files and system settings other than the pre-installed applications.  Time Machine  Time Machine (macOS) functions more as a backup utility than a restoration program. It creates incremental snapshots of the system configuration periodically and requires an external storage device for backing up the MacOS. This backup can later be used to restore a previous configuration as and when required. The software can also be used to restore specific items like deleted emails or older versions of files rather than the entire configuration.  Refresh  Also introduced with Windows 8, Refresh re-installs the Windows OS but retains user files, the pre-installed applications, and those installed by the users. Running the reset option is advised only if Refresh fails to resolve the issue.

Its maximum apparent visual magnitude is 6.6, so it can be seen by the naked eye under very favourable conditions. The brightness varies slightly following a periodic cycle of approximately 5.23 days. The stellar classification of this star is B9IIIpSi, where the pSi suffix indicates that the star shows peculiar chemical composition with stronger than usual silicon lines. This type of star is known as an Ap star, with the chemical peculiarities caused by strong magnetic fields and slow rotation leading to chemical stratification in the atmosphere. The star is rotating at a projected rotational velocity of 49 km/s, with up to 0.05 magnitude variation of brightness during one rotation cycle. This leads to the classification of the star as an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable. The variability of QV Andromedae was first identified in 1975, and confirmed from Hipparcos photometry. It was assigned the variable star designation QV Andromedae in the 73rd namelist of variable stars in 1997.

It was designed by Walter Leslie and built from 1926 to 1930 by W. Robins. It is also known as Saint Sophia Cathedral, the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia), the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom and the Cathedral of God's Wisdom. The property is owned by Greek Orthodox Community of NSW. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 March 2016.  History  The site where Saint Sophia Cathedral now stands was originally part of the Sydney Common, between the present site of Centennial Park and Oxford Street. It passed through several periods of ownership including the Wesleyan Association (1866-1908) and the Jewish Society (1914-1923). The Greek Orthodox Community NSW (established 1898) has been and continues to be responsible for the management and maintenance of the Saint Sophia Cathedral, as well as the Holy Trinity Church, the first Greek Orthodox Church in Australia (consecrated 1898), located in Bourke Street, Surry Hills and the Assumption of the Virgin Mary Church (consecrated 1956), located in Abercrombie Street, Redfern.Greek Orthodox Church in Australia, 2016, 2 Orthodoxy arrived in NSW in the mid-to-late nineteenth century when significant numbers of Greek, Lebanese and Russian immigrants made their way to Australia from their homelands. The early migrants were attracted to Australia for a number of reasons, but particularly by the prospect of a new land and the chance to better their lives by amassing their fortunes in a developing settlement. Although the Lebanese migrants made a more permanent move by bringing their families and culture with them, the Greek migrants saw their Australian experience as a temporary measure to build their financial security before returning home to the Motherland and their families in Greece. As such, these migrants were largely young single men with no intention of settling in Australia or at least not until they were financially well established and could bring their wives and families from Greece to join them. For the majority, however, Australia was a place where they could make a fortune and then return to Greece to enjoy the hard-earned fruits of their labour. When some did return home to Greece, news of Australia spread and chain migration began with family and friends of migrants going abroad to join them. As migration continued, a community developed in Australia with the implementation of the necessary organisations and structures needed to support the new immigrants who were still, overwhelmingly, single men with little to no understanding of the language and with few marketable employment skills. This institutional structure was important to the new migrants in helping them get established in a new country and integrate into their own community and the broader Australian society while maintaining their traditions, values and cultural identity. The migration experience was a binding force within these communities and these newly-established institutions were able to provide food, shelter, supplies and a stable family-type environment for the migrants that followed. These strong connections promoted ethnic unity and enabled the newly-settled communities to sustain the cultural and religious practices brought with them from their homeland, as well as being an inclusive unit that could withstand the cultural and social isolation of the new country. Through the assistance of these communities, the new migrants tended to settle in clusters and, with the Greek and Lebanese communities, these areas were Surry Hills, Waterloo and Redfern (which was to become the hub of Orthodox immigration by the late nineteenth century). Religious institutions were particularly important in the experiences and settlement of the new immigrants in Australia. In the very early days of the migration of Orthodox Greeks, Lebanese and Russians, there were no dedicated churches in which the migrants could worship but the celebration of major religious holidays (particularly Christmas and Easter) did continue through makeshift services being conducted by travelling priests. For the continuation of the Orthodox faith, however, this pattern of worship was far from ideal and, in 1897, the Sydney Greek Orthodox Community (now the Greek Orthodox Community of Sydney and NSW) was established with the intention of constructing the first dedicated Greek Orthodox church to service the needs of the growing community. The first of its kind in Australia, the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church (Ayia Trias) was established in Surry Hills in 1898. The faith of the early Greek settlers in Australia came largely under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem followed by the Church of Greece. However, due to a change in spiritual leadership within the community in 1924 with the arrival of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, tensions began developing within the Greek Australian Orthodox community. Divisions began to form between those supportive of change and those against and quickly the social and political schism within the community grew. In 1924, as the schism reached its defining point, the Patriarchate established the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Australia and New Zealand (which was later elevated to the Archdiocese of Australia in 1959) and began leading religious services away from Sydney's centre for the Greek Orthodox faith at Ayia Triada, Surry Hills (Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church). The new metropolis looked to establish its own centre and fundraising began for the erection of a new church, the Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral (Ayia Sofia) in South Dowling Street, Paddington. Purchased from the Jewish community, the cathedral was built in 1927, opened for worship later that year and consecrated in 1928. The Cathedral was purpose-built and named after the Byzantine Saint Sophia or Holy Wisdom Church in Istanbul. The Greek Orthodox Community NSW, established in 1898, presided at the consecration of Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1928.Greek Orthodox Community NSW, 2016, 3 The great schism of Greek Orthodoxy in NSW continued for many years despite significant efforts to reconcile the opposing factions. After a prolonged period of co- existence, however, the two churches were finally reconciled into the one Community, the Greek Orthodox Community of Sydney and NSW, in April 1945. In 2015 an application was made to list the Cathedral as a heritage building by the NSW Government and this was approved. On 19 June 2016, the day of the commemoration of Saint Sophia, the NSW State Minister of Heritage, the Honourable Mark Speakman presented the Heritage Award to Harry Danalis, President of the Greek Orthodox Community NSW.Greek Orthodox Community NSW, 2016, 2 In 2008 The City of Sydney and Woollahra Councils officially named the crossroads of Oxford Street, South Dowling Street, and Darlinghurst Road, Three Saints Square recognising the Saint Sophia Cathedral, Saint Vincent's Hospital and University of Notre Dame Australia.  Description  Siting Located on the prominent Paddington corner of South Dowling and Napier Streets, the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) incorporates two buildings: the 1927 cathedral (fronting South Dowling Street) and the hall (behind the cathedral, fronting Napier Street). Cathedral exterior Constructed in the Inter-war Academic Classical architectural style, the landmark cathedral building has a symmetrically composed facade behind four fluted Ionic columns. The pediment over the entrance to the cathedral contains the inscription \\"Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia\\". The exterior of the hall building also reflects the same Inter-war Academic Classical style as the cathedral. The rendered brick building demonstrates a similar classical facade with fluted pilasters. The parapet above the entry to the hall is inscribed with \\"Saint Sophia Hall\\". Interior Internally, the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia contains dominant design elements influenced by the Byzantine architectural style. Not evident from its external elevations, the cathedral incorporates a centralised domed cupola above the nave, under which hangs the main chandelier. The cupola symbolises the sky and is aesthetically influenced by the Byzantine-style dome. The interior of the cathedral, much like other Greek Orthodox places of worship, is richly embellished with framed icons, wall paintings depicting saints, furniture and chandeliers. Internally, the hall underwent substantial changes in the 1970s which resulted in the installation of the mezzanine, the upper level windows and the office spaces.  Condition  As at 6 January 2006, the cathedral and hall buildings are in very good condition and the ongoing maintenance is most likely a result of its continuous use since 1927. The cathedral retains a substantial proportion of its original fabric. The hall building underwent significant changes to its internal spaces during the 1970s with the installation of its mezzanine floor and office fit out. At the same point in time, the fenestration of the external facade was rearranged and the upper level windows installed.  Modifications and dates  Internally, the hall underwent substantial changes in the 1970s which resulted in the installation of the mezzanine, the upper level windows and the office spaces.  Heritage listing  As at 7 August 2015, the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) is of state heritage significance as the first Greek Orthodox cathedral built in NSW, Australia and the southern hemisphere. The first place of worship built as a result of the great social and political schism within the Greek-Australian Orthodox community of 1924, the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) became the second dedicated centre for worship for the Greek Orthodox community in NSW. Since its construction in 1927, the cathedral has played an important role in the settlement of immigrant communities in Sydney, becoming a focal point for the social, cultural, education and philanthropic life in the community, and today the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) continues its original purpose as a spiritual centre for Christian Orthodox worship in NSW. Richly embellished with iconography and incorporating the centralised domed cupola above the nave (demonstrating the sky), the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) is largely influenced by the architectural legacy of the Byzantine style and is a representative example of the architectural style used for Orthodox places of worship across the world. Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 March 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) is of state significance for its association with the Greek migrants who arrived in Australia following World War I and for the significant Greek-Australian community that continue to worship at the cathedral. Religious institutions have long been a significant aspect of the Greek-Australian experience and churches have provided a stable and reliable meeting place where communities can practice and maintain their spirituality, traditional culture, values and language. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. A landmark set of Inter-war Academic Classical buildings straddling the prominent corner of South Dowling and Napier Streets in Paddington, the architectural style of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) and the Saint Sophia Hall are influenced by the architectural legacy of the Byzantine style. Not evident from its external elevations, the cathedral incorporates a centralised domed cupola above the nave, under which hangs the main chandelier. The cupola symbolises the sky and is aesthetically influenced by the Byzantine-style dome. The interior of the cathedral, much like other Greek Orthodox places of worship, is richly embellished with framed icons, wall paintings, furniture and chandeliers. The cathedral also includes a detailed iconostasis separating the nave and sanctuary. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) is of state heritage significance for the important role it continues to have in the lives of the Greek Orthodox community in NSW. Churches have been a significant aspect of the Greek- Australian experience since the first immigrants settled in Australia in the mid-to-late 19th century. With a significant influx of Greek immigrants settling in NSW following World War I, the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) became a focal point for the social, cultural, education and philanthropic life in the community. The cathedral was an important place where the Greek community could meet, maintain their Christian Orthodox faith and continue the customs, traditions and language of their homeland. Today the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) continues its original purpose as a spiritual centre for Christian Orthodox worship in NSW and a social hub for the Greek-Australian community. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The internal space of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) is highly embellished with iconography and ecclesiastical furniture that could provide further insight into the Christian Orthodox practice. It is considered that the potential for new information would be limited to the general practice of worship more so than revealing previously unknown information about the heritage value of the cathedral building. There is also potential for archaeological exploration of this site to reveal evidence of the earlier recorded uses of the site (boarding house, synagogue). The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) is not considered to be a rare example of its type as there are a number of Greek Orthodox churches throughout Sydney and NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Agia Sophia) is of state significance as a representative example of the Christian Orthodox churches that were built to service the needs of the community of NSW. The architectural style of the cathedral is representative of the layout of Orthodox centres of worship throughout the world. Incorporating the centralised domed cupola above the nave (to demonstrate the sky), the cathedral reflects the influence of the architectural legacy of the Byzantine style. The interior of the cathedral, much like other Greek Orthodox places of worship, also contains rich iconographic depictions on its walls and a detailed iconostasis separating the nave and sanctuary.

It was discovered in 2018 by analysing the redshifts of 10,000 objects observed with the Very Large Telescope in Chile. Discovery The discovery was announced in late 2018. The discovery team led by Olga Cucciati used computational astrophysics methods and astroinformatics; statistical techniques were applied to large datasets of galaxy redshifts, using a two-dimensional Voronoi tessellation to correlate gravitational interaction (virialization) of visible structures. The existence of non- visible (dark matter) structures was inferred. Correlation was based on redshift data captured in a sky survey called VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey, using the Visible Multi Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) instrument of the Very Large Telescope in Chile, and other surveys to a lesser extent. Spectroscopic redshift data for 3,822 objects (galaxies) was selected. The discovery was published in Astronomy & Astrophysics in September 2018. Physical description The structure is estimated to weigh 4.8 × 1015 solar masses (about 5,000 times the mass of the Milky Way) and to extend . It lies within the two square degree Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field of the constellation Sextans. Hyperion's redshift is z=2.45 putting it 11 billion light years from Earth; it existed at less than 20% of the present age of the Universe. Eventually it is \\"expected to evolve into something similar to the immense structures in the local universe such as the superclusters making up the Sloan Great Wall or the Virgo Supercluster\\". Use in cosmology The supercluster contains dark matter, evidenced by a mismatch between the visible objects in it and their computed gravitational binding. As a relic from the early Universe, the dark matter data could be used to test cosmological theories. As the 2018 paper authors note, \\"the identification of massive/complex proto-clusters at high redshift could be useful to give constraints on dark matter simulations\\" of the Lambda-CDM model.

It is an organometallic compound consisting of two cyclopentadienyl rings bound on a central zirconium atom. A crucial question in research is what kind of ligands can be used to stabilize the Cp2ZrII metallocene fragment to make it available for further reactions in organic synthesis.  Structure  In contrast to sandwich compounds that have parallel cyclopentadienyl rings bound on opposite sides of the metal atom, such as ferrocene, zirconocene and other group 4 metallocenes are bent. Without stabilizing ligands, the Cp2ZrII fragment is unstable and dimerizes to form a fulvalene complex.  History  In 1954, Wilkinson and Birmingham described zirconocene dihalides Cp2ZrX2 with X=Cl or Br, as some of the earliest examples of organozirconium compounds. The chemistry of Cp2ZrII- compounds was explored more extensively in the 1980s by Negishi, Takahashi, Buchwald, and others. In the 1990s, Rosenthal synthesized zirconocene reagents using bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene as stabilizing ligand. This novel zirconocene source offers a number of compelling advantages over previously used reagents and broadens the range of possible reactions. The chemistry of Cp2ZrII-compounds is still a rapid growing area with zirconium being ranked among the most widely used transition metals in organic synthesis.  Synthesis  The unstable 14-electron Cp2ZrII-compound is generally non- existent, but can be generated using ligands that stabilize the metallocene fragment. Optimally, these ligands can be quantitatively released under mild conditions. One option is the usage of π-acceptor ligands like carbon monoxide. Furthermore, a reaction with trimethylphosphine yields Cp2ZrII- complex as illustrated below. 382x382px In the synthesis of the Negishi reagent, treatment of zirconocenedichloride in tetrahydrofuran with two equivalents of n-butyllithium at −78 °C gives (1-butene)zirconocene, which is represented by the resonance structures A and B. 632x632pxIf bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene is used instead of n-butyllithium, a higher yield is can be obtained. In this case, zirconocene complexes are synthesized to Rosenthal's reagent, represented by the resonance structures A and B. This reagent is stable at room temperature, can be stored under an inert atmosphere and allows a more precise control over the stoichiometry of reactions as it can be formed quantitatively. A fine tune of the general reaction shown below is feasible by using different substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands as well as additional ligands (e. g. THF, pyridine). Instead of zirconium used as central atom, an analogous reaction with titanium is possible, too. 797x797px  Reactions  The highly reactive Cp2ZrII compound possesses one lone electron pair and two vacant valence orbitals. Therefore, it can be compared to carbenes in terms of its reactivity. Typical reactions of in situ generated zirconocenes are coupling or insertion to form metallacycles. These reactions have been observed upon addition of carbon monoxide, ketones, nitriles, alkynes and other substances and led to five-, seven- and nine-membered metallacycles.  Applications  Zirconocene coupling and insertion are used extensively to generate functionalized organic compounds. Taking Rosenthal's reagent, high yields of predictable macrocyclic products can be optained. These macrocycles are applicated in numerous ways, such as host–guest chemistry, chemical sensing, catalysis, and materials science. Moreover, with zirconocene complexes, the synthesis of so far unknown heterometallacycles and synthetically challenging organic structures can be realized by novel C-C coupling of nitriles.

Probably built in the mid-18th century, it is an extremely rare example of 18th-century stone residential construction in the state. The small structure may have originally been built as a farm outbuilding by a member of locally prominent Hinman family. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Plaster House is located in a rural setting of southeastern Southbury, on the south side of Plaster House Road near its western end at Jeremy Swamp Road. It is set on a parcel overlooking Jeremy Brook to the east. The house is a small 1-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of small rubblestone and covered in stucco. It has a gambrel roof pierced by two shed-roof dormers, with stone chimneys in the end walls. The main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows on either side of the entrance. The western gable is finished in stone, while the eastern one is framed in wood and finished in clapboards. The interior is divided into two chambers, with the larger one historically serving as a parlor and the smaller one as a kitchen. The stonework of the chimney and fireplaces are fully exposed, an unusual condition that appears to be original. With The house's exact construction date is unknown, but was probably no later than 1750, based on architectural evidence. Architectural historian J. Frederick Kelly assigned it a construction date of 1720, apparently without documentary evidence. The property was for many years in the hands of the Hinman family, who settled the area in the 17th century, and it is family lore that American Revolutionary War soldier [{Benjamin Hinman was born here. Jeremy Swamp Road, now a dirt track, was historically a major north-south route, and the property was associated with a mill whose remains are further downstream on Jeremy Brook, and whose dam makes up part of the bridge carrying Plaster House Road. The house is extremely unusual in the state due to its stone construction, which was uncommon in colonial Connecticut.

The church was designed by Edmund Blacket and the rectory was designed by John Burcham Clamp and built from 1848. It is also known as the Greek Orthodox Cathedral; St Paul's Anglican Church; St Pauls Church of England; Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady Theotokos. The property is owned by Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 April 2012.  History  Anglican church As the Sydney township expanded after the first phases of colonial settlement, the suburbs of Redfern and Chippendale were soon subdivided to accommodate the developing industry and population. To service these new communities, land was quickly selected and dedicated for the construction of essential government facilities - namely a church and school. By 1846, the prominent corner location had been selected for the construction of an Anglican church and, in 1847, Bishop William Broughton - Australia's first (and only) bishop - had awarded the commission of the construction to Edmund Blacket, the diocesan architect for the Church of England in Australia. Blacket had a particular interest in the gothic style of architecture and designed St Paul's Church in the Decorated Gothic form. During the colonial period, architecture was commissioned by the British settlers and was often designed to reflect the buildings of their homelands. The ecclesiastical building models were symbolic of Christianity and Blacket, in keeping with other colonial architects of the time, took inspiration from the design of established churches in England. The elevations and dimensions for St Pauls Church were taken from a lithograph of St Barnabas' at Homerton - designed by Arthur Ashpitel. Following the laying of the foundation stone on St Paul's Day in January 1848, construction of St Paul's Church soon followed but work proceeded slowly due to the economic depression in the colony and the high demand for skilled labour. Built in stages, the church was - in the most part - complete by its consecration in August 1855 but almost immediately underwent further expansion to accommodate the greater population numbers now residing in the Redfern and Chippendale areas. By 1858, the southern aisle of the church was complete and, by 1875, the tower was finished. During the second half of the nineteenth century, Redfern and Chippendale continued to be mixed suburbs of both residential and industry and it was not long before living conditions began to decline and these inner-city areas turned into slums. Efforts to improve these conditions were largely spurred by Reverend Francis Bertie Boyce who was appointed to the parish of St Pauls in 1884 (and who remained as an active and vocal leader for social reform until his retirement in 1930). A champion for clearing slums, improving living conditions, promoting pensions and alleviating working class distress, Boyce became a notable and innovative public figure in campaigning for the social improvement of his parish. By the outbreak of the Second World War, the population decline of Redfern and Chippendale was acute with its residents leaving for the new and expanding outer suburbs of Sydney. The ethnic composition of the inner-city was in a state of change and, into the newly vacated terraces, came the European migrants who had fled war-torn Europe. A new residential demographic saw a shift in the social demand for religion and the decline of the Anglican congregation and the rise of the Orthodox migrant settlers led to the sale of the church in 1967. Greek Orthodoxy in Sydney Orthodoxy been present in NSW since the nineteenth century and has been practised at a number of churches around Sydney before the establishment of the cathedral in Redfern. The Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church in Surry Hills, built in 1898, was the first of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere and practised under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Church of Greece, an autocephalous branch of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Following contentious disputes amongst the leadership about the direction of the church, the congregation split and the Cathedral of St Sophia (Ayia Sofia) was established in Paddington in 1927. After many years of tension between the churches and their prolonged period of co-existence, the two churches were finally reconciled in 1945 - a critical point in history when Australia was experiencing a steep increase in the numbers of Greek Orthodox migrants fleeing the war in Europe. The establishment of churches has always been a key element in the maintenance of faith and the provision of social support services to settling communities. With the migrant community growing steadily because of the government-assisted settlement after the war, the cathedral for Greek Orthodoxy was formed to become the focal point of cultural, education and philanthropic life in the community. Essential for the ongoing practice and celebration of their customs, traditions and language, the cathedral was an important support structure for the new communities settling and integrating into the Australian community. With the congregation swelling and the Cathedral of St Sophia's reaching its capacity, the proposal to purchase St Paul's Church in Redfern afforded the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese an opportunity to encapsulate a cathedral and the necessary institutional facilities all on the one site. By 1970, the church had been converted and re-consecrated as the Greek Orthodox cathedral. St Sophia's has since become a parish church. Today, the cathedral is internationally recognised as the seat of Greek Orthodoxy in Australia. It is home to the Greek Orthodox Archbishop and provides service for the most significant events within the church.Weir & Phillips, 2007.Tamis, 2005.Kerr, 1983.Whitington, 1936.Judd & Cable.Withycomb.Gilchrist, vols 2 & 3.Tsingris, 1998.  Description  Positioned on a visually prominent site, the cathedral was built in the Colonial Decorated Gothic style. A sandstone construction with slate covered timber roof, the building also consists of a square tower surmounted by an octagonal turret, with a nave, two wide aisles, chancel, two vestries and two porches. It has been noted that the landmark design of this building is reflected in its positioning and the alignment between the parapet and that of St Paul's College at the University of Sydney (also an Edmund Blacket design). The architectural form, elevation and dimensions of the cathedral were taken from a lithograph of St Barnabas' at Homerton - designed by Arthur Ashpitel. Using English architectural patterns for inspiration was a common practice for colonial architects in Australia. The cathedral is supplemented by a number of later buildings on the site. The former rectory (1912) was enlarged after the site's conversion to Orthodoxy to include a second storey and is now used as office and meeting space for the Archdiocese. Later buildings on the site (from the 1980s and 1990s) include the library, stores, Archbishop's residence and St Andrew's Greek Orthodox Theological College.  Condition  As at 14 November 2011, the church is in very good condition and its ongoing maintenance is most likely a result of its continuous use since 1855. Despite some internal modifications to convert the former Anglican church into its current use as the Greek Orthodox Cathedral, the building is in very good condition and retains much of its integrity and intactness.  Modifications and dates  *1911 - Government resumption of acres of church land to widen adjacent railway tunnel resulted in demolition of school (1854) and rectory (1864) *1912 - construction of new rectory *1913 - minor works to church (under direction of Blacket & Sons Architects) included addition of stone vestry, re-slating of roof and probable addition of ventilation cowels *1967-70 - internal alterations to conform to Greek Orthodox liturgy *1970 - ikonastasis installed *1980s/90s - construction of surrounding buildings on site * - rectory enlarged with second storey  Heritage listing  As at 15 October 2012, the Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady is of state heritage significance as an important early ecclesiastical design in the architectural career of Edmund Blacket. Originally St Paul's Anglican Church, its Decorated Gothic design became one of the established architectural models for parish church construction throughout NSW. This item is also significant as the Greek Orthodox Cathedral for Australia and for its association with the migrant communities that settled in NSW following the Second World War. Establishing churches and maintaining the orthodox faith has always been a significant aspect of the Greek-Australian experience and, since the conversion and re-consecration of the church to the Orthodox faith in 1970, the cathedral has become a centre for worship and the continuity and celebration of Greek customs, traditions and language. The former Anglican church also has a significant association with Reverend Francis Bertie Boyce, who resided over the parish from 1886 until his retirement in 1930. A notable and active leader for social reform, Boyce used his political connections to campaign for clearing slums, improving living conditions, promoting pensions and alleviating working class distress within the Redfern/Chippendale parish. Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 April 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady is of state heritage significance as an important ecclesiastical design in the architectural career of Edmund Blacket. Blacket was the diocesan architect for the Church of England and was awarded three important commissions in the late 1840s - these being St Paul's in Redfern, Church of the Holy Trinity in Berrima and St Phillips in Church Hill. Blacket designed different Gothic forms for each of these churches and, in doing so, established the architectural model for parish church construction throughout NSW. This item is also significant as the Greek Orthodox Cathedral for Australia. Since its conversion and re-consecration to the Orthodox faith in 1970, the cathedral has become a cultural centre for worship, education and the continuity of Greek customs, traditions and language in Australia. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady has state heritage significance for its association with the migrant communities that settled in Australia following the Second World War. Establishing churches and maintaining the orthodox faith has always been a significant aspect of the Greek-Australian experience and with the settlement of a new population after the war, the formation of a cathedral for Greek Orthodoxy was of fundamental importance. The cathedral became the focal point of cultural, education and philanthropic life in the community and was essential for the ongoing practice and celebration of their customs, traditions and language. The building also has a significant association with the acclaimed colonial architect Edmund Blacket. Blacket was the diocesan architect for the Church of England and was awarded three important commissions in the late 1840s - these being St Paul's in Redfern, Church of the Holy Trinity in Berrima and St Phillips in Church Hill.

A notable and active leader for social reform, Boyce used his political connections to campaign for clearing slums, improving living conditions, promoting pensions and alleviating working class distress. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady has state heritage significance as an early example of Edmund Blacket's work as Diocesan Architect for the Church of England and as a largely intact example of his ecclesiastical designs in the Colonial Decorated Gothic style. Positioned in a visually prominent location, the design of this landmark church made use of an already popular architectural style that was a potent reflection of the buildings of Britain (of home). The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady has state heritage significance for the important role it continues to have in the lives of the Greek Orthodox community in NSW. Following the Second World War and the government-assisted migration program, a significant Greek community settled in NSW and the establishment of a cathedral was important as a place to meet, maintain the orthodox faith and continue the Greek customs, traditions and language. Churches have always been a significant aspect of the Greek- Australian experience and, with the settlement of a new population after the war, the cathedral became the focal point for the social, cultural, education and philanthropic life in the community. This social significance continues as the generations of migrant-descendants learn and celebrate their Greek identity. Today, the cathedral is internationally recognised as the seat of Greek Orthodoxy in Australia and provides service for the most significant events within the church. As the Greek Orthodox cathedral in Australia, this site has particular significance for those follow the Greek Orthodox faith. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Expansion of the adjacent railway facilities saw the resumption of acres of church land in 1911 - leading to the demolition of the school (1854) and rectory (1864). Further archaeological exploration of this site may reveal evidence of these earlier buildings. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This building may be considered rare as the seat of Greek orthodoxy in Australia but its design (originally as an Anglican church) is not particularly rare in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady is a representative example of Gothic-style churches designed by Edmund Blacket during his career as diocesan architect for the Church of England. During the colonial period, architecture was commissioned by the British settlers and was often designed to reflect the buildings of their homelands. The ecclesiastical building models were symbolic of Christianity and Blacket, in keeping with other colonial architects of the time, took inspiration from the design of established churches in England.

Published weekly on Tuesday, it has an estimated circulation of 13,240.  Ownership and history  The Saratoga News was founded in 1955 by Sherman and Wilma M. Miller. The paper was sold in 1973 to Suburban Newspaper Publishers Association group in Cupertino, headed by Mort Levine. It was sold again to the Meredith Corporation in 1978, then to ex- Meredith executive Terrence T. Donnelly and later to the Peninsula Times Tribune subsidiary of the Tribune Newspaper Company. In 1990, Metro Newspapers purchased the Saratoga News along with Los Gatos Times-Observer and Los Gatos Weekly, the latter of which had been founded by Metro CEO Dan Pulcrano in 1982. Under Metro, the Saratoga News enjoyed a decade-long run, its longest period of local ownership other than that of the Millers. The community newspaper group adopted the name Silicon Valley Community Newspapers and purchased or started weeklies in Cupertino, Sunnyvale, Campbell and the Willow Glen district of San Jose. In 2001, Metro executive David Cohen purchased the Saratoga News as part of a management buyout of the community newspaper group. In 2005, Knight Ridder purchased the Saratoga News as part of its acquisition of the Silicon Valley Community Newspapers. In 2006, Knight Ridder was purchased by McClatchy Co., which immediately sold SVCN and the San Jose Mercury News to MediaNews Group. MediaNews Group is now known as Digital First Media. Silicon Valley Community Newspapers and the Saratoga News are published as part of the San Jose Mercury News. As part of its merger with San Jose Mercury News, Saratoga News is offered as part of a subscription model, rather than as a free weekly paper. The paper is currently published by the Bay Area News Group, which is owned by Digital First Media.

Construction of the bridge started in 1863 and finished in 1866. It was opened for public use in 1867. It is a double-decked steel truss bridge which runs across the Yamuna river in the eastern part of Delhi. The bridge runs east-west across the Yamuna river connecting the city of Delhi to its neighborhood of Shahdara. It was constructed in 1866 by the East India Railway at a cost of £1,616,335. It was built with a total length of 2,640 feet and consisted of 12 spans of 202.5 feet each. In the nineteenth century, two principal cities of North India, Kolkata and Delhi, were connected by railways, the bridge being the last link on this route. The bridge initially had a single line, and was later converted to a double line. There is a discrepancy about the year the second line was added; one source says that \\"In 1913, this was converted into a double line by adding down line girders of 12 spans of 202 feet each and 2 end spans of 42 feet to the bridge.\\" But another source says \\"It was built for a single railway line but converted into a double line in 1932 and reopened in 1934\\" because of increased traffic on this section. It has the capacity of serving roadways as well as railways simultaneously. The upper deck carries a two-lane railway line which connects Old Delhi railway station to Shahdra railway station, while the lower deck carries road traffic.

The book was published by Tor Books on October 16, 2018. Audible released an audio book version narrated by Wil Wheaton. It is the middle volume of a planned trilogy and a sequel to The Collapsing Empire; the third and final book, The Last Emperox, was published on 14 April 2020. Plot Following the events of The Collapsing Empire, End is now isolated from Hub as the result of a Flow shoal breakdown. Seeking to unite the population of the Interdependency behind an agenda to get ahead of the coming collapse of Flow-supported space travel, Grayland II (Cardenia Wu-Patrick) claims, in her capacity as head of the Church of the Interdependency, to have had visions affirming the need to plan for the collapse. This causes religious disquiet in the church, and political intrigue from the House of Nohamapetan and the House of Wu with the aim of claiming the throne from Grayland II through a coup d'etat. Meanwhile, Marce Claremont follows a lead provided by his erstwhile rival, the researcher Hatide Roynold, and together they learn that the Interdependency will once again be connected by Flow shoals in a different configuration on a timescale of hundreds of years, and that in the meantime evanescent shoals will appear and disappear. Seeking to learn more about the possibility of survival while cut off from other parts of the Interdependency, Marce and Hatide, accompanied by Marines, depart to study the survival of life on Dalasýsla, a system which was cut off for eight hundred years until the emergence of an evanescent Flow shoal. Kiva Lagos, meanwhile, deals with the aftermath of Nadashe Nohamapetan's actions. Tasked by Grayland II with the upkeep of the House of Nohamapetan's business affairs on Hub, Kiva becomes a hindrance to the Countess' plans for regaining wealth and political favour. When Grayland II shoots down the Countess' plans to regain control of her House, the Countess retaliates at Kiva with an attempt on her life. Kiva survives but her lover Senia, lawyer for the Nohamapetan house, is seriously injured. In response, Kiva assaults the Countess' chief of staff. Nadashe is covertly sprung from imprisonment through the efforts of the Nohamapetan and Wu conspirators, who stage the incident as a failed escape attempt with no survivors. Kiva, investigating the House of Nohamapetan's affairs, discovers clues pointing to Nadashe being alive. Marce and Hatide, while visiting Dalasýsla, meet survivors who have adapted to the changed conditions over hundreds of years. Coming under attack from Nohamapetan-hired mercenaries, Marce and a few members of his expedition manage to survive while the ship carrying Hatide and the rest of the expedition is destroyed. Marce returns to Hub with the help of Tomas Chenevert, a deposed king from outside the Interdependency who has had his consciousness transferred to a ship after his death. They return in time to witness Grayland II decide on a course of action in response to the anticipated coup d'etat attempt. Learning the identities of the traitors, she invites them to a party and proceeds to honour and promote her allies, Kiva and the Archbishop of the Church, and denounce and arrest the rest. The book ends with Marce offering a solution to the problem of getting the Hub population to End without coming under attack from Ghreni Nohamapetan and his allies, who strategically positioned themselves to control the passage to End in earlier events.

History The station is located on the former BOSM line north of Pasar Senen station, at the eastern end of the Weltevreden region. This station is named after the name of the surrounding residential area, established in the early 20th century. The station and track were taken over by Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen in 1898. Since being taken over by SS, Kemayoran station was later developed by SS. In 1902, a shortcut path from Kemayoran to Ancol was built, used to accelerate the flow of goods shipments to Tanjung Priok. With the operation of the electric locomotive and electric train (KRL) on the Batavia-Buitenzorg line in 1925, SS then planned the construction of a double track in almost all Jakarta crossings since 1926. As a first step, the first double track on the Batavia line was between Kemayoran – Batavia and Sawah Besar – Weltevreden.

The coat of arms of the city is blazoned as Party per fesse argent and azure, in chief a pile vair and on a canton gules a bell argent, in base a ship with sails set argent on waves of the sea proper. This heraldic language describes a shield that is divided in two horizontally (party per fesse). The top (chief) of the shield is silver (argent), and has a point-down triangle (a pile) with a repeating blue-and-white pattern that represents fur (vair). There is also a red square in the top corner (a canton gules) on which there is a silver bell. It is likely that the bell is an example here of \\"canting\\" (or punning) heraldry, representing the first syllable of Belfast. In the lower part of the shield (in base) there is a silver sailing ship shown sailing on waves coloured in the actual colours of the sea (proper). The supporter on the \\"dexter\\" side (that is, the viewer's left) is a chained wolf, while on the \\"sinister\\" side the supporter is a sea-horse. The crest above the shield is also a sea-horse. In the lower part, the coat of arms has the Latin motto \\"\\" in black on a white tape. This is taken from Psalm 116 Verse 12 in the Latin Vulgate Bible and is literally \\"For (Pro) so much (tanto) what (quid) we shall repay (retribuamus)\\" The verse has been translated in bibles differently – for example as \\"What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?\\".King James Bible, Psalm 116 Verse 12 It is also translated as \\"In return for so much, what shall we give back?\\" These arms date back to 1613, when King James I granted Belfast town status. The seal was used by Belfast merchants throughout the 17th century on their signs and trade-coins. A large stained glass window in the City Hall displays the arms, where an explanation suggests that the seahorse and the ship refer to Belfast's significant maritime history. The wolf may be a tribute to the city's founder, Sir Arthur Chichester, and refer to his own coat of arms. The elements that make up the arms of Belfast also appear on its flag.

Each book in the \\"library\\" has been donated by \\"someone who loves that book and thinks that other people might love it too\\". Notable book donors include Jay Rayner, Kate Raworth, Lemn Sissay, Ian McKellan, Chris O'Dowd and Suzanne Moore. The books can be taken out by the public and then passed on to other people, instead of being returned. A Thousand and One Books has been presented at London International Festival of Theatre in 2016, and at the Krasnoyarsk Book Culture Fair in 2016.  Human Library  Human Library is \\"like any other library but instead of borrowing a book you can borrow a person for conversation\\". The library presents a selection of \\"Living Books\\": people who tell a story about their life and discuss it with a member of the public visiting the installation. Each Human Library is centred around a different theme including fashion, food, home and age. Human Library has been presented in London at SOAS (2015), Whitechapel Gallery (2015), the London International Festival of Theatre (2016), and in Perth, Western Australia, at the Perth Writers Festival (2016). Empathy Museum's A Mile in My Shoes at The Migration Museum in London, 2018.  A Mile in My Shoes  A Mile in My Shoes is a travelling \\"shoe shop\\" with over 250 pairs of shoes and audio stories collected by the Empathy Museum. Visitors are invited to walk a mile in someone else's shoes by temporarily exchanging their footwear for a pair in the museum's collection. While walking, visitors listen to a story about the shoe owner's life through a pair of headphones. The project can be centred around certain topics. The Health Foundation commissioned a project around health and social care, The Entrepreneurial Refugee Network supported one on migration and The National Theatre of Scotland commissioned one based on the year of the young person. A Mile in My Shoes has been presented across England and internationally, including in Belgium (2017), Australia (2017), Ireland (2017), Brazil (2017), Scotland (2018) and the USA (2018), and most recently in 2019 in Denver, Colorado at the Biennial of the Americas, on the theme of \\"Empathy in Action,\\" featuring stories from Mayor Michael Hancock, poet Suzi Q Smith, writer & thinker Brenton Weyi and many other local storytellers.

It was the second female anti-slavery society in the city. One of its founding members was Elizabeth Buffum Chace (1806-1899).  Origins  The association formed after a controversy over interracial membership divided its predecessor, the \\"Fall River Anti Slavery Sewing Society.\\" Three free black women had been attending meetings and applied to join the Fall River Anti Slavery Sewing Society as real members. Some of the existing members, who were all white women, opposed the black women's inclusion. Elizabeth Buffum Chace, who supported the black women's petition to join, described the opposition as being preoccupied with custom and decorum: \\"they were willing to help and encourage them [the black women] in every way, but they did not think it was at all proper to invite them to join the society.\\"Elizabeth Buffum Chace, Anti-slavery Reminiscences Providence, Rhode Island: E.L. Freeman and Son, State Printers, 1891Halperin Earle, Jonathan. \\"Volume 28, Number 2\\" In Peculiarly Woman's Cause': Feminism, Race, and the Struggle for Equality. Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000. Elizabeth Buffum Chace, along with her sisters, allowed the black women to become members. Those who opposed the black women's admission left the society, and the group renamed itself, replacing the word \\"Sewing\\" in its name with the word \\"Female.\\" While the original society was focused on abolition of slavery, Elizabeth Buffum Chace and her sisters were interested in the ending of all racist practices, even outside of slavery.  Activities and the AntiSlavery Fair The Fall River Female Anti-Slavery Society held a regular fundraising fair to sell sewn and embroidered things with anti-slavery mottoes on them. This AntiSlavery Fair was a place where the members could sell the things they made within Fall River, or in Boston. Another way they would fund raise was to go around Fall River and ask other women to donate money to the society, so they were able to promote more anti-slavery texts. The group would read anti-slavery texts and discuss them together, as they sewed and embroidered; these were more acceptable female activities than fundraising. But there is also evidence of them creating a petition to Congress, as well as appealing to the other women of Fall River in their titles of wives, mothers, and daughters to learn about the truth of what was happening in the South, especially to enslaved women.  Connections to other abolitionist groups  There is a published account of a delegate from the Fall River Female Anti- Slavery Society attending the Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women in May, 1838, where a number of delegates from different female anti-slavery societies and groups came together in Pennsylvania to discuss the rights of African-American women. The delegates wrote on the subject of social activism and the abolishment of slavery. Sarah G. Buffman, the Fall River delegate, served as one of the four secretaries for the convention, and in that role she signed all three statements. Another delegate from Fall River, Laura Lovell, reported about various people speaking at the convention, including a free African American man telling his story, and poetry being read.* The Fall River society also created connections with female anti-slavery societies across New England including the New Bedford Female Anti Slavery Society, and the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, for example through letters between Elizabeth Buffum Chace and Maria Weston Chapman, the head of the Boston society.

In 1918, she became one of the first five women to be elected to the Landsting. She joined the Danish Women's Society in 1922, became a board member in 1925 and served as president from 1931 to 1936. Biography Born on 20 April 1869 in Bjerring, Fanny Marie Annette Raaschou was the daughter of Niels Peter Raaschou (1823–1890), a parish priest, and Fanny Eline Annette Grundtvig (1841–1879). She was brought up in her father's rectory, first in Bjerringbroegnen and later in Espe near Ringe on the island of Funen. As the oldest child, on her mother's death in 1879, she had to take care of her five siblings from the age of 10. After qualifying as a teacher at Marie Kruse's School in Copenhagen, she went on to study French in Paris (1894). On returning to Denmark, she became a private tutor until her marriage in 1898 to Carl Frederik Hjelmer, a high-ranking police official, with whom she had three children. While raising her children, she assisted her father by working in the municipal offices in Præstø, gaining insights into local politics. In 1907, she met Elna Munch, a women's rights activist. As a result, in 1907 she joined the Præstø's Women's Suffrage Society (Kvindevalgretsforening) where she became the most active member. In 1909, the year women were first authorized to participate in local elections, she succeeded in being elected to represent the Social Liberal Party on the Council for Præstø Municipality. She was re-elected until 1919 when her husband was transferred to Ringsted. In 1915, she became a member of the Danish Women's Society, first at the local level in Præstø and in Ringsted which she co-founded and chaired from 1922 to 1936. Encouraged by her political colleagues, in 1918 she was one of five women elected to the Landsting, the only female representative of the Social Liberals. She remained there for 18 years, supporting in particular improved conditions for women and children. She was also active at the international level, representing Denmark at the first conference of the International Labour Organization, held in Washington D.C. in 1919. In 1925, she became a board member of the Danish Women's Society, serving as president from 1931 to 1936. At a time when the organization was experiencing serious difficulties, she managed to reconcile the varying views of the younger and older members, paving the way for Edel Saunte to become president in 1936. She also contributed to the political image of the organization, contributing articles to Kvinden og Samfundet. After experiencing serious health problems during her last year, Marie Hjelmer died on 5 January 1937 in Ringsted.

The steamer, escorted by German minesweepers, ran from Biscay through the English Channel in 1942, en route to Rotterdam. She later operated in Norwegian waters, under German flag, before being sunk by RAF aircraft off Ålesund in 1944. Early career The freighter was built as Bolton Caste in the shipyards of William Hamilton & Company, Port Glasgow, and launched on 14 April 1914. The next month she was acquired by the Lancashire Shipping Company Ltd., from Liverpool, and the ship travelled the London-Genoa-Singapore- Manila-New York route. On 16 February 1916, while berthed at New York, Bolton Castle, along with the steamer Pacific were damaged when a fire that broke out in the port facilities spread to the barges in harbour, some of them loaded with ammunition and fuel, as part of a convoy to Vladivostok, Russia. The master, his wife and six members of the crew had a narrow escape, while one crewmember died in the accident. By October 1916, she was back on service, plying the America-Far East rout. In 1937 Bolton Castle was sold to Minerva Steam Ship Company from London. Italian service  The ship was bought by the Società Anonima di Navigazione Mare Nostrum, from Genoa, in 1939, and renamed Fidelitas. The merchant ship sailed on the route from Genoa to different ports in the Americas. On 10 May 1940, while arriving in Vlissingen, in the Netherlands, during a journey from New York to Antwerp, Fidelitas was bombed and hit by German Ju 88 bombers, which took her for an Allied ship. One sailor was killed and five wounded, but the vessel reached her port of destination the next day. With the German invasion of Belgium under way, Fidelitas was one of the few ships to remain in Antwerp at the time. Italy was still a neutral country. She left Antwerp on 15 May without unloading, only to be attacked twice, both by German Ju 87 dive bombers and coastal batteries. Two more crewmembers were killed, and the Italian merchant ship Foscolo, which was also steaming out of Antwerp, was sunk. Internment in Spain The next month, just a few weeks before Italy´s entry in World War II, Fidelitas was at anchor in the Irish port of Cork. After a brief stay at Dublin, the vessel reached Cardiff, where her master intended to resupply the ship with coal, food and fresh water, but she sailed away when the Italian consul in the city told the captain of the imminent declaration of war by Italy. Fidelitas hastily set sail to Corunna, where she arrived in on 10 June. The Italian consul informed the master at evening that Italy had declared war to France and Britain. Spanish authorities interned the ship and moved her to Ferrol, where she remained inactive with a skeleton complement of five. In March 1942, the ship was chartered by the German company DDG Hansa. A replacement crew arrived from Italy, and the ship was repaired and refitted first at Ferrol and later at Bilbao before sailing for Bordeaux with a cargo of iron ore. The merchant was fitted with mountings for antiaircraft guns, to be manned by German personnel. Blockade runner Having spent some months at Bordeaux, Fidelitas departed in July for Brest. There, the Italian vessel would be escorted by the German minesweepers Von der Groeben (M 107), V 1501, V 1506 and V 1809 through the English Channel.Frädrich and Naims (2003), p. 86 The scheduled destination was Rotterdam, with Cherbourg, Les Hardreaux, Le Havre, Dunkirk and Dieppe as ports of call.  Action of 17/18 August 1942  In anticipation of the pass of the Fidelitas and her escort, the Royal Navy sent six motor torpedo boats (MTBs) to lurk in an area between Calais and Gravelines, in a position east-southeast from South Foreland. The flotilla was made of MTB 218, MTB 219, MTB 24, MTB 38, MTB 43, and MTB 204. The convoy was shelled by 381 mm coastal batteries on their passage through Dover at midnight; the British admiralty reported that 26 rounds were fired on Fidelitas and her escorts. The same source said that German artillery bombarded South Foreland with 14 rounds from the French coast from 0:30 to 01:00. The Fidelitas convoy was engaged by the MTBs between Dover and Gravelines at 01:35. MTB 204 and MTB 38 attacked with torpedoes and even depth charges, claiming one torpedo hit on an escort vessel. MTB 43 was hit by the escorts and left on fire north of Gravelines; she eventually sank and most of her crew was rescued by MTB 24. MTB 218 was also struck by return fire, and lost two engines. The MTB was left adrift, and finally sank when she hit two mines while trying to limp away through a mined area. The action died down by 2:40. Six seamen were killed on MTB 218, another two on MTB 43 and another one aboard MTB 38. The battle was visible from Dover Castle. During the engagement Fidelitas master, Aldo Martinero, ordered full reverse just in time to dodge two torpedoes fired by the British MTBs. The convoy arrived unscathed in Dunkirk at 6:50. Journey to Norway and further operations at the North Sea After unloaded her cargo of iron ore and replenished at Rotterdam, Fidelitas carried out a new delivery mission from Rotterdam to Bergen, in Norway, passing across the Kiel Canal. From 1942 and into 1943, Fidelitas operates along the Norwegian coast, carrying supplies for the different German coastal garrisons in the region. On 10 April 1943, Fidelitas was part of a nine ship German convoy bound for Finnmark, shepherded by a mixed escort of eleven minesweepers and antisubmarine vessels.The ships survived the attack of a Soviet submarine and several aircraft of the same nationality before arrival. On 30 July 1943, a secret report from the Abwher at Wilhemshaven expressed their concerns regarding the loyalty of the Italian crew following the fall of Mussollini, fearing that the ship could try to defect to the Allies during a planned journey from Hamburg to Narvik. Under German flag The Italian ship was confiscated by German authorities on 8 September 1943, after the Cassibile armistice, and her complement was put under arrest. The Reichsverkehrsministerium (Minister of Transport) put the freighter under full control of the DDG Hansa. Captain Martinaro was replaced for Giacomo Piana, and the bulk of the crew was drafted from Italian sailors perceived as still loyal to Fascism and from anti-communist Russian and Ukrainians, plus German military personnel to man the ship's armament. The chief mate was also a German seamen. Fidelitas was subsequently designed to cover the route between Denmark and Norway. Sinking On 27 November 1944, while sailing in the Sunnfjord, barely 30 minutes after departing from Ålesund along with the German steamer Jersbek and four escorts, the convoy came under attack from RAF Beaufighters bombers from the 404th Squadron and Beaufighters torpedo-bombers from the 489th Squadron. While an escort minesweeper and Jersbek were engaged with rockets and damaged, Fidelitas was strafed with heavy machine guns and hit by two torpedoes. Loaded with heavy metals, the ship sank very quickly. The explosion of her boilers after the sinking is believed to have killed a number of survivors. Two Beaufighters were damaged by antiaircraft fire, but all the planes returned safely to their base. Only nine members of the complement were rescued. Captain Piana, German Commander Janssen, 16 Italian ratings, 13 German ratings, seven Ukrainians and one Norwegian sailor went down with the ship. Aftermath The ship sank at a depth of 95 mt, and her wreck was discovered in 1988. In 1995, the Norwegian minesweeper Tyr explored the wreckage area and filmed the merchant remains. She also recovered the ship's bell. Further searching claimed the lives of two divers. References Bibliography * Frädrich, Lothar, and Naims, Günther (2003). Seekrieg im Ärmelkanal.

The last date for the submission of technical bids was fixed as 30 May, and the MSRDC planned to open technical bids on 31 May 2014, as per the tender notice. The MSRDC estimated the project concession period to be 35 years in the absence of any viability gap funding (the state's financial contribution in a PPP project). However, after some members of the infrastructure sub-committee expressed reservations about the long concession period, the corporation decided to seek 20% from the Union government, which the MSRDC estimated would reduce the concession period to about 28–30 years.http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/msrdc-invites-pre- qualification-bids-for-bandra-versova-sea-link/ The Louis Berger Group was awarded a contract to provide project management services for the VBSL project in January 2018.

The MSRDC withdrew its special leave petition, and stated that it would it file a writ petition seeking permission from the High Court to set up the casting yard. If the petition is denied the agency will have to find alternate land for the casting yard, which would delay the start of construction. The agency filed a review petition with the High Court on 30 August. MSRDC officials stated that they were also exploring the possibility of renting land temporarily for use as a casting yard in case the review petition failed.

A depressed Moe then stops reacting angrily to Bart's prank calls, so Bart, Milhouse and Nelson decide to up their game by accessing the dark web with the help of Herman. They order a mail order wife for Moe, a beautiful woman named Anastasia who shows up at the bar. Moe denies sending for her but allows her to stay. She transforms the bar into a high-class establishment. Moe is smitten with Anastasia, but has had his heart broken too many times and refuses to become romantically involved, so she decides to move out and take a job at the Russian Tea House in Odgenville.

He and Marge interrogate Bart and threaten to destroy his phone until he confesses his dark web dealings. While Marge gives Bart a series of punishments, Homer rushes off to tell Moe the truth and encourage him to fight for Anastasia. He tracks her down to the Tea House she is working at, only to see her dating Krusty. With the encouragement of the barflies, he crashes their picnic date and confesses his love for Anastasia. She breaks up with Krusty and agrees to honor the contract. Bart is then cajoled into helping out at Moe and Anastasia's wedding, which Marge says will be Bart's last punishment. However, he, Milhouse and Nelson have learned Russian off the dark web and realize the marriage contract is actually a legal document giving Anastasia all the rights to Moe's property; and promptly expose this at the altar.

Webber Kelly (December 7, 1875 - August 3, 1951), born William Webber Kelly, was a prominent medical doctor in the state of Wisconsin known for being the third president of the Green Bay Football Corporation, the non- profit organization that owns the Green Bay Packers. Kelly was a practicing physician in the Green Bay, Wisconsin area for almost 50 years and a respected civic leader. During his one year as president of the Packers for the 1929 season, the team went 12-0-1 and won its first NFL Championship. Kelly was identified as part of The Hungry Five, a group of Green Bay businessmen who were instrumental in guiding the Packers through multiple financially challenging periods. In addition to his presidency, Kelly served as the team physician from 1921 to 1943 and as a member of the Packers' board of directors from 1923 to 1949. After a falling out with Packers co-founder, head coach, and general manager Curly Lambeau, Kelly resigned from the Board in 1949. Two years later he died of a heart attack at the age of 75. In recognition of his contributions, Kelly was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1994. Early life William Webber Kelly was born on December 7, 1875, in Kingston, Jamaica, when the Colony of Jamaica was part of the British West Indies. His parents were Captain Patrick Kelly and Mary Kelly; his father was a member of the British Army. Both of Kelly's parents were born in Ireland. After moving to England as a child, Kelly was educated at schools in Market Harborough and Nottingham. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1900 from Xaverius College in Belgium before serving in the British civil service in his hometown of Kingston, Jamaica. He moved to Montreal, Canada, to attend the University of Bishops (now called McGill University) where, in 1903, he received his medical degree after completing his internship at Westmont Hospital. He completed some post-graduate work in Vienna, Austria, before moving to the United States in 1903. Medical career After receiving his medical degree, Kelly opened his first practice in Flintville, Wisconsin. A few months later in 1904 he moved to Green Bay and partnered with another doctor to form a new practice. The partnership lasted five years before Kelly formed his own private practice again. In 1914, he was admitted to the American College of Surgeons following more post-graduate work in London, England. Kelly became a well-respected civic leader in Green Bay and was on staff at three local hospitals: St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center, Bellin Memorial Hospital, and St. Vincent Hospital. He also was a member of various medical societies, including as president of the Brown County Medical Society and the Fox River Valley Medical Society. He served on the Wisconsin State Board of Health for 12 years, including as president from 1937 to 1943. Kelly ended up practicing medicine for almost 50 years in the Green Bay area. Green Bay Packers Kelly was a prominent doctor and civic leader in Green Bay when the town had just over 20,000 residents. The first account of Kelly's involvement with the Green Bay Packers came in 1923; the Packers were set to play a team from Duluth, Minnesota when 12 hours of rain threatened to cancel it. If the game had been cancelled, the Packers would have still needed to pay the Duluth team, which would have been financially disastrous. Green Bay Press-Gazette owner Andrew B. Turnbull convinced Packers owners Curly Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun to play the game with the promise that he would rally local businessmen for financial support. Kelly, along with other local businessmen, cancelled a $2,500 debt that Lambeau had and then helped rally financial support from the community. They formed the Green Bay Football Corporation and sold 1,000 shares to local community members, converting the Packers ownership into a publicly held, non-profit corporation. Kelly was a member of the corporation's original executive committee and the Packers' board of directors. Kelly's role in reorganizing the ownership structure of the Packers and increasing community support for the team saw him identified as part of The Hungry Five. This group of five prominent Green Bay residents, which included Lambeau, Turnbull, Gerald Francis Clifford, and Lee Joannes, is credited with helping to keep the Packers in operation during its early years. Kelly would go on to serve on the Board of Directors from 1923 to 1949 and as team physician from 1921 to 1943. In 1929, he was elected as president of the corporation, a position he would serve in for only one season. The 1929 season was notable though as the Packers won their first NFL Championship by attaining an undefeated record of 12-0-1. After the seasoned ended, Kelly resigned as president so that he could focus on his presidency of the Green Bay Board of Education. He was well-respected around the National Football League (NFL), locally in the community of Green Bay, and by the team. However, the 1940s saw a power struggle between Curly Lambeau and the Board of Directors. Lambeau made multiple controversial moves as head coach and de facto general manager by firing publicist and co-founder George Whitney Calhoun and then removing Kelly as team physician. After the Board of Directors voted to extend Lambeau's contract another two years in 1949, Kelly announced his resignation. He resignation letter noted that he believed the Packers needed to be completely reorganized and that Lambeau was not the man for the job. He also felt that by leaving his position the Board would be able to act with complete harmony in future business decisions. Although not as well known as some of his colleagues, Kelly was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1994 in recognition of his various contributions as team physician, board member, and president. Personal life Kelly married Ida Nadeau, who was from Quebec, Ontario, in 1915. The couple lived in Green Bay after their marriage and had one daughter named Jacqueline. He was active in the Green Bay community, serving on the city's Board of Education as president from 1930 to 1933, the University of Wisconsin Board of Visitors from 1934 to 1938, and the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents from 1938 to 1940. He also was an organizer and supporter of the first Green Bay chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous and a member of the Knights of Columbus. Kelly died on August 3, 1951, at the age of 75 after suffering his second heart attack; his first occurred in 1942.

The controversial trend is generally described by publishers as a response to changes in social media traffic and changes in the media consumption habits of younger audiences. But according to commentators, it is in reality driven by advertising; only advertisers, not consumers, prefer video over text. Due to the numerous jobs lost as a result, the term eventually became a euphemism for layoffs, death, and termination. Commentators have also noted a lack of transparency and accuracy in the viewership metrics reported by platforms such as Facebook, pointing out that abrupt shifts in platforms' proprietary algorithms can have devastating effects on publishers' viewership, traffic, and revenue. Following a scandal in which Facebook revealed it had artificially inflated numbers to its advertisers about how long viewers watched ads, many journalists and industry analysts concluded that the shift to video was based on such misleading or inaccurate metrics, which created a false impression that there was customer demand for additional video content. History Streaming media technology has been available since the early 1990s, though it was relatively low- fidelity and not widely available until the mid-2000s. In 2007, legacy media publishers including the New York Times, Washington Post and Time Inc. created new divisions to develop web videos, and Facebook launched its video platform. Twitter purchased micro-video service Vine in October 2012, began adding native video streaming in late 2014, and acquired video-streaming service Periscope in January 2015. An August 2014 profile on Buzzfeed noted the publisher's large investment into video production, and observed that \\"the future of BuzzFeed may not even be on BuzzFeed.com. One of the company’s nascent ideas, BuzzFeed Distributed, will be a team of 20 people producing content that lives entirely on other popular platforms, like Tumblr, Instagram or Snapchat.\\" On 7 January 2015, Facebook issued a statement about \\"the shift to video,\\" reporting that \\"since June 2014, Facebook has averaged more than 1 billion video views every day.\\" Media critic John Herrman argued that \\"What the shift to Facebook video means is that Facebook is more interested in hosting the things media companies make than just spreading them, that it views links to outside pages as a problem to be solved, and that it sees Facebook-hosted video as an example of the solution.\\" In February 2015, the digital video-journalism publisher NowThis announced that it would operate without a home page, producing content to be published directly on social media platforms. In April 2016, Mashable fired much of its editorial staff, attempting to pivot away from hard news coverage while \\"growing Mashable across every platform\\" and doubling down on branded content and video. By December 2017, following a sale to Ziff Davis, Mashable retreated from this focus on video; Bernard Gershon, president of GershonMedia, said that the announcement of many such \\"pivots\\" were actually aimed primarily at investors. By 2017, \\"advertiser interest in video [was] insatiable... Any CFO is going to say 'How can we get more video?'\\" according to an executive of the publishers' trade association Digital Content Next. Publishers such as Vanity Fair, the Washington Post, and Sports Illustrated began adapting their own articles into cheap video content, either dictated by a newsreader or animated as a slideshow with captions, which could be shared on social platforms or even played alongside the articles themselves. June 2017 saw numerous high-profile pivots to video. Vocativ laid off at least 20 staff, including its entire newsroom, explaining that \\"as the industry evolves, we are undertaking a strategic shift to focus exclusively on video content that will be distributed via social media and other platforms.\\" Fox Sports eliminated its entire writing staff to focus on creating \\"premium video across all platforms.\\" And MTV News announced a restructuring that would cut its writing team. Less than two years earlier, MTV News had hired Grantland co-founder Dan Fierman to lead an significant investment in \\"longform\\" political and cultural reporting, but Fierman left in April 2017, and in June MTV announced it was \\"shifting resources into short-form video content more in line with young people's media consumption habits.\\" In July, Vice Media laid off at least 60 employees, including the editor-in-chief of Vice Sports, while expanding video production. August 2017 saw Mic cut ten writers and directed the remainder of the newsroom to generate videos for social platforms. CEO Chris Altchek said \\"When you think about how many hours people spend watching video versus reading, the audience has already spoken.\\" The move was ultimately unsuccessful, and Mic laid off the majority of its staff a year later. Movie Pilot CEO Tobi Bauckhage explained his company's fall 2017 layoffs as part of moving \\"from a text-based publishing model to video... a reaction to the fact that Facebook has changed their algorithms in favor of video instead of referral traffic over the last 12 months and we were losing money in the publishing bit of our business.\\" As part of the company's change in direction, the majority of its staff was laid off and its parent company was sold to Webedia. In November 2017, magazine publisher Condé Nast cut jobs, reduced the frequency of several magazines, and shut down the print edition of Teen Vogue, then invested significant new resources in video production, with a senior executive saying \\"In the next 24 months, I hope that video is half our business... It’s critical. It’s the macro trend of content consumption.\\" In February 2018, Vox Media cut approximately 50 employees, primarily those assigned to \\"social video,\\" as Vox CEO Jim Bankoff admitted that those efforts were not \\"viable audience or revenue growth drivers.\\" As euphemism Journalist Brian Feldman says that \\"'Pivoting to video' has become a business strategy for digital publishers common enough in recent months to be a kind of cliché — a slick way to describe something else: layoffs.\\" In response, writers use the phrase as gallows humor shorthand for death or cancellation, as in \\"how do i tell my bf i want our relationship to pivot to video\\" (SkyNews' Mollie Goodfellow) or \\"Horse broke its leg, so we had to take it out back and help it 'pivot to video'\\" (blogger Anil Dash). Facebook metrics controversy In September 2016, Facebook admitted that it had reported artificially inflated numbers to its advertisers about how long viewers watched ads leading to an overestimation of 60-80% Facebook apologized in an official statement and in multiple staff appearances at New York Advertising Week. Two months later, Facebook disclosed additional errors in audience metrics. In October 2018, a California federal court unsealed the text of a class action lawsuit filed by advertisers against Facebook, alleging that Facebook had known since 2015 that its viewership numbers were inflated \\"by some 150 to 900 percent\\" and waited over a year before taking action to disclose or fix the problem, citing internal Facebook communications that \\"somehow there was no progress on the task for the year\\" and decisions to \\"obfuscate the fact that we screwed up the math.\\" In response, some journalists and industry analysts complained that the industry-wide \\"pivot to video\\" was based on lies, though some publishers disagreed.

When Marge seems nervous, he gives her an over-the-top makeover. The party goes well, until Julio realizes that the guests have mistaken Marge for a drag queen. He later convinces Marge to just go with it, and introduces her to Springfield's drag scene.

Marge is furious, but when Homer shows up to the drag club dressed like a woman, she forgives him.

Plot Homer and Marge celebrate their anniversary, leaving the kids at home with Grampa. Marge points out that Grampa needs to be home in an hour, so she and Homer do all their activities as fast as possible. At home, Bart and Lisa are bored and ask Grampa if they can play a game. Bart finds some plastic army men toys in the basement, which causes Grampa to panic. The family takes him to the VA, but the doctor is unable to find out what's wrong. Lisa notices that the molding of the soldier toys resembles Grampa, then asks if the company that used him for the photos of the plastic army men paid him. Grampa recalls that in 1947 he was paid to model for the original army men, including a promise of a royalty for each toy. Grampa ends up on Channel 6 news and shortly after reaches national headlines on NBC. After the headlines, the toy company that used Grampa for their toys invites him to visit their headquarters in New York City. The chairman tells Grampa that he missed out on millions of dollars because he never signed his contract. Grampa remembers that he ran out of the shoot because the male photographer kissed him. The company then fired the photographer for being gay. Realizing that he may have ruined the photographer's life, Grampa makes his next goal to visit him to apologize. Lisa discovers that the photographer, Philip Hefflin, now lives in Marfa, Texas. The drive is long and the family encounters the Marfa lights and Prada Marfa. When they get to Philip's hometown, Grampa stumbles into a gallery filled with paintings of him in his army uniform. Philip greets Abe, stating that he was better off being true to himself. They enjoy time together before Abe has to head back to Springfield. In the backyard during the final scene, Bart, Milhouse, and Nelson are playing with the soldier toys.

It aired in the United States on Fox on March 3, 2019. Plot Homer and the children are eating at The Gilded Truffle, where they used a misprinted coupon good for 100% off. Meanwhile, with the saved money, Marge gets a Swedish massage. Outside the restaurant Homer warns the kids to not hustle to get ahead in life. The valet parking attendant Raphael hands Homer the keys to the wrong car, a fancy 1957 seafoam Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible. They drive away with it, having fun on the road. Back at Marge's massage, she senses Homer is doing something \\"incredibly stupid\\". When they go back to the restaurant, its owner Comic Book Guy threatens to have Homer arrested for grand theft auto of his father's car. When Comic Book Guy notices his mint condition copy of Radioactive Man #1 was damaged, he presses charges, and Homer is arrested. At Springfield County Court House, Judge Snyder finds Homer guilty, even after a touching apology letter written by Lisa. With two weeks before his sentencing hearing, the family prepares for the chance Homer might go to jail, and Marge agrees to make peace with Comic Book Guy. She goes to The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop to negotiate but Comic Book Guy says the issue is about getting respect. At home, Lisa discovers sentencing mitigations videos, including one employed by Mr. Burns, for one of his crimes against Springfield. The video, directed by Guillermo del Toro, opens with various monsters, then offers Burns as a sympathetic monster and product of a neglected and bullied childhood. They opt to use Springfield's last videographer, Gil, who Marge meets at Ol' Gil's Wedding Videos store, where she realizes they can do their own recording. Their efforts fall short but Lisa is able to splice together the work using her Final Cut Pro skills. In court Judge Snyder is initially open to setting Homer free but Comic Book Guy delivers an empassioned courtroom speech, the best Snyder has ever heard. He will deliver his verdict the next day. Lisa finds a replacement Radioactive Man #1 online in a nearby Ogdenville comic book shop. But at Comic Book Guy's store he still holds a grudge against Homer. However he notices Homer's 1975 season one Welcome Back, Kotter keychain, a \\"precious totem\\" to Homer, the only gift his father ever gave him. To make Homer feel how he felt with his beloved car and comic, Comic Book Guy smashes the keychain with Thor's hammer Mjölnir, then declares he'll drop the charges. He also declares Homer his best friend and that the two will go to Comic-Con. In the epilogue, Bart is shown in detention at school being supervised by Principal Skinner. Bart shows Skinner a prank sentencing mitigation video with Milhouse extolling Bart's transformative help, while the video plays Bart escapes from the room. Reception \\"101 Mitigations\\" scored a 0.8 rating with a 4 share and was watched by 2.25 million people, making The Simpsons Fox's highest rated show of the night. Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, stating \\"What did we learn from this episode? Certainly not the intended lesson that moments of pure joy always have consequences, it is German is earth's closest language to Klingon. The episode is funny and revelatory, though not always tummy rumbling funny. '101 Mitigations' contains a good mix of the clever and the silly, with a moral compass set on cruise control.\\" Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, stating \\"For Homer to finally understand the pain his wacky weekly nonsense causes to another person could be a loaded moment, dramatically. But the episode fudges it. The brisk running time—truncated more by del Toro's time-consuming but attention- grabbing cameo—leaves Homer and CBG's rapprochement hanging unsatisfactorily, pawned off on the joke that Homer regards CBG's invitation to Comic-Con as barely preferable to prison. The Simpsons has room for its characters' signature misbehaviors to be deconstructed in a meaningful way. It's a shame '101 Mitigations' doesn't.

Bart is playing a game called 'Conflict of Enemies' with Milhouse, Sophie, Nelson and Martin. At Marge's insistence, Homer attempts to get Bart to play less, but when he realizes they're playing for a $1,000 prize, he relents. The team wins and qualifies for a $500,000 tournament. Homer begins coaching the team. While sleeping he visits the club of dads that lived vicariously through their glorious athletic children, including Earl Woods, father of Tiger Woods. The team qualifies for the World Championship in Seoul, South Korea. Back at home, Lisa wants to go to the Jogyesa Temple in South Korea, and sees the world championship as an opportunity to fulfill her desire, so Marge agrees to take her too. In Seoul, Homer swaps Milhouse for another player. Lisa then takes the family to the monastery, achieving Zen.

It aired in the United States on Fox on March 24, 2019. Plot The Simpsons attend a convention where Krusty the Clown hosts a panel discussion about his show. After expressing frustration at fans who ask repetitive questions, he announces that \\"Itchy & Scratchy\\" will be rebooted with the characters re-cast as females. While Lisa is excited by the changes, Bart, Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin all express outrage and swear that they will never watch the show again in protest. Bart hosts a party where the boys make a point of not watching the show. However, he overhears Lisa recording a reaction video onto her phone as she watches the episode and decides to investigate. He laughs despite himself and is confronted by Lisa. When he lies to his friends about watching the episode, Lisa, having recorded his laugh, uploads the video online from her phone in revenge. Lisa's video goes viral and Bart is confronted by his friends at school, who rebuke him for betraying his gender. They try to beat him up, but he takes shelter in the girls' bathroom where he meets Carmen, Erica and Piper; three sixth-grade girls. The girls call themselves \\"Bossy Riot\\" (a play on Pussy Riot) and carry out pranks in the name of feminism. Bart reveals himself to be El Barto and persuades them to let him join Bossy Riot by improving one of their pranks. In Bart's absence, the boys turn to Milhouse as their new leader. He forms the \\"Boys' Rights Association\\", or BRA, and they begin pressuring Krusty into reverting the changes to Itchy & Scratchy. Bart and Bossy Riot carry out a series of pranks aimed at male authority figures around Springfield, with the girls giving him a purple mask allowing him to partake in the pranks with them undetected. The townspeople are afraid and their antics make the evening news. Lisa realizes that Bart is part of Bossy Riot when she sees a loose purple yarn string from his shorts and confronts him in his room. He initially denies it but immediately admits it when she says it destroys her vision of the entire universe. She accuses him of hiding behind causes he does not believe in to carry out pranks; Bart counters that while Lisa advocates causes, she has never had the courage to take action. At Bossy Riot's meeting, they learn that Krusty has relented to BRA and will restore the male version of Itchy & Scratchy. In retaliation, Carmen, Erica and Piper plan to destroy the \\"Itchy & Scratchy\\" master tapes on live television, destroying \\"Itchy & Scratchy\\" forever. Bart protests their actions; causing the three girls to retaliate by tying him up and escaping before Lisa finds him. Bart and Lisa make their way to Krusty's studios where the girls are about to drop the tapes into a vat of nail polish remover. As Bart unsuccessfully tries to reason with them through mansplaining, Lisa decides to take action, knocking the vat away at the last moment. The nail polish remover floods the studio floor and the fumes overwhelm the assembled members of BRA, causing them to break into tears. Lisa's actions are caught on camera, impressing Bossy Riot while BRA blame Milhouse for their humiliation after having their tears glycerized by the girls. As Bart says farewell to the girls, Lisa is inspired to take further action and joins Bossy Riot, while Bart agrees not to fight for causes he does not believe in. He gives Lisa his purple mask and as he watches Lisa and the girls ride away, he spray-paints a message on a wall that reads \\"The patriarchy is a weiner\\", implying that his time with Bossy Riot offered him more than a chance to cause mischief. During the credits, Bart makes peace with his friends. They ask him about his time with the girls and much to their distress, he reveals that \\"they do not envy us\\".

Reception \\"Bart vs. Itchy & Scratchy\\" scored a 0.8 rating with a 4 share and was watched by 1.99 million people. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B stating, \\"And if Bossy Riot's prankish crime spree (‘Eve was framed’ reads the doctored sign at the First Church Of Springfield) is depicted here as the half-formed eruption of the very real resentment engendered by the girls’ cultural awakening, ‘Bart Vs. Itchy & Scratchy’ bestows its ultimate approval in the quietly rousing finale. Lisa, despite rejecting Bossy Riot's rash plot to destroy the (unbacked-up) Itchy & Scratchy master tapes, makes the decision to don Bart's knit cap and pedal off with the big girls on their own wobbling but righteous crusade. (Lisa's genuinely trepidatious inner doubts about ‘pushing my beliefs further than they've ever gone’ before hopping on her bike is just the Lisa-Amram moment I was hoping for.) And Bart, weaned from his newfound comradeship by the revelation that he was ‘just kept around for fingerprints and DNA,’ yet whips out his pink spray paint and scrawls ‘The patriarchy is a wiener’ on a nearby wall. As Lisa correctly surmised, Bart was acting merely as a ‘mercenary in someone else's war,’ but the episode finds a lovely, hopeful, and sweetly subversive way to show that both Bart and Lisa learned something important, even in a trifling pop cultural stunt.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4 out of 5 points stating, \\"The Simpsons 'Bart vs. Itchy & Scratchy' is a formidable and forward thinking entry for the season. This season has consistently rewarded what might be universally accepted bad behavior. Tonight's main activity is vandalism. Bart doesn't admit being in Bossy Riot to his sister because she would in any way be happy or admire him for it. He does because she says knowing her brother is doing something she respects would destroy her entire vision of the universe. The episode skewers expectations. Every turn happens because of something somehow taboo, like laughing inappropriately, or admitting to the boys' club that girls don't envy them.\\" References External links * The Simpsons (season 30) episodes 2019 American television episodes LGBT-related animation ","title":"Bart vs. Itchy &amp; Scratchy"},{"id":"58807051","text":"\\"Girl's in the Band\\" is the 19th episode of the thirtieth season of the American animated sitcom, The Simpsons, and the 658th episode overall. It aired in the United States on Fox on March 31, 2019. It's also the first episode written by Nancy Cartwright, voice actor of Bart Simpson among others, making her the third of six main cast members to have an episode to their name. Many scripts since season 11 having been cowritten by Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer Simpson among others, and Harry Shearer, voice of many main supporting characters, writing the season 28 episode \\"Trust But Clarify\\".

Simmons makes his fifth guest appearance in the series as Victor Kleskow in homage to his abusive instructor role in the 2014 film Whiplash. Plot Springfield Elementary School's music teacher and band director Dewey Largo wakes up from a nightmare next to his unnamed gay partner and recalls how even though he graduated top of his class, his once-promising musical conductor career failed and led him to teach elementary music where he is now unhappy. At Springfield Elementary School, Largo is conducting the school orchestra when he receives an email from Victor Kleskow, the musical director of the Capital City Philharmonic, saying he will be attending the concert the next night. Largo, newly inspired to impress Kleskow, starts training the students with \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\\" The next night the concert is a success, with the children playing \\"Troika\\" from Lieutenant Kije, but Largo is sad when instead of poaching him, Kleskow chooses to take Lisa Simpson for his youth orchestra. Homer and Marge Simpson struggle to find a way to schedule and pay for Lisa's new extracurricular school work. Once they arrive at Capital City, Lisa finds it difficult to work with Kleskow, as he reveals his true menacing personality, and how just one mistake can make him angry. To earn extra money Homer starts working the night shift to pay for Lisa's participation in the orchestra. Meanwhile, at the new orchestra's campus, Bart is confined in a closet with the siblings of the other student musicians. Lisa wins the first chair for saxophone in a competition by out- performing another student, but she realizes how selfish she has become, and how she has failed to realize the toll of her new music lessons and associated travel times are taking on her family. Kleskow offers to advance Lisa to the next class, which costs more and is farther away. Meanwhile, Homer is seemingly sleep-deprived and starts hallucinating during his shift at the nuclear power plant: dancing and drinking with the bartender Lloyd from The Shining. To avoid more problems for her and her family, Lisa, in trying out for the upper-level orchestra, instead fails on purpose, destroying her saxophone career. Reception Dennis Perkins from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- stating, \\"Working through a conflict on The Simpsons is a lot harder than it looks. We have to start at one and return to one, all in 20-odd minutes, and all in a world that can never fundamentally change. So the conflict here means Lisa and her family each have to come to terms with a seemingly insoluble problem, all while staying true to each character, and not short-changing anyone in the necessary resolution. It’s harder, I maintain, on a show like this than on a more conventionally serialized show, where arcs can affect the whole in a more permanent way going forward. Still, a great episode of The Simpsons finds a way to do that... 'Girl’s In The Band' isn’t a bad effort at finding that narrative and the comedic sweet spot that made The Simpsons, The Simpsons—but it’s an incomplete and unsatisfying one.\\" \\"Girl's in the Band\\" scored a 0.8 rating with a 4 share and was watched by 2.07 million people.

The musical mock salute to upstate New York drew substantial attention from the natives of that area, including a response from the New York State Republican Committee blaming the policies of Andrew Cuomo for making the region a laughingstock and a fact check from the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, which concluded most of the claims were true but that some (such as Fox News viewership and disability claims) were misleading or unprovable. The Great New York State Fair responded that they were taking the song in jest but would invite the writers to the fair to allow them to see the area in person. The episode came under fire in late April 2019 for offending some people. While the episode mocked American and Canadian heads of state Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau and brought up the SNC-Lavalin affair, the aspects that caused offense were largely related to the Frank Sinatra parody song where Homer made fun of Upstate New York and for the use of the slur \\"newfie\\" in relation to Canadian residents of Newfoundland. In the latter several Canadian children chime \\"stupid newfies\\" before a character closely resembling Ralph Wiggum calls himself one and proceeds to beat a baby seal pup plush toy with a club while singing about being a Newfoundlander.

Because the town's approval of corporate tax cuts prevents anyone from getting government health care, Bart is forced to switch to a generic medicine for his attention deficit disorder, which results in odd side effects.

EGS was established to develop and operate the systems and facilities necessary to process and launch rockets and spacecraft during assembly, transport and launch. EGS is preparing the infrastructure to support NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and its payloads, such as the Orion spacecraft for Artemis 1. Artemis 1 is the first in a series of increasingly complex missions that will enable human exploration to the Moon and Mars.  EGS assets  EGS holds and operates the following assets: * Vehicle Assembly Building * Launch Control Center, Firing Room 1 * Crawler-transporter * ML-1 and ML-2 * Launch Pad 39B  History  EGS was originally entitled the Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) Program. It has its roots in the Constellation program (2005-2010), but only took control of assets and commenced operations under SLS (from 2010). For example, after the final launch of the Space Shuttle, GSDO took responsibility for LC-39A.https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/632684main_NASA_FY13_Budget_Space-Ops-508.pdf However, there were no plans to use this pad, and basic maintenance was costing millions per year. In 2013, NASA signed a long-term lease of LC-39A to SpaceX. Blue Origin filed a protest to the Government Accountability Office that the pad should not be made exclusive, and should be operated by a tenant that would sublease to multiple different users and rockets to take advantage of. However, the GAO rejected this petition and allowed the lease to SpaceX, as there was no stated preference by NASA for or against a multiuser approach.https://spacenews.com/38641gao-denies-blue-origins-bid-protest-of- pad-39a-lease/ EGS was intended in general to \\"support several different kinds of spacecraft and rockets that are in development ... unlike previous work focusing on a single kind of launch vehicle, such as the Saturn V or Space Shuttle ... EGS's mission is to transform the center from a historically government-only launch complex to a spaceport that can handle several different kinds of spacecraft and rockets—both government and commercial.\\". The other LC-39 pad, LC-39B, specifically was intended to support multiple users. However, as time went on, the alternate launch vehicles that were to use LC-39B were all eventually removed from the plan or canceled entirely, such as Liberty and OmegA. OmegA was the final removal, with its cancellation and planned demolition of its launch tower in September 2020. This leaves EGS solely focused on supporting the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft, meaning LC-39B will enjoy at most one launch per year under current launch manifests.https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/09/omega-mlp-ksc-39b-multi- user-pad/ In the end, LC-39A is leased exclusively to SpaceX, and LC-39B will be used exclusively by SLS for the foreseeable future. Charlie Blackwell- Thompson serves as launch director for NASA's Exploration Ground Systems Program. She will oversee the countdown and liftoff of NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. Named to the position in January 2016, Blackwell-Thompson is NASA's first female launch director.  Launch Platforms  ML-1 Structure, Umbilicals, and Accessories Comparison Between ML-1 and ML-2 Concepts One of the primary activities of EGS has been to prepare all infrastructure needed to launch SLS. SLS will use a mobile launcher platform, which is a launch structure that moves out with the rocket to the launch pad (LC-39B), carried atop a Crawler Transporter. ML-1 for SLS block 1 Under the Constellation program, a new platform was constructed, called Mobile Launcher-1 (ML-1), for the Ares I. This initial construction was completed in August 2010, at a cost of $234 million.https://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY12/IG-12-022.pdf After the cancellation of Constellation and the beginning of SLS, NASA decided to modify ML-1 for SLS. In August 2011, it was estimated that modifying ML-1 would cost $54M, modifying the old Space Shuttle launch platform would cost $93M, and building a brand new platform would cost $122M. However, in March 2020, a report from the NASA Inspector General came out, stating that ML-1 is running 3 years behind schedule and had cost $927M in total ($234M for the initial construction for Ares, and $693M for adapting it for SLS).https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/nasa-spent-a-decade-and- nearly-1-billion-for-a-single-launch- tower/https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-20-013.pdf The program manager of EGS stated in January 2020 that: \\"The EGS team has finished mobile launcher testing at the launch pad and will finish testing at the VAB in January. At that point, all of the launch infrastructure will be tested and ready for operations.\\" https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/NASA_rings_in_busy_new_year_in_Florida_to_prepare_for_Artemis_Missions_999.html ML-1 is only tall enough to be used for Block 1 of the SLS, so the current manifest calls for it to be used for four missions: Artemis 1 through 3, and Europa Clipper, with the first launch scheduled for November 2021. ML-2 for SLS block 1B In October 2017, it was decided that modifying ML-1 again for the even larger SLS Block 1B was undesirable, as it would induce a 33 month delay between SLS launches to undertake the needed modifications. Congress funded $350M in 2018 for construction of ML-2, and in 2019 NASA awarded a $383M 44-month contract, with completion scheduled for March 2023. ML-2 is expected to run into fewer challenges than ML-1, the Inspector General report states, as NASA is \\"taking steps to incorporate lessons learned\\" from ML-1. For example, as suggested by a June 2019 Government Accountability Office report,https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/699923.pdf NASA concurred that 3D modeling software shall be used \\"to better integrate components, manage requirement changes, and provide up-to-date designs for all stakeholders\\". The GAO report stated: \\"The improved design processes the EGS program is pursuing in the development of the second Mobile Launcher, including the development of a 3D model to facilitate integrated design, have the potential to improve program outcomes. Further, achieving design stability before beginning construction would also improve this potential.\\" Milestones August 31, 2018 – The Mobile Launcher Platform (MLP) arrives at Launch Pad 39B. The ML underwent a fit check, followed by several days of systems testing. September 8, 2018 – The MLP, atop Crawler-transporter 2, moves into the VAB for the first time. October 17, 2018 – The first high speed retract test was completed on the Orion Service Module Umbilical (OSMU) on the MLP. The test verified umbilical arm alignment, rotation speed, and latch back systems. The OSMU will transfer power, data, and coolant for the electronics, and purge air for the environmental controls to the Orion service module and Launch Abort System. October 30 – November 6, 2018 – Underway Recovery Test-7 (URT-7) was conducted in the Pacific Ocean. URT-7 is one in a series of tests that the Exploration Ground Systems Recovery Team, along with the U.S. Navy, are conducting to verify and validate procedures and hardware that will be used to recover the Orion spacecraft after it lands in the Pacific Ocean following deep space exploration missions. November 19, 2018 – The Crew/Service Module Mock-up and Orion Transportation Pallet (OTP) were successfully moved to the Servicing Stand, as part of the Handling and Access (H&A;) subsystem Verification and Validation testing at the Multi-Payload Processing Facility (MPPF). This testing allowed the Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) team to verify access to several servicing panels on the Orion vehicle, which will be needed to prepare Orion for Artemis 1. December 14, 2018 – Successful countdown demonstration completed, intended to validate the launch team's capability to perform an Artemis 1 countdown and respond to challenges put into the system for practice. April 15, 2019 – Exploration Ground Systems' launch team completed their first formal training simulation that will certify the team for the inaugural launch of the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft. The team, led by Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, performed a countdown simulation of loading the SLS with liquid oxygen and hydrogen — complete with surprise issues the team had to work real-time. July 25, 2019 – A flow test of the Ignition Overpressure Protection and Sound Suppression water deluge system was conducted on the mobile launcher at Launch Pad 39B. Modifications were made to the pad after a previous wet flow test, increasing the performance of the system.

Part of the Gold Coast of Connecticut, 2017 The Gold Coast, also known as Lower Fairfield County or Southwestern Connecticut not limited to the Connecticut panhandle, is an affluent part of Western Connecticut that includes the entire southern portion of Fairfield County as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, Super-Public Use Microdata Area (Super-PUMA) Region 09600. The area is about 50 miles northeast of New York City, and is home to many wealthy Manhattan business executives. Parts of the region are served by the Western Connecticut Council of Governments. This area is often portrayed in culture as a bastion of wealth. Since the mid-20th century, a number of novels and films have been set here, including Gentleman's Agreement, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, The Swimmer, The Stepford Wives, and The Ice Storm. The Showtime drama series Billions highlights the area's prominence as a haven for hedge funds and other financial services firms. The Gold Coast generally includes landlocked towns like New Canaan, Wilton, and Weston as well, with the scenic Merritt Parkway as its centerpiece.

Other areas in Fairfield County that are regarded for their wealth and expensive lakefront property are Brookfield, New Fairfield, Danbury and Sherman. These towns are located along Candlewood Lake, and are also located in close proximity to the City. Brookfield and Newtown are located along the shores of Lake Lillinonah, which also consists of expensive waterfront property. Although the term \\"Gold Coast\\" could apply to any of the thirteen parkway municipalities, the distinction of being called \\"the wealthiest town in Connecticut\\" can be attributed to the panhandle: either Darien, Greenwich or New Canaan, depending on the statistic used. With waterfront generally having the highest property value and coveted direct access to the New Haven railroad commuter line and Interstate 95, Darien and Greenwich boast a lower mill rate and are generally more sought after than New Canaan. However, property value is not the only way to determine which is wealthier. As a side note, Darien has been listed as the richest town in the US as of 2018. It is difficult to compare the three, as each has markedly different land area. In addition, Greenwich has three times the population of Darien or New Canaan. With more land area, average home values in New Canaan may be higher than Darien, but not the price per square foot. With a higher population, a larger demographic weighs greater on the median income in Greenwich. This plus the 47 square miles in land area makes Greenwich essentially incomparable. New Canaan has an advantage of having more than 50% greater land area than Darien, but with a similar-sized population. According to the 2000 US Census, New Canaan was first in per capita income ($82,049), Darien second ($77,519) and Greenwich third ($74,346). According to the Connecticut 2014-15 Adjusted Equalized Net Grand List per Capita (AENGLC); Per Capita Income for Greenwich was $91,478, Darien $94,376, and New Canaan $99,016: the highest of the 169 towns in Connecticut. Per capita income does not take into account personal assets, such as homes, jewelry, art, boats or automobiles, so many of these families have much greater net worth. Greenwich has the lowest mill rate, which may indicate higher property value, with Darien ranking second. In 2000, New Canaan had a higher percentage of resident homeowners (83%) than Greenwich (69%), which may indicate more wealth. According to some sources, New Canaan should be considered the wealthiest town along the Gold Coast because of its higher rate of home ownership, suggesting a higher level of personal assets.How Census Income Estimates Provide Misleading Statistics on Personal Income for Connecticut Towns In July 2011, The Daily Fairfield reported that Darien was the state's richest town.\\"Darien Rises to the Top of the State\\", The Daily Fairfield; retrieved 2011-07-03 An additional consideration is to measure wealth per person - not aggregate town wealth. Both the Adjusted Equalized Net Grand List per Capita (AENGLC) Wealth Value and the CPR AENGLC Wealth Value, show that Greenwich has the highest wealth value in Connecticut, at more than $430,000 per person. The AENGLC is based on the value of residential and commercial real estate, and measures the town's tax base available to pay for public education (see Conn. Dep of Ed). It is not a measure of the personal wealth of individual residents. Yet another definition for the Gold coast is one provided by the University of Connecticut's \\"Five Connecticuts\\" study, which indicates that the area includes the \\"wealthy,\\" or blue towns. These are Greenwich, Darien, New Canaan, Westport, Weston, Wilton, Ridgefield, Redding, Brookfield, New Fairfield and Easton. A last method is to check the planning regions. This yields very similar results to the above method but adds Stamford and Norwalk, while subtracting Ridgefield. A 2015 Connecticut Post article ranked Darien as the snobbiest town in Connecticut.

He is on death row in the state of Arizona. In 2012, Strong was convicted of murdering Doctor Satinder Gill in the city of Yuma, Arizona, a crime which took place in 2007. Strong was sentenced to life in prison for that crime. While serving this sentence, Strong was also tried and convicted of the 2005 murder of a family of six, including four young children, in a crime that came to be known as the La Mesa Street Murders. Strong was sentenced to death in that case. Early life and criminal record Little is known about Strong's childhood and early life, aside from the fact that he was born in June 1966. As an adult, Strong worked at a Yuma area car dealership, but police have also referred to him as a \\"career con man.\\" Aside from the Gill and La Mesa Murders, Strong has several convictions in the state of Arizona for theft and forgery among other crimes. La Mesa Street murders On June 24, 2005 Yuma Police Department officers were called to a house at 2037 La Mesa Street for a report that shots had been fired and someone was screaming for help. When police arrived they discovered 35-year-old Luis Rios in the back yard of the house, still alive but riddled with gunshot wounds. Rios died later at Yuma Regional Medical Center from his injuries. Not knowing what the situation in the house was, but knowing Rios and his girlfriend had children in the home, police surrounded the house and treated the scene as a potential stand-off or hostage situation, but once police entered the house they discovered five more bodies. A now retired police officer who was one of the first to enter the home told the local paper that the home was dark when they entered through a side door, but they immediately came upon two bodies, lying on the floor. These were the bodies of 13-year-old Andreas Crawford, and 12-year-old Enrique Bedoya who both died of asphyxiation. Later, police also discovered 29-year-old Adrienne Heredia (the girlfriend of Rios), and 9-year-old Inez Newman who were both dead from asphyxiation and 6-year-old Danny Heredia III who was dead from multiple gunshot wounds. In the months and years following the crime, police received thousands of calls, anonymous tips and conducted over 1,300 interviews, but it was not until November 28, 2007 that police announced that Preston Strong was a suspect in the murders. At the time of this announcement, Strong was already in police custody for unrelated fraud charges. In the summer of 2014 Strong was officially charged with six counts of first degree murder in connection to the deaths. On April 25, 2017 Strong was found guilty on six first degree murder counts and later sentenced to death. According to prosecutors in the case, Strong murdered the family because Rios, who at one time had been a close friend of Strong's, had stopped \\"giving Strong handouts.\\" The case garnered national media attention, being covered publications such as People Magazine. Surviving members of Adrienne Heredia's family even appeared on a 2006 episode of The Montel Williams Show, hoping psychic medium and author Sylvia Browne could provide them with answers to the case.  Murder of Dr. Satinder Gill  On November 2, 2007, the body of 62-year-old Dr. Satinder Gil was discovered inside his home with his head in a bath tub filled with water. He. had been suffocated, and showed signs of blunt force trauma. Some $24,000 in cash, which a friend had delivered to Dr. Gil the day before the death, was also missing from the home. A friend of Dr. Gill's testified at trial that on the day before the body was found, the doctor had called her, and offered to pay her $100 to go to his house and pick up and cash a $24,000 check. The friend said the doctor was acting very strangely, and that when she delivered the cash (all in $50 bills) later in the day the doctor did not fully open the door. Instead he only opened the door part-way, just enough to receive the money. The woman also testified that she had agreed to meet the doctor later that same night for dinner, but he never showed up. When a stranger called her from Dr. Gill's phone the next day, claiming to have found it by a canal, the friend panicked and called police to perform a welfare check. When no one answered the door at the doctor's home, firefighters eventually broke in, finding the house filled with natural gas and lit candles. Surveillance video from a local Walmart store taken on November 1 showed Strong attempting to buy a $4,300 money order. The cashier told police she asked Strong for an identification and he claimed did not have any. The cashier also said that because Strong had no I.D. he opted to buy four smaller money orders, in amounts that did not require proof of identity. Strong's girlfriend at the time also testified in court that she had become suspicious of Strong when he gave her $9,500 in cash on the day the doctor's body was found. The girlfriend felt this was suspicious as she had been paying most of the couple's expenses and she did not know where he could have acquired so much cash overnight. The same day the doctor's body was found, Strong was taken into custody on unrelated fraud charges, and on November 28, 2007 police announced Strong was a suspect in both the Gill and La Mesa cases. While awaiting trial for the Gill murder, Strong was sentenced to 3.5 years in jail on an unrelated theft charge. Sentencing and aftermath In 2012 Strong was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the murder of Dr. Santinder Gill. He received an additional 25.5 years in prison for kidnapping, armed robbery. burglary, aggravated assault and attempted arson, all relating to the Gill case. Two years later, while serving that sentence, he was re-arrested and tried for six counts of first degree murder in the La Mesa case. He was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to death. Since the La Mesa case wrapped, Strong has continued to appeal both convictions, telling a journalist with The Arizona Republic he believed the police were guilty of criminal misconduct in his case.

Venice had enjoyed a privileged position in the Constantinople-based Latin Empire, and Palaiologos had allied with Venice's main commercial rival, the Republic of Genoa, against them. The loss of Constantinople to Palaiologos was a heavy blow to Venice's political and commercial position in the East, as it cut off access to the Black Sea, and gave the Genoese privileged access instead. A naval war against Genoa and Byzantium followed, but despite a significant Venetian victory at the Battle of Settepozzi in 1263, it failed to produce decisive results. Nevertheless, Palaiologos became dissatisfied with the Genoese military performance, and the two allies grew increasingly mistrustful towards each other, leading the Byzantine emperor to seek a rapprochement with Venice. A first treaty was concluded in 1265 but not ratified by Venice. Finally, the rise of Charles of Anjou in Italy and his hegemonic ambitions in the wider region, which threatened both Venice and the Byzantines, provided additional incentive for both powers to seek an accommodation. A new treaty was concluded in April 1268, with terms and wording more favourable to the Byzantines. It provided for a mutual truce of five years, the release of prisoners, and readmitted and regulated the presence of Venetian merchants in the Empire. Many of the trading privileges they had previously enjoyed were restored, but on considerably less advantageous terms to Venice than what Palaiologos had been willing to concede in 1265. The Byzantines were forced to recognize the Venetian possession of Crete and other areas captured after the Fourth Crusade, but succeeded in avoiding a full rupture with Genoa, while removing for a time the threat of a Venetian fleet assisting Charles of Anjou in his plans to capture Constantinople. Background In the aftermath of the Sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the Republic of Venice, which had provided the Crusaders with their fleet, received many of the spoils of the fallen Byzantine Empire: three-eighths of the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, and numerous strategically positioned colonies, including Crete. This event opened the Black Sea to Venetian trade, while Venetian influence in Constantinople ensured that throughout the newly established Latin Empire, the Venetians gained a privileged position, which secured their ascendancy over their old commercial rivals, the fellow Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa. Byzantine–Genoese–Venetian relations after 1261 Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (14th-century miniature from George Pachymeres' History). The recovery of Constantinople by the Nicaean emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261, and the re-establishment of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty, was a major blow to the position and interests of Venice. Furthermore, to counter the mighty Venetian fleet, Palaiologos had allied with the Genoese in the Treaty of Nymphaeum, and the Genoese were at war with Venice. This agreement not only gave the Genoese great privileges, but also assigned them the former quarters and property of the Venetians in Constantinople and threatened to exclude the Venetians from the Black Sea trade. Initially, the Venetians supported the exiled Latin Emperor, Baldwin II, in his efforts to form a new Crusade and reclaim his throne, and Venetian diplomacy henceforth \\"served to bind together Latin projects to retake the capital\\", in the words of Deno Geanakoplos. Barred from the Black Sea and Constantinople by her rival, Venice now followed a two- pronged strategy of using the Papacy and the threat of excommunication to pry the Genoese away from the Byzantines, and of obtaining the assistance of other Western powers, like Manfred of Sicily, for a campaign against Palaiologos. In the meantime, Venetian naval activity in the Aegean Sea did not provide any concrete results. In the summer of 1262, the Venetians ordered a 37-galley fleet into the Aegean, which met the Genoese fleet of 60 ships at Thessalonica, but the Genoese refused to engage. A piratical foray by the nobles of Negroponte, allied with Venice, into the Marmara Sea was confronted and defeated by a Byzantine–Genoese squadron. In 1263, however, the Battle of Settepozzi ended in a clear Venetian victory, and much diminished the value of the Genoese alliance in the eyes of Palaiologos, who was furthermore annoyed by the Genoese captains' preference for attacking Venetian shipping for booty rather than assisting in supplying his forces fighting in the Morea, and concerned at the growth of Genoese influence in his own capital, as they threatened to acquire even more of a stranglehold on commerce than the Venetians had ever possessed. Soon after the battle Michael VIII dismissed sixty Genoese ships from his service. Both sides became increasingly mistrustful of each other, and Michael began to delay the payments for the crews of the Genoese ships. The Byzantine–Genoese rift widened further in 1264, when the Genoese podestà in Constantinople was implicated in a plot to surrender the city to Manfred of Sicily, whereupon the emperor expelled the Genoese from the city to Heraclea Perinthus. Unratified treaty of 1265 Palaiologos then sent a Venetian prisoner of war, Arrigo Trevisano, as his envoy to Venice. Doge Reniero Zeno sent Trevisano back to Constantinople, along with Benedetto Grillone, who in turn were replaced by Jacopo Dolfin and Jacopo Contarini. On 18 June 1265, a first treaty of truce was signed by Palaiologos and the Venetian envoys in Constantinople. Its terms were highly advantageous to the Venetians, and would, in the opinion of Geanakoplos, almost restore to her the position she had enjoyed before 1261. The Greek and Latin texts of the treaty are preserved in the collection of Venetian diplomatic documents compiled by Gottlieb Tafel and Georg Thomas and published by the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna. Its main provisions were: # The cession to Venice of designated quarters for her colonists in Constantinople, Thessalonica, and other Byzantine cities, with the recognition of a Venetian bailo as the chief Venetian official in the Empire # Venetian merchants were exempted from all taxes in the Empire # The Genoese were to be entirely expelled from the Empire, and any future Byzantine treaties with Genoa would require the consent of Venice # Venice would remain at peace with the Byzantines even if a friendly power—the Papacy, France, Sicily, Castile, Aragon, England, Charles of Anjou, Pisa, and Ancona were explicitly mentioned—should attack Constantinople # If the Genoese should attack Constantinople, Venice would come to the aid of the city with a fleet of equal size to that of Genoa # Venetian possession of Crete, and the two outposts of Modon and Coron on the Morea were recognized by Palaiologos # Palaiologos received a free hand against the Latin lords of Negroponte, while the Venetian citizens there were prohibited from aiding them, in exchange for a guarantee of their own properties and position on the island # The other Latin territories in the Aegean captured after the Fourth Crusade, including the feudatories of the Principality of Achaea, were to be returned to Palaiologos The treaty was not ratified by the Doge for unclear reasons: according to Geanakoplos, either the Venetians interpreted Palaiologos' concessions as a sign of weakness, or mistrusted his ultimate intentions, since his desire to restore the Byzantine Empire to its pre-1204 boundaries was obvious and directly affected their own possessions in the area. Furthermore, as Donald Nicol points out, Zeno still cherished the title, conferred in 1204, of \\"Lord of one-quarter and one-eighth of the Empire of Romania\\" (dominus quartae partis et dimidiae totius Imperii Romaniae), and would be loath to accept a treaty that recognized him merely as \\"Doge of Venice and Lord of Croatia, Dalmatia, and the other places and islands subject to his authority\\" (, ) and that effectively diminished his standing and reverted the relations between Venice and Constantinople to the status quo before 1204. Venice may have hoped to secure, or even augment, her position in the area with the aid of either Manfred of Sicily or the new and ambitious contender for supremacy in Italy, Charles of Anjou, whose ultimate designs on Constantinople were common knowledge—hence his inclusion in the draft treaty by Palaiologos. Rise of Charles of Anjou Coronation of Charles of Anjou as King of Sicily (14th- century miniature). His imperial ambitions forced Palaiologos to seek an accommodation with Venice. Following his decisive victory over Manfred at the Battle of Benevento in February 1266, Charles of Anjou, now master of Italy, began to plan for the realization of his ambitions against Constantinople. His plans were made public with the Treaty of Viterbo in May 1267, concluded between Charles, the exiled Latin Emperor Baldwin, the Papacy, and the Principality of Achaea. Charles pledged to assist Baldwin in recovering his capital and territories that had once belonged to the Latin Empire, in exchange for several territorial concessions in the Aegean and the western Balkans, and the suzerainty over Achaea. In an effort to lure the cautious Venetians into the pact, they were promised the full restoration of the rights they had enjoyed after 1204. Concerned over Charles' ambitions, and with his previous treaty with Venice null and void, Palaiologos turned again to Genoa, allowing the establishment of a Genoese colony in the suburb of Galata, across the Golden Horn from Constantinople. These developments disquietened the Venetians as well: their trade with the East had suffered considerably following the Byzantine alliance with Genoa, while Charles of Anjou's imperial ambitions in the Adriatic and Greece were a potential threat to Venice's own freedom of access to the Mediterranean. Consequently, on 1 November 1267, Doge Reniero Zeno sent two plenipotentiary ambassadors, Marco Bembo and Pietro Zeno, to negotiate a treaty with Palaiologos. Treaty of 1268 The Byzantine–Venetian treaty was concluded on 4 April 1268 at Constantinople. Palaiologos' position vis-à-vis Venice had improved in the years since 1265. As a result, the terms of the new treaty were considerably less advantageous to the Venetians, who furthermore felt compelled to recognize Palaiologos with the title imperator et moderator Romanorum (\\"emperor and governor of the Romans\\"), rather than Graecorum (\\"of the Greeks\\") as in 1265, and with the flattering appellation \\"the new Constantine\\", which Palaiologos had adopted after recovering Constantinople. The treaty was ratified by Doge Zeno on 30 June, but he died a few days later. Palaiologos quickly sent ambassadors to Venice, George Tzimiskes and George Kalodoukas, who were able to secure its recognition by Zeno's successor, Lorenzo Tiepolo, on 30 July. Terms The Latin text of the treaty is published in the collection of Venetian documents by Tafel and Thomas. The terms of the treaty were: # A truce of five-year duration, on both land and sea, beginning from 4 April 1268, between the Republic of Venice and the \\"Empire of Romania\\". Venice pledged not to attack Byzantium or any territory subject to it, nor to ally with any power against it—a clear reference to Charles of Anjou—nor to allow any Venetian ships captains or nobles to engage with \\"other kings, princes, barons or counts\\" in designs against Byzantine territories, nor would Venice allow Venetian ships to be used to carry troops against the Emperor's territories. # All Greek prisoners held at Crete, Modon and Coron, Negroponte, or other places, would be released immediately, and be free to either stay in the same locations or depart to wherever they wished. Palaiologos promised to do the same with any Venetians incarcerated in Byzantine territory, and prohibit the manufacture and sale of weapons for use against the Venetians. # Likewise the Emperor pledged \\"on the True and Venerable Cross according to the customs of the Greeks and the Holy Gospels of God\\" to observe the same terms, to ensure that no harm would befall the Venetians on Crete or any other of their possessions, and to remove any of his men from Crete (where Byzantine troops had been sent in support of the revolt of the Chortatzes brothers). Likewise Palaiologos pledged to not attack the Venetian possessions of Modon and Coron, and the Venetian islands of the Aegean, and to respect the treaty between Venice and the Prince of Achaea concerning Negroponte. # The Venetians would be allowed to settle in Constantinople and any other part of the Empire. This would no longer be in designated quarters provided by the Emperor, but they would be free to rent their own houses, baths, and bakeries on fixed terms, and would have the right to use their own weights and measures and have their own Latin Rite churches. The obligation to pay rent was new, but Venetian merchants would again, as before, be exempt from any taxes in the Empire. # The Genoese could remain in the Empire—in a marked departure from the treaty of 1265—on the understanding that both Genoese and Venetians would not engage in mutual hostilities between Abydos on the entrance of the Dardanelles, and the northern entrance to the Bosporus on the Black Sea. If either side broke this arrangement, the Emperor would act as arbiter. # If any Venetian were to die on Byzantine territory, then the disposition of his goods should be entrusted to the Venetian rectors or the bailo, or by other Venetians, without interference from the Byzantine authorities. # Any Venetian vessel or crew suffering shipwreck would receive any assistance possible from the Byzantine authorities to recover their goods.Hyperpyron of Michael VIII Palaiologos # Venetian ships were allowed to purchase grain anywhere in the Empire and export it without restriction, except to lands hostile to the Empire, for as long as its price remained at 50 gold hyperpyra to the 100 modioi; if the price should rise, then export would be allowed only under explicit license by the Emperor. # In the case of a Venetian accused of killing a Byzantine, or another Venetian in Constantinople, the case would be judged by the Emperor, but another offense against a Byzantine, or a murder against another Venetian outside Constantinople, would be judged by a Venetian rector or the bailo. # Any damage incurred on Byzantine territories by Venetian corsairs would be restituted by the bailo, who would also be responsible for bringing them to trial. Venice also promised not to provide any assistance to, or even harbour, corsairs acting against the Empire. Acts by Venetians ruling some of the Aegean islands, who were not subject to the Republic, were explicitly exempted from this agreement. Notably, no reference was made to Byzantine corsairs in the agreement, despite their active presence across the region. # Byzantine merchants would have the right to come to Venice and trade in whatever merchandise they wished, without impediment. Aftermath The treaty quickly bore fruit for the Byzantines: in September 1269, Charles of Anjou sent the Achaean knight Erard d'Aunoy and the abbot of Monte Cassino as envoys to Venice to enlist the Republic in his designs against Palaiologos, but the Doge declined, citing the truce. The Venetian stance reflected both their satisfaction, for the time being, with having again secured commercial access in the Byzantine Empire, as well as their disquiet at Charles' policies in the Adriatic, including a recent agreement with Hungary, traditionally a rival of Venice in Dalmatia. In 1272, as the truce neared its expiration, envoys from Charles, Baldwin, and Palaiologos were all present in Venice. The Byzantine ambassadors brought with them 500 Venetian prisoners, apparently seized in Euboea during the campaigns of the Byzantine admiral Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos against the Lombard lords of Negroponte in the previous years; despite the truce between Venice and Byzantium, they had been crewing the Lombards' galleys. Amidst the intense diplomatic manoeuvring, including repeated warnings by Pope Gregory X not to renew the truce, the Doge preferred to cautiously wait out developments; accordingly the truce remained tacitly in force, even if it was not officially renewed. Nevertheless, the Venetians had reason to be dissatisfied, as the treaty's provisions regarding the free and safe movement of Venetian merchants and their goods were not scrupulously observed by the Byzantines: in 1278, the Doge submitted more than 300 cases of injury done to Venetian ships, merchants, and goods since 1268, at the hands of the Emperor's subjects; many of them pirates in Imperial employ, but also including soldiers, customs officials and local governors, and even, on one occasion, a sebastokrator (possibly Palaiologos' half-brother Constantine), who had robbed and murdered a Venetian archdeacon captured on a ship off the Morea. In 1270, an anti-Angevin coalition took power in Genoa, and in 1272 Palaiologos renewed his alliance with the city, now directed against Charles of Anjou. Palaiologos' diplomatic offensive continued with his rapprochement with the Papacy, which alone could either decisively further (by declaring his campaign against Constantinople a Crusade) or thwart Charles' plans. The terms posed by the Pope were harsh: the Emperor and the Eastern Church would have to confess their errors and accept papal supremacy. Faced with the build-up of Angevin naval forces and alliances, Palaiologos had to concede, and the Union of the Churches was proclaimed at the Second Council of Lyon in 1274. Although the Union proved deeply unpopular among the Byzantine Church and populace, it was a \\"diplomatic triumph\\" for Palaiologos, as the Pope recognized him as legitimate emperor of Constantinople and forbade Charles to attack him. Meanwhile, Palaiologos used the opportunity to attack his Greek and Latin rivals in Greece. Although the Venetian representatives at Lyon had vociferously protested that Venice still claimed its rights in \\"Romania\\", the advantage lay with Palaiologos, and the new Doge, Jacopo Contarini, in 1276 sent envoys to Constantinople to renegotiate the 1268 treaty. This resulted in an agreement concluded between Palaiologos and the Venetian envoy Marco Bembo on 19 March 1277. Notably, this agreement was not phrased as a treaty, but rather as a chrysobull, a deed of grant, from the Emperor to Venice. Given the volatile international situation, however, its duration was limited to two years. After its expiration, it was not renewed, and in 1281, the Venetians in the Treaty of Orvieto entered Charles' anti-Byzantine coalition, with April 1283 as the projected starting date for the expedition against Constantinople. However, Charles' designs were fatally interrupted by the outbreak of the Sicilian Vespers in March 1282 and the consequent War of the Sicilian Vespers. By the terms of the Treaty of Orvieto, a state of war existed between Venice and Byzantium. The outbreak of the Vespers had ruined Venetian chances to recover their privileged position, and for the duration of the state of war their trade with the East was interrupted, much to the advantage of the Genoese. After long negotiations, a final ten-year peace treaty, essentially renewing the 1277 agreement, was concluded in July 1285.

She was born in June 1926 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. She considered herself a freedom fighter that was good friends with the first President of Tanzania Julius Nyerere. Bibi Titi Mohammed was a member of Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), the party that fought for the independence of Tanzania. She was convicted for treason, and subsequently received a presidential pardon. Biography Early life As she was growing up in the Matumbi tribe her father refused to send her to school because he feared she would lose her Muslim faith and after her father died her mother decided to send her to school because she saw the importance of an education for a young woman. Bibi Titi's mother's influence helped Bibi fight for women's rights and helped her in her fight for independence. Marriage and children At age fourteen she married an older man and she divorced her first husband after bearing her first child, a daughter named Halima. Because of Bibi Titi's ideals and her fight her daughter was not allowed to marry until she completed school. She married and divorced two more men. Political Career Bibi Titi Mohammad began her political career as the lead singer in a ngoma (a dance and music group) where she celebrated the birth of the prophet Mohammed during Maulidi. In the 1950s after World War II she started to get involved with the Nationalist movement in Tanzania and on July 7, 1954 TANU was started by Julius Nyerere. She became a close friend of the first Julius Nyerere after being introduced to him in 1954, by the driver of a family cab. In 1955, Mohammed became the chair of the Umoja wa Wanawake wa Tanzania (UWT), which was the women's branch of TANU. Within three months of her coming into the position she was able to enroll more than 5000 women into TANU and helped play a major roll in Tanzania's fight for independence against British Colonial rule. Mohammed was able to bring the UWT's ideas to the masses and also unified women against colonialism by giving them one voice. Tanzania became an independent country in 1961 and her leadership also helped with the influence or writing the constitution in 1964 and she guaranteed a place for women in the Tanzanian government. Bibi was also known for her creation of the All African Women Conference and was the junior minister under the President Nyerere. In 1965 Bibi Titi lost her parliamentary seat which began her loss of power. By 1967 she has resigned her position in the party's central committee. She was protesting a provision in the Arusha Declaration. Which is Nyerere's plan for African socialism, the plan banned all central committee members from renting properties. Because of most women's lack of education the right to rent properties was one of the few things that will help them earn a stable income. UWT Bibi Titi Mohammed was a key player within the creation of TANU (Tanganyika African National Union), which was a major political party within Tanzania. Mohammed’s involvement began when she met Julius Nyerere, who would eventually become the first president. Mohammed was able to hold a position of leadership with TANU, mostly due to Nyerere’s belief of equality. Giving women visibility was a major priority of Nyerere’s policy, giving Mohammed the platform she needed. Bibi Titi Mohammed was the leader of the women’s wing of TANU, called Umoja wa Wanawake wa Tanzania (UWT). This organization was key in the selling and distributing the beliefs and ideals of TANU. UWT also was a great tool in united women throughout Tanzania. UWT was major source of empowerment for women all across Tanzania. This is an incredible achievement especially since history always undermines women, Mohammed and her organization help women throughout Tanzania, in doing this Tanzanian’s were able to take back their country and make it theirs again. Arrest and detention In October 1969, Bibi Titi, and the former Labour Minister Michael Kamaliza were arrested, along with four army officers, being charged with plotting to overthrow the government. Seen as in instigator of protests she was put on trial for plotting to take over Tanzanian government. Tanzania's first treason trial was held, and after the 127-day trial, Mohammed was sentenced to life imprisonment; she was put on house arrest. During the trial, her political associates disowned her, and most of her friends deserted her. While in prison her husband ashamed of her divorced her and left her alone to try to prove her innocence. After two years into her life sentence Nyerere commuted her sentence and she was released from prison. Death and afterward After Bibi Titi was released from prison she disappeared from the public life and lived the rest of her life in Johannesburg, South Africa. \\"Mwalimu Nyerere Was Firm On Women's Empowerment [analysis].\\" Africa News Service, 15 Oct. 2010. \\"'1964 Army Mutineers Were Inspired By the Zanzibar Revolution' [interview].\\" Africa News Service, 1 June 2011 In 1991, when Tanzania was celebrating 30 years of independence, Bibi Titi appeared in the ruling party's paper as \\"A Heroine of Uhuru(Freedom) Struggle\\". On November 5, 2000 Mohammed died at Net Care Hospital in Johannesburg where she was being treated. Legacy Bibi Titi Mohammed's legacy lives on in Tanzania. She played a pivotal role in education and women's equality. She fought her government for what she believed in even when it got her in trouble. One of Dar es Salaam's major roads is named after Mohammed in honour of the great achievements made by her toward Tanzanian independence.

It's formed by a yellow horizontal strip, which occupies the upper half, and a red horizontal strip, which complements the lower part. In the center is the coat of arms of the city. The yellow color means justice, virtue and kindness while the red color means liberty, health and charity. The norm also specifies that for the use of the flag as a banner its proportion will be twice as wide as it is long and for its use as a standard its proportion will be two and a half times the length of its width. The origin of the flag goes back to the Independence Cry of July 20, 1810, in which the patriots identified with a yellow and red armband. The city authorities consulted the Colombian Academy of History on October 6, 1952 about the design the flag of the city, taking into account the tradition and history. In response, academics Enrique Ortega Ricaurte and Guillermo Hernández de Alba gave a report detailing the history of the armband used by the revolutionaries and suggesting adoption as the flag of the city.

She taught physics at Newnham College, Cambridge and was a research fellow of the University of Bristol. She conducted research in X-ray physics, focusing on topics such as alpha particles, X-ray monochromatization, and spectroscopy. Her research of alpha particles proved that the theory of Gaunt can also be applied to molecular hydrogen. She also developed through her research of crystal and slit systems a quantitative general theory for analysis of composite radiation and production of monochromatic beams. She attended the University of Edinburgh and graduated with an MA and BSc in mathematics and natural philosophy. She worked as an assistant at the University of Edinburgh for two years before being appointed to a lectureship in physics at Newnham College in Cambridge. She was also a physics lecturer at the University of Bristol and later a part-time lecturer in physics at Queen Elizabeth College in London, where she was named an honorary lecturer in 1970.  Early life  Gladys Mackenzie was born on 2 May 1903 in Edinburgh to Helen Macgregor Martin, a teacher, and Lachlan Paterson Mackenzie, an iron founder. As a child, Mackenzie attended Craigmount School in Edinburgh from 1913 to 1919. She showed an early aptitude for mathematics after taking the Scottish Leaving Certificate Examinations. The first time she took the exam, she obtained a pass in Lower Mathematics, and the following year she received passes in Higher Level Mathematics, as well as in English, French and Latin.  College  Mackenzie began her higher education at the University of Edinburgh in 1919. When she joined the university, she identified Church of Scotland as her religious denomination. While attending the University, she took a wide range of classes, both at Ordinary and Honours levels. She studied Ordinary 1st and 2nd mathematics, chemistry, natural philosophy, and Philosophy. She also took many Honours level courses, such as Natural Philosophy, Mathematics, Final Natural Philosophy, Final Mathematics, Calculus, General Analysis, heat, electricity I and II, General Physics, Higher Algebra and Geometry. She graduated on 17 July 1924 with an MA and BSc in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. As a result of the large number of Honours level classes she took, she graduated with First Class Honours. Mackenzie joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society while working at the University of Edinburgh. She was elected to the Society on 6 March 1925 and left in 1930.  Alpha particles  Gladys Mackenzie was a scholar at the University of Bristol from 1929 to 1930 before becoming a Research Fellow. From the beginning of her time at the University of Bristol in 1929 to her resignation in 1947, Mackenzie conducted her most note-worthy research. She started by researching methods of measuring the ranges of alpha particles. She tested ranges of alpha particles at varying initial velocities as they travelled through gases such as air, oxygen, nitrogen, argon and hydrogen and observed the stopping power of these gases as the particles travelled through them. She discovered a relationship between the range of the alpha particles and its initial velocity and proved that the theory of Gaunt for the stopping power of hydrogen atoms is also applicable for molecular hydrogen. This research was published in 1930.  X-ray monochromatization and spectroscopy  Following this publication, she shifted her focus to the usage of crystal and slit systems for the purpose of X-ray monochromatization and spectroscopy. In regards to X-ray physics, crystal and slit systems are used for analysis of crystal structure, wave-length determination, spectroscopic analysis of composite radiation, and the production of monochromatic beams. The former two usages had already been thoroughly researched, so Mackenzie focused on the latter two which had not received as much attention. Her research developed a quantitative general theory for using crystal and slit systems for production of monochromatic beams and for analysis of composite radiation. She studied the effect of slit breadth, slit height, and crystal setting and determined that, according to her findings, the ideal design of slit systems is different from the design most commonly used. Personal life Mackenzie married physicist Wallace Russell Harper on 14 March 1929. They had one son together. Mackenzie worked as a part time teacher at the Channing School in Highgate, London from 1952 to 1958. She left this position when she was offered a part time lectureship in physics at Queen Elizabeth College in London. She retired in 1970 following her husband's death and died in 1972.

The sanctuary is mentioned by Herodotus in the 5th century BC: :\\"Between the river [Phoinix, a tributary of the Asopos River] and Thermopylai there is a village named Anthele, past which the Asopos flows out into the sea, and there is a wide space around it in which stand a temple of Demeter Amphiktyonis, seats for the Amphiktyones, and a temple of Amphiktyon himself.\\"Herodotus, Histories 7. 200 (trans. Godley) Excavations has dated the structures to the 5th-century BC. The archeological remains include a trapezoidal peribolos, identified as a large stoa and stadium, which measures north side 66.30m, south side 65.30m, east side 6.20m, west side 7.65m. The Sanctuary of Demeter Amphyctionis was known in antiquity as the place where the Pylaian or Delphic Amphictyonic council met each autumn. Demeter Amphictyonis is depicted on a coin minted by Philip II of Macedon, who took over control of the Amphictyonic League in 339 BC. The coin from 335 BC portrayed the profile of Demeter wearing a veil and a wreath of grain on the obverse, and seated Apollo on the reverse, inscribed not by the Delphian name but with 'AMΦΙΚΤΥΩΝΩΝ' (\\"Of the Amphictyons\\"). The sanctuary still existed in the age of Strabo, who described it: :There is also a large harbor here [at Thermopylai], and a temple of Demeter, in which at the time of every Pylaian assembly the Amphiktyons performed sacrificial rites.Strabo, Geography 9. 4. 17 (trans. Jones) [...] The first cities which came together [to form the Amphictyonic League to care for the shared shrines of Ancient Greece] are said to have been twelve, and each sent a Pylagoras, the assembly convening twice a year, in spring and in late autumn; but later still more cities were added. They called the assembly Pylaia, both that of spring and that of late autumn, since they convened at Pylai, which is also called Thermopylai; and the Pylagorai sacrificed to Demeter.Strabo, Geography 9. 3. 7 If still in use by the 4th century AD, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans under the Christian Emperors, when edicts where issued prohibiting all non-Christian worship.

However, it has been reported that this species can live in more temperate climates along with the closely related bed bug species C. lectularius. C. hemipterus is a hematophagous, obligate parasite of humans. This means that it requires blood meals from their human hosts in order to survive. When bitten, humans experience itchiness, wheals, and lesions around the affected areas on the skin. This species typically resides in human domiciles within cracks, crevices, or mattresses, and are more prevalent in developing countries. Like other bed bugs, C. hemipterus is primarily active during the night time.  Morphology  On average, C. hemipterus is 5.5 millimeters long and 2.5 millimeters wide. This insect has an ovular and flattened body shape. Its head is short, broad, and pointed at the tip. The rounded, black or red colored compound eyes sit laterally on both sides of the head and can be observed from both a top and underside view. A pair of four segmented antennae are found in front of both the compound eyes. The mouthparts of C. hemipterus are made for piercing skin and sucking blood from their host. In accordance to this, the three segmented labium is long and \\"straw like\\" and the maxilla and mandible are both observed to be \\"blade like\\". The thorax of C. hemipterus is three segmented, containing the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax. The prothorax is about twice as long wide as it is long, and is much larger and prominent than the head (which sits in the middle of it), and both the meso- and meta- thorax. Compared to C. lectularius, C. hempiterus is observed to have a slightly narrower prothorax. This species has an eight segmented abdomen that is rounded and has a pointed tip, which contains short tufts of hair that stick out. Color varies for this species based on whether it has recently consumed a blood meal. If it hasn't had a blood meal, it displays a pale-brown color. If it has recently had a blood meal, it displays a reddish color. Slight differences exist between sexes of C. hemipterus. Females are typically larger than males and contain a more rounded abdomen tip, unlike the pointed tip that are seen in males.  Life cycle C. hemipterus exhibits a hemimetabolous life cycle, which means the insect goes through multiple nympal life stages, where their body shape and feeding behavior closely resembles that of the adult stage. The eggs of C. hemipterus have been known to hatch anywhere from 4-12 days after being laid. This species goes through five nymphal stages before developing into an adult, with each stage of nymphs being involved in human blood-feeding. The first four nymphal stages each go through an average development time of 3-4 days, while the fifth nymphal stage develops in 4-5 days. Compared to C. lectularius, C. hemipterus goes through slightly longer developmental phases. Adults can live anywhere from 6-12 months, with females typically living longer than males.  Insecticide resistance  Following widespread use of DDT in the 20th century, DDT resistance among C. hemipterus has been reported among populations in tropical and subtropical regions. This has caused re-emergences of widespread C. hemipterus infestations in countries in the southern hemisphere, such as Australia and Sri Lanka. Resistance to pyrethroids has also been reported.  Medical importance  The primary medical concern associated with C. hemipterus is associated with the skin. When biting their hosts, they inject saliva containing a variety of components. These components include anesthetics, vasodilating compounds, and anticoagulants. These factors act to continue blood flow to the bitten area and ensure the host does not feel the bite. These bites lead to skin lesions and itchiness, which is a nuisance to humans. While bedbugs are not known for being biological vectors of disease, there is evidence to suggest they can be vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, a protist that causes Chaga's disease in humans.

It was a significant Pan- Hellenic shrine of Athena and arguably the regional center of her cult. History The sanctuary was situated at the acropolis in the city of Lindos in Rhodes, which was at that time the capital of the island. Prior to the foundation of the temple, the site appears to have been the place of the cult of a local goddess. It was built above a natural cave in the cliff, which may have been an previous cult place. The first temple is dated to the 6th-century BC. It was likely built by Cleobulus. The cult statue of Athena Lindia has been reconstructed from the votive statuettes as having been a seated figure of Athena with a polos crown. The temple was burned in 342 BC, and replaced by a new temple in the late 4th-century BC. It was built in the Doric style. It was 7.75 x 21.65 m. The new cult statue was a standing figure of Athena carrying a shield, but wearing a polos rather than a helmet; as it was fastened by the wall of the cella, it may have been over-life-size. The fame of the temple is confirmed by the fact that Alexander the Great and many of his successors offered sacrifices there, and dedicated weapons after victories. Many of its votive gifts were famous and mentioned in the Temple Chronicle, such as works of Boethus and painter Parrhasios of Ephesus. If the temple was still in use by the 4th-century, it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, when laws against non- Christian religions and their sanctuaries where enacted by the Christian emperors. Mythology The island of Rhodes was noted as a significant place for the cult of Athena in ancient times, and the sanctuary and cult of her in Rhodes are mentioned alongside to that in Athens. Rhodes was an important place in the myth of the birth of Athena, and it was said that: :\\"Gold rained on the island [of Rhodes] at the time when Athena was born from the head of Zeus.\\"Strabo, Geography 14. 2. 10 According to legend, the temple was founded by Danaus and the Danaïdes. According to Pseudo-Apollodorus (2 cd- Century BC), the temple was founded by Danaus, who dedicated a statue to Athena Lindia in his gratitude for her assistance in helping him construct a ship, by which he could help his daughters to escape: \\"Danaus, in fear of the sons of Aigyptos, under Athena's supervision built a ship (the first man to do so), put his daughters [the 50 Danaïdes] on board and escaped. Putting in at Rhodes, he dedicated the statue of Athena Lindia. From there he went to Argos.\\"Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 12 (trans. Frazer) Strabo described the temple as founded by the Danaides rather than their father: \\"In Lindos there is a famous temple of Athena Lindia, founded by the daughters of Danaüs.\\"Strabo, Geography 14. 2. 11 (trans. Jones) According to Callimachus, the cult statue of Athena by Danaus was originally composed by a xoanon before it was replaced by a sculptured statue, which indicate that the temple was quite old.Callimachus, Fragment 105 (from Eusebius Praep. Ev. 3.8) (trans. Trypanis) Pindar described the legends around the temple in the 5th-century BC: :\\"The land circled by the sea [Rhodes], where once the great king of the gods [Zeus] showered upon the city snowflakes of gold; in the day when the skilled hand of Hephaistos wrought with his craft the axe, bronze-bladed, whence from the cleft summit of her father's brow Athene sprang aloft, and pealed the broad sky her clarion cry of war. And Ouranos (Heaven) trembled to hear, and Mother Gaia (Earth). Then was it too the great god Hyperionides Helios the sun], giver of light to mortal men, this task to his beloved sons [i.e. the Heliadai of Rhodes] enjoined to ensure well hereafter : that they first to the goddess built a shining altar, and founding holy rites of sacrifice, make glad the heart of Zeus, and the maid of the sounding spear. Now Reverence, the daughter of Forethought, gives to men virtue and valour's joy. And yet comes too, on stealthy wing, that cloud of forgetfulness, drawing our baffled minds off from the straight road of their acts' intent. For they mounted aloft, but carried in their hands no seed of burning flame, but on the city's height [i.e. the acropolis of Lindos] founded a precinct without holy fire. Yet for these men Zeus brought the saffron cloud, and rained flood of gold, and the grey-eyed goddess herself endowed them the gift of skill, that of all men on earth, their hands in craft excelling have the mastery. And the roads acarried their worked images of life and movement, and widespread was their renown.\\"Pindar, Olympian Ode 7. 33 ff (trans. Conway) Cult The cult of Athena on Rhodes differed somewhat from the cult in other parts of Greece, as it required the burning of the entrails from the sacrificial animals on the altar, an act which may have been unique for Rhodes. Philostratus the Elder describe the cult on the sanctuary in 3rd century: :\\"The Birth of Athena . . . Two peoples are already sacrificing to Athena [i.e. on the day of her birth] on the acropolis of two cities, the Athenians and the Rhodians, one on the land and one on the sea, [sea-born] and earth- born men; the former offer fireless sacrifices that are incomplete, but the people of Athens offer fire, as you see yonder, and the savour of burnt flesh. The smoke is represented as fragrant and as rising with the savour of the offerings. Accordingly the goddess has come to the Athenians as to men of superior wisdom who make excellent sacrifices. For the Rhodians, however, as we are told, gold flowed down from heaven and filled their houses and their narrow streets, when Zeus caused a cloud to break over them, because they also gave heed to Athena. The divinity Ploutos also stands on their acropolis, and he is represented as a winged being who has descended from the clouds, and as golden because of the substance in which he has been made manifest.\\"Philostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 27 (trans. Fairbanks) Archeology The sanctuary was excavated by the Italian archaeologists Maiuri and Jacopi in 1910-1932, and then by the Danish archaeologists K.F. Kinch and Chr. Blinkenberg.

In 2015, the company took over naming rights of Gwinnett Center, located in Duluth, Georgia, calling it Infinite Energy Center.  History  Co-founders Darin Cook and Rich Blaser launched Infinite Energy in Gainesville, Florida, in 1994. The company started as a wholesale natural gas provider to Florida utilities and industrial customers. As retail businesses in some parts of the Florida market also got the ability to choose their own providers, Infinite Energy began serving them as well. The company continued to expand its retail service area, moving into Georgia next when the state restructured its natural gas market. Today, Infinite Energy is one of only two original providers still operating there. By 2005, the company had also expanded into New Jersey. And in 2010, it began providing electricity in Texas. In 2019, the company expanded its service area to Ohio. Infinite Energy employs more than 300 people. In 2016, the company made headlines for raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour. Florida Trend has recognized Infinite Energy multiple times as one of Florida’s best workplaces. In 2018, Inc. Magazine, a national publication, ranked Infinite Energy as one of the best places to work in the U.S. And Outside Magazine, another national publication, has recognized the company multiple years running as one of the country's best workplaces for its emphasis on employee well-being.  Infinite Energy Center  In 2015, Infinite Energy bought naming rights to the Gwinnett Center in a 20-year deal for $18 million. Infinite Energy Center, as it’s now known, is located in Duluth, Georgia, just a few minutes outside of Atlanta. The Gwinnett Convention and Visitors Bureau runs the center, which features a 13,000-seat arena, a 50,000-square-foot exhibit hall, a 21,600-square-foot grand ballroom and a 708-seat theater. In addition to being the home of the ECHL’s Atlanta Gladiators and National League Lacrosse’s Georgia Swarm, the venue accommodates many concerts, performances, tradeshows, conventions and meetings each year. The same year Infinite Energy took over naming rights of the center, the company pledged to give back $5 to the schools in Gwinnett County (where IEC is located) each year for every customer it has there.

It was one of the main cult centers of Dionysus. Thebes had an important role in the cult of Dionysus as the place of several important events of the divine myths of the god. It was believed to be the place of the immolation of Semele, and contained what was said to be her tomb. The temple was situated near the theater in the city of Thebes. It was dedicated to the god under the name of Dionysus Lysios. Pausanias described the sanctuary in the 1st century: :\\"Near the Proitidian gate [of Thebes, Boiotia] is built a theater, and quite close to the theater is a temple of Dionysos surnamed Lysios (Deliverer). For when some Theban prisoners in the hands of Thrakians had reached Haliartia on their march, they were delivered by the god, who gave up the sleeping Thrakians to be put to death. One of the two images here the Thebans say is Semele. Once in each year, they say, they open the sanctuary on stated days. There are also ruins of the house of Lykos, and the tomb of Semele.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 9. 16. 6 Aside from the Temple of Dionysus Lysios, Pausanias also writes: :\\"... there is also a story that along with the thunderbolt hurled at the bridal chamber of Semele there fell a log from heaven. They say that [King] Polydoros adorned this log with bronze and called it Dionysos Kadmos. Near is an image of Dionysos; Onasimedes made it of solid bronze. The altar was built by the sons of Praxiteles.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 9. 12. 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.) This was however the Shrine to Dionysus Kadmeios, which was different shrine in Thebes, separate from that of Dionysus Lysios.

The film was created using original footage of the First World War from the Imperial War Museum's archives, most previously unseen, all over 100 years old by the time of release. Audio is from BBC and Imperial War Museum (IWM) interviews of British servicemen who fought in the conflict. Most of the footage has been colourised and transformed with modern production techniques, with the addition of sound effects and voice acting to be more evocative and feel closer to the soldiers' actual experiences. It is Jackson's first documentary as director. Jackson, whose grandfather (to whom the film is dedicated) fought in the war, intended for the film to be an immersive experience of \\"what it was like to be a soldier\\" rather than a story or a recount of events. The crew reviewed 600 hours of interviews from 200 veterans and 100 hours of original film footage to make the film. The title was inspired by the line \\"They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old\\" from the 1914 poem \\"For the Fallen\\" by Laurence Binyon, famous for being used in the Ode of Remembrance. They Shall Not Grow Old premiered simultaneously at the BFI London Film Festival and in selected cinemas in the UK on 16 October 2018, before airing on BBC Two on 11 November 2018 (the hundredth anniversary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918); it received a limited US release on 17 December. Following its box office success, the film received a wide theatrical release in February 2019 (the film's theatrical release was handled by Warner Bros. Pictures). It was acclaimed by critics for its restoration work, immersive atmosphere and portrayal of war, and earned a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary.  Production  The film was co- commissioned by 14–18 NOW and Imperial War Museums in association with the BBC, who approached Jackson in 2015 for the project. According to Jackson, to make the film, the crew of They Shall Not Grow Old reviewed 600 hours of interviews from the BBC and the IWM and 100 hours of original film footage from the IWM. The interviews came from 200 veterans, with the audio from 120 of them being used in the film. After receiving the footage, Jackson decided that the film would not feature traditional narration and that it would instead only feature audio excerpts of the soldiers talking about their war memories, in order to make the film about the soldiers themselves; for the same reason, it barely features any dates or named locations. Jackson stated: \\"We made a decision not to identify the soldiers as the film happened. There were so many of them that names would be popping up on the screen every time a voice appeared. In a way it became an anonymous and agnostic film. We also edited out any references to dates and places, because I didn’t want the movie to be about this day here or that day there. There's hundreds of books about all that stuff. I wanted the film to be a human experience and be agnostic in that way. ... I didn't want individual stories about individuals. I wanted it to be what it ended up being: 120 men telling a single story. Which is: what was it like to be a British soldier on the western front?\\" In another interview, he stated \\"[The men] saw a war in colour, they certainly didn't see it in black and white. I wanted to reach through the fog of time and pull these men into the modern world, so they can regain their humanity once more – rather than be seen only as Charlie Chaplin-type figures in the vintage archive film.\\" Jackson's own paternal grandfather, Sgt. William Jackson, to whom the film is dedicated, was British and fought in the First World War; Peter grew up with his father telling him his grandfather's war stories. Jackson stated that after making the film, he now had \\"a greater understanding of what my grandfather would have gone through\\". Jackson did not receive any fee for the making of the film. Although only a small part of it was used, Jackson's crew visually restored all 100 hours of footage the Imperial War Museums sent them for free, \\"just to get their archive in better shape\\". It was produced by WingNut Films with House Productions as executive producers and was supported by the UK's National Lottery through the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Music The music was composed by New Zealand trio Plan 9, consisting of David Donaldson, Steve Roche and Janet Roddick. The closing credits of the film feature an extended version of the song \\"Mademoiselle from Armentières\\", which was particularly popular during the war. Jackson decided late in the production to use the song and there was little time to assemble the performers. Rather than have non-British men try to sing in British accents, native speakers in service to the UK government were recruited from the British High Commission in New Zealand.  Release  The film premiered on 16 October 2018 as a Special Presentation at the BFI London Film Festival, in the presence of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, while also being released in several selected cinemas across the country; copies were also sent to UK schools the same day. The film was simultaneously screened in 2D and 3D at cinemas, schools and special venues across the UK. The simulcast included a special post-screening Q&A; with Jackson, hosted by the film critic Mark Kermode. The film was broadcast on BBC Two on 11 November 2018, the one-hundredth anniversary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918. To accompany the film, a special episode of the documentary series What Do Artists Do All Day? which followed Peter Jackson making the film aired the following day on BBC Four. The film received a special United States release through Fathom Events in 2D and 3D, on 17 and 27 December 2018. Warner Bros. launched a theatrical release in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, DC, on 11 January 2019 with plans to expand to 25 markets on 1 February. Because it missed the 1 October 2018 filing deadline, the film was deemed ineligible for consideration for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 91st Academy Awards; because it is still a 2018 film, it was also ineligible for the ceremony the following year.

Critical response  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 99% based on 148 reviews, with an average rating of 8.72/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"An impressive technical achievement with a walloping emotional impact, They Shall Not Grow Old pays brilliant cinematic tribute to the sacrifice of a generation.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating based on reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\"; it is labeled as a \\"Metacritic must-see\\". Giving the film a five-star rating, Peter Bradshaw in his review for The Guardian called it \\"a visually staggering thought experiment\\", saying \\"The effect is electrifying. The soldiers are returned to an eerie, hyperreal kind of life in front of our eyes, like ghosts or figures summoned up in a seance. The faces are unforgettable. ... The details are harrowing, as is the political incorrectness of what the soldiers recall: some express their candid enjoyment of the war, others their utter desensitisation to what they experienced.\\" Guy Lode of Variety called the film \\"a technical dazzler with a surprisingly humane streak\\", stating \\"if They Shall Not Grow Old is head-spinning for its jolting animation of creakily shot battle scenes—tricked out with ingeniously integrated sound editing and seamlessly re-timed from 13 frames a second to 24—its greatest revelation isn't one of sound and fury. Rather, it's the film's faces that stick longest in the mind. Through the exhaustive transformation completed by Jackson's team, visages that were all but indistinguishably blurred in the archives take on shape, character and creases of worry, terror and occasional hilarity. In conjunction with the film's intricately stitched narration, its soldiers turn from cold statistics to warm, quivering human beings, drawing us with renewed empathy into a Great War that, they all but unanimously agree, had precious little greatness to it.\\" Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter stated that the film \\"suggests new cinematic methods of rescuing history from history books, humanizing and dramatizing true stories with a modest injection of movie-world artifice. Some critics may object to how Jackson streamlines and elides real events, stripping away specifics while offering no broader socio- political comment on the war. But as an immersive primer on the first-hand experiences of British soldiers, this innovative documentary is a haunting, moving and consistently engaging lesson in how to bring the past vividly alive.\\" Mike McCahill of IndieWire gave the film a B grade, considering that \\"the filmmaker's extensive restoration project doesn't always provide new insights, but it succeeds at creating a fresh look at the horrors of WWI.\\" The response was not universally positive however, and particularly among archivists and film historians some concerns were raised about the ways in which the film erased the original filmmakers, manipulated the image through colourization and other techniques and implied that the original footage (much of which had been extensively restored by the IWM archives) was in disrepair.

History The M1877 was first designed and produced by the Obukhov State Plant in Saint Petersburg and was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar guns with similar roles such as the French Canon de 240 L Mle 1884 or British BL 10 inch gun Mk I – IV. Design The M1877 was a short barreled breech-loading gun. The barrel was a typical built-up gun of the period with reinforcing hoops which was built from cast iron and steel. The gun had an early form of Krupp horizontal sliding-block breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. Coastal Defense In the coastal defense role, the M1877 was mounted on a garrison mount which sat on a concrete slab behind a parapet. The mount consisted of a rectangular steel firing platform with a pivot at the front and two wheels at the front and rear to give 120° of traverse. The recoil system for the M1877 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffers under the rear slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned the gun to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. Due to its limited angle of elevation 20°, the M1877 was a low-angle direct fire weapon instead of a high-angle indirect-fire coastal defense mortar like many of its contemporaries. Fortress & Siege Gun In the fortress and siege gun roles, the M1877 used the same type of garrison mount as in the coastal defense role. Due to their weight, the guns were not designed to be mobile. After a string of Russian defeats in the first two years of the war, a number of M1877's were captured by the Germans. In 1916 the Germans transferred four M1877's to the Western Front where they were assigned to heavy artillery battalions of the army. Details of their employment are unknown and all are believed to have been withdrawn before 1918. However, since they didn't have very good range and they weren't capable of high angle fire they may have been used in their original coastal defense role instead of in a siege artillery role. In German service the guns had better range due to more efficient smokeless powder and more aerodynamic German projectiles. Photo Gallery File:Suomenlinna_gun_6.jpg|An 11-inch M1877 at Suomenlinna.

The case surrounding his murder series is considered to be one of the biggest professional mistakes of Hungarian law enforcement at the time, as an innocent man was initially condemned for them.  The first murder  Kovács worked as a truck driver in the area around Martfű, often travelling around the various settlements and had a good knowledge of the terrain in the outskirts of the inhabited area that he used in his first murder. Unlike most serial killers, Kovács was considered an average man with a normal background, who had built his own family and house and was well regarded to by his employer. On July 22, 1957, Kovács went to see an Argentine movie in the local cinema. In one scene from the film, a man behaved violently towards a woman. This scene excited Kovács so much that he decided that he wanted to be that violent towards a woman too. He exited the movie theater and headed to the Tisza Cipő shoe factory, at the gate of which the workers were just finishing their afternoon shift. There he caught a glimpse of a lone girl who was walking home towards Tiszaföldvár on a dirt road. Although he did not know the woman, he bicycled after her in an unlit street. While in the dark, Kovács struck a heavy blow to the victim's skull with a piece of iron. The victim, now unable to defend herself, was raped, choked to death just like in the movie, and finally disposed of in a drainage ditch. (The death was not caused by blow to the head or strangulation, but by suffocation). Kovács, after hiding the victim's body, then returned home. The corpse was found the next day by workers. The police quickly explored the victim's personal relationships and became aware of one such relationship at work - she had a friendly, but emotionally insufficient, relationship with her colleague, János Kirják. The police brought him for questioning, but Kirják gave contradicting statements. His alibi, provided by his mother, could not be proven. Investigators believed that he had waited for the victim to go home and asked her to let him go with her, but the woman's rejection made Kirják so angry that he killed her. The investigators continued to pressure him into confessing, while the Martfű population become more and more outraged. In the end, Kirják finally broke down and signed a confession. Meanwhile, Péter Kovács appeared in a massive crowd on an on-site reconstruction of the murder. Based on evidence presented by the prosecution and his own written confession, János Kirják was sentenced to death by the Szolnok County Court. The Supreme Court of Hungary reconsidered the verdict after renegotiations, and so the innocent man was instead sentenced to life imprisonment in Szeged's Star Prison.  1960s attacks  The first murder was not followed up by Kovács for a long period of time. In the meantime, he married and built a house for his family, but the founding of a family was only a temporary deterrent. On the night of November 13, 1963, he attacked a woman in the village of Homok; he struck the woman with a hammer and tore her clothes off, but he was unable to finish the murder for unknown reasons. The unconscious victim was found soon after, and her life was saved through rapid medical intervention. Half a year later, on March 21, 1964, another unfinished murder occurred in the neighborhood when Kovács attacked a lone passer-by, but the victim was barely missed by the neck from the back of the hammer and managed to escape. On May 4, 1964, a woman's corpse was found in the vicinity of Nagyrév. The body was in a bad state, and it was estimated that it had been in the water for about a month. No sign of a crime was found, and the cause of death was listed as drowning. In April 1965, the body of a teenage girl was found in the Tisza River. No signs of a crime could be found on the badly- wounded corpse, and so the conclusion was that the girl had committed suicide. But then the police came to realise that there could be a serial killer roaming the area, as there were several similar motifs found in both cases. Between April and May 1965, authorities conducted a thorough examination involving 40 men in the area, including Péter Kovács. However, since he was a man with a well-established family and work background, he was excluded from the list of potential perpetrators, and so the investigation ended up without any results.  Arrest, trial and execution  On June 20, 1967, another female corpse was found, this time near the Körös river near Öcsöd. The woman had been abused roughly before her death, with her skull bruised and her body mutilated. Blood and tissue residues were also found on the boundary of the nearby Körös Bridge, assuming that the body was thrown off from the bridge into the river. Investigators re-examined the possibility of a connection between young female corpses found in nearby rivers and the murder of a local woman. Due to the victim's skull injury, the identity of the perpetrator who murdered the woman and the perpetrator who disposed of corpses near river bridges was matched. Soon enough, the authorities found a valuable trace: a small piece of glass found under the victim's nail. Péter Kovács, who was found to be missing for a day before the body was found, used the work truck for his own needs, along with his blacksmith brother-in-law, so he had the opportunity to commit the murders. By that time, however, Kovács's wife confirmed her husband's alibi, but the investigators did not believe the woman and continued their reconnaissance work. While examining the corporate truck driven by Kovács, they found glass shards on the driver's seat. It turned out that on June 19, Kovács accidentally caught his motorcycle to the closing chain of the shoe factory, breaking the truck's windshield. The same fragments were found on his clothing as well. Investigators' efforts to find witnesses were also successful as well, and more eyewitnesses were found who saw Kovács, his brother-in-law and the victim in a pub. The killer was finally arrested on August 11, 1967, after his brother-in-law had been summoned: the man confessed that they had fun with the victim, leaving the woman to Kovács, who would drive her home. He initially denied involvement, but two days later admitted to murdering the woman. By the end of August, Kovács admitted to several women around Tisza. By February 1968, the prosecutor knew that he had murdered the girl near the Tisza Cipő shoe factory, and not the convicted Kirják.Multiple Assassin ; South-Hungary , 15 October 1967; p11 Kovács was also questioned about another murder, but he could be summoned for it. The innocent János Kirják was released after 11 years behind bars, while Péter Kovács, who admitted to four murders and two unsuccessful attacks, was sentenced to death by the Szolnok County Court, with the verdict upheld by the Supreme Court. His subsequent request for clemency was rejected by the Presidential Council, and he was hanged on December 1, 1968. It can be assumed that Péter Kovács could be responsible for more murders that the ones known, but no more bodies could be located.  In the media  In 2015, Árpád Sopsits began filming a movie about Kovács titled The Martfű Monster. On November 10, 2016, the film debuted, with Kovács (renamed to Pál Bognár) being played by Hadjuk Károly.In Warsaw, the Martfű Monster was introduced The film, of course, does not follow reality completely, as the Dr. Bálint Barna did not dive into the Körös part of the case and the death after the investigation.

Ramakrusna was the Raja of the small princely state of Jalantara in the southern part of Odisha that borders Andhra Pradesh. Although attributed to the Raja, the majority of the text may have been written by poet Gaurahari Parichha of Paralakhemundi. While multiple other plays on the same theme exist, Ramakrusna's is generally considered the best example of the routine and was imitated by other Rajas, including Kishore Chandra Harichandan Jagaddeb Ray of Surangi, Padmanabha Narayana Deba of Paralakhemundi, and Ramachandra Suradeo of Tarala. The original manuscript was preserved in the Madras Oriental Manuscript Library and collected by the Directorate of Culture of the Government of Orissa on March 8, 1938, and securely kept in the erstwhile Ravenshaw Library (now Kanika Library). The Odisha State Museum kept a paper manuscript of the text, copied some time in the 1920s. In the last century, as many as 172 troupes performed the play in the Ganjam district. As of the late 1990s, the play was performed by approximately 57 village theatre companies, due to dwindling audiences. Only about fifty troupes exist today, as the number of professional Rajas declined from 150 to 20.  Performance  Guru Simanchala Patro, renowned for his musical prowess and lively abhinaya of Hiranyakasyapa. He received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in the year 1990 for his contribution to the art form.Each performance lasts 12 hours. The complete play, as enacted in royal courts of Odisha's southern gadajatas, often took as long as 7 nights. Prahallada Nataka has multiple characters, but only a few remain relevant throughout the play. These include Hiranyakasyapa 'Raja'; his wife, Lilabati; their son, Prahallada; and the sutradhara. Occasionally, Hiranyakasyapa's ministers Biprachitti and Trimastaka, along with the sentry, or duari, occupy the stage throughout the play. Female characters are portrayed by male actors. Prahallada Nataka is performed in an open-air setting. It uses a unique seven-stepped platform called the mancha. This is wooden platform, around six feet high. The top of the platform has an area of abour 6 x 4 feet, on which is placed the throne of Hiranyakasyapa. The mancha is usually collapsible and easily dismantled. It is erected before the performance begins. The space in front of the mancha is used as the stage. This space is identified as Hiranyakasyapa's Royal Court (containing seven steps that represent his overlordship of the seven worlds). A chair fitted on top of the platform acts as his throne. A temporary pillar is constructed opposite to the Mancha for the last scene, where Nrusingha emerges. The mask used for Nrusingha is usually one or two centuries old. It receives regular worship in a village shrine throughout the year and is worn only during a performance. As a mark of respect, the performers maintain ritual purity, which usually means abstaining from non-vegetarian food and liquor.  Music  Music is the life of Prahallada Nataka. Since music is dominant, the lead singer, also known as the Gahaka must be an excellent vocalist. He also has to memorise the entire repertoire of songs. The Gahaka, apart from being the singer also acts as the interpreter, commentator and director of the performance. He does not have any elaborate makeup or costume but has specific songs and dialogues. He sings eulogies of deities, introduces the audience to situations and speaks the asides of a character. As an interpreter, he has the task of explaining to lay spectators the cryptic dialogues of the play. This is the reason why the Gahaka is also known as the Sutradhara in the tradition, allied to the use of the term 'Sutradhara' in Sanskrit plays. Prahallada Nataka has a repertoire of over three hundred songs. All the songs are classical, based on Odissi music and employ traditional ragas & talas unique to the Odissi tradition. Dhyana-shlokas of the respective ragas are sung before beginning any given song. The songs frequently employ padi, a characteristic feature of Odissi music. The percussion instrument used in the music of Prahallada Nataka is a mardala. The ensemble, which typically stands on one side of the mancha, includes Mardala, Mukhabina, Gini, Jhanja, and a Harmonium.  Recognition  Several performers have received awards from the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India. These include Raghunath Satpathy (1980), Simanchal Patro (1990), Krishna Chandra Sahu (2000) as Akademi Awardees and Brundaban Jena (2006), Pramod Kumar Nahak (2008) as Yuva Puraskar Awardees.
