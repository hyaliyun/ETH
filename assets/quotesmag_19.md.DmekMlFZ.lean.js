legislative election"},{"id":"60035864","text":"Gangs of Madras is a 2019 Indian Tamil-language action crime film written, directed, and produced by C. V. Kumar. The film stars Sai Priyanka Ruth and Ashok in the main lead roles alongside an ensemble supporting cast including Daniel Balaji, Velu Prabhakaran, P. L. Thenappan, Aadukalam Naren, E. Ramdoss, Bagavathi Perumal, and Vikas playing supportive roles. The film released on 12 April 2019. Plot The story opens with a female voice narrating about herself and her love story with Ibrahim (Ashok). Ibrahim works for Mohammad Rowther (Velu Prabhakaran) a goon who deals with drugs. He marries Jaya (Priyanka Ruth) under her parents' disapproval, and she converts to Islam, changing her name as Razia. Everything seems to go well when one fine day, Ibrahim is shot dead in an encounter in front of Razia. This also leads Razia to suffer a miscarriage, and she avenges to kill everybody involved in Ibrahim's encounter. Razia seeks the help of Abdullah (E. Ramdoss), who reveals the real motive of Ibrahim's encounter. He tells that Rowther's younger son Hussain (Vikas) eyes upon Razia and is warned by his family members as she is someone else's wife. A ruffle happens in the gang, and the police is pressured to encounter someone from the gang to put an end to the issue. Hussain suggests Ibrahim's name so that he can marry Razia. Razia is then sent to Mumbai to meet Boxie (Daniel Balaji), who at first looks at her meanly but later understands her willpower. He keeps her in his gang and trains her to kill Rowther and his gang. Finally, a well-trained Razia lands up at Chennai and kills Kareem (Lawrence Ramu), the elder son of Rowther, as well as the police who were involved in Ibrahim's encounter. Rowther comes to know about the motto of his son's murder and orders Lala Settu (Vijay) and Edison (Saivam Ravi) to kill everybody who is responsible for his son's murder. Lala Settu tricks Boxie by offering him help to do his drug business in Chennai in the place of Rowther and then kills Boxie and his henchmen. Meanwhile, Razia goes hunting for Hussain and kills him. The police catches her, and they help her kill Rowther as they could not arrest him and stop his drug business as he had Minister Tamizhvaanan's (P. L. Thenappan) support. Later, Lala Settu and Edison are killed by the police, and Razia also lets the police shoot her. In the end credits, the police are praised for their mission, and Deputy Commissioner Ramachandran (Aadukalam Naren) helps Razia's sisters get jobs in the police department in return for the favour that she did to the police department.

At the age of 14 became interested in jazz when she attended Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. Her mentor there was the drummer Bill Wysaske, who later also produced her first album and supervised her trio. At 17 she got a commitment to perform at UCLA for three weeks.

She started as a contortionist street performer as a child, then appeared in internationally touring works by James Thi√©rr√©e and others, including La Symphonie du Hanneton (The Junebug Symphony). She founded her own company, Cie L'Oubli√©(e), in 2012, and began to produce and direct as well as perform, creating the internationally touring productions L'Oubli√©(e) (The Forgotten) and La Chute des Anges (When Angels Fall) among other works. Boitel has also worked as a television and film actress, and as a choreographer for opera, including at La Scala.  Early life  Boitel was born in 1984, the youngest of four children. Their father died in 1986, and from that time, Boitel's mother, Lilou, decided she would \\"follow her children and serve them\\". When the children wanted to study circus arts, their mother did not object, but could not afford the fees. The children took up street performance on the road between Collioure and C√©ret to earn the money: eight-year-old Boitel worked as a contortionist, while her brother Camille rode unicycle and juggled. They earned enough for a 1992 summer workshop of the √âcole Nationale du Cirque led by Annie Fratellini in Nexon, Haute-Vienne, in central France. When Fratellini saw them paying with 5,000 francs in small change, and explaining that they earned it by their performances, she was so touched that she admitted the family to the main Paris school for free. The family left Montauban where they had been living, and stayed in Paris for five years. At the circus school, they were noticed by film director Coline Serreau, who cast them in minor roles in La Belle Verte (1996). Another actor in the film was Swiss circus performer James Thi√©rr√©e, who became a family friend.  Career   Circus performer  Boitel with James Thi√©rr√©e in La Veill√©e des Abysses in Genoa in 2008 In 1996, the Boitel family joined Thi√©rr√©e and performed at Indre-et- Loire, where Rapha√´lle Boitel was small enough to contort herself into a tiny box. She first toured internationally in 1998, in a major role in Thi√©rr√©e's La Symphonie du Hanneton (The Junebug Symphony), when she was 13 years old. She appeared as a contortionist (described by a Los Angeles Times critic as \\"boneless\\"), did acrobatics on a rope and on the trapeze. Her mother Lilou toured with the company, where she did costume design, and made sure Boitel continued her schooling by correspondence. La Symphonie du Hanneton toured until 2005, after which Boitel continued to perform internationally in other works, including Graham Eatough's Futurology:A Global Revue in 2007, and Spiegelworld's Desir in 2008. Then she returned to join Thi√©rr√©e in La Veill√©e des Abysses (Bright Abyss) until 2010.  Director  Boitel founded her own performance company, Cie L'Oubli√©(e), in 2012. The first work she directed for the company was also called L'Oubli√©(e) (The Forgotten) in 2016. It was a combination of theatre, circus arts, and dance, about a woman going through three ages while searching for the man she loves, played by Boitel, her sister Alice, and their mother Lilou. In addition, brother Silv√®re was sound director, and Lilou did costume design. In 2013, Boitel produced and directed a 30-minute piece named Consolations ou interdiction de passer par dessus bord for three graduates of the Fratellini school, about love between a juggler, a dancer, and an acrobat performing on a cruise ship. In 2015, Boitel followed up to create the longer 5es Hurlants, based on the everyday life of circus performers, their continued practice, failures, and perseverance. Each performance starred five graduates of the Fratellini school, including the three from Consolations, and used actual costumes that belonged to Annie Fratellini and her husband and school co-founder Pierre √âtaix. La B√™te Noire (The Black Beast) was a 2017 25-minute solo piece that Boitel created and performed, about the inner struggles of a woman acrobat, whose work bruises her body but also provides happiness. In 2018‚Äì2019, Boitel produced and directed La Chute des Anges (When Angels Fall), a circus and dance performance about a dystopian future where work and machines silence individuality, until one character starts to whisper to the light. Her mother, now Lilou Herrin, did costumes and appeared as a character.  Choreographer Boitel first provided choreography for an opera in 2013, for Verdi's Macbeth at La Scala, for director Giorgio Barberio Corsetti. In 2015 she provided dance choreography for La belle H√©l√®ne at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet. In 2017, she carried out choreography for Alcyone at the newly refurbished Op√©ra-Comique, where she was noted for introducing circus elements to the 18th century opera.  Actress  Boitel continued to work as an actress, playing minor roles in films, an appearance on TV series Nicolas Le Floch in 2010, and four episodes of Candice Renoir in 2012‚Äì2014.

History The union was founded in 1887 by postal sorters working outside London. Those in London had already attempted and failed to form a lasting union, and soon afterwards succeeded in forming the Fawcett Association, which remained a rival to the UKPCA. The UKPCA also began recruiting post office counter clerks and writers. The union was initially based in Liverpool, and never developed strength outside North West England. From 1895, it was instead run from Manchester. In 1901, the union affiliated to the Trades Union Congress. In 1906, the union's executive proposed affiliation to the Labour Party, but members heavily rejected the idea, and the union instead adopted a position of being non-political. The union discussed a potential merger with the Fawcett Society in 1907, but members were apathetic, and this did not proceed. Despite this, the union continued to grow, employing Lucy Withrington as its women's officer from 1908, and reaching 7,724 members by 1912. In 1911, the union instead began discussing a potential merger with the Postal Telegraph Clerks' Association. This was achieved in 1914, with the new union becoming known as the Postal and Telegraph Clerks' Association.

Biography Wayne attended Leeds Central High School from 1914 to 1920 and then matriculated at the University of Leeds, graduating there in 1923 BSc in chemistry and in 1924 MSc after working on organic chemistry. He then went to the University of Manchester to do research under Hugh Stanley Raper on the intermediary metabolism of the fatty acids. Wayne graduated there in 1925 with a PhD. He took classes in anatomy and physiology during a postdoctoral year of research at Manchester and then returned in 1926 to Leeds to study medicine, graduating MB, ChB in 1929. From 1930 to 1931 he was a demonstrator in physiology at the University of Leeds. From 1931 to 1934 Wayne worked as an assistant under the cardiologist Thomas Lewis in the department of clinical research at University College Hospital, London. He qualified MRCP in 1932. From 1934 to 1953 he was Professor of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Sheffield, \\"establishing a reputation as a clinical scientist and as a talented director of research.\\" He also became an associate physician to Sheffield Royal Infirmary. He was elected FRCP in 1937 and graduated MD in 1938. In 1953, as successor to Sir John William McNee, Wayne was appointed Regius Professor of the Practice of Medicine at Glasgow University. He held the professorship until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1967. He was the Bradshaw Lecturer in 1953 and the Lumleian Lecturer in 1959. He was elected FRCPE in 1955. He was knighted in 1964. In 1932 in Scarborough, North Yorkshire he married Honora Nancy Halloran. Upon his death in 1990 he was survived by his widow, a son, and a daughter. Wayne's diagnostic index By using a statistical procedure partially based on discriminant analysis, James Crooks, I. P. C. Murray, and Edward J. Wayne developed a clinical diagnostic index (sometimes called the \\"Wayne score\\") in thyrotoxicosis. The procedure allocates a positive or negative score to each clinical feature and provides a numerical estimate of the degree of severity of the disease. Older generations of endocrinologists were familiar with the use of Wayne's score and Billewicz's score for clinical diagnoses of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, respectively. Contemporary medical textbooks have discarded those two diagnostic scores as old-fashioned. However, various scoring and grading systems in clinical thyroidology might still have value.

The squats are grouped together in the Coordination of Refugee Squats. Notable projects included 5th School and City Plaza. In late 2019, the New Democracy party declared it would evict all the squats.  Background  Following the 2008 financial crisis, a Greek government-debt crisis prompted the European Troika to implement austerity policies in the form of three distinct memoranda, despite public protest. Widespread poverty and unemployment led to unstable political conditions, and high percentages of housing and storefronts sat unoccupied. Emerging as an alternative to and critique of EU policies and practices, activists in Greece have explored alternative solutions to the crisis of poverty faced by Greek citizens and have established networks of solidarity within the far-left movement. Representing an unprecedented influx, upwards of one million migrants entered Greece seeking asylum in the European Union between 2015 and 2016, peaking with the arrival of over 200,000 refugees in October 2015. Contributing factors include the escalation of the Syrian civil war and the subsequent closing of the Jordanian and Turkish borders with Syria. EU member states adopted a variety of policy responses. Balkan states were unable to control the migration via administrative mechanisms, opting to open a route deeper into Europe. In August 2015, German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the German border to asylum-seekers, voluntarily waiving the Dublin Regulation. The 2015 Paris attacks further polarized member state positions on the refugee situation.The Greek government lacked the capacity to process the arriving migrants, and under pressure from the European Commission, Greek Defense Minister Panos Kammenos allowed Frontex to assist with border management and established \\"hotspots\\" for processing refugees. It is proposed that this approach ensures the safety of local populations and migrants, by creating safer travel paths into Europe while tightly controlling where they can go. In practice, these administrative solutions have created new dangers for migrants, allowing deportation to unsafe countries and enabling their indefinite detention under poor and sometimes dangerous conditions in official camps.  History  Greek solidarity networks were activated in support of the migrants after the 2015 influx. Police evictions of newly arrived migrants from public spaces around Victoria Square drew activists to provide resources and support refugee-led protests and hunger strikes. Nearby Pedion tou Areos Park, occupied by newly arrived migrants, was similarly cleared by police. Following the evictions of the public occupations, solidarity groups assisted in securing abandoned spaces as squats for refugee settlement. In mid-2017, it was estimated that between 2500 and 3000 migrants were housed in squats in Athens. In August 2018, an informal survey suggested there were 850 people (of which total, 30% were children and 40% female) living in Athens' six refugee squats. Most squats are firmly based on principles of anti-racism, self-management, direct democracy and non- hierarchical organisation. Further the squats can be broken into four categories: # Anarchist squats which do not participate with NGOs and state actors, such as Gini, Notara 26 and Themistokleus 58. # Self-organised projects mainly run by refugees themselves such as Acharnon, Hotel Oniro and 5th School. # Feminist squats used only by women and their children, such as Strephi squat. # City Plaza which is run as an explicitly political project by leftist groups, with solidarity from across Europe. A Greek court ruled in 2017 that three squats (City Plaza, Papouchadiko and Zoodochou Pigis 119) should be evicted. Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis backed this decision, saying that the refugee crisis \\"does not legitimise anyone occupying arbitrarily public or private buildings to house those persons.\\" In protest, 700 people marched from City Plaza to the Ministry of Migration at Klafthmonos Square. Solidarity actions supporting the squats were held outside Greek embassies in Austria, Belgium and Germany. Several squats were evicted in April 2019, including three refugee squats (Azadi, Clandestina and New Babylon). Fifty evicted refugees set up a tent camp outside the Greek Parliament at Syntagma Square. After a few days they agreed to be moved to the official Elaionas camp. At the end of August 2019, police arrested around 100 people in dawn raids on squats. New mayor Kostas Bakoyannis had promised to take action and criticised previous mayor Kaminis for being too soft. One month previously, the freshly elected new Prime Minister (and uncle of Bakoyannis) Kyriakos Mitsotakis of the New Democracy party had promised to impose order on the district of Exarcheia. This central districts houses at least 23 anarchist and migrant squats, and has long been the base for Greece‚Äôs radical left social movements. By the end of September 2019, there had been seven evictions including 5th School and Spirou Trikoupi. The Ministry of Citizen‚Äôs Protection released a statement on 20 November 2019 that declared ‚ÄùThose who have illegally occupied buildings, public or private, are urged to evacuate them [...] The deadline for evacuation is fifteen days after the publication of this press release.‚Äù Commentators termed this an ultimatum and noted that the deadline would run out on 5 December. On this date, Alexandros Grigoropoulos was killed by police, an event which sparked the 2008 Greek riots. When the day came, the squats refused to leave and marches in tribute to Grigoropoulos were held in 18 cities. The evictions were broadened from migrant squats to anarchist social centres When a Christmas tree was erected on Exarcheia Square by New Democracy in December 2019, it was burned down by anarchists in solidarity with people who had been recently evicted. A replacement tree was erected and burnt down several hours later. In May 2020, the Themistokleus 58 was evicted. About 50 refugees, mainly from the Congo and Syria, were escorted out of the building.  Coordination of Refugee Squats  The squats of City Plaza, Notara 26, Oniro, Spirou Trikoupi, Arahovis, 5th School, Jasmin School and Acarchon 22 have banded together into an organization called the Coordination of Refugee Squats. In 2016, the Coordination group stated ‚ÄúAs long as they try to evict the squats, as long as they build camps and detention centers, as long as there are borders - we will also be there to fight back and fight for a better world! We will show them again what we already proved, we live together, we struggle and we resist together ‚Äì to defend the dignity of each individual, to defend our principles of solidarity.‚Äù  5th School  The 5th School Likio squat was located in Exarcheia. In 2018 it housed around 200 refugees, mainly families. It is self- managed, with residents volunteering to distribute food donations and to run the squat. Representatives of NGOs are not welcome. The self-organisation means that a Syrian former information technology worker set up the wifi network, an Arabic teacher from Syria gives weekly lessons and someone who studied hotel management in Damascus works in the kitchen. The squat was evicted in September 2019. Amongst the 143 evicted migrants were women and children from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Syria. They were taken to the Corinth camp, south of Athens. Parents' associations and teachers demanded the return of 12 children who were taken out of local schools.  City Plaza  A coalition of migrant solidarity activists called 'The Solidarity Initiative to Economic and Political Refugees' opened the City Plaza squat on April 22, 2016. The former City Plaza Hotel at 78 Acharnon, in Exarcheia, had closed its doors in 2010. Activists and refugees coordinated to organize and maintain the Hotel as an alternative to state-run camps, focused on promoting the autonomy and political agency of the residents. The City Plaza squat demanded rights for its residents while also producing these rights in the everyday life of the occupation. The squat self-defined itself as Refugee Accommodation and Solidarity Space City Plaza. Refugees and the associated solidarity groups closed the squat on July 10, 2019, two days after the electoral win of right- wing New Democracy. It was a priority of the newly incubated minister, Michalis Chrisochoidis to force refugees out of the squat. An announcement from the solidarity group stated that refugees were provided shelter elsewhere.ŒàŒªŒ∑ŒæŒµ ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ Œ±œÄœå œÑœÅŒØŒ± œáœÅœåŒΩŒπŒ± Œ∑ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨ŒªŒ∑œàŒ∑ œÉœÑŒø ŒæŒµŒΩŒøŒ¥ŒøœáŒµŒØŒø City PlazaŒàŒªŒ∑ŒæŒµ Œ∑ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨ŒªŒ∑œàŒ∑ œÉœÑŒ≠Œ≥Œ±œÉŒ∑œÇ œÄœÅŒøœÉœÜœçŒ≥œâŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒΩŒ±œÉœÑœéŒΩ City Plaza Kathimerini  Notara 26  Housing Squat for Refugees and Immigrants Notara 26 (named for its address) was the first empty building to be opened as a migrant shelter in Exarcheia in September 2015. The former tax administration offices houses people from countries such as Afghanistan, Algeria, Iran, Morocco and Syria. By summer 2016, it had housed 3500 people. It operated on anti-authoritarian principles and refused to co-operate with NGOs. By 2019, it had provided accommodation for over 9000 people.  Spirou Trikoupi  Spirou Trikoupi was a squatted building in Exarcheia. It housed around ninety migrants from places such as Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran and Kurdistan. The squat was run by a regular weekly assembly and had a bar, a library and classrooms for children. In August 2019, Spirou Trikoupi was the first squat to be raided under the policy of newly elected Kostas Bakoyannis. It was evicted by police and the migrants were taken away at gunpoint. Undocumented people were taken to detention centers and the asylum seekers were put in tent camps.

The Act came into force on 12 April 2019. Provisions For the purposes of the Act, the relevant offence is committed by creating images of, or operating equipment to view, genitals, buttocks or underwear beneath clothing where they would not normally be visible, for the purpose of sexual gratification or to cause humiliation, alarm or distress. The maximum sentence for the offence is two years' imprisonment and in the more serious sexual cases those convicted are added to the Violent and Sex Offender Register. Background Before 2019, there was no specific law against upskirting in England and Wales. When upskirting took place in public, it was outside the scope of the offence of voyeurism under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Nevertheless, prosecutions for upskirting were occasionally brought alleging the common law offence of outraging public decency, which requires the presence of at least two other people and for the act to be done in a public place. In August 2017, Gina Martin, who was upskirted at a music festival, began a campaign to reopen her case after the police closed it; Martin's case ignited a public debate over the legality of upskirting in England and Wales. The Labour Party backed her petition, which attracted over 58,000 signatures, to make the practice of upskirting illegal under the Sexual Offences Act. A freedom of information request revealed that between 2015 and 2017 there were 11 charges related to upskirting in England and Wales, but that only 15 out of 44 police forces held specific relevant records. The campaign to make upskirting a specific crime in England and Wales was supported by Conservative MP Maria Miller, Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, the End Violence Against Women Coalition, and Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, and by others. Private Member's Bill On 6 March 2018, Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse presented a Private Member's Bill to the House of Commons in support of Martin's national campaign. Justice Secretary David Gauke signalled that the government would support Hobhouse's bill, which was later supported by the Prime Minister, Theresa May. The bill was not debated at its presentation. At its second reading in the Commons on 15 June 2018, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to Hobhouse's bill, preventing its passage through the Commons. Chope said that his reason for blocking the bill's passage was in objection to parliamentary procedure rather than to the bill itself: he stated that he would \\"wholeheartedly\\" support a government bill that outlawed upskirting. Chope's actions drew immediate criticism from fellow MPs, including some in his own party. May also expressed her disappointment at the objection. In protest at his actions, staff at the House of Commons placed a bunting of women's underwear outside Chope's office entrance. A similar bunting was also placed outside his constituency office. Protestors also confronted Chope at his constituency surgery. Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University, said that by being returned to the House of Commons for debate, Hobhouse's bill could now be amended and \\"future- proofed\\" to include penalties for creators of deepfake pornographic images. McGlynn said that the bill as drafted had \\"placed too high a burden of proof on prosecutors because they had to show that a picture was taken for the purposes of sexual gratification or to cause distress\\" when \\"the unfortunate reality is that these things are often done 'for a laugh'. It's not clear to me that the current proposed legislation will cover these situations.\\" The bill which ultimately passed applies to upskirting for the purposes of \\"humiliating, alarming or distressing\\" the victim, but does not contain any provisions against deepfakes. Government Bill Following Chope's objection, the government reaffirmed its commitment to introduce legislation to outlaw upskirting. A government bill was introduced to the House of Commons on 21 June 2018. Speaking on the government's behalf in the House of Lords, Baroness Vere of Norbiton said that the legislation would also protect men wearing kilts.

She has been working since the 1970s. producing large-scale installation pieces, site- specific and a range of mixed media works. The projects she creates revolve around the idea of building relationships and bringing communities together; with most of her work involving cast members of a variety of age ranges.  Education and teaching  Lee first became interested in dance in 1974 during her teenage years; when attending weekend courses at The Place in Woking, Lee felt a sudden keen interest whilst participating in a warmup barefoot. Lee was educated in at Phyllis Adams School of Dance and Lowestoft before attending higher education. In 1981, Lee graduated from the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music & Dance with a bachelor's degree in Contemporary Dance. In 1982, Lee travelled to New York to study under the likes of Sara Pearson, Lisa Kraus and Ruth Currier. She has since become a Fellow at both C-DaRE Coventry University and Laban; worked in collaboration with Middlesex University as a ResCen Research Associate, is an ArtsAdmin artist in residence and has been the recipient of an doctorate from Roehampton University. In 1990, she choreographed Haughmond Dances which had music composed by Jane Sinclair Wells. Aside from her performance making, she is also a writer and a guest lecturer both within the United Kingdom and internationally.  Career   Common Dance, 2009  The first performance that Lee had created in conjunction with the company Dance Umbrella and Greenwich Borough Hall; a large-scale performance piece that was made up of a 50 person-strong cast, a choir and a musical arrangement composed by Terry Mann. The intent of the performance was to pay homage to the once freely occupied \\"common\\" areas that are now not as accessible in urban space.  Square Dances, 2011  The second performance associated with Dance Umbrella, Square Dances was a major- scale outdoor performance with a cast of 200 people, each carrying a bell of which size ranged from small to large. Much like Lee's 2009 work Common Dance, the creation of unity within \\"common\\" spaces and bringing people together are the focal points of the performance, spanning over four central locations in London.  Melt Down, 2011  A piece that had been commissioned by Dance Umbrella, Melt Down was another large-scale outdoor performance with a cast made up of 40 men, whose experience in performance was varied. The piece was one of four that made up the initial performance Square Dances, that was performed underneath a large tree; at the sound of a bell tolling that marked each minute passing the participants would begin to slowly descend to the ground, or \\"melt\\". This regime was repeated up to five times a day as the performance progressed, the performers moving from different locations to reenact the melt down, each segment lasting for ten minutes at a time, from not only beneath trees but in also more exposed urban and city areas.  Without, 2012-2013  A multi-screen video-installation piece Lee created in conjunction with Echo-Echo Dance Theatre and based in Derry with a musical score composed by Graeme Miller. The piece filmed up to 470 local participants, individuals from all walks of life, ascended to the streets in order to \\"reclaim\\" them.  Calling Tree, 2014  Created in collaboration with Simon Whitehead, Calling Tree is currently an on-going project, that has so far been produced in three parts located in Betws y Coed, North Wales, Tottenham and Bruce Castle Park. Beneath large trees, the participants danced, sang and whispered to the audience, creating a soundscape that resonated through the trees.

Career Dunbabin studied at the University of Oxford, and was awarded her doctorate in 1970. Her thesis was titled Studies in the mosaic pavements of Roman North Africa. When Dunbabin started her DPhil there was little English-language research into Roman art. Her first book, The mosaics of Roman North Africa: studies in iconography and patronage with the Clarendon Press, was published in 1978. It was based on her doctoral research. Barry Cunliffe described it as 'a contribution to classical studies of considerable significance, for not only does it give a thorough treatment to a body of material of outstanding beauty and interest, but in doing so it greatly enlivens our understanding of the social, economic and artistic systems which pervade the Roman world.' Her interest in the subject of Roman art continued, and in 1999 she published a book, Mosaics of the Greek and Roman World, with Cambridge University Press. A review in The Telegraph described the book as 'a masterpiece of visual, historical, technical and social analysis'. While preparing a book on mosaics, Dunbabin began researching Roman dining spaces, looking particularly at how they were decorated. This led to Dunbabin publishing a second book with Cambridge University Press, exploring how art can be used to give insight into social history. Dunbabin was a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford between January and June 2001. In 2004, Dunbabin was award a Killam Fellowship so she could dedicate time to researching the role of theatre in Roman society and Roman art. The aim was to produce a book and deliver a series of public lectures on the topic. She retired from McMaster University in 2006.

His works included the design of the main entrance and the Pavillion d'un Collecteur at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925, and the interiors of the ocean liner Normandie and other French transatlantic liners in the 1930s. Life Pierre Patout was born April 23, 1879 in Tonnerre in the Yonne Department, and died May 21, 1965 Yonne in Souzay-Champigny in the Maine-et- Loire Department. During the First World War, he was a member of the camouflage department of the French Army, under the command of the painter Lucien-Victor Guirand de Sc√©volaor, along with a number of other French artists. 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts Following the war, he worked closely with his friend the decorator Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann. The two collaborated particularly on designs for the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris from April to October 1925, the event that introduced the style and gave it its name. There were 15,000 exhibitors from twenty different countries, It was visited by sixteen million people during its seven-month run. The main purpose of the Exhibit was to promote the French manufacturers of luxury furniture, porcelain, glass, metal work, textiles and other decorative products. All the major Paris department stores and major designers had their own pavilions. Patout designed the main gateway of the Exposition on the Place de la Concorde, and also The H√¥tel du Riche Collectionneur, one of the most popular attractions at the Exposition. Inside it displayed it new furniture designs of Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, as well as Art Deco fabrics, carpets, and a painting by Jean Dupas. The interior design followed the same principles of symmetry and geometric forms which set it apart from Art Nouveau, and bright colors, fine craftsmanship rare and expensive materials which set it apart from the strict functionality of the Modernist style. The Style Paquebot His success at the 1925 Exposition led to a commission to design the interior of the newest French transatlantic ocean liner, the Ile-de-France in 1926, done entirely in the Art Deco style. This was followed by further commissions for the L'Atlantique (1930), and, the most famous of all the Normandie (1935). The highlight of the Normandie interior was the dining room, illuminated with rows of lighted columns of Lalique crystal. This style was known in France as Pacquebot, or ocean liner, and it had an important influence on the later Streamline Moderne style of Art Deco. It was so popular that Patout applied to it several buildings in Paris; a building on rue Docteur Blanche (1929); another on rue F√©licien-David; and a building on Boulevard Victor, on a narrow tapering lot, which he built to resemble a ship, with a pointed bow, long narrow terrace with railings resembling decks, and structures on the roof resembling smokestacks. He also built the Hotel M√©rc√©des on Avenue de Wagram. World's Fairs and Postwar work He continued to create exposition architecture. He designed the pavilion of Artists and Decorators for the Paris International Exposition of 1937, and designed the strikingly modern oval glass and concrete Pavilion of France for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Following World War II, he took part in the reconstruction of the city of Tours, badly damaged in the fighting. He was the architect of among other buildings in Tours, the new city public library.

He died on the 1939 American Karakoram expedition to K2, attempting to rescue a stranded climber. Biography Pasang Kikuli was one of the first generation of Sherpas to be included on the European Himalayan mountaineering expeditions. He was born Sola Khombu, Nepal in 1911 and, starting from when he was only 18 years old, he went on all three expeditions to Kangchenjunga in 1929, in 1930, and in 1931. He died in 1939 at the age of 28 leaving a widow and two young children. Climbing career He was on the 1933 British Mount Everest expedition where he reached Camp V. Hugh Ruttledge, who led the expedition, said he was one of the best porters. On the 1934 Nanga Parbat expedition he was one of the very few who came down from Camp VIII alive. He had stayed with his sahib, until he died and then he came down with other Sherpas to Camp IV by then suffering from dreadful frostbite. In 1935 his frostbite ruled out any mountaineering but in 1936 he was selected by Bill Tilman for the British‚ÄìAmerican Himalayan Expedition to Nanda Devi. Because of his frostbite he was not able to go very high but Art Emmons, one of the American climbers, said he was \\"by far the best porter, a fine personal servant, energetic, and hardworking.\\" After Tilman and Noel Odell had reached the summit (at the time at it was the highest summit ever to have been climbed), he was the only Sherpa to accompany Tilman and Charlie Houston over Longstaff's Col out of the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, the first crossing of the col. 1938 and 1939 in the Karakoram and on K2 On the 1938 American Karakoram expedition Pasang Kikuli acted as sirdar (chief Sherpa). Norman Streatfeild, the transport officer wrote, \\"A really excellent porter in every way. Good on rock and ice and always safe on a rope. Acted as Sirdar and carried out his duties admirably.\\" Next year on the 1939 American K2 expedition, Dudley Wolfe was high on K2 at Camp VII at on 28 July when all the other American climbers were at Base Camp at . Two Sherpas were at Camp IV after an abandoned rescue with instructions to reach Wolfe if they could. The leader of the expedition, Fritz Wiessner, asked two Sherpas at Base Camp to make another rescue attempt. Tsering Norbu, with Pasang Kikuli as leader, left Base Camp at 06:00, were at Camp IV by noon, and met the other Sherpas by the end of the day at Camp VI. By climbing in one day they made the sort of alpine-style Himalayan ascent only achieved decades later by western climbers. With Tsering Norbu staying at Camp VI, Pasang Kikuli, Pasang Kitar and Phinsoo reached Wolfe at noon, 29 July. Wolfe had spent 38 days continuously above and 16 days averaging without supplementary oxygen ‚Äì he was alive but in a terrible condition: no water or warm food, utterly apathetic and, because he was trapped in his tent, covered in urine and faeces. He refused to go down, telling the Sherpas to return next day when he would be ready. Back at Camp VI the Sherpas were stormbound but on 31 July the three again attempted his rescue. Pasang Kikuli, Pasang Kitar, Phinsoo and Wolfe were never seen alive again.

Extent  The area of the MPA is 0.66 km2  Boundaries  The MPA is the area below the high-water within the boundaries: *Northern boundary: S33¬∞02.806‚Ä≤, E017¬∞55.261‚Ä≤ to S33¬∞02.806‚Ä≤, E017¬∞55.862‚Ä≤ *Eastern boundary: S33¬∞02.806‚Ä≤, E017¬∞55.862‚Ä≤ to S33¬∞03.506‚Ä≤, E017¬∞55.862‚Ä≤ *Southern boundary: S33¬∞03.506‚Ä≤, E017¬∞55.862‚Ä≤ to S33¬∞03.506‚Ä≤, E017¬∞55.261‚Ä≤ *Western boundary: S33¬∞03.506‚Ä≤, E017¬∞55.261‚Ä≤ to S33¬∞02.806‚Ä≤, E017¬∞55.261‚Ä≤  Zonation   Restricted areas   Controlled areas   Management  The marine protected areas of South Africa are the responsibility of the national government, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, in this case, SANParks, which manages the MPA with funding from the SA Government through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). This MPA is managed as part of the West Coast National Park The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement.  Use   Geography   Climate  The climate of the South-western Cape is markedly different from the rest of South Africa, which is a summer rainfall region, receiving most of its rainfall during the summer months of December to February. The South-western Cape has a Mediterranean type climate, with most of its rainfall during the winter months from June to September. During the summer the dominant factor determining the weather in the region is a high pressure zone, known as the Atlantic High, located over the South Atlantic ocean to the west of the Cape coast. Winds circulating in an anticlockwise direction from such a system reach the Cape from the south-east, producing periods of up to several days of high winds and mostly clear skies. These winds keep the region relatively cool. Because of its south facing aspect Betty's Bay is exposed to these winds. Winter in the South-western Cape is characterised by disturbances in the circumpolar westerly winds, resulting in a series of eastward moving depressions. These bring cool cloudy weather and rain from the north west. The south westerly winds over the South Atlantic produce the prevailing south-westerly swell typical of the winter months, which beat on the exposed coastline.  Seasonal variations in sea conditions   Ecology  Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: Malgas Island Marine Protected Area is in the Benguela ecoregion The MPA is in the cool temperate Benguela ecoregion to the west of Cape Point which extends northwards to the Orange River. There are a moderately large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Four major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Some of these may have Kelp forests, which reduce the effect of waves and provide food and shelter for an extended range of organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. There are no significant estuarine habitats in the MPA. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near-horizontal crevices. Kelp forests Kelp forests are a variation of rocky reefs, as the kelp requires a fairly strong and stable substrate which can withstand the loads of repeated waves dragging on the kelp plants. The Sea bamboo Ecklonia maxima grows in water which is shallow enough to allow it to reach to the surface with its gas-filled stipes, so that the fronds form a dense layer at or just below the surface, depending on the tide. The shorter Split-fan kelp Laminaria pallida grows mostly on deeper reefs, where there is not so much competition from the sea bamboo. Both these kelp species provide food and shelter for a variety of other organisms, particularly the Sea bamboo, which is a base for a wide range of epiphytes, which in turn provide food and shelter for more organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. Sandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand. The open sea The pelagic water column is the major part of the living space at sea. This is the water between the surface and the top of the benthic zone, where living organisms swim, float or drift, and the food chain starts with phytoplankton, the mostly microscopic photosynthetic organisms that convert the energy of sunlight into organic material which feeds nearly everything else, directly or indirectly. In temperate seas there are distinct seasonal cycles of phytoplankton growth, based on the available nutrients and the available sunlight. Either can be a limiting factor. Phytoplankton tend to thrive where there is plenty of light, and they themselves are a major factor in restricting light penetration to greater depths, so the photosynthetic zone tends to be shallower in areas of high productivity. Zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton, and are in turn eaten by larger animals. The larger pelagic animals are generally faster moving and more mobile, giving them the option of changing depth to feed or to avoid predation, and to move to other places in search of a better food supply.

There are a moderately large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline.

Besley was also a prodigious charlatan, spinning fanciful stories regarding his birth, upbringing and career. Besley manipulated the media for decades, lying to them during their efforts to report his exploits. Biography Portrait of James Campbell Besley, circa 1905James Campbell Besley was born in Mt. Gambier, South Australia, Australia, the fourth of Mary Ann (n√©e Harvey) and Bryan Charles Besley's eight children. In 1913, during an expedition to find the source of the Amazon River, Besley's adventure was filmed by director Franklin B. Coates. The film was named The Captain Besley Expedition. A substantial portion of the expedition film footage was discovered stolen after the expedition returned to New York city. Returning a year later, another film, In the Amazon Jungles with the Captain Besley Expedition was produced. Successful as a broker of silver mines in Alaska and Mexico, a champion polo player, he later owned a riding academy in Phoenix, Arizona. Besley died in St. Kilda, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Prodigious charlatan Many believe Besley's multiple (and often contradictory) \\"histories\\". The facts prove he continually misled many, including the press about basic aspects of his birth, upbringing, education, work and avocation. He spent decades manipulating the media to mislead the world about his life history, abilities, exploits and awards. Fictitious biographical claims Besley's self-described, wildly contradictory \\"personal histories\\" were dutifully retold by an eager press. They grew longer and more elaborate over the course of his life. Over the years, many have been fooled due to an elaborate, false \\"biography\\" of Besley's life compiled in the Press Reference Library's 1913 edition of \\"Western Edition Notables of the West, Vol. I\\". Fictitious personal histories Besley claimed he had been born in London, England, traveled the world with his father from the age of seven and had served in the British Army. He claimed his father was \\"Inspector General of Forces in Australia and other British provinces\\" and an extensive landowner. James Campbell Besley's WWII US draft cardJames Campbell Besley was actually born in Australia, never served in the British Army and never held any military rank (including the ranks of Captain, Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel). Besley's father, Bryan Charles Besley was born in Oxfordshire, England in 1836 and moved with his mother and siblings to Australia in 1851. The elder Besley joined the police force, eventually becoming police Inspector-In-Charge of the largest district in Australia and also held the post of Sub-Protector of Aborigines. Besley claimed he returned to England for college and entered Eton in 1889 to prepare for Oxford. He claimed he received a degree from Eton in 1893 and immediately entered Oxford, but did not finish, having left at the end of two years to take up the study of mining and metallurgy. There are no records of a \\"James Campbell Besley\\" attending Eton or Oxford. In 1890, Besley actually served as Honorable Secretary at the Port Augusta and Flinders Jockey Club in Port Augusta, Adelaide. Besley left the Jockey Club in 1891 to join his brother Brian Charles Besley's business, B. C. Besley and Co., of Broken Hill as a stock and station agent. Besley had been arrested twice in the Yukon Territories in 1903 for embezzlement, fraud and financial malfeasance. In 1908, Besley later gave an interview claiming he had \\"come to New York after spending the past eight years in Mexico\\" and further claiming during that time he had been \\"one of the mining engineers for the late Cecil Rhodes, the former Prime Minister of the Cape Colony\\". There are no contemporary records of Besley working for Prime Minister Rhodes. Besley was a proven resident of the Yukon Territories during the claimed time frame, from 1899 to 1903. In 1909, Besley claimed \\"he was born in Australia of Kentucky parents and counts himself an American by descent\\". In the newspaper article, Besley commented on former President Teddy Roosevelt's trip to Nairobi, British East Africa. Besley said the public \\"need not fear or tremble for his (Roosevelt's) safety so far as the wild beasts are concerned\\". Besley said he had \\"been all over that section\\" killing \\"many lions and other beasts\\". In February 1912, a newspaper described Besley as being \\"the most noble Roman of them all.\\" In June 1912 Besley claimed in an interview with the San Francisco Examiner he had wounded Mexican \\"General\\" Jos√© Gil in a duel at Navojoa, Sonora, Mexico and that Gil would soon die from lead poisoning due to the bullets Besley had fired into Gil's body. Six months later, the San Francisco Examiner reported \\"the General was killed by Besley\\" during the duel. There are no contemporaneous records of Besley's claimed duel. Instead, Jos√© Goycolea Gil lived and served as President of Navojoa, Mexico in 1925. In 1948, Besley said he had been \\"born on an immense British Government land grant near Adelaide in the southern part of Australia\\". He claimed he had come \\"to the United States around 1900, passed through Arizona and went on to Old Mexico, where he purchased several ranches, including the San Carlos outfit\\". Fictitious Australian gold rush history Besley claimed he had joined the rush to the gold fields of Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie in Western Australia and had been successful in finding gold. In 1894, Besley had instead applied for an Australian mining homestead lease on 4,154 acres of potential mining land and was refused. He lost two subsequent appeals for the mining lease. His brother B. C. Besley managed the Conrad Stannite Mines, Ltd., located at Borah Creek, New South Wales, Australia and founded the Broken Hill Polo Club in Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia. B. C. Besley's horse \\"Fly\\" won the club's first Cup match. Fictitious military service histories Besley often falsely referred to himself as \\"Captain\\" Besley and \\"Colonel\\" Besley. He neither earned nor held an actual military rank, nor did he serve in any military capacity. Besley claimed he served in the Boer War, having been personally commissioned by Lord Kitchener to organize the \\"Boer Scouts\\" while he was surveying South Africa for Prime Minister Cecil Rhodes. Besley also claimed he was commissioned a Major during that war, and was placed at the head of the Carbineers. He said when the Boer War ended in 1902, he voluntarily discarded the title of \\"Major\\". There are no records of a \\"James Campbell Besley\\" serving in the Boer War. In a February 1913 news article, Besley's wife reported his claims of Captaincy and of serving in the Boer War were false. She said \\"from the time they met in 1898 till their marriage he was either in Alaska or California as she was corresponding with him all that time\\". These facts have been ignored by the press and researchers for decades as they continue to report Besley's purported exploits. A September 1913 newspaper article said Besley \\"was one of the Irregular Horse (the South African Mounted Irregular Force militia)... before the siege of Mafeking\\" and further claimed Besley had served with Kitchener's Scouts, the Imperial Light Horse (Regiment) and had \\"seen service\\" in Borneo and Australia. In 1914, Besley said in an interview \\"though he is a Britisher and has seen service under the British fiag, he is not an officer in the regular army\\". He said he instead held \\"a Captain's commission in the Rhodesia Light Horse, in which corps he fought during the Boer War\\". There are no records of a \\"James Campbell Besley\\" serving in the Rhodesian army. In 1919, Besley claimed to be a Lieutenant Colonel \\"from London, England\\". It was reported \\"When England entered the Great War, Colonel Besley, then a captain, joined the English colors. He soon was in the middle of things, got wounded, promoted and honorably discharged\\". In 1924, \\"Captain\\" Besley visited a Brisbane, Australia newspaper claiming he was a veteran Captain of the 7th Infantry Battalion of the British Columbia Regiment of the Canadian Army. He said he and his traveling partner were attempting an around the world bicycle tour, both hoping to win a ¬£1,000 prize. There are no records of a \\"James Campbell Besley\\" serving in the Canadian army. During the interview, Besley claimed he had been born at Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, South Africa. By the 1930s, Besley was often referring to himself as \\"Colonel\\" J. Campbell Besley. In 1938 it was reported that \\"Colonel\\" Besley was \\"a retired British Army officer and a veteran polo player\\" who had played polo \\"many years in India while on duty there with the British Army\\". Arrival in America Besley is first mentioned in the US press as staying at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, California on April 9, 1898. Besley listed his address as \\"City\\". Alaskan embezzlement, forgeries, arrests and trial Embezzlement and arrest An 1898 North British American advertisement listing J C Besley as Traffic Manager of the companyBesley's brother Brian Charles Besley invested in the North British American Trading and Transportation Company, founded by Pat Galvin, a former Helena, Montana Chief of Police and one of the first millionaires in the Klondike gold rush. Capitalized at $3,500,000 (), the company was organized to provide transportation and trade to the Alaskan gold rush and enjoyed virtually unlimited credit on the Bank of England. Besley was hired by the company as accountant and traffic manager. A local newspaper named Besley one of Galvin's \\"false friends\\" who had caused Galvin \\"considerable losses\\". In 1899 it was reported Besley had spent $40,000 () of Galvin's money in Dawson City, Yukon, Alaska Territory providing food for a woman named \\"Lucille\\". Later, Galvin had to settle a claim made by Dawson Caf√© Royal restaurant owner Jack Timmons for Besley's having ordered $1,435.00 () for \\"female friends\\". The headquarters of the Trading & Exploring Co., Dawson City, Yukon, Alaska Territory, 1899Galvin's North British American Trading and Transportation Co. went bankrupt and was succeeded by the Trading & Exploration Co., chartered in London, England in 1899. The Trading & Exploration Co. invested power of attorney in William White and sent him from London to investigate the company's finances in Dawson City. White reported \\"I called on the general manager, James Besley, and arranged to discuss business matters with him next day. I found him settled over the warehouse with his living quarters there, a Chinese cook and a very comfortable apartment... That evening I dined with Besley and we had a talk about the company's affairs, covering the mining and commercial business, over all of which he appeared to have had control. The following day we got down to serious work, and it wasn't long before I ascertained that it was impossible to make much headway, as the books, vouchers, etc., had all been destroyed by fire, said to have been of 'an accidental nature'. He (Besley) had a set of books showing only transactions since the date of the fire. I remarked that there was no sign of fire in the office and wondered how the books could have been burned, but he could throw no light on it. After further investigation I came to the conclusion that Besley himself had made away with the books, etc., in order to cover up evidence of his guilt as the one who had destroyed the company's property and robbed it of its assets... I was obliged next day to have a warrant issued for his arrest on a charge of embezzlement.\\" White further said of Besley \\"(he) was an Australian; tall, handsome and of an all-round \\"hail fellow, well met\\" type. In the dance halls he was called 'The Prince' on account of his generosity to the girls, and was usually found of an evening in a private box, surrounded by them, drinking champagne. His tastes in this and other ways were of the most expensive kind, the poor old company always putting up the money.\\" Besley was finally indicted on two charges brought by J. B. Wood, manager of the Trading & Exploration Co. and Charles W. Thebo, manager of Galvin's meat syndicate. Besley was arrested, skipped a $10,000 bail and left for San Francisco. At the time, it was predicted he would not be taken back and stand for trial. Federal forgeries In 1901, Besley was a member of the firm \\"Burns & Besley\\", based in Cape Nome and St. Michael, Alaska, which \\"held a contract from the Government for the erection of a telegraph line from Dawson down the Yukon River\\". Two US Treasury Department checks totaling $7,600 () had been drawn on the US Army Signal Corps office account in St. Michael, Alaska and had apparently been signed by Captain Frank Green. The checks had been endorsed \\"Burns & Besley per J. C. Besley, Member of the Firm\\" and the checks were paid by the Bank of Nome (Alaska) at the end of August 31, 1901 business day, the date of Besley's marriage. Three days later, the cashier at the bank wired the First National Bank of Seattle and stopped payment on the first $3,800 check. That same day, a second check endorsed \\"Burns & Besley per J. C. Besley, Member of the Firm\\" for another $3,800 was presented to the First National Bank of Seattle, who refused to honor the second check. Captain Green later advised the bank that two checks had been stolen from the Signal Corps office. The numbers of the stolen checks matched the two checks that had been presented to and paid by the Bank of Nome. International manhunt and arrest In 1903, Besley was indicted on six separate criminal charges in the US District Court, Second Division in Nome. Besley was found by Seattle, Washington Secret Service agent Charles E. Herron and Deputy US Marshal Daniel R. Dwyer. Their manhunt for Besley started after the special agents had first delivered William A. Wilson to Manila, Philippines. They had apprehended Wilson in Alaska on federal charges of embezzlement. Herron and Dwyer then traveled over 17,000 miles searching for Besley. Their search took them from the Alaskan Territory to the United States, Manila, Japan, China, Melbourne (Australia), Tasmania (New Zealand) and then to South Africa where they found Besley. The manhunt took nearly two years. They discovered Besley helping a group of American investors develop mining properties 300 miles north of Pretoria, South Africa. Besley was arrested in Johannesburg, South Africa by Herron and Dwyer \\"on charges of forging United States Army paymaster's checks\\" in Alaska. Described as being \\"of fine appearance and gentlemanly in bearing\\", Besley \\"made no protest at having to leave his business and return to the United States, but insisted that the whole matter was a mistake, which he was as anxious as anyone else to have the matter cleared up.\\" It was reported that the arresting officers allowed Besley to \\"close out his financial interests\\" in South Africa and \\"for one gold mine he received $75,000 () in cash\\". Back to Alaska for trial Besley was transported to Southampton, England. On July 11 they sailed to New York city aboard the American Line steamer St. Paul. Treated by the arresting officers \\"as a companion\\" on the trip, passengers thought the three men \\"were prosperous American business men returning from abroad\\". Traveling \\"completely unembarrassed\\" and enjoying a trip from England to America \\"paid for by Uncle Sam\\", Besley charmed his fellow passengers, \\"traveling in style, hobnobbing with young ladies, rich widows\\", US Deputy Surveyor of Customs Col. John M. Bishop, actress Julia Marlowe and Senator Frederick Hale of Maine. Hale caused a sensation on the trip by mixing and serving a cocktail he claimed he had created to Besley and others, the \\"ginger ale jounce\\". Maine at the time had not abandoned prohibition. After arriving in New York, Besley was taken to Washington, D.C. and held in custody at the National Hotel while Herron and Dwyer's expense accounts, said to be \\"several thousands of dollars\\", were audited and paid. Besley was sent to Seattle, Washington, arriving on July 29. Besley's estranged wife, Marjorie Bennett Besley traveled from San Francisco, met him in Seattle and provided funds for his defense. Besley was sent on \\"the first steamer for Cape Nome\\" to stand trial on all charges, including forgery. Besley's wife traveled to Monte Carlo and waited there in seclusion for the verdict. Trial and acquittal Having become a Major, former Captain Frank Greene of the US Signal Corps traveled from Manila to Juneau to serve as a witness in Besley's forgery trial. Besley was acquitted on the first charge. US Treasury Cashier Thomas Burns recommended dropping all other charges, saying \\"Besley was too popular to be convicted as the people believe he is the victim of persecution.\\" The Court then upheld a motion made by Besley's attorney to drop all charges against him because the Alaskan court had moved the trial venue from Nome to Juneau, a jurisdictional overreach that denied Besley a trial judged by his local peers. The ruling read in part \\"the motion of the defendant to dismiss the present indictment, on the ground that the grand jury was without jurisdiction to inquire of the offense alleged to have heen committed at or near Nome in the second division, must be sustained, and it is so ordered.\\" Besley was acquitted of all charges on May 17, 1903, causing a celebration in Juneau. In December 1903, U. B. Solner, former cashier of the Bank of Cape Nome and a witness in the Besley forgery trial said the \\"evidence is stronger than ever against Besley\\" and that \\"a jury cannot be secured in Alaska to convict a man of a crime against the government\\". Fictitious claims of second Alaskan trial In January 1913, newspaper articles appeared in the Seattle Times and Alaskan newspapers claiming \\"Gentleman Jim\\" Besley had been sued for fraud by George \\"Tex\\" Rickard. The articles claimed Besley had persuaded Rickard to pay Besley's bail before his 1903 Alaskan embezzlement trial had started. The news articles reported Rickard paid Besley's bail in exchange for \\"a lot of phony mining property in Nome\\" as well as \\"certain interests in\\" South African \\"mining property\\" held by Besley. The articles falsely related how Besley had once again fled Alaska for Africa, how he had been found by Rickard and made to return to Alaska and stand trial. The articles claimed Besley had been acquitted for a second time. It was also falsely reported \\"Rickard is still out the money which he claims to have lost on his mining deal.\\". There are no records of Besley fleeing Nome the second time nor are there records of a 1913 \\"Rickard vs. Besley\\" trial within the Alaskan state archives. Bigamy and broken betrothal After a courtship during the summer of 1912, Besley proposed marriage to Elizabeth Modini Wood, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Modini Wood. Wood was named \\"one of the most attractive and probably one of the richest debutantes\\" in Los Angeles, California. It was reported Wood and her sister Florence had inherited $ 40,000,000 () from their grandfather William H. Perry, a Los Angeles lumber merchant and financier. The family hired the local Pinkerton detective agency office to investigate Besley. It was discovered that Besley was still married to Marjorie Bennett, whom he had met in 1898 while visiting San Francisco, California. While Besley was conducting business in Nome, Bennett, then 19 years old, traveled there and married Besley on August 31, 1901. They returned to San Francisco. Thirteen days after their marriage, Besley told his wife he had to leave for business and \\"that he was going away and not coming back\\". She did not hear from him for nearly two years. Urged by her parents, she sought a divorce from Besley. She received an interlocutory decree of divorce on June 6, 1903, but did not obtain a final decree. A newspaper article said \\"...Marjorie Besley is as much Besley's wife as on the day they were married\\". Confronted with the certainty of being accused of bigamy if he married Wood, Besley withdrew his proposal in early February, 1913. Then he vanished. \\"Leaving behind his polo sticks and guns and a lot of puzzled friends wondering at his troubles with his first wife, Captain J. Campbell Besley has disappeared. Efforts of friends today to find him were fruitless. It is thought he has gone to Mexico, where he has been in the habit of making business trips.\\" Mining activities Walter Holt, Elgin Holt, James Campbell Besley at Wells Fargo office, Estacion Llano, Sonora, MexicoIn 1900, Besley was in Seattle, Washington acting as a representative of an Australian mining syndicate. He negotiated the purchase of eight Alaskan placer claims on Eldorado Creek in the Bonanza gold district near Nome from owner J. D. Morgan. Besley paid a $2,000 deposit on a total purchase price of $40,000. In 1908, Besley sold the Noche Bueno mine, located near Soyopa, Sonora, Mexico to Charles P. Reinigar, an Ohio owner of mines throughout Mexico. Besley retained an interest in the mine. This became a point of contention and caused a subsequent lawsuit that Besley lost to Reiniger on appeal in 1914. In December, 1909, Besley sold the Cerro de Plata mine, located in Sonora, Mexico, 25 miles southwest of Nogales, for $40,000 () to a group of Kentucky investors who incorporated as The Cerro de Plata Mining Company with a capitalization of $ 1,000,000 (). After two years of disappointing results, the investors asked Besley to find a purchaser for the mine. Besley brokered a deal with Elgin Bryce Holt and his brother Walter Holt purchasing the 150 acre mine. A trade advertisement listing J. Campbell Besley as a Mining Engineer, Mining and Scientific Press, Volume 102, May 6, 1911.In 1911, Besley placed an ad in the Mining and Scientific Press trade journal, listing himself as a \\"Consulting Mining Engineer\\". He had no formal education in mine engineering. In 1952, Besley placed a classified ad in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Post-Gazette offering a \\"well prospected\\" tungsten property near the Mexican border. The ad said Besley required the \\"funds and machinery to mine and ship ore\\", mentioned \\"liberal interest given\\" and listed his address as Tucson, Arizona. Polo player 1913 Coronado Country Club polo team members (left to right) Lord Tweedmouth, Lord Alastair Innes-Ker, F. McLaughlin and James Campbell Besley.Besley was a horseman and a trophy winning polo player. Besley said he started playing polo at 13. He played on the Coronado (California) Country Club team when they won the Pacific Coast All-American trophy during the Pacific Coast Open in 1913. His teammates included Malcolm Stevenson, C. Perry Beadleston and Major Colin G. Ross, ‚Äúthe father of polo‚Äù at Coronado. Besley was described by Outing magazine as \\"a handsome fellow, his hair prematurely white. his face bronzed by adventures in many climes, Captain Besley was a striking figure on the Hillsborough polo fields. In playing polo, he affected an English helmet, giving him the outward appearance of a handsome cavalier. He had no ponies of his own, but that mattered little -- for Walter Dupee, the Chicago millionaire horseman, who makes his winter home at Coronado, is ever ready to supply his boon companions with spirited mounts from his string\\". In 1928, Besley played forward on the Sonora (Mexico) Tigers polo team. A newspaper article claimed Besley was \\"a former British polo star\\" and said he was \\"still a brilliant forward in spite of his 60 odd years. In every play of the Tigers, the tall, spare form of the Colonel is seen in the scrimmage, and his accurate mallet has been a strong weapon in the Sonoran's attack\\". In the 1930s, \\"Colonel\\" Besley introduced polo to the cowboys and guests of the Circle Z Ranch located in Patagonia, Arizona. Besley was a guest and the polo coach at the ranch \\"for several seasons\\". The Circle Z \\"Wranglers\\" polo team competed for four years, defeating teams from the University of Arizona (the \\"Wildcats\\"), US Army Fort Huachuca, the Santa Monica Riviera, the New Mexico Military Institute as well as the Nogales, Arizona \\"Cowboys\\". In 1938, it was reported \\"Colonel J. Campbell Besley, retired British officer, lay in critical condition\\" from a broken neck suffered in a polo match on January 9 between his team, the Nogales Internationals and the University of Arizona. Besley was thrown, landing on his stomach when his mount \\"stumbled and fell\\". His horse \\"turned a somersault and landed with his (the horse's) hips on the Colonel's neck and shoulders\\". Besley was carried from the field unconscious, having \\"suffered a neck fracture at the base of the skull\\". The Capt. Besley Motion Picture Company, Inc. In 1912, Paul Rainey's African Hunt, a silent film of an African safari led by explorer Paul J. Rainey grossed over a half-million dollars (), an extraordinary sum for an early motion picture. It was one of the most successful non-fiction films of the decade. Rainey's safari team included a photographer and a taxidermist from the Smithsonian Institution. The success of Rainey's films led to a boom in expedition and nature films. These were silent films, so many of these films were at first presented by a lecturer in a lyceum-like context. Besley incorporated \\"The Capt. Besley Motion Picture Company, Inc.\\" in New York on July 17, 1913 with Franklin B. Coates and F. Eugene Farnsworth. Besley, Farnsworth and Coates assembled an expedition team to produce a film similar to Rainey's in South America. Besley's filming expeditions First expedition to Peru and the Amazon 1913 first Besley Peruvian Expedition team photo - Front row, left to right: William Dunn, J. K. Holbrook; back row, left to right: Franklin B. Coates, James Campbell Besley(Left to right) James Campbell Besley, Franklin B. Coates, Arthur Galaid, J. W. Dunn, F. Eugene Farnsworth and John Knight Holbrook before their 1913 South American Expedition.Franklin B. Coates (left) and James Campbell Besley (right) rafting on the Upper Mara√±on River, the principal source of the Amazon River, on the first Besley South American Expedition in 1913.The Besley party set out on the film documentary expedition on July 19, 1913. The party of five sailed on the RMS Magdalena from New York harbor to Lima, Peru to explore \\"the dark and uninhabited parts of the continent\\". The expedition was said to be \\"financed by a British nobleman\\". Besley was detained at the last minute and said he would sail the next Saturday. The members of the expedition included film director Franklin B. Coates, who acted as manager; cinematographer John Knight Holbrook, and William Jerome Dunn, botanist. Besley acted as the expedition zoologist. Others were film producer F. Eugene Farnsworth of Boston and Graflex still photographer Arthur Maurice Galaid. George Shoup, an American mining engineer, and Reginald Leonard, an expert appointed by the Peruvian government to study the uta fly (Lutzomyia sand flies, the reservoir of the Leishmania parasites that cause Andean cutaneous leishmaniasis) joined the expedition in Peru and remained there after the Besley's tour ended. Director Coates said of Holbrook during the trip \\"I want to say that Holbrook is one of the bravest and gamest men I ever met. He did without hesitation and without question everything that was asked or required of him. He was in many extremely dangerous situations, but he never flinched\\". During the trip, a pack mule fell from a steep slope into a stream, severely damaging one of two Path√© motion picture cameras. 3,000 feet of film and a number of dry negative plates were lost. After returning to Lima, Besley and Coates journeyed to the \\"buried cities of the Incas\\" and decided to attempt a third trip to traverse the continent from the source of the Amazon River to its mouth through uncharted regions \\"from which no known white man had returned\\". It was claimed President Guillermo Enrique Billinghurst of Peru attempted to dissuade them. The group also met with H. Clay Howard, the US envoy to Peru. Besley, Coates, Dunn and Holbrook made the journey on horseback, foot, canoe and raft. Along the way, Dunn found what the team believed were the bones of missing American explorers Mirko Seljan and Patrick O'Higgins. The team gave the remains \\"an impressive Christian burial and erected a cross\\". Theft of first expedition film footage The team returned to New York on the Byron, a ship in the Lamport and Holt line on February 17, 1914. They brought with them 7,000 feet of film in \\"perfect\\" condition from the Amazon trip, intending to cut the film to 5,000 feet for presentation on the lecture circuit. Coates discovered that the footage shot on the two earlier legs of the trip, which had been shipped to New York city from Lima, Peru before the team explored the Amazon had been stolen. Coates said of the theft \\"...when the trunk was opened in the appraiser's otfice here it was discovered that all the films had been abstracted\\". Coates employed the Burns detective agency, offering a reward of $1,000 for \\"the return of the film and no questions asked\\". Coates said \\"if in thirty days he gets no returns from the circulars he is sending out he will start for Peru and retake all the locations he photographed before\\". Besley said he would arrange to meet Coates in Peru and take part in the expedition. Newspaper coverage of first expedition Besley's news coverage was both national and international. In newspaper interviews, Besley claimed natives continually threatened the expedition. \\"For 30 days they had to fight their way through cannibal tribes... several times the party feared starvation, its members living on nuts and cracked corn for days.\\" Besley was interviewed by the Belgian newspaper La M√©tropole in February 1914. The article mentioned \\"Captain Besley in an interview just gave the correspondents (of La M√©tropole) interesting information about his explorations in Peru...(During a trip) from Lima to July with help (Besley) arrived at Cuzco, the ancient capital of the Incas. He met an old Indian who took him to the ruins of three ancient Indian cities\\". The article mentioned Besley relating how he saw \\"blocks of stone weighing between 300 and 500 tons (with) close masonry and one wonders which engineers managed to build buildings with such materials.\\" Besley also claimed that \\"...most of the objects (we) found were of an alloy of gold and silver\\". This interview's content predated Besley's later interviews from the second expedition. Mining research during trip Besley took advantage of the trip to research mines and mining techniques along the course of the expedition. In early November, 1913 Besley's friend, Santa Cruz, California inventor () and mine operator Charles R. Bushnell met the expedition and inspected the mines at Cerro de Pasco, Peru. Cerro de Pasco is one of the world's richest silver producing areas after silver was discovered there in 1630. It is still an active mining center. Second expedition to Peru, Bolivia and Argentina Photograph of James Campbell Besley during 1914 Second Peruvian ExpeditionJames Campbell Besley (on left) with guide looking at Machu Picchu in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru during Besley's second South American expedition in 1914.Besley announced another expedition would commence in 1914 so the missing footage could be replaced. In April 1914, Besley, Coates and Holbrook returned to Peru to reshoot the lost footage. Arriving in Buenos Aires, Argentina they traveled on the Transandine Railway to Santiago, Chile. They crossed the Puente del Inca, a natural arch bridging the Las Cuevas River, a tributary of the Mendoza River located in Mendoza Province, Argentina. From there, Besley and his team crossed the Andes on foot, claiming to have made the journey in nine days. Besley claimed the team visited Lake Titicaca, on the border of Bolivia and Peru, \\"the highest navigable lake\\" in the world. During the expedition, Besley claimed to have found \\"the true source of the Amazon River\\", claiming the source to be a small spring in Peru \\"at the uppermost R√≠o Vilcanota‚ÄìUrubamba‚ÄìUcayali\\". In a July 1914 interview Besley said he had \\"vowed he would cross the mighty Andes on foot, and cross them he did, spite of the wiseacres who said that it meant certain death\\". In another interview, Besley said of the second expedition \\"We've got some good stuff, and we think some thrilling bits, too, as well as a mass of most informing and educational matters. We have got pictures of wild beasts and snakes, but try your best, you can't get your narrowest escapes on the film. If you knew when danger lurked, if your sun was shining and no trees intervened, and all the thousand and one essentials were in harmony it might be easier to put over the really big stuff. But come over anyway and see what we have to show you. I believe it is the best that has yet to be accomplished in the exploring and adventure line - yes, and educational too\\". Return ship rammed Besley and the expedition team returned to New York city on the United Fruit Company passenger and cargo steamer Metapan. At 15:20 on October 15, 1914, the outbound Iowan rammed the Metapan at the entrance of Ambrose Channel outside New York. The Metapan had stopped due to fog and had sounded three blasts on the ship's whistle warning the Iowan of the impending collision. The Iowan's captain did not alter his ship's course, but did drop her anchor to try and slow the fully laden ship. Nevertheless, the Iowan gashed the bow of the Metapan, traveling almost halfway through the passenger ship. The Metapan began to rapidly sink, becoming grounded in of water. Besley's scientific expedition had brought cargo from Peru including two Incan mummies, jewelry, pottery and other artifacts and motion picture film documenting the expedition. Besley's cargo was safely recovered from the ship. Claims of proof of prehistoric giants, skulls, mummies and voodoo Besley's second expedition film was claimed to include proof of \\"giant skeletons and lost cities built of massive stones that he (Besley) said would be impossible to build without modern machinery\\". It was reported that Besley had arrived in New York from his second expedition in South America, bringing a number of scientific treasures, including the skull of a human being \\"who must have been eight feet in height\\". Besley said of the skull \\"A tradition among the Indians of Peru and Boliva makes the ancient race a race of giants... This may be a legend which weighed between 100 and 200 tons. It might be that we stumbled upon an isolated giant who was as much a wonder when he lived as he would be today\\". Other curiosities of great interest were human skulls thought to be four or five thousand years old, on which trepanning operations had been performed. These were said to be found in Bolivia, in Inca ruins. The skulls were said to have been trepanned by sawing out a square, tilting metal through it and replacing that section, and had been found by excavators in Peru and Bolivia. Besley also claimed the second expedition brought back two \\"pre-Inca vases\\" and two human mummies, said to be \\"forty or fifty centuries old\\" that had been found \\"swathed in a sitting posture with the hands thrust under the jaws\\". Besley is quoted as having observed the widespread practice of voodoo on his South American expeditions. Spurious expedition claims In typical fashion, Besley embellished many aspects of both expeditions. During the second journey, Besley said the team ‚Äúrescued‚Äù Australian explorer William Carr, who they claimed was found unconscious by one of the team's dogs, \\"having been buried for twenty-four hours in a snow drift\\". Besley claimed \\"I got hold of his tongue, pulled it out, poured brandy down his throat, chafed his hands and feet, and gradually he opened his eyes.\\" Carr's surviving that long in freezing temperatures would have been impossible. In a 1914 interview about the first expedition, Besley said \\"there were eleven in the party, seven men having joined the four just for the experience of it... eight of our party of eleven fell ill with the fevers and seven of them lost all interest in the trip\\". In 1917, discussing the first expedition, Besley said \\"of the twelve white men who started, only four returned. Several fell victims of the poisoned arrows of the natives\\". Besley said in a 1918 article \\"shortly before our expedition started a force of 135 Peruvian soldiers were ambushed and massacred to a man... Unfortunately all our dogs sacrificed their lives to secure our safety, some being killed by jaguars but most by poisoned arrows\\". 1914 Besley expedition film Production and premiere 1915 newspaper advertisement for Capt. Besley's South American Pictures, Maxine Elliott's Theatre, New York CityAccording to a news story in November 1914, Besley planned to quickly edit the 16,000-18,000 feet of film they returned with so it would be ready for presentation in a New York theater. The film premiered at Maxine Elliott's Theatre on January 15, 1915. Assignment of rights to Besley Expedition media In 1914 and 1915, The Capt. Besley Motion Picture Company had a total of $1,097 () in attachments placed on its Manhattan, New York office for outstanding debts. In 1915, The Capt. Besley Motion Picture Company sold the \\"sole and exclusive right to produce for the entire world the moving picture films and still pictures taken by the Captain Besley Motion Picture Expedition in 1913 and 1914\\" to the Scenograph Feature Film Company, Inc. Scenograph had been acting as the distributor of the Besley film. Besley reserved the right to own \\"one positive print of the expedition film for his personal use in presentations\\" as well as any future compensation Besley might recover from the W. R. Grace company. Besley had filed against that company for having lost the motion picture and still film negatives he had shipped from Peru to New York during the 1913 expedition. Theft of 1914 expedition movie Percy A. McCord was Besley's expedition secretary and an author of magazine articles about Besley's second expedition. He also served as general manager of the Captain Besley Motion Picture Company. In 1914, McCord stole a copy of the second Besley expedition film from the Scenograph Film Company. McCord attempted to sell the film to other film distributors, saying he personally owned the rights to the Besley movies. McCord showed the film to cinematographer Robert J. Flaherty, who had created the early and acclaimed documentary Nanook of the North. McCord offered to sell Flaherty the distribution rights to the Besley film. Flaherty said \\"Mr. McCord is, distinctly, uneducated, Illiterate\\" and said the Besley film \\"has no artistic or literary merit above the merest newspaper 'copy'...\\" Flaherty's wife Frances' review of the film was \\"the photography was abominable, the subject matter entirely superficial...\\" McCord also used the stolen copy of the Besley expedition film in a Manhattan stock swindle. McCord was arrested on March 11, 1916, on a complaint filed by Louis Michaels. Michaels claimed to be an official of the Scenograph Film Company who owned the rights to the Besley films. Michaels was actually working for John B. G. Rinehart, a Manhattan attorney who had swindled an investor when he had McCord arrested. Besley film related stock swindle A newspaper advertisement excerpt for the Globe Co-operative Film Company, Ltd.In 1915, John B. G. Rinehart, a Manhattan attorney and Walter Content, an owner of a Manhattan stock brokerage, purchased stock in a shell company in Arizona, the \\"Globe Co-operative Film Company, Ltd.\\". Newspaper ads across America claimed the newly formed company had purchased the assets of the failed Blinkhorn Photoplay Company. Potential investors were urged to purchase stock. The newly formed company had no association with the Blinkhorn company. The New York State Supreme Court later determined the Globe Co-operative Film Company stock was \\"absolutely worthless\\". Joseph H. Cohen, a New York city resident, had recently inherited some $20,000 from his grandfather. Rinehart and Content's representatives told Cohen the Globe Co-operative Film Company \\"owned or controlled the Besley South American exploration movie\\". They claimed the value of the movie was \\"very great\\" and was \\"comparable... with the celebrated Rainey African hunt picture\\", telling Cohen \\"the Rainey movie had earned $1,000,000\\" (). Percy A. McCord, secretary of the Capt. Besley Motion Picture Company had stolen a copy of the Besley film in 1914 and was attempting to sell it to film distributors. When McCord had heard about the $12,000 stock sale by Rinehart to Cohen from a detective hired by Cohen, \\"he demanded (of the detective) to know the name of the man who thought so highly of the pictures as to invest $ 13,000 in the stock of a company that supposedly owned them\\". Rinehart told McCord Cohen's name, asked McCord not to contact Cohen, and to let Rinehart's associates handle the negotiations. Rinehart wrote McCord a $100 check to screen the stolen copy of the film for Cohen during the stock purchase negotiations. The cancelled check endorsed by McCord was entered as evidence in the lawsuit. Rinehart offered Cohen $10 per share stock at a reduced rate of $6 per share. Cohen was told the stock was at that time unlisted but would \\"soon be listed upon the curb (over the counter)\\". Cohen was further told if he purchased the stock, the brokerage would recommend it to their clients, and Cohen could within a short time easily sell the stock for $12 to $13 per share. Cohen was also told that then Massachusetts Governor Eugene Foss was interested in investing in the movie. Cohen invested $13,000 in April, 1915, but quickly learned the stock was worthless and sued for a refund. Cohen won his case on appeal and was awarded $15,400, refunding his investment and court costs. The Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court said in its decree \\"The company (Globe Co-operative) was a mere paper corporation, it neither controlled nor had any option on the picture it exhibited to the plaintiff, and in fact the whole transaction was a very common swindle.\\". Expedition lecture tours A 1917 James Campbell Besley lecture advertisement from London Evening NewsBesley toured the globe presenting lectures, showing photographs and the film from the 1914 expedition while recounting both expeditions. In typical fashion, Besley started exaggerating the facts of both trips in order to attract audiences. Spurious claims of expedition deaths By 1917, Besley claimed the expedition was a success \\"but at considerable cost of life, for of the twelve white men who started, only four returned\\". None of Besley's party died on either trip. In February, 1914, a newspaper article recounted how Besley asked the expedition who among them wanted to push ahead to the Amazon and who wanted to return to New York. According to the article, \\"seven men said they wanted to go back, and they did...\\" Besley's list of expedition members who had died frequently changed, from one interview to another. For instance, Besley often claimed film producer F. Eugene Farnsworth died on the journey in 1914. Farnsworth actually died in 1926 after having become the \\"King Kleagle\\" of the Ku Klux Klan in Maine. Belsey often claimed Graflex still photographer Arthur Galaid died during the trip, but he accompanied the team during the entire first expedition in 1913. Galaid was a published Newspaper Enterprise Association photographer in the 1920s. Besley often claimed another expedition member, gold and silver mine owner George Shoup died from a bite on his leg \\"by some venomous insect or reptile\\". Besley said after Shoup's leg \\"commenced to swell and turn blue\\", Shoup had died \\"a couple of days out from Calleo, Peru on an emergency trip home. Shoup actually died in San Francisco in 1918, an apparent suicide. Shoup was a cousin of the California Southern Pacific Railroad magnate Paul Shoup. On January 16, 1928, Besley gave a lecture to the monthly meeting of the Archeological and Historical society at the University of Arizona about his 1914 trip to the Amazon. He claimed \\"12 scientists and 60 porters\\" traveled on the expedition with him. The lecture included stories of a battle with natives \\"in which several of his men were killed\\". Besley claimed \\"he lost a score (twenty or so) or more in all of men to the Indians and the rapids\\". Royal Geographical Society, British Royalty lectures A photo of James Campbell Besley, circa 1917. Photographer, Campbell Studios, 538 Fifth Avenue, New York (Photographer).On January 11, 1917, Besley presented a lecture to the Royal Geographical Society at the Burlington Gardens in London. A review published in the RGS' The Geographical Journal described the presentation as \\"a magnificent series of pictures illustrating his recent journey from the Peruvian coast over the Cordillera of the Andes and down into the Amazon forests... in a continuous series of pictures lasting two hours Mr. Besley showed the incidents of the voyage, the journey from Mollendo to Cuzco and Lake Titicaca; the principal Inca buildings, the descent of the eastern face of the Cordillera to the headwaters of the Apurimac and thence into the Amazonian forests, concluding with some especially fine pictures of the animal and reptile life. It is impracticable to describe in a brief space the incidents of the journey, which included many breathless descents of rapids on frail rafts. The procession of forest scenery as seen from the raft was of extraordinary beauty and interest. It is much to be hoped that those who had not the good fortune to be present at the meeting will have a further chance of seeing these pictures, many of which are of great geographical interest and educational value.\\" On February 17, 1917, Besley presented his film The Amazon River and the Unexplored South America with the Besley Expedition to King George V and Queen Mary of Teck of Great Britain, Princess Mary and Field-Marshall the Duke of Connaught during a tea held for a number of officers in the British Overseas Expeditionary Forces at Buckingham Palace, London, England. It was reported to be \\"the first of a series of weekly entertainments for overseas soldiers arranged by Their Majesties the King and Queen.\\" On March 22, 1917, Besley gave his first \\"cinematograph lecture\\" to the British public at the Duchess of Rutland's matinee at the Philharmonic Hall in London. Proceeds were to be given to \\"war charities\\". Good luck mascot promotion 1917 newspaper article explaining how to order the Besley Pre-Inca Good Luck MascotFor a number of years Besley offered for sale replicas of his \\"good luck mascot‚Äù (charm) to newspaper readers in Europe and Canada, often claiming the proceeds would benefit various local charities. Described as a \\"5,000 year old, small, pre-Inca idol, embossed on one side with the figure of a woman and on the other with that of a man\\", the mascot was advertised as having been given to the \\"Captain\\" many years ago in Peru by an old Indian woman, whose life he had saved. The woman assured Besley the amulet would \\"protect him from violent death\\". Payments for the amulet were to be sent to different apartment addresses in downtown London, England. Besley attributed \\"his numerous escapes from death during his explorations in East Africa, the Arctic Circle, and through the primeval forests of unexplored South America\\", which were \\"inhabited by hostile Indians with poisoned arrow\\" to his possession of the mascot. The advertisement described the life saving qualities of the amulet, saying \\"Captain Besley was through the South African War; and at the outbreak of the Mexican Rebellion a few years ago, at the request of President Diaz raised and led a force of 2,000 Yaqui Indians, which kept the field for five months, but was eventually compelled to disband in consequence of lack of ammunition and provisions\\" and that \\"his ranch in Mexico was looted by rebels and 30,900 head of cattle and 4,000 horses and mules (were) swept away\\". There are no contemporaneous newspaper articles that prove these claims. In Great Britain, purchasers were asked to send ¬£1 to the \\"Mascot Day Fund for Private Hospitals\\" in order to receive a replica of Besley's mascot and be entered into a drawing for the \\"original\\" mascot. Besley insisted that regardless of having been won in the final drawing, the original amulet \\"shall be lent (back) to him (Besley) when the time for his next exploration comes round\\". The same replica mascot was offered to readers of Welsh newspapers at a lower cost of 2 shillings with no additional offer. In Belgium, readers of L'Ind√©pendance Belge were told \\"each buyer (of a replica mascot) will receive entitlement to a raffle ticket whose major prizes will be an automobile and a piano\\" if purchased for one guinea (one pound and one shilling) before July 17. After July 17, the cost of a replica mascot fell to half a guinea. A year later, Besley said he was ‚Äúgetting a replica made‚Äù of the amulet that the actress Lily Elsie would sell at the 1918 bazaar held at London‚Äôs Albert Hall on behalf of Lady Paget's Blinded Soldier‚Äôs fund. Cotton crop experiments in Mexico In 1920, \\"Colonel\\" Besley experimented with a trial crop of short and long-staple cotton at \\"his plantation\\", the San Carlos Ranch, 33 miles south of Hermosillo, Mexico. Besley had partnered with Dr. John Burton, a Hermosillo physician and surgeon. Together they claimed they had planted 1,000 test acres of cotton. Besley reported the crops were \\"growing well\\", that he expected \\"a big acreage will be planted next year\\" and predicted \\"Sonora, Mexico will be one of the greatest cotton growing districts of the Americas\\". Australian bicycle tour A photo of James Campbell Besley (left) and Percy Skeyhill (right) on their World Bicycle Tour in Brisbane, AustraliaIn 1924, Besley visited a Brisbane, Australia newspaper claiming he was a veteran of the 7th Infantry Battalion of the British Columbia Regiment of the Canadian Army. He said he and his traveling partner Percy Skeyhill were attempting an around the world bicycle tour, both hoping to win a ¬£1,000 prize. Besley told a reporter at the Brisbane Telegraph newspaper the bicyclists could earn the reward if they \\"circled every country in the world and visited all important towns\\". One condition of the contest was \\"they must neither work, beg, borrow, steal nor sell anything other than a small pamphlet describing the object of the tour\\". Besley claimed he had been born at Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, South Africa and was \\"well known in Zululand, because of his several exploring expeditions into the heart of Africa\\". Besley's fanciful story included an account of how the two travelers had run out of water on the Nullarbor Plain on the Great Australian Bight coast. In order to learn where water could be found, Besley claimed he seized an Indigenous Australian, tied him to Besley's bicycle, and \\"there he was compelled to drag along after him, of which he soon tired, and leaving the main track led the way to water\\". Besley said the two planned to finish their tour in seven years, reaching Montreal, Canada in 1931. Mexican rubber plantation In 1926, Besley advertised in mid-western newspapers asking investors to assist him in working a 100,000 acre rubber plantation in Sonora, Mexico. The advertisements claimed \\"great quantities of native rubber near railroad\\", said a \\"small amount (investment) needed\\" and promised \\"quick returns\\". Sonora, Mexico uprising In 1929, \\"Colonel\\" Besley was asked by his friend and fellow polo enthusiast W. Beckford Kibbey to assist in standing against the threat of revolutionary insurgents at Rancho El Alamo, Kibbey's 60,000 acre ranch in Sonora, Mexico. Kibbey had earned a fortune cattle ranching and in the mines near Cananea in Sonora. Rancho El Alamo was described as a \\"castle-like fortress\\" built to protect Kibbey's family from \\"roaming bandits\\". Kibbey converted his house into a small fortress preparing against the rebel army commanded by General Jos√© Topete and his brother Fausto Topete, the Governor of Sonora. Besley stayed for 17 days, helping Kibbey with the planning and management of the defense of the property and ranch. The insurgency collapsed. The US government sent reinforcements into Sonora to support the Mexican federalists and the expected attack never happened. Arizona ranch and Riding Academy Coronel Besley Riding Academy advertisement from El Tucsonense, 1944-12-22A classified ad for Colonel Besley's Arizona Riding Academy; Tucson Daily Citizen, November 21, 1950In the 1940s and 1950s, Besley owned the Arizona Riding Academy and Stables in Tucson, Arizona. Besley had been referring to himself as \\"Colonel\\" Besley since the 1930s. The first advertisement was placed in the El Tusconense newspaper. Translated to English, the copy reads \\"The best saddle horses, meek, dependable. Mounted English and Western style. Experienced Guides\\". Death and burial Besley died on February 6, 1954. He had been living at the St. George Hotel in St. Kilda, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. His funeral services were held at Tobin's Chapel in Melbourne and his body was buried there in the Springvale Botanical Cemetery on March 1, 1954.

It contains a single species, M. intrepidus. Moros represents the earliest known diagnostic tyrannosauroid material from the Cretaceous of North America by a margin of about 15 million years. Discovery and naming Right femur in various views Moros was first discovered at the Stormy Theropod site located in Emery County in the U.S. state of Utah. Palaeontologists had been researching the area for ten years when in 2013 limb bones were seen jutting out of a hillside by Lindsay Zanno, prompting the excavation. The bones were described as a new species in February, 2019. In 2019, the type species Moros intrepidus was named and described by Lindsay E. Zanno, Ryan T. Tucker, Aurore Canoville, Haviv M. Avrahami, Terry A. Gates and Peter J. Makovicky. The generic name is derived from the Greek Moros (an embodiment of impending doom), in reference to the establishment of the tyrannosauroid lineage in North America. The specific name is the Latin word intrepidus (\\"intrepid\\"), referring to the hypothesized dispersal of tyrannosauroids throughout North America following Moros. The holotype, NCSM 33392, was found in the lower Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation dating from the Cenomanian. The layer has a maximimum age of 96.4 million years. The holotype consists of a right hindlimb. It contains the thighbone, the shinbone, the second and fourth metatarsal and the third and fourth phalanx of the fourth toe. LAGs (Lines of arrested growth) indicate that it represents a subadult individual of six or seven years old, nearing its maximum size. Additionally, two premaxillary teeth were referred to the species, specimens NCSM 33393 and NCSM 33276. Description average human Moros was a small-bodied, cursorial tyrannosauroid with an estimated weight of about . The foot bones of Moros were extremely slender, with metatarsal proportions found to be more similar to ornithomimids than to other Late Cretaceous tyrannosauroids. Classification In their phylogenetic analyses, Zanno and colleagues in 2019 recovered Moros as a basal pantyrannosaurian alongside Asian taxa from the middle of the Cretaceous such as Xiongguanlong and Timurlengia. This phylogenetic affinity with Asian basal tyrannosauroids suggests that Moros was part of a transcontinental exchange between the biotas of Asia and North America during the mid-Cretaceous that is well-documented in other taxa.

Overview  Neuromuscular junction (closer view) 1\\\\. presynaptic terminal 2\\\\. sarcolemma 3\\\\. synaptic vesicles 4\\\\. Acetylcholine receptors 5\\\\. mitochondrion In order to transduce an excitatory signal to the muscle, an indication must transduce from the presynaptic neuron's axon terminal, travel across the synaptic cleft and be received correctly in the post synaptic muscle tissue's motor end plate to produce the desired effect, at the right intensity. The signal that leaves the presynaptic neuron is in the form of Acetylcholine (Ach), a molecule that is released from stored vesicles at the terminal end of the neuron. Ach travels across the space of the synaptic cleft, to an Ach receptors on the sarcolemma of the motor end plate. shortly following its effect, the ach is being degraded by the enzymatic acetylcholinesterase. The Ach receptor is a ligand gated channel that once bound to Ach, goes through a conformational change that allows the flow of calcium, sodium, and potassium down their respective gradient. In large enough ion change an electrochemical potential will form, which is called an endplate potential (EPP). The EPP signal will be propagated through the motor end plate and to the T-tubules to affect the muscle filaments via sodium channels. These sodium channels have a brief activation window, after which they are inactivated until the end plate potential is restored to baseline levels.  Responses to tetany in muscle tissue   Without neuromuscular blocking agent  Tetany in evoked stimulus, as defined in Morgan & Mikhail's Clinical Anesthesiology as a ~5 seconds of sustained stimulus of between 50 and a 100 Hz. The reaction of muscle tissue to stimulus under no neuromuscular blockade should be equal in intensity throughout the stimulus, The first muscle twitch and last should be of roughly equal magnitude. Clinically it will present as equal muscle contraction throughout the duration of muscle stimulation.  Under non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent  Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (ie Rocuronium, Vecuronium) interact with Ach receptor without activating the channel, as well as preventing the binding of acetylcholine to it. This blocks the signal propagation from the presynaptic neuron, and the severs the transduction of the excitatory signal from the synaptic cleft. Tetanic Fade in Response to Evoked Electrical Stimulus in muscle Under a Non-Depolarizing Neuromuscular Blocking Agent or Under Phase 2 Block. Muscle tissue treated with a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents will an produce an indicative response in the form of a tetanic fade, a diminishing response to tetanic stimulation where the initial intensity will be the highest, and the following ones will show lower and lower strength of response. A some data suggest that this response is due to effect of non- depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents on the presynaptic nerve, leading to lower acetylcholine secreted to the cleft during the tetanic stimulation. In normal muscle tissue release of Ach works to stimulate more release of Ach from the presynaptic neuron's axon in a positive feedback manner, in tissue under a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent greatly diminished the levels of Ach that are released into the synaptic cleft.  Under depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent  Response of Muscle Tissue to Evoked Tetanic Stimulation Under Phase 1 Block Demonstrate Diminished Response. Depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (ie Succinylcholine) employ their effect by binding to the ach receptor and activating it, unlike acetylcholine though, the drug is not rapidly degraded by acetylcholinesterase. Succinylcholine propagates in high concentration for longer duration until it is degraded in the plasma and liver by a different enzyme (pseudocholinesterase). This continues to activate the Ach receptor, and prevents sodium channels from recovering to their active state. This leads to muscle relaxation and termed phase 1 block, clinically it will present as a diminished twitch response during tetanic stimulation. Phase 1 block does not show fade under tetanic stimulation. With further administration of depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, an effect that is similar to the response of muscle to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents can be observed. This response, termed phase 2 block, will demonstrate similar fade under tetanic stimulation, a diminishing response to tetanic stimulation where the initial response will be the strongest, and will produce lower and lower response intensity.

Alesha, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, was three days into a stay with her grandparents on the Isle of Bute when Campbell entered their unlocked home at approximately 02:00. The teenager had previously bought cannabis from Alesha's father Robert, who lived in the house, and initially went to steal the drug. Upon finding the child asleep, Campbell picked her up, carried her to an abandoned hotel, then raped and killed her by applying pressure to her face and neck. Alesha was reported missing at 06:23, and her body was discovered by a member of the public at 08:54. Police Scotland charged Campbell with abduction, rape and murder on 5 July 2018. The teenager denied any involvement, and pleaded \\"not guilty\\" when his trial began on 11 February 2019. He logged a \\"special defence of incrimination\\" by claiming that Robert MacPhail's girlfriend, Toni McLachlan, was responsible for murdering the child and framing him. Campbell was tied to the crime by CCTV footage, DNA, and fibres from his clothing, and the jury returned a guilty verdict after three hours of deliberation. A ban on publicly naming Campbell was lifted following his conviction. On 21 March 2019, he was handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 27 years; subsequently reduced to 24 years on appeal. He confessed to the crime before his sentencing, adding that he was \\"quite satisfied with the murder.\\" The case generated a large amount of media interest in the United Kingdom, with the presiding judge Lord Matthews stating that he \\"could not think of a crime in recent times that has attracted such revulsion\\". The perceived safety of the Isle of Bute contributed to the public's shock, while the young age of the culprit prompted discussion and debate around the nature of underage murderers.

She lived in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, with her mother Georgina Lochrane (aged 23 in 2018) and her younger sister Courtney (aged 4 in 2018).

Alesha would visit her father and grandparents every other weekend. On 28 June 2018, at six years old, she joined her family in Rothesay for what was meant to be three weeks of the school summer break.

Two young men testified that they had received messages from the defendant but did not meet him that night. Campbell logged a \\"special defence of incrimination\\", in which he argued that Toni McLachlan was responsible for MacPhail's death.

Unlike the defendant, 18-year-old McLachlan was named in the media throughout the trial.

Campbell confirmed that he could bench press ; the prosecution argued that McLachlan, conversely, did not have the strength to carry Alesha from her house to the murder site. Verdict and confession The trial lasted nine days. The jury deliberated for three hours before giving a unanimous guilty verdict on 21 February. Lord Matthews described the evidence against Campbell as \\"overwhelming\\", and stated that the teenager had committed \\"some of the most wicked and evil crimes this court has ever heard of in decades of dealing with depravity\\". Campbell remained emotionless upon hearing his conviction.Alesha MacPhail murder: Boy, 16, found guilty, BBC News, 21 February 2019 A group of media outlets made a legal bid for the teenager to be publicly identified, arguing that this transparency was in the public interest. Following the trial, Lord Matthews agreed to reverse the naming restriction ‚Äì a first in Scottish history ‚Äì due to the \\"unique\\" nature of the case. Campbell re- appeared before Lord Matthews for his sentencing on 21 March. Reports prepared by Dr Gary Macpherson, a consultant forensic clinical psychologist and a social worker revealed that he had since confessed to the crime in detail.Aaron Campbell jailed for life for murder of Alesha MacPhail, The Guardian, 21 March 2019 Campbell told Dr Macpherson that he was \\"quite satisfied with the murder\\" and said it took \\"everything to stop laughing\\" during points of the trial.

Lord Matthews described the teenager as a \\"cold, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual ‚Ä¶ completely lacking in victim empathy‚Äù before handing him a life sentence with a minimum term of 27 years. The judge stated that this term would have been higher for an adult, but observed that \\"reintegration or rehabilitation are remote possibilities‚Äù, perhaps \\"impossible\\". He stressed that the claims against Toni McLachlan were a \\"travesty of the truth\\" and that the young woman was \\"completely innocent\\". Georgina Lochrane shouted abuse at Campbell as the hearing ended, and subsequently told the media, \\"A life sentence should be a life sentence. He should have no human rights and doesn‚Äôt deserve anything because he is inhuman.\\" Appeal On 10 September 2019, Campbell successfully appealed his sentence, reducing the minimum term from 27 years to 24 years; meaning he will be eligible to apply for parole when he is 40.Alesha MacPhail killer has sentence cut by three years, BBC News, 10 September 2019 Three judges ruled that the original sentence had been excessive for his age, but they did not dispute Lord Matthews' suggestion that the appellant may never be released.

Reaction and memorials MacPhail's murder received significant media attention in the United Kingdom: the presiding judge stated that he \\"could not think of a crime in recent times that has attracted such revulsion\\".

At the time of the trial he acknowledged the lasting shock within the community, adding that \\"nothing feels the same\\".Teenager guilty of murdering six-year-old Alesha MacPhail, The Guardian, 21 February 2019 The revelations of casual teenage drinking, sex, and drug use on the island were also a source of surprise; Libby Brooks of The Guardian wrote that the MacPhail trial revealed \\"the reality of life on Bute beyond the picture postcard\\", where the population is declining and deprivation growing. Local young people were offered counselling services to help them deal with the repercussions of the case. A debate around childhood influences arose once the culprit was confirmed to be 16-year-old Campbell. In an effort to make sense of the crime, public and media comments focussed on \\"[Campbell's] reported obsession with violent video games, in particular the Slender Man meme, lurid analysis of his YouTube posts and speculation that cannabis psychosis was linked to this and other killings.\\"Why was Alesha MacPhail killed?

For the final twenty years of his life he was head librarian at the Vienna University Library. Biography Johann Wilhelm Ridler was born at Leitmeritz (as Litomƒõ≈ôice was known before 1945), a small predominantly catholic town in northern Bohemia. Jacob Hilarius Ridler, his father, was a businessman who had served in the imperial army during the time of Maria Theresa, ending up as an officer. His mother came from the minority Protestant community. Johann Wilhelm was the youngest of his parents' children. Sources report that his love of literature was awakened not at the local Gymnasium (secondary school) which he attended, and where the quality of the teaching left much to be desired, but by Friedrich Klopstock's \\"Messias\\" (epic poem), which his parents used to read aloud to him at home. In 1987 he moved to Prague where he enrolled at the (then German speaking) Universitas Carolina (\\"Charles University\\"), embarking on a Philosophy degree course, and in the process making up for any residual deficiencies from his secondary school education. His teachers at Prague included the Jesuit-historian (and prominent freemason), Ignaz Cornova, the literary scholar (and pioneer of detective fiction, and another freemason) August Gottlieb Mei√üner and the theologian Karl Heinrich Seibt. These three stirred in Ridler an appetite for academic work and especially for historical research. He would continue a correspondence friendship with Cornova long after he had embarked on an independent teaching career of his own. In the meantime, he switched to the study of Jurisprudence in order to prepare himself for possible government service later on. He had already made a start on Natural Law and Church Law when, in 1791, his career changed direction. That year, through the mediations of his teachers at Prague, he took a position as a home tutor with a family in Vienna. His pedagogic duties left him with sufficient time to pursue his own education privately, now in the imperial capital. In 1795, still as a home tutor, he moved to another family: he now worked for the family of Baron Franz Wilhelm von Natorp (1729‚Äì1802), variously described as a pharmacist, a wholesale trader or a wealthy businessman. Von Natorp had a lucrative contract for providing pharmaceutical supplies to the Austrian military. Ridler was able to combine his household tutoring with his own studies, now at the University of Vienna, where he attended the classes given by Franz Hammer on classical literature. Through the mediation of Hammer he also obtained a sub- professorship at the university in \\"World and Austrian political history\\" (eine \\"Lehrkanzeln der Welt- und √∂sterreichischen Staatengeschichte\\"). This became a full university professorship in 1804. At around the same time the Jesuit and Greek scholar, Prof. Franz Alter, retired and almost immediately died. Ridler took over Alter's responsibility in respect of Diplomatics (the specialist study of historical documents) and Heraldry. His relative youth and slightly unusual career path to date were not well received by students who initially boycotted his classes, but Ridler stood his ground. One of the students, induced by a fee waiver, attended a lecture: the others soon followed, with no further signs of generalised displeasure. Vienna fell under French military occupation in November 1805. The invasion was unopposed and on this occasion brief: many Viennese seem to have viewed the French soldiers as much with bemused curiosity as with hostility. At the university Johann Wilhelm Ridler continued to deliver his lectures during these weeks. Despite awareness that his audiences now included French officers who, on account of their Alsatian provenance, understood every word, he did not hold back from including in his discourses patriotic sentiments, drawing attention to those aspects of the contemporary situation that displeased him. In 1807 Ridler accepted an appointment as educator to Archduke Franz Karl, the emperor's third son. His duties in reality also included tutoring Franz Karl's elder brother, the Archduke (and future emperor) Ferdinand and (very briefly) the Archduke Joseph (who died of yellow fever or small pox later that same year). In addition to the three archdukes, Ridler served as educator to their three sisters, the Archduchesses Marie Louise (who later married Napoleon Buonaparte), Leopoldina and Carolina. After two years he resigned his position as court educator when he was appointed a \\"Regierungsrathe\\" (loosely, \\"governing councillor\\" and to membership of the \\"Studien-Hofcommission\\" (loosely, \\"Education [court] commission\\"), on which he would serve for the next seven years. Then in 1814, following the death of Court-councillor Anton Spendou the previous year, Johann Wilhelm Ridler accepted an invitation to succeed him as head of the Vienna University Library. He was relatively young for such an appointment, and it was clear from the start that this was to be no sinecure. He reduced his teaching work at the university to a bare minimum. After nearly two decades of the French Revolutionary Wars there was an urgent need to make the library more relevant to the needs of scientists and scholars, and to make the already large and high grade book collection more usable. Under Ridler's direction the collection grew significantly - by approximately 30,000 volumes in 20 years, and there was a significant increase in the library's endowment income, amounting to an additional 2,000 gulden annually. The reading rooms were completely reconfigured in order to improve access to the books. The work accomplished is described in careful detail in the library archives for 1830, published on 12 February and edited by Ridler himself. Ridler's final years were blighted by serious illness, from which he eventually died, aged 62 in Vienna, which is where his body was buried.

He was killed by a group of four terrorists belonging to the Red Brigades; he was the first journalist ever to be killed during the Years of lead.La Stampa, 11 November 1997, p. 1  Biography  After having attended the Liceo Classico Massimo d'Azeglio, Carlo Casalegno graduated in literatureCarlo Marletti, Francesco Bullo Il Piemonte e Torino alla prova del terrorismo, Rubbettino editore, 2004, pag.123 at the University of Turin and then, from 1942 to 1943, he was a teacher at Palli high school of Casale Monferrato. He took part to the Italian Resistance by joining the Action Party and collaborating to its newspaper \\"Italia libera\\". During the Post War period, he kept writing for the magazine \\"Giustizia e Libert√†\\" which, in the meantime, had taken the place of \\"Italia Libera\\". From 1951 to 1954 he was the director of the magazine \\"Resistenza. Giustizia e Libert√†\\". In 1947 he started to work for the Turin newspaper La Stampa of which he became deputy director in 1968 turning into the only domestic policy editor besides the chief Arrigo Levi. From 1969 to 1977, in his weekly column titled as Il nostro Stato (\\"Our state\\"), he wrote a great number of articles about some topical issues such as divorce, the secularism of the State and in particular terrorism, always asking for precision and firmness in applying the ordinary laws already existing to fight the phenomenon and to avoid it to find support in the civil society. He completely rejected the idea of resorting to special kinds of laws to suppress the phenomenon, fearing that such an initiative could have caused an endless sequence of violence, producing as a consequence the loss of democratic freedom of the citizens. In 1976 the trial of the Brigate Rosse began, which saw among its main defendants Renato Curcio. This trial developed in an incredibly grievous atmosphere, which led up to the murder of the lawyer Fulvio Croce, who had taken the defence of Red Brigades' militants notwithstanding they had threatened whoever would have done that (one cannot go to trial in Italy without a lawyer), and which pursued with the withdrawal of the citizens who were meant to compose the popular jury. In this contest, Casalegno with his articles urged everyone not to hide in front of the terrorism, suggesting everyone to fulfil their role.  The ambush of Red Brigades  In 1977, on 16 November at 13.55, while he was going back to his house in Re Umberto avenue, 54 for lunch, Carlo Casalegno was victim of an ambush by a fireteam of the Turin Red Brigades' column composed of Raffaele Fiore, Patrizio Peci, Piero Panciarelli and Vincenzo Acella. It seems Red Brigades' militants had initially planned of kneecapping him but, then after a serie of postponements and a discussion between the members of the Turin column, it was decided to kill him mainly because of his latest articles, considered to be highly controversial towards the armed struggle.A. Grandi, L'ultimo brigatista, pp. 96‚Äì98. Red Brigades' militants had planned to shot the journalist in the lobby of the building; Raffaele Fiore was charged of shooting, covered by Piero Panciarelli, meanwhile Peci stayed to watch over the area equipped with a submachine gun, Acella was meant to drive the car ready for the withdrawal.V. Tessandori, Qui Brigate Rosse, p. 69. At the moment of Casalegno's arrival in the lobby, Panciarelli and Fiore got closer and Fiore called the journalist to make him turn and not to shoot him on the back; Casalegno turned and was immediately hit by four bullets in his face coming from Fiore's Nagant M1895, right after the Red Brigades' militants escaped, believing they had killed the journalist who instead, whilst having suffered incredibly serious injuries to the jaw and mouth, didn't die right away. Immediately rescued by his wife, Casalegno was recovered in major conditions with a destroyed face at Le Molinette hospital. In that difficult moment in Turin it was tried to organise manifestations of solidarity: the night after the ambush day (17 November), there was a popular manifestation of citizens against terrorism in Piazza San Carlo with the attendance of some thousands of people. Nevertheless, the ambush didn't seem to produce a great shook among the Fiat's craftsmen: only a few workers took part to the strike hold immediately after where, in addition, some craftsmen released to the journalists declarations about their indifference for Casalegno's faith.Giorgio Bocca, Noi terroristi, pp. 151‚Äì152. Nevertheless, a seeming improvement he died on 29 November 1977, after 13 days of agony. The funeral was hold the 1 December in the church of Crocetta neighbourhood. Between the distinguished participants Gianni Agnelli, the politicians Bettino Craxi and Giovanni Spadolini and the former minister Carlo Donat-Cattin.l'Unit√†, 2 December 1977, pag. 4 Besides his wife Dedi Andreis, Carlo Casalegno left a 33-year-old son, Andrea, journalist and militant at Lotta Continua. During the trial in the Corte d'Assise, which took place in the summer of 1983, the Red Brigades' militants said they had chosen to kill Casalegno instead of kneecapping him (as they had done with Indro Montanelli) above all because of a brutal article of the 11 November '77 titled \\"Non occorrono leggi nuove, basta applicare quelle che ci sono. Terrorismo e chiusura dei covi\\" (New laws are not necessary, it's enough to apply the already existing ones).Paolo Borgna, Un paese migliore, Laterza, 2006, p.325 According to Peci, Casalegno was sentenced to death for having offended the memory of some members of the Red Army Faction (RAF) who died in jail in (Germany) between October and November 1977 (Io, l'infame, pag. 137). Legacy He was awarded the Gold Medal for Civil Valor and the Gold Medal as Terrorism Victim. In 1980 Rotary Club Roma Nord Ovest created a journalistic prize named after Casalegno. In February 2004 Carlo Casalegno was given a posthumous Honorary degree in law by the University of Turin.La Stampa, 9 February 2004, p. 27 See also * List of journalists killed in Italy  References   Bibliography  * Andrea Casalegno, L'attentato, chiarelettere, 2008. * Carlo Marletti, Francesco Bullo Il Piemonte e Torino alla prova del terrorismo, Rubbettino editore, 2004.

The film stars Jiiva, Riya Suman, Gayathri Krishnaa and Navdeep in the lead roles, with Varun and Sathish in supportive roles. D. Imman composes music for the film and the film is bankrolled by Ishari K. Ganesh under his production studio Vels Film International. Principal photography commenced on 4 December 2018. The film was released on 7 February 2020 and opened to positive reviews.  Plot  The film starts off with two girls driving on the road when they are stopped by two policemen, who proceed to attempt to rape them. One of the girls sends a voice message in a WhatsApp group telling their situation. Manimaran (Jiiva) hears the message and rescues them. He is from a neighbouring place called Mayavaram where he runs a local TV channel called Kokkarako TV. This is opposed by the MLA (R. N. R. Manohar), who keeps getting outsmarted by Maran. Exasperated, he pays a local goon named Vyasarpadi Malli (Varun) to kill him. Malli reaches Maran's home, where his pregnant sister Ilakkiya (Gayathri Krishnaa) goes into labour. Malli takes Ilakkiya to the hospital and admits her while providing her blood. Maran reaches the hospital and finds that his sister is out of danger and has given birth to a boy. Ilakkiya asks Maran to find the person who saved her and to bring him to her so that she can properly thank him. Maran finds out that the person was Malli, who had threatened to kill him. Maran keeps calling him, asking to meet him. Eventually, he finds Malli on the verge of death being backstabbed by his own henchmen. Maran beats up the henchmen who were nearby and admits Malli into Laksha Hospitals. It turns out that Malli's henchmen were ordered to torture Malli by Ashok Mithran (Navdeep), a leading advocate who was stabbed in court and who wants to know who stabbed him. He planned to torture Malli since he knows who did it. Mithran sends more goons to all hospitals, where Maran beats them up and admits them in Aruna Hospitals. Mithran deduces that Malli is in Laksha Hospitals and sends some goons there as well. Maran uses a walkie-talkie that a police officer left in a restaurant in a hurry, masquerading as a police officer. He eventually goes with the goons, who are instructed by Mithran to stand near a phone booth where Malli was last contacted. A girl contacts Malli's phone, which is tracked by Mithran, and he instructs his henchmen to kill her. Simultaneously, the MLA sends a photo of Maran to the henchmen who he is with. A fight breaks out between Maran and the goons where Maran emerges victorious. He saves the girls, who narrate their story to him. The state topper of their village is Pavithra, who was close friends with the girls. She is interviewed by the press, where she announces that she wants to become a lawyer and eradicate all wrongs in the law system. At the behest of a reporter, she names some cases, which are headed by Mithran, that she will take into account. She further insults Mithran on live television, causing him to get enraged. He sponsors many items to her, including theme park tickets. She is then killed by Mithran there, who then forces her grandfather to state that she was killed by a fall from the Ferris wheel. This enrages her friends who disguise themselves as lawyers and stab Mithran in court and are seen by Malli, who lets them go. They contact him and narrate their story and he agrees to help them before he is tortured by his own henchmen. Maran is moved by the story and offers to help them, but he is arrested by the police for stealing the walkie-talkie. However, he is let go when it is revealed that the girl he had saved at the beginning of the film is the officer's sister. He then goes to save the girls who were taken to Mithran. A fight between the two breaks out, where Maran defeats Mithran and lets the girls finish him. The film ends with Malli meeting Maran's sister and Maran's girlfriend Vasuki (Riya Suman).

Associated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, she served as Secretary of the Bureau for District of Alaska. She thoroughly identified herself with this work, and visited the region in 1897, that she might do better at directing it. She made an extended tour in the service of that region in the interests of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and supervised the erection of the building in Unalaska. Beiler was a prominent officer of the Woman's Home Missionary Society for many years and influential in the shaping of its policy and work.

In 1877, Dr. Beiler joined the Central Ohio Conference. Here, she took the full course of Conference studies and attended all the examinations. She was very active in church work, especially in revival services and in connection with the Woman's Missionary Society in which she became district and Conference officer. At the General Conference held in Cincinnati in 1880, Dr. and Mrs. Beiler offered themselves for Alaska to open up a new Mission, and her disappointment was great when they learned that the society was not prepared to begin the work. After seven years of work in Ohio, a transfer came to New York East Conference, and two years were spent in Hartford, Connecticut, and five in Brooklyn, New York. During these years, besides her activity in the churches, making pastoral calls with her husband, speaking for and organizing missionary societies, she became interested In the Methodist Home for the Aged that was being organized and built in Brooklyn. For two years, she edited and published a paper in connection with fairs held for the Home, from which she realized each year. She also edited a paper in the interest of the Brooklyn Hospital. Later, she did the same for the Methodist Hospital. At the close of the Brooklyn pastorate she went abroad with her husband, and ten months were spent in Ireland, England, and elsewhere in Europe, spending six weeks in each of the cities of London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin, studying in museums, art galleries, and universities. On their return to the U.S., one year was spent in Sands Street Church, Brooklyn, during which time she became officially identified with the Woman's Home Missionary Society, and was put on the committee in charge of the work in Alaska. When her husband became identified with the American University their residence was at Washington, D.C. and she had opportunities to study Alaska in the government departments, which resulted in her creating and becoming the first secretary of the Bureau for Alaska in the Woman's Home Missionary Society. Beiler served in the role for ten years. When it was found necessary for someone to go and superintend the building at Unalaska and visit other parts of the Territory. Beiler undertook the work in 1897. She visited southeastern Alaska, then sailed west along the coast, stopping at all possible points, getting the building under way at Unalaska, and then went to the Bering Sea, visiting Saint Michael's and coasting Cape Nome. From there, she went up the Yukon River to the Klondike, at the time the miners were coming out with the first gold of the Klondike Gold Rush. After seven months' unceasing travel, she returned home to Washington, D.C. suffering with the Klondike, or mining camp fever, for four months. During her tedious and long illness, her chief anxiety was that her husband should not be embarrassed in his work and that her daughters should not he hindered in their college studies. In 1898, after recovering, she visited a number of spring Conferences in the East and spoke to crowds that filled the churches. In the fall, she went West, speaking in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and as far Northwest as Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota. For two years, she kept up this overtaxing work until she was suddenly stricken at Defiance, Ohio with what seemed a partial paralysis, rendering her speechless for a day or two. Later years and death From the fall of 1899, she was compelled to restrain her activities, and the people of Buffalo, where her husband was pastor, had little chance to know of her abilities in organizing and managing work related to Church activities. Her invalidism was such that she was compelled to do her work largely through her writing. However, she was still able to superintended the construction of a hospital at Unalaska. She died on April 1, 1904, in Buffalo. Her funeral was held on Easter day in Richmond Avenue Church, Buffalo, of which Dr. Beiler was pastor. Interment was made In the family lot in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, where some years earlier, an older daughter had been buried. She was survived by her husband and daughters.

Digital computers were used in power system analysis or optimization as early as proto-\\"Whirlwind\\" in 1949. Circuitillustrated symbolic diagram :File:Biquad circuit.gif design theory or power network methodology was algebraic, symbolic, and often vector-based.  1940s‚Äì1950s  Between the mid-1940s and 1950s, various developments were made in computer software. Some of these developments include servo-motors controlled by generated pulse (1949), a digital computer with built-in operations to automatically coordinate transforms to compute radar related vectors (1951), and the graphic mathematical process of forming a shape with a digital machine tool (1952). In 1953, MIT researcher Douglas T. Ross saw the \\"interactive display equipment\\" being used by radar operators, believing it would be exactly what his SAGE- related data reduction group needed. Ross and the other researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory were the sole users of the complex display systems installed for the pre-SAGE Cape Cod system. Ross claimed in an interview that they \\"used it for their own personal workstation.\\" The designers of these early computers built utility programs to ensure programmers could debug software, using flowcharts on a display scope, with logical switches that could be opened and closed during the debugging session. They found that they could create electronic symbols and geometric figures to create simple circuit diagrams and flowcharts.Hurst, J. (1989) Retrospectives II: The Early Years in Computer Graphics, pp. 39‚Äì73 in SIGGRAPH 89 Panel Proceedings, ACM New York, NY, USA, These programs also enabled objects to be reproduced at will; it also was possible to change their orientation, linkage (flux, mechanical, lexical scoping), or scale. This presented numerous possibilities to them. Ross coined the term computer-aided design (CAD) in 1959.Ross, Douglas T. (17 March 1961). Computer-Aided Design: A Statement of Objectives. MIT USAF 8436-TM-4. 1960s Early example of electronic CAD, from Sutherland's 1963 dissertation The invention of the 3D CAD/CAM is attributed to French engineer Pierre B√©zier (Arts et M√©tiers ParisTech, Renault). Between 1966 and 1968, after his mathematical work concerning surfaces, he developed UNISURF to ease the design of parts and tools for the automotive industry. UNISURF then became the working base for the following generations of CAD software. In the 1960s, technological developments in the industries of aircraft, automotive, industrial control, and electronics provided advancements in the fields of three-dimensional surface construction, NC programming, and design analysis. Most of these developments were independent of one another and often not published until much later. Some of the mathematical description work on curves was developed in the early 1940s by Robert Issac Newton. In his 1957 novel The Door into Summer, Robert A. Heinlein hinted at the possibility of a robotic Drafting Dan. However, more substantial work on polynomial curves and sculptured surface was done by mathematician Paul de Casteljau from Citroen; Pierre B√©zier from Renault; Steven Anson Coons from MIT; James Ferguson from Boeing; Carl de Boor, George David Birkhoff and Garibedian from GM in the 1960s; and W. Gordon and R. Riesenfeld from GM in the 1970s. The development of the SKETCHPAD system at MITYares, Evan (February 13, 2013) 50 Years of CAD. DesignWorld by Ivan Sutherland, who later created a graphics technology company with David Evans, was a turning point. The distinctive feature of SKETCHPAD was that it allowed the designer to interact with their computer graphically; the design can be fed into the computer by drawing on a CRT monitor with a light pen. In effect, this feature of SKETCHPAD was a prototype for a graphical user interface, an indispensable feature of modern CAD. In 1963, under doctoral adviser Claude Shannon, Sutherland presented his PhD thesis paper, Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System, at a Joint Computer Conference. In his paper, he said: Over time, efforts would be directed toward the goal of having the designers' drawings communicate not just with shops, but also with the shop tool itself; however, it was a long time before this goal was achieved. The first commercial applications of CAD were in large companies within the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as in electronics. This was because only large corporations could afford the computers capable of performing the necessary calculations. Notable company projects included a joint project between Patrick J. Hanratty from GM and Sam Matsa, Doug Ross's MIT APT research assistant from IBM, to develop a prototype system for design engineers, DAC-1 (Design Augmented by Computer) 1964, Lockheed projects, Bell GRAPHIC 1, and Renault. One of the most influential events in the development of CAD was the founding of Manufacturing and Consulting Services Inc. (MCS) in 1971 by Patrick J. Hanratty, who wrote the system Automated Drafting And Machining (ADAM), but more importantly supplied code to companies such as McDonnell Douglas (Unigraphics), Computervision (CADDS), Calma, Gerber, Autotrol, and Control Data. As computers became more affordable, the application of CAD gradually expanded into new areas. The development of CAD software for personal desktop computers was the impetus for almost universal application in all areas of construction. 1970s Other notable events in the 1960s and 1970s include the foundation of CAD systems United Computing, Intergraph, IBM, and Intergraph IGDS in 1974 (which led to Bentley Systems MicroStation in 1984), as well as the Applicon in 1969 and commercial CAD systems from Japanese manufacturers Seiko and Zuken during the 1970s. CAD implementations have evolved dramatically since this early development. Initially, with 3D in the 1970s, CAD was typically limited to producing drawings similar to hand-drafted drawings. Advances in programming and computer hardware,Akeley, Kurt (1981) Issues and Directions for Graphics Hardware Accelerators . Eurographics Digital Laboratory, diglib.eg.org.Computer Graphics (4/5/1984). archive.org, most notably solid modeling in the 1980s, have allowed more versatile applications of computers in design activities. 1980s 3D rendering of spoons in CAD software In 1981, the key products were the solid modeling packages‚ÄîRomulus (ShapeData) and Uni-Solid (Unigraphics) based on PADL-2‚Äîand the surface modeler CATIA (Dassault Systemes). Autodesk was founded in 1982 by John Walker, which led to the two-dimensional system AutoCAD.Satheesh Gopi, September 2009. Basic Civil Engineering. Pearson Education India. p. 309. . The next milestone was the release of Pro/ENGINEER in 1987, which heralded greater usage of feature-based modeling methods and parametric linking of the parameters of features; this marked the introduction of parametric modeling.Elliot J. Gindis, 2011. Up and Running with AutoCAD 2012: 2D and 3D Drawing and Modeling. Academic Press. p. 716. . 1990s 3D rendering of a car in CAD software with boundary representation Also important to the development of CAD was the development in the late 1980s and early 1990s of B-rep solid modeling kernels (engines for manipulating geometrically and topologically consistent 3D objects), Parasolid (ShapeData), and ACIS (Spatial Technology Inc.). These developments were inspired by the work of Ian Braid. This subsequently led to the release of mid-range packages such as SolidWorks and TriSpective (later known as IRONCAD) in 1995, Solid Edge (then Intergraph) in 1996, and Autodesk Inventor in 1999. An independent geometric modeling kernel has been evolving in Russia since the 1990s.  2000s  Availability of free and open-source CAD software and high costs of advanced and 3D CAD software may restrain the growth of the CAD software market.

It was commissioned by the 34th Berlin Festival and written in 1984. Its first performance was given in Berlin on 11 September 1984 with dedicatee Gidon Kremer as soloist and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Christoph von Dohn√°nyi. Structure and style The concerto is scored for solo violin and an orchestra of: 3 flutes (no. 3 doubling alto flute), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 3 clarinets in B (no. 3 doubling bass clarinet in B), alto saxophone in E, 3 bassoons (no. 3 doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns in F, 4 trumpets in B, 4 trombones, contrabass tuba, percussion (6 players), harp, celesta, harpsichord, prepared piano, and strings. The movements are as follows: #Andante #Vivo #Adagio #Lento A performance typically lasts approximately 35 minutes. The concerto focuses its musical material on a monogram derived from the name of its dedicatee. : { \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"Andante (opening theme - bars 1 to 5)\\" \\\\time 4/4 {g'2 c2 d2 e'2} \\\\time 3/4 r1 \\\\time 4/4 {g'2 d2 e2 e'2} } \\\\addlyrics { G C D E G D E E } Thus, in the opening movement, the first four notes (bars 1 and 2) on bells and prepared piano spell out, in Anglo-Saxon and Tonic sol-fa music letter notation the note names G ‚Äì C (Do in Tonic sol-fa) ‚Äì D (Re in Tonic sol-fa) ‚Äì E, corresponding toGiDonKRemEr. The next four notes (bars 4 and 5), on the same instruments, spell out Gidon Kremer in a different way, using Anglo-Saxon letter notation only, thus G - D - E - E (an octave lower) forGiDonKrEmEr. These eight notes provide the principle theme (\\"Kremer theme\\") for the first movement and re-appear elsewhere in the concerto, particularly the final movement. Schnittke uses a similar technique to include a musical monogram of his own name: A ‚Äì F ‚Äì E ‚Äì D ‚Äì S ‚Äì C ‚Äì H ‚Äì E (in German notation S corresponds to E and H corresponds to B) in the music of this movement. The first movement is largely based on alternations between the Kremer theme and another warmer theme, introduced immediately after the Kremer theme's first appearance by woodwinds and horn, played initially in A major before shifting towards a darker C minor. The second movement, marked Vivo (lively), contrasts strongly with the first. It begins with the solo violin playing a moto perpetuo theme and then taking up a more lyrical melody. The soloist's role gradually thins out until Schnittke instructs them to perform a cadenza visuale, a \\"visual cadenza\\" in which they mime playing a cadenza but without actually producing any sound. The third movement begins in almost Baroque territory with the solo violin being accompanied by a chamber music group including harpsichord. This is soon and repeatedly interrupted by strident repetitions of themes from movements one and two. The finale consists of recollections of music from the previous three movements, as if summarising and commenting on what has preceded. Schnittke also weaves in musical monograms of fellow composers Edison Denisov, Sofia Gubaidulina and Arvo P√§rt. At the climax of the movement there is a second cadenza visuale before the concerto closes quietly with a repetition of the Kremer theme.

Early life  Thyra Samter was born to Louis Samter and Sara Harris Samter in Fort Smith, Arkansas on March 15, 1886 (though other sources list contradictory birth years). Her parents had married in May 1885; her family was Jewish, and her father ran a dry-goods store. At one point in her teen or early adult years, Samter wrote a society column for the Fort Smith Southwest American entitled \\"The Lady Clerk.\\" After graduating from high school, Samter briefly attended the University of Missouri. In 1909, she moved to Chicago, working in vaudeville theatre and as a feature writer for the Chicago Tribune. In 1912, she married writer John Seymour Winslow. They divorced some time in 1927; Thyra Samter Winslow married engineer Nelson Waldorf Hyde in December of the same year.  Writing career  Winslow began publishing stories in The Smart Set in 1914. By 1923, the magazine had published almost 100 of her stories, some under the pseudonyms Bruce Reid, Laura Kent Mason, Seumas Le Chat, Betting Calvert, and others. The first collection of Winslow's stories, Picture Frames, was published in 1923. She published her only novel, Show Business, in 1925. Doubleday published another collection of her stories, My Own, My Native Land in 1935; these stories were drawn from her writings for The New Yorker and other magazines, focusing on her home state of Arkansas.  Hollywood  In 1935, Winslow went to Hollywood to work on treatments and screenplays. Her story \\"She Married Her Boss\\" was made into a film of the same name that year. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Winslow was assigned to work on the screenplay for RKO Pictures' 1936 film Night Waitress, but nothing more is known about her contributions. Winslow also contributed to the treatment for Four Daughters (1938), adapted from Fannie Hurst's short story \\"Sister Act.\\" The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Screenplay, Best Picture, and Best Director.

She was listed in the 1978 World Almanac as one of eleven famous Arkansans. Edna Ferber called Winslow \\"a new master of the short story\\" in a blurb that appears on the cover of The Sex Without Sentiment.

Using a montage technique, it documents the making of David Lynch's critically acclaimed film, Blue Velvet, using a combination of filmed footage, photographs and interviews captured on set by Braatz, with an accompanying soundtrack by Cult With No Name, Tuxedomoon and John Foxx.  Background and production  Peter Braatz had worked as a musician fronting the German avant- garde punk band S.Y.P.H. before moving to Berlin in the early eighties to study film. He first made contact with Lynch in 1983, sending a critique on Lynch's The Elephant Man with a proposal to interview him to Mel Brooks, who had produced the film. Lynch wrote back several months later and they exchanged letters over the following two years. In 1985, and out of the blue, Lynch invited Braatz to document the making of his new film in Wilmington, North Carolina, which became Blue Velvet. Braatz traveled with a friend and stayed on set for 3 months, taking only Super 8 cameras and reels (due to cost and weight), a tape recorder and a camera. Lynch granted Braatz unrestricted access to the set, cast and crew, with only some restrictions placed on where Braatz could film Isabella Rossellini as she was still under contract to Lancome. Braatz first released a film based on what he documented as No Frank in Lumberton in 1988. The film was avant-garde in its approach and had only limited distributed through German television station ZDF and a handful of festivals. In 2013, Braatz was in his studio listening to the track \\"As Below\\" by British band Cult With No Name and was inspired to revisit his footage and put together a proposal based around this piece of music for a new film using his archived Blue Velvet footage. Funding for the film was provided by the German Film Foundation and the Slovenian Bela-Film. Before editing began, Braatz commissioned Cult With No Name to produce the soundtrack, as it was always his intention to edit to music as much of his material was silent having been filmed using Super 8. Cult With No Name invited Tuxedomoon and John Foxx to join them in producing the soundtrack, which was released on Crammed Discs in 2015 on vinyl and CD, a whole year before the film. The soundtrack received significant press coverage and was met with extremely positive reviews, The Wire describing it as \\"... evocative, dreamy, dark and dynamic.\\" The CD included a booklet of previously unreleased photographs taken on set. \\"No News\\", the song that closes Blue Velvet Revisited and did not appear on the soundtrack, was subsequently released by the Cult With No Name on their Heir of the Dog album in 2017. Editing and production of the film took over a year in total. Opening titles and chapter titles for the film were provided by acclaimed graphic designer Jonathan Barnbrook, most famous for his work with David Bowie. Braatz himself dubbed the film \\"a meditation on a movie\\", making an important distinction between his approach and a conventional documentary with narration.  Release  Blue Velvet Revisited was premiered at the Institute of Contemporary Arts as part of the BFI London Film Festival on 7 October 2016. This coincided with the 30th anniversary of the release of the original film. the next day, and at Lynch's request, the film received its US premiere at the Lynch's Festival of Disruption. The screening was followed by a Q+A with Laura Dern and Kyle MacLachlan. Since then the film has appeared a large number of notable festivals, galleries and cinemas worldwide, including CPH:DOX, Doc NYC, and MALBA. In February 2019, The Criterion Collection announced a deluxe reissue of Blue Velvet on DVD and Blu-ray with Blue Velvet Revisited included as an extra. In 2020, the track \\"Lumberton\\" from the soundtrack of Blue Velvet Revisited, was licensed to be used in the HBO series The New Pope, starring Jude Law and John Malkovich.  Reception  The film has gained positive reviews, with a current Rotten Tomatoes rating of 83%. The Hollywood Reporter described the film as \\"... a quietly mesmerizing sensory experience, with a distinctive rhythm and look that makes it a stand-alone artwork rather than a mimetic mirror of its subject.\\" Sam Gray of The Upcoming went further and commented, \\"with a terrific soundtrack and its insightful, rare footage, Blue Velvet Revisited is nirvana for Lynch nerds; though even those with a perfunctory interest in filmmaking could do with seeing this fascinating gem.\\" References External links  Homepage for Cult With No Name Category:2016 films Category:2016 documentary films Category:David Lynch ","title":"Blue Velvet Revisited"},{"id":"60038314","text":"Oskar Holinger (born 22 July 1918) was a Swiss wrestler.

Artistic career Felicia Meyer, Vermont Hillside, oil on linen, 1940, 28 1/16 √ó 34 1/16 inches Felicia Meyer, Cocktails on the Terrace, oil on masonite, before 1950, 30 x 22 inches Felicia Meyer, Still Life With Flowers, oil on canvas, 1950, 24 x 20 inches On completing her art studies she participated in shows held in both Manhattan and Manchester, Vermont. Early in 1932 she participated in a small group exhibition held at the G.R.D. Gallery in Manhattan, that summer she contributed paintings to a large group exhibition held by the Southern Vermont Artists Association in Manchester, and at the end of the year her work appeared in a group exhibition at the Jumble Shop gallery. In the succeeding years of the 1930s Meyer regularly contributed paintings to exhibitions in Manhattan and Manchester. Early in 1935 she showed at a gallery run by the National Association of Women Artists in a group of former League students that included Dean Fausett, Horace Day, Fairfield Porter, and Elizabeth Nottingham and later that year showed again in the annual exhibition held by Southern Vermont artists. During the 1940s, critics rarely noticed her paintings in group shows, but she received attention for solo exhibitions in 1942 (at the Wakefield Gallery) and 1944 (at the Macbeth Gallery). In 1957, 1969, and 1974 her paintings appeared in solo shows at the Frank K.M. Rehn Gallery. Over the course of her career Meyer came to be known best for her landscapes of the Vermont locale where she spent the summer months. Her 1940 painting, \\"Vermont Hillside,\\" (shown at left) is typical of these landscapes. She was also known for depictions of the New York locale where she spent the cooler months. Her painting, \\"Cocktails on the Terrace\\" (shown at right) is typical of these. She was also known for her floral still lifes, such as the one shown at left and figure studies, such as the self portrait shown at right. Artistic practice Meyer usually painted in oil on canvas. Personal life Meyer was an only child, daughter of the artists, Herbert William Meyer (1882-1960) and Anne Norton Meyer (1885-1958). In 1934 she married the artist Reginald Marsh (1898-1954). The couple had no children.

Dorsey's life came into focus when Penny Petersen published Minneapolis Madams: The Lost History of Prostitution on the Riverfront in 2013. Part African-American, Dorsey catered only to whites and was among the city's most prominent and successful madams. The brothel she built at 212 Eleventh Avenue South is the only one still standing from Minneapolis' three red-light districts ( 1870s ‚Äì 1910). Dorsey is also remembered for her long- term friendship with Carleton Pillsbury, scion of the Pillsbury family. Early life and family In 1866, Ida Callahan was born to Mary (or Maria) Turner, most likely an African-American woman, and John Callahan, likely a white man, in Woodford County, Kentucky.Petersen (2013), p. 85. Kentucky outlawed interracial marriage, so her parents never married. Roberta, her younger sister and only full sibling, later known as \\"Birdie Berts,\\" would join Dorsey's business.Petersen (2013), p. 92. Later, her mother left for Fayette County. Mary married George Burkes (also spelled Burke or Burk) and had several sons. Nebraska Burkes, one of her sons, would play ragtime piano in Dorsey's establishment.Petersen (2013), p. 118. Ida Burkes once claimed to have operated a bordello from the age of 16.Petersen (2013), p. 86. First brothels Ida Burkes moved from Kentucky to Minnesota and, by 1885, lived with John Hershfield in St. Paul. After adopting the name Dorsey, in 1886 Dorsey ran a bordello at 5th Street & Jackson Street, reported to be \\"a very tough place\\" catering to African-American soldiers. Perhaps attracted by the city's wealth, Dorsey moved to Minneapolis in 1886, where she employed seven or eight women of color. Appearing to be an old ramshackle exterior at 125 Second Street North, inside the house held beautiful carpets, fancy wallpaper, and elegant furniture.Petersen (2013), pp. 86‚Äì87. Serving only white customers, the women danced the can-can, which the Minneapolis police chief had outlawed, and performed shadow dances in silhouette. African-American leaders once circulated a petition asking to close her down. Other criticism came from African-American men who objected to her whites-only policy.Petersen (2013), p. 88. In 1886, when she was twenty- two, Dorsey was convicted as \\"Mary Coon\\" of selling liquor without a license and running a house of prostitution. Dorsey felt she had cooperated and had contributed towards a liquor license. Other madams were only fined, but Dorsey served 76 days of a 90-day sentence in the Minnesota State Prison in Stillwater, with time off for good behavior. Move across Hennepin Upon her return from prison in late 1886, Dorsey leased 119 Second Street North from madam Carrie Moore. She and several other established madams were fined 200 to 350, but they all escaped imprisonment.Petersen (2013), p. 91. Dorsey moved her business to what had become the city's premier red-light district, opening in 1887, on the site formerly used by Etta Forrest, at 116 Second Avenue South. Her sister Roberta had joined her by this time and is recorded as having paid the monthly fine of 80. Eleventh Avenue Dorsey's sporting house on Eleventh Avenue, which Petersen describes as Richardsonian Romanesque and Larry Millett describes as Romanesque Revival. A community largely of immigrants who lacked political clout was unable to resist the building of a new red-light district in its midst.Petersen (2013), pp. 108‚Äì110. In November 1890, Dorsey began her move to Eleventh Avenue, following the lead of madams Mabel Baker, aka Mary Allen, and her sister Frances Stewart, aka Frances Myers, who were the area's main property owners.Petersen (2013), pp. 110‚Äì113. Much like other brothels in the city, the land at 212 Eleventh Avenue South transferred hands in deals meant to conceal its ownership. First, Andrew Haugan who had served on the city council and his wife Louise sold the property to Carolina Anderson, who took out a building permit with the city for a three-story, 12,000 apartment structure. Anderson's husband, Zacharias, became the general contractor. Another party, John L. Anderson, owned the building in trust for Carolina Anderson and Ida Dorsey. A former alderman and park commissioner supplied the lumber. Dorsey spent a further 15,000 to decorate the interior. She sent out announcements of its opening to everyone, even to pastors who were mainly interested in seeing her closed down.Petersen (2013), p. 114. Dorsey had been in Minneapolis for only five years, but already she was her own landlord. The deal closed in 1906 when Dorsey gained the title, using the name Callahan. She continued to entertain whites exclusively, attracting a formidable lineup of clients. A St. Paul paper said she refused entry even to Harris Martin, a storied African-American boxer known as \\"The Black Pearl\\". Petersen cites a Twin Cities Reporter account that said Dorsey would never be raided because \\"some pretty big guns would be grabbed there, and the papers would have some great stories.\\"Petersen (2013), p. 115. Friends and family De Cleanin' Man, sung by Al Jolson and others, published by C. C. Pillsbury Co. in 1906 In 1891, Dorsey had a stillborn child, who is buried in the family plot. In 1898, Bertie died of cancer. Dorsey took charge of Bertie's daughter Alvah Hunton and left most of her estate to Hunton when she died. In the 1890s, Dorsey invited her mother and half-brothers from Kentucky. In 1904, she bought a home for them in south Minneapolis.Petersen (2013), p. 116. During the early 1900s, Dorsey became friends with Carleton Pillsbury, who loved music and acting, and who, in his short life, became a music publisher.Petersen (2013), pp. 117‚Äì118. After Carleton died, Dorsey sometimes used the name Mrs. Ida Pillsbury. The son of Frederick and Alice Pillsbury, Carleton was the nephew of flour miller Charles Alfred Pillsbury, grandson of mayor George A. Pillsbury, and great-nephew of governor John S. Pillsbury. Petersen in 2013 told the Twin Cities Daily Planet that Pillsbury may have had a fascination with stereotypical African-American culture: \\"he performed in black face and published stereotypical sheet music.\\" (Example at right.) Back to St. Paul Through various means, Minneapolis decided to oust its madams. A citizens' purity crusade, reformers' hysterical belief in white slavery, discrimination against about 86 Chinese immigrants, the Ames trials of a former mayor, grand architectural city remakes, the temperance movement, and anti-corruption activists were behind a raid and arrest of 19 madams including Dorsey in April 1910.Petersen (2013), Chapter 4, \\"Reforming the City\\". Caught up in a vice raid in 1911, Dorsey decided that public opinion was against her in Minneapolis. In 1913, she opened a brothel at 151 South Washington Street in St. Paul, a site owned by madam Nina Clifford. Dorsey paid 1000 to Clifford for the house and 3000 to various city officials, who ultimately were convicted of graft and jailed. She was open for only a few months and is quoted as feeling \\"like a dummy\\" for having made the move.Petersen (2013), p. 167. She was now over forty years old and not wealthy enough to retire.Petersen (2013), p. 170. In 1907, Dorsey had diversified her investments when she bought an apartment building with a grocery store on the main floor at 1214‚Äì1220 First Avenue South, now Marquette Avenue.Petersen (2013), pp. 116‚Äì117. She owned brothels in Duluth and in Superior, Wisconsin.Petersen (2013), p. 168. She was persecuted, beginning in 1914, by the publisher of the Twin Cities Reporter who called her vile names and enjoyed hounding her on his front page. (Petersen calls the man obsessed.)Petersen (2013), p. 168‚Äì170. The Marquette Avenue property was used as a brothel and as Dorsey's home when she became ill. Dorsey monument at Lakewood Cemetery Death Dorsey developed cancer and was a patient at Eitel Hospital. She died at age 52 on June 18, 1918, and is buried with the child she lost, her mother Maria Burkes, possibly her stepfather George Burkes, her sister Roberta, and half-brothers Moses, George, Henry, and Nebraska, in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.

Signs and symptoms The onset is in infancy. The skin lesions occur on cheeks, nose, fingers, toes and soles.Jeremiah N, Neven B, Gentili M, Callebaut I, Maschalidi S, Stolzenberg M-C, Goudin N, Fremond, M-L, Nitschke P, Molina TJ, Blanche S, Picard C, Rice GI, Crow YJ, Manel N, Fischer A, Bader-Meunier B, Rieux-Laucat, F (2014) Inherited STING-activating mutation underlies a familial inflammatory syndrome with lupus-like manifestations. J Clin Invest 124: 5516-5520 They may vary in appearance but frequently develop into non-healing ulcers. Interstitial lung disease is also common. All affected children fail to thrive. Other features include myositis and joint stiffness. Imaging: Chest X rays show sign consistent with interstitial lung disease. Bloods: Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytosis, T cell lymphopenia with normal B cells and hypergammaglobulinemia may occur. Autoantibodies may be present including antinuclear, antiphospholipid, and anticardiolipin antibodies. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein levels tend to be raised. Biopsies: Skin biopsies show inflammation of the capillaries and microthrombosis. Immunoglobulin M and C3 deposition may be present. Lung biopsies show alveolitis, follicular hyperplasia, B-cell germinal centers and interstitial fibrosis. Genetics This condition is due to mutations in the TMEM173 gene. This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q31.2) and encodes the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein. There are 3 disease causing mutations in the dimerization domain of STING that cause SAVI; V155M, N154S, and V147L. Pathopysiology This only partly understood. The wild type protein (STING) is normally found in the cytoplasm of the cell. The mutant forms are located in the Golgi apparatus. Diagnosis The condition may be suspected on clinical grounds. The diagnosis is made by sequencing the TMEM173 gene. Treatment No specific treatment is known. Management is supportive. Epidemiology This condition is considered rare, with 9 cases reported in the literature up to 2019. Research  This condition was first described in 2014.Liu Y, Jesus AA, Marrero B, Yang D, Ramsey SE, Montealegre Sanchez GA, Tenbrock K, Wittkowski H, Jones OY, Kuehn HS, Lee C-C R, DiMattia M A, and 40 others.

Dr. Miner's research team used CRISPR-CAS9 genome editing to introduce a mutation into the mouse STING gene (TMEM173) that was analogous to a human SAVI-associated mutation. These mice, known as STING N153S mice, developed spontaneous lung disease and a severe immunodeficiency to a herpesviruses.

Players control Nikola Tesla as he attempts to stop H. P. Lovecraft and his army of monsters.  Gameplay  Horror author H. P. Lovecraft interrupts a demonstration of Nikola Tesla's newest invention. Tesla ignores Lovecraft's warnings, only to find that Lovecraft has become possessed by Cthulhu. Lovecraft steals all of Tesla's inventions and uses them to open a dimensional gateway for the monsters described in his fiction. Players take the role of Tesla as he fights the monsters, initially armed with conventional arms and a teleporter. Players can upgrade Tesla's weaponry as they find items, up to a mecha, and power-ups grant him brief advantages. Killing large numbers of monsters allows players to select perks, which grant special abilities during all fights on that level. Dying allows players to choose different perks, and they are reset when moving on to a new level.  Release  Tesla vs Lovecraft was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux on January 26, 2018. The PlayStation 4 version was released on March 13, 2018; the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch versions were released three days later. The iOS version launched on October 25, 2018. The Android version launched on May 2, 2019.  Reception  Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer called the iOS version a \\"wonderfully violent and perfectly challenging shooter\\". Writing for TouchArcade, Jared Nelson called it \\"an absolutely fantastic top-down shooter\\" and 10tons's best game, despite some issues with the iOS controls. Reviewing the PlayStation 4 version for Push Square, Ken Talbot wrote, \\"The PS4 isn't exactly wanting for top down shooters, yet despite the familiarity of its execution, there‚Äôs just so much to enjoy here.\\" Andrew Reiner of Game Informer wrote, \\"Tesla vs. Lovecraft seems simple at first, but the way the environments are used is quite clever.\\" The Nintendo Switch version, reviewed in Nintendo World Report by David Keremes, was criticized for lack of online co-op gameplay and the sameness of the levels. Kermes, however, said that it \\"looks and feels great\\", concluding that it is \\"a solid and fun twin-stick shooter\\".

It is situated near Bucelas in the Loures municipality in the Lisbon District of Portugal. History The threat of invasion of Portugal by the French during the Peninsular War (1807‚Äì14) led to the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras in late 1809 and 1810, in order to protect Lisbon from Napol√©on Bonaparte's troops. Consisting of 152 forts and redoubts forming three lines of defence, the construction was ordered by the British commander, the Duke of Wellington, after two French invasions had already been repelled. By so doing he was also seeking to protect his own retreat and possible evacuation if overwhelmed by French forces. The first line of defence of the Lines of Torres Vedras successfully repelled the French and the Mosqueiro fort never saw battle. Description Situated on the Ribas escarpment on a basalt hill, the Mosqueiro fort was built at an altitude of 332 metres and was designed for a garrison of 270 soldiers in order to control access along the Montachique, Ribas and S√£o Gi√£o gorges. It was work number 52 of the Lines and is believed to have had three cannon. In addition to having a commanding view of the gorges, it was close to, and had a good view of, the Fort of Ribas (also known as the Redoubt of Freixial) on the same escarpment. The fort included a magazine, gun emplacements, and an inner square for assembling troops, and was protected by palisades and a dry moat. Present day In March 2012, the Municipality of Loures inaugurated a Centre of Interpretation of the Lines of Torres. It is attached to the Wine Museum in Bucelas and has the objective of making known to visitors the whole history of the fortifications built during the French invasions, particularly in the Bucelas area.

It developed via the creolization of African religions during the slave era in Jamaica. It incorporates ritualistic magic, spiritual possession and dancing. Unlike Obeah, its practices focus more on the connection of spirits with humans.Paul Easterling, \\"The Ifa‚Äô Diaspora: The Art of Syncretism, Part 5 ‚Äì Obeah and Myal\\" in (Afrometrics.org, 2017). Over time, Myal began to meld with Christian practices and created the religious tradition known as Revivalism. Today, the term \\"myal\\" is commonly used to describe the state of possession by a spirit. History Origin The practice of Myal as a spirit possession originated in Jamaica. It derived from the Kongo religion. It was once theorized to be of Akan origin, because of its popularity with Akan slaves. However, Myal was also popular with Kongo slaves. The centrality of spirit possession is a core component of both Myal and Kongo religion. This evidence suggests that Myal is more closely related to Kongo. Myalism resulted from the cooperation of ethnically diverse African slaves. The term \\"Myal\\" was first recorded by Edward Long in 1774 when describing a ritual dance done by Jamaican slaves. At first, the practices of Obeah and Myal were not distinguished. Over time, \\"Myal-men\\" involved in spirit possession became involved with Jamaican Native Baptist churches and incorporated Myal rituals into them. Over time, these Myal-influenced churches began preaching the importance of baptisms and the eradication of Obeah, thus separating the two traditions. Christianization After the abolition of slavery, conservative Christian churches began to lose followers to Bedwardism and Myalist Native Baptist Churches. After 1814, the Myalist chapels started to become more visible. By the 1840s, many Congolese indentured laborers arrived in Jamaica where they revitalised Myal practices and the Kumina religion. Myal was generally tolerated by slave owners because of its stance against Obeah and its adoption of Christian elements. By the 1860s, Myal-based churches became referred to as \\"Revivalist\\" churches and were established as Baptist churches. From 1858 to 1859, a Christian revival swept Jamaica, adding energy to local religious life. Two branches of this revival, the 60 Order or Revival Zion and the 61 Order or Pocomania, emerged. Revival Zion adopted more orthodox Christian practices, while Pocomania continued more African practices. Myal as a separate religion is no longer practiced, its rituals can be found in Revivalism, Kumina, and Convince. Practices Early Myalist religion Myalists honor a creator god and ancestor or African spirits. These spirits are invoked in Myal rituals. It holds that a human has two souls: the duppy, which departs the Earth after death, and the second spirit, which acts as the person's shadow and needs protection from evil. Under slavery, Myalists would ingest a mix of cold water and branched calalue to induce an intoxicated state and then dance to commune with the spirits. Revivalism Most Revivalist faiths involve oral confessions, trances, dreams, prophesies, spirit seizures, and frenzied dancing. In Pocomania, male religious leaders are usually called \\"Shepherd\\", and in Revival Zion, the male leaders are called \\"Captain\\". Female leaders are generally called \\"mother\\".

Danmark leaving Fredrikshavn for the Danmark Expedition to NE Grenland 1906-1908 The ship was built in Sunderland, England in 1855, rigged as a three-masted steam bark and originally fitted with a 98 hp high pressure steam engine. She sailed under the name Sir Colin Campell on whaling trips from Scotland to the Greenland Sea and Davis Strait. In 1892 she was sold to Norway, refitted with a 200 hp triple expansion engine, renamed Magdalena and sailed as a seal catcher until 1906. The later polar explorer Roald Amundsen sailed on Magdalena in 1884 on a seal hunt into the West Ice. From the records of the oil factory of J.A. Nielson in T√∏nsberg it is reported that Magdalena, owned by Gustav C. Hansen, was the first ship to process blubber at the factory when it opened in 1883 (1,300-1,400 barrels of seal oil). In 1901 the ship was used to deploy stores on Shannon Island and Bass Rock, East Greenland for the American Baldwin- Ziegler Expedition. In 1906 Magdalena was sold for a price of 39,250 kroner to the Danish Expedition Fund, to serve as ship for the upcoming expedition to Northeast Greenland. She underwent refurbishing and was rechristened to Danmark.  Danmark Expedition  Danmark left Copenhagen 24 June 1906 and left for Greenland on 2 July after a short stop in Frederikshavn. Leader of the expedition was shared between Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen (who did not return from the expedition but died on the ice at Nioghalvfjerds Fjorden) and captain of the ship Alf Trolle. Danmark reached the West Ice in late July and with some difficulties passed through the ice and reached a protected bay, which they named Danmark Havn (Danmark harbour) after the ship and which became the base for the ship during two overwinterings. Other places in NE Greenland named after Danmark are Danmarksfjorden and Danmarksmonumentet, a mountain near Morkefjord. Danmark left Greenland on 21 July 1908 and although the boiler was damaged in a collision with an iceberg in the West Ice, she reached Bergen in Norway safely on 15 August and returned to Copenhagen on 23 August.  Later fate  Upon return to Copenhagen Danmark was set for sale. In the meantime, in the summer 1909 she went on another voyage to Greenland, this time to Qaanaaq (Thule), before being sold in 1910 to the mining company Gr√∏nlandsk Minedrift A/S for the price of 15,000 kroner. The ship continued to sail on Greenland, transporting ore and minerals to Denmark, until unfortunate events led to its loss in 1917. When Danmark returned from Greenland with 130 ton of Cryolite and ore the crew had been away from civilization for so long that they were unaware of the outbreak of the first world war and met no ships on their return voyage that could tell them. Thus, when they reached the entrance to the Sound, they did not know that all lighthouses had been switched off and they ran aground on the Swedish coast at H√∂gan√§s. The crew was rescued, but the ship could not be saved and was later towed to Helsing√∏r, where it was broken up in 1918.

Life  Christened on 22 February 1781 at Romsey, Hampshire, she was the daughter of Major Benjamin Godfrey of the Inniskilling Dragoons and his wife Henrietta. On 9 July 1796, with the apparent consent of her widowed mother, she was married to Matthew Moriarty of Chatham, Kent, a Major in the Royal Marines. Matthew Moriarty was not a good provider and his early death left numerous debts and a destitute widow with 4 children. Henrietta took in two or three ladies as boarders in order to generate some income. Since drawing had always been one of her accomplishments, it was suggested that she publish a botanical work by subscription. Whilst living at Boley Hill near Rochester she produced a set of 50 plates which, for the greater part, were copied from Curtis‚Äôs Botanical Magazine, seemingly with no copyright objections and published in 1807. The book‚Äôs subscription list was headed by Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, and was dedicated to Lady de Clifford, who also bought five copies. Sophia de Clifford was married to the 20th Baron de Clifford, Edward Southwell of Kings Weston, near Bristol, and after his death in 1786 she rented Nyn Park at Northaw before settling at a villa in Paddington. She collected rare and exotic plants, was often mentioned in botanical publications, and introduced a number of species previously unknown in England. She also was governess to Princess Charlotte, the daughter of George IV.http://www.kwag.org.uk/2015/07/13/the-flowers-of-lady-de-clifford/ Other subscribers were the Margravine of Ansbach, Henry Peyto-Verney, 16th Baron Willoughby de Broke, and the Bishop of St Davids.

The term is proposed as an etymologically corruptive derivative of shandrar, the older term for the community.  History  They were originally tree-climbers and toddy tappers. They claim origin from the Shanars of South India, who settled in Sri Lanka, initially in the Puttalam region, due to social clashes and overpopulation in South India. The Jaffna Kingdom were known for exporting elephants, which were caught in the Vanni region and maintained by the Cantars. The Cantars had to pay taxes to the Jaffna kings for producing jaggery and pinattu (a sweet or pulp, made of dried palmyra fruit). According to the Jaffna chronicle, Yalpana Vaipava Malai, there were the Nalavar (palm tree climber and toddy tappers) known as Nambis. After withdrawing from a battle, the Nambis made a living by being hired by Cantars or Shanars and eventually taking up their hereditary occupation as palm tree climbers and toddy tappers.

After a series of resignations by its prioresses, the establishment was in a state of turmoil, and the Archbishop of York, William Greenfield, appointed one of the nuns to lead the house. His candidate, Emma de Ebor' (Emma of York), was deemed unacceptable by many nuns, who undermined her from the start to the extent that she resigned three months later. The archbishop, forced to find another candidate, claimed that he was unable to do so from within the priory and appointed Joan de Pykering from nearby Rosedale Priory. It is likely that Keldholme saw de Pykering as an intruder, and it seems to have reacted against her in much the same way as to her predecessor. In response, the archbishop attempted to quash the nuns' rebelliousness. Individuals identified by him and his officials were exiled to surrounding priories, while at one point Keldholme itself was placed under interdict and the nuns threatened with excommunication. The convent was not deterred: the campaign against de Pykering continued until eventually Greenfield allowed the prioress to resign and the nuns to elect one of their number again. They re-elected Emma de Stapleton, who had previously resigned the position in 1301, but she also seems to have become unpopular with the nuns. Archbishop Greenfield died in 1315, and within two months, de Stapleton had also resigned, supposedly because of ill health and age. The nuns of Keldholme re-elected Emma de Ebor', the election dispute evaporated and little more was heard of the priory until its dissolution in 1536. Background St Mary of Keldholme Priory, founded during the reign of King Henry I, was a small Cistercian nunnery situated a couple of miles east of Kirkbymoorside, Yorkshire. Few of the prioresses names have been recorded, and the Victoria County History (VCH) comments that \\"there is remarkably little known of the history of the house\\" until the 14th century, when a disputed election for a prioress led to some years of turmoil. Religious houses in Yorkshire were prone to internal disorder in the early 14th century. This was the second disputed election for a Yorkshire prioress in 15 years; in 1290, John le Romeyn, Greenfield's predecessor, had appointed Josiana de Anlaby Prioress of Swine Priory and a similar crisis of leadership had occurred. Keldholme itself had suffered two recent resignations of its Prioresses in 1294 and 1301, by Beatrice of Grendale and Emma de Stapleton respectively. The priory's reputation was further damaged by suspicions that the Sheriff of Cleveland, Geoffrey of Eston, was engaging in sexual activities with nuns in both Keldholme and Arden priories. De Stapleton's 1301 resignation was probably directly related to Archbishop Melton's episcopal visitation of the same year, in the course of which he discovered malpractice. As a result, the priory was without a prioress for the following seven years. On 17 April 1308, the Archbishop of York, William Greenfield, issued an official inquiry regarding the current vacancy. This commission was required to establish three things: when the vacancy had begun, how long Keldholme had lacked the necessary leadership, and whether this had lasted more than six months. The final criterion was significant because a vacancy of over six months allowed the archbishop to bypass the nuns' right to appoint their own prioress, and install a candidate of his choosing. The commission was headed by two local rectors, who were instructed that, if it was discovered that the nuns' right to elect a prioress had not lapsed they were to do so within one month. The rectors' task did not take long, and although they were equivocal regarding the precise length of the vacancy, they reported that the appointment was now the archbishop's responsibility on account of the lapse of time. Three days later, the Archbishop‚Äîprobably on the recommendation of his commission‚Äîappointed Emma de Ebor' as prioress, believing her the best- qualified candidate from among the nuns. Disputed elections Pykering appointed Remains of Joan de Pykering's Rosedale Priory in 2008, from where she came in 1308 and to where she returned in 1309 Much of what is known of subsequent events at Keldholme comes from a letter written by the Archbishop to the Archdeacon of Cleveland, now extant in the Archiepiscopal Registers. Emma de Ebor' seems to have been unpopular with the convent from the moment of her election, and the Archdeacon was instructed to investigate certain Keldholme nuns. These were Beatrix de Roston, Mary de Holm, Isabella de Langetoft, Anabilla de Lokton, Orphania de Nueton, and Joan de Roseles, who, among others‚Äîincluding lay people‚Äîrefused obedience to Emma and were accused of undermining her. All were subsequently adjudged guilty of insubordination to their prioress. Because this represented at least half the convent, Emma de Ebor' resigned on 30 July the same year. Greenfield was forced to accept her cession as prioress and on 5August announced that, finding no suitable candidate from within Keldholme itself, he had chosen Joan de Pykering from the nearby Benedictine Rosedale Priory. She, says the VCH, \\"from the testimony of trustworthy persons, was deemed competent\\" and of \\"good reputation\\"; it is probable that she had indicated willingness to put Keldholme in order at Greenfield's command. Janet Burton emphasises that this was an appointment rather than an election, and notes that the imposition of an outsider meant that the Archbishop had revoked their privilege to elect their own head. The same nuns who had opposed de Stapleton's regime were \\"equally resistant\\" to that of Pykering's. It is likely, Burton suggests, that a lack of calibre among Keldholme's nuns accounted for the long interregnum between prioresses in 1308 and 1309. The Archdeacon placed de Pykering in corporeal possession of the priory, and rebuked those nuns who had opposed her predecessor. They were to accept the new prioress without question immediately, he said, as were \\"certain laymen who had prevented her from exercising her office\\". The latter numbered nine in all, five of whom were from Kirkbymoorside. The Archdeacon's efforts to impose an episcopal peace came to nothing. In the words of the medievalist Eileen Power, \\"pandemonium reigned\\" at Keldholme, and the Archbishop was forced to visit officially. Writing to the Sheriff of Cleveland on 3September, Greenfield wrote that Sisters de Holm, de Langetoft, de Lokton and de Roseles were irredeemable troublemakers and that they were to be separated and transferred to disparate abbeys for penance. Three others‚Äîincluding the ex-prioress, Emma de Stapleton‚Äîappear to have also left Keldholme, but without permission; they were summoned before the Archbishop. Relations between the priory and the Archbishop were by now, says the historian Martin Heale, \\"acrimonious\\", and the removal of individual nuns from the arena had done nothing to improve them. OnFebruary 1309, Greenfield wrote to Keldholme's sub-prioress and the convent. He insisted that they immediately write to Lady Joan Wake, Lady of Liddell,‚Äîthe priory's patron‚Äîinforming her that they willingly accepted de Pykering to head their house. They were also to emphasise their obedience and support for Joan, and request Wake to restore Pykering to possession of the temporalities of the priory as soon as possible. Seen by the nuns as an \\"imported... interloper\\", Power described Joan at this time as, \\"a luckless exile in the tents of Kedar\\". Four days later the Archbishop instigated a commission to investigate the offences he had uncovered, and placed the priory under interdict until Pykering was accepted as prioress. Resignations The Archbishop's efforts came to nothing, says Burton, and Greenfield was forced to concede that Pykering was not the best choice for the priory. On the 14th, Greenfield instructed the commission to discuss de Pykering's future with her. They were to establish whether she wished to resign; if she did, the sub-prioress and convent were instructed to hold an election to choose a new superior. De Pykering resigned as prioress of Keldholme the same month and returned to Rosedale; her opponents in Keldholme, says Power, \\"were triumphant\\". On 7March 1309 they elected one of their own, Emma de Stapleton, back into the position she had held eight years' previously; De Stapleton may have been an acceptable choice for Greenfield also, as he subsequently granted permission for her niece to board within the priory. Greenfield was able to get some revenge on those who had obstructed his plans. One of the laymen of the priory, one Nicholas de Rippinghall‚Äîone of those responsible for previously fomenting opposition to Emma de Ebor'‚Äîreceived a heavy penance from Greenfield. For the disruption he had caused at Keldholme, declared Greenfield‚Äî Other nuns were removed by Greenfield to Esholt and Nunkeeling priories at around the time of de Stapleton's election, but this was probably for reasons of immorality rather than any connection to the political dispute. Acrimony in the convent The election of de Stapleton did not bring the affair to a close. She was continually insulted and disobeyed, particularly by Emma de Ebor' and Mary de Holme. The former, says Power, \\"could not forget that she had once been prioress\\" at Keldholme, and the latter‚Äîwho had either returned from Swine or, perhaps, had disobeyed the Archbishop and never left Keldholme‚Äîforced Greenfield to take further action. He instructed the priory's custos, Richard del Clay, vicar of Lastingham, to make his way to Keldholme and there summon both de Holme and de Ebor' on the charge of being‚Äîin the Archbishop's words‚Äî\\"daughters of perdition\\". Del Clay was to denounce the two nuns‚Äî\\"in the mother tongue\\"‚Äîfor their disobedience before the collected convent. Further, instructed Greenfield, \\"they were not to meddle with any internal or external business of the house in any way, or to go outside of the enclosure of the monastery, or to say anything against the prioress, on pain of expulsion and of the greater excommunication\\". Archbishop Greenfield died in December 1315. This presented the discontented nuns with an opportunity to change prioresses again. Accordingly, Emma de Stapleton resigned in February the next year‚Äîin her words, \\"oppressed by age\\" and sickness‚Äîand Emma de Ebor' was re-elected in her place. For the second time in Keldhome's recent history de Ebor' succeeded de Stapleton as prioress, in what amounted, says Burton, to a posthumous victory over Greenfield. Power has speculated that de Stapleton's reason for resigning was not so much her age as the fact that she was intimidated into doing so: age may well have been \\"something of a euphemism; her reason doubtless took a concrete and menacing shape and wore a veil upon its undiminished head\\". Aftermath The Registers and Episcopal records make little mention of Keldholme Priory after the election dispute until the house was closed in 1536 by the dissolution of the monasteries. Assessment The historian Martin Heale has described the situation at Keldholme between 1308 and 1309 as an example of the \\"considerable friction\\" the imposition of a perceived outsider could cause within an enclosed community. Power has suggested that it illustrates the dangers of internal strife spreading beyond the priory's walls and impacting on neighbouring society. Janet Burton concurs, noting that it demonstrates that both the person of the prioress and her election were clearly of great interest to the wider community as well as the priory, between whom there was clearly a \\"close interaction\\". Valerie Spear suggests this is most likely because the position of prioress was a coveted one for local women. Also influential, says Spear, was the fact that, as small priories were generally extremely poor, they often had to rely on charitable donations from the community to clothe and feed the nuns; this in turn doubtlessly \\"emboldened\\" locals to interest themselves in the nuns' business \\"to the point of downright interference\\". Burton has called it \\"one of the most spectacular\\" disputes to affect early medieval religious houses. She also questions Archbishop Greenfield's supposition that there was no nun at Keldholme willing or able to be prioress; perhaps, she suggests, there were too many candidates, and the election dispute was a power struggle between them. It also suggests, she wrote, that female resistance to male authority was not as unknown as might have been presumed: \\"the Archbishop had stated that there were no nuns at Keldholme capable of holding office. The nuns clearly disagreed\\".

On the folk circuit, Shea befriended Gordon Lightfoot, for whom he played lead guitar between 1965 and 1975. Shea was a ‚Äúpivotal figure‚Äù in Lightfoot‚Äôs early career, according to music journalist Jerry LeBlanc. His guitar solo in a live performance recording of Canadian Railroad Trilogy at Massey Hall in 1969 is particularly notable.Martin, Sandra. ‚ÄúRed Shea, 70.‚Äù The Globe and Mail, The Globe and Mail, 1 Dec. 2016, www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/red- shea-70/article25579859/.

It is hosted by conservationist and television personality Forrest Galante, who travels to different locations around the globe to learn about possibly extinct animals and whether or not there is a chance that they may still be extant. The series has been involved in the possible rediscovery of eight animals, namely the Zanzibar leopard, the Pondicherry shark, the Fernandina Island Gal√°pagos tortoise, the Miller's grizzled langur, the Cape lion, the Malagasy hippopotamus, the Yangtze giant softshell turtle, Rio Apaporis caiman, whitetip weasel shark, ornate sleeper-ray and the flapnose houndshark .https://www.newsweek.com/shark-not-seen-over-100-years- rediscovered-1524094  Cast   Reception   Notable case findings  During filming for the show in 2018, a camera trap caught apparent footage of a Zanzibar leopard on Unguja Island. The animal appeared smaller than specimens from the mainland, and seemed to have smaller, more solid spots than normally seen on African leopards. Further investigations are planned in order to confirm whether or not this is a Zanzibar leopard, and whether a viable population still exists. During the shooting of a Shark Week special on the island of Sri Lanka, Forrest's wife Jessica discovered a pair of deceased sharks that had previously been killed by fishermen. Although one of the sharks turned out to be a bull shark, DNA testing of the second specimen suggested that it could be a Pondicherry shark, a species that hadn't been seen since 1979. Although some regional experts are confident that the shark found in the episode is a Pondicherry shark, additional molecular confirmation is needed before the shark's identity can be confirmed. While shooting footage for Season 2 on the remote Gal√°pagos Islands chain in February 2019, the team discovered a single female Fernandina Island Gal√°pagos tortoise, presumed extinct since 1906. Members of the Turtle Conservancy later analyzed the findings, saying that pending genetic confirmation, the photos \\"almost undoubtedly\\" show the lost animal. The tortoise was described as being ‚Äúin good health‚Äù but ‚Äúunderweight,‚Äù and was transported to the Fausto Llerena Tortoise Breeding Center in Isla Santa Cruz for the purpose of conservation and genetic tests. Trace evidence found on the expedition indicated that more individuals likely exist in the wild, and new searches were being planned to find a male Fernandina Tortoise that could potentially save the species. Washington Tapia-Aguilera, biologist at the Galapagos Conservancy and director of the Giant Tortoise Restoration Initiative, disputes the events of the rediscovery as portrayed. While shooting footage for Season 2 on the island of Borneo in April and May 2019, the team caught five pieces of footage on a camera trap overlooking a mineral spring that clearly showed the Miller's grizzled langur, presumed extinct since 2011, at both day and night. While shooting footage for Season 2 in Zimbabwe in 2019, the team collected DNA samples from an abnormally large lion that had recently been sighted in the area. Upon analyzing the DNA, the male was found to have 14% different DNA from a typical African lion, suggesting that it may have remanent genetics from the Cape lion population, which went extinct in the 1800s. The team theorizes that, through continued breeding, a pure Cape lion might one day be brought back. While shooting footage for Season 2 in Madagascar in 2019, the team, along with primatologist and biologist Cortni Borgerson, found a non- fossilized skull and tusk that were conclusively identified as belonging to a Malagasy hippopotamus, an animal that was believed to have gone extinct 1,000 years ago. However, the skull was dated to less than 200 years old, confirming that the species survived much later than previously believed and may have even survived into the present day. While shooting footage for Season 2 at Dong Mo Lake in Vietnam in 2019, the team, along with members of the Asian Turtle Program (ATP), captured footage of a Yangtze giant softshell turtle, a functionally extinct species with only three known surviving individuals, surfacing from the lake for a brief period. Although efforts to bring a surviving female of the species to the lake to possibly breed with the individual recorded in the episode failed due to her death in April 2019, the team hopes that their findings could contribute to a possible rescue of the species from extinction. While shooting footage for Season 2 in Colombia, the team caught and collected confirmed DNA samples from multiple individuals, including juveniles, of the Rio Apaporis caiman, a subspecies of Spectacled caiman that had been believed to be extinct for over 30 years, suggesting that a healthy breeding population may exist in the area. In addition to the rediscovery of the animal, the DNA evidence collected shows that the Rio Apaporis caiman diverged from its closest relatives around 5 to 7 million years ago, which, when combined with several unique morphological features (blotchy yellow pattern, elongated snout, etc.), suggests that the animal is actually its own separate species of caiman instead of a subspecies. Forrest Galante is currently working on a paper to describe the Rio Apaporis caiman as its own unique species. A Colombian scientist named Sergio Balaguera-Reina had rediscovered the caiman prior to Galante's excursion and published a paper on it in 2019. Balaguera-Reina further disputes the claim that the caiman was believed to be extinct, saying, \\"We never thought that this caiman was extinct. But the political situation in Colombia prevented biologists from safely accessing the animal‚Äôs habitat to confirm that it‚Äôs still there.\\" The portrayal of this finding has been questioned by related researchers as a case of parachute, or colonial, science claiming credit for previous work by in- country scientists. While shooting footage for \\"Land of the Lost Sharks\\" in South Africa with shark expert Dave Ebert, the team caught and collected three lost shark species, the first was a Whitetip Weasel Shark, found on footage captured on an underwater camera trap. The Ornate Sleeper-ray was found by footage captured by a South African dive master Adrian Peartan, who filmed it on a night dive, while it was feeding. Late at night Forrest and Dave managed to reel in a Flapnose Houndshark, a species not seen since 1902, tag it with a GPS tracker and release it back into the ocean to study its movement patterns, revealing its very restricted range,https://www.newsweek.com/shark-not-seen- over-100-years-rediscovered-1524094  Episodes   Season 1 (2018)   Season 2 (2019)   Specials   Criticism  Galante, as host of the Extinct or Alive series, has been described by the scientific community as ‚Äúa made-for-TV biologist: Crocodile-Dundee-style hat and all.‚Äù Galante is seen negatively by ecologists as the archetype for a parachute ‚Äúscientist‚Äù. A parachute scientist refers to a foreign scientist who drops into a country they don‚Äôt live in, makes use of local infrastructure, talent, and resources, then returns to write a paper, or take credit for the work of local scientists. Galante has been falsely credited with the discoveries of several species. With no discernible scientific or peer reviewed publications to his name as of 2019, and accusations of appropriation of other scientists' rediscoveries and rediscoveries (e.g., Rio Apaporis caiman and the Fernandina giant tortoise), Galante‚Äôs practice of parachute science and colonialistic science is considered extremely damaging to the field of ecology.

It was founded by Lydia Maria Child. Publishers varied over the years, but the original publisher was John Putnam. Sarah Josepha Hale edited the magazine as a monthly between September 1834 and April 1836. History The magazine was founded in 1826 by Lydia Maria Child. She supervised its bimonthly publication between September 1826 and August 1834. Child's interest in abolitionism and the publication in 1833 of her antislavery book, An Appeal in Favor of that Class of Americans Called Africans, led to Child being socially shunned. Subscriptions to the magazine dropped off. Child left her editorial position. Child wrote in the magazine to child readers when leaving the magazine in 1834: \\"After conducting the Miscellany for eight years, I am now compelled to bid a reluctant and most affectionate farewell to my little readers. May God bless you, my young friends, and impress deeply upon your hearts the conviction that all true excellence and happiness consists in living for others, not for yourselves. ... I intend hereafter to write other books for your amusement and instruction; and I part from you with less pain, because I hope that God will enable me to be a medium of use to you, in some other form than the Miscellany.\\"American children's periodicals, 1821-1840: The Juvenile Miscellany Content The magazine's content emphasized middle class Protestant values. It featured poems, stories, puzzles, and informative articles. The magazine was didactic. It provided amusement and imparted moral lessons while avoiding the piety so common in children's literature of the period. The magazine was ground-breaking. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature writes, \\"The calm security of the lives of the children in the stories, the affection they receive, and their childishness were something new in American writing.\\" The writers who contributed to its pages included Eliza Leslie, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, Lydia Huntley Sigourney, Hannah Flagg Gould, Sarah Josepha Hale, Caroline Howard Gilman, and Anna Maria Wells. Child herself contributed as \\"Aunt Maria\\". Response The magazine was hugely popular. Within four months of its debut, the magazine had 850 subscribers. While stories stressed the Protestant ethic, they were never boring. Caroline Healy Dall wrote in the Unitarian Review in 1883: > \\"No child who read the Juvenile Miscellany ... will ever forget the > excitement that the appearance of each number caused. ... The children sat > on the stone steps of their house doors all the way up and down Chestnut > Street in Boston, waiting for the carrier.

Most off-road trailers are associated with Overlanding, the self-reliant exploration of remote locales where the journey is as important as the destination.  Types of Off-Road Trailers   Caravan  Hard-sided, all living space, and storage are contained inside the trailer. it can have slide-out space such as an outdoor kitchen or gallery.  Pop-Up  A small compact trailer is designed as storage with slide-out features for kitchen or additional storage. Living space is packed down for travel and expanded for camping. Living space can be a pop-up or out that extends from the trailer.  Tear Drop  While some teardrop trailers are not off-road specific many teardrops are designed with rugged tires, sturdy materials,and suspension flexibility to be taken off the pavement. All storage and living space is contained inside the trailer. Most models have the kitchen outside with a separate door or opening.  Military/Utility (M416/M101)  Retired military trailers are built to withstand rough terrain and conditions often associated with combat zones, which makes them overbuilt for most off-road travel. The trailer is often used as storage and a roof top tent is typically placed on the top. Trailer models range from 3/4-2-ton payload and were made in a variety of bed configurations.  Features  An off-road trailer has a very distinct difference from a normal pull-behind trailer. An off-road trailer can be taken on a rough trail or road that is only accessible with a 4x4 or AWD vehicle. The trailer will also have several recovery points. The ground clearance is higher than a standard trailer. Frame and body are made of durable lightweight materials. Tires will be all-terrain, mud or off-road made from a thick durable material that is not easily punctured.  Additional articles  Why Off-Road Trailers Are All The Rage.

It is housed in the old Turtle Creek Pump Station, a landmark building that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It opened in 1988. The organization assists local performing artists, arts groups, and efforts related to arts education. It houses 14 arts organizations that represent different disciplines of performing arts. Over 90 other organizations use the center for rehearsals, performances and other events. As of 2019, Joanna St. Angelo serves as its executive director with Michael Cook serving as assistant director.  History  The Turtle Creek Pump Station building was designed by Dallas architect C.A. Gill and completed in 1909. The Pump Station was responsible for the entire water supply for the City of Dallas until 1930, when a much larger treatment plant was opened and the Turtle Creek Pump Station was shut down. In 1953, the building's west wall and chimney were removed due to industrial road renovations and the building was remodeled. The building was abandoned in 1959. In 1981, the City of Dallas leased the building to an arts support group in Dallas led by Jo Kurth Jagoda, which was known as the \\"Turtle Creek Center for the Arts\\". That same year, it was named as an American Water Landmark. In 1983, renovations started. The building was named a Texas Historic Landmark & State Antiquities Landmark. In February 1988, renovations were completed and the building was opened. The Center was given the name the \\"Sammons Center for the Arts\\" in honor of Charles A. Sammons and his wife, who donated funds in 1987 to complete the renovations. In 2011, the Center received a gift of $2,000,000 from Sammons Enterprises as part of a $5,000,000 fundraising campaign. In 2018, the Center's Director, Joanna St. Angelo, was awarded the inaugural Jac Alder Award by the Dallas Area Cultural Advocacy Coalition.  Spaces in the Center  The largest space in the building, Meadows Hall, was built for rehearsals, auditions, concerts, receptions, meetings, dances and fundraising events. It has a 35-foot ceiling and a footprint of approximately 2,800 square feet, with a seating capacity of up to 300 people. It is equipped with a high-quality hardwood floor for dancing, acoustical treatments and paneling, and a Steinway B grand piano. Kurth Hall hosts recitals, performances, meetings, theater, workshops, and special events. It has a footprint of approximately 1,200 square feet, seating up to 150 people for performances or lectures. This space is also equipped with acoustic treatments, hardwood flooring, vaulted ceilings, and a Steinway L grand piano. The Anne Sammons Cree Mezzanine Suite serves as a venue for receptions, meetings, workshops, luncheons, and other special events. The Suite is 1,200 square feet in area, and can accommodate an audience of 150. The Conference Room accommodates meetings, seminars, retreats and conferences.  Events  The Center regularly hosts jazz and cabaret concerts. Concerts are presented in the Meadows Hall and the Kurth Hall. * Sammons Jazz, founded in 1989, is a jazz performance series that showcases local jazz players in Big band, Bebop, Swing, and Latin styles. Since the Center was opened, Sammons Jazz has hosted over 250 jazz concerts. * Sammons Cabaret is a New York-style cabaret performance series founded in 2012. * The Sammons Discovery series was launched in 2016 to showcase the music of North Texas. Multiple genres are included, such as mandolin orchestras, jazz harp ensembles, percussionist and guitarist performances.

The altarpiece survived a huge fire in the church nineteen years after its installation as well as a wave of iconoclasm in 1566. Both Philip II of Spain and Elizabeth I of England tried to buy the work, but Maerten de Vos managed to convince the town council to buy the work to prevent its going abroad. It was briefly shown in the city's town hall before being placed on the Besnijdeniskapel altar in its original cathedral in 1590 - that chapel was used by the city's magistrates. During the French Revolution the Antwerp-based painter Willem Herreyns prevented the work from being publicly auctioned and taken to Paris by the French occupying troops. In 1798 it was transferred to the √âcole Centrale des Deux N√®thes. At that time the painting, its marble base and two copper covers were valued at 600 florins by the French commissioner.

He has lived and worked in Germany since the 1970s.  Life and career  Bangs earned a diploma in Communication Studies from the Polytechnic of Central London (PCL), now University of Westminster. His career began at BFBS Germany, where he presented from 1975 to 1989, first on Sundays, and from about 1981 at Saturday nights in the music programme Night Flight, which didn't fit into any standard drawers. Appropriate to the late broadcasting hours, the show typically included rather quiet pieces by John Fahey or Ry Cooder, but also Kevin Coyne or Neil Young. In the late 1970s, he was one of the first to include interpreters such as Television or Patti Smith. For a short term he hosted a second BFBS programme The Modern Dance (named after Pere Ubu's first LP), in which this new kind of music was given a forum. Since 1977 he reached greater notoriety as a presenter of the television programme Rockpalast in WDR and the Rockpalast Nacht in the ARD. In 1984 and 1985, on Mondays he presented the programme on WDR regional television. He was also active on WDR radio, first on WDR 2, and then on WDR 1 in 1986. There, Bangs presented numerous new records - especially from the independent sector and from the emerging alternative-country genre (like Green on Red, Gun Club, Cowboy Junkies, Lucinda Williams), which was rarely found elsewhere in the radio broadcasting landscape. If he liked a record very much, he was not shy to play up to six pieces from the record in a two-hour programme. From the 1980s on in WDR radio, Bangs moderated his Alan Bangs Connection originally on Saturdays, later on Tuesdays. From the end of 1985, he provided WDR's contribution to the joint ARD night programme ARD-Rocknacht. However, due to its musical content this programme was not taken over by Bayerischer Rundfunk, which met with much criticism. At the end of 1989, when Nachtrock programme for the was being reformed, Bangs did not agree with the new guidelines of this programme; he got out of the ARD night programme and since 1990 returned under the broadcast name Alan Bangs Connection back into the programme of WDR 1. In April 1995, WDR 1 was reformed to become the \\"youth wave\\" 1Live. This was met with vehement criticism. The former daily musical theme programmes broadcast between 22 and 24 o'clock were discontinued without replacement, only Alan Bangs Connection \\"survived\\" on a new slot at Sundays from 23 to 1 o'clock under the new title \\"Nachtflug\\" in 1995. However, Bangs idea of themed music radio was not compatible with the environment of the new channel: 1Live was a \\"formatted\\" channel with a focus on a young target group, but Bangs did not want to exclude any particular musical style from broadcasting. In the 17/18 September 1995 show, he played \\"\\" by Jacques Brel, followed by a short piece of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin which led to a song by Einst√ºrzende Neubauten. This caused WDR to release him at short notice and almost without comment from all his duties. Alan Bangs no longer won any presentation contracts from WDR afterwards. Among other things, this was followed by engagements with the broadcasters NDR, Sat.1, VH-1 Deutschland and in particular with live concerts \\"Ohne Filter\\" at ARD. Since 2000 he presented on each month with a fifth Friday (four times in 2012) the two-hour show \\"Nachtsession\\" on Bayern 2. In June 2003 he presented Rockpalast live from Rock am Ring. From 4 April 2010 Alan Bangs presented on internet and digital radio (DVB-S and DAB) radio programme DRadio Wissen the programme Nightflight at Sundays at 23 clock. In June 2013, DRadio Wissen announced that it would discontinue the programme in order to develop its music programme \\"in a different direction\\". In the corresponding commentary blog of DRadio Wissen this decision was repeatedly criticized by many listeners, but without avail. The last Nightflight show of this series was broadcast on 15 December 2013.  Presentation style  To counter conventional format radio, Alan Bangs strives for more creativity in programmes: In Alan Bangs Connection, he put up relationships of various kinds between the songs he played (e.g. only cover versions, only unplugged, certain years of publication, certain names or terms in the title, produced only by a specific person etc.). He once played only cover versions of Fever for an entire hour. He was often compared to John Peel for his carefreeness, courage, and open-mindedness. His BFBS broadcast has long been adjacent to John Peel's Music on BFBS. In moderation style, however, Bangs differed substantially from Peel, who made no lengthy comments about the music he played and did not make connections between several pieces or concepts for entire broadcasts.  Trivia  Alan Bang's personal record collection includes over records. In the mid-1980s, around records were stolen from his home during a break-in. During a broadcast at BFBS Radio 1 in Cologne, Bangs had previously mentioned that he would go on vacation.

Personal and family life Born on August 9, 1864, Roman Aguirre hailed from Lezo, Aklan section of Capiz. He was a tailor and drummer by occupation and was residing in Kalibo poblacion. As a tailor he was the best in town. In his hands passed the uniforms of many associations of the time: the white suit of the cuadrilleros (the policemen) and the linggons of the guardia civiles (civil guards). He was also a skilled drummer of the local band. He had a big heart for the oppressed and the helpless, but his fists were fast as the sticks of his snare drum against the haughty, the high and the mighty. Roman Aguirre's relatives called him Oma. Others called him Bugoy which means tough guy. He had a penchant for brawling. It is said he developed fever if he failed to feature in a fight for a long time. It's in his blood. He was only of regular Filipino height and build. To Roman Bugoy, anybody reputed to be another fighter or trouble-maker was a challenge. Once there was a famed rouge in the neighboring town of Banga by the name of Vicente Alba. Alba had also heard of Bugoy in Kalibo. Each now wanted to have a chance to fight the other. They met during a fiesta in Banga. The Kalibo band was assisting and was marching down the street and Roman was beating the snare drum. Then Vicente came around and each suspected the other as his long morn foe. Bugoy struck first by beating Vicente's head with his drum stick. They boxed and wrestled and rolled on the dust and down a muddy ditch until the cuadrilleros arrived to stop them. That's how they knew each other and that's the beginning of a long intimate friendship. Bugoy hated persons in authority. One time when he was drunk, he beat the chief of police and it took four cuadrilleros to subdue him. They tied him with a rope and had a bamboo pole pass through his tied arms and legs hog-fashion to bring him to the municipal jail. But Oma was very loving to his family. He had his moments of piety too. Sometime before his death, which came all too unexpectedly, he said to his wife, ‚Äúlya, it is at my age when our Lord Jesus died. He was also thirty- three.‚Äù Roman left behind nine small children. The youngest was five years old. He could have left them riches as he was the best tailor and drummer in town. But, no. He said his children might only quarrel over inheritance. They would have to sweat for their living if they had to survive. And so he drank and gambled. Entry into the Katipunan When the Katipunan called for recruitment, Roman Bugoy enlisted into the society. He marched with the troops into Kalibo poblacion the day Del Castillo fell. When the forces disbanded, he was made to hide in a barrio in Lezo. But he clamored, ‚ÄúI do not know how to hide. I'd rather fight.‚Äù He was alone in hiding because his family stayed in Lezo poblacion. The night news reached Lezo that the insurrectos from barrio, Liloan swooped down Malinao poblacion, four kilometers away from Lezo, and killed the pr√©sidente municipal, it was pandemonium in Lezo. Without any strong male to depend on to protect the family in the face of the threatening danger of rebel raid from Malinao, Eulogia, Roman's wife, dragged her brood back to their home in Kalibo the following day, where situation under the Spanish authorities was still relatively peaceful. Surrender for Amnesty Learning of the departure of his family to Kalibo, Roman left his hideout and went after them. But he stayed outside the poblacion in barrio Guba across the Aklan River. The next day, a bandillo announced Colonel Monet's amnesty urging the rebels to report and be pardoned. Antonia, 16, accompanied by her little sister Irene, 7, both daughters of Roman, went to see. their father in Guba and tearfully persuaded him to come to town and present himself to the authorities. Roman reprimanded the children and told them to go back and tell their mother that he would not present himself as he had a hunch that the amnesty was just a ruse. At noon, Antonia again returned to her father, saying that it was the priest himself who gave the assurance in a church sermon of the sincere intention of the Spaniards, and that so many insurrectos in fact had already surrendered. Her effort was again in vain. At 6:00 o‚Äôclock that afternoon, when Antonia went back the third time, Roman gave in to a tearful daughter's plea. He came to town and, with his wife and children, he reported dutifully at the municipal building. Since it was already evening, Roman was allowed to go home and was advised to report the following day to formalize his surrender. When they returned the following day, Roman was detained and his family sent home. Hundreds of rebels who reported that day were detained. Suspected leaders of the uprising were picked out, segregated and confined at the Azarraga warehouse. Roman was among those detained, because the authorities had known him to be a perennial trouble-maker. It was enough reason. They spent the night of March 21 as prisoners incommunicado. Their fate was sealed the following day in the connivance of the local leaders with the Spanish officials. At 4:00 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon they were herded to church and made to take confession. When they were brought back to the warehouse, Roman sent for his family. Eulogia and the children were barely allowed to see him. When they were finally permitted, Spanish marines who accompanied them rested a rifle at every shoulder of each child as they approached the prisoners‚Äò quarters. Seeing his wife and children thus, the once stout-hearted fighter fell on his knees and broke down in tears. He clasped his youngest child, the petite Ana, but soon a Spanish marino told him to let go the child, and bade the family to depart. Death Roman, as a parting word to his wife, said that it was bruited that they would be shipped to Capiz the following day where other prisoners had been brought. That was the last they saw of Roman alive. The following day when the nineteen dead were laid on the plaza before the tribunal, all red with their own blood, Irene, Roman's daughter, upon seeing the corpses, not knowing that her father was one of them, ran home and told her mother: \\"Inay, many camineros are lying down on the plaza. They are in their red uniform.‚Äù Legacy The mortal remains of the 19 martyrs were relocated to a mausoleum in 1926 now known as Aklan Freedom Shrine or locally known as Castillo. In order to commemorate the death anniversary of the 19 Martyrs of Aklan, Republic Act No. 7806 was made into law setting the 23rd day of March of every year as a special public holiday in the Province of Aklan. A former general himself, President Fidel V. Ramos let Republic Act 7806 lapsed into law without his signature. And on September 1, 1994, in accordance with Article VI, Sec. 27(1) of the Constitution became law. The street where they were massacred earlier known as Amadeo Street in Kalibo is now known as XIX Martyrs Street, in their honor. His relatives in Kalibo, Aklan named a building after him. Ramon Aguirre Building is located in corner XIX Martyrs and Pastrana Streets, Kalibo, Aklan. On the 102nd martyrdom anniversary of the 19 Martyrs of Aklan on March 23, 2018, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines officially turned over to the Provincial Government of Aklan a tableau memorial in honor of the freedom heroes at the Goding Ramos Park.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses radio frequency waves to generate images of the human body. Radio frequencies at non-ablation energy levels are commonly used as a part of aesthetic treatments that can tighten skin, reduce fat by lipolysis and also apoptosis, or promote healing. RF diathermy is a medical treatment that uses RF induced heat as a form of physical therapy and in surgical procedures. It is commonly used for muscle relaxation. It is also a method of heating tissue electromagnetically for therapeutic purposes in medicine. Diathermy is used in physical therapy to deliver moderate heat directly to pathologic lesions in the deeper tissues of the body. Surgically, the extreme heat that can be produced by diathermy may be used to destroy neoplasms, warts, and infected tissues, and to cauterize blood vessels to prevent excessive bleeding. The technique is particularly valuable in neurosurgery and surgery of the eye. Diathermy equipment typically operates in the short-wave radio frequency (range 1‚Äì100 MHz) or microwave energy (range 434‚Äì915 MHz). Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF) is a medical treatment that purportedly helps to heal bone tissue reported in a recent NASA study. This method usually employs electromagnetic radiation of different frequencies ‚Äì ranging from static magnetic fields, through extremely low frequencies (ELF) to higher radio frequencies (RF) administered in pulses. History The idea that high-frequency electromagnetic currents could have therapeutic effects was explored independently around the same time (1890‚Äì91) by French physician and biophysicist Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval and Serbian American engineer Nikola Tesla.J. W. Hand,\\"Biophysics and Technology of Electromagnetic Hyperthermia\\" in d'Arsonval had been studying medical applications for electricity in the 1880s and performed the first systematic studies in 1890 of the effect of alternating current on the body, and discovered that frequencies above 10 kHz did not cause the physiological reaction of electric shock, but warming., translated by J. H. Kellogg He also developed the three methods that have been used to apply high-frequency current to the body: contact electrodes, capacitive plates, and inductive coils. Nikola Tesla first noted around 1891 the ability of high-frequency currents to produce heat in the body and suggested its use in medicine. By 1900 application of high-frequency current to the body was used experimentally to treat a wide variety of medical conditions in the quack medical field of electrotherapy. In 1899 Austrian chemist von Zaynek determined the rate of heat production in tissue as a function of frequency and current density, and first proposed using high-frequency currents for deep heating therapy. In 1908 German physician Karl Franz Nagelschmidt coined the term diathermy, and performed the first extensive experiments on patients. Until the 1920s noisy spark-discharge Tesla coil and Oudin coil machines were used. These were limited to frequencies of 0.1 ‚Äì 2 MHz, called \\"longwave\\" diathermy. The current was applied directly to the body with contact electrodes, which could cause skin burns. In the 1920s the development of vacuum tube machines allowed frequencies to be increased to 10 ‚Äì 300 MHz, called \\"shortwave\\" diathermy. The energy was applied to the body with inductive coils of wire or capacitive plates insulated from the body, which reduced the risk of burns. By the 1940s microwaves were being used experimentally. In 1926 William T. Bovie discovered that RF currents applied to a scalpel could cut and cauterize tissue in medical operations, and electrosurgery generators or \\"Bovies\\" have been used in surgery ever since.

DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. DNA is a polynucleotide as it is composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides; when double-stranded, the two chains coil around each other to form a double helix. In natural DNA, each nucleotide is composed of one of four nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound to each other with hydrogen bonds, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), to make double- stranded DNA. Hachimoji DNA is similar to natural DNA but differs in the number, and type, of nucleobases. Unnatural nucleobases, more hydrophobic than natural bases, are used in successful hachimoji DNA. Such a DNA always formed the standard double helix, no matter what sequence of bases were used. An enzyme (T7 polymerase) was adapted by the researchers to be used in vitro to transcribe hachimoji DNA into hachimoji RNA, which, in turn, produced chemical activity in the form of a glowing green fluorophore. New base pairs DNA and RNA are naturally composed of four nucleotide bases that form hydrogen bonds in order to pair. Hachimoji DNA uses an additional four synthetic nucleotides to form four types of base pairs, two of which are unnatural: P binds with Z and B binds with S (dS in DNA, rS in RNA). :{! colspan=\\"2\\"Base !!

Biology Scripps Research chemist Floyd Romesberg, noted for creating the first Unnatural Base Pair (UBP), and expanding the genetic alphabet of four letters to six in 2012, stated that the invention of the hachimoji DNA system is an example of the fact that the natural bases (G, C, A and T) \\"are not unique\\". Creating new life forms may be possible, at least theoretically, with the new DNA system. For now, however, the hachimoji DNA system is not self-sustaining; the system needs a steady supply of unique building blocks and proteins found only in the laboratory. As a result, \\"Hachimoji DNA can go nowhere if it escapes the laboratory.\\" Applications NASA funded this research to \\"expand[s] the scope of the structures that we might encounter as we search for life in the cosmos\\". According to Lori Glaze of the Planetary Science Division of NASA, \\"Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA's planetary science missions, and this new work [with hachimoji DNA] will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for.\\" Research team leader Steven Benner notes, \\"By carefully analyzing the roles of shape, size and structure in hachimoji DNA, this work expands our understanding of the types of molecules that might store information in extraterrestrial life on alien worlds.\\" According to researchers, hachimoji DNA could also be used \\"to develop clean diagnostics for human diseases, in DNA digital data storage, DNA barcoding, self-assembling nanostructures, and to make proteins with unusual amino acids. Parts of this hachimoji DNA are already being commercially produced by Firebird Biomolecular Sciences LLC\\".

Critics compare her painting to art spanning almost two centuries, suggesting qualities of both historical consciousness and contemporaneity; representative works such as Mary Larkin's Bottom (2013), for example, are often compared to those of early 19th-century painter J.

It is not to be confused with the Castleford Whitwood Stadium or the Sandy Desert ground used by Castleford Tigers, which was on the west side of Lock Lane. Origins The stadium was built on the north bank of the River Aire and on the east side of Lock Lane and was known as the Lock Lane ground in its early days. The ground hosted an early Castleford rugby football team that played Leeds Parish Church RFC in 1888. The team was probably Castleford RFC (1896). Athletics and cycling The ground hosted cycling, athletic and charity sports events up until World War I. Rugby Union With the formation of the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU) in 1895 the ground was used by both the Castleford rugby league team and Castleford rugby union team. The following year in 1896 the Northern Union team moved east to west to a new ground across the opposite side of Lock Lane. In 1928 a newly formed rugby union team played fixtures at the ground. Rugby league The ground continued to be used as a rugby league ground by Castleford RFC, up until when they folded in c.1906. Football By 1907 Castleford Town F.C. were using the ground to play their football matches. Castleford and Allerton United football club also used the ground at a later date. Castleford Town moved out to play at Wheldon Road but disbanded in 1928 but reformed in 1933 and played at the Lock Lane ground again. After they disbanded for a second time in 1937 redevelopment plans as a greyhound track were proposed. Greyhound racing The stadium was duly redeveloped as a greyhound stadium and lasted from c.1939 to c.1950. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) With a capacity of 1,500 it is known to have traded up until 1950 and possibly beyond.

She is the co-founder and director of Intelligent Textiles, who create wearable technology including e-uniforms for infantry.  Early life and education  Peta-Thompson studied fashion at Birmingham City University. She enjoyed crochet and knitting. She joined Central Saint Martins for a master's degree in textile design. She worked with a special needs school to develop textiles that could be used to support children with autism. She developed a wheelchair cover with textile pressure sensors that could prevent pressure sores.  Career  Peta-Thompson develops electronic textiles. In 2002 she joined Brunel University London as a research fellow working on products for people with disabilities. Peta-Thomspon was based in the Brunel Design for Life Centre, where she began to work with industrial design lecturer Stanley Swallow. Together the pair developed a Talking Waistcoat, which included fabric sensors, for people suffering from cerebral palsy. Peta-Thompson was not convinced by the bulky electronic devices that people with cerebral palsy had previously used, and began to explore conductive thread. The waistcoat included sensors that allowed people with cerebral palsy to access computers. Whilst demonstrating their product at a European trade show, Peta-Thompson and Swallow met Australian Wool Innovation, who were interested in working with organisations that could use Australian wool. They began to manufacture conductive fabrics using a weaving mill that belonged to John Lewis & Partners. In 2002 they formed a spin-out company Intelligent Textiles Limited. Intelligent Textiles Limited has partnered with Lincoln Fabrics, a Canadian factory, as well as a weavers in Lancashire to manufacture their materials. At first they operated out of a small studio in London, working with a clothing company to integrate an MP3 player into a jacket. Peta-Thompson learnt that soldiers have to carry over 60 AA batteries and often suffer from tangled charging cables. Instead, Intelligent Textiles Limited looked to develop electronic textiles that could be retro-fitted into military uniform. They own over 17 patents and several trademarks. Limited Peta-Thompson pitched their idea, Broadsword, to the Canadian Armed Forces. The United States Army and United States Marine Corps also became interested. They were supported by BAE Systems and the Centre for Defence Enterprise. Their e-uniforms significantly reduce the weight carried by infantry, and went into trials in 2015.

Purdue Pharma, and by extension some members of the family, have faced criticism and lawsuits regarding overprescription of pharmaceutical drugs, including Oxycontin, and Purdue Pharma's role in the North American opioid crisis. According to the New Yorker, Purdue Pharma played a \\"special role\\" in the opioid crisis because the company \\"was the first to set out, in the nineteen- nineties, to persuade the American medical establishment that strong opioids should be much more widely prescribed‚Äîand that physicians‚Äô longstanding fears about the addictive nature of such drugs were overblown.\\" History The Sackler family are descendants of Isaac Sackler and his wife Sophie (n√©e Greenberg), Jewish immigrants to the United States from Galicia (now Ukraine) and Poland, who established a grocery business in Brooklyn. The couple had three sons, Arthur, Mortimer, and Raymond Sackler who all went to medical school and became psychiatrists. They were often cited as early pioneers in medication techniques which ended the common practice of lobotomies, and were also regarded as the first to fight for the racial integration of blood banks. In 1952, the brothers bought a small pharmaceutical company, Purdue-Frederick. Raymond and Mortimer ran Purdue, while Arthur, the oldest brother, became a pioneer in medical advertising and one of the foremost art collectors of his generation. He also gifted the majority of his collections to museums around the world. After his death in 1987, his option on one third of that company was sold by his estate to his two brothers who turned it into Purdue Pharma. In 1996 Purdue Pharma introduced OxyContin, a version of oxycodone reformulated in a slow-release form. Heavily promoted, oxycodine is seen as a key drug in the emergence of the opioid epidemic. Elizabeth Sackler, daughter of Arthur Sackler, claimed that her branch of the family did not participate in or benefit from the sales of narcotics. While some have criticized Arthur Sackler for pioneering marketing techniques to promote non-opioids decades earlier, Professor Evan Gertsman said in Forbes magazine, \\"It is an absurd inversion of logic to say that because Arthur Sackler pioneered direct marketing to physicians, he is responsible for the fraudulent misuse of that technique, which occurred many years after his death and from which he procured no financial gain.\\" and In 2018, multiple members of the Raymond and Mortimer Sackler families, Richard Sackler, Theresa Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Jonathan Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, and Ilene Sackler, were all named as defendants in suits filed by numerous states over their involvement in the opioid crisis. The family was first listed in Forbes list of America's Richest Families in 2015.

The family also supported universities, including Harvard University, the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, Columbia University, Tufts University, New York University, the Royal College of Art, the University of Sussex, and the University of Edinburgh. The Sackler Faculty of Medicine at Tel Aviv University is named after Arthur, Mortimer, and Raymond Sackler for their donations. Similarly, the Sackler Institute of Pulmonary Pharmacology at King's College London was named after Mortimer and Theresa Sackler. The Sackler family name, as used in institutions which the family have donated to, saw increased scrutiny in the late 2010s over the family's association with OxyContin. David Crow, writing in the Financial Times, described the family name as \\"tainted\\" (cf. Tainted donors). In March 2019, the National Portrait Gallery and the Tate galleries in the UK announced that they would not accept further donations from the family. This came after the American photographer Nan Goldin threatened to withdraw a planned retrospective of her work in the National Portrait Gallery if the gallery accepted a ¬£1 million donation from a Sackler fund. In June 2019, NYU Langone Medical Center announced they will no longer be accepting donations from the Sacklers, but have yet to change the name of the Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. Later in 2019, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, each announced they will not accept future donations from any Sacklers that were involved in Purdue Pharma. On July 1, 2019, Nan Goldin, an American photographer, the founder of P.A.I.N., led a small groups of protesters who unfurled a banner \\"Take down the Sackler name\\" against the backdrop of the Louvre's glass pyramid.In 2018, Goldin went public with her rehabilitation process to overcome her opioid addiction. Goldin was prescribed OxyContin after breaking her wrist. Goldin established P.A.I.N.|Prescription Addiction Intervention Now (P.A.I.N.) through which she used social media activism to contrast the Sackler family's cultural philanthropy with their role in inflamming the opioid crisis as owners and managers of Purdue Pharma who manufactured and marketed OxyContin. P.A.I.N. also protested that the Sackler family have never taken responsibility for their role in the opioid crisis. Previous P.A.I.N protests took place in Sackler Wing's Temple of Dendur at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2018, at the Guggenheim Museum in 2019. In February 2019, Goldin issued a statement saying she no longer would participate in the planned retrospective of her photography, which was to be exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in London if the Tate did not refuse the Sacklers most recent donation of ¬£1 million. According to The New York Times, the Louvre in Paris was the first major museum to \\"erase its public association\\" with the Sackler family name. On July 16, 2019 the museum had removed the plaque at the gallery entrance about Sacklers‚Äô donations made to the museum. Throughout the gallery, grey tape covered signs such as Sackler Wing, including signage for the Louvre's Persian and Levantine artifacts collection, which was removed on July 8 or 9. Signage for the collection had identified it as the Sackler Wing of Oriental Antiquities since 1997. Opioid lawsuits In 2019, a suit was brought in the Southern District of New York, which included more than 500 counties, cities and Native American tribes. It named eight family members: Richard, Jonathan, Mortimer, Kathe, David, Beverly and Theresa Sackler as well as Ilene Sackler Lefcourt.\\"New York Sues Sackler Family Members and Drug Distributors\\", New York Times, March 28, 2019.

They are most destructive in wooden homes, and are agricultural pests in the tropics and subtropics of Africa and Asia. Nests Their underground nests form a slight mound above ground, which may be covered in grass. In large colonies, the mounds may be up to in diameter, and may be covered by shrubs and trees. Some species construct open chimneys or vent holes that descend into the mound. The fungal garden is enveloped by a thick layer of clay. Castes The queen is imprisoned in a clay cell in the midst of the fungal garden at the center of the hive. The African species have a single soldier cast, unlike the related genus Macrotermes. Food Their only food is the fungus grown in the fungal garden at the center of the nest. The fungus is cultivated on a substrate of wood, bark, leaf litter, dry dung, and dead grass. These are plastered with cement where they are obtained, which facilitates diurnal foraging. Odontotermes species are major contributors to litter decomposition.

The game was released for the Nintendo Switch in January 2019. Gameplay In Double Cross, the player controls Zahra Sinclair, an agent of RIFT who can jump, wall-jump, and use her proton slinger to grab certain objects or get across wide gaps via anchors, and also has a number of combat-based moves such as punching, rolling to parry attacks and obstacles, and healing herself. By defeating enemies, Zahra can obtain energy that fills an energy meter, which is used up in some of her combat moves. Zahra also gains new combat moves by collecting enough Upgradium in each level to level up; leveling up also allows Zahra access to certain equippable upgrades of which she can only hold three at a time. The game's visual style is presented through 2D vector character sprites and environments. There are a grand total of thirteen levels in the game, with four levels in each of the three worlds, and one final level that is only unlocked once all three worlds are cleared and certain other conditions are met. Though the levels in each world are structured linearly, the player may complete each world in any order they wish barring the final level, similar to the Mega Man series. The first three levels of each world are unlocked by normal progression, but to reach the fourth and final level of each world as well as the final level, the player must gather clues by completing requests for other characters, completing certain levels, or simply checking various areas in the RIFT headquarters, to gather a complete case file to send to Commissioner Valerie Wiseheart. Each world has a distinct gameplay mechanic that is interspersed into its levels. Plot Double Cross takes place in a world where interdimensional travel is possible. However, as this has led to negative consequences such as crime and contamination between worlds, a police force led by Valerie Wiseheart and Dash Sterling known as Regulators of Interdimensional Frontiers and Technology (RIFT) serves to maintain law and order between each dimension, with Zahra Sinclair being one of RIFT's top agents. One day, a mysterious figure referred to as \\"Suspect X\\" steals the Metacatalyst, a weapon said to be majorly destructive, from the Extraverse. When Zahra arrives to stop him, \\"X\\" tells her to \\"leave RIFT\\" before escaping. Using the clues she obtained while confronting \\"X\\", and with the help of her coworkers, Zahra tracks \\"X\\"'s activities to Reptarria, the Funderdome, and Gootopia. Zahra clears the trials of each world and respectively defeats crime bosses Ripjaw, Hancho, and even RIFT's own Freya Gronnalva, narrowing down her suspect list; as she does this, Zahra runs into a counterpart of herself who despises both \\"X\\" and RIFT because of an incident where \\"X\\" destroyed her world, and is herself horrified at RIFT's corruption. Zahra eventually narrows down her suspect list to her best friend, Skip Hollister, much to her chagrin. After Zahra faces off against Rogue Zahra one last time, it is revealed that the real \\"X\\" had framed Skip to commence his invasion of the RIFT headquarters and overheat the station core. With some help from Skip, Zahra confronts \\"X\\", who is revealed to be a counterpart of Dash. RIFT's Dash then enters the scene, and reveals that he had staged the whole heist to get revenge on RIFT (especially strict director general Sorgina DeLabourde) for not treating his terminally ill son, the one person he loved more than anyone else in any universe. Zahra fights both Dashes with much difficulty; however, Rogue Zahra appears at the last moment and allows RIFT's Zahra to gain the upper hand, defeating the Dashes and foiling their scheme. Zahra is later promoted to elite agent to ensure RIFT is reformed, and celebrates with the other agents as Rogue Zahra thanks her counterpart for helping come to terms with their differences. In a post-credits scene, an army of the remaining Dashes decide to enact revenge on behalf of their jailed counterparts. Development Double Cross was announced on April 3, 2018, and was originally slated for a Summer 2018 release. Due to an overhaul in the gameplay and art style, the release date was pushed forward to January 2019. Reception Double Cross received mixed to somewhat positive reviews upon its release. Critics lauded the platforming aspect and the varied level design, but heavily criticized the mystery-solving aspect and the combat structure, which many believed to be dull and repetitive. On Metacritic, the game holds a score of 67 based on 22 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Heidi Kemps of GameSpot gave the game a 6/10, calling the proton slinger mechanic \\"special\\" and \\"a lot of fun\\", praising the move's effectiveness and especially the time slowdown, but found the combat \\"a sluggish, simplistic affair\\", concluding \\"Had Double Cross opted to focus more on its strength--fun physics platforming--and de- emphasized things like combat and the tedious mystery-solving element, the game would have been an easy recommendation. But the weak parts of the package drag down the whole, and Double Cross winds up feeling like it's a somewhat undercooked mash of ideas.\\" Matthew Zawodniak of Nintendo World Report gave the game a 7/10, similarly praising the platforming and calling it \\"the 2D Spider-Man game I've always wanted\\", but was also similarly critical of the combat and the generic story, concluding \\"Double Cross is almost great. With all the different ways to use the proton slinger in this game, I definitely had a blast progressing through the levels. Unfortunately, the investigation and combat sections make for such dull interruptions that at least a third of your time spent as an agent of R.I.F.T. will be a forgettable slog. I‚Äôd love to see a sequel take the proton slinger and really run with it because there‚Äôs a lot of potential the game leaves hanging.\\" References External links * Category:2019 video games Category:Action video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Platform games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Double Cross (video game)"},{"id":"60040447","text":"Peter Robert Leggett (16 December 1943 ‚Äî 2 November 2016) was an English footballer who played as a right winger.

The game is scheduled to be played on November 21, 2021 at Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton, Ontario. It will be the 11th time that Hamilton has hosted the Grey Cup, with the most recent coming in 1996, and the first to be played at the new Tim Hortons Field.  Background   Host city selection  The 108th (2020) and 109th (2021) Grey Cup were awarded to Regina, Saskatchewan and Hamilton, Ontario respectively on February 21, 2019. Litigation over the construction of Tim Hortons Field was settled on May 31, 2018, which had prevented the Tiger-Cats from bidding on a Grey Cup game prior to then. The game was originally awarded as the 109th Grey Cup; the 2020 CFL season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, marking the first time the Grey Cup was not awarded since 1919. Date It was speculated with the 108th Grey Cup that the date for this game could come at least one week sooner than in previous years. Currently, the Grey Cup is played on the fourth or fifth Sunday of November, as has been the case since 2007. During the CFL's State of the League address on November 24, 2017, League Commissioner Randy Ambrosie suggested that the league could potentially move the date to the third week of October. On November 23, 2018, Commissioner Ambrosie confirmed that the league schedule would start one week earlier, suggesting that the 108th Grey Cup game would be on November 15, 2020. However, in the dual 2020 and 2021 announcement, it was revealed that the earlier start meant that it would be played on the third Sunday of November, which is still the earliest start since the November 19 game in 2006.

Hawaii Wildlife Fund, No. 18-260, 590 U.S. ___ (2020), was a United States Supreme Court case involving pollution discharges under the Clean Water Act (CWA). The case asked whether the Clean Water Act requires a permit when pollutants that originate from a non-point source can be traced to reach navigable waters through mechanisms such as groundwater transport. In a 6‚Äì3 decision, the Court ruled that such non-point discharges require a permit when they are the \\"functional equivalent of a direct discharge\\", a new test defined by the ruling. The decision vacated the ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and remanded the case with instructions to apply the new standard to the lower courts with cooperation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Background The Clean Water Act (CWA), enacted in 1972 as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972,United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. . October 18, 1972. regulates water pollution into \\"waters of the United States.\\"Clean Water Act (CWA) sec. 301(a), . One of its provisions involves the regulation of pollutants from point sources (such as the drainage from an industrial plant) into surface waters. Operators of any point source are required to obtain a permit through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) that limits what pollutants may be emitted by the point source, necessary treatment steps to take to limit those pollutants, and other considerations.CWA sec. 402, . It is unclear whether the Act covers discharges into waters of the U.S. through groundwater. A plain reading of the statute indicates that it does, \\"The term \\"discharge of a pollutant\\" and the term \\"discharge of pollutants\\" each means (A) any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source, (B) any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft.\\"CWA sec. 502, . Whether the CWA covers fairly traceable discharges through groundwater into navigable waters of the U.S. was the fundamental question of the Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund appeal before the United States Supreme Court. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) directly regulates discharges into groundwater aquifers, such as through injection wells, and additional regulations set by each state. The EPA still regulates the type of wastewater that can be injected through the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program, but broadly, the UIC Program allows much higher levels of pollutants to be injected compared to the NPDES, due to the natural filtration action that occurs in groundwater aquifers. Of particular interest to the case are Class V UIC wells‚Äîwells used to dispose of non- hazardous water waste into underground aquifers. Typically these will include stormwater drainage or agricultural runoff. The EPA estimates there are 650,000 such Class V wells in place across the United States. Map of the northwestern shore of the island of Maui, highlighting the location of the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility and its proximity to the shoreline In the present case, the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility in Maui County, Hawaii treats wastewater from homes and businesses. The facility is authorized by the EPA and the Hawaii Department of Health under the SDWA to inject the reclaimed water into four Class V wells on the island, with an average total effluent of per day. Because of the geologic nature of Hawaii, it was estimated that more than 90% of this water eventually enters the surrounding ocean through seepage. During the planning and subsequent reviews of the facility, both the EPA and the state had determined that there was no need for the facility to apply for a NPDES permit, since it was not a point source under the CWA. However, work done by University of Hawaii at Manoa proved that approximately 60% of the injections of wastewater from the Lahaina facility were reaching nearby ocean waters via groundwater using tracer dye studies to track the destination of the wastewater, and piezometer studies observed heightened levels of nutrients at the site. Trial court In 2012, several environmental activist groups, including the Hawaii Wildlife Fund, the Surfrider Foundation, the Sierra Club-Maui Group, and the West Maui Preservation Association, represented by Earthjustice, sued the county for lacking appropriate NPDES permits, arguing that their injection wells were truly point sources since past EPA studies using dye tracers had shown it possible to trace the discharge from individual wells into the ocean. Reclaimed water, which can possess higher levels of bacteria and other microorganisms, that seeped into the ocean led to the spread of algal blooms near Maui's shores and could impact the health of coral reefs, aquatic and mammalian life, and humans that live near the shore, according to the environmental groups. The County disputed this with support of the EPA, stating that the wells were not a direct point source defined from the CWA. The suit was filed after the environmental groups plead with the county on civil grounds to seek an NPDES permit in the years prior. In 2014 the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii found for the plaintiffs, agreeing that the facility needed NPDES permits for the injection wells and for the facility itself. Appeal The county appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which also ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in 2018. The Ninth Circuit's decision drew on Rapanos v. United States (2006), in which the plurality decision authored by Justice Antonin Scalia suggested that permits would be required even for point source pollutants that \\"do not emit 'directly into' covered waters, but pass 'through conveyances' in between.\\" The court claimed that the plain language of the CWA supported the requirement that the discharge from the wastewater plant be subject to permit, held that the Clean Water Act required a permit when pollutants were \\"fairly traceable\\" to the original point source. This was a novel test for the CWA, rejecting two standards proposed by the County and the EPA. In the specific case of the Maui wastewater plant, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the pollutants from the wells to the ocean that resulted in pollution concentrations above de minimus levels was \\"fairly traceable\\" and thus would need a permit under the CWA. The Ninth Circuit concluded that \\"at bottom, this case is about preventing the county from doing indirectly that which it cannot do directly\\". The court declined to hear the case en banc. During the early parts of the case, the EPA, under President Barack Obama's administration still had upheld the initial statements that there were no need for permits for these types of wells, but had been working with environmentalists to devise new standards. With the election of Donald Trump in 2016, the EPA took a stronger stance against the environmentalist position, and in April 2019, after the trial court and appellate court decisions, issued a new guidance document asserting that the CWA does not cover such discharges. This document is not binding on the Supreme Court. Regardless of the outcome of the case, the County agreed to pay a fee to the groups should they prevail in the challenge, and are working on developing more projects in Maui to use more of the reclaimed water produced by the plant for beneficial uses as to minimize any seeping to the ocean. Supreme Court The County filed its petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, arguing that the test proposed by the Ninth Circuit for defining a point source discharge conflicted with the Supreme Court's prior ruling in South Florida Water Management District v. Miccosukee Tribe (2004). and upheld in several subsequent cases. The County also raised concerns that this test would affect a significant portion of the other 650,000 Class V wells in operation, requiring these wells to also obtain NPDES permits. The County also referred to the Supreme Court's decision in Michigan v. EPA (2015), which stated the EPA failed to consider the costs necessary in what it considered a \\"necessary and appropriate\\" rule-making change to enforcement of the Clear Air Act that affected the nation's power plants.. The County believed that the new point source test from the Ninth Circuit would be a similar economic burden. The Supreme Court approved the petition in February 2019. Oral arguments before the Supreme Court were held November 6, 2019. The Justices debated with the legal representatives on the impact of a ruling in either direction. A ruling that favored the county of Maui could potentially allow wastewater dischargers to simply modify how their wastewater is discharged with minimal cost to avoid EPA's regulations, while a ruling favoring the Wildlife Fund could leave many smaller property owners, including home owners, at fault for unintentional leaks of wastewater from their properties. Decision The Court issued its 6-3 decision on April 23, 2020, which vacated the Ninth Circuit's decision and remanded the case to the lower court.Cnty. of Maui v. Haw. Wildlife Fund, . Majority opinion and concurrance Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Brett Kavanaugh. In his opinion, Breyer wrote that the \\"fairly traceable\\" test that the Ninth Circuit had adopted would give the EPA greater authority on pollutant regulation than Congress had given at the time, as the Ninth Circuit's test could apply to a source of pollution that may have occurred a century before and hundreds of miles away due to the slow motion of groundwater. However, the decision also outright rejected the County of Maui's argument that the discharge in the present case did not need a permit, as the language of the CWA as intended by Congress would cover the types of discharge. In the decision, Breyer asserted that a permit for discharge would be required for point sources, or for non-point sources, for \\"the functional equivalent of a direct discharge\\", which had been demonstrated in the present case. Breyer wrote as an example \\"Where a pipe ends a few feet from navigable waters and the pipe emits pollutants that travel those few feet through groundwater (or over the beach), the permitting requirement clearly applies. If the pipe ends 50 miles from navigable waters and the pipe emits pollutants that travel with groundwater, mix with much other material, and end up in navigable waters only many years later, the permitting requirements likely do not apply.\\" Breyer's opinion included two major factors to be considered in evaluating whether non-point source discharge was functionally equivalent to direct discharge: the distance that the pollutant must travel from the point of discharge to the federal waterway, and the time that it would take. Other factors that can impact this included the ground material that the pollutant traveled through, how the pollutant changed or interacted with other chemicals within the ground, and how much of the pollutant made it to the waterway. In his concurring opinion, Kavanaugh stressed that the majority opinion was consistent with Rapanos. Dissenting opinions Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch. Thomas took the stance that the CWA was more restrictive and only required a permit from a true direct discharge source, and would have reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision in favor of the County of Maui. Justice Samuel Alito also wrote a dissent, more critical of the majority opinion setting a new standard for determining the need for a permit, but would have also reversed the Ninth's decision. Impact Breyer instructed the Ninth on remand to consider the \\"functional equivalent\\" test, in guidance with the EPA, to re-evaluate the discharge from the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility and for similar cases going forward, barring a change in the CWA statute from Congress. This would thus determine if the original case brought by the Hawaii Wildlife Fund could then proceed. The decision is also expected to led the EPA to develop specific rules related to the \\"functional equivalent\\" test to be set in place after public review. Additionally, several pending cases filed by environmentalists against wastewater plants and oil processing companies related to their water discharge are expected to be re-evaluated in light of the majority decision. The decision was generally seen as a favorable outcome for environmentalists, though the test proposed by Breyer was narrower than what environmentalists had proposed. The decision also rejected the attempt by the Trump administration to remove any type of permit requirements on these sites, as well as rejecting the EPA's attempts to bypass parts of the CWA statute. Other industry sectors such as the chemical and energy sectors feared that this will require a review of their waste discharge, which had previously determined the need for permitting under bright-line rule, with new, vague guidelines set by the Supreme Court.

Turnbull also highlighted affinity bias as a related factor, such as involving corporate hiring practices; while affinity bias was indicated to not be exclusive to dominant culture (i.e., culture of white men), in dominant culture, interviewers who showed a biased preference for candidates that were similar to them (e.g., candidates who are ‚Äúlike‚Äù the interviewer, candidates who make the interviewer feel ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù) were showing an affinity bias; thus, the interviewer may also possess an unconscious bias toward candidates dissimilar to them (e.g., candidates who are ‚Äúnot like‚Äù the interviewer, candidates who make the interviewer feel ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù) possess an unconscious affinity bias. She further adds the factor of assimilation, which she defined as the ‚Äúneed to adjust our style to fit within the dominant organizational and/or cultural norms‚Äù; the listed subcomponents of assimilation were feedback (e.g., feedback involving affinity bias, feedback involving group stereotypes operating in concert with confirmation bias, feedback that ignores the positives and presents ‚Äúdevelopment opportunities‚Äù through the lens of one's own culture, race, or gender), distancing (e.g., distancing oneself from one's own social identity group), and collusion (i.e., adjusting one's own style to ensure that one is kept politically safe and that members of the dominant culture are kept ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù). Furthermore, she underscored that unconscious and conscious messages, measures, and images of the dominant culture can have a negative impact upon individuals, and thus, lead to assimilation; with the internalization of these messages, measures, and images, she also highlighted that individuals can collude with the dominant culture, and thus, individually self-sabotage.  Race and ethnicity  Many European-Americans believe that the end of racism has been accomplished and that the United States is a color- blind country. While living in racial isolation (e.g., suburbs, gated communities, public/private schools, religious services, close associations that are primarily/exclusively with other whites), European-Americans are able to receive an abundance of work opportunities, schooling that translates to upward mobility, to have properties that appreciate in value, and live where crime is not generally a concern; this version of America then becomes projected onto the rest of the country. Their encounter with non-European America mostly occurs through television, where the range of stereotypes (e.g., criminal, athlete, success story) can be selected. Depictions of racial minorities in advertisements and token representations in important public and private positions reinforce the perception of racism having ended. The illegality of being able to discriminate on the basis of skin color (e.g., denying access to employment, housing, public accommodations) leads to color- blind conclusions that the social and economic disparities between racial groups are due to reasons other than racism or discrimination. Coupled with the ideology of neoliberalism, where the functions of the market have presumably rid society of racism's irrationality, colorblindness allows for European-Americans to view the inequalities of race as a consequence of cultural pathologies within racial minorities. Consequently, being able to set aside the historic and present-day racist practices that produce and racialize equality, European-Americans then are able to make the claim that African- Americans and other racial minorities are the ones who culturally construct their own disadvantages. The foundational conviction of the United States being a meritocracy, along with the combination of neoliberalism's presumed impersonal, nondiscriminatory, rational markets and colorblindness's presumed racial equality, composes the characterized racial and colorblind logic and viewpoint, or the illusion of inclusion, for European-Americans. Millions of enslaved Africans had their humanity, identity, culture, history, language, and religion taken from them. While divinely gifted to all, freedom in the United States of America was not given for enslaved Africans; rather, it was struggled for and earned in the successes of the American Civil War in 1865. Since the 1960s, following the civil rights movement and colonization of Africa, Africans have continued living in a state of survival, and have sought to restore the identity of Africans since enslavement. In the 1950s and 1960s, black America had faced many kinds of challenges (e.g., poverty, police brutality, unjust laws and legal system, grief and broken-heartedness due to killing of family members, fear among surviving members that they would be next to suffer or be killed). The Voting Rights Act of 1965 legally allowed for the US federal government to enforce the 15th Amendment (an amendment allowing black men legal right to vote) and 19th Amendment (an amendment allowing women, including black women, the legal right to vote) to the US Constitution in response to the various kinds of voting obstacles (e.g., poll taxes, identification laws, tests, death threats, death, maiming) facing the African-American community and required states to receive federal approval prior to changing their voting laws. Throughout the history of African- Americans, from enslavement to Jim Crow segregation, the challenges of black America have remained in varied form, but with the difference being that African-Americans were not under the illusion of inclusion then. In 2013, the US Supreme Court overturned significant aspects of the Voting Rights Act, which effectively granted states the power to create laws that weaken black America, allows for southern states previously under the voting rights purview of the federal government to cease being under federal scrutiny, and allows for the altering of legal voting boundaries, instituting of voting identification laws, and enacting of voting identification regulations. In 2015, the Republican-led US Congress did not cooperate with President Obama to support a legislation that was characterized as being able to restore the Voting Rights Act. Rather than be blinded by national politics and the illusion of inclusion, the importance of voting was emphasized, as control of the US presidency and US Congress, affects, not only national policies and relations, but international policies and relations as well. In a series on race and the illusion of inclusion in the United States of America, the ‚ÄúRules of Racism‚Äù were conveyed, via Hidden Colors III: The Rules of Racism. The ‚ÄúRules of Racism‚Äù were: keep what racism is confounding to all; conceal the contributions of blacks; black women and children are not exceptions to the effects of white supremacy; utilize compromising blacks to preserve white supremacy; keep blacks under mass control; diminish the importance and effects of enslavement and Jim Crow segregation; keep blacks from being able to economically compete by making policies. In response to these ‚ÄúRules of Racism‚Äù, challenges to the rules were then drafted by Monroe Community College‚Äôs Diversity Council: instruct others about what racism is; educate and publicize the contributions of blacks; oppose white supremacy (institutional racism); fight white supremacy by celebrating diversity; modify the outcomes society produces for blacks; amplify the importance and effects enslavement and Jim Crow segregation; challenge policies that keep blacks economically unable to compete. The issue of the illusion of inclusion and black Americans was addressed in regards to Barack Obama as an African-American president of the United States of America. The point of criticism made was of how an educated black American could possibly believe that an African-American president could bring forth meaningful change to a society, such as the United States; the United States has historically been in opposition to black Americans, where black Americans have had to struggle for equal rights, opportunity, and justice, and where race is still an important factor. For instance, a survey done by sociology professor Richard Schuman found that white Americans consider integration to be 15% black American, 85% white American, and always under the authority of a white American. Additionally, he stated that ‚Äúwhen White Americans say they favor integrated schools or neighborhoods, what they really mean is a few Black students or families in a predominantly white environment.‚Äù The concluding point was that a white supremacist society, rather than being able to be fundamentally changed by an individual, could only be changed by a group that is ‚Äúunited, alert, focused, determined and knowledgeable.‚Äù The inclusion of the African-American community in mainstream American life was characterized as mythical. African-Americans are recommended to not confuse symbolic power with actual power, and that they must confront the illusion of inclusion. Umar Johnson highlighted that African-American children are increasingly intelligent, and thus, increasingly know what works and what does not work; hence, a conventional prescription given by some adults to simply let the political process take its course to address issues (e.g., police brutality) of the African-American community, which has shown itself to be untrue, is a lie that will not solve the problem. Concerning the history of civil rights, he made note of civil disobedience having a relevant place in the African-American community, as from the struggle for freedom during enslavement, to the Civil Right and Voting Rights Acts, these came by way of breaking some laws. He also expressed disgust for the black community being duped by the illusion of inclusion and, consequently, fighting for every other group of people except their own. He concluded that, as demographic groups (e.g., Latinos, Arabs, GLBT) struggle for their own causes, African-Americans, as their own demographic group, must fight for their own and not everyone else. Most African-Americans, particularly African-American professionals, are considered to be engrossed in what Minister Louis Farrakhan called the illusion of inclusion. The illusion of inclusion was viewed as being initially made for house slaves, who were characterized as being the most comfortable among enslaved Africans and the easiest to persuade that they had a stake in preserving the status quo‚Äîan African servant-European master relationship, where the house slave was quasi- liberated and comfortable, and where treachery of African resistance was considered normal. During the 1960s and 1970s, African-American leadership sought civil rights, as opposed to sovereign rights, which was characterized as a situation akin to prisoners of war seeking decorations for their prison cells rather than prompt liberation. Rather than focus on the collective need for political and economic sovereignty, African-American leadership was focused on inclusion; consequently, despite the perceived drastic decline of the collective status of African-Americans, African-Americans, collectively, are characterized as remaining comfortable in their captivity and engrossed in the illusion of inclusion to the extent that they are unaware of their conceptual imprisonment. The prescribed solution for breaking the mental bonds of their conceptual imprisonment, comfortable captivity, and illusion of inclusion was to immerse themselves in the media (e.g., books, journals, magazines, CDs, videos, audio-tapes) produced by ‚Äúintellectual maroons‚Äù (e.g., Carter G.

KIPP: STAR College Preparatory Charter's eighth grade US history contained American traditions, customs and assumptions, which was characterized as an illusion of illusion, in terms of ethnicity and gender, as it was based on the presumption of a single viewpoint that had gaps. For instance, there was a view of Abraham Lincoln as the savior of the Union, along with the excluded understanding that Lincoln's major focus was to preserve the Union even if it that involved preserving slavery. In a knowledge-based global economy, which relies on a science and engineering workforce, the presumption that an increase in the amount of science and engineering degrees earned by African Americans are mirrored in the science and engineering faculty of colleges and universities was characterized as falling under the illusion of inclusion. The Council on Social Work Education‚Äôs standards have been criticized for their perceived impotence and vagueness, as they contain a pattern, characterized as diversity by numbers, where, representation in faculty, staff, student body, and curriculum has been a focus for groups, such as African-American faculty. With the desegregation of curriculum, personnel, and students, yet a remaining disinclination in the culture of white schools to prioritize equitable treatment and diversity, this is what is viewed as having established it as an illusion of inclusion. An African-centered solution was prescribed to resolve the problem of the illusion of inclusion. Demographic data has served as a justification for inclusion. With the exclusion of blacks and Latinos, inclusion eventually became a guiding principle in the civil rights movement. Since the 1960s, diversity has become associated with access and representation has become a relevant consideration. At California State University, Northridge, its characterized one-size-fits-all model produced its illusion of inclusion due to a perceived lack of substantive change being made in terms of power. In Rodolfo Rosales‚Äô The Illusion of Inclusion: The Untold Political Story of San Antonio, the topic of the illusion of inclusion was detailed. After World War II, when municipal reforms occurred in Sunbelt cities, such as San Antonio, and by the early 1980s, when many of these cities acquired council-district systems, this allowed for the increased representation of minorities in politics. With the Chicano community, via its middle class, which was the most active in the field of urban politics and well-situated to be a force for change, having successfully gained a significant position in politics, inclusion could be viewed as having been achieved. However, the underlying case was that the existing political system adjusted to the Chicano community, co-opted it, and its working class and poor continued to be socially and economically excluded. The difficulty has been in bringing about effective change in a pro-business, urban political environment and market economy, which are components of the Sunbelt city model. With the shift to the council- district systems, this produced a weakening effect upon parties and community- based organizations and strengthening effect upon individual politicians, as well as shifted the nature of politics from being organizational agenda-based to being personal agenda-based. As organizational agendas can mobilize a community, due to there being direct connection to that community, this allows for the development of community-oriented issues that serve the interests of the community (e.g., Chicano community). With there being a shift toward the predominance of personal agendas, which may be coincidentally community- oriented, this tends to result in a lack of community-oriented issues that can compete with the dominant political and economic priorities of Anglo businesses, thereby, allowing for priorities in the prevailing consensus to favor Anglo businesses. In California, 65% of the population are of Mexican ancestry, and 20% of the population are an Anglo minority. National City, as with other cities in California, has a large Chicano population, yet, like other cities, also has an Anglo minority that continues to control its economy, politics, and politicians. Despite being the majority population, the Chicano community has remained unrepresented, which reflects the reality of being an illusion of inclusion, if not an actual regression back to the 1960s. The Raza Unida Party was proposed as a solution for the illusion of inclusion. Rather than failing due to myths such as lack of enrollment, Chicano/a studies has been failing due to the monopolies (e.g., General Education, Electives) that white professors have on the university; white professors operate the university and distribute its benefits to university departments, and are increasingly defensive about their illegitimacy. Mexican students are half the size of the total student population, and there are 12,000 Latinos, yet are disproportionately represented among tenure track professors. Additionally, there are few courses that focus on Mexican experiences, which is an inequity that Chicano/a studies has sought to challenge. Los Angeles has changed, with the development of a Latino population of over 50% -- 80% of that more than 50% whom are of Mexican ancestry. In one instance, the racial disparity between Mexican American students and faculty was highlighted by a Mexican American professor, and, consequently, met with negative responses (e.g., discomfort with discussing race, ‚Äúunqualified‚Äù applicants should not be hired, not seeing color, the unimportance of race) from white professors, despite studies showing that the race and class backgrounds of professors affecting the questions students ask and research outcomes. Concerning the illusion of inclusion, statistics on Hispanic participation in the United States show that the US social system marginalizes and excludes Hispanics rather than integrates and includes them. In 2008, the US presidential election presented the rare opportunity to investigate race, class, and gender-related issues. Rather than interrogate the matrix of identity represented by the election's leading candidates, conventional biases and reductionist thinking about the matrix of identity (e.g., race, class, gender) facilitated the preservation of the illusion of inclusion. Race, culture and difference can be systemically centralized and obscured as the illusion of inclusion. The European Union reception system is perceived to be an illusion of inclusion system that marginalizes non-wealthy and vulnerable people, which forces them to engage in illegal and criminal activities.  Sex, sexuality, and gender  The Illusion of Inclusion: Women in Postsecondary Education highlighted the illusion of inclusion within the context of postsecondary education. Women of Canada have had limited access to higher education and unequal participation in comparison to men. Discrimination and marginalization of women on the campuses of Canada have occurred, spanning from the institutional to the interpersonal. It highlighted topics such as the risk of physical and sexual assault on campus, sexual harassment in classes and professors‚Äô offices, jokes of male professors and students being encouraged despite being racist, sexist, or homophobic in nature, a lack of female role models (e.g., professors) for women (e.g., Aboriginal women, black women), and insufficient attention given to female students by professors. Many cosmetic companies that once exclusively featured white women for their advertisements and as spokeswomen for their products have added light-skinned women of color. As part of the illusion of inclusion, the marketing strategy employed was characterized as being purposed for attracting women of color, who might feel alienated by products exclusively marketed by whites, via inclusion of a few light-skinned, women of color with Anglo-features; this allowed for the illusion of inclusion to be cast while simultaneously still promoting a message about the beauty of whiteness. The illusion of inclusion enables white feminists to retain white feminist racism in the feminist movement under the pretense of diversity. While there have been new rights and protections acquired for GLBTQ individuals in the United States, the model of inclusion and homonormativity has usually privileged well-to-do, white, homosexual men. Closer examination needs to be given as to how these progressive practices (e.g., practices in schools) serve to benefit some GLBTQ individuals, while serving to detriment other GLBTQ individuals, usually along the intersecting lines of race, gender, sexuality, and class. In particular, how power relations inform the concepts of GLBTQ ‚Äúinclusion.‚Äù Critical examination of inclusion and GLBTQ curricular resources has shown that GLBTQ inclusionary practices are actually limited and exclusionary; additionally, it has shown that these practices are essentially re-inventions of the existing power structures of oppression, and are parts of a greater project of homonationalism, which results in homonormative subjects being changed into ideal members of the country. Due to heteronormative bias and the illusion of inclusion in the gender paradigm, intimate partner violence tends to assume a male perpetrator and female victim. Perpetrators can be gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender.

He founded Lowel-Light, a manufacturer of highly portable lighting equipment used in TV, film and stage lighting, with 20 patents filed by Lowell. Lowell was the cinematographer for the Academy Award-winning short A Year Toward Tomorrow (1966), and he won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement in 1980 for his compact lighting system. The same year, he was nominated for Best Short Film, Live Action for his 14-minute film Oh Brother, My Brother (1979), depicting two of his young children. In 1987 Lowell was awarded the John Grierson Gold Medal by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), \\"in recognition of his many achievements, inventions, and innovative developments in the field of lightweight lighting and of grip equipment.\\" Lowell worked on hundreds of documentaries, short films and television commercials. From 1972 he taught stage lighting at New York University and various professional seminars, and in 1992 he wrote a book about lighting, Matters of Light and Depth. Early career Lowell was born in 1926 in New York City to Leo and Juliet Lowell. He joined the United States Navy to serve during and after World War II as a military photographer (1945‚Äì1946). He studied filmmaking at the University of California, Los Angeles, starting in 1948, then at the University of South Carolina in 1949. In 1955, Lowell was a student at a summer workshop at Haystack Mountain School of Crafts; his photographs from that time illustrate the 2019 book In the Vanguard: Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, 1950-1969. Lowell worked in the film and television industries as a cameraman, lighting director and cinematographer. Lowel-Light In 1957‚Äì1958, CBS documentary filmmaker Stephen E. Fleischman was producing an episode for Walter Cronkite's The 20th Century television series. The episode, titled \\"The Delinquents: The Highfields Story\\" (1959), included many scenes shot at Highfields, the former Lindbergh estate in New Jersey, where an experimental program was underway to rehabilitate juvenile delinquents. Fleischman hired Lowell to install a temporary and unobtrusive lighting system at Highfields, one which would stay in place for a few weeks of filming. Lowell invented a swiveling ball-and- clamp system for mounting lights, and he reworked Johnson & Johnson's Permacel duct tape product by combining the Permacel adhesive with a silver fabric backing to create gaffer tape which could hold a flat metal plate to a window. A ball joint attached to the plate could mount a small portable floodlight fixture. The gaffer tape would resist heat and stay in place for months without leaving a residue when removed. The \\"Delinquents\\" episode aired in January 1959, and Lowell started the Lowel-Light company later that year. Lowel-Light manufactured and sold the compact lighting solutions he had developed. The company was based out of his Stamford, Connecticut, home in the early days. The first products used high-intensity light bulbs which did not last very long, and there were few accessories. Over time, Lowel-Light introduced more accessories to create a portable lighting system for location photography.Industrial Photography 1983, vol. 42, p. A 1983 issue of the magazine Industrial Photography declared, \\"When Ross Lowell invented the original Lowel-light, he probably didn't have any idea that his small light would have such a big influence on the working habits of both still and film workers.\\" Lighting book In 1992, Lowell produced the instructional book Matters of Light and Depth: Creating Memorable Images for Video, Film and Stills Through Lighting, published by Broad Street Books of Philadelphia. The book, composed of topical essays organized into eight chapters, was recommended by photography lighting expert Jon Falk before it came out. John Jackman, in his 2004 lighting book Lighting for Digital Video and Television, cites Lowell's book as a \\"classic\\" of the trade, and quotes Lowell: \\"It is all too easy to confuse effects with effective lighting, startling images with unforgettable ones, quantity of foot-candles with quality of light.\\" Still photography Lowell's still photography work was exhibited twice in 2010. In May, his series titled \\"Time Trails\\" was shown at Pound Ridge Library. Five months later, a series of his works was shown outdoors at Ward Pound Ridge Reservation in New York, the exhibit titled \\"Forest of Possibilities\\". The 24 images, each enlarged to about and printed by National Geographic Imaging, were hung from trees in the forest of the nature preserve. Personal life Lowell was married four times. His first wife was the former Anita Kregal; they were married for ten years and had a daughter, Lisa. Lowell's third wife, Carol, bore him three sons: Josh (b. 1972), Evan (b. 1976), and Brett (b. 1980). Ross and Carol Lowell produced the 1979 short film Oh Brother, My Brother depicting Josh and Evan. On the \\"Acknowledgements & Dedications\\" page of his 1992 book, Lowell thanked New York flash photography author Jon Falk for introducing him to \\"publishers Ed Moran and Marilyn Shapiro of Broad Street Books.\\"Lowell 1992, p. 11 Lowell would later marry Marilyn. In 2007 through their film company Big UP Productions, Josh and Brett produced a film about rock climbing titled King Lines, which won an Emmy for best sports documentary. In 2019, Lowell's fourth wife Marilyn Shapiro-Lowell reported that he had died in Pound Ridge, New York, at the age of 92. He was survived by his four children, ten grandchildren, a sister and two nieces.

Sisauranon is mentioned by Procopius in the 6th century. On linguistic grounds, it is identified with the way-station Sarbane in the 5th-century Tabula Peutingeriana, and with the modern site of Sirvan on the Turkish‚ÄìSyrian border, whose name probably derives from the ancient settlement. The site is also variously mentioned as Sarbanon (œÑ·Ω∏ Œ£Œ±œÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩ·ø∂ŒΩ) in Theophanes the Confessor, Sisarbanon (œÑ·Ω∏ Œ£ŒπœÉŒ±œÅŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩœâŒΩ) in Theophylact Simocatta, and Sisara in Ammianus Marcellinus, as well as the variant forms of Sisaurion (Œ£ŒπœÉŒ±œçœÅŒπŒøŒΩ), Sisabranon (Œ£ŒπœÉŒ±Œ≤œÅŒ¨ŒΩœâŒΩ), Isauranon (·º∏œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒ±ŒΩ·ø∂ŒΩ) in various manuscripts of Procopius. The locality of Sambure in the Ravenna Cosmography may also refer to the same site. The fort lies on an artificial mound, some 545 m high, possibly of Bronze Age origin. As late as 2006, some of the fort's walls were still extant on the site, but the remains of Roman roads reported in 1927 appear to have vanished. Despite the small area of the present-day remains, which indicate a small fort, Procopius calls the site a œÄœåŒªŒπœÉŒºŒ±, indicating the existence of a small civilian settlement. The fortress passed into Sasanian hands in 363, and thereafter played a role in safeguarding the western Sasanian frontier against the Roman-Byzantine Empire. In 541, during the Lazic War, the Byzantine general Belisarius captured the fortress as well as its commander Bleschames and 800 Sasanian cavalrymen; they fought alongside the Byzantines in the Gothic War. In 589 during the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 572‚Äì591, general Comentiolus captured it once again. The Roman fortress of Rhabdion (modern-day Hatem Tai Kalesi, Turkey) is located on the steep slope just 6.5 kilometers to the north-west of Sisauranon.

She was launched in 1866 and wrecked in 1889. She was one of the first ocean-going steamships to provide regular service to the northwest coast of North America.  Construction  Idaho was built in Bath, Maine and launched on August 11, 1866. She was a wooden ship, built of oak, yellow pine, and hackmatack. She was 198 feet (60 meters) long, with a beam of 31 feet (9.4 meters), and a draft of 17 feet (5.2 meters). She displaced 1,077 gross tons. Her primary propulsion was provided by a coal-fired steam engine which had a single 44\\" cylinder and a 3' stroke. The engine turned a fifty-six foot-long shaft to drive a single propeller 12 1/2' in diameter. She also had two masts and could sail. One report said she cost $250,000 to build. She was built in the shipyard of George F. and John Patten, a partnership between two brothers. As originally constructed, her interior spaces included forty three-berth staterooms, a dining salon which could seat 100, a ladies' cabin, and a gentlemen's smoking room. An 1880 refit gave slightly more space for cargo, reducing cabin capacity to 100 and steerage capacity to 125 people.  Anchor Line (1867)  By 1865 a cosy duopoly existed between the California Steam Navigation Company and the California, Oregon, and Mexico Steamship Company for sailings from San Francisco to points north. The duopolists charged $45 for a cabin and $25 for a steerage berth on the San Francisco - Portland route. Captain Jarvis Patton founded a competing steamship company, the Anchor Line, to challenge the duopoly. He began service with his new ship, Montana, and cut rates to $15 for a cabin and $5 for steerage. The two existing competitors dropped their prices in response, hurting profitability for all. The Anchor Line's second vessel, Idaho, sailed from Maine for the West Coast on October 5, 1866 under the command of Captain Patton. She stopped in Montevideo and sailed from there on November 22, 1866, reaching San Francisco on February 8, 1867. She made one run to Portland for the Anchor Line. Her arrival on the West Coast and the greater competition the new ship heralded, triggered industry consolidation. The ocean-going fleet of the California Steam Navigation Company was merged into the California, Oregon, and Mexico Steamship Company in June 1867. The Anchor Line was absorbed as well, eliminating competition on the San Francisco - Portland route. Rates were immediately raised to $35 for a cabin and $20 for a steerage berth.  California, Oregon, and Mexico Steamship Company (1867 - 1870)  Despite the change in ownership and rates, Idaho continued to sail between San Francisco and Portland in the immediate aftermath of the merger agreement. She was switched to the San Francisco - Honolulu route in mid-1867 and continued to sail to Hawaii until mid-1870. During this period, in March 1869, the California, Oregon and Mexico Steamship Company was reorganized as the North Pacific Transportation Company. The company changed from a New York corporation with headquarters in New York City to a California corporation with headquarters in San Francisco.  Pacific Mail Steamship Company (1870 - 1875)  In October 1870 Idaho was chartered by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company to replace its ship Continental, which sank off Cabo San Lucas. She sailed from San Francisco to Mazatlan to replace Continental, and later to a number of other destinations including Panama, Portland and San Diego. There was over-capacity and vigorous competition on these routes, driving down profitability for all shipping companies. Idaho was idled in August 1874 to reduce costs. The steamship industry consolidated again in 1875 when five of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company ships were sold to Goodall, Nelson, and Perkins Steamship Company which focused solely on coastal trade in North America, leaving the longer international voyages to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. It is unclear when Idaho became part of the Goodall, Nelson, and Perkins fleet, but one source relates that it was part of the larger 1875 deal. In any case, the next time California newspapers report her as assigned to a regular route was late 1877 under the flag of the Pacific Coast Steamship company.  Pacific Coast Steamship Company (1875 - 1888)  When partner Chris Nelson retired in October 1876, Goodall, Nelson, and Perkins Steamship Company was reorganized as the Pacific Coast Steamship Company. The company spent $70,000 to renew Idaho and assigned the ship to her old San Francisco - Portland route in November 1877. After a refit which refreshed her interior spaces in August 1880, she began sailing between San Francisco, and Victoria, B.C. with stops in Puget Sound at Port Townsend, Seattle, Tacoma, Steilacoom, and Olympia. She made the round-trip in 18 days or so depending on the weather. Part of the commercial attraction of the northern route was the general development of the economy of the Northwest, but the Cassiar gold rush in British Columbia also brought substantial new trade to the region. Her cargo from San Francisco headed north tended to be manufactured and processed items. For example, cargo bound for Victoria on Idaho's September 11, 1881 sailing included 8 cases of hats, 220 barrels of flour, 7 rolls of leather, 5537 pounds of tea, 5 cases of tobacco, 9 cases of fuse, 14,507 pounds of sugar, 55 barrels of whiskey, 80 coils of rope, and 540 pounds of opium. Cargo on the return voyage from the Northwest was primarily gold from the Canadian mines and raw agricultural commodities. For example, Idaho returned to San Francisco with $10,451 of Canadian gold on June 4, 1880. She sailed from Puget Sound with 4,000 sacks of oats on September 30, 1880. Cruising to Alaska became popular among vacationers in the early 1880s, and gold mining began in earnest in Juneau in 1881. With these two new demands for shipping, the Pacific Coast Steamship Company assigned Idaho to the Alaskan trade. She sailed From Port Townsend for Harrisburg (now Juneau), Sitka, and Fort Wrangell for the first time on July 1, 1882. The ship made stops in Victoria and Nanaimo, British Columbia en route, the latter for coal. She sailed this route year-round except for trips back to San Francisco for maintenance for the next five years. The route was a success for Idaho. In fact, the Summer 1886 cruise season to Alaska was so popular that the ship was cited for carrying 215 passengers on one trip, 15 more than she was licensed for at the time. One of these was the Chief Justice of the United States Morrison Waite. Similarly, success of the Juneau gold mines continued the demand for transport of mining machinery and goods to Alaska. In February 1887 Idaho carried $60,000 in gold bullion south from the mines. In late December 1885, Idaho arrived back in Port Townsend from Alaska. Between three and four- hundred pounds of undeclared opium was found aboard and the ship was seized by customs officials. Opium was not illegal at the time, but it was subject to high import duties. Idaho was seized for violations of these revenue laws. Her owners posted a $30,000 bond to free the ship pending a forfeiture hearing. Captain James Carroll, claimed to have no knowledge of the smuggling, but subsequent events throw this claim into question. After the seizure of Idaho, the U.S. Revenue Cutter Oliver Wolcott was dispatched to a cannary controlled by Carroll in Kasaan Bay, Alaska. Fourteen barrels, labeled as furs and landed from Idaho, were opened and found to contain 3,012 pounds of opium. The size of these seizures suggested to contemporary observers that this smuggling business had been underway for a long time. Nonetheless, Captain Carroll continued to sail for the Pacific Coast Steamship Company. The ship was condemned at its forfeiture hearing, but the decision was appealed so Idaho continued her normal runs to Alaska. Issues with opium smuggling recurred during Idaho's service on the Alaska route. It was alleged at the time that the ship would pick up the drug, produced in the Far East, in Victoria. She would either transfer it to ships in Alaska sailing directly for San Francisco, or carry it back to a U.S. port itself, in either case avoiding high U.S. duties. On June 12, 1887 45 pounds of undeclared opium were seized from Idaho in Portland. On August 1, 1887, 67 pounds of undeclared opium were seized from Idaho's dirty laundry at Portland. On November 1, 1887 104 pounds of smuggled opium were seized from Idaho at Port Townsend, parts hidden in a lifeboat, the propeller shaft alley, and in the ship's butcher shop. On January 26, 1889 $1,000 of opium was found hidden inside the cabin walls of the ship. Idaho was not alone in this affliction as smugglers sought numerous routes to avoid U.S. customs duties. Idaho had her share of accidents during her long career. On the evening of November 8, 1879 a southeast gale blew into San Francisco Bay. Despite having two anchors set, Idaho dragged across the bay grounding near Potrero Point. When the tide went out, her bow was five feet higher than her stern. Her damage was substantial. She was refloated, repaired, and cleared by marine surveyors to resume service in April, 1880. On November 24, 1888 Idaho was caught by a gale in Queen Charlotte Sound. She was driven aground and lost her main mast, most of her standing rigging, and part of her keel. She went into drydock in Victoria. Repairs which were completed on December 11, 1888 and she resumed her schedule to Alaska. In late September 1886 Idaho was on the other side of a maritime accident. She was dispatched to search for the Ancon, another Pacific Coast Steamship Company vessel on the Alaska route, which was two-weeks overdue. On October 27, she found the Ancon, now under the command of James Carroll, which had been seriously damaged by grounding. She took off Ancon's passengers and returned them to Port Townsend while Captain Carroll salvaged Ancon.  Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (1888 - 1889)  On April 20, 1888 Idaho was chartered to the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. The railroad put her back on her original Portland - San Francisco route. The railroad used the steamer to complete trips to San Francisco for its rail passengers and cargo without having to pay for the use of competitors rails. The new venture was a success for the Oregon Railway and Navigation company, so it chartered a second ship, City of Topeka. The company expanded its through-rates to Puget Sound and British Columbia ports to compete with the Northern Pacific Railway without paying it for the use of its tracks.  Loss of Idaho Wreck of the Idaho, probably from 1889 or 1890 Idaho sailed from Port Townsend bound for Portland at 3 AM on November 29, 1889. The fog in the Strait of Juan de Fuca was heavy, and Captain L. E. Angerstein steered toward the sound of the fog signal at the Race Rocks lighthouse. Sadly, at some point the fog signal stopped sounding. When it resumed, the ship was too close to avoid Rosedale Reef and she hit the rocks roughly amidships. The hull was pierced and the ship began to flood. At the time of the grounding, her cargo was 150 barrels of fish oil, 370 barrels of salmon, 65 bales of hops, 200 tons of coal, and most problematically, 800 barrels of lime. The lime began to react with the seawater and burst into flame. The crew threw many of the barrels overboard and drilled holes in the hull to let in more water to drown the rest. The entire cargo deck was flooded to extinguish the fire. While the fire was out, Idaho remained firmly grounded. The extensive flooding and exposed location of the ship suggested that she could not be saved. Formal salvage efforts began on December 1, 1889 and 892 separate items were removed including her anchors, chain, boats, windlass, a cannon, a piano, and various bits of furniture, crockery, and bedding. The wreck of the Idaho itself, was sold to the Pacific Coast Steamship Company for $500. She was dislodged by a strong gale and floated free. Ironically, she may have gained enough buoyancy to escape the rocks because everyone assumed she could not. The tons of anchors, chain, and other materials that were taken off might have made the difference. She was spotted drifting in the Strait of Juan de Fuca on the morning of December 20, 1889. She was taken in tow by a succession of vessels and finally reached Port Townsend where she sank.

He earned his PhD at Cambridge, where his dissertation was on Viking longboats.  The Oracle at Delphi  He is an expert on the ancient religion and modern science of geological fumes at the ancient site of the Delphic Oracle in Greece, and has spoken on the topic widely. His research, along with that of geologist Jelle Zeilinga de Boer, has demonstrated that the psychoactive gas ethylene seeped from under the oracular site, and would have led to an \\"altered mental status\\" by the Pythia, the prophetess-priestess of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Later research has further supported the geological fumes theory. Professor Hale's research on the geological fumes theory is recounted in The Oracle: Lost Secrets and Hidden Message of Ancient Delphi, by science writer William Broad. It was also featured in the August 2003 issue of Scientific American magazine. Books and other writing John Hale has authored a number of books.

Plot As the sun burns out and darkness shrouds the planet, the wealthy Beaty familywaiting for a pre-arranged rescue from their country estatemust reckon with long-held grudges and heal painful memories from the past. Strict father Raymond, always mentally abusive to his wife and kids, becomes more so as he does not get a return call from the Senator who had promised to evacuate the Beaty family to a secure facility in caves. Wife Georgina needs a steady supply of pills to deal with the mental break caused by the suicide of teenaged daughter Abbey five years earlier. Eldest child Raymond Jr. (Ray) left after his sister died, telling everyone that her suicide was due to their father. Second child Fred arrives with an unexpected (the family does not communicate much) girlfriend, Margot, who is nine months pregnant. Youngest child Clara, the only one still living at home, turns 15 a few days after the others arrive. Naively, she is the most hopeful of them all. Raymond treats the family harshly, accusing Margot of being a gold digger wanting to be saved, constantly telling Georgina that she is responsible for Abbey‚Äôs death, and chasing off Brian, Ray‚Äôs boyfriend, when he shows up to spend his expected final days with the man he loves. The world is plunged into constant night. Margot gives birth the same ‚Äúday‚Äù that the senator finally calls, confirming that the cave plan was unsuccessful. Raymond tells the family that their evacuation is imminent, but Ray has overheard the phone call. While the others pack and Georgina prepares a meal, Ray gathers the same type of berry that Abbey ate to painlessly poison herself.

The drink has had different recipes over the years, but a prominent version from the 1970s calls for 1 1/2 oz of dark Jamaican rum, 1 oz light Puerto Rican rum, 3/4 oz coffee flavored brandy, 1 1/2 oz unsweetened pineapple juice, 1 oz lemon juice, and 1/2 oz of sugar syrup. The mug has the same name as the drink, Mr. Bali Hai, and comes in the shape of a headhunter's head with a removable lid. Despite the use of a headhunter themed mug and shared coffee flavored ingredients, the Mr. Bali Hai otherwise bears little resemblance to Trader Vic's flaming Coffee Grog, which was served in a \\"headhunter cup\\". History The Mr. Bali Hai was the signature drink of the Bali Hai shortly after it opened in 1954, and became synonymous with the Mr. Bali Hai motif that served not just as a mug but also as the restaurant's signage and large entrance way wood carving. Credible information is not available as to who invented the first Mr. Bali Hai recipe. According to the Bali Hai, \\"The original mug was manufactured by Otagiri Mug Company and was served with a fabulous concoction of fine spirits brewed by the Bali Hai‚Äôs own resident witch doctor! Two holes in the lid made his head a party for two!\\" Tom Ham was the original and long time owner of the Bali Hai. Mr. Bali Hai's name is likely a reference to the 1949 musical South Pacific and its famous song, Bali Ha'i, which referred to a mystical tropical island. Shelter Island's Bali Hai website says that Tom Ham renamed the bankrupt [Christian's Hut] restaurant the Bali Hai, which means, ‚ÄúYour own special island‚Äù. The restaurant has been noted by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The entrance way statue carving of Mr. Bali Hai was restored in 2001. Variations Although the Mr. Bali Hai cocktail is synonymous with the Bali Hai restaurant, the drink is still served at other tiki establishments where it retains its noted coffee flavored profile. Because coffee flavored brandy can be harder to find, when made at home the drink is often crafted instead with more common rum-based coffee liquors, such as Tia Maria or Kahl√∫a. A newer version being served at the Bali Hai uses blackberry brandy instead of coffee brandy. The new flavors as first described on a 2007 menu include: pineapple juice, sweet & sour, blackberry, Ron Rico light rum, and Lemon Hart 151 proof rum.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999|page=17 Close to New Castle, yet considered a remote area, the site features a pristine, low-elevation stream and three mountains separated by steep drainages. The area is part of the Craig Creek Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, about 4 miles east of New Castle, Virginia. It is between Va 614 on the west and Va 666 on the east. Trails into the area include: *Ferrier Trail, Forest Trail 189, 2.34 miles *Lick Branch Trail, Forest Trail 262, 5.21 miles *North Mountain Trail, Forest Trail 263, 13.2 miles *Lees Creek Trail, Forest Trail 5011, 2.71 miles Three roads give access to the area: Hebron Road, Route 5064; Price Mountain, Route 5012; and Larsen Road, Route 5061. Boundary of the Broad Run wildland as identified by the Wilderness SocietyThe boundary of the wildland, as determined by the Wilderness Society, is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 788 (Covington, Alleghany Highlands). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Broad Run wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps New Castle, Catawba, Oriskany and Daleville. Natural history The area is within the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Section in the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. Yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock and red maple are found in colluvial drainages, toeslopes and along flood plains of small to medium-sized streams. White oak, northern red oak, and hickory dominate on the north and west, while chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine are found on ridgetops and exposed sites. The area includes the Lick Branch Barren special biological area and a Central Appalachian Shale Barren terrestrial community. The shale barren provides habitat for the Virginia white-haired leatherflower. The narrow- leaved blue-curls has been seen within the area. Topography The area is distinguished by ridges that trend northeast/southwest. The ridges, composed of sandstone or shale, have parallel drainages flowing into broad limestone valleys. The area has three separate ridges, Lick Mountain, Broad Run Mountain, and Caldwell Mountain, with small steep sideslope drainages. From a 2964-foot peak along the crest of Broad Run Mountain, the elevation dips to 1240 feet at Rolands Run Branch on the northwest. Silurian-aged sandstone underlays about 75 percent of the area, with the remaining area underlain by Braillier and Martinsburg shale. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Broad Run was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The Cuba timber sale of 40 acres occurred in 2000 on land north of Rolands Run, just north of the wildarea. In the southwest, the Cuba wildfire in 2008 burned part of this area as well as part of the adjacent Spesard Knob wildarea. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. The uplands of Lick Mountain, Broad Run Mountain, and Caldwell Mountain were designated ‚ÄúBackcountry-Non Motorized‚Äù, while lower elevations on the northeast are designated ‚ÄúDispersed Recreation Area-Suitable for Timber Production‚Äù. There is a small area designated as ‚ÄúRare Community‚Äù. Cultural history A 1998 survey of a small part of the area found three transient camps and a hunting station believed to have been used prior to 1,000 B. C. A 19th century mining complex and colliers pit were also discovered.

It is often due to the build-up of fatty deposits in the lumen of blood vessels or infection of the vessel wall. This can occur in various locations such as coronary blood vessels, peripheral arteries and veins. The narrowed arteries would block the blood supply to different organs and tissues. In severe conditions, it may develop into more critical health problems like myocardial infarction, stroke or heart failure, which are some of the major reasons of death. There are many causes contributing to blood vessel disorder including high blood cholesterol and calcium levels, blood clot formation and inflammation of arteries. It is found that age, sedentary lifestyle, diets rich in lipids, smoking, diabetes and family history of cardiovascular diseases are common risk factors. A mild degree of blood vessel disorder may be asymptomatic. Blood tests on cholesterol and calcium level can be performed to monitor the risk of having the disorder. Additionally, techniques such as angiography and ultrasound imaging are useful tools for diagnosis. It can be treated by both medication or surgery, depending on the type of blood vessel disorder.  Types of Blood Vessel Disorder  Atherosclerosis: narrowing of the artery  Atherosclerosis  Atherosclerosis is a developmental disease in the large arteries, defined by the accumulation of lipids, macrophages and fibrous materials in the intima. When the endothelial cell of blood vessel is damaged, it loses the ability to regulate itself. It results in inflammation as the macrophages irrupt the vessel wall. Macrophages take up lipoprotein to form foam cells and release growth factor cytokines to attract more macrophages and smooth muscle cells. A plaque is formed and proliferate to a larger size, gradually occluding the blood flow. More importantly, it causes different complications that affect the whole body.  Aneurysm  An aneurysm is a localized enlargement of arteries, characterized by a balloon-like bulge. It results from the abnormal weakening of blood vessel wall. Common types of aneurysm include abdominal aortic aneurysm, thoracic aortic aneurysm and intracranial aneurysm. Most types of aneurysm, except intracranial aneurysm, are mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Symptoms of Raynaud's disease  Raynaud‚Äôs Disease  Raynaud‚Äôs disease is a rare peripheral vascular syndrome that narrows blood vessels, generally in the hands and feet, due to cold or stressful emotion. It is recognized by the reduction of blood flow to fingers and toes with periodic spasm and results in a drastic color change to white or blue. The disease may further develop into ischaemic pain and necrosis of fingers or toes. The pathology of Raynaud's disease starts with the activation of sympathetic nervous system triggered by cold or the feeling of stress. Symptoms of erythromelalgia  Venous thromboembolism  Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common peripheral venous disease. It is defined by the occlusion of venous blood vessels by blood clots. There are two major types of VTE: deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. DVT is often found in the calf, accompanies with the swelling of limbs along the deep vein while pulmonary embolism causes chronic pulmonary hypertension. VTE is the third deadliest cardiovascular disease in the world. Haemostasis is the rapid development of blood clots for the purpose of reducing blood loss. On the contrary, venous clots are formed much slower, in terms of several days or even weeks. Abnormality of coagulation during haemostasis, change in blood flow and endothelial failure may trigger VTE.  Erythromelalgia  Erythromelalgia is a rare clinical disorder causing redness, burning sensation and intense pain in limbs. It is more common to be found in lower limbs than upper limbs. Erythromelalgia initiated from dysfunction of peripheral nerves that thickens the blood vessel walls, resulting in hyperaemic flow in limbs.  Stroke  Stroke is a serious condition of blood vessel disorder caused by the stop of blood supply to the brain. Brain cells with ceased oxygen supply from blood will die in millions per second. Not only is it one of the major causes of death around the world, it is also the cause of permanent disability. Two major types of stroke include ischemic stroke which is caused by atherosclerosis in the brain and hemorrhagic stroke which is the bleeding in the brain due to weakened blood vessel wall inside the brain.  Signs and symptoms  It is often asymptomatic in the early stages of blood vessel disorder. When the disease develops, a variety of signs can be observed in different body parts. For instance, patients may have pale skin, cold hands and feet, and numb fingertips. These are mainly due to the reduction in blood flow to the limbs, resulting in a decrease in heat distribution to these areas. Ulcers and wounds would also take a much longer time to heal because of the impairment in blood clot formation process. Muscle weakness and cramping may occur as well, especially in the legs, because of the insufficient oxygen supply to muscle cells for metabolism.  Complications  The vascular system strongly influences the condition of the heart. It is also vital in the rest of the body as the blood vessels are in charge of carrying nutrients and the discard of metabolic wastes. Therefore, blood vessel disorder can cause serious complications in the whole body. Coronary arteries are the blood vessels that supply to the heart for its normal function. Blood vessel disorders occur in coronary arteries would affect cardiac activity. For instance, due to atherosclerosis, the plaque would obstruct and causes ischaemia - the reduction of blood flow through the arteries. Ischaemia would then result in the decrease in oxygen supply to the heart, hence weaken the heart. It causes a vicious cycle as a weakened heart contraction would decrease blood supply to the body, including cardiac muscle (muscle of heart). Moreover, if the plaque suddenly ruptures in the heart, it will cause a heart attack.  Risk factors  Various factors may affect one's susceptibility to blood vessel disorders, including behavioural (e.g. smoking), demographic (e.g. age) and genetic (family history) factors. Most of these risk factors first promote the increase in blood pressure, followed by other symptoms and signs.  Age  The rise of blood pressure is correlated to ageing. The arterial compliance - the amount of tension produced per stretch of arteries, decreases with age, and the stiffness of arteries increases with age. The structural change in blood vessels causes the elderly to be more susceptible to hypertension, which leads to complications in arteries, the heart and even the brain.  Obesity  Having obesity would increase the risk of atherosclerosis. A high-fat and high-cholesterol diet would result in an elevation of lipoprotein level, which is one of the constituents of plaque. Lipoprotein level above > 25‚Äì30 mg/dl is considered more susceptible by blood vessel disorders.  Family history  Some of the blood vessel disorders are inherited. For instance, erythromelalgia is caused by the mutation of the SCN9A gene, which alters the neural pathway to blood vessels. Genetic disorders that affect the circulatory, immune or neural system may contribute to hereditary blood vessel disorder. If one‚Äôs family history shows records of vascular disorders, it is more likely to inherit the same disease.  Smoking  Both active or passive smoking may bring harm to the vascular system. For instance, cigarette smoking, cannabinoids and smokeless tobacco use were all found to raise blood pressure and increase the risk of stroke. Moreover, cigar and cigarette smoking may also cause arterial stiffness.  Medication  Some medications may have the side effect of increasing blood pressure and may even suppress the effect of anti-inflammatory drugs. Pain and anti- inflammatory drugs like Indomethacin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and piroxicam would retain water in the systemic circulation, raising the blood pressure. Other types of medications like antidepressant, hormone and caffeine would also increase blood pressure.  Diagnosis  Doctors may look for signs of narrowed, enlarged or hardened arteries by performing a physical examination. If blood vessel disorder is present, there will be a weak or even absent pulse under the narrowed area of the artery. The blood pressure in the affected limb would be lowered and whooshing sounds can be heard over the affected arteries using a stethoscope. After that, the following tests could be adapted to further locate the point of narrowing or enlargement of blood vessels. Angiography showing blockade of coronary artery  Angiography  Angiography is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the lumen of blood vessels. A catheter, which is a long and thin tube, is inserted into a large artery in the arm or groin area. It is then guided along the artery to the targeted blood vessel to be examined. An imaging dye is loaded into the blood vessel through the catheter and the movement of the dye in the blood vessel is recorded as an angiogram. Doctors could determine if there are any abnormalities in the blood vessel using fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT) angiography or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. After the catheter is removed, some pressure is applied to the incision site for 10 to 20 minutes to prevent excessive bleeding.  Vascular ultrasound  Vascular ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging method to examine the circulation inside blood vessels. Sound waves are transmitted through the tissues of the targeted area and they reflect on the blood cells moving within blood vessels. The waves recorded are displayed as an image of the blood vessel and the speed of waves detected can be used to calculate the speed of blood flow inside the vessel. When the rate of blood flow is too low, there may be a blockage of vessel. By evaluating blood flow in vessels, the severity and specific location of blood vessel disorder can be determined.  Treatments  Different kinds of treatment should be adopted according to the type and severity of blood vessel disorder. Medications are usually prescribed to relieve specific symptoms arisen from the disease while surgery like angioplasty can be performed to provide a more long-lasting effect.  Surgery  Angioplasty is a procedure used to widen narrowed blood vessels, especially in coronary arteries. A long and thin tube called catheter is inserted into a large artery through an incision in the wrist, arm or groin area. The catheter is guided to the affected artery using a real-time x-ray video. A thin wire is then introduced into the blood vessel, delivering a small balloon to the affected area. The balloon is inflated to stretch the blood vessel and compress the fatty deposits against the wall of artery. Hence, the vessel is widened and blood can flow through it freely to maintain adequate blood supply to different tissues. Finally, the balloon is deflated and removed. A stent may also be placed to provide support to the vessel wall and prevent it from re-narrowing.  Medications  Beta blockers are medications that inhibit the sympathetic nervous system by blocking the beta adrenergic receptors. They can be used to slow down heart rate and decrease blood pressure by inhibiting beta receptors in the heart. These medications also induce vasodilation by relaxing smooth muscle in blood vessels. Examples of beta blockers include carvedilol, metoprolol, and bisoprolol. Calcium channel blockers are medications that prevent the movement of calcium ions across calcium channels. They can be used to relieve hypertension by causing vascular smooth muscle relaxation. They also reduce the heart rate and contractility to lower the cardiac output, which in turn lower blood pressure. Amlodipine, hydralazine and dihydropyridine are examples of calcium channel blockers. Other medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics can be used to relieve hypertension. Statins and fibrates can also be prescribed to lower blood cholesterol level and hence reducing the risk of plaque formation in blood vessels. Anti- platelet medications e.g. aspirin help reducing blood clot formation in vessels as well.

A member of this family is called a felid. The term \\"cat\\" refers both to felids in general and specifically to domestic cats. The characteristic features of cats have evolved to support a carnivorous lifestyle, with adaptations for ambush or stalking and short pursuit hunting. They have slender muscular bodies, strong flexible forelimbs and retractable claws for holding prey, dental and cranial adaptations for a strong bite, and often have characteristic striped or spotted coat patterns for camouflage. Felidae comprises two extant subfamilies, the Pantherinae and the Felinae. The former includes the five Panthera species tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard, as well as the two Neofelis species clouded leopard and Sunda clouded leopard. The subfamily Felinae includes 12 genera and 34 species, such as the bobcat, caracal, cheetah, cougar, ocelot, and common domestic cat. Traditionally, five subfamilies have been distinguished within the Felidae based on phenotypical features: the Felinae, the Pantherinae, the Acinonychinae (cheetahs), the extinct Machairodontinae, and the extinct Proailurinae. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that living (extant) felids fall into eight lineages (clades). The placement of the cheetah within the Puma lineage invalidates the traditional subfamily Acinonychinae, and recent sources use only two subfamilies for extant genera. The number of accepted species in Felidae has been around 40 since the 18th century, though research, especially modern molecular phylogenetic analysis, has over time adjusted the generally accepted genera as well as the divisions between recognized subspecies, species, and population groups. In addition to the extant species listed here, over 30 fossil genera have been described; these are divided into the subfamilies Felinae, Pantherinae, Proailurinae, and Machairodontinae. This final subfamily includes the genus Smilodon, known as the saber-toothed tiger, which went extinct around 10,000 years ago. The earliest known felid genus is Proailurus, part of Proailurinae, which lived approximately 25 million years ago in Eurasia. Conventions Conservation status codes listed follow the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Range maps are provided wherever possible; if a range map is not available, a description of the cat's range is provided. Ranges are based on the IUCN red list for that species unless otherwise noted. All extinct species or subspecies listed went extinct after 1500 CE, and are indicated by a dagger symbol \\"\\".

The family Felidae consists of 41 extant species belonging to 14 genera and divided into 92 subspecies.

Three or more meals were to be eaten each day, one with cabbage or lettuce. The diet was followed for ten days and was said to produce a weight loss of four to nine pounds. Harrop recommended adding eggs, fish and lean meat to the diet after ten days.James, T. F. (April 7, 1963). Fads and Frenzies.

It will run through the central part of the Tooele Valley, located in eastern Tooele County. Route description The Midvalley Highway is proposed to begin at SR-36 south of the city of Tooele, proceeding to the northwest. After crossing the Union Pacific Railroad's main line, it will turn to the northeast, passing the east side of the Utah Industrial Depot. After passing the depot, it will turn to the northwest again before crossing SR-112 at 1000 North. The route will cross Sheep Lane and Erda Way before reaching SR-138, where it will turn back to the northeast. It will proceed northeast to a trumpet interchange at Interstate 80, where it will end. At full build-out, the highway will be approximately long, consisting of of arterial and of freeway. History Planning The need for a highway running down the center of the Tooele Valley had been identified by 2001, when it was recognized that the existing SR-36 would not have enough capacity for future traffic volumes. Although initial remedies included widening SR-36 and a new 1000 North extension (now part of SR-112), planners knew the Midvalley Highway would eventually be needed as a long-term solution. By January 2011, UDOT released an Environmental Impact Statement defining a Preferred Alternative for the route. A Travel Demand and Crash Data Review was completed in November 2013. On May 11, 2018, the Utah Transportation Commission signed a resolution designating State Route 179 as the official number for the Midvalley Highway, defining SR-179 as the proposed highway from SR-138 north to I-80. The same resolution also mandated that SR-138 end at the Midvalley Highway; the segment between there and SR-36 will revert to Tooele County jurisdiction. However, these changes are contingent on the construction of the relevant segment of the new Midvalley Highway, and as such were not included in the 2019 Legislature's annual state highway amendments bill. Construction The Utah Department of Transportation is currently working with Tooele County to design Phase 1 of the project. This phase will consist of a two-lane freeway from Interstate 80 to the current SR-138, a distance of . In addition, the existing SR-138 roadway will be realigned, and a new intersection will be constructed at Sheep Lane. Pre-construction work will begin in summer 2019, but major construction is not expected until 2021. Future Plans call for the segment between I-80 and SR-112 to be eventually upgraded to a four-lane freeway, with the portion between SR-36 and SR-112 becoming a four-lane arterial. Interchanges are proposed at I-80, SR-138, 1000 North (SR-112), and the future 3400 North parkway, with at-grade intersections planned for Utah Avenue (former SR-112) and SR-36. Grade separations will be provided at the Union Pacific Railroad line, Erda Way, Sheep Lane, and the future Midvalley Trail. Major intersections This table reflects the full proposed routing.

Physical activity is defined as any voluntary body movement requiring energy expenditure produced by skeletal muscles. Insufficient physical activity is defined as physical inactivity. Sufficient physical activity is defined as adults having at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week, or any combination of the two. Insufficient physical activity would hence be defined as the inability to meet the aforementioned WHO recommendations. Insufficient physical activity has been linked to prevention of several chronic diseases and premature deaths as compared to sufficient physical activity. Globally, physical inactivity was seen in 23% of men and 32% of women over 18. Physical inactivity levels have remained relatively constant throughout the years, with only a 1% decrease from 2001 to 2016. As of 2016, Kuwait had the highest prevalence of physical inactivity of 67%, while Uganda had the lowest prevalence of physical inactivity of 5.5%, i.e. Uganda was the most physically active country, and Kuwait is the least physically active country in the world. Since physical activity levels can be measured through many means, including questionnaires, accelerometers, pedometers, calorimetry and direct observation, statistics on the epidemiology of physical activity vary between sources. Survey questionnaires are the most frequently used method of measuring physical activity worldwide, making it easier to compare across countries to obtain physical activity epidemiology.  Africa and the Mediterranean  African countries generally have higher levels of physical activity compared to other continents. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have a higher prevalence of sufficient physical activity than the Mediterranean. The prevalence of physical activity in Sub-Saharan African countries is 78.6% overall, with 82.1% and 75.2% prevalence of sufficient physical activity in adult men and women respectively. The prevalence of sufficient physical activity in Mediterranean countries is 61.2%, with 74.1% and 60.1% prevalence of sufficient physical activity in adult males and females respectively.  Algeria  The prevalence of physical activity in Algerian adults is 66%. The prevalence of sufficient physical activity in adult Algerian males and females is 72% and 59% respectively. In 2011, it was found that 20.7% of Algerian adolescents aged 13‚Äì15 were sufficiently physically active, following the standard of having at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day for 5 or more days a week. Algerian boys and Algerian girls had 31.5% and 11.0% prevalence of sufficient physical activity.  Ghana  84% of Ghana adults were sufficiently physically active, and men and women had 87% and 82% prevalence of sufficient physical activity respectively.  Kenya  81% of Kenyan adults were sufficiently physically active, and men and women had 83% and 79% prevalence of sufficient physical activity respectively.  Nigeria  The prevalence of sufficient physical activity in Nigeria is 78%, with 79% and 76% prevalence of sufficient physical activity in adult males and females respectively.  South Africa  The prevalence of sufficient physical activity in South Africa is 53%, with 58% and 43% prevalence of sufficient physical activity in adult males and females respectively.  Uganda  Uganda is the most physically active country of the world, with 94.5% physical activity as of 2016.  Asia  In general, Asian countries have decreasing prevalence of activity due to mechanization of work and transport and the spread of sedentary lifestyle. The prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity are both generally high in Asia at around 60%, with Saudi Arabia with the lowest physical activity in the world at 39%.  China  Physical activity prevalence in China is at 76%, with 78% in men and 78% in women. Statistically recorder physical activity of men is usually higher than that of women, but the data shows similar activity level between two sexes in China. This is possibly due to the family culture, which the wife is responsible for domestic work, accounting for a certain level of physical activity of female in China.  Japan  The prevalence of physical activity in Japan is 66%, with 69% in males and 64% in females.  South Korea  The prevalence of sufficient physical activity in Korea is 67%, with 71% in males and 62% in females.  Nepal  In 2003, physical activity prevalence in adults was 25.5% in males and 8.8% in females. The level of physical activity increased rapidly from 2003 to 2016; as of 2016, Nepal had the highest physical activity among all Asian countries at 86.6%.  Saudi Arabia  The prevalence of physical activity in Saudi Arabia is 54.1% for male and 34.9% for females.  Europe  The prevalence of physical activity in Europe is 76.6%, with 78% prevalence in males and 73.3% prevalence in females.

Moldova  The prevalence of physical activity in Moldova is the highest, at 87.5%, with 88% prevalence in men and 87% prevalence in women. The World Health Organisation has been cooperating with schools in Moldova by teaching school children about the importance of adequate physical activity.  The Netherlands  In the Netherlands, 61% of the population is physically active, with 63% of men and 60% of women being sufficiently physically active.  Serbia  In Serbia, the overall prevalence of physical activity is 60.5%, with 67% and 56% of sufficiently active men and women respectively.  Latin America and the Caribbean  The prevalence of sufficient physical activity in Latin America and the Caribbean is 60.9%,with 65.7% activity in males and 56.3% activity in females.

New Zealand  The general physical activity in New Zealand is relatively low, with 57.6% of adults being physically active. 60.7% of men and 54.7% of women have been measured as sufficiently physically active.  Fiji  Physical activity in Fiji is relatively high, with 83.4% of its adult population is physically active. 82.8% of men and 84% of women are physically active and the difference between 2 sexes is very small as compared to other countries.  USA  60% of adult citizens in the USA are physically active, with 68.3% of men and 52% of women being sufficiently active.  Factors Affecting Level of Physical Activity   Personal  Personal factors, including, age, genotype, gender, race and ethnicity, are fixed in every person, and influence one‚Äôs physical activity capacity.  Environmental  The built environment, which includes availability of green spaces, walkability and recreation centres plays a role in the physical activity levels of individuals. In urban areas, walkability is affected by ease of access of walking paths, availability of shade and safety.  Socioeconomic  Technological innovations reduce physical demands of work, home and travel. On the other hand, leisure time is increased and more higher- intensity physical activity can be carried out. Suburbanisation of both population and employment in lower density communities increase reliance on private vehicles hence lower physical activity for transportation.

It is used as a medical intervention to salvage limbs that are at risk of amputation and to improve walking ability in people with severe intermittent claudication (leg muscle pain) and ischemic rest pain. Popliteal bypass surgery is a common type of peripheral bypass surgery which carries blood from the femoral artery of the thigh to the end of the popliteal artery behind the knee. The femoral artery runs along the thigh and extends to become the popliteal artery which runs posteriorly to the knee joint and femur. Smaller arteries carry blood supply from the popliteal artery to the calf and into the foot. Blockages caused by plaque build-up or atherosclerosis in any of these arteries can reduce leg blood circulation, causing leg pain that may interfere with daily life. Standard Popliteal bypass surgery involves the bypass of the popliteal artery. During surgery, incisions are made depending on the location of the blockage. Usually, a healthy vein is located and sewn above and below the blockage to bypass the narrowed or blocked femoral artery. This allows the blood to be redirected to flow through the new healthy vessel around the blockage. In some cases, synthetic graft materials (such as polytetrafluoroethylene) are used instead of a vein graft.  Uses  Femoropopliteal bypass surgery is mainly used to treat cases of femoral artery blockage that cause more severe symptoms that restrict completion of daily tasks such as peripheral artery disease and claudication, or cases that have not responded well to other treatment options . Before surgery is considered, adjustments are made to lifestyle habits such as quitting smoking or exercising more, or using medications, to relieve or improve symptoms. Claudication refers to pain in the lower limbs that may be felt while exercising, walking, or simply while resting. A blocked femoral artery reduces the blood flow to the areas of the thigh and calf, causing the pain that leads to claudication. Severe pain caused by claudication can lead to a person having very restricted ability to move, and pain while resting is often a sign that the condition has worsened. Claudication is also considered a symptom of peripheral artery disease. Popliteal bypass surgery may be performed on people with the following symptoms and conditions: * Disruption in daily life or the ability to walk from intermittent claudication * Persistent wounds in the leg * Infection or gangrene * Ischemic rest pain (due to lack of blood circulation resulting in leg pain at rest)  Efficiency  Generally, a vein bypass lasts at least 5 years in 60-70 percent of people. However about one-quarter to one-third of people will need additional procedures and follow-ups to maintain the condition of the graft. To minimise postoperative complications and a second bypass, correct postoperative care and surgical techniques must be used. In comparison, synthetic grafts are more likely to become occluded in the future than using the person's blood vessel. A synthetic graft remains open in 33 to 50 out of 100 people 5 years after Popliteal bypass surgery was carried out, whereas using veins, the bypass remains unobstructed in 66 out of 100 people. Moreover, the particular vein, great saphenous vein was shown to be more durable over the years after surgery. Also, when comparing the efficacy of using PTFE or the great saphenous vein in people with claudication and critical limb ischemia, the latter showed better long term results. A second bypass may be required if a blockage forms in the bypass graft later on. Over time, there is a decreasing trend of percentage patency (likelihood a vessel will remain open) in popliteal bypass surgery, 88% in the first year, 79% and 76% at 3 and 5 years respectively. Environmental conditions and overall patient health may also affect the patency of the graft.  Complications  Since the operation involves multiple cuts being made on the leg, this relatively high risk surgery involves several risks. Some complications are common for all types of leg associated surgery, while some are specific to popliteal bypass surgery. Complications include but not limited to the following: In the study of 6,007 people carried out popliteal bypass surgery, the overall rate of morbidity and mortality was 36.8% and 2.3% respectively within 30 days post-surgery. However, there are variations in studies of mortality as one particular study did not find any person deaths. The pre-existing risk factors in people can affect mortality rates, with common mortality factors being heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, infection, and stroke.  Infection  Although antibiotics are generally given before and after surgery, people are still susceptible to wound infections and there is a 7.8% incidence of popliteal bypass surgery associated infections. Infection contraction is common in popliteal bypass surgery because of the poor blood circulation to the area, poor circulation means that the wounds will heal slower and the incision sites will have a higher chance of becoming infected. The infection of the vascular graft prosthesis occurs in every 1 in 500 people, under such circumstance the removal of the graft is needed. Graft infection is strongly associated with high morbidity and mortality. An obvious sign of a graft infection is the drainage of the sinus tract. Diabetes mellitus and redoing of the bypass graft are associated with a higher chance for graft infection. However, the reduction of graft infection frequency and complication can be brought by the advances in surgical techniques and graft design.  Bleeding  Occasionally, there may be leakage of fluid or blood from the incision wound, a study shows that 7.4 percent people are affected within 30 days post operation. However this normally settles in time and does not indicate a problem with the bypass itself.  Heart problems  People with peripheral artery disease undergoing popliteal bypass surgery are also more susceptible to myocardial infarction and abnormal heart rhythms, as patients requiring popliteal bypass are more likely to have higher cholesterol levels and higher blood pressure. The excess strain and damage caused by HBP and high cholesterol level can cause atherosclerosis. Over time, the coronary artery narrows and increases the patient's chance of getting a heart attack. Myocardial infarctions can also be caused by graft failure and hypoperfusion.  Lymphedema  The risk of lymphedema exists in 29 percent of patients, where leg swelling typically lasts 2 to 3 months. Lymphedema can be caused by blockages in the lymphatic system, leading to insufficient lymph drainage and fluid build-up in the leg. Though it is incurable, swelling of the leg is usually temporary. Treatment like compression stockings, meticulous skin care or doing remedial exercises may help ameliorate the symptoms.  Amputation  In rare situations when blockages severely disrupt or stop blood circulation, critical limb ischemia occurs. In cases of ischaemia, insufficient blood available for tissues to survive leads to gangrene and rest pain, in which case amputation is required. The major goals of amputation are to remove dead tissues, relieve pain and promote wound healing.  Blood clots  With surgery operations such as popliteal bypass, there will be an increased probability of blood clot formation. In rare cases, a part of the clot in the leg breaks free and travels to the lungs, this is also known as a pulmonary embolism. A blockage in the blood vessels of the lung can be formed by pulmonary embolism, and this could cause excess fluid build-up in the lung. This condition is also known as pulmonary edema, which is the excess fluid present in the lungs, more specifically, the accumulation of excess fluid in the air sacs of the lung, leading to the impairment of gas exchange and potentially respiratory failure. The incidence of early graft thrombosis is between 5-15% for popliteal bypass surgery. The cause of thrombosis is commonly due to technical errors of the surgery, other causes may include stenosis, narrow vein grafts, a low cardiac output and the compression of the graft. In such cases, heparin (anticoagulant) and thrombectomy can be used to treat graft thrombosis.  Procedure  The surgery is generally performed under general anaesthesia. The surgeon makes an incision in the upper leg, and a graft either man-made or the patient's vein is sewn to both ends of the artery. The graft reroutes the blood flow around the blocked artery, allowing for adequate supply back to the parts of the leg. Generally, it is preferred where possible, a healthy vein is used to make the graft as it has shown to have a better outcome of the procedure. In cases however where a vein can not be used, materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or Dacron are often used to make the graft. # The person is brought to the operating room lying face up. # An intravenous (IV) line is placed in either the collarbone, hand or arm. Catheters may be put in the wrist and neck area to monitor the heart and blood pressure of the patient, as well as for obtaining blood samples. # The patient's blood pressure, blood oxygen level, heart rate and breathing is monitored during surgery by an anaesthesiologist. # Both local anaesthesia or general anaesthesia may be used in popliteal bypass surgery. For local anaesthesia, a nasal cannula is needed to provide patients with sufficient oxygen. For general anaesthesia, after the patient sedated, a breathing tube is used instead to transport oxygen and connects to a ventilator to aid patient breathing. # A catheter is used to drain patient urine from the bladder. # To prevent bacterial infection, antibiotics are given to the patient via IV. # After cleaning the skin over the surgical site, the surgeon will make an incision in the leg, which is dependent on the portion of the arteries to be bypassed. The use of either a man-made graft or a vein from the leg is determined by the surgeon. # Both ends of the chosen graft are sewn using fine stitches above and below the blockage site of the target artery. # After sewing, an arteriogram is run to make sure normal blood flow is returned to the leg through the new bypass graft and the incision is closed using staples or stitches. # Depending on the patient's blood pressure, blood pressure medicine may be given via IV during and after the procedure to keep it within normal range. # A sterile bandage or dressing will be applied over the treated area.  Types of grafts  Blood vessel grafts often come from the same leg of the bypass site, which are arteries above and below the knee. These grafts can only be removed and prepared during surgery at the time of the bypass. However, in some cases a leg vein is left in place and connected to the artery (in situ procedure). Under this circumstance, an angioscope (a flexible medical tube with a camera) is used to aid this procedure. As mentioned, synthetic graft material like PTFE may be an option if the surgeon does not find suitable veins. PTFE is commonly used in bypasses involving arteries at or above the knee.  Post surgery care  In order to reduce the risk of complications after surgery, patients should refrain from smoking because it can decrease blood circulation, which makes the graft more likely to fail. Walking is also essential during early recovery periods, it may help reduce swelling to facilitate wound healing and aids collateral artery formation in the leg, which can improve blood flow around blockages. Often, physiotherapy treatments are given to patients after operation to help the patients ease into walking and other movements to keep the leg muscle flexible. Other factors such as maintaining a healthy diet and regular exercise may also prevent unnecessary strain on the leg arteries from weight gain. The above interventions after surgery can improve blood circulation overall and reduce the risks of getting a second bypass.  Alternatives  In some cases where the blockage is not as severe or limb threatening, alternative procedures that may take place are percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or endarterectomy. These procedures are used when possible as they are considered to be minimally invasive, in turn reducing recovery time and possible complications post-surgery.  History  Historically, the first incidence of using a vein to bypass a femoral artery was in 1948 to treat a patient suffering from a foot ulcer. Although the bypass technique was not a new discovery, it was not yet widely used and known. In 1962, a new surgical technique, otherwise known as the in situ procedure was developed and used on veins to improve bypass. It works by increasing the radius of the vein to increase blood flow along the blood vessel. Today, it has now been proved that the in situ procedure is better suited in vein bypasses in the lower leg compared to the upper leg, particularly for treating advanced ischemic disease in the lower leg.

The numerical designation \\"60\\" appears to have been attached to the formation that quickly became the 4th Airborne Corps after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. The corps was then active 1943‚Äì45, ending the war with the 2nd Guards Army. Soon after the end of the war, by December 1945 it was transferred to the Stavropol Military District with headquarters at Pyatigorsk with its wartime divisions. At some later point (sources disagree), the 23rd Bratislava Red Banner Rifle Corps was disbanded by renumbering it as the 60th Rifle Corps. Within the former 23rd-now-60th Rifle Corps was the 252nd Rifle Division, which became the 15th Separate Rifle Brigade on July 1, 1946. The division's 924th, 928th, and 932nd Rifle Regiments became the 168th, 172nd, and 176th Separate Rifle Battalions, respectively, while the divisional artillery brigade was eliminated. The 787th Artillery Regiment, 23rd Separate Self-Propelled Artillery Battery with the SU-76s, the 332nd Separate Motor Reconnaissance Company, and communications, sapper, and training rifle companies rounded out the brigade.

Joe is a serial killer, stalker and former bookstore manager who, upon meeting Guinevere Beck at his workplace in New York, starts to develop an extreme, toxic and delusional obsession. After moving to Los Angeles, to escape his sordid past, he meets avid chef Love Quinn, and starts to fall into his old habits of obsession and violence in order to avoid the fate of his past romantic endeavors. Television series Early life At the story's outset, it is revealed that Joe (born April 8) was orphaned at a young age. From flashbacks, it is revealed that Joe's biological mother, Sandy (Magda Apanowicz) was abused by his biological father and that he was subjected to neglect and abuse by his father. Seeking to protect his mother, Joe (Aidan Wallace) shoots and kills his biological father. Sometime after, she tells him she is currently not fit to care for him and a Child Protection Services worker takes him and sends him to New York State‚Äôs Irving Group Home For Boys. After a few years in the foster care system, it's implied that Mr. Mooney (Mark Blum) adopted Joe (Gianni Ciardiello), took care of him and gave him a job at the bookstore. Though, it is later highlighted that Mooney subjected Joe to a similar abusive treatment, locking him in a plexiglass cage vault, below his bookstore, against his will. As part of his \\"lesson\\", Mooney would teach the value of reading and books to Joe, in order to show his affection and reverence towards such activities. Season 1 Joe, now the bookstore's manager, tries to win over MFA student Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail) by manipulating everything and everyone around her. He justifies his actions by stating that in order to pursue Beck, he wants to make sure that she is worth it and won't break his heart. He continuously implies that a similar instance occurred in the past with his ex- girlfriend, Candace Stone (Ambyr Childers), who is presumed to be dead. Joe is also good friends with his kid next-door neighbor, Paco (Luca Padovan), who has an abusive home life and is always trying to escape by reading books. After Paco attempts to kill Ron (Daniel Cosgrove) by giving him an overdose of pills, Ron passes out outside Joe's apartment and savagely beats Joe upon waking. Paco's mom, Claudia (Victoria Cartagena) breaks up with Ron, with Joe's encouragement, but soon relapses back into drug addiction. After a day of following Beck around in the shadows, Joe saves Beck after she falls on to a train track. At the same time, he steals her phone and after she replaces it, he is able to read her messages synced to the cloud. He believes her friend Benji Ashby (Lou Taylor Pucci) is an obstacle to his future relationship with Beck and tricks Benji into meeting him, hits him over the head, and keeps him captive in a climate-controlled cage for rare books in Mooney's basement. He eventually kills Benji using his peanut allergy to induce anaphylactic shock and burns his remains in the woods. Joe and Beck start dating and he is introduced to her wealthy Ivy League friends. Her best friend, Peach Salinger (Shay Mitchell), is suspicious of his intentions and ridicules him for working in retail. Joe sees Peach as another obstacle in his relationship with Beck, so follows her in Central Park and hits her with a rock at the back of her head. He later kills her after she invites Beck to a retreat at the Salinger estate in Greenwich, framing her death as a suicide. Beck returns to therapy to deal with her grief, and Joe becomes suspicious of her relationship with her therapist, Dr. Nicky (John Stamos). He attends therapy sessions with Dr. Nicky using a fake story. He initially plans to kill Dr. Nicky, but decides to give Beck space and begins dating Karen Minty (Natalie Paul), a friend of Claudia's. Beck misses Joe and pursues him again. After he breaks up with Karen, they begin another relationship. However, she grows suspicious when he continually avoids the topic of his ex-girlfriend, Candace. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Joe killed Elijah Thornton (Esteban Benito) after he discovered that Candace was sleeping with him in order to get a record deal at his company. Joe discovers that Beck slept with Dr. Nicky and confronts her. After Paco inadvertently exposes the location of a secret place Joe uses to hide things, Beck discovers a box in the ceiling of Joe's bathroom containing souvenirs and stolen items from her house, from Peach, and dental remains from Benji. She tries to escape, but Joe kidnaps her and traps her in the basement of his workplace. Beck writes a novel implicating Dr. Nicky in her murder to convince Joe that she understands him. He later leaves her again at night and kills Ron. Later, Paco helps Joe cover up Ron's murder because of how grateful he is. In his last conversation with Beck, Joe finally understands that Beck will never love him. Shortly after, he kills her. Months later, Beck's book is published and Dr. Nicky is incarcerated. Candace shows up at the bookstore, leaving Joe stunned. Season 2 After Candace's return, she explains how she survived the night that Joe thought he killed her. She taunts Joe with her knowledge of his complicity in Beck's death and threatens him. After escaping from her grasp, Joe quickly heads to Los Angeles. At Los Angeles International Airport, he notices a public frenzy surrounding a famous stand-up comedian, Henderson (Chris D'Elia). Joe later encounters Will Bettelheim, (Robin Lord Taylor) a hacker from a Craigslist meeting. When Will cannot create an untraceable identity for him, Joe kidnaps Will and imprisons him in a plexiglass vault hidden in a storage facility. Using Will's name, Joe secures an apartment and befriends the building manager and neighbor, Delilah Alves (Carmela Zumbado) and her teenage sister, Ellie Alves (Jenna Ortega). Joe meets Calvin (Adwin Brown), the manager of a trendy family-owned, health-conscious grocery store, Anavrin, and is hired as a clerk in the book cafe of the store. Joe then meets Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti), a widow who works in the kitchen and her addict-riddled brother, Forty Quinn (James Scully). Love makes advances on Joe, but he initially resists. They meet again and Love believes that their encounters are attributable to fate. It is revealed that Joe manipulated circumstances to get his job and apartment and secretly orchestrated his encounter with Love. Joe corresponds with a man named Jasper Krenn (Steven W. Bailey), who is after the real Will Bettelheim for money. Joe promises to deliver, but Jasper pins him down and severs the tip of one of his fingers. Jasper explains that if Joe can stop the bleeding, he'll have about 12 hours to get his fingertip reattached and that he will keep the fingertip in a cooler as ransom. Will instructs Joe to go to a house party at San Fernando Valley in order to retrieve cash from a man named Rufus. Before heading to the party, Joe cancels his invite to Love's lunch gathering with her friends. Later, Joe finds Rufus, but he offers him a bag of pills instead of cash. Joe later lures Jasper to his storage facility and kills him. He has his fingertip reattached and then dismembers and disposes of Jasper's body. Love confronts Joe, revealing that she has uncovered his lies through talking with her brother Forty. He later apologizes and they decided to just be friends for the moment. Joe tries to resist his growing attraction to Love and befriends Forty as a distraction. When Forty has a meltdown at a party, Joe calls Love to assist and they later begin a sexual relationship. But Joe's relationship with Love is challenged by Forty's emotional dependency. Delilah tells Joe she was drugged and raped as a teenager by Henderson. Joe later catches Ellie hanging out with Henderson and promises to protect her from the predator, having already secretly installed a control chip in her cell phone. He infiltrates a party at Henderson's house and steals his laptop. After giving Will the pills, Joe has him go through the laptop but finds nothing. He later learns from Forty that there is a secret room in Henderson's place. Will gives him information that allows him to enter the room, and Joe finds photos of unconscious women, including Delilah. Joe discovers Ellie has disabled the chip on her phone and is heading to Henderson's house. Joe spikes his drink with GBH, then tortures him. Henderson attempts to escape, and Joe knocks him down the stairs, killing him. Joe is later confronted by Delilah‚Äôs cop friend, David Fincher (Danny Vasquez) who catches him for jaywalking, but lets him go with a warning. Back at the vault, Joe frees Will after he promises to disappear and not report him. Forty tells Love he has met a woman named Amy Adam, who turns out to be Candace, who has tracked Joe down seeking revenge. Love, Joe, Forty and Candace attend a wellness retreat with Love and Forty's family. After Forty has another breakdown and Love confronts her mother, she confides in Joe about Forty's childhood sexual assault. Joe opens up his father's physical abuse and Joe and Love feel closer than ever. However, Candace warns Joe that the truth will come out and it is revealed that she has convinced Forty to write a script based on Beck's novel. Love becomes suspicious of Candace's behavior and hires a private investigator to follow her. He goes to her apartment to kill her, but she goes to his apartment, where she exposes the truth about his past to Candace. When he returns, Love confronts him but he convinces her that he left New York to escape Candace's lies, but they later break up. Joe and Delilah have a short-lived fling and Love begins an affair with Milo Warrington (Andrew Creer), her late husband's best friend. Joe and Delilah are arrested for lewd conduct in public, but Joe manages to get Forty to use his connections to get them out of jail. When Fincher reveals his suspicions about Joe to Delilah, she takes his keys and goes to his storage facility. He finds her there and locks her in the vault. Before he can return, Forty sets up an elaborate self-abduction scheme by locking himself, Joe and Ellie in a hotel room to fix his script. He eventually drugs Joe with LSD. Joe and Love reconcile, and Love convinces him to stay in Los Angeles. Forty eventually finishes the script, correctly inferring that Beck's ex killed her in a crime of passion. Forty confesses to Joe that as a young man he killed the au pair who assaulted him as a child. By the time Joe returns to the storage unit he finds Delilah dead. He later gets a call from Will, who did not report him but took a trip to Manila. Candace discovers the location of the vault and arrives to find Joe with Delilah's corpse. She locks him in the vault and calls Love to prove that Joe is a dangerous killer. Joe decides to confess the whole truth to Love, who reacts unexpectedly, luring Candace away from the vault and killing her to prevent her from calling the police. Love reveals to Joe, that she created the conditions to make him fall in love with her. She mentions that she was the one who killed Forty's child rapist and framed him for the murder. She also reveals that she killed Delilah to prevent Joe from being forced to flee. Love explains that she intends to frame Ellie for Henderson's murder, fake Delilah's death as a suicide, and build a new family with Joe and Forty. Alarmed at Love's machinations, Joe tries to kill her, but stops when she divulges that she's pregnant. Forty continues to uncover the real mystery of Beck's murder and interviews Dr. Nicky at a correctional facility. He uncovers the truth and heads back to try to get Love away from Joe, saying he is a serial killer. Forty claims that his sister has always been crazy, and is then killed by Fincher just before he manages to kill Joe. Love uses the power of her family to clean up Joe's criminal record and frames her deceased brother for the murder of Henderson. By the end of the season, Joe has returned to his obsessive nature, and, after moving in with Love in a suburban house, begins plotting a way to get to a new neighbor. Development In 2014, Caroline Kepnes released her first novel of the thriller series, You. The author stated that her inspiration for creating the character of Joe Goldberg stemmed from a personal loss. Kepnes explained the darkness of You, which deconstructs the romantic-comedy tropes highlighted in many films and shows, by making the protagonist, a violent stalker and serial killer, saying it was written in a dark period of her life, the year her father died of cancer, and in which she experienced several other personal challenges. Later, Kepnes was initially hesitant on labeling Joe, as a few readers argued that his actions, classified him as a serial killer. The author then, clarified her position on the matter, citing that \\"I remember when I wrote You and someone first referred to Joe as a serial killer. I argued 'he‚Äôs not a serial killer, he meets these terrible people and has these awful thoughts, but he‚Äôs very sensitive'. It‚Äôs very strange to realise you have written a serial killer.\\" Sera Gamble, the showrunner and co-creator of the television adaptation mentioned in an interview with Collider, that when envisioning Joe, the main protagonist of the series, she wanted to delve deeply into the root cause of the pathology of his behavior that shaped his amoral position to justify and rationalize stalking, kidnapping and killing his victims. When she was writing the character, she stated that \\"I want to understand what coaxes behavior of this nature out of that very tiny percentage of men. I like to think it‚Äôs a very tiny percentage of men who would cross a line like the line that Joe Goldberg crosses\\". In an interview at The Contenders Emmys 2019 panel, Gamble highlighted the importance of casting the right person to play the role of Joe Goldberg. She stated that \\"it had to be a love story and a horror movie in every single scene\\", further adding that if they \\"cast someone who was sort of creepy, then the story wouldn‚Äôt work; the idea is that it‚Äôs a lead in a romantic comedy who works in a bookstore and a woman walks in, they have a cute meet and fall in love and live happily ever after. That‚Äôs the show.\\" Expanding on her commentary on the show's themes and origin, Gamble stated at The Hollywood Reporter's roundtable interview, that she was not surprised to hear an overwhelming reception to Joe's character amongst online fans and viewers, citing that \\"There's a very vocal contingent of fans of Caroline Kepnes' book [on which You is based] who were like, \\"I heart Joe.\\" Essentially what she's done is taken the classic romantic hero and just peeled back the gloss and sheen and John Cusack with the boombox and she followed it to its logical conclusion. I mean, if you turn off the sappy music and turn on a David Fincher score, romantic comedies are stalker movies. The plot of pretty much every one I can think of ‚Äî and we have watched all of them many times in the writers room ‚Äî is contingent on the guy ‚Ä¶ well, first of all, he has to do a certain amount of fucking up so she can forgive him. And he has to get over some of her shortcomings. I mean, that's love, right? But also, he's chasing her through a fucking airport, chasing her on a freeway, watching her sleep because he feels protective. Romantic comedy behavior in real life is criminal! And that was basically the starting place for the show.\\" Portrayal Penn Badgley was cast in the lead character of Joe Goldberg in June 2017. Prior to the show's premiere, Badgley mentioned his disinterest in playing the character of Joe Goldberg in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying that \\"I didn‚Äôt want to do it ‚Äî it was too much. I was conflicted with the nature of the role. If this is a love story, what is it saying? It‚Äôs not an average show; it‚Äôs a social experiment.\\" However, he was strongly convinced by the script and the social commentary around the series, adding that \\"what was key in me wanting to jump on board were my conversations with Greg Berlanti and Sera Gamble, the creators, and understanding Joe‚Äôs humanity. I knew that I would be conflicted about the role from day one till the last day, and that is why they thought I would be good for it, is that I‚Äôm not psyched to play somebody of this nature.\\" Relaying similar thoughts in an interview with GQ, Badgley again raised his concerns of portraying Joe, noting that he was first apprehensive at the role but later changed his mind, expressing that \\"no one in any position of authority could ever try to act as though we don‚Äôt know that sex and murder sells, but how can it work in a different way we‚Äôve not seen? That‚Äôs where I think this show does something that none of us could have said for certain that we would nail. It could have been really irresponsible. It could have fallen flat and been like, whoa.\\" In another interview at The Contenders Emmys 2019 panel, Badgley mentioned that his character was \\"the hero of his own story...every serial killer is\\" but added that Joe is \\"ultimately, the word that‚Äôs coming to mind is un-saveable\\". The actor highlighted that though, there is an apparent affinity to Joe's character, it is somewhat of a \\"Rorschach test of a kind for us,\\" adding that \\"we‚Äôre failing...\\" Reception Penn Badgley at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival Critical response Penn Badgley's portrayal of Joe Goldberg has received critical acclaim. Many reviewers gave praise to Penn Badgley's performance and comparing the eerie tone and terrifying approach established in the series to the themes of violence and stalking, reminiscent in contemporary thriller films and series like Dexter, Gone Girl and American Psycho. Certain reviewers have also highlighted that the series provides an alluring but, disturbing insight into the mind and profile of a psychopath, who charmingly manipulates his way through his anti-hero charisma, motives and warped sense of morality, in order to convince the audience \\"to sympathize with a stalker\\" and \\"serial killer\\". Alicia Lutes of IGN gave praise to Badgley's performance in her review of the series, highlighting that he is \\"doing some of his best, most unhinged work in the series. His charming nature and playful face are the perfect, twisted mask for the ‚ÄúNice Guy With Control Issues‚Äù lurking underneath\\" and further adding that \\"Joe‚Äôs inner monologue frames the series in a way that shows just how malcontented a guy he really is despite his warm smile and cool demeanor.\\" Tiffany Kelly from Daily Dot praised the performance of Badgley in her review of the series by stating that he \\"shines as a bookstore manager and bone-chilling stalker in this surprisingly good thriller.\\" While reviewing the first season, Anna Leszkiewicz from New Statesman praised Penn Badgley's performance, by declaring that the \\"Netflix series You does what it says on the tin ‚Äì offering surprise twists, drip-fed reveals, a magnetic villain in Joe, the horrible suspense of knowing more than his clueless victims and satisfyingly gory murders.\\" Christina Radish of Collider named Joe Goldberg as the \\"Best TV Villain\\" of 2018. Radish wrote that, \\"thanks to the performance given by Penn Badgley and some terrific writing, the character has layers that make him complicated and intriguing, even though you know he should be making you cringe and recoil. Joe Goldberg is a character that does horrible things, but also keeps you so engrossed that you can't stop watching.\\" Tilly Pearce from Metro gave high praise to the actor's performance in the second season, noting that \\"Penn Badgley is perfect in this role, as is Victoria Pedretti, and we can‚Äôt wait to see what season three (assuming it happens) brings.\\" Samantha Highfill from Entertainment Weekly mentioned You in her wish list of contenders for the 2019 Emmy Nominations. Praising Badgley's performance, she notes that the series \\"presented a different look at a serial killer, one that took viewers inside the mind of Joe Goldberg, thereby presenting them with the reasoning for his actions. By never shying away from Joe‚Äôs dark side, the show‚Äôs freshman season unraveled a beautifully paced modern-day thriller about what people do for love‚Ä¶and what is acceptable to do for love.\\" Team TVLine ranked the performances of Penn Badgley and Victoria Pedretti at the top of The TVLine Performers of the Week list. Praising the two, the team notes that \\"embodying a sympathetic serial killer is no easy feat, yet Penn Badgley has spent the past two seasons of You making the process appear effortless. And just as his character, Joe Goldberg, finally met his match this season in the form of a woman named Love, so too has Badgley found the perfect on-screen companion in Love‚Äôs portrayer, Victoria Pedretti.\\" References Category:American male characters in television Category:Characters in American novels of the 21st century Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Fictional kidnappers Category:Fictional serial killers Category:Fictional stalkers Category:Fictional torturers Category:Fictional victims of child abuse Category:Literary characters introduced in 2014 Category:Male characters in literature Category:Orphan characters in literature Category:Television characters introduced in 2018 ","title":"Joe Goldberg"},{"id":"60041968","text":"The Agriculture of the Tongan Archipelago is largely based on the farming of yams, squash, and root crops. Agriculture consists of 16‚Äì29.9% of Tonga's GDP, 34% of its labour force, and about 50% of its exports. Since the 1980s, Tonga's agricultural exports expanded to include vanilla, watermelons, sugar, and legumes. With the expansion of the archipelago's population, climate change, and competitive markets, Tonga has trouble keeping up with competitive demand.  History   Traditional Farming  In the past, Tonga had a subsistence based system of agriculture called shifting cultivation and fallowing, which eventually evolved to create a tax system that paid nobles and the monarchy in yams. Yams were considered the \\"'noblest crop'\\", and were farmed primarily for the monarchs and nobility as well as the annual common feast of Inasi. Before British and European influence in Tonga, there were no markets. The Tongan calendar was based on the lunar cycle and the rotation of crops (the Tongan words for \\"year\\" and \\"crop of yams\\" are the same, ta'u), causing there to be 13 months in a year, approximately starting on November 6, and ending sometime between late October and early November. In shifting cultivation and fallowing, one plot of vegetated land would undergo slashing and burning, be cultivated and have crops planted, and then be left fallow for two to four years. The cycle begins with yams, alocasia, and plantains- which are left to grow from eight to nine months to two to three years before they are harvested and have the next crops planted in their place. For the next four to six months come the sweet potatoes, which are then succeeded by xanthosoma for ten to twelve months, which is finally replaced by the hardy cassava plant for a year.  Modern Farming  First Niuatoputapu Agricultural Farm at 'Ahofakataha - experimental yam garden Following European influence, subsistence farming has been replaced by what is called \\"semi- permanent\\", or commercial farming. Although Tonga lacks connectivity between its islands and advanced agricultural technologies, it retains its status as a prominent producer of crops for East Asian and Oceanian countries. Today, Tonga produces 60% of New Zealand's watermelon imports, and has been producing squash for Japan and South Korea since the mid-1980s, although overproduction of the crop has greatly reduced its value and thus the amount of squash produced.

History Initial development Of the first 14 publicly available electricity supplies in New Zealand, seven were in the province of Taranaki. Most of these were hydroelectric schemes, utilizing the seasonally consistent water supply provided by Mount Taranaki‚Äôs many streams. This development was driven by the demand for electric lighting by both town and rural dwellers plus farmers wishing to power their new electric shearing sheds, milking machines and separator. In the late 19th century the New Plymouth Borough Council decided to investigate its options for constructing a hydro-electric power station to supply the town with electricity as well as providing a water supply. The nearby Waiwhakaiho River was identified as a suitable source of water. In 1898 a completion was held to design a scheme. The completion was judged by respected engineer Richard Liron Mestayer (1843 - 1921). The council decided not to proceed with any of the schemes put forward and instead engaged Mestayer in 1901 to design his own scheme, which was subsequently accepted. His design called for an intake on the Waiwhakaiho River from which water was conveyed to a powerhouse first by a tunnel that passed under the Mangamahoe Stream to a forebay on the hill, from which a diameter steel penstock conveyed the water down to a manifold outside of the station from where the water was split to supply two turbines. Construction begins Mestayer's design was accepted, which lead to a construction contract being issued on 13 July 1903 to McWilliams and Andrews to build the scheme. The tunnel was dug from the outlet, from a side drive about 16 chains (322 metres) from the outlet, and from a deep shaft about 21 chains (422 metres) from the outlet. From the side drive and also from the shaft the tunnel was driven in both directions. The alignment of the tunnel was laid out on the surface by Sladden & Palmer, Civil Engineers and Surveyors, and then transferred to the bottom of the shaft by means of heavy plumb bobs suspended from the top by very fine wires, with the plumb bobs themselves hanging in buckets of water to dampen their movement. The line thus transferred was produced in both directions by means of a theodolite. The line was marked inside the tunnel by iron spikes driven into the roof, and from which plumb bobs were suspended to guide the excavation. The levels were transferred from, the surface to the bottom of the shaft using a long steel tape, and then maintained as the work progressed by means of an engineer's level. The power scheme received a licence from the government to generate electricity on 24 February 1905, and was completed in late 1905. The first electricity was received in New Plymouth in January 1906, with 120 street lamps and the town hall being lit. By the end of the year the power station which operated from dusk to midnight was supplying 41 customers. By 1907 demand had increased with the power station supplying 126 customers and 230 by 1912. The power station originally had two turbines each driving a 45 kW single-phase generator. To meet increasing demand the station was enlarged under the supervision of borough engineer A.H. Kendall to accommodate an additional 150 hp turbine driving a 90 kW single-phase generator, which entered service in December 1907. Expansion With no storage capacity the 180 kW power station was strictly run of the river and was proving to be unreliable during periods of low summer flow. The growth of the town, and the impending introduction of electric powered trams necessitated the need for more generation, as well as providing more water for water reticulation purposes. As a result, the council in 1909 employed Henry Westcott Clime, the principal of consulting engineers H.W. Clime & Son to investigate possible options. Climie identified that the generation output was limited by the size of the tunnel, which couldn't be taken out of service and enlarged without cutting off the power supply to the town. He offered three options, (a) build a weir across the Waiwhakaiho below the present intake so as to give a greater head of water; (b) divert a portion of the water from the Waiwhakaiho, at a point about thirty chains above the present intake, by means of a tunnel and open race into the Mangamahoe Stream, and build a dam across the latter a little below where the present tunnel passes under it, or (c) take the water off the Waiwhakaiho at the same point as proposed in (b) and convey it by means of a larger new tunnel through the hill to the power station. Climie's recommended option was (a) which he calculated would give an effective 876 hp, equivalent to nearly 660 kilowatts of electrical energy at an estimated cost of ¬£5,137 for the civil works plus the cost of the additional turbines and generators. The council initially opted for option (a) but an inability to install a suitable foundation and a large flood caused this to be abandoned in favour of Climie's Option (c) which involved construction on the Waiwhakaiho River of a new intake 25 chains (502 m) further upstream, which diverted water by means of a 22 chain (442 m) long water race, of which consists of a tunnel into the Mangamahoe Stream, where a 13 ft (3.96 m) high concrete gravity dam was constructed in 1914, just downstream of where the original tunnel had crossed it. Filling of the lake began in November 1914. From the dam the water was taken to a forebay, from where it entered the powerhouse, and the reticulation pipes of the town. This new diversion which cost approximately ¬£4,000, captured not only water from the Waiwhakaiho but also all of the flow of Mangamahoe. As a result of the increased flow the total output of the power station increased to 750 kW. The new intake proved difficult to maintain as it frequently became blocked with large stones, gravel and branches which then had to be manually removed. As a result, improvements were made to its design which were completed on 16 January 1916. At the same time as efforts were being made to increase the supply of water two 250 kW generators ordered from Turnbull and Jones entered service in 1912 and 1913. In 1914 the original two 45 kW generators were replaced by a new 250 kW generator. In 1915 the council converted the transmission and distribution voltage on its system to 6.6 kV single-phase, which was upgraded in 1921 to three-phase. Damage to and replacement of the dam On 25 March 1917 the bed of the Mangamahoe River was seriously scoured out immediately from under the tunnel where it passed under the dam to a depth of to , which caused all of the water in the dam to be lost. A temporary sack dam was erected behind the breach which allowed an approximately 3ft 6in (1.1 metre) head to be obtained in the reservoir. However it was difficult to regulate the flow of water while trying to avoid the risk of carrying away the dam at another place. Rather than repair the damage which would have meant closing down the tunnel and to restricting the town's demand (including closing down the tramways and turning off the street lighting) to what could be supplied via a tie line from the Taranaki Electric Power Board it was decided to build a new dam downstream of the existing dam. A design for a new concrete dam which would give a higher head than the existing dam was submitted to the council on 23 May 1917 and approved. The new dam was long at the top, high with a bottom thickness of and a top thickness of widened by cornices to 2ft 6in (760 mm), to form a footway, which extends over the by-wash in two 13 ft 6 in (4.1 m) spans. This footbridge and the scour-valve platform were the only portions of the dam in which steel reinforcement was installed. The spillway was widened to . No great difficulties were met during construction, except that it was necessary dig to lower than originally intended in order to find a hard, and watertight bottom which was found to extend for in length from the north end to the centre of the stream. Beyond this to the south end of the wall the excavation was taken down to a depth of from to lower than originally intended. A cast-iron gate valve was installed to allow emptying and letting sand out of the lake. By February 1918 the dam had finished and refilled with water. Mason's proposal With the demand for electricity within the Borough of New Plymouth showing no sign of levelling off, and with applications for power been received from other local bodies, the council committed to expanding the Mangorei scheme. The council in late 1918 engaged consulting engineer John Blair Mason (1858 to 1927) of Blair Mason, Lee, Owen and Cree Brown, to investigate the various options. Mason offered a number of options but Scheme D which also had a partial option called E11 became the preferred choice of the council. Scheme D called for tapping the Waiwhakaiho River at a new upstream intake and conveying the water via a tunnel to a lake created by a new high dam on the Mangamahoe Stream about 30 chains (603 m) above the existing dam. This high dam would give a head of above the powerhouse, submerge at least 30 acres (12 hectares) and with a draw off would provide 13,000,000 cubic feet (368,000 cubic metres) of storage. The lake would rise above the saddle about half a mile (800 m) south of a forebay from whence it would be conveyed by water races and penstocks to the powerhouse. The actual storage required with a load factor of 0.45 to develop the maximum water power would amount to 7¬º million cubic ft (205,000 cubic metres). Mason estimated that this would give a maximum of 6,300 hp. His estimated cost for the project was ¬£46,000. Scheme E11 on the other hand he estimated would cost ¬£11,700, of which only ¬£1,300 need be regarded as temporary work, being the estimated cost of race and depreciation on pipe line. It involved constructing the weir, intake and tunnel portions of the permanent works of scheme D, which could reused if the council choose at a later date to proceed with the full scheme. From the outfall of the tunnel the water would be conveyed via a 140 chain (2,800 m) long water race to a penstock above the present forebay. From here up to 100 cusecs (2.8 cumecs) would be delivered to the powerhouse through new penstocks. Over the next two years the plan were modified, with scheme D being renamed Scheme 1, with a dam now giving a head, which would submerge 95 acres (38 hectares) and have a capacity of 50 million cubic feet (1.4 million cubic metres) with a draw off. This would require the building of two long embankments on the South side of the proposed reservoir to prevent the water overflowing the adjacent lands. There would also be three penstocks running from the forebay/surge chamber to the powerhouse. This scheme was expected to develop 9,000 hp. The partial scheme now known as E2 was basically as per Mason's but had an increased head and flow of 150 cusec which it was expected would produce an additional 2,000 hp on top of the power station's existing 900 hp. The council made the decision in 1919 to proceed with the partial scheme. However its estimated cost had to the council's enormous disappointment increased by January 1920 to ¬£112,000 and which they expected to make an annual profit of ¬£13,800 on the electricity being generated. The loans to service this expenditure were approved by ratepayers. In October 1920, the estimate was further increased to ¬£172,000 (which included contingencies of ¬£12,000) with an expected annual profit on the electricity being generated dropping to ¬£6,042. As a result, the council in November 1920 with approximately ¬£60,000 already spent to date reluctantly had to go back to ratepayers to obtain approval to raise another ¬£60,000 loan. The partial scheme The partial scheme as completed in early 1923. had a diversion weir and intake about a mile and a half above the previous intake. The new concrete diversion intake on the Waiwhakaiho River had a base 15 ft below the river level and rose to about 12 ft above the normal height of the river. it was divided into four valve chambers, with three ports open to the river on one face, and one on the other face of the intake. These could be opened or closed by gates as required. From the intake the water was conveyed through the 1,800 ft (548 m) long Tunnel No. 1. A few feet of this tunnel was driven from the intake end, but the principal excavation work was being done from the opposite end of the tunnel. The haulage of the spoil from the driving was undertaken by pony-drawn trucks. The tunnel was light by electricity with airshafts at regular intervals. The excavation of the tunnel which was estimated to cost approximately ¬£12,000 was undertaken by Payne and Blanchard Ltd using a workforce that varied between 13 and 25 men working in three shifts. At the exit of Tunnel No.1 a small high dam (which was termed a \\"Turning Wall\\") with a concrete core was built to deflect the water into Water Race No. 1. This long race terminated at a 558 ft (170 m) long pipeline which took the water over the Mangamahoe Stream below to the long Water Race No. 2. This race then transitioned to 4,000 ft (1,219 m) long Tunnel No.2 which took it to a forebay/surge chamber 140 ft (42.7 m) higher up the hill than the existing surge chamber. From here a steel penstock conveyed the water down to the powerhouse. This improved supply of water and increased head of allowed the council to install two new 1,000 kVA generators, convert one of the existing 250 kW machines, to produce 750 kVA, and replace another 250 kW unit with a new 1,000 kVA unit. Defects were found in Tunnel No.2 which led the council in 1923 to dismiss their consulting engineers Blair Mason, Lee, Owen and Cree Brown, who had been responsible for overseeing all civil works. The council's electrical department was responsible for the electrical work. On 27 April 1928 approximately of the southern end of the pipeline that carried water across the Mangamahoe Stream was destroyed by a landslide, which cut off the water supply to the power station for approximately two weeks until it was repaired. Until it was the supply the street light lighting and trams were switched off and New Plymouth's demand was restricted to what could be supplied via a tie line from the Taranaki Electric Power Board. Creation of Lake Mangamahoe As demand continued to rise and aware of the benefits of having a larger reservoir that would provide both generation storage capacity as well as delivering a reliable water supply to New Plymouth, the council committed to undertaking the full scheme by building a dam on the Mangamahoe Stream. The contract to build the dam was won by J. T. Julian and Son in March 1929 with a price of ¬£35,310 7s 6d. Construction started in 1929 with the diversion of the stream through a tunnel on the left abutment. The foundations for the dam were then excavated and a trench dug for the concrete core. Mechanical earth moving was just starting to be employed in New Zealand, and as a result tractors and scrapers were used to construct the dam. The dam when finished in 1931 submerged approximately 79 acres (32 hectares) of land to form Lake Mangamahoe. At the time of its completion the dam was the highest earth dam in Australasia. The existing two water races and the pipeline over the Mangamahoe Stream were left in place and flooded by the lake. By March 1948 the various modifications to the power station had resulted in it having an output of 3,750 kW, which was provided by one 90 kW, one 240 kW, one 750 kVA and three 1,000 kW generators. On 1 September 1983 the power station was added to the New Zealand Historic Places list as a Historic Place Category 2. Changes in ownership As a result of the restructuring of the New Zealand electricity sector in the early 1990s, the electricity department of the New Plymouth City Council (trading as New Plymouth Energy) merged with the Taranaki Electric Power Board on 7 May 1993 to form Taranaki Energy Ltd. In 1995 Taranaki Energy Ltd merged with and took the name of Powerco. The introduction of the Electricity Industry Reform Act in 1998 required New Zealand's electricity companies to separate their network and retail businesses. As a result, Powerco having elected to remain a network company sold its five power stations (which including Mangorei) to Trustpower. Improvements In recent years Trustpower has undertaken extensive work on the linings of the supply tunnel to reduce friction. Design A weir on the Waiwhakaiho River diverts water into the , 7 ft 3 inch (2.2 m) diameter concrete lined Tunnel No.1 which conveys it to the top of Lake Mangamahoe. This manmade lake was created by a dam at its northern end which impounds the Mangamahoe Stream above its confluence with the Waiwhakaiho River. The 27.4-metre-high earth dam, which is 160 m long at the crest, has a substantial curved concrete core running throughout its centre and set into the hard sandstone on each bank and is at least 6 m thick. The lake side has a 3-to-1 slope, with the surface exposed to the water surface lined with stone, while the downstream side has a 2-to-1 slope. To the west of it is an intake structure with four remotely controlled intake gates. From the intake structure the 4,000-foot-long (1,219 m), 7-foot-3-inch-diameter (2.2 m) Tunnel No.2 conveys the water from the lake to a 37-foot-diameter (11.2 m) forebay/surge chamber. From the forebay/surge chamber two steel penstocks carry the water down to the powerhouse which is located on Hydro Rd (S.H.3), Mangorei. In the powerhouse are one 700 kW generator and three 1.3 MW generators. The generators discharge into a tailrace which flows into the Waiwhakaiho River, approximately six kilometres down stream of the intake. Water is also taken via two intakes on the lake's western shore to a nearby water treatment plant, from where it is distributed to consumers in the New Plymouth area. Operation Resource consents which were granted in 1996 and which expire in June 2021 allow the power station to divert up to 10 cumecs of water from the Waiwhakaiho River and back into it. The power station is required to maintain a minimum flow in the river below the diversion weir. Lake Mangamahoe also serves as the water supply for New Plymouth and is a Wildlife Refuge. A trap and transfer programme manages any disruption to the migration of longfin eel. The power station is embedded in Powerco's network behind Transpower's Carrington Street Substation. The power station is operated remotely via a SCADA system from Trustpower's control centre in Tauranga.

He appeared as a radiological technologist in a scene from the 1973 horror film The Exorcist, which was inspired when the film's director, William Friedkin, watched him perform a cerebral angiography the previous year. The scene, with a considerable amount of blood onscreen, was, for many viewers, the film's most disturbing scene; medical professionals have praised it for its realism. In 1979, Bateson was convicted of the murder of film industry journalist Addison Verrill and sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in prison; in 2003 he was released on parole, which ended after five years. Prior to Bateson's trial, police and prosecutors implicated him in a series of unsolved slayings of gay men in Manhattan, killings he had reportedly boasted about while in jail, bringing it up at his sentencing. However, no additional charges ever were brought against him. The experience inspired Friedkin to make the 1980 film Cruising which, while based on a novel written a decade earlier, incorporated in its storyline the city's leather subculture, with which Bateson had identified. In 2012, Friedkin recalled having visited the jailed Bateson prior to his trial, and having a conversation which suggested that either Bateson had committed the additional murders or merely that he was considering confessing to them for a lighter sentence. However, there is no other record of incriminating evidence mentioned by Friedkin in that interview. Despite this, Bateson is often inaccurately described as a serial killer. , it is not known if Bateson is still alive or, if he is, where he is living. Friedkin said in a 2018 interview that he had heard Bateson was living somewhere in upstate New York. A Social Security record shows that a \\"Paul F. Bateson\\" with the same birthdate and a Social Security number issued in Pennsylvania, died on September 15, 2012. Early life and career Bateson was born on August 24, 1940Search on \\"Paul F Bateson\\", inmate #79A1383, at and grew up in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, the son of a metallurgist. He would later suggest that his appearance in The Exorcist was revenge on his father for punishing him as a child by making him stay home from Saturday matin√©es at the local movie theater and listen to opera on the radio instead. He served in the Army in the early 1960s, where he began drinking heavily out of boredom while stationed in Germany, beginning a lifetime struggle with alcoholism. After his discharge, he returned to Lansdale and stopped drinking. In 1964 he moved to New York City, where he began a relationship with a man (he would later describe himself as \\"not exclusively gay\\") who he said was \\"involved in music\\". The relationship was marked by heavy drinking, either in the form of cocktails at The Pierre and frequent parties at the couple's home, as well as weekends in the Fire Island enclave of Cherry Grove, both with food cooked by Bateson. Five years later, Bateson's mother died of a stroke and his younger brother died by suicide. Bateson trained as a neurological radiological technician and began working in that capacity. After the relationship ended in 1973, he moved to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Borough Park. He commuted from there to his job at New York University Medical Center (NYUMC), where he was well-liked and respected by his colleagues. The Exorcist In late 1972, film director William Friedkin visited NYUMC while he was preparing to make The Exorcist, the film adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel of that name. He wanted to view some medical procedures since he was considering showing some in the film. He was also looking for staff who might be willing to be extras in the film, since he would be shooting interiors in New York although the film itself is set in Washington, D.C. Dr. Barton Lane invited the director to watch a cerebral angiography. At the time, such angiographies were performed by puncturing the patient's carotid artery (in the front of the neck) in order to insert a catheter through which a contrast agent was injected in order to make the patient's blood vessels more visible under X-rays. In the moments between the arterial puncture and the insertion of the catheter, blood freely issued from the tube mouth in rhythm with the patient's heartbeat. Friedkin was sufficiently impressed that he told Lane immediately afterward that not only did he want to depict the procedure in his film, he wanted Lane to be the one performing it on camera, along with the nurse and Bateson, the technician, who, recalled Lane in 2018, was the best he had ever had. A few months later, Friedkin and his crew returned to shoot the scene, blocking off part of the hospital's radiology department for two successive weekends. It was one of the first scenes shot during principal photography, in which the character of Regan (Linda Blair) is examined medically to see if any of the strange behavior (later found to be the result of demonic possession) she has been exhibiting can be scientifically explained. Lane later recalled hearing that the crew was still trying to figure out how to make Regan's head spin for a scene later on in the film that, like the angiogram, became one of the film's best-remembered moments. In the scene, it is Bateson who speaks most of the dialogue, demonstrating the calming bedside manner, another attribute that drew praise from those he worked alongside, that he had used with many actual child patients. He can be seen in the background early, as Regan is wheeled into the room, helping put her on the table and attaching wires to her shoulders. As the film shows Regan's face in tight closeup, alternating with takes of the procedure being finished, including her blood spurting into the air and staining her surgical gown as it had in the procedure Friedkin watched, Bateson's voice is heard off-camera, instructing her, warning her that the carotid puncture will hurt and reassuring her as she winces immediately afterward. Upon The Exorcist release at the end of 1973, the scene became notorious as the one that audiences found most disturbing, despite its lack of any of the supernatural content that underlies the rest of the film's horror elements. Medical professionals, including Lane and the others involved in the scene, have also praised it as a realistic depiction of the procedure, of special historic interest since it is no longer performed with a carotid puncture, and one of the most realistic depictions of any medical procedure in a popular film. 1973‚Äì1977 Around the time The Exorcist was released, Bateson's drinking again increased, adversely affecting his social life. \\"Nobody likes a drunk\\", he later told The Village Voice. In 1975 it affected his job performance, and NYUMC let him go. Bateson sustained himself with odd jobs, such as doing light repair work and cleaning in apartments near where he now lived in Greenwich Village, and taking tickets at a theater showing pornographic films. He also went to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and was successful for a while in staying sober. He socialized with other recovering alcoholic gay men and was hoping to start another long-term relationship. However, by 1977 Bateson had begun drinking again, more heavily. He said later that he was drinking at least a quart (0.95 L) of vodka a day, which made him passive and curtailed his social life again. \\"After a few shots, I'd shave and get dressed\\", intending to go out. But then after the vodka, \\"[I] had no energy left to move\\". On those nights when he was able to go out, Bateson patronized leather bars, something he had started doing back in 1970 with a group that styled themselves as bikers. \\"Leather impresses me\\", he said later, contrasting it with drag and swish. \\"They give gays a bad name, like any extreme group would\\". Murder of Addison Verrill On September 14, 1977, Addison Verrill, a reporter who covered the film industry for Variety, was found dead in his Horatio Street apartment. He had been beaten and stabbed; there were some signs of a struggle. However, nothing of value had been taken. Police believed that if the killer's motive had been robbery, he might have been looking for cash or jewelry since those could be taken quickly. There was no evidence of forced entry. Verrill had likely let his killer in to the apartment; there were several empty beer cans and half-full liquor glasses at the scene. Gay activist and journalist Arthur Bell, a friend of Verrill's, wrote an article about the case in The Village Voice setting it against the larger issue of how murders of gay men, several of which occurred yearly in the Village, were rarely taken seriously by police or reported on in the media since they were seen as the results of sexual encounters gone wrong. The police, Bell wrote, had learned that Verrill had been at the Mineshaft, a popular leather bar, until 6 a.m., talking to many other patrons. According to Bell, Verrill's friends said that while he did not seek the kink that was abundant at the Mineshaft, he nevertheless \\"liked the attitudes\\" of many of the customers. He was considered a regular, holding court at a corner table, not only at the Mineshaft but the Anvil, another popular leather bar, and other popular gay bars of the era. His presence was seen as making those bars popular. Phone calls, confession, and arrest Bell ended his article by giving the phone number of the New York Police Department's homicide bureau and asking anyone with information to call them. However, eight days after the killing someone called him claiming to be the killer, apparently to correct Bell's assumption that the killer was a psychopath who targeted gays. \\"I like your story and I like your writing\\", the caller told him, \\"but I'm not a psychopath\\". In a story that ran on the Voice front page, the caller recounted the events of the night that ended in Verrill's murder. \\"I'm gay and I needed money and I'm an alcoholic\\", he said. After three months of sobriety, he claimed, he had gone out to Badlands, a Christopher Street bar, in the early hours of September 14 where Verrill, whom he did not know, offered to buy him a beer, a proposition the caller accepted. That beer became several, with the two consuming poppers and cocaine in addition to the drinks. At 3 a.m., they left Badlands and went to the Mineshaft, where they continued their alcohol and drug consumption. The caller told Bell he was impressed by how popular his companion was. \\"I didn't realize he was such a superstar, and I wanted to go home with him\\". After two hours, they took a taxi to Verrill's apartment, something the caller said Verrill was reluctant to do because he had to get up early and work on a story. There the two had more alcohol and cocaine, followed by sex at 7:30 a.m. The caller said that afterwards he realized that was as far as Verrill had wanted the relationship to go. \\"I needed money and I hated the rejection\\", so, still intoxicated, \\"I decided to do something I'd never done before\\". After incapacitating Verrill with a frying pan from his kitchen, the caller recounted, he stabbed the journalist with a knife, although he said he chose the wrong part of his chest. After the killing, the caller said, he took cash, totaling $57 ($ in modern dollars) and Verrill's Master Charge card, passport, and some clothes. He used the money to buy liquor and was consequently drunk for the entire next day. Bell confirmed with another source that the man had been seen at a popular bathhouse that night. The caller offered some information about himself besides that relevant to understanding the crime. He claimed to be the son of an orchestra leader, to have a wife in Berlin who did not understand his homosexuality, and a teenage son. He had an interest in the arts, and had wanted to be a dancer when he was younger. Bell noted that he talked about wanting to \\"atone\\" for the crime several times, which he connected to the conversation taking place on Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. \\"[B]ut I don't want to give myself up. I wouldn't be able to practice again. I'd lose my license\\". He declined to tell Bell what sort of practice the license was for, suggesting that would help identify him. When Bell contacted police about the call, they told him that it seemed like the first solid lead in the case. The caller had known about the stolen credit card, a detail police had not made public, and described a white substance found on the floor of Verrill's apartment as Crisco, a shortening frequently used at the time by gay men as a sexual lubricant. Police had not thus far been able to identify it and had also not made the information public. Detectives suspected the caller would call Bell again, and went to his apartment to wait with him. At 11 p.m. his phone rang; it was not the original caller but a man who identified himself as \\"Mitch\\". He told Bell the killer was Paul Bateson, whom he had gotten to know while the two were drying out at St. Vincent's Hospital a few months earlier. While he believed Bateson was not the man's real name, since he knew the man to have used the pseudonym \\"Johnny Johnson\\" at one point, he said Bateson was an unemployed X-ray technician and that he had called him earlier and confessed to the crime. Mitch asked to meet Bell in person, but the police told Bell not to do so. Instead, they just arrested Bateson at his East 12th Street apartment, where he was lying around drunk; when he was asked if he knew why he was being arrested, he pointed to an open copy of the Voice with Bell's article and indicated that that was probably why. A detective went to the bar and brought Mitch in for questioning as well; he was released after a few hours. Bateson eventually gave police a handwritten confession that was consistent with what he had told Bell. Arrest and jailhouse conversations Bateson was charged with second- degree murder and detained while awaiting trial. Bell interviewed Bateson in person a month later, visiting him at Rikers Island. Bateson talked generally about his life, something he said he did often (as did other acquaintances of Bateson whom Bell spoke with). Jail, he said, was helping him to again get sober; his biggest regret about being in custody was missing the new season of the Joffrey Ballet, at the time based in New York. Bell admitted that he, too, might have taken Bateson up on an offer to go to his apartment if he had met him in a bar rather than a jail. While Bateson avoided talking about the crime he was charged with (on what Bell supposed to be advice from his attorney) he did talk about the trial. He had pleaded not guilty and expected that to be the verdict after a long trial. \\"A lot of people will be hurt‚Äîparents, friends ... Then, I'll tear up my roots and settle somewhere else\\". Suspicion in serial killings At the time of Bateson's arrest, police had also been investigating a series of murders of gay men over the previous two years which they believed were committed by the same person due to similarities in the killings' modus operandi. Six corpses of men had been found, dismembered, in bags floating in the Hudson River. None of them have ever been identified, but police traced the clothes on them to shops in Greenwich Village that catered to the gay community. Since the bags reportedly had wording on them connecting them to NYUMC's neuropsychiatric unit, and the dismemberment of the bodies appeared to have been done by someone skilled in using a knife, investigators began to suggest publicly that Bateson might be a suspect in, as they were referred to officially, the \\"CUPPI\\" killings, for \\"Circumstances Unknown Pending Police Investigation\\", as well. Those killings were the subject of another interview Bateson gave, although it would not be made public until 2012. Friedkin, who recalled him from both his initial visit to NYUMC and the filming of the angiography for The Exorcist as a \\"nice young man\\" who stood out due to the earring and studded bracelet he wore, neither of which were common accessories for men at the time, read a long story about the case in the Daily News. Surprised that the gentle Bateson he recalled could have even been accused of a murder, Friedkin came to Rikers to talk with him after getting permission from Bateson's lawyer. In an interview with Mubi's The Notebook that coincided with the release of his film Killer Joe, Friedkin said Bateson admitted killing Verrill, although the director then incorrectly stated that Bateson had dismembered the body and thrown the bagged body parts in the river. Bateson said that the prosecutors were offering him a deal whereby if he confessed to the bag murders and some other unsolved killings he would receive a shortened sentence. He told Friedkin he was not sure if he would accept it. In a 2018 episode of The Hollywood Reporter \\"It Happened in Hollywood\\" podcast, Friedkin attributed to Bateson a confession to the unsolved murders. As a result of his conversation with Bateson, Friedkin decided it was time to make the film adaptation of New York Times reporter Gerald Walker's 1970 novel Cruising about an police officer going undercover in the gay community to catch a serial killer. Life had already imitated art, with an NYPD officer, Randy Jurgenson, going undercover in gay bars since he was similar in appearance to the victims of the bag killer. Intrigued by the leather subculture Bateson had told him about, Friedkin knew Matthew Ianniello, the mafioso who owned the Mineshaft and other Manhattan gay bars of the era, and was able to visit the bar himself. He later added scenes set there to his film, released in 1980 to mixed reviews after heavy protests by the city's gay community during production. Trial In pretrial motions, Bateson, through his attorney, attempted to have his confession suppressed. He argued that he had been drunk at the time, and the police had not yet read him his rights. Bateson also denied having made the phone call to Bell, claiming his purported confession was just based on what he had read about the case in the Voice. Bateson went on trial in early 1979. The state entered both his confession and Bell's Voice article into evidence against him. Contrary to his prediction of a long trial in the wake of his arrest, Bateson was convicted after four days, on March 5, 1979. At Bateson's sentencing a month later, prosecutor William Hoyt called him a \\"psychopath\\" and reiterated his belief that he was responsible for the six unsolved murders. While Hoyt admitted there was \\"no direct proof\\" of this, he said that Bateson had confessed to those crimes in a conversation with Richard Ryan, a friend who had testified for the state at the trial that Bateson had confessed the Verrill murder to him. Speaking for himself, Bateson denied any role in the other murders. Justice Morris Goldman sentenced Bateson to 20 years to life in prison, five years less than the minimum Hoyt had asked for. He ultimately found the connection to the other murders \\"too ephemeral\\" to merit any consideration in sentencing Bateson. In a 2018 Esquire article about Bateson, writer Matt Miller was unable to find what that evidence might have been as the New York County court clerk's office could not find a copy of the trial transcript. But nothing Miller had been able to review mentioned either the bags purportedly being traced to NYUMC or any mention of a deal offered to Bateson if he confessed to the other murders. Prison term and release Bateson ultimately served 24 years and 3 months of his sentence, becoming eligible for parole in 1997. On the day after his 63rd birthday, in August 2003, he was released from Arthur Kill Correctional Facility on Staten Island. According to online records kept by the state's Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, his parole was successfully completed in November 2008. That was the last public record of Bateson available ; where he is living, or even if he is alive, is not known. Miller attempted to contact Bateson for his Esquire article in 2018 at his last known address, in the Long Island village of Freeport, but was unsuccessful as the phone had been disconnected; emails to different addresses either bounced or were not answered. In his podcast interview around the same time, Friedkin said he had heard Bateson was living somewhere in upstate New York. A record in the Social Security Death Index shows that a Paul F. Bateson, with the same birthdate and a Social Security number issued in Pennsylvania, died on September 15, 2012. Media portrayals Bateson was portrayed by Morgan Kelly in the second season of the Netflix series Mindhunter.

In July, the remastered version, dubbed The Quest HD, was released for the iPad, and it was made available on the iPhone the following month. Redshift said they had been concerned that iPhone users might be confused because the HD version is incompatible with the expansions, which were never made available for the iPad. An Android version was released in October 2016. Several expansions were eventually ported to the remastered version. These function as standalone games if purchased separately; otherwise, existing characters may be imported.  Reception  Reviewing the 2009 iOS release, Slide to Play described it as \\"a great, story- rich game that requires some patience for its blocky screens and difficult controls\\". In 2010, the classic version was selected as one of IGN's top five iPhone RPGs. The same year, PC World included it in their top 5 role-playing games for the iPhone, recommending it to fans of early 1990s PC games. In 2014, Shaun Musgrave of Touch Arcade called this version \\"a true mobile classic\\" that \\"remains one of the best RPG experiences on a mobile device\\" despite its aging graphics. Damien McFerran of Pocket Gamer rated the classic version 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"If you consider yourself to be a fan of this genre, then this is one quest that is well worth undertaking.\\" Touch Arcade made The Quest HD its iOS game of the week. In their review, Musgrave rated it 5/5 stars and called it \\"an excellent remake\\". The Hungarian-language version of IGN rated the PC remaster 8.5/10.

She is the economic advisor to President Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's current president. Makhaya previously worked at Deloitte, Genesis Analytics and AngloGold Ashanti in South Africa. She then worked the Competition Commission of South Africa from 2010 to 2014. In 2015, Makhaya established Makhaya Advisory. Makhaya has several published papers, mainly focusing on competition economics and policy.  Education and work  Makhaya was born and raised in Hammanskraal, Gauteng, South Africa. In 1996, Makhaya enrolled in St Barnabas College, in Bosmont, South Africa. She later received a Rhodes Scholarship and went to St Antony's College of Oxford University as a part of the class of 2002, obtaining an MBA and MSc in developmental economics. Makhaya also went to the University of Witwatersrand and obtained a BCom in Economics and Law, an honors degree in economics and a Masters in Economics. During her employment at Deloitte, Genesis Analytics and AngloGold Ashanti, Makhaya worked in management consulting and also held corporate positions. In 2010, Makhaya joined the Competition Commission of South Africa, initially as a principal economist. She later held roles as a deputy commissioner and served as a member of the Competition Commission's executive committee. Her job at the Competition Commission was largely focused on competition economics and tasks included assessing competitive effects regarding business decisions as well as analyzing competition enforcement cases. Further tasks included representing the Competition Commission at the Competition Tribunal and serving as an expert witness. Makhaya was also a key figure in the imposing a fine of 1.46 billion rands on several construction companies involved in fraud to raise bids for stadiums for the 2010 FIFA World Cup during her time as deputy commissioner. In 2014, Makhaya left the Competition Commission. Makhaya established an advisory firm in 2015 called Makhaya Advisory and currently serves as its CEO.

Makhaya is tasked with organizing and delegating the work of the InvestSA Special Envoys who are to raise at least US$100 billion of international investments by 2023.  Selected publications  \\"Competition, barriers to entry and inclusive growth ‚Äì Capitec case study\\" (2015) Makhaya co-authored this working paper with Nicholas Nhundu. The paper used Capitec Bank, a retail bank in South Africa, as a case study to analyze barriers to entry in the South African retail banking industry. Capitec's success relative to other entrants into the industry in 2008 was examined to determine which factors contributed to Capitec's success and which barriers Capitec had to overcome to achieve success. The study found that Capitec's success led to competing banks to respond with implementations to compete with Capitec, as customers were choosing to switch to Capitec due to lower bank charges. Furthermore, customers of competing banks were offered lower costs to switch to Capitec. Convincing customers to switch saw Capitec overcoming a major barrier which was crucial to their success. The paper suggested that their use of a simple and understandable product and their persuading of lending clients to switch into being transactional banking clients, was a factor to their success. It was suggested in the paper that recommendations which arose from a market enquiry into banking also led to improved the competitive environment also contributed to Capitec's success. Despite the success of these methods, they concluded that the switching process could still be improved and among other improvements such as a stricter process to lead to adoption of innovation for future entrants. \\"Expectations and outcomes: considering competition and corporate power in South Africa under democracy\\" (2013) In this paper, Makhaya and co-author Simon Roberts analyzed changing corporate strategies and the competition law regime in South Africa. Case studies of three major industries were examined. They also analyzed the relationship between evolving corporate strategies and factors regarding market power protection and the effect of the competition authorities in South Africa's economy. As South Africa's economy had long been developed under apartheid, the authors argued that there was a limited understanding of a competitive market in South African industries. Furthermore, the authors suggested that South Africa's laws and institutions continued to favour powerful corporations, the expectations of the competition policy were misunderstood, and there was no role for the state, thus the role of the competition policy was undermined and ineffective. The study found that the effects of the policies established during the apartheid era continued to hinder industries in South Africa despite new democratic governments and economic reform because the framework allowed incumbent businesses to protect their own interests while hopeful entrants were restricted entry into the market, to no avail of competition authorities. As a result, existing firms sought investors who would protect their place in the market while new shareholders attempted to maintain the status quo to protect the rents. \\"How should young institutions approach competition enforcement? Reflections on South Africa's experience\\" (2012) Makhaya co-authored this paper in collaboration with Simon Roberts and Wendy Mkwananzi. It examined South Africa's execution of competition policy following the establishment of the competition regime. The paper used South Africa as an example of success regarding competition policy for the implementation of competition law throughout Africa and highlighted two strategic areas one being the importance of market outcome analysis and the other regarding settlement frameworks. The paper mentioned that implementing stricter enforcement laws enabled the commission to uncover extensive fraudulent behaviour in the economy. Major findings in the paper were the key reasons for the commission's success, one being the corporate leniency policy and the other being proactive investigations which have been effective in detecting cartel activity. The paper assessed the work of the South African Competition Commission since 1999, when it was created. They found that prioritizing initiation of investigations and incentivizing corporate leniency applications by corporations involved in fraudulent behavior were of significant important regarding the successful enforcement of cartels. This resulted in increased the credibility of the commission. These events led to successful cartel enforcement, one of the improvements in enforcement made by the Competition Commission. Another factor contributing to the Competition Commission's success found by the paper was the line of action taken regarding settlements with companies on good terms resulting in cooperating firms and favored competitive outcomes. They concluded that these factors contributed to Competition Commission's success as the competition authority of a developing country to handle the anti-competitive nature of existing South African businesses. \\"Telecommunications in developing countries: reflections from the South African experience\\" (2003) Written by Makhaya and Simon Roberts, this paper sought to examine debates surrounding privatization, international experience and economic development regarding South Africa's attempts to expand telecommunications service across the country while being in the process of privatizing telecommunications. The authors argued that despite the fact that advances in communication technologies in South Africa created opportunities for economic development there was also the risk of economic polarization that could result due to an uneven distribution of telecommunication services. Given the income inequalities in South Africa with respect to race, the authors suggested that these inequalities could be reflected with the extension of telecommunications services. However, the authors also provided evidence for the benefits to economic growth due to the expansion of telecommunications services. They analyzed South African's experience with the endeavor and examined the country's regulatory framework and privatization, the performance of one of its major networks, government interventions and regulations regarding telecommunications, and the effect telecommunications had on economic efficiency and universal service. One of the study's conclusions was that private ownership and regulation did not address the extension of affordable telecommunications services to the South African population in an attempt to abolish existing inequalities, which the authors deemed as the biggest issue faced by South Africans. As the network Telkom favored profit maximization, switching from exclusivity to expanding service became useless as profit maximization made telecommunication services less affordable to the people who would supposedly benefit from the extension. In turn, exclusivity was found to increase Telkom's profitability. Another conclusion was that Telkom was able to exploit its position in the industry because of competition issues being ignored during the process of privatization. This caused increased barriers to entry for new companies and undermined the effect of several factors on returns to the economy. The authors concluded that the South African experience suggested that a country's regulatory framework shaped the benefits received from reforming telecommunications services and that government intervention was required for the economy to benefit from the reform.  Other endeavors  Makhaya is an avid writer. Some of her recent fiction work has been published. She also contributes public commentary by writing columns for both Business Day and Acumen.

Present at the premiere were Dmitri Shostakovich and Dmitry Kabalevsky. The symphony is scored for an orchestra of: 3 flutes (third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (second doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, percussion, harpsichord, piano, and strings. The movements are as follows: #Allegro ma non troppo #Allegro vivace #Andante #Allegro The playing time is approximately 40 minutes. The compositional style has been likened to that of Nikolai Myaskovsky, who was the teacher of Schnittke's composition teacher Evgeny Golubev, and to that of Shostakovich, Paul Hindemith and Carl Orff.

He was a distinguished professor and founder of the Department of Engineering Mechanics at Northwestern Polytechnical University. He founded the Journal of Northwestern Polytechnical University and served as its chief editor for more than 60 years.  Early life and education  Hu was born on 19 June 1920 in Wuxi, Jiangsu, Republic of China. At age 16, he was admitted to St. John's University, Shanghai, and graduated four years later with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. He then went to the United States to study at the University of Michigan, where he earned his master's degree at age 21 and his Ph.D. in engineering mechanics at age 24.  Career  In 1944, Hu became a researcher at the Langley Research Center of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, the predecessor of NASA). He was promoted to senior engineer within three years, at the age of only 27. In 1948, Hu returned to China to teach at his alma mater, St. John's University. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the missionary St. John's University was closed in 1952 and Hu became a professor at the East China Aeronautics Institute. Four years later, East China Aeronautics Institute was relocated to Xi'an in Northwest China and then became part of the new Northwestern Polytechnical University. Hu moved to Xi'an and spent the rest of his career at the university, while his wife and daughter stayed in Wuxi. Together with Ji Wenmei (), Hu founded the engineering mechanics department at Northwestern Polytechnical University, and it was one of the first in China.

Katrina van Grouw is a British science author, illustrator, and fine artist, best known for her illustrated natural science books The Unfeathered Bird and Unnatural Selection published by Princeton University Press. She has degrees in Fine Art and Natural History Illustration. Van Grouw is a self-taught ornithologist with an interest in comparative anatomy, evolution, and the history of the natural sciences.  Early life and education  Katrina van Grouw was born in Pontypool, South Wales in 1965, adopted, and raised as Katrina Cook in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. (She became known by her current name after her marriage to Hein van Grouw, in 2009.) Van Grouw states that her prodigious drawing ability led to artistic hothousing during her school education which compromised her academic achievements. She gained a BA in Fine Art, specialising in printmaking, from the University of Plymouth (at that time Exeter College of Art and Design) in 1990, and an MA in Natural History Illustration from the Royal College of Art in 1992 with a research thesis on bird anatomy.  Fine art  In 1993 van Grouw moved to a cottage in rural Devon and began her career as a self-employed fine artist, specialising in large scale drypoints‚Äîa form of intaglio printmaking‚Äîof natural history subjects. She also taught adult education classes in drypoint, and lectured in printmaking and illustration to undergraduate students at the University of Plymouth, Chelsea College of Art and Design, and Falmouth College of Art and Design. She was an elected member of the Society of Wildlife Artists, held numerous open and solo exhibitions, and won several awards including the Birdwatch Artist of the Year Award in 1997 (black and white section) and 1998 (overall winner), the Wildlife Art Gallery Award in 1993 & 1996, and the PJC Drawing Award in 2014. From 1996 her subject matter and preferred medium changed to large graphite drawings of geological formations. Fine art was put aside during the final push to write and illustrate The Unfeathered Bird, and after its completion van Grouw found that producing illustrated books now ‚Äúticked all creative and intellectual boxes‚Äù.  History of natural history illustration  alt= During her education Katrina van Grouw developed a specialist interest in historical illustrated natural history publications and the printing techniques used to create them. John James Audubon's The Birds of America, Robert John Thornton's Temple of Flora, George Stubbs' The Anatomy of the Horse, and the printing by Alecto Historical Editions of Banks' Florilegium in the 1980s were particularly influential. Van Grouw has continued to write, consult, give talks and demonstrations, and national media broadcasts about historical natural history art. Projects have included selecting images and writing text for the British Library's Turning the Pages virtual book of Audubon's The Birds of America; appearing in Episode 1 of the BBC TV program The Secret of Drawing in 2005 hosted by Andrew Graham Dixon (again talking about The Birds of America); and demonstrating intaglio printing in a short film about Sydney Parkinson, the artist on James Cook's HMS Endeavour voyage, for the British Natural History Museum. She was a freelance consultant for the Natural History Museum's 2011 edition of The Birds of America and fact checker for Birds: The Art of Ornithology (and Great Birds of Britain and Europe) by Jonathan Elphick. Van Grouw regularly carries out identifications of birds depicted in historic Indian and Islamic paintings for Simon Ray and other London auction houses, and writes accompanying text for their sales catalogues. She has given frequent talks about printing techniques and their history in natural history publications at the Natural History Museum's libraries including the Rothschild Library at Tring and Rare Books Room at the NHM South Kensington, London. In 2007 van Grouw was commissioned by Quercus to author Birds an illustrated history of birds in art, choosing to focus on the biographies of the artists and the stories surrounding the creation and publication of their works. She also sourced the images and drew up the preliminary designs for the book.  Ornithology  Katrina van Grouw has been passionate about natural history and a keen birdwatcher throughout her life. She qualified as a bird ringer in the 1990s and took part in several long-term ringing expeditions in Africa, South America and the Shetland Islands, She was employed as resident bird ringer at Rutland Water Nature Reserve in 1998. Her interest in the preparation of museum specimens began as a young child. As an undergraduate student she taught herself to prepare bird study skins, and to clean and assemble skeletons. During this time she formulated her plans to produce The Unfeathered Bird, initially intended as an anatomy guide specifically for artists. Her preparation skills and knowledge of birds led to her employment as a curator of the ornithological research collections (Bird Group) at the British Natural History Museum in 2003, initially full-time and then in a job- share arrangement with her husband, the Dutch ornithologist and bird breeder Hein van Grouw. Van Grouw states that she was prohibited by a senior manager from undertaking spare time commercial writing or illustration projects, which led to her resignation in 2010 in order to pursue her long-term ambition to create The Unfeathered Bird, \\"leaving [her] utterly broken\\". Her husband remained at the museum in her place.  The Unfeathered Bird  The Unfeathered Bird was published in 2013 - twenty five years after its conception. Originally intended to be an anatomy resource for artists, van Grouw was determined that it should accessible to a wide audience with interdisciplinary interests, and spent years seeking a suitable publisher that would allow her vision to be brought to life. A double page spread from Unnatural Selection showing a domesticated pouter pigeon with its crop inflated in its courtship posture. According to the author's autobiographical public lecture A Very Fine Swan Indeed: Art, Science and 'The Unfeathered Bird', the musculature drawing was achieved by inserting a condom into the throat of the dead pigeon and blowing into it! According to the author's autobiographic account given in her public lecture, A Very Fine Swan Indeed: Art, Science, and 'The Unfeathered Bird', her successful relationship with Princeton University Press began in 2010 with a chance meeting with the publishers' Executive Editor Robert Kirk in a pub during the British Birdwatching Fair. One remarkable feature of the book is that it shows skeletons in animated postures as though they were alive and engaged in natural activities. The majority of the illustrations were drawn from skeletons that were cleaned and assembled by her husband at their home, leaving Katrina van Grouw free to concentrate on the illustrations and text. In the book's acknowledgments the author states, \\"no bird was harmed during the making of this book\\" before going on to give an exhaustive list of people who donated dead specimens which had died of natural causes, and of museum collections used. The Unfeathered Bird was received with worldwide critical acclaim from art and science communities alike. It's dedicated \\"To Amy\\" which was the name given to the Mallard skeleton van Grouw cleaned and assembled in 1987 and which sparked off the initial idea for The Unfeathered Bird, leading one reviewer to describe it as \\"undoubtedly the best ever book to be inspired by a dead duck.\\" A second and greatly expanded edition of The Unfeathered Bird is currently in production.  Unnatural Selection  The publication of Unnatural Selection in 2018 was timed to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, by Charles Darwin. In the book's acknowledgments the author states that it was produced to thank her husband, Hein van Grouw \\"a domesticated animal nerd\\", for his help preparing the skeletons for The Unfeathered Bird, combining his knowledge of selective breeding with her own interest in evolutionary biology. The dedication in the book reads, \\"To Husband, Naturally\\" and Hein van Grouw is referred to throughout the book simply as 'Husband'. It was published by Princeton University Press, once again, and the size and format is consistent with The Unfeathered Bird. In addition to the 80,000+ words of text, the book contains 425 illustrations by the author, who was also responsible for the design and layout of the entire book. It took six years to produce.

Much of the area is associated with erosional landforms such as foothills, mesas and gypsum plateaux. The village of Zekreet, the Zekreet Film City, and the headland of Ras Abrouq (which includes a nature reserve for wild deer) are all found on this stretch of land. The peninsula is part of the Al Reem Biosphere Reserve. Geography One of its defining features is the Bay of Zekreet, which is shaped like a half-moon. Geology An Arabian oryx in a rawda near Zekreet Film City The Abarug Member of the Eocene-period Dammam Formation is the dominant structural-lithic unit of the area. The uppermost part of the Abarug Member is formed of dull-colored slightly calcareous dolomitic limestone and is roughly 2 m thick, while the lower part is approximately 10 m thick and comprises brightly-colored slightly calcareous dolomitic marl. Wildlife Common ostriches, wild deer and gazelles occur in the peninsula. The Ministry of Municipality and Environment advises tourists not to visit during the ostrich breeding season due to their aggressive tendencies. Flamingos are commonly found near the Bay of Zekreet. The peninsula is a popular destination for foreign tourists due to its unspoiled beaches and limestone rock formations. Visitors frequently camp here overnight. However, some of the natural geography has suffered as a result of litter left behind, damage to the vegetation and damage to the land caused by tourists.

Her work included two books of poetry, Tigers at Awhitu (published jointly in England and New Zealand) and Gleam. After her early death from lung cancer, the Sarah Broom Poetry Prize, was established to remember and celebrate her life and work.  Biography  Sarah Kathryn Broom was born in 1972 in Dunedin. She grew up in Christchurch and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English and psychology from the University of Canterbury. She then completed an MA in English Literature at Leeds and DPhil at Oxford University, studying contemporary British and Irish poetry. She lectured at Somerville College, Oxford. In 1999, in Oxford, she married Michael Gleissner whom she had first met on a Lions Club scholarship to Japan. They returned to New Zealand in 2000. She took up a post-doctoral fellowship at Massey University in Albany and then lectured in English at the University of Otago. She and her family later lived in Glendowie, Auckland. Her poetry was published both in New Zealand, in journals such as Bravado, Landfall, Poetry New Zealand and Takahe, and in England in Acumen, Metre, Orbis and Oxford Magazine. She was diagnosed with stage-four lung cancer in February 2008, while pregnant with her third child. Her daughter was born safely at 30 weeks gestation soon after the diagnosis. Tigers at Awhitu which dwelt on themes of relationships, illness and motherhood was published simultaneously in England and New Zealand in 2010. The book was accepted on the strength of its first section, and the poems in the second section of the book were all written after her cancer diagnosis. She continued to write poetry throughout her treatment over the next few years, which involved participation in experimental drug trials in Australia. Sarah Broom was married and had three children. She died on 18 April 2013.  Awards and prizes  After her death, and at the posthumous launch of her poetry collection Gleam, the Sarah Broom Poetry Prize was announced. This prize was established by her husband and friends to celebrate poetry in New Zealand and to encourage and support the recipient to complete a manuscript of poems. The judging panel for the first award included Paula Green, Sarah Ross, Jennifer Crawford, Pat Palmer and Michael Gleissner. The guest judge, poet Sam Hunt, awarded the inaugural prize to winner C.K. Stead on 17 May 2014 at the Auckland Writers & Readers Festival.

Biography  Dominique Magnan was born at Reillanne, in Provence, on May 29, 1731. He studied at the University of Avignon, then joined the Minims of La Ciotat at age 20, where he began his career as a collector of ancient coins and medals. Appointed professor of theology in Marseille, he continued his work. He got in touch with the most famous antiquaries of the time, both in Italy and Germany, and speedily acquired an extensive reputation. According to the nineteenth-century biographers, he was invited by Francis I to attend the Imperial Medal Cabinet. But results of recent research provide no evidence that it does. Neither in the archives of the Hofburg nor in published studies on Vienna Collections. We don't known why he ended up in Rome instead of Vienna but he lived for nearly thirty years in the old convent of Trinity. True to a well-established tradition in the Minims, the Trinit√† dei Monti knew how to develop assets to participate in the Enlightenment debate. In the first place, a library. But they also did astronomy, botany, numismatics and published a lot. And Dominique Magnan was mainly the leader of this small group of religious. He had found here a good environment to undertake his scientific work. His first books received critical acclaim. But his most significant works were on numismatics, though heavily criticized by specialists of the time in that universal and complete coverage of the subject could maintain confusion between authentic coins and the fake ones. Having become treasurer of the convent, he had had to be accountable during the Apostolic Visit in 1794, which was fatal to him. Cardinal de Bernis directed that an inventory of his goods should be taken. About sixty in-folios in geography, numismatics, archeology were found, but also books of biblical scholarship, dictionaries and the Encyclop√©die. Asked to leave the Papal States in three days, he fled to Florence where he died in extreme misery in 1796.

The concept can be applied on the scale of an individual, a department, a company, or an entire industry. During the industrial revolution, disaggregation often entailed replacing tradesmen such as blacksmiths, carpenters, and weavers with steam-powered machines manned by unskilled laborers. Modern-day disaggregated labor market is organized via crowdsourcing internet websites or mobile apps maintained by for-profit firms acting as labor market intermediaries, like Amazon Mechanical Turk that offers work in a piecemeal fashion, or freelance services like TaskRabbit or Fiverr that offer gigs to freelance contractors. These services resemble the simplest models of labor markets, with the work relationships that became traditional during the last century being largely absent: no benefits, no medical insurance, no unions, no career concerns, and so on. Shared workspaces While many of the modern disaggregated jobs can be done remotely, some disaggregated workers prefer to have a semblance of an office. They are catered to by a new breed of services that provide shared workspaces and invite the workers to participate in a larger office culture, sheltering them from \\"a pervasive sense of alienation\\".

Development  AgustaWestland studies began in 2000 and in 2014 the European Union CleanSky 2 initiative contributed $328 million, including 60% for partners, then targeting a 2020 first flight. By 2017, the first flight target was shifted to 2023. The NGCTR wings are designed and produced by a consortium, that was selected in September 2017 and led by the Italian Aerospace Research Centre, including the University of Naples. Leonardo defined the structural requirements in 2018, with a preliminary design review released on 26 November and a critical design review in 2019, ahead of wing assembly in 2020 and first flight in 2023. In early 2019, Leonardo selected the General Electric CT7 to power the aircraft. The preliminary design review began in December 2018, to end by the first quarter of 2019, while the critical design review is planned for 2020. Prototype construction is planned for 2021‚Äì22. Performance tests are foreseen mid of 2019 at the DNW, the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels, and will be coordinated by the Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR).  Design  Aimed at the deepwater drilling energy market, the preliminary design concept was a pressurized aircraft with an MTOW seating 19‚Äì22 passengers, a top speed, a range of and a ceiling of . The initial requirements targeted direct operating costs that would be 30% below a conventional helicopter and recurring cost 50% below. The CleanSky 2 objectives for 2020 compared to 2000 were a 17% drag reduction, a 7% to 20% noise reduction, and a radius flown in 1h 45min, hover included. The 12m (39 ft) span wings will be made out of epoxy carbon fiber, giving it wingspan similar to the AW609, with the chord doubled to . It will employ two control surfaces per wing: flaperons for lift and control, and another lowered during vertical take offs.

He was born in Alc√°ntara (C√°ceres, Spain) around 1490. He was described as: \\"Of short and sturdy complexion. Broad. Thick skin. Clear mind and little doctrine. Clever, canny, fearless, and bit haughty\\".D√≠az del Castillo, Bernal (1963) [1632]. The Conquest of New Spain. Penguin Classics. J. M. Cohen (trans.) (6th printing (1973) ed.).

Conquest of M√©xico Captain De Grado was one of the few Spanish who dismembered with Cort√©s in Anahuac in 1519. Cort√©s \\"kept him by his side at all times, trusted his judgement and asked for his advice in difficult times\\". He took part in the foundation of Vera Cruz. He took part in the Battle of Cholula, where the Spanish fell into a trap of the Aztecs, and distinguished himself in the struggle by keeping a calm mind. He was one of the 30 Castilian soldiers that recommended Cort√©s to take a \\"preventive action\\" to keep this events from happening again. The 30 of them and Cort√©s entered the palace, captured Emperor Monktezuma, and took them to Cort√©s, where the Emperor lost his life. Alonso was there during the Noche Triste, and during the Great Battle of Otumba, where the Spanish managed to defeat a much larger force by leading them to an open field, a terrain that favoured them. In 1522 Alonso joined the expedition of Gonzalo de Sandoval to found the village of Esp√≠ritu Santo- so named because it was founded during the Pascua of Pentecost ‚Äì a settlement with commercial intent. He was among its first inhabitants.Hugh Thomas, \\"Conquest: Cortes, Montezuma, and the Fall of Old Mexico\\", Simon & Schuster, Rockefeller Center, 1993 In 1523 one of Cort√©s' captains, Crist√≥bal de Olid, betrayed Cort√©s by creating a personal alliance with Cuba's governor to conquer and split Honduras among themselves. Don Alonso took part in Olid's persecution, and once this chase was done and De Olid was in chains, he joined Luis Mar√≠n in the \\"conquest and unification\\" of Chiapas. As a reward for this he was promised the encomienda ‚Äì Spanish for \\"being in charge of\\" or \\"being the protector of\\" ‚Äì of half of the population or the region. However, he was accused of not respecting the laws of Burgos and mistreating his subjects. He was put under arrest and locked up by Cort√©s while an investigation on the charges was carried on. In 1525 he married the Aztec princess Isabel de Moctezuma. Shortly after, Cort√©s gave him the title of Visitador General of New Spain. He had the special duty of traveling the kingdom, \\"ensuring the good treatment of natives, and prosecuting illegal enslavement\\", under the Laws of Burgos. Alonso died while fulfilling this duty at some time prior to 1527.

Air crash  On 22 February 1944, the heavily damaged USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft Mi Amigo, from the 364th Bomber Squadron, based at Chelveston, Northamptonshire, was returning from a bombing mission over Aalborg, Denmark, during which it was heavily damaged by enemy fighter aircraft. Around 5 pm, engines faltering, it emerged out of low clouds and crashed in the park. The entire crew (pilot 1st Lt. John Kriegshauser, copilot 2nd Lt. Lyle Curtis, navigator 2nd Lt. John Humphrey, bombardier 2nd Lt. Melchor Hernandez, flight engineer/top turret gunner S/Sgt. Harry Estabrooks, radio operator S/Sgt. Bob Mayfield, ball turret gunner Sgt. Charles Tuttle, waist gunners T/Sgt. George Williams and Sgt. Vito Ambrosio, and tail gunner Sgt. Maurice Williams) perished. The pilot of Mi Amigo, John Kriegshauser, received a posthumous Distinguished Flying Cross for his courage in sacrificing the crew rather than hit children playing in the park. Among the children were Tony Foulds, then eight years old, and Keith Peters, aged nine, who was interviewed by Forces Broadcast Network (British Forces Broadcasting) for a 2015 documentary also broadcast on Sky TV. When viewed from Rustlings Road/Ecclesall Road the crash site can still be seen, marked by a noticeable drop in the height of the trees on the hillside behind the cafe. This was because a dozen trees were uprooted, or needed felling, due to the impact of the crash. Some remaining trees still bear scorch marks at their tops, noticeable when viewed in winter.  Memorial  A grove of ten scarlet oak trees (Quercus coccinea) was planted on 30 November 1969 as replacement trees to honour the crew, and on the same day a pair of memorial plaques attached to a large boulder were unveiled in a ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor of Sheffield, Alderman Daniel O'Neill; the Bishop of Sheffield, John Taylor, and Major General John Bell, Commander of the 3rd US Air Force in Britain.Access to the memorial site is via a path signposted 'Woodland Walk', or across the stepping stones next to the cafe. Since 2015, Tony Foulds has maintained the memorial, which for many years had been cared for by local military cadets, alongside the parks department. Mr Foulds' caretaking involves sweeping the path and watering the flowers in the Memorial Garden, which were all donated by garden centres and well-wishers. An interpretation board including a painting of Mi Amigo, by South Yorkshire artist Paul Rowland was placed near the memorial by Sheffield City Council in time for the 75th anniversary of the crash in 2019. A flagpole was also erected, having been donated following a crowdfunding drive by a local school by Boeing Europe, and the pupils of Birkdale School, Sheffield. An annual memorial service organised by the Sheffield branch of the Royal Air Forces Association is held at the site on the Sunday closest to 22 February.  Inscriptions  The upper of the two plaques reads (all in upper case): Erected by Sheffield R.A.F. Association in memory of the ten crew of U.S.A.A.F. bomber which crashed in this park 22-2-1944 The lower plaque lists the names of the ten crew members. Lt Kriegshauser (whose name is spelled wrong on the plaque) was pilot; Lt Lyle Curtis (co-pilot); Lt John Whicker Humphrey (navigator); Lt Melchor Hernandez (bomb-aimer); Sgt Robert Mayfield (radio operator/log-keeper/photographer); Sgt Harry Estabrooks (flight engineer/top-turret gunner); Sgt Charles Tuttle (lower turret gunner); Sgt Maurice Robbins (rear-gunner); Sgt Vito Ambrosio (waist-gunner and assistant radio operator) and Sgt George Malcolm Williams (waist-gunner and assistant flight engineer).  Flypast  In January 2019, BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker met Tony Foulds, by then a pensioner. This led to Walker publicising Fould's wish for a commemorative flypast over the memorial. On 22 February 2019, at 8:45 am, the United States Air Force (USAF) and Royal Air Force (RAF) carried out a fly-past to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the crash. The ten aircraft involved were, in order: * Dakota ZA947 of the RAF's Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (flying from RAF Coningsby) * MC-130J Commando II and CV-22 Osprey of the USAF's 352d Special Operations Wing (RAF Mildenhall) * KC-135 Stratotanker of the USAF's 100th Air Refueling Wing (RAF Mildenhall) * Two Typhoons of the RAF's 41 Squadron (RAF Coningsby) * Four F-15E Strike Eagles of USAF 48th Fighter Wing (RAF Lakenheath), flying in missing man formation The names of all ten of the Mi Amigo crew were painted onto the F-15Es. The F-15Es flew on to perform a second flypast at the American Cemetery and Memorial at Cambridge, where three of the crew are buried, the others having been repatriated. Thousands of members of the public watched the flypast from the park, alongside relatives of the deceased air crew. BBC Breakfast was broadcast live from the event with Foulds as a featured guest, although Walker was unable to attend being in Tanzania, from where he watched the event online.

Her novel Enlightenment for Idiots was named by Booklist as one of the top ten novels of 2008. Life Cushman is closely involved with the Mindfulness meditation program at Spirit Rock Meditation Center. Cushman obtained her bachelor's degree in comparative religion at Princeton University in 1984. She completed Spirit Rock Meditation Center's 2-year \\"Community Dharma Leader\\" and its 4-year \\"Dharma Retreat Teacher\\" training courses. She directs the mentoring element of the Mindfulness meditation teacher certification program at Spirit Rock, where in 2007 she and dharma instructor Phillip Moffitt founded the first multi-year Buddhist meditation training for yoga teachers. She has taught around a hundred yoga and meditation retreats and trainings. She notes in her book Moving into Meditation that \\"the fusion of yoga asana and Buddhist meditation‚Äîonce viewed as heretical in both camps‚Äîhas [by 2014] become common.\\" She adds that \\"Mindful yoga\\" is not \\"just a random combination of techniques cooked up by marketing professionals\\", but that mindfulness meditation and the asanas of hatha yoga are \\"different strands of the same braided rope of yogic history and philosophy\\" developed in India over the past 2,500 years. Cushman was for 8 years an editor of Yoga Journal; she has also been also West Coast editor of Tricycle: The Buddhist Review. She has written articles for both journals, and for others including Yoga International. She has given numerous talks on topics related to meditation, for example on dharma (right living). She has led workshops at the Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health. See also https://kripalu.org/search/cushman She presents \\"embodied mindfulness\\" retreats for women. As a writer and a teacher of yoga and Buddhist meditation, she stated in an interview with Integral Yoga magazine that to her, both yoga and writing are full-time \\"mastery paths\\". She married a classmate from Princeton in 1999, divorcing in 2002. She lives with her son in Fairfax, California. She travelled to India in 2007 on a \\"pilgrimage\\" to visit places associated with the Buddha; the trip provided material for her 2009 novel Enlightenment for Idiots. Reception Mata Amritanandamayi, thought by reviewers to be one of the figures satirised in Enlightenment for Idiots Enlightenment for Idiots Hillary Dowdle, reviewing Enlightenment for Idiots in Yoga Journal, noted that chick lit was hardly the usual genre for insight into yoga philosophy. But in Dowdle's opinion, the book succeeds on both counts, being enjoyably entertaining and \\"capturing the ashrams and gurus that attract Western spiritual seekers.\\" A character called Mr. Kapoor whom she compares to B. K. S. Iyengar is enthused about by his students: \\"He'll crucify you over a metal folding chair\\"; she recognises characters Prana Ma, resembling the hugging guru Mata Amritanandamayi (widely known as Amma), and Saraswati, resembling Gangaji, who demands that her students understand that \\"Self and Other are merely constructs to be transcended\\". Such characters, Dowdle notes, are \\"ripe for a little satire\\", but between the lines of the \\"fun romp\\" is genuine wisdom. Publishers Weekly called the book \\"a hilarious take on the quest for truth that manages to respect the journey while skewering many of the travelers.\\" Anna Douglas, on Inquiring Mind, described it as \\"a winning combination of romance, satire and spiritual adventure. In particular, it speaks to the paradoxical issues that women often face when they immerse themselves in Asian spiritual traditions.\\" Moving into Meditation Lisa Francesca, in Yoga Teacher magazine, wrote that Moving into Meditation: A 12-Week Mindfulness Program for Yoga Practitioners, combines Cushman's experience in Mindful Yoga and teachings with practical resources in the form of names of yoga and meditation teachers \\"and their books\\", along with \\"short wisdom stories from contemporary yogis and meditators\\" and audio and video materials on her website, enabling the reviewer to work through the exercises (combining asana practice, pranayama, and meditation) at her own pace.

In the same season, Western Suburbs went from wooden spooners in 1933 to winning the minor premiership and premiership in 1934. The change in form was attributed to the fact that Western Suburbs lost players such as Frank McMillan and Alan Ridley who were away on tour with the Australian team when the club finished last but returned for the start of the 1934 season.

Background Montenegro has experienced less religious conflict than the other former Yugoslavian states, and has historically had a high degree of religious tolerance and diversity. There is, however, an outstanding dispute between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, as both churches lay claim to the country's many Orthodox religious sites and dispute each other's legitimacy.

United States reactions In the annual International Religious Freedom Report, the State Department wrote that the Serbian Orthodox Church strongly criticized the law, which stipulates religious property lacking clear ownership and that, after the passing of the religion law, they organized regular peaceful protests in which hundreds of thousands turned out. The report said that the Montenegrin government continued its policy of not providing restitution of religious properties expropriated by the former Yugoslav communist government, as well as that contrary to the announcements, this law did not address the restitution issues. Furthermore, the State Department described the protests as generally peaceful except for isolated incidents of violence against the police, accompanied by online incitements to violence. The report mentioned that the government and analysts said there was an apparently coordinated campaign of disinformation, propaganda, and provocation, ‚Äúseeking to fan ethnonationalistic divisions and provoke conflict through the protests‚Äù.

Prior to the founding of the Second Republic, women had few rights and were often under the control of their fathers or husbands. Their role in the state was to be a good mother, and the framework of the state supported that. They had few employment opportunities, were largely illiterate and their children often died during childbirth. Political activism was often based around Catholic organized women's groups. The Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera saw women enlisted on electoral rolls for the first time, as well as being allowed to run for municipal political office and appointed to the national congress by 1927. The birth of the Second Republic in 1931 saw the rights of women expand, including the granting of the right to vote. Many on the left opposed this, believing women would support right-wing candidates as they remained under the influence of the Catholic Church and their husbands. The period of the Second Republic also saw the creation of Secci√≥n Femenina de la Falange Espa√±ola, the only important Nationalist political organization for women in this period. The Spanish Civil War started in July 1936. The treatment of women and children behind the lines was used by all sides as a way of trying to garner support for their sides in the Civil War both internally and internationally. Internally, Nationalist forces often had few problems killing women or using them as shields to try to attack Republican forces. Falangist women activists at times had difficulty in deciding whether they should to be in the public eye serving the cause or stay working in the home to serve Nationalist interests away from the front. Catholic women activists faced similar conflicts. The issue was mirrored in broader Nationalist society, which faced the need for women to fill support roles to help the war effort, while at the same time wanting women to remain pure, supporting traditional motherhood and working in the home. The concept of motherhood would also change fundamentally during the war, with mothers becoming the one in charge of the home. This idea would carry over into post- Francoist motherhood. The end of the Civil War, and the victory of fascist forces, saw the return of traditional gender roles. This meant a return to gender norms of the past, except where economic needs required the presence of women in the workforce. Secci√≥n Femenina shaped the definition of Francoist womanhood, in state-sponsored Christian feminism. Nationalist women won benefits through motherhood, while women who supported Republicanism in this period often had their children stolen from them. Limited amounts of feminist beliefs were sanctioned by Francoist Spain, with much of the independently published material coming from aristocratic women.  Background (1800‚Äì1922)   Women's rights  Spanish women did not hold the same status as citizens as men from 1800 to 1931. Single Spanish women enjoyed a few more legal rights than their married peers once they reached the age of 23. At that point, unmarried women could sign contracts and run businesses on their own behalf. Married women needed the approval or involvement of their husbands to handle matters such as changing their address, accepting an inheritance, or owning property or a business. All women in this period were denied the right to vote or run for political office. While it was legal for men to commit adultery so long as it was not \\"scandalous\\", all forms of adultery were illegal for women and they could be imprisoned for two to six years for the offense. Divorce was also banned. Catholicism played a huge role in Spanish political thinking in the nineteenth and early twentieth century Spain. The religion supported strict gender roles, which led to the repression of Spanish women and fostered ingrained sexism across the whole of Spanish society. Society, through the Catholic Church, dictated that the role of women was to marry, and bear children. They were to be invisible in society outside the domestic sphere. Violations of these norms was often met with violence. Families could force women into marriage against their will. Husbands could put their wives into prison for disobeying them or insulting them.  Political activity  The year 1919 marked the first time that attempts were made to mobilize conservative women in Spain, with the Acci√≥n Cat√≥lica de la Mujer (ACM). Following its creation, women were involved in efforts to defy the government when it came to laws that challenged the supremacy of Catholicism in Spain.  Employment and labor organizations  While 17% of women worked in 1877, most were peasants who were involved in agriculture. Despite industrialization in Spain and because of the industrialization of agriculture in the 1900s, restrictive gender norms meant only 9% of women were employed by 1930. This represented a drop of 12% of all women and 0.5 million total women in the workforce from 1877 to 1930. Prostitution was legal in pre-Second Republic Spain, and poor, white women had to fear being trafficked as slaved. By the 1900s, women could and did sometimes work in factory sweatshops, alongside young male workers. Most women seeking employment outside their own homes worked in the homes of the more affluent in the country. These jobs paid so little that female workers often struggled to earn enough to feed themselves. When women were involved in factory work in this period, they were often paid half the wage of their male counterparts. Despite the limited opportunities for women, some did manage to get highly ranked government positions, though these were few and far between.  Education  The cultural situation in Spain resulted in a largely uneducated female population, with the literary rate for women only at 10% in 1900. The number of women known to have university titles in the period between 1800 and 1910 was around one, with Mar√≠a Goyri being the exception among Spanish women. When education was offered to women, it was with the goal of improving their performance in their domestic roles. This began to slowly change, with the literacy rate for women being 62% by 1930 and the gender ratio in schools being close to 50/50 on the primary school level. This did not carry over to universities, where only 4.2% of students were women in 1928.  Childbirth  Infant mortality rates were very high in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and many children in Spain were born out of wedlock.  Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930)   Employment and labor organizations  40% of all Spanish working women in 1930 worked in domestic roles, representing the largest single industry for which women were present. Despite Primo de Rivera's view about the role of women, women were still able at times to have high ranking places in Spanish bureaucracy.  Political activity and government participation  Spain's right was divided into several factions, including Alfonsine monarchists, Carlists and Falangists. It also included political parties like Confederaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Derechas Aut√≥nomas (CEDA), Partido Republicano Radical (PRR), Derecha Liberal Republicana (DLR) and Lliga Catalana (LC). None of these had notable women's branches. Most of the political activity from right leaning women came from Catholic women's groups, which public activity around unnerved conservative institutions because of problem of duality of these women seeking to protect the role of conservative women in the home while being highly visible in activist roles outside of it. In 1928, ACM membership was at its peak with 119,000 thousand women members. The 8 March 1924 Royal Decree's Municipal Statue Article 51 for the first time included an appendix which would allow electoral authorities on a municipal level to list women over the age of 23 who were not controlled by male guardians or the state to be counted. Article 84.3 said women could vote in municipal elections assuming they were the head of household, over the age of 23, and their state did not change. Changes were made the following month that allowed women who met those some qualifications to run for political office. Consequently, some women took advantage of this political opening, ran for office and won some seats in municipal governments as councilors and mayors. Women would gain access to national representation during the 1927 - 1929 legislative period as a result of the Royal Decree Law of 12 September 1927, Article 15. This law stated, \\"to it may belong, indistinctly, males and females, single, widowed or married, these duly authorized by their husbands and as long as they do not belong to the Assembly [...]. Its designation will be made nominally and of Royal order of the Presidency, agreed in the Council of Ministers before October 6 next.\\" The 1927 - 1929 session also began the process of drafting a new Spanish constitution that would have fully franchised women voters in Article 55. The article was not approved. Despite this, women were eligible to serve in the national assembly in the Congreso de los Diputados, and fifteen women were appointed to seats on 10 October 1927. Thirteen were members part of the National Life Activities Representatives (). Another two were State Representatives (). These women included Mar√≠a de Maeztu, Micaela D√≠az Rabaneda and Concepci√≥n Loring Heredia. During the Congreso de los Diputados's inaugural session in 1927, the President of the Assembly specifically welcomed the new women, claiming the exclusion of them had been unjust. Loring Heredia would interrupt and demand an explanation from the Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts on 23 November 1927, marking the first time a woman had done this on the floor of Congress.  Daily life for women  In the days of the pre-Republic period and dictatorship, women on the streets of major cities like Barcelona and Madrid were often subjected to street harassment.  Second Spanish Republic (1931 - 1937)   Elections in the Second Republic  \\"Rep√∫blica Espa√±ola\\" (1931) by painter Teodoro Andreu. The Second Republic had three elections. They were held in 1931, 1933 and 1936.  1931 elections  The first women to win seats in Spain's Cortes were Clara Campoamor Rodr√≠guez, Victoria Kent Siano and Margarita Nelken y Mansbergen following the June 1931 elections, when women still did not have the right to vote. Campoamor, a centrist viewed by some of her colleagues as right leaning, had created the Female Republican Union during the early part of the Second Republic. Female Republican Union had the sole purpose of advocating for women's suffrage, and did not support adding more rights beyond that. Campoamor and Kent had both been waged highly public battles during the writing of the constitution of the Second Republic over the rights of women, and over the issue of universal suffrage. This battle would largely continue during the first term of Spain's Congreso de los Diputados. Campoamor, in arguing for women's suffrage before the Cortes on 1 October 1931, that women were not being given the right to vote as a prize, but as a reward for fighting for the Republic. Women protested the war in Morocco. Women in Zaragoza protested the war in Cuba. Women went in larger numbers to protest the closer of Ateneo de Madrid by the government of Primo de Rivera. Kent, in contrast, received much more support from Spain's right, including Catholics and traditionalists, during this period of constitutional debate as she, alongside Nelken, opposed women's suffrage. Kent believed women would vote as their husbands and the Roman Catholic Church dictated, and that women, with a 90% illiteracy rate, would not be able to make informed voting decisions on their own. Kent and Campoamor became involved in a grand debate over the issue, receiving large amounts of press related to their arguments.  1933 Elections  Men and women wait at Escuela Biteri in Hernani to vote in the 1933 elections. The 1933 elections were the first which women could vote in national elections. The conservatives came out ahead in the elections of 1933. The left blamed their victory on women, and their voting practices in that election. The left viewed women's votes as being controlled by the Church. The elections also saw conservative male leaders try to change the goals of the ACM. Rather than having the ACM try to accomplish political goals, they sought to direct participants to be more engaged in charity work and supporting working-class families. Campoamor and Kent both lost their seats in these elections.  February 1936 elections  Campoamor found herself locked out of the political process for the 1936 elections, as she had criticized her Radical Party for not supporting women's issues and removed herself from their list. Serving as President of Organizaci√≥n Pro-Infancia Obrera, she tried to find another political party that would allow her on their list while also advocating for women's rights. Failing to do so, she tried and failed to create her own political party. During the elections, pamphlets were distributed in Seville that warned women that a leftist Republican victory would result in the government removing their children from their homes and the destruction of their families. Other pamphlets distributed by the right in the election warned that the left would turn businesses over to the common ownership of women.  Education  The Second Republic had a goal of educating women. This was viewed as a radical concept, and many reactionaries inside the Republic were opposed to it. Many others supported it, seeing education as a tool to allow women to pass along Republican values to their children.  Women's rights  A postage stamp by issued by Correos during the Second Republic honoring women in the 1931 Cortes Constituyentes. Universal suffrage was finally achieved in December 1931. Legal equality for women was opposed by many on Spain's right. They saw it as a degeneration of Spain, which would result in the destruction of the Spanish family. This tension about the rights of women was part of their tension over the existence of the Republic, and one of the reason they were opposed to it.  Political activity   Catholics  Women involved in Acci√≥n Cat√≥lica de la Mujer (ACM) were involved in challenges to the Second Republic's laws that prohibited Catholic ceremonies and civic activities, including religious processions through towns. They often defied these laws, and were at the front of processionals in order to insure they were allowed to practice their more conservative version of Catholicism. Mothers also continued to enroll their children in and support Catholic education in spite of government attempts to limit it. Despite these political activities, male leadership in the Catholic Church and broader right leaning society attempted to get the ACM to be less political during the Second Republic. They encouraged ACM leadership to focus more on doing charity work, and on assisting working-class families. To this end, conservative leaders successfully oversaw the merger of ACM with the Uni√≥n de Damada del Sagrado Coraz√≥n in 1934. The new organization was called the Confederaci√≥n de Mujeres Cat√≥lics de Espana (CMCE). As a successful consequence, membership numbers dropped from 118,000 in 1928 to 61,354 members. It also saw the resignation of the more politically active women leaders from the newly formed CMCE. The newly merged organization also encouraged women explicitly to be less political, and participate in at most one or two demonstrations a year. Young conservative Catholic women defied their leaders, and sought to be politically active and visible in their goals. Sensing the political tides, these women started leaving ACM by 1932 and joined Juventud Cat√≥lica Femenina in large numbers. From 9,000 members in 1928, the organization grew to 70,0000 by 1936, with the bulk of the increase happening between 1932 and 1935. These young Catholic women took the opportunity to gain public attention in ways that were not connected to their sexuality or charitable works. Many among them welcomed the potential enfranchisement the Second Republic was offering.  Falangists  = Secci√≥n Femenina de la Falange Espa√±ola = The comrades of Secci√≥n Femenina de Falange de Santa Marta. Photo by In√©s Cabellero de Le√≥n. 1936. Secci√≥n Femenina de la Falange Espa√±ola was founded in 1934. It was led by Pilar Primo de Rivera, sister of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, as an women's auxiliary organization of Falange. Fascist in the mold of Mussolini's Italian party, both organizations were misogynistic in their approach to the goals of building a revolutionary organic society that would support traditional Spanish values. There were three things they saw as critical to doing this: the family, the municipality and the syndicate. Using traditional gender roles from the Catholic Church, they would impose their values on women in the home. Given its goals of making women docile participants in civic life, the women's organization does not meet the definition of a feminist organization. It was the only major Nationalist women's political organization, with a membership of 300 in 1934. By 1939, Secci√≥n Femenina would eclipse the male run party in memberships, with over half a million women belonging to the group.  Start of the Civil War  Location of Melilla, where Nationalist forces started their campaign in 1936. On 17 July 1936, the Uni√≥n Militar Espa√±ola launched a coup d'√©tat in North Africa and Spain. They believed they would have an easy victory. They failed to predict the people's attachment to the Second Republic. With the Republic largely maintaining control over its Navy, Franco and others in the military successfully convinced Adolf Hitler to provide transport for Spanish troops from North Africa to the Iberian peninsula. These actions led to a divided Spain, and the protracted events of the Spanish Civil War. Franco's initial coalition included monarchists, conservative Republicans, Falange Espa√±ola members, Carlist traditionalist, Roman Catholic clergy and the Spanish army. They had support from fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The Republican side included Socialists, Communists, and various other left wing actors.  Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939)  The Spanish Civil War started in July 1936, and women across became involved in support roles like nurses or running charitable organizations, or serving nationalist interests by tending to their families behind the front.  Role in family  Mothers had a variety of different experiences during the Civil War depending on their personal situations. Many mothers in rural areas were apolitical, no matter what side of the front they lived on. They had little access to resources that would have allowed them to be politically engaged, and were often short on resources required for basic living. For many mothers in rural areas, the idea of being politically engaged was not possible. They had too many things they had to do at home to have time for that. They had to make soap. They had to work in the fields because of national rationing. Most Spanish homes during the war lacked running water at home. Mothers had to acquire water from local wells, lakes or rivers. They had to wash clothing for the whole family, making a journey to a body of water to do that. They also had to be home to prepare food when it was available. Most homes at this time did not have modern kitchens, and mothers had to cook over open flames using hay and wood for heat. During the war, mothers worked hard to try to maintain a sense of normalcy. This included continuing domestic education, both among Republican and Nationalist women. Topics of focus included understanding the water, agriculture and religious education. Spanish sayings used by mothers at this time included, \\"After you eat, do not read a single letter.\\" Reading was not viewed as good for digestion. Children were also encouraged by their mothers in rural areas to take a siesta after a meal. Corporal punishment was often the norm for many mothers of all political persuasions during this period. Many mothers went to great lengths to try to feed their children during periods of food shortages. They might sneak into other towns to try to get food rations when the ration in their town was too small. They might forgo eating themselves so their children could have bigger portions. The war upset the social structure inside the family. Because of survival issues related to food and fear of political persecution, the skills of mother in acquiring and preparing food while also remaining politically invisible meant they began to take on the role of head of household. Silence became a virtue, because doing or saying the wrong thing could lead to death at the hands of Nationalist forces. Women were less likely to be harassed than men, which meant they were often more out of the home. This could create tensions behind closed doors, as it attacked traditional Spanish definitions of masculinity as it made the home the domain of the mother. This change of women being the boss of the home would continue after the Civil War for both Republican and Nationalist families.  Civilian women on the home front  Many poor, illiterate and unemployed women often found themselves immersed in the ideological battle of the Civil War and its connected violence as a result of forces beyond her control. Some of these women, mostly on the left, chose to try to reassert control by becoming active participants in the violent struggle going on around them. When it came to deciding who was right and wrong, many women had to use their own moral judgement formed by a lifetime to do so. They were not guided by political radicalization leading to ideological based morality. Women and children behind the lines were used by all sides, as a way of trying to garner support for their sides in the Civil War both internally and internationally. Nationalists often appealed to Catholics overseas, condemning Republican bombings on women in civil populations, claiming over 300,000 women and children had been killed. This met with limited success in the United States, where Catholics were uneasy with bombings against women and children that were being committed by both sides. In the Republican offensive against Nationalist held Teruel from December 1937 to February 1938, brigades on the ground tried to honor Indalecio Prieto's call to protect civilians, and particularly women and children. They sometimes stopped shelling buildings when people inside made clear they were non-combatant women and children. The reality of the offensive and life on the front lines meant many of those civilians had nothing. Women would often risk their lives to loot recently shelled buildings. They needed furniture to burn to melt snow for water, to cook and to provide some heat. Many women, on both sides in the city, died of starvation during the month long battle. One tactic employed by Nationalist troops was to use women to try to lure out Republican forces from concealed positions. They would use women's voices or got women to say they were civilians under siege. As a consequence, some Republican troops were hesitant when confronting women under apparent siege on the front as they did not always trust claims of needs for assistance.  Nationalist women on the Nationalist homefront  Caricature of Gracia y Justicia, conservative magazine of political humor published in Spain during the Second Republic. It shows a woman with her boyfriend, both humble, planning her marriage to a wealthy man (Don Gregorio) only to get his fortune after the divorce. The vignette is part of the campaign organized by Catholic right media and parties in order to avoid the legalization of divorce. In the text that accompanies the cartoon reads: \\"I thought that first I will marry Don Gregorio, and with the money that I will take from him in the divorce, I will marry you and live happily.\\" Falangist women activists were often divided into groups, which were largely based on age. Younger activists often to be outside the home, working on Nationalist goals in Nationalist women's organizations. Older women Nationalist activists believed they should be outside the public eye, serving Nationalist interests by working in the home. Nationalist women in more rural, less cosmopolitan cities, often had more privileges than their urban counterparts. They were able to leave the house, regardless of their marital status, and engage in the everyday tasks required for living. Few people noticed and cared. While Nationalist forces believed women should be at home, the realities of war meant that women were required to work outside the home, in factories and other businesses. During the war, Nationalist publications encouraged women to stay at home in service of the family. They were discouraged from shopping, going to the movies and engaging in other behavior viewed as frivolous by Nationalist male leaders. Nationalist supporting women behind Nationalist lines also sometimes were involved in auxiliary roles. This included working as nurses, provisioners and support personnel. They were encouraged to do so by men as a means of supporting the traditional Spanish family structure. Many Spanish women during the war sided with the Nationalists, embracing the strict gender roles put forth by the Catholic Church. The sister of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera worked to mobilize these women in Secci√≥n Femenina, an umbrella organization of Falange, during the pre-Civil War period and later during the war. From 300 members in 1934, its membership swelled to 400,000 in 1938. Women involved with the organization often went on to work for Auxilio Social, which acted as a social assistance organization for widows, orphans and the destitute by providing them with food and clothing. In all these roles, Spanish Nationalist women never did so with the intention of challenging male authority; they wanted to see the continuance of Republican gender roles and to strengthen the Spanish family. Starting in October 1937, Secci√≥n Femenina de la Falange Espa√±ola started actively recruiting single women between the ages of 17 and 35 to do social work as a volunteer for six months. In some cases, service was mandatory. It represented the first mass mobilization of women by Nationalist forces. Auxilio Social became the largest Nationalist social aid organization during the civil war. It was modeled after Nazi Germany's Winter Aid program. Staffed by women wearing blue uniforms with white aprons, they worked in taking care of children and other displaced people, and in distributing aid. The purpose of women in this organization was to serve others in maintaining traditional Spanish families within a patriarchal state. Nationalist women had another organization for which they could volunteer. It was the Margaritas, and came from traditionalist Carlist philosophies. Their purpose was to support Spanish families, with a husband in charge of a pious and religious wife and obedient children. Pilar Jaraiz Franco, the niece of Francisco Frano, sympathized with her uncle's politics and, during the Civil War, spent some time in a Republican prison. Despite this, she gradually moved towards more socialist leanings as a result of the rigid gender norms forced on her during her childhood. Salamanca and Burgos became home to large numbers of women who were wives of military officers on the Nationalist side. They could largely live comfortable, as their part of Spain was not in a state of total war. Both cities had zones for homes, and military zones. The military zones were home to medical services and to prostitutes. Nationalist nurses working in these zones were viewed as essential but transgressive, as they were occupying male spaces. As such, their behavior was always highly watched. Poverty and economic need often pushed many women into prostitution, where it flourished behind Nationalist lines. That Nationalist forces were fighting for a Spain that supported traditional family structures and opposed to prostitution did nothing to stop Nationalist officers from using prostitutes. Despite nationalist ideals about the role of women, the Nationalist attracted single women from abroad to their cause. These women, by their mere existence, transgressed Nationalist teachings about women as they were traveling alone, accompanied by male guardians, and acting on their own behalves. Many were literate and well traveled. Many came from European aristocratic and were upper class. Full of self-confidence, they made Nationalists uncomfortable, especially in contrast to the typically poor, illiterate Spanish woman who had not traveled. Their advocacy on behalf of Franco was viewed by many as counter-productive as it suggested women could find success outside the home, when Francoists and Nationalists believed women belonged in the home. Nationalist forces did attract foreign women writers and photographers to their cause. These included Helen Nicholson, the Baroness de Zglinitzki, Jane Anderson, Pip Scott-Ellis, and Florence Farmborough. These women were all advocates of right wing-ideology, and militantly opposed to Communism. They came from a wide variety of right wing ideologies, including monarchists and fascism.  Nationalist women behind Republican lines  Many Nationalist sympathizing women were killed behind Republican lines. Around 8,000 priests and nuns were tortured or murdered behind Republican lines. These deaths were part of the over 89,000 executions historians believed were conducted by Republican forces in the lead up to and during the Spanish Civil War.  Francoist Spain (1938 - 1973)   Gender roles  The end of the Civil War, and the victory of fascist forces, saw the return of traditional gender roles to Spain. This included the unacceptability of women serving in combat roles in the military. Where gender roles were more flexible, it was often around employment issues where women felt an economic necessity to make their voices heard. It was also more acceptable for women to work outside the home, though the options were still limited to roles defined as more traditionally female. This included working as nurses, or in soup kitchens or orphanages. With strict gender norms back in place, women who had found acceptable employment prior and during the Civil War found employment opportunities even more difficult in the post war period. Teachers who had worked for Republican schools often could not find employment. Gender norms were further reinforced by Secci√≥n Femenina de la Falange Espa√±ola. Opportunities to work, study or travel required taking classes on cooking, sewing, childcare and the role of women before they were granted. If women did not take or pass these classes, they were denied these opportunities.  Motherhood  While motherhood was an important ideal during the Franco period, it was one the regime only wanted to see perpetuated among those who shared in their political ideology. Children of mothers with leftist or Republican leanings were often removed from their care in order to prevent mothers from sharing their ideology with their offspring.  Feminism  Isabel the Catholic in Alcala de Henares. Secci√≥n Femenina de la Falange Espa√±ola worked to depict feminism as a form of depravity. It associated feminism with drug abuse and other evils plaguing society. While not meeting the classical definition of a feminist organization, the state supported its own desired goals for female expression, expressed through Secci√≥n Femenina, offered Isabel the Catholic and Teresa of Avila as symbols for Spanish women to look up. They had first been used by Francoist women during the Civil War, and reminded women that their role was to become mothers and to engage in pious domesticity. Secci√≥n Femenina did things like creating agricultural and adult schools, sports centers and libraries. They organized cultural groups and discussion groups. They published their own magazine. They worked to preserve traditional rural life. All of this was done with the underlying goal of encouraging traditional womanhood, of remaining in the home as a good daughter, and later as a good wife and mother. The pride that women got in completing these domestic tasks associated with Secci√≥n Femenina's teachings has been described by Guiliana Di Febo as Christian feminism. Some feminists in Franco's Spain tried to subvert government goals and change policy by becoming directly involved in government institutions. The Castilian Association of Homemakers and Consumers was one organization that attracted the type of feminist that believed that change should come from within. They became regime accepted vehicles for female dissent.  Women's rights  The pillars for a New Spain in the Franco era became national syndicalism and national Catholicism. The Franco period saw an extreme regression in the rights of women. The situation for women was more regressive than that of women in Nazi Germany under Hitler. The legal status for women in many cases reverted to that stipulated in the Napoleonic Code that had first been installed in Spanish law in 1889. The post Civil War period saw the return of laws that effectively made wards of women. They were dependent on husbands, fathers and brothers to work outside the house. Women needed permission to do an array of basic activities, including applying for a job, opening a bank account or going on a trip. The law during the Franco period allowed husbands to killed their wives if they caught them in the act of adultery. In March 1938, Franco suppressed the laws regarding civil matrimony and divorce that had been enacted by the Second Republic. It was not until later labor shortages that laws around employment opportunities for women changed. These laws passed in 1958 and 1961 provided a very narrow opportunity, but an opportunity, for women to be engaged in non-domestic labor outside the household. Franco's policies towards women also resulted in Spain having one of the highest rates of illiteracy for women in the western world.  Women's media and writing  Inside Spain, well connected, often aristocratic Spanish feminists were sometimes able to publish their works for domestic consumption by 1948. This includes works by Mar√≠a Lafitte, Countess of Campo Alanaga, and Lil√≠ √Ålvarez. Works by Republican pre-war feminists like Rosa Chacel and Mar√≠a Zambrano, who continued to write from exile, also saw their works smuggled into Spain.

Opened by Bernard's father in 1946, the bar was popular with motor racing personalities and hydrographers. It closed due to redevelopment in 1996. History The bar was located near the Beau Rivage corner on the Circuit de Monaco. It was opened by Bernard's father in 1946 and named for the Chatham Dockyard of the British Royal Navy to appeal to the many British Naval personnel who visited the port or Monaco. The bar was decorated with photographs, newspaper clippings, and memorabilia associated with motor racing. The official Formula One 'opus' book described the bar as \\"Not the biggest, certainly not the most luxurious nor even the best of the Principality's many watering holes ... It was one of the temples of grand prix racing\\". The bar was popular with motor racing personalities and hydrographers. In his autobiography, Graham, Graham Hill wrote that he always called at Rosie's for \\"a quick beer\\" before leaving Monaco after a race weekend. Bernard remembered Hill visiting with his family on many occasions; his son Damon visited the bar after retiring from the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix. Graham Hill had first visited Rosie's with his fellow Naval personnel during his time serving on .

Three main rock layers make up the mountain, the bottom layer containing multiple burrows and being primarily composed of limestone, marl, and shale, the middle layer, which is also the largest, being made up of limestone, marl, stromatolitic limestone and evaporites, and the top layer comprising mainly limestone. Geology The British, after surveying the mountain and sending samples to be tested in London in the summer of 1947, decided that it should be mined for gypsum. The Holloway Brothers were commissioned to oversee operations and to set up a mine railway to Umm Bab. A small labor camp was also established in the area. As much as 75 tons of gypsum had been quarried from the mountain by July 1948. The contract was later handed off to the C.A.T. Company, and by October 1948 the amount of gypsum extracted increased to 200 tons. From January 1949 to July 1949, a total of 420 tons had been extracted, and from August to the close of the year, 650 tons. Jacques Leblanc, a geologist working for Qatar Petroleum, notes that while the British report explicitly mentions Jebel Nakhsh, the mountain bears no apparent signs of exploitation and that it may be a case of mistaken identity. The Miocene Dam Formation is the predominant formation of Jebel Nakhsh and of that formation, the three members exposed on the mountain's surface are the 6-meter thick Abu Samrah Member on top, 33-meter thick Nakhsh Member in the middle and the 27-metre thick Salwa Member on the bottom. The Nakhsh Member is very rich in gypsum and is the only member of the Dam Formation to contain stromatolites. The bottom layer, largely made up of soft clays, is particularly fragile and chemical weathering of the clay surfaces has caused the underlying limestone to collapse in some areas, thus forming suitable abodes for certain desert mammals such as foxes and hyenas. There has also been instances recorded of mammals mechanically burrowing into these fragile surfaces. Its caves were first surveyed in 1983‚Äì84 by Peter Whybhrow. Jebel Nakhsh is in southern Qatar and falls within the boundaries of Al Rayyan Municipality. It is near the border with Saudi Arabia to the south and the Gulf of Salwah to the west. The hill of Qarn Abu Wayil is approximately 2 km to the south. History Rough sketch map drawn in 1936 showing Jebel Nakhsh The jebel was a site of contention in the early-to-mid 20th century between Ibn Saud and Amir Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani. Ibn Saud had wanted Jebel Nakhsh to be Saudi Arabia's frontier with Qatar. According to him, the Qatari Amir had previously signed an agreement ceding Jebel Nakhsh to him, although the Amir denied this. In a 1935 correspondence between British diplomats concerning the Saudi‚ÄìQatar frontier, the British claimed that \\"they [the Qataris] could never consent to attribute to Saudi Arabia features, such, for example, as the Jebel Naksh, which form an integral part of the physical structure of the Qatar Peninsula itself and have always, in fact, been an equally integral part of the Sheikhdom.\\" This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In the following weeks, a British communique stated that they \\"could not agree to deprive the Sheikh of any portion of the main block of that peninsula\\".

Story summary The narrator, a woman in Lima, Peru, does not write for publication; this account of her adventure will be kept in a trunk in the attic, to be found by future generations. She was inspired as a child by reading about expeditions to Antarctica, particularly The Voyage of the Discovery, Captain Scott's book about his expedition of 1902‚Äì1904. She plans, with several friends, a similar expedition. They find a benefactor, and the nine women, from Peru, Chile, and Argentina, meet in Punta Arenas in Chile in August 1909. They have hired the Yelcho, a steamer commanded by Captain Pardo. They sail to the Ross Sea, and at Hut Point they visit Captain Scott's hut; not liking the state it is in, they eventually decide to set up camp on the Great Ice Barrier, digging out cubicles in the ice. Grouped into two sledge teams and a support team, they journey south, covering about a day on level ice, and ascending the Florence Nightingale Glacier, as they have named it ‚Äì shown on maps as the Beardmore Glacier. They reach the South Pole on 22 December 1909. On returning to base camp, they realize that one of the group, Teresa, is pregnant. A baby girl is delivered, and Teresa names her Rosa ‚Äì Rosa del Sur (Rose of the South). The Yelcho returns to their camp as promised, and the group returns home. After the narrator learns of the Yelcho's role in rescuing Shackleton's men from Elephant Island, she writes to congratulate Captain Pardo, and thank him again. \\"Never one word has he breathed of our secret.

This process was intended to advance regional development and border reform. Successful steps have been taken. Angela Merkel, Georg Milbradt and Hugues Mingarelli praised the reforms.  Reforms  The decentralization reform had the following provisions: * Strengthen local government; * Change administrative-territorial structure; * Consolidate the ‚Äúprinciple of omnipresence‚Äù (local governments are defined by lands on the territory of settlements); * Empower local government with sufficient powers and resources; * Reflect historical, economic, environmental and cultural characteristics when planning the development of United territorial communities; * Transfer roles that local governments can perform to local authorities; The reform consists of three key components: * Reform of the territorial organisation of power * Reform of local self-government * Reform of regional policy  History  After Ukraine gained independence in 1991, the state increased local/regional government powers. In 1997 Ukraine ratified the European Charter of Local Self-Government, and adopted regulatory acts that established such powers. However, discussions concerning larger scale organisation as a rule concerned the distribution of powers at the national level. Following Euromaidan in 2014, the new government launched a national project \\"Decentralisation\\" (Ukrainian: –ù–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–π –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç \\"–î–µ—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—ñ–∑–∞—Ü—ñ—è\\"), on 1 April. The government of Volodymyr Groysman identified support for decentralisation as one of its priorities.  Results  During the reform, local budget revenues grew from UAH 68.6 billion in 2014 to UAH 146.6 billion in 2016. By the end of 2017, local budget revenues had reached UAH 170.7 billion. In addition, amalgamated hromadas became more active in the process of budget formation: during the first 10 months of 2017, amalgamated hromadas increased their own revenues by 80%, while national revenues grew by only 31.8%. In addition, per capita development expenditures in January-September 2017 increased by 225% compared to 2016 (for example: in communities without amalgamated hromada, growth was only 50%). From 2014 to 2017, state support for the development of amalgamated hromadas and their infrastructure increased from 0.5 billion UAH up to 14.9 billion UAH.

It has connected Landquart in the Alpine Rhine valley with the spa town of Davos since 1890. History In 1888, Dutchman Willem-Jan Holsboer (1834-1898), owner of a hotel in Davos, proposed a railway line from Landquart to Davos, envisioning that a railway would bring more visitors to the famous high valley than the horse-drawn carriages. He founded the Lanquart-Davos AG to begin construction of a standard-gauge line, but found that building it in the mountainous terrain was too costly due to the cramped conditions. Consequently on 29 June 1888, a ground-breaking ceremony took place for a narrow meter-gauge railway, Landquart-Davos Smalspurbahn. The line was opened in 1889 as far as the village of Klosters; the entire line to Davos was opened 21 July 1890. The line generally follows the Landquart River valley from Landquart station to Klosters Platz station at and then climbs, via two horseshoe turns through curved tunnels, up to Davos Wolfgang at before descending to the high valley, Davos Platz, at . In 1895, Holsboer changed his company's name, Landquart- Davos Smalspurbahn, to the Rhaetian Railway (German: Rh√§tische Bahn) to reflect his plans for network expansion.  Route description station is a major rail junction, where travelers from Z√ºrich or St. Gallen, who want to travel to Pr√§ttigau, Davos or the Vereina Tunnel to the lower Engadin can change from the standard gauge Chur‚ÄìRorschach railway of the Swiss Federal Railways (German: Schweizerische Bundesbahnen, SBB) to the metre-gauge trains of the RhB. Through RhB trains also run from Chur over the Landquart‚ÄìThusis railway to Klosters and Davos or Scuol-Tarasp. Platforms 5‚Äì8: Rhaetian Railway platforms at the Landquart railway station There are currently six platforms in use at the Landquart station. Platforms 2, 3 and 4 are served by SBB and Platforms 5, 6 and 8 are served by RhB. Platforms 1 and 7 are not normally used. After leaving Landquart station, the railway initially heads north, crosses the Landquart before turning east. The first 15 to 20 kilometre are very well developed and are approved for speeds of up to 90 km/h. The line leaves the shore of the Landquart to run to Malans station, but then returns to it and follows the river upstream as far as Klosters Platz. The line near Malans was originally planned to run next to the Landquart, but, since the populace of Malans wanted a connection to the rail network, it provided the necessary land for the line and thus made the small detour through Malans. Ge 4/4 I with a push-pull train with two extra carriages shortly before Saas; K√ºblis lies in the valley Gradient diagram of the route Between Malans and Seewis-Pardisla railway station in Seewis im Pr√§ttigau (593 m above sea level), the line has run through the 984 m-long Chlus Tunnel, which has bypassed a narrow ravine, the Chlus, since 1963. There is a parallel road tunnel for national route 28. After Gr√ºsch, the line reaches the three-track Schiers station following a double-track section. In 2008, the section after the station to the Fuchsenwinkel tunnel was also upgraded to double track. The line runs over two bridges over the Schraubach in the village of Schiers and over the Landquart, after which the line runs on the southern side of the Landquart. The line passes through another 786 m-long tunnel before the Fuchsenwinkel crossing loop, which starts at the eastern portal of the tunnel and consists of a 460 m-long siding. The line crosses the Landquart again before the next major station, K√ºblis. The section from K√ºblis to Klosters is the second steepest section of the line with a gradient of up to 4.4%. After Serneus, the line passes just north of the award-winning Sunniberg Bridge, which is the centerpiece of the Klosters bypass road that crosses the valley of the Landquart before entering the Gotschna Tunnel. In addition, the zigzag section of the line to Davos, which makes a horseshoe turn after Klosters Platz, can be seen up the mountain. After passing through Klosters Dorf, the line reaches Klosters Platz (only Klosters until 2011) station in the suburb of Klosters Platz.

Another through track serves freight traffic. Behind the station to its south lies the unusually massive Landquart bridge \\"IV\\" on a 45¬∞ bend. It represents the fourth and final crossing of Landquart on this line. Due to the unfavourable local conditions, it was built as a timber-truss bridge with half-timbered openings. It is also called the Maag Bridge after the clerk responsible for its construction at the Rigendinger engineering firm that built it. The double-track Maag bridge crosses the Landquart and leads to two tunnels: * The Zugwald Tunnel lies on the left (east side) and connects to the Vereina Tunnel, which was opened in 1999. This forms the centerpiece of the simultaneously opened line that connects the northern Grisons with the Lower Engadine. * The track on the right (west side) continues the line to Davos through the 402 m-long Klosters curved tunnel, which completes a horseshoe turn to the northwest. Here the gradient changes to its steepest 4.5%. After climbing above the Gotschna Tunnel, the line then makes another horseshoe turn in the opposite direction through the 334 m-long Cavad√ºrli curved tunnel and continues the climb to the southeast. The crossing station of Cavad√ºrli, which is a popular starting point for hikes, is already 160 m above Klosters Platz. Allegra ABe 8-12 between Davos Wolfgang and Davos Dorf The line then climbs through dense forests of larch and other coniferous trees to Davos Laret station. The highest point on the line is at the stop of Davos Wolfgang at . The line then runs downhill into the high valley and along Lake Davos to Davos Dorf station and on to Davos Platz at . The station is the terminus of this line, where it merges into the Davos Platz‚ÄìFilisur railway. Davos Platz railway station A parliamentary initiative launched in 2008 to connect this line with the Arosa Railway is currently not considered a priority by the Grisons government in the light of tight financial resources.

From the 1890s, together with her sister Gyrithe Lemche, she was an active member of the Danish Women's Society where from 1901 she edited Kvinden & Samfundet. Early life and family Born in Copenhagen on 1 August 1861, Vibeke Ingeborg Frisch was the daughter of the headmaster Hartvig Frisch (1833‚Äì90) and Elisabeth Alexandra Mourier (1835‚Äì92). She was the elder sister of the feminist Gyrithe Lemche (1866‚Äì1945). On 18 October 1884, she married the translator Gerhard Guise Salicath (1859‚Äì1937) with whom she had six children, most of whom died as children: Constance Frederikke (1885), Erik (1886‚Äì88), Viggo (1887‚Äì88), Peter (1891‚Äì98), and the twins Karen and Kirsten Emilie (1902), Karen being the only one to survive infancy. She was raised in a comfortable environment in Lyngby where her family moved to Wilhelminelyst when she was still young. It was there she met Gerhard Salicath whom she married in 1884. The couple moved to more modest accommodation on Copenhagen's Vesterbro. After a series of family problems, she left her husband in 1903 but refused his request for a divorce. Professional life It was together with another single mother, the journalist Valborg Andersen, that Salicath founded the women's hostel Kvindeherberget in 1902, later known as Kvindehjemmet in the N√∏rrebro district of Copenhagen. Providing philanthropic services for unmarried mothers with children, the institution's innovative approach helped to change attitudes towards single women in unfortunate circumstances. In the 1890s, Salicath had become a member of the Women's Society, encouraging her sisters Gyrithe and Asta to join too. She was a board member of the organization's Copenhagen chapter from 1900, becoming vice-president in 1905. She became editor of Kvinden & Samfundet in 1901, but also contributed articles to other women's journals including Kvindernes Blad, Frou-Frou, Husmoderens Blad and Hjemmet. As an active player in the Danish women's movement, women's suffrage became her primary concern, especially after she had participated in the 1904 Berlin Conference of the International Council of Women, where the International Woman Suffrage Alliance was launched. From 1907 to 1908, succeeding Louise N√∏rlund, she headed the Women's Society's Suffrage Union. Representing the conservative party H√∏jre, she was one of the first seven women to be elected to the Citizens' Representation (Borgerrepr√¶sentationen) in 1909, where she took a particular interest in the N√¶rumg√•rd children's home. In 1914, she co- founded the Danish Women's Conservative Association (Danske Kvinders Konservative Forening). Vibeke Salicath died in Copenhagen on 22 April 1921. She is buried in Lyngby's Assistens Cemetery.

He was assistant director of Oxford University Computing Services (OUCS) from 2001 to September 2010 where he officially retired from OUCS. Prior to that, he was manager of the Humanities Computing Unit at OUCS for five years. He has worked in ICT support for research in the humanities since the 1990s. He was one of the founding editors of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and continues to play an active part in its maintenance and development, as a consultant to the TEI Technical Council and as an elected TEI board member. He has played a key role in the establishment of many other key activities and initiatives in this area, such as the UK Arts and Humanities Data Service, and the British National Corpus and has published and lectured widely. Since 2008 he has also worked as a Member of the Conseil Scientifique for the CNRS-funded \\"Adonis\\" TGE.  Education & Career  He gained a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford University, graduated with a first in English in 1968, a MPhil in 19th century English Studies(1973), MA (1979). He went on to teach English at the University of Malawi between 1972 and 1974. His first job for the University Computing Service was as a data centre operator. He described it as sitting in a large room in the Department of Atmospheric Physics, with a line printer, a card reader, a card punch and three teletype devices. The one he sat in front of told the time every five minutes and the date every half hour. If it stopped doing either, he had instructions to call an engineer. Aside from light duties tearing up output from the line printer, that was essentially all he had to do for his 8-hour shift. He learned to program in Algol68, created a concordance to the songs of Bob Dylan, and finally got a job as a programmer in 1974. He claimed the first real program he wrote was 12 lines of assembler to link a PDP-8 driven graphics display to an ICL 1900 mainframe. He learned Snobol4, and worked with Susan Hockey on the design of the Oxford Concordance Program (OCP). He also worked on network database management systems, notably Cullinane's IDMS, and on ICL's CAFS text search engine. In 1976 he set up the Oxford Text Archive together with Susan Hockey. After flirting briefly with applications of computers in History under the tutelage of Manfred Thaller, he succumbed to the lure of SGML in 1988 following the Poughkeepsie Conference which launched the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) project of which he has been European editor since February 1989. The Oxford electronic Shakespeare (1989) published by the Oxford University Press was the first to offer a commercial e-text encoded for analysis. William Montgomery, one of the associate editors, and Lou Burnard encoded each poem or play with COCOA tags so that it could be processed by Micro-Oxford Concordance Program. Since October 1990 he has also been responsible for OUCS participation in the British National Corpus Project a 100 million word corpus of modern British English. He initiated the Xaira (XML Aware Indexing and Retrieval Architecture) project, an advanced text searching software system for XML resources, originally developed for searching the British National Corpus, it was funded by the Mellon Foundation between 2005‚Äì6.

Under the scheme, General Practitioners (GPs), Paediatricians and Psychiatrists with a Medicare provider number are able to refer patients to eligible allied health practitioners for treatment of mental health conditions under Medicare. The scheme is a key component of health care in Australia and aims to improve the treatment and management of mental illness within the Australian community. The introduction of the Better Access scheme has provided over 30 million individual treatment services for Australians with mental health disorders since its inception. History There were a number of events that raised the profile of mental health in Australia and culminated with the introduction of the Better Access initiative. Public interest in mental health was heightened in late 2005 by the publicity surrounding the inquiry into the wrongful detention of psychiatric patient Cornelia Rau as an illegal immigrant, and the release of the Mental Health Council of Australia's 'Not for Service' report. A 2006 Senate inquiry into Australia's mental health system called for sweeping changes to mental health services. The Productivity Commission's report on Australia's health workforce was also released in January 2006 and identified a number of systemic problems relating to community access to mental health services as part of a National Action Plan for Mental Health. The commission's report recommended reforms in mental health service delivery and an extension of Medicare rebates to allied health professionals. The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) raised the issue of mental health as an issue of national significance in February 2006, resulting in the Australian Government announcing a $1.9 billion increase in funding for mental health services. As part of these COAG mental health reforms, the government announced the Better Access initiative for people with mental health disorders to access services from eligible allied health professionals. The scheme built on some of the strengths of an earlier program, Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care, that was established in 2001. This program allowed GPs to claim for using psychological services after completing training in psychoeducation, interpersonal therapy and cognitive behavior therapy. Better Access was launched in November 2006 by then Minister for Health and Ageing Tony Abbott after extensive consultation with the Australian Psychological Society and other mental health groups. The scheme initially provided 12 sessions per calendar year, delivered in two sets of 6 sessions, with 18 sessions available in exceptional circumstances. Additionally the scheme allowed for 12 group treatment sessions per calendar year for those in a group with 6 to 10 patients. However this was subsequently reduced to 10 individual and 10 group treatment sessions per calendar year in November 2011. The reduction in the number of sessions available under the scheme was strongly opposed by psychologists and community members. Telehealth services In November 2017, the Australian Government announced $9.1 million in funding to improve access to mental health treatment services for people in regional, rural and remote areas. Eligible patients with a Mental Health Treatment Plan or valid referral from a Paediatrician or Psychiatrist are able to claim rebates for psychological treatment via video consultations through the Better Access initiative. Telehealth services can be delivered by psychologists, occupational therapists and social workers. Eating disorders In December 2018, the Australian government announced expanded mental health treatment for patients with eating disorders. People with eligible eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia will have access to a comprehensive plan through Medicare, including up to 40 subsidised psychological services and 20 dietetic services in a 12 month period. The Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that $110 million in funding would be rolled out over four years as part of the Medicare package. Impact to the psychology profession Under the Better Access program clients of psychologists with a general registration receive a rebate of $87.45 for sessions of 50+ minutes. Clients of psychologists endorsed in Clinical Psychology https://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Endorsement.aspx are rebated $128.40 for 50+ minute sessions. The disparity in rebates has led to the formation of a new professional association called the Australian Association of Psychologists (AAPi), who advocate for fairness in the profession across all types of psychologists and areas of psychology, and improve access to mental services to the population. Since the introduction of the Better Access Scheme in 2006 and the two-tier rebate system, there has been a significant increase in student demand for places in clinical psychology postgraduate programs compared to other psychology postgraduate programs. With the exception of clinical psychology, all psychology postgraduate programs leading to an area of practice endorsement have dramatically declined including those in counselling, community, health, forensic, educational and developmental and sport and exercise psychology. In contrast, Master of Professional Psychology programs have significantly increased over the same period. https://www.psychology.org.au/inpsych/2016/april/feature Criticisms There have been several criticisms of the Better Access initiative since its inception. Psychiatrist Ian Hickie has raised concerns over the scheme, stating that giving psychologists Medicare rebates risks turning the profession into a ‚Äúcottage industry‚Äù. Hickie has previously advocated that multidisciplinary teams are the best way to deliver higher-quality mental health care and for the Better Access scheme to be capped at 10 sessions per calendar year. Sebastian Rosenberg, Senior Lecturer at the Brain and Mind Centre, has also been critical of the reduced oversight of General Practitioners in the scheme, suggesting ‚ÄúGPs have allowed their role in Better Access to dwindle to that of glorified referrers‚Äù. The Brain and Mind Centre has estimated the cost of expanding access to the scheme at $2 billion and has suggested funding for mental health services could be better spent elsewhere. However, supporters of the scheme point out that mental health is estimated to cost the economy more than $60 billion annually in lost productivity and that Better Access has been enormously successful in providing accessible, effective, and relatively low cost mental health services, particularly for people with high-prevalence disorders such as depression and anxiety. A prominent concern of the Better Access initiative is its limited distribution of mental health care to rural, regional and remote areas. Better Access activity rates are typically greater in urban and more advantaged areas. However, this same criticism has also been leveled at other mental health services. Among psychiatrists, only one-third of the rural workforce live in rural Australia with most travelling from cities or using telepsychiatry. Activity rates for Better Access Medicare items across all practitioners decline with increasing remoteness. There is also considerable variability between provider disciplines and Medicare items within the scheme, leading some critics to cite quality control issues. This is particularly the case with the psychologist service providers leading to much acrimony within the profession.https://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Standards-and- Guidelines/FAQ/Internship-FAQ.aspx This acrimony has manifested primarily in groups like RAPS publishing claims on social media that young female psychology students were offering sexual favours in exchange for votes supporting the APS College of Clinical Psychologists in APS elections, and statements of support for psychologists under investigation by AHPRA for publicly asserting that newly graduated clinical psychologists were \\"bumbling fools stumbling over their textbooks\\".https://www.facebook.com/reformaps/ The Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW) and Occupational Therapists Australia have called for a change in the official title of the initiative, pointing out that the existing title neglects the role of social workers and occupational therapists. The AASW has argued that the existing title may mislead clients into assuming that Medicare rebateable services are only provided by Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners under the initiative.

It saw active service on the Western Front at the Somme, Vimy Ridge and Ypres, against the German Spring Offensive, and in the final Hundred Days Offensive. Mobilisation The 114th Siege Bty was formed at Pembroke Dock under Army Council Instruction 535 of 8 March 1916, which laid down that it was to follow the establishment for 'New Army' (Kitchener's Army) units, with a Territorial Force (TF) cadre of three officers and 78 men (the wartime establishment of an RGA Company of the TF) from the Pembroke Royal Garrison Artillery.Army Council Instructions for March 1916.Frederick, pp. 703‚Äì4.

By now massive quantities of artillery were employed for each phase of the offensive as Fourth Army attacked again and again through the autumn:Farndale, pp. 149‚Äì56.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 102‚Äì9. * Battle of Morval (25‚Äì28 September) * Battle of Le Transloy (1‚Äì18 October) * Battle of the Ancre Heights (3‚Äì11 November) * Battle of the Ancre (13‚Äì18 November) The battery was withdrawn from the line for rest, training etc. from 27 December to 20 January 1917. Vimy The battery moved to 44th (South African) HAG with First Army on 22 March 1917. The group supported the Canadian Corps at the Battle of Vimy Ridge on 9 April. The artillery plan for the heavy guns emphasised counter-battery (CB) fire. At Zero hour, while the field guns laid down a Creeping barrage to protect the advancing infantry, the heavy howitzers fired further ahead to hit the rear areas on the reverse slope of the ridge, especially known gun positions. The attack went in on 9 April with the Canadian Corps successfully capturing Vimy Ridge. Fighting in the southern sector (the Battle of Arras) continued into May.Farndale, pp. 164‚Äì6, 174‚Äì6, Map 23.Cave, pp. 119‚Äì27, Map p. 121.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 74‚Äì8. 114th Siege Bty remained with First Army, transferring to 77th HAG on 15 April, to 18th HAG on 15 May and then moving to 71st HAG on 28 May (actually joining it 3 June). However, on 12 June it joined 88th HAG with Second Army in the Ypres Salient, coming under Fifth Army by 1 August during the Battle of Pilckem Ridge) that launched the Third Ypres Offensive. Just before the battle, on 28 July, a section from the newly-arrived 376th Siege Bty joined, bringing 114th Siege Bty up to a strength of six howitzers.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 114‚Äì20. 6-inch howitzer being moved through mud on the Western Front. Ypres Gun batteries were packed into the Ypres Salient ‚Äì II Corps had 36 RGA batteries in the Dickebusch area ‚Äì where they were under observation and CB fire from the Germans on the higher ground. Casualties among guns and gunners were high, and II Corps had failed to make much progress. A second push on 16 August (the Battle of Langemarck) suffered from rushed artillery planning and was unsuccessful. The offensive continued through the summer and autumn of 1917: the Battles of the Menin Road, Polygon Wood and Broodseinde were highly successful because of the weight of artillery brought to bear on German positions. But as the offensive continued with the Battle of Poelcappelle and First and Second Battles of Passchendaele, the tables were turned: British batteries were clearly observable from the Passchendaele Ridge and were subjected to CB fire, while their own guns sank into the mud and became difficult to aim and fire.Farndale, pp. 197‚Äì213, Map 26.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 150-1, 158‚Äì60, 163, 174, 185.Wolff, pp. 223‚Äì35, 249‚Äì51. There was no respite for the gunners: although 88th HAG moved out of the Salient in October, 114th Siege Bty stayed with Fifth Army, transferring to 68th HAG on 1 October. By now HAG allocations were becoming more fixed, and on 1 February 1918 they were converted into permanent RGA brigades. 68th Brigade was defined as an '8-inch Howitzer' brigade, but only one of its units was equipped with such guns, the remainder operating 6-inch howitzers. 114th Siege Bty remained with this brigade until the Armistice.Farndale, Annex E.Farndale, Annex M. Spring Offensive Fifth Army was attacked on 21 March 1918, the first day of the German Spring Offensive. Artillery Observation Posts (OPs) were blinded by early morning mist and many were overrun along with the infantry in the forward zone. The German bombardment was savage. The batteries of 68th Bde were with XIX Corps, which was particularly hard hit, the attackers forcing their way down the flanks of the two front line divisions. Cavalry and infantry reserves held the line for a while and 68th Bde was still intact at the end of the first day, unlike some heavy units in other parts of the front, either caught in the fighting or forced to abandon their guns as the Germans advanced rapidly.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 244‚Äì6.Blaxland, pp. 45‚Äì6.Farndale, pp. 262‚Äì6.Muirland, pp. 74‚Äì90. Next day the Germans continued their advance, and 68th Bde stood at Roise trying to stem the tide before pulling out after dark. On 23 March XIX Corps was forced to conform to retreats by its neighbours towards the Somme, and over following days the RGA struggled to get their guns back during the 'Great Retreat'.Blaxland, pp. 56‚Äì7.Farndale, pp. 268‚Äì70.Murland, p. 146. Fourth Army HQ took over all of Fifth Army's formations and units on 2 April. The last attack in the first phase of the German offensive came in on 4 April (the Battle of the Avre). The two divisions now holding the front were pushed back, but they were backed by a mass of field and heavy artillery, including the batteries of 68th Bde, and the attack was stopped dead by the guns.Blaxland, pp. 98, 103‚Äì6.Farndale, pp. 276‚Äì9. Further attacks came on other parts of the front for several months, but none broke through completely. Hundred Days The Allied Hundred Days Offensive opened at 04.20 on 8 August at the Battle of Amiens. By now 68th Bde was supporting the Australian Corps on whose front the barrage fired by field and heavy artillery was so thick and accurate that scarcely a German shell fell after 05.40, and all the Australian objectives were secured.Blaxland, pp. 67‚Äì71.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 61‚Äì73.Farndale, Western Front, p. 290. The Allied advance continued through the autumn up to the River Selle. Preparations to cross it began on 11 October, with 68th Bde allocated to the II US Corps, which was operating under Fourth Army's command and had no artillery of its own. The weather was misty, which hindered air and ground observation for counter-battery fire, but when the assault went in on the morning of 17 October the Selle itself was not much of an obstacle on II US Corps' front, and the objectives were taken.Blaxland, pp. 250‚Äì2.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, pp. 188, 296‚Äì8, 305‚Äì8.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 307‚Äì8.Yockelson, pp. 89‚Äì90, 200‚Äì5. For the final part of the Battle of the Selle on 23 October, II US Corps was relieved by the British IX Corps, which took over most of its Australian and RGA artillery.Edmopnds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, p. 325.Yockelson, pp. 207‚Äì8. This massive corps artillery reserve supported the attack into the wooded slopeds beyond the Selle. Again, bad weather hindered air observation and CB work before the attack, but the barrage was deadly accurate. As the regimental historian relates, \\"The guns of Fourth Army demonstrated, on 23rd October, the crushing effect of well co- ordinated massed artillery. They simply swept away the opposition\\".Farndale, Western Front, pp. 311‚Äì2.

He composed the piece on a commission from the Irish Louth Contemporary Music Society. It was published by Universal Edition in 2007 and first performed in Louth, Ireland, in February 2008.  History  The work was commissioned by the Louth Contemporary Music Society. The text is the final part of a traditional prayer for protection, Saint Patrick's Breastplate, attributed to St. Patrick, the primary patron saint of Ireland. The text is known as \\"The Deer's Cry\\", \\"The Breastplate of St Patrick\\", or \\"Lorica\\"Hill, Thomas. \\"Invocation of the Trinity and the Tradition of the Lorica in Old English Poetry\\". Speculum, volume 56, No. 2, April 1981. pp. 259‚Äì267 and is often attributed to the saint. P√§rt wrote his setting in modern English, beginning with \\"Christ with me\\", composed for a four-part choir a cappella. It was published by Universal Edition in 2007, and was first performed by the State Choir Latvija, conducted by Fergus Sheil, in Louth on 13 February 2008. The Deer's Cry is in one movement and takes about five minutes to perform.  Text  P√§rt set an excerpt of the prayer, its conclusion, and repeating the first line of that section (\\"Christ with me\\") in the end:  Music  The music is in A minor, consisting of slow, marked quarter notes as 72 per minute. The measures contain different even numbers of them, from two, often used for general rests, to eight. The lower voices begin with divided altos and basses, rendering \\"Christ is with me\\" four times in homophony with long rests in between. While they keep that pattern, the sopranos enter in the seventh measure to deliver the following text. From measure 17, the lower voices also take part in the text, singing \\"Christ in me\\". They are often juxtaposed to the sopranos, such as with \\"arise\\" vs. \\"sit down\\". A climax is reached in measure 33 when all the voices sing in homophony, and every one divided: \\"Christ in the heart ...\\". After the text is completed, followed by a general rest, all voices sing, similar to the beginning: \\"Christ with me\\", once softly, finally very soft and diminishing.  Performance and recording  In 2016, the Sixteen choir named a program of music by William Byrd and P√§rt The Deer's Cry, which they performed in several venues. A collection of choral music by P√§rt by the Estonian vocal group Vox Clamantis, conducted by Jaan-Eik Tulve, was performed under the same name. A reviewer notes the pure intonation required for the spiritual purity of the music.

Minong is the Ojibwe name for Isle Royale, and the TCP designation recognizes the lasting relationship the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa has with the island. The TCP covers the island itself, the greater archipelago, and the traditional fishing waters surrounding the islands. History and significance Archeological evidence suggests that the Ojibwe have used Minong for fishing and copper mining far back in prehistoric times, but it is unclear whether this evidence is from people from the Grand Portage Band or another closely related tribe. The first known written document that confirms Ojibwe on Minong dates from . Travel to and from Minong from the mainland was common during this time period. As Europeans moved into the area, the Ojibwe became involved with commercial trapping and fishing, and commercial and subsistence fishing on Isle Royale continued for many decades into the nineteenth century. During the twentieth century, members of the Grand Portage Band continued to use Minong for subsistence hunting, fishing, trapping, and maple sugaring, as well as commercial ventures in these areas. Some members were also involved in resort and recreation on the island. This continues to the present day, as the Band opened the Grand Portage Marina in 1971, providing a place for boats to leave from Grand Portage to Isle Royale National Park for fishing and diving expeditions. Contributing elements The contributing elements to the Minong Traditional Cultural Property are natural places, including harbors and coves, rather than specific buildings or docks. These elements include the Grand Portage Band's traditional use areas on the island, as well as locations of specific historical significance. Natural elements include McCargoe Cove, Todd Harbor, Siskiwit Bay, Checker Point, Indian Point, Grace Point and Island, Sugar Mountain, Greenstone Beach, Chippewa Harbor, Camelian Beach, Rock Harbor, Pickeral Cove, Fishermans Home, and Washington Harbor. These represent places that the Grand Portage Ojibwe used as miners, fishermen, tour guides, or other uses. The TCP also includes one off-site contributing feature: the Little Cedar Spirit Tree, or Manito Geezhigaynce, which is located on the north side of Hat Point on the Grand Portage Indian Reservation.

Management  The marine protected areas of South Africa are the responsibility of the national government, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, in this case, the Eastern Cape Provincial Tourism Agency, (ECPTA), which manages the MPA with funding from the SA Government through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement.  Scuba diving  The many rivers along this coast carry silt and during the rainy season the visibility is often poor. Strong currents are common. May and June are often the best months for diving this region. Water temperatures range from about 25¬∞C in summer to about 19¬∞C in winter. The sub-tidal environment is mainly shelving rocky reefs parallel to the coastline. The best diving is in the 12 to 40 m depth range. In the northern parts of the MPA reefs are generally within 3 km of the shore. Launches may be from Port Edward or Mbotyi. There is diveable reef off the Mzamba river just outside the MPA, and further south off the Mnyameni River in the northern controlled area, and off the Sikombe river at the border of the restricted zone. Further south there is a large area of reef off the Mtentu River inside the no-take zone, and off the Mkhambati reserve near Mgwegwe. Further south the visibility is often poor due to upwelling from an eddy between Port St Johns and Waterfall bluff.  Geography   General topography  The MPA covers the continental shelf, which is narrow in this region, and the upper continental slope to 1000m depth.  Climate   Seasonal variations in sea conditions   Ecology  Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: Pondoland Marine Protected Area is in the Agulhas ecoregion (describe position, biodiversity and endemism of the region) The MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas ecoregion to the east of Cape Point which extends eastwards to the Mbashe River. There are a large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. This part of the coastal waters is a transition zone with elements of sub-tropical and warm temperate ecosystems. Four major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Some of these may have Kelp forests, which reduce the effect of waves and provide food and shelter for an extended range of organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. There are no significant estuarine habitats in the MPA. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near-horizontal crevices. Kelp forests Kelp forests are a variation of rocky reefs, as the kelp requires a fairly strong and stable substrate which can withstand the loads of repeated waves dragging on the kelp plants. The Sea bamboo Ecklonia maxima grows in water which is shallow enough to allow it to reach to the surface with its gas-filled stipes, so that the fronds form a dense layer at or just below the surface, depending on the tide. The shorter Split-fan kelp Laminaria pallida grows mostly on deeper reefs, where there is not so much competition from the sea bamboo. Both these kelp species provide food and shelter for a variety of other organisms, particularly the Sea bamboo, which is a base for a wide range of epiphytes, which in turn provide food and shelter for more organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. Sandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand. The open sea The pelagic water column is the major part of the living space at sea. This is the water between the surface and the top of the benthic zone, where living organisms swim, float or drift, and the food chain starts with phytoplankton, the mostly microscopic photosynthetic organisms that convert the energy of sunlight into organic material which feeds nearly everything else, directly or indirectly. In temperate seas there are distinct seasonal cycles of phytoplankton growth, based on the available nutrients and the available sunlight. Either can be a limiting factor. Phytoplankton tend to thrive where there is plenty of light, and they themselves are a major factor in restricting light penetration to greater depths, so the photosynthetic zone tends to be shallower in areas of high productivity. Zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton, and are in turn eaten by larger animals. The larger pelagic animals are generally faster moving and more mobile, giving them the option of changing depth to feed or to avoid predation, and to move to other places in search of a better food supply. The area is a transitional ecosystem, so the marine life is a mix of subtropical and warm-temperate species with a high variation from north to south along the coast. The restricted zone is fully protected from fishing, and is distinctly richer in fish life, particularly large predators. The benthic community is dominated by coralline seaweeds, gorgonian sea fans and large sponges, as the MPA is too far south of the equator for warm-water reef-building corals.

The validity of the conjecture was proved for a number of well- known systems having global attractor (e.g. for the global attractors in the Lorenz system , complex Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau equation). It is named after Alp Eden, who proposed it in 1987. Eden was a PhD student of Ciprian Foias. Kuznetsov- Eden's conjecture For local attractors, a conjecture on the Lyapunov dimension of self-excited attractor, refined by N. Kuznetsov, is stated that for a typical system, the Lyapunov dimension of a self-excited attractor does not exceed the Lyapunov dimension of one of the unstable equilibria, the unstable manifold of which intersects with the basin of attraction and visualizes the attractor. The conjecture is valid, e.g., for the classical self-excited Lorenz attractor; for the self-excited attractors in the Henon map (even in the case of multistability and coexistence of local attractors with different Lyapunov dimensions). For a hidden attractor the conjecture is that the maximum of the local Lyapunov dimensions is achieved on an unstable periodic orbit embedded into the attractor.

Early on he received violin lessons, in Graz and also speech and singing lessons. In 1911‚Äì15 he was engaged in the Graz Opera, in 1915‚Äì18 at the Wiener Volksoper, and from 1919 to 1934 at the Wiener Staatsoper. According to the Salzburg Festival: history and repertoire, 1922-1926 he appeared at the Salzburg Festival. He was professor at the Vienna Music Academy. Manowarda had joined the NSDAP together with his wife before 1933 and remained politically active even after the party ban in 1933 by distributing propaganda material to the staff of the Vienna State Opera and refusing to wear the badge of the Vaterl√§ndische Front despite threats of severe punishment. According to his own statements, this caused him political difficulties, which is why he moved to the Berlin State Opera under Clemens Krauss in 1935.Stra√üennamen Wiens seit 1860 als ‚ÄûPolitische Erinnerungsorte‚Äú (PDF; 4,4‚ÄìMB), p. 51f, Forschungsprojektendbericht, Wien, Juli 2013 Already in 1931 he sang his way to great success at the Bayreuth Festival as the Landgrave in Tannh√§user under Arturo Toscanini. After his move to Berlin, Manowarda was particularly popular with Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels and used this attention to propose in 1936 to Heinz Tietjen the unification of the Staatstheaters of Berlin and Kassel with the Burgtheater and the Vienna State Opera. However, the project was never realized due to internal power distribution struggles of the National Socialist leadership elite; further petitions to Hitler also remained unsuccessful. More appearances in Bayreuth followed until 1942, among them as Gurnemanz in the 1937 production of Parsifal. Manowarda was married to the opera singer Cornelia \\"Nelly\\" Pirchhoff-Manowarda. He is buried at the cemetery in Berlin Bezirk Spandau.  Awards  Manowarda was awarded the honorary title of Kammers√§nger in 1929. After Manowarda's death, a funeral service was held at the Berlin State Opera in January 1943, attended by Goebbels and Hermann G√∂ring. In G√∂ring's speech, Manowarda was described as a \\"faithful, uncompromising and victory-believing henchman of the F√ºhrer\\".

Her body was found in Nairobi's City mortuary on 12 February where it had been registered under a different name. Police reports established that she had died on 7 February. A post-mortem examination determined that she died due to exsanguination. The bleeding was caused by a rupture at the rear of her uterus, reportedly as the result of an unsafe abortion. The remains of a male fetus were still in the womb, minus a hand. Her father and husband told reporters that they did not believe police reports, since they were unaware that she had been pregnant. Patrick Gathara of The Washington Post noted skepticism was warranted, since police had been involved with covering up the murders of human rights defenders in the past. A second independent autopsy confirmed the cause of death. Amnesty International Kenya stated: \\"If Mwatha was not killed by State execution, she was killed by a system that allows crude abortion clinics to exist for its failure to provide safe abortion services.\\" Memorial services were held on 21 February at Uhuru Park's Freedom Corner. They were attended by Chief Justice Willy Mutunga, politician Martha Karua and Nairobi Women Representative Esther Passaris. A Requiem Mass was refused by the Catholic Church because of its opposition to abortion. The funeral was on 23 February in Asembo Bay, Siaya County near her family's home.

Pelletier (April 25, 1872‚ÄìMarch 25, 1924) was district attorney of Suffolk County, Massachusetts and the Supreme Advocate of the Knights of Columbus. He was removed as district attorney and disbarred for blackmail and extortion. Early life Pelletier was born April 25, 1872, in Roxbury, to William Summers Pelletier, a successful merchant and banker described as \\"a model of goodness in his personal life.\\" He attended the Boston Public Schools and then Boston College where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1891 and a master's degree in 1893. He earned a law degree from Boston University in 1895, the year after he passed the bar exam. Knights of Columbus Pelletier was a charter member of Franklin Council number 168 of the Knight of Columbus and its first Deputy Grand Knight when it was instituted on April 26, 1896. In 1898 he was elected Grand Knight and served two terms as District Deputy from 1898 to 1900. He was State Deputy of the Massachusetts Knights of Columbus from 1901 until 1906, during which time he oversaw the institution of the Boston Chapter, a group of Grand Knights who collaborated to work on larger projects. He served five terms as state deputy, more than anyone else. While state deputy, the state convention was held outside of Boston several times, to great success. He was Master of the Fourth Degree in Massachusetts in 1900. He served as a delegate to the Supreme Convention from 1900 to 1908, and served as a Supreme Director from 1901 to 1907. He provided legal advice to the Order as Supreme Advocate for 15 years, from 1907 to 1922, He also served as a member of the Knights of Columbus Commission on Religious Prejudice. He was a member of the War Activities Committee to provide services for American troops in World War I and, following the war, he was appointed the Education Committee to run a series of night schools for returning veterans. France awarded Pelletier the Legion of Honor and Belgium made him a Knight of the Crown for his services during the war. Pope Benedict XV made him a knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. After his death, the Massachusetts state council established a scholarship in his name at Boston College. He was friends with Supreme Knight Edward L. Hearn. Public office In 1905, Pelletier was appointed to the Massachusetts Civil Service Commission by Governor William Lewis Douglas. He was reappointed by Republican Governors Curtis Guild Jr. and Eben Sumner Draper. He resigned from the board in 1909 in order to focus on his campaign for district attorney. Pelletier was first elected as district attorney in 1909. He easily defeated Edward P. Barry, Felix W. McGettrick, and Alonzo D. Moran at the county convention to win the Democratic nomination (receiving 149 of the necessary 117 votes on the first ballot) and beat Republican incumbent Arthur D. Hill in the general election. He took office on November 13, 1909. In 1911, Pelletier prosecuted Clarence Richeson for the murder of his girlfriend Avis Willard Linnell. Richeson was found guilty and Pelletier recommended the death penalty. Richeson was executed on May 21, 1912. In 1912, Pelletier was a candidate for governor. He lost the Democratic nomination to incumbent Eugene N. Foss by 16,000 votes. In 1917, Pelletier petitioned Governor Samuel W. McCall for leniency in the treatment of Jesse Pomeroy, who had been living in solitary confinement at the Charlestown State Prison for more than 40 years. Pomeroy's sentence was commuted to the extent of allowing him the privileges afforded to other life prisoners.Gribben, Mark. \\"Jesse Harding Pomeroy.\\" Crime Library. 17. Resurrection. Retrieved on November 27, 2010. In 1921, Pelletier was a candidate for Mayor of Boston. He dropped out of the race shortly before the election and backed James Michael Curley. Removal from office In 1916, the Watch and Ward Society began efforts to remove Pelletier from office. According to Pelletier, this was because he refused to present complaints procured by their spotters to a jury. After a complaint to the state legislature's Joint Judiciary Committee was dismissed in the winter of 1916, the society went to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which twice found their charges unworthy of a hearing. After this the group took its efforts before the Boston Bar Association. In November 1919, Pelletier discovered his private office in Pemberton Square had been wiretapped. He traced the wires back to an office paid for by Godfrey Lowell Cabot, president of the Watch and Ward Society. Cabot justified the recording device by saying he needed incriminating evidence to remove Pelletier from office. The society had also hired a private detective to keep the district attorney under surveillance for two years. On September 29, 1921, the Boston Bar Association recommended to Massachusetts Attorney General J. Weston Allen that Pelletier be removed from office, alleging that he was guilty of deceit, malpractice, and gross misconduct. The trial began on December 28, 1921, with Senator James A. Reed of Missouri representing Pelletier. Reed claimed that Pelletier was the victim of the Watch and Ward Society's anti-Catholic vendetta. Late in the trial, former Middlesex County district attorney William J. Corcoran turned state's evidence against Pelletier and his co-conspirators. On February 21, 1922, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found Pelletier guilty of 10 of the 21 charges against him and removed him from office. Chief Justice Arthur P. Rugg wrote in the court's opinion that Pelletier had \\"prostituted\\" his office and used the processes of law \\"as instruments of oppression in an attempt to wrest money from the blameless and aged\\" by repeatedly using his position to aid in blackmail and extortion. Four of these cases involved Pelletier's close friend Daniel H. Coakley. The court described their relationship as \\"conspirators to exert the power of the district attorney to extort money, to terrorize people into surrendering causes of action and otherwise to abuse that office\\". Later life and death On May 8, 1922, Pelletier was disbarred. On June 29, 1922 he resigned as supreme advocate of the Knights of Columbus, citing \\"propaganda\\" from his \\"enemies outside the order\\". He was succeeded by Luke E. Hart. Pelletier sought to return to the district attorney's office in the 1922 election. He defeated his successor, Thomas C. O'Brien by a 2 to 1 margin in the Democratic primary. However, O'Brien, who won the Republican nomination, defeated Pelletier 56% to 42% in the general election. Pelletier died on March 25, 1924 at his home in Boston.

Born in Melbourne, Duman is reported to have been a friend of Tara Nettleton and Khaled Sharrouf, who travelled from Australia to Daesh territory, with their five children, in 2014. Duman's online recruiting activities have been the subject of scholarly attention. Duman married an Australian jihadist named Mahmoud Abdullatif, who was killed in action five weeks after their marriage. Duman was described as an active recruiter of volunteers, who taunted Australian authorities to \\"catch me if you can\\". In \\"Fatal Attraction: Western Muslimas and ISIS\\", Anita Pere≈°in identified Duman as a female jihad supporter who claimed to want to personally undertake suicide mission or engage in combat. Provocative photos Duman tweeted, of herself and four other women, clad head to toe in black, holding AK-47 rifles, and posing over an expensive sports car, have been widely republished. In February 2019, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation obtained a video of Duman, where she described herself as the best friend of late Tara Nettleton, who died in 2015. In the video she said that Nettleton's three surviving children, Zaynab Sharrouf, Hoda Sharrouf and Hamzah Sharrouf, remained in the Daesh-occupied territory, but that they were \\"fine\\", the last time she saw them. On February 28, 2019, Dateline interviewed Duman's mother, who had recently heard from Duman. Duman's mother told Naima Brown of Dateline that, by 2017, Duman had grown disenchanted with Daesh, and wanted to come home to Australia, but couldn't because of Daesh's intense scrutiny of those living in its territory. On March 14, 2019, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that an Australian woman who declined to identify herself, but who was believed to be Duman, was staying in the al Hawl refugee camp, trying to return to Australia with her two children. She described a terrible shortage of food, and her fears her 6 month old daughter would starve to death. On October 7, 2019, Duman had her Australian citizenship revoked. The New Daily reported that Duman, and other Australian citizens, were quietly whisked from the Al Hawl camp, in mid 2019. The Australian citizens were hooded, so they would not know where they were. They reported that the other Australians were taken to Iraq, where they met with Australian officials, while Duman was detained in an unknown location. There was speculation that she was removed for her own protection as the most devout followers of the ISIS philosophy in the camp disapproved of signs she had abandoned radicalism. In particular, she had stopped covering her head with any kind of scarf, and had taken up smoking cigarettes. She was returned to the camp without any explanation. In December 2019 the Herald-Sun cited Duman as an example, when it quoted an American official who called on US allies, like Australia, to repatriate their citizens instead of stripping them of citizenship. The official argued that stripping citizens of citizenship can backfire, and trigger them to acts of violence. In February 2020 The Australian discussed what was known about the citizenship of Duman's two children, who were born in Daesh controlled Syria. It questioned whether these children, who had Australian grandparents, should be denied Australian citizenship because their mother had been stripped of citizenship. The Guardian reported that Duman and her children were still in the Al Hawl refugee camp, in June 2020. Duman was reported to have mounted a challenge over the legality of the law that stripped her of Australian citizenship.

The village was created in the early nineteenth century as a settlement in the peat colonies. The first residents came from the neighboring part of Germany. Zandberg is therefore one of the Catholic enclaves in the Northern Netherlands. Zandberg owes its name to the sand head, also known as the Schaapsberg, in the green grounds along the stream that was called upstream from Zandberg Valtherdiep and downstream Mussel-Aa. This hill was used to feed sheep and there were possibly huts for the herdsmen of cattle. It was on the border between the Marks Onstwedde and Valthe and was disputed by both. The Semslinie decided this dispute in favor of Valthe. The village gained some fame in 2002 when the Giro d'Italia passed through the village, where an intermediate sprint was held. In 2004 the bond with Italy was strengthened once again when pastor Jaring de Wolff dedicated a memorial mass to Italian cyclist Marco Pantani who died in that year. Officially, the cyclists did not drive through the town of Zandberg in 2002, but through the Zandberg street, located in Ter Apelkanaal, the village next door. A mistake was made at the time and the name Ter Apelkanaal was replaced by Zandberg during the Giro. Zandberg had a stopping point between 1924 and 1935 that lay on the Stadskanaal to Ter Apel railway line. The track has since been demolished, but the station remains intact.
