The attraction offers visitors views from the skyscraper, with two viewing platforms inside the building: the first is a triple level indoor gallery on Level 69, and the second is a partially outdoor gallery on Level 72. The attraction has a ground floor gift shop as well as 'The Sky Boutique,' on Level 68, with limited edition souvenirs. It is the highest shop in London.  Opening  External view from the indoor viewing gallery Mayor of London Boris Johnson officially opened 'The View from The Shard' on Friday 1 February 2013 in a grand ribbon cutting ceremony. Over 5,000 people paid for tickets to be the first to experience the views of London on the launch day, including James Episcou from Epping Forest, Essex who took the chance to be the first to propose to his girlfriend from the highest point in London. Shortly after the opening, The Guardian released an interactive expanded panorama of London to allow users to explore the views from the observation deck online, augmented with ambient sounds of the city.  Journey through the attraction  = Entrance and Level One = The entrance to The View From the Shard is on Joiner Street near London Bridge Station. After entering the lobby and passing through security, there is an opportunity for visitors to have a photograph taken in front of a green screen, onto which a view from The Shard is superimposed, which can be purchased at the end of the experience. Along the walls of the lobby, animated maps and video screens set the historic context of The Shard's London Bridge location. Films and animations also highlight facts about London and The Shard. Graphics show how the building is linked to the city's transport system, showing the lifts moving inside the building and the trains running underneath in real time. = The Lifts System = An innovative lift service system was created for The Shard by KONE engineering. Guests travel in two lifts going up and two lifts going down. These lifts travel at six metres per second, making the total time to go from Level 1 to Level 68 about a minute. The ascending lifts use video screens and mirrors to create the effect of rising through iconic ceilings and roofs of London, including the dome of St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, the Rubens ceiling at the Banqueting House in Whitehall, the spiral staircase at Monument, and the British Museum‚Äôs Great Court glass roof. The descending lifts feature similar effects, using multimedia to create the effect of the sky receding, the seasons changing, and the streets of London coming into focus. = Transfer Zone = Guests transfer lifts on Level 33. They follow an image of the River Thames curving along the floor around which London is geographically mapped in 200 sentences written on the walls and floor, each describing a different part of the city. = The Cloudscape = Guests depart the lifts at Level 68 where the view of the city is obscured with playful cloudscapes. These give the names of the cloud formations that people may see from the viewing decks.The View from the Shard Media Briefing.

The poem, written in the spirit of civil disobedience against the DVD Copy Control Association, argues that \\"code is speech.\\" History and significance DeCSS haiku was created in the context of a series of protests, coming from the international hacker community, against the arrest of Norwegian programmer Jon Lech Johansen, and a series of related lawsuits against him and other hackers (such as Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes and DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. v. Bunner). Johansen, a Norwegian teenage programmer, was one of the creators of the freely distributed DeCSS software which can be used to bypass DVD encryption, preventing even legally-acquired DVDs on running on unauthorized computers (which at that time included all Linux machines). Johansen and others who reposted the code, including the hacker 2600 magazine, were sued by the entertainment industry for revealing a trade secret and facilitating illegal copying and distribution of content on said DVDs. Seth Schoen's goal was to provide tangible proof for the argument that \\"source code is speech\\" and hence should be given the same legal protections as free speech. A number of other activists, in the spirit of civil disobedience, created works of arts containing the infringing code, on the principle that such works are subject to First Amendment principle within the United States.Gabriella Coleman, Code is Speech: Liberalism, Legality, and the Ethics of Free Software Schoen decided to create a poem, which he did in 2001. At first, Schoen released the poem anonymously,Interesting People: IP: DeCSS haiku and more Motion Picture Association threats though he has publicly acknowledged its ownership since.[dvd-discuss] I wrote the DeCSS Haiku The 465-stanza haiku transcodes the DeCSS software, in effect allowing most computer programmers to recreate the DeCSS software from scratch, using the haiku as their only reference. This can be illustrated by the following short excerpt: > All we have to do is this: copy our DKEY into im1, use the rule above that > decrypts a disk key (with im1 and its friend im2 as inputs) -- thus we > decrypt the disk key im1. At another point, the poem discloses a sixteen-digit master key to the CSS code that the entertainment industry lawyers considered a proprietary trade secret: > So this number is, once again, the player key: (trade secret haiku?) Eighty- > one; and then one hundred three -- two times; then two hundred (less three) > two hundred twenty four; and last (of course not least) the humble zero. E. Gabriella Coleman noted: \\"in formally comparing code to poetry in the medium of a poem, Schoen displays a playful form of clever and recursive rhetoric valued among hackers; he also articulates the meaning of the First Amendment and software.\\" David S. Touretzky in turn described this work as \\"ingenious poem... both a commentary on the DeCSS situation and a correct and complete description of the descrambling algorithm. Truly inspired.\\" His work has been described as one of the most notable example of DeCSS-inspired hacker art/code.

Named the ‚ÄúLending Club of China‚Äù, the company was founded in 2012 by Soul Htite, co- founder and former CTO at Lending Club, who joined efforts with Kevin Guo, a PE fund partner and a lawyer from Shanghai to create a company similar to Lending Club in China.  History  In 2012, the co-founder of Lending Club and its former CTO, Soul Htite, came from the United States to China and brought Lending Club's technological know-how with him. He met finance lawyer Kevin Guo, and together they created Dianrong.com.  Overview  As of 2013, Dianrong specialized in small consumer and business loans, ranging in size from 2,500 to 500,000 RMB for personal loans and 50,000 to 2,000,000 RMB for small business loans. Interest rates, loan tenure and fees were based on credit history, income, debt to income ratio, and loan purpose. Tenure varied from 1 month to 24 months, although some 36 month loans had been issued. As of 2014, origination fees varied from 1% to 5%. Personal loans generally had higher origination fees. Interest rates varied from 9.49% to 23.99%. As of 2013, people who wanted to receive loans, and people who wanted to offer loans, could each log into the website, and were obligated to provide certain information. People wanting to offer loans provide information about how much risk they are willing to take and when they want to receive returns, and the software presents loan requestors who fit that profile.  Regulation & risk  As of 2014, pooling and allocating investor funds was unlawful in the PRC. Consequently, online lending platforms had to function strictly as intermediaries between those buying notes and those borrowing money. Violations of these rules appeared to be widespread. In 2013, Dianrong.com's default rate was about 1%.  Dianrong.com and the Chinese P2P industry  The peer-to-peer lending industry in China is very small compared to traditional lending, but is growing rapidly. The market was estimated at $30 million in 2009 and is projected to grow to $7.8 billion by 2015. Industry churn was severe in 2013. More than 70 companies folded or went bankrupt during the year; 58 in the fourth quarter alone. Even with this thinning of the ranks, there are still approximately 1,000 peer-to-peer companies in the Chinese market, \\"80 [to] 90 percent\\" of which \\"might go bust\\". In December 2018, the impact of the market and mainly regulatory changes also affected Dianrong, which led to cash-flow issues resulting in layoffs and office closures. Some employees complained in February 2019 that they have not received salaries for past two months.

The siege triggered an invasion by an Illyrian relief force and ended in the Battle of Medion with an Aetolian defeat. Siege Earlier in 231 BC, after the dissolution of the Epirote League, the Aetolian League had requested the city of Medion to join it, but the Acarnanians refused. The Aetolians decided to take Medion by force, beginning the siege in June. The king of Macedon Demetrius II Aetolicus, a rival of the Aetolian League, being himself engaged against the Dardanians, requested Agron of Illyria to intervene and help the Acarnanians. Agron accepted and sent a fleet of 100 lembi and 5,000 men to Medion. This was the largest force any Illyrian king had ever assembled. The Illyrians and Macedon were not necessarily allied, but the former was instead hired to assault the Aetolians at Medion as mercenaries for the latter. A modern historian, Erich S. Gruen, says that the fact that Demetrius of Macedon had to call the Illyrians to relieve Medion shows that he was incapable of doing so himself. This is supported by another historian, Grainger, who says that Demetrius was preoccupied in northern Macedon in a war against Dardania. As the Illyrians were also at war against the Dardanians, Grainger states it made Agron and Demetrius 'allies'. Polybius, on the other hand, who wrote a contemporary report, simply states that Agron was bribed by Macedon to attack the Aetolians. Polybius possibly wrote this to enforce his previous and later statements that the Illyrians were pirates. Battle The Illyrians landed on the Acarnanian coast in September and marched to Medion to attack the Aetolian besiegers. The Aetolians reacted by sending their own light infantry and cavalry to a higher ground, but a single Illyrian charge, using their close formation and numbers to their advantage, forced the cavalry to retire to the Aetolian hoplites. From their higher ground the Illyrians then charged downwards on the combined Aetolian army, quickly routing them. When at last the Acarnanians from inside the city joined the attack, the Aetolians were defeated and lost many fighters. Aftermath After taking many prisoners and much booty, the Illyrians left Medion and sailed to Illyria. Upon their arrival, they reported their victory over the Aetolians to King Agron, in late 231 BC. He is said to have died shortly afterwards, due to his excessive victory celebrations. He was succeeded by his wife, Queen Teuta, the same year. It is assumed that after the Illyrians defeated the Aetolians at the siege, Medion and the rest of Acarnania allied with Illyria against the Aetolian League to protect the region from future attacks. This is evident as in the naval battle of Paxos, two years later, the Illyrian navy was enforced by ships from Acarnania.

It was an organ of the Iraqi Communist Party. It was printed clandestinely for thirteen years, albeit with interruptions. The first issue of al-Qaidah came out in January 1943. Al-Qaidah was founded in the midst of a split in the party. It was set up by Yusuf Salman Yusuf (Fahd)'s three supporters in the party Central Committee: Daud as-Sayegh, Hussain Muhammad ash-Shabibi and Zaki Muhammad Basim. The newspaper sought to compete with ash-Shararah ('The Spark') for the position as the party organ. Effectively the different factions were known by the names of their publications. As-Sayegh served as editor of al-Qaidah before being expelled from the party. Al-Qaidah was banned by the government, and being caught with an issue of the newspaper could result in a prison sentence. By 1947 al-Qaidah had a circulation of around 3,000. It was probably one of the most widely read newspapers in the country at the time. It was primarily read in Baghdad, the Shiite south and the Kurdish north. During 1954‚Äì55, seventeen issues of al-Qaidah were published. In spite of being an illegal underground publication, its issues had an average circulation of around 5,400. In 1955 a workers newspaper, Ittihad ul-Amal was founded, after which al-Qaidah began focusing more on agrarian issues. Al-Qaidah was shut down as the party reconciled with the Rayat ash-Shaghilah ('Toilers Banner') group, and Ittihad ash-Sha'ab ('People's Union') was founded as the new party organ.

This declaration was made on the urging of the then prime minister, Winston Churchill, who had long regarded the Duke of Edinburgh's uncle, Lord Mountbatten, as a dangerous and subversive rival who had sacrificed India, and did not want to see that name become the royal family's name. In 1959 the Queen announced she was pregnant (with Prince Andrew) and was due to give birth in February 1960. This would be the first child born to the Queen since her 1952 declaration. In September 1959 Edward Iwi wrote to the then Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan and to Buckingham Palace, about the name of the Royal Family. Iwi set out his concern as follows: There was strong reaction to Iwi's letter. The Lord Chancellor Lord Kilmuir told Macmillan: \\"This is in very bad taste. Iwi must be silenced... he might go quietly.\\" Sir George Coldstream, Lord Kilmuir's private secretary, advised 10 Downing Street: Accordingly, Macmillan attempted to rebuff Iwi: But Iwi was not easily put off. He responded to Macmillan on 17 November 1959: (Here he may have had in mind a sermon latterly given by Thomas Bloomer, Bishop of Carlisle which, while not mentioning Iwi by name, seemed to give support to his cause.) There were further exchanges between Macmillan and Iwi, with no resolution, until January 1960, when the Prime Minister was on an official visit to South Africa. Rab Butler reported to Macmillan that at his first audience with the Queen in his capacity as acting prime minister, she had advised him that she had \\"absolutely set her heart\\" on a change to the royal surname.

The church was designed by William White and built from 1872‚Äì74 in a Geometric Middle-pointed, 13th Century Gothic style using yellow bricks with red brick dressings and diapering. Inside, the nave comprises four bays with north aisles, a tower at the south- west corner supporting a wooden belfry and a shingled spire. Concrete piers with naturalistic stone-carved capitals were produced by Harry Hems. The interior floor is tiled. The choir stalls, pulpit and font were built to White's designs. The altar is raised on a stone plinth behind low brass rails. At the east end, the ambulatory descends to the crypt. After a declining congregation and a dilapidated church building, the parish recovered as the result of a church plant in 1987 from Holy Trinity Brompton, led by Pastor Paul Perkin, his wife Christine and a group of about 50 followers. Through donations from the congregation, building works have been undertaken, with a new welcome hall and extended meeting hall opened in 2007. St Mark's Church has been described as conservative and evangelical and was the subject of an article by The Guardian newspaper in 2012, Money becomes new church battleground. The article describes a \\"bitter power struggle within the CofE and the wider Anglican communion\\" on conservative issues such as homosexuality and the ordination of women priests. Boutflower Road, which runs to the east of the church, is named for Henry Boutflower Verdon, the church's first vicar- designate who died, young, in 1879, seven years before the construction of the road as part of Alfred Heaver's St John's Park property development.

The first book in the series, The 100, was published on September 3, 2013, by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers. Day 21, its sequel, was released on September 25, 2014, and Homecoming was released on February 26, 2015. A fourth novel, Rebellion, was released on December 6, 2016. Prior to the publication of the first book, television producer Jason Rothenberg became interested in adapting the story for the screen. The eponymous TV series adaptation premiered on March 19, 2014, on The CW Network, starring Eliza Taylor and Bob Morley as Clarke Griffin and Bellamy Blake, respectively. Plot A boxed set of the four books of The 100. =The 100= The series is set three generations after a thermonuclear apocalypse, wherein the only known survivors of the human race live in a space colony consisting of satellites joined together in orbit around the Earth and governed by The Chancellor, who leads its legislative council. Resources are so scarce that all crimes, no matter how small, are punishable by death, unless the perpetrator is under 18 years of age. The 100 begins with Clarke Griffin, a former medical student, being arrested for a crime committed by her parents: conducting illegal experiments on children under threat of the corrupt Vice Chancellor Rhodes. Clarke confides in her best friend/boyfriend Wells Jaha, The Chancellor's son. Despite swearing secrecy to Clarke, Wells tells his father, hoping to save the Griffins from Rhodes. His plan backfires, the Griffins are arrested, and his relationship with Clarke disintegrates. Two years later, the Colony decides to send 100 of its teenage prisoners to investigate whether or not Earth is habitable. Among the 100 are Clarke, Wells, Octavia Blake, her older brother Bellamy Blake, and Clarke's friend, Thalia. The group crashes somewhere on the East Coast in the former United States. Once there, the 100 struggle to survive in a world very different from the past Earth. Clarke tends to the wounded, and Bellamy gradually develops a romantic interest in her. It is revealed that Octavia had become a drug addict while in prison. A few days later, someone sets fire to the camp, killing Thalia. As the survivors investigate, they discover a farm not too far from the site, leading them to the realization that they are not alone. =The 100: Day 21= Twenty-one days after they land on Earth, the 100 continue to face recurring attacks from an unknown enemy. Octavia has been missing since the fire. Wells tries to maintain morale, while Bellamy tries to find his sister. The 100 find an Earthborn girl, Sasha Walgrove, and hold her hostage. Sasha tells them that they have landed in the former state of Virginia, and that there are people from the Colony who arrived before the 100. Bellamy believes that Sasha's people are responsible for Octavia's disappearance and demands that Sasha reveal their location. Wells and Sasha bond, and Sasha helps Wells find food for the surviving colonists. In space, the people of the Colony fight to get into their drop ships as the space station's life support begins to fail; Clarke and Wells' friends, Glass and Luke, are among the people desperately trying to get to Earth. However, they find themselves at the mercy of Vice Chancellor Rhodes, who is willing to kill to get into one of the dropships. Sasha leads Clarke and Bellamy to a colony beneath the ruins of Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center. There, they meet her father, Max Walgrove, who is the leader of the colony. Octavia is at Mount Weather, having been rescued by Max and his people from a group of renegades. These renegades are responsible for the attacks on the 100. Max and his people promise that they will continue helping the 100, and will provide further support once the rest of the Colony arrives. At this point, they find dropships from the Colony falling from the sky. Wells eventually realizes that there is something familiar about Bellamy and Octavia; ultimately, he discovers that their mother was Melinda Blake, the woman his father had loved before marrying Wells' mother for the sake of his career. This discovery leads Wells and Bellamy to realize that they are paternal half-brothers. =The 100: Homecoming= After the dropships crash, Clarke, Bellamy, and Wells lead a rescue party to the crash site, allowing Clarke and Wells to reunite with Glass and Luke. Clarke ponders leaving the camp to search for her parents. The Chancellor, still in a coma, remains trapped in the Colony above Earth. Vice Chancellor Rhodes takes control over the community on Earth, planning to force Luke to execute Bellamy, as a warning to anyone attempting to challenge him. With Sasha's help, Clarke and Wells escape with the wounded Bellamy. In addition, Glass and Luke flee the camp to escape Vice Chancellor Rhodes. One of Rhodes' men kills Sasha when she tries to get more supplies. Rhodes plans to attack Mount Weather to recapture Bellamy, Clarke, and Wells. As Mount Weather prepares for Rhodes' attack, some of the Colonists revolt and join their benefactors against Rhodes. Clarke, Bellamy, and Wells are captured during the initial exchange, but another faction of Earthborns defeat and capture Rhodes before he can execute Bellamy. Later, more colonists from other dropships arrive, and one of the arrivals informs Wells that his father was still in a coma, with only a few hours of oxygen left when their dropship departed. Before Sasha's funeral, Clarke reunites with her parents at Mount Weather. She reconciles with Wells but will not resume their past relationship because she is romantically involved with Bellamy. =The 100: Rebellion= A fourth novel, Rebellion, was released on December 6, 2016. A month after the previous novel, Bellamy begins showing signs of what Clarke thinks is paranoia when he obsesses over small details in the woods. However, a group of self-proclaimed \\"Protectors\\" infiltrates their camp and abducts several of its inhabitants, including Wells, Glass and Octavia. As Clarke and Bellamy organize a rescue team to take their new enemy down, their relationship is put to the ultimate test when Bellamy doesn't think Clarke trusts him. Eventually, the rescue team and prisoners are able to take the Protectors down as a team effort and in the aftermath, Clarke and Bellamy make up and with her parents' blessing, he asks her to marry him. Reception Publisher Weekly commented that Morgan's flair for the dramatic in The 100 \\"can be forced, but it's easy to be drawn in\\". In addition, Booklist calls The 100 \\"dark and riveting\\", blending \\"science fiction, romance, and characters' shadow sides with a mostly engrossing plotline. The 100 reached #13 on The New York Times' Young Adult Best Seller List. Kirkus Reviews commented Day 21 is \\"faster paced than\\" its predecessor.

The film is Geetu's feature film debut with the film; she had previously made the short film, Kelkkunndo, in 2008, which received wide acclaim. Liar's Dice had its world premiere at the Mumbai Film Festival in October 2013, where it took part in the Indian competition section. In January 2014, the film was screened at the Sundance Film Festival and the International Film Festival Rotterdam. It won a special jury award at Sofia International Film Festival. Liar's Dice went on to receive two National Film Awards at the 61st National Film Awards : Best Actress, for Geetanjali Thapa, and Best Cinematography, for Rajeev Ravi. The film was India's Official Entry for the Best Foreign Language Film for the 87th Academy Awards, but was not nominated. Art Director Ajay Sharma who had worked in movies such as Happy Journey (2014) won the Best Art Director Award at Maharashtra State Film Awards. Plot The canvas of the film stretches from a small village on the mountains called Chitkul, which borders China, to the industrial land of big dreams, Delhi. Kamala, a young mother from a tribal community, her three-year-old daughter, and her daughter's pet goat embark on a journey to find her husband who has been missing for last 5 months. Along the way, they meet an army deserter, Nawazuddin, who accompanies them. They travel together for a while and she and her daughter are lost so he decides to help them. Kamala faints and Nawazuddin helps her. Nawazuddin is attracted to her but Kamala is on her guard. Nawazuddin then helps them get on the bus and trains and also pays for Kamala's goat but Kamala has to pay him for that. Kamala finally reaches her husband's boss' house and meets with the boss' wife and she finds out that the boss is away and suspects that the wife is hiding something from her. She immediately tries to cut ties with Nawazuddin and pays him less than what he had asked for. Nawazuddin gets angry and he follows her, slaps her and scolds her for what she did. Both then meet again in the train station. She decides to go Delhi to search for her husband. Nawazuddin decides to accompany them in order to keep them safe. He convinces them and asks for a lesser amount from them this time. As they arrive in Delhi they try to rent a room, the Hotel manager is suspicious and greedy so he only gives them room for one day. He asks them to vacate. Nawazuddin tries to ask for one with 2 room but he is denied. The hotel manager further suspects the relationship between them as Nawazuddin and Kamala don't appear as a normal husband and wife. Sleeps downstairs and tells Kamala that he will search for her husband's whereabouts and goes in search of her husband. A whole day passes and the hotel management is forced to evacuate Kamala and they take the goat as a collateral saying the money was insufficient. Nawazuddin then comes late and realizes that hotel management has chased Kamala out of the room and taken her goat. So he fights with the management before fleeing from them. He desperately searches for them and he finally during the night finds her with her daughter. He then hugs her as she looks tired, exhausted and depressed about the situation. She breaks free from him and they move to another place. Nawazuddin then again tell her that he has to look for her and goes out leaving his bag. Kamala calls to her husband's phone and this time she finally gets a ringtone however she hears the ringtone from Nawazuddin's bag. She opens his bag to find her husband's wallet, his watch and his belongings which indicates that her Husband was dead all along and the company was trying to cover it up. This shows that many companies hire poor people to work in very bad conditions and don't take responsibility for their lives. Later in the film, Nawazuddin works as a constructor, the same job as Kamala's husband and Kamala is back in her village perhaps as we hear her name called out by Manya amidst snow capped houses. This film talks about a sense of futility; anger against the system and also explores the dynamics of a man woman relationship. It‚Äôs a linear narrative travel story with a more alarming backdrop of the socio political conditions of India today. Cast * Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Nawazuddin * Geetanjali Thapa as Kamala * Manya Gupta as Manya * Vikram Bhagra as Hotel Owner * Murari Kumar as Hotel Boy Production Director Geetu Mohandas is a noted actress in Malayalam cinema. She had written the script of the film in 2007, before her debut short Kelkkunndo (Are You Listening) in 2008. However she was unable to get the film financed because of unusual storyline and a relatively unknown cast. Nevertheless, due to the critical success received at the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) for the short film, she managed to get a project development grant of ‚Ç¨10,000 (around Rs.8.45 lakh now) from the IFFR‚Äôs Hubert Bals Fund. The film faced difficulties in raising funds before Alan McAlex and Ajay G. Rai, producers from Jar Pictures stepped in and produced the film. The film is co-produced by Geetu‚Äôs own production company, Unplugged. Alan McAlex, with the experience of line producing small budget independent films such as Frozen (2007), Harud (2011), also helmed the production of the film.

Initially the paper cost 3d, but a change in the newspaper tax in 1797 brought the price up to 6d.; and the circulation dropped, on the paper's own figures, from about 2,700 to the region of 1,800.

Ground was broken for the building in April 1902,\\"The City News\\", Tucson Citizen (April 22, 1902), p. 5. and the first major event reported to be held at the club was a luncheon for the newly appointed territorial governor Alexander Oswald Brodie, on July 22, 1902.\\"Reception to Gov. Brodie\\", Arizona Daily Star (July 22, 1902), p. 8. The club soon developed a reputation for elegance that rivaled that of some of the nation's most exclusive clubs. Occupation and changes of ownership At the time of its opening, three men occupied the house and co-owned it as shareholders, Leo Goldschmidt, Herbert Tenney, and M.P. Freeman.\\"Death Claims Goldschmidt At Age Of 91\\", Tucson Daily Citizen (January 26, 1944), p. 12.

Goldschmidt bought out their shares in 1912, and lived there himself for a time, eventually passing the house along to nieces and nephews. It was still in his possession when he died in 1944.

It is one of the city's \\"top tourist attractions\\". History Popeye I on the River Torrens, 27 September 2015 The original Popeye, a boat holding up to 20 passengers, was built for Gordon Stanley Watts, a Gallipoli veteran, by Harold Lounder in 1935 in one of several workshops which were then dotted along the banks of Torrens Lake. She proved so popular that in 1939 a second boat, Miss Centenary, was purchased, which had previously run cruises at Glenelg. She did not however (according to the local legend) gain the same acceptance with the children, who preferred to \\"wait for Popeye\\", prompting Watts to re-christen her Popeye II. Later, three new jarrah-hulled boats, capable of carrying 40 passengers each, were built at Port Adelaide; they were numbered Popeye 3, Popeye 4 and Popeye 5, running round trips between Elder Park and Adelaide Zoo. Apart from scheduled runs on weekends and holidays during the warmer months, Popeyes were available for private hire, for weddings, children's birthday parties and other events.*, p.21 During the years that he was skipper of Popeye, if there were a large number of children, Watts would call out \\"Anyone's birthday today?\\" If so, the lucky child would be allowed to steer the boat. Amongst the other Popeye skippers were the boatbuilder Harold Lounder and Roland \\"Sunny\\" Grey. In March 1962 Keith Altmann, owner of riverside caf√©, later restaurant, Jolley's Boathouse, took over the Popeye business. In 1982 three new fibreglass launches Popeye I, Popeye II and Popeye III were launched as replacements for the ageing original wooden boats.Altmann et al. 1999, p.22 These boats were launched by then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. After 49 years as the owner, Altmann sold the business to current owners Tony and Lidija Shuman in 2011. He also sold adjacent business Captain Jolley's Paddleboats. The Shumans already owned and operated Elder Park Paddleboats business which operated alongside, as well as a successful bike hire business.  Awards  * In 1988, Popeye was named the winner of the South Australian Tourism Award * In 2011, the business was recognised as the first State Heritage Icon, a list of quintessential companies established through a partnership with the National Trust SA and the Bank of South Australia. Other State icons include the Balfours frog cake, the Hills Hoist, Haigh's Chocolates, and Coopers Brewery. Significant events *In 1938, boys from Prince Alfred College hired Popeye to celebrate their win in the annual \\"Head of the River\\" rowing eight race against St. Peter's College. *In 1942, Popeye was employed as a gunship, when police with a shotgun attempted to rid Torrens Lake of cormorants (possibly the great cormorant), which had become a pest, attacking the lake's population of swans. *In 1947, patients of the Adelaide Children's Hospital spastic centre were treated to a ride in Popeye in recognition of the centre's first birthday. *In 1951, the two Popeyes acted as floating stages for a choral concert performed by four Adelaide choirs under the banner of the S.A. Arts Council for the state's jubilee *In 1953, following a collision between Popeye 5 and a rented rowboat, Antonio Iuliano, a 24-year-old Adelaide man drowned. One of his companions was rescued by Ray Jolley,Ray was a son of Ern Jolley, who before operating the boathouse was a champion cross-country runner, rower and athlete. of Jolley's boathouse, and a third was rescued by Popeye 5. *In early 1958, Elizabeth, the Queen Mother toured the Lake aboard Popeye 5, a spotlight on her while 200,000 voices sang Will Ye No Come Back Again. *In March 1977, Popeye 5 hosted Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip followed by a choir in Popeye 4 during the Queen's thirdPrevious visits by Elizabeth II were in March 1954 and February 1964 (when John Dowie's fountain \\"Three Rivers\\" in Victoria Square was unveiled) official visit to South Australia. *In 1982, the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, officially launched the three new Popeyes as replacements for the wooden boats.

It is known from a single type species, Eocasea martini. Description Life reconstruction of Eocasea martini Skull Eocasea is the oldest and most basal member of Caseidae, lacking many of the specialized anatomical features that characterize later members of the group. Caseids are notable for being one of the first groups of tetrapods to evolve herbivory; large-bodied taxa such as Casea and Cotylorhynchus have barrel-shaped rib cages and leaf-shaped, serrated teeth that are clear adaptations for breaking down plant cellulose. Eocasea differs from these taxa in having a narrow rib cage, simple cone-shaped teeth, and a much smaller body size. All of these are plesiomorphic features for synapsids, meaning that Eocasea inherited a carnivorous lifestyle from similarly small-bodied carnivorous ancestors of synapsids. As the earliest known caseid, Eocasea represents one of the first transitions from carnivory to herbivory in tetrapods.

An ‚Äúerratic assault/dynamic defence‚Äù is where one or both sides deliberately act without any plan as a means to create a chaotic situation during the battle, thereby overwhelming opponents.Flaherty, C. (2009) 2D Verses 3D Tactical Supremacy in Urban Operations. Journal of Information Warfare. (8)2: 13-24. Some of the key concepts underpinning dynamic defence are \\"deliberate erratic actions\\" and \\"attack zones\\"- the surfaces or spaces vulnerable to attack.  Deliberate erratic actions  In military tactics, the deliberate use of \\"erratic action\\"Ranan D. Kuperman. (2007) Cycles of Violence: The Evolution of the Israeli Decision Regime Governing the Use of Limited Military Force. Lexington Books: 41. forces an opponent subjected to hit-and-run attacks without warning to remain on constant alert and which deliberately wears them down. Examples of erratic tactics used in terrorism are where attacks are opportunistic and targets selected have only a generic relationships with the supposed political aims of the terrorists involved. The value of the attack rests in the confusion and ultimate shock value of the attack when it finally happens. These tactics deliberately present ambiguity and are largely impossible to predict. The advantage of an 'erratic attacks' is that these constitute an omnipresent and/or invisible threat and seemingly occur randomly; there are many potential targets, and one will be chosen randomly and attacked immediately. The purpose of random selection and immediate attack is to avoid encountering any form of prepared defence.  Attack zones  An attack zone is an adaptation of the concept of an attack surface which, in the world of computer security, means ‚Äòthe depth of methods a hacker can use to exploit a system‚Äô.Flaherty, C. (2014) 3D Vulnerability Analysis Solution to the Problem of Military Energy Security and Interposing Tactics. Journal of Information Warfare. URL: http://www.jinfowar.com/3d-vulnerability-analysis-solution-problem-military- energy-security-interposing-tactics/ The concept also has an historical military strategy parallel in the 1921 Turkish defence at the Sakarya River where Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk instructed: ‚Äúyou will no longer have a line of defence, but a surface of defence.... All of Turkey shall be our surface of defence, upon which our units will resist everywhere and all the time‚Äù.Kinross, P. (2001), Atat√ºrk: The Rebirth of a Nation. Phoenix, London, UK. Fundamentally, an 'attack zone' is conceived of as a surface or space and is constituted of the ways in which an adversary can attack a system and potentially cause damage. There are two types of attack: * Avenue of attack: This focuses on a particular objective that is perceived to be tactically/strategically important. This type of attack is typically controlled by ‚Äòforce moderation‚Äô and involves a deliberate process of targeting and selection. * Zone attack: No specific targets are identified other than an attack zone containing a density of potential targets. This situation places an attacker at a tactical advantage because defenders tend to think in terms of deliberate process of targeting and selection. The attackers do not think in terms of specific targets. This tends to result in surprise and confusion among the defenders. In particular, this unpredictability makes interdiction difficult for a defender to implement, for attackers have an innate advantage by deploying in a target rich environment and behaving erratically to achieve surprise and defeat detection using a series of rhizome manoeuvres.  Dynamic or randomized defence  In order to out-compete the erratic moving attacker the defender has two options: * Adopt a denial strategy (akin to concept of sea denial): The defender creates areas under surveillance or fire that become no-go-zones for a would-be attacker. * Harness happenstance and coincidence: The defender begins to move themselves throughout the zone ‚Äì meandering around, in order to create a situation where the attacker cannot be sure where the defender will be next and both combatants run the risk of coming across the other without warning. In this case both forces depend on having a higher state of situational awareness and the high-end military capacity to out-perform the other force when encountered.

Opened in 1866, the line constituted later an element of the Carrara Private Marble railway; after the closure of the latter it remained in service as goods connection until the closure to traffic in 1969. The definitive suppression was established by Decree of the President of the Republic no. 1459 of December 28, 1970.  History  The cargo area of the station Carrara (vintage postcard) The bridge of Anderlino, with two arches, shot down in 1945 The construction of the line began on July 17, 1863, following the decision of the Minister of Public Works, just two months after the inauguration of the station of Avenza. It was officially inaugurated on September 10, 1866, curated by the Societ√† per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia. In 1876, the station of Carrara became passing, with the opening of the railroad Marmifera heading toward the quarries of marble of Colonnata, which exploited the pre- existing connection to transfer the goods to the station of Avenza and, hence, to the port of Carrara. The line was involved in the trafficking of Anderlino bridge with two arches by a bombing in 1945, that destroyed the latter. Following this event the bridges were rebuilt. With the conventions of 1885, the railway line was ceded to the Rete Mediterranea before moving in 1905 to the newly formed Ferrovie dello Stato, which kept it in operation until 1969. The official suppression was established by Decree of the President of the Republic no. 1459, December 28, 1970.  Technical characteristics  4.499 kilometers long, the line branched off from the west side compared to the passenger building of Avenza railway station, later called Carrara-Avenza and, dealt a curve detected and bypassed the Aurelia, it pointed towards the center of the town of marble. The terminus was located at the coeval station of Carrara San Martino, so named for its efforts in this regard by the carrarese general Domenico Cucchiari, renaissance fighter who had distinguished himself at the Battle of San Martino. Along the way there were some booths, one of which is identified in Agricola street no. 121.  Traffic  If the freight traffic was to characterize the line, thanks to the connection of the Marmifera railway and to the freight station of St. Martino which itself acted as a collector for some stone industries, to it was also summed up in the early times of operation, the passengers traffic. The latter in 1933 consisted of 4 pairs of mixed FS trains employing 18 minutes to connect the two locations.

History The show goes back to 1682 when, on the occasion of celebrations in honor of the Virgin Mary, the local dwellers hired a pyrotechnician who, once the spectacle was over, took all his remaining fireworks and shot riding his horse. This extemporized action struck the citizens who began to recall it yearly. In the 18th century a mock steed replaced the animal and the fireworks were assembled upon it. Celebration The Octave of Easter begins with the Mass in the cathedral of Ripatransone, it goes on with the parade of the brotherhoods and it ends with the pyrotechnical show. Around 9.00 pm the mock horse appears in the streets of the town preceded by the marching band and followed by a group of passionate people provided with cowbells and whistles. A huge crowd waits for them in the Matteotti and Condivi squares. After the Horse reached his stage, it runs a pace lap after which the street lighting is turned off. The steed, stuffed with squibs of any kind, runs several laps shooting them on air and among people. The most stunning fireworks have mass denominations such as Baffi (whiskers) which shoot aside and Girella (pinwheel) which constitutes the most important moment of the show. Although sometimes the spectacle can generate panic (especially in not accustomed viewer) and many people are used to be inebriated by the typical red wine of the place, accidents have never happened.

Illyrian Invasion of Epirus and Battle Phoenice had been previously taken by Illyrians acting under Queen Teuta, in 230 BC, after a Gaulish garrison of 800 men surrendered to the larger Illyrian force. In reaction, the Epirote League sent in an army to retake Phoenice. They took up positions at a river outside of Phoenice. Meanwhile, 5,000 Illyrians under Scerdilaidas had advanced inland into Epirus from Southern Illyria and reached a pass just outside Antigoneia. The Epirotes reacted by dividing their army, sending a small detachment to protect Antigoneia whilst keeping their main body outside of Phoenice. The Illyrians at Phoenice, seeing the Epirote army was divided, advanced towards their camp and crossed the river. The next day, the forces engaged each other in battle. The Greek forces were routed and badly defeated, with many being killed or captured, and the remnants of the army fled to Atinania. Further advances, preparation for a second battle, and truce Following the battle, the Epirote league had failed to take control of Phoenice, the most powerful city of Epirus. Scerdilaidas forces had also occupied areas of northern Epirus up until Antigoneia. The Epirotes requested assistance from the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues, with the former having been defeated previously by Illyrians under Agron at Medion in 232 BC. Both leagues sent a combined relief army to the Epirotes which arrived at Helicranum, nearby modern Ioannina, in 230 BC. The Illyrians at Phoenice and those outside Antigoneia under Scerdilaidas joined forces in Epirus and advanced towards Helicranum at the heart of Epirus, preparing to engage the new Greek force in battle. However, they were called back to Illyria by Teuta before the battle begun, following an Illyrian revolt in support of Dardania.... The Dardanian ruler, Longarus, had invaded Illyria, sparking an insurrection.The Illyrians, J. J. Wilkes, 1992, , p. 86, \\"...including the names of Dardanian rulers, Longarus, Bato, Monunius and Etuta, and those on later epitaphs, Epicadus, Scerviaedus, Tuta, Times and Cinna. Other Dardanian names are linked with...\\" Thus, after briefly plundering the Epirote coast, the Illyrians made a truce with the Epirotes and retreated. They also gave up the freemen they had captured at the battle along with the city of Phoenice for a ransom. Afterwards, taking slaves and booty the Illyrians returned to Illyria by sea, whilst the 5,000 under Scerdilaidas retreated northwards to the pass of Antigoneia. Aftermath Following the battle and eventual withdrawal of Illyrian forces, the Epirotes saw that the Greek leagues could not protect them. The Epirote League and Acarnania sent ambassadors to Teuta and entered into an alliance with Illyria against the Achaean and Aetolian leagues.

The district extends from Oak Grove Street in the west to the junction of Baltic Street and United States Route 4 in the east, and includes properties on both sides of the Mascoma River, from Route 4 to the junction of Pillsbury Street and Shaker Hill Road. The village had modest rural beginnings, but began to grow economically with the arrival of the railroad in the mid-19th century, and through the economic activity of the local Shaker community, located on the south side of Lake Mascoma. This resulted in a significant number of Greek Revival and Italianate style houses in the village. The economic power of the Shakers was significant in the village; despite its location outside the village, the Shakers owned or controlled the mills that were the early economic centerpiece of the village. Although a number of mills were built, the major economic activity was eventually consolidate in the Baltic Mills complex, the only major mill complex to survive. These privately owned enterprises resulted in the town's largest period of economic growth, around the turn of the 20th century, when much of the town's commercial center was developed. The village is also home to the town's major civic structures, including c. 1901 Whitney Hall, which houses the town offices and library, the 1852 Unitarian church, and a c. 1907 school, now Enfield Elementary School.Laprey, Kari Ann; Monroe, Lynne Emerson.

During the 10 years he had been living in the US, in Virginia, he lived with a male ‚Äúroommate‚Äù. During his trial it became known that the two were part of a monogamous homosexual relationship. One of the requirements for Naturalization was to prove that you were of good moral character. This fact brought into question for the courts whether Nemetz was in fact of good moral character. The first trial was with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia who denied Therefore, Nemetz admitting to the relationship with his roommate caused for speculation in illegal activity and being of bad moral character. Original petition for Naturalization Nemetz petitioned for naturalization in 1980 and was at first denied naturalization based being a person of bad moral character. Nemetz admitted to his relationship with his roommate and explained that all of their sexual activities took place within their home. The following is part of the questioning that occurred: :Q: Mr. Nemetz, are you now or have you ever been a homosexual? :A: I‚Äôm now. :Q: Have you ever had sexual relations with your roommate? :A: Well we have a relationship. I like him. :Q: Have you ever had sexual relationships with him? :A: What do you mean sexual relationships? :Q: Intimate relationships. Getting into Sexual aspects. :Q: Either yes or no. :A: Yes. :‚Ä¶ :Q: So what you‚Äôre saying is that your relationship in the United States has been with one individual. Is that correct? :A: Yes. :Q: And no others? :A: That‚Äôs right. Yeah. :Q: And in your lifetime that is the only individual you‚Äôve had a relationship of this type with? Appeals case Nemetz took the appeals case to a higher court, The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, who looked at the case logically by setting aside the possible Sodomy, which was still illegal in Virginia at the time. The previous court felt that even the possibility of Sodomy occurring proved that Nemetz wasn‚Äôt of good character. Nemetz proved that any interaction between himself and his roommate happened in the privacy of their own home and was not a threat to the public. Their conclusion was that since Sodomy was not illegal unanimously across the country there was nothing to hold Nemetz back from achieving naturalization. The reasoning for this was that naturalization requires national law therefore federal law must be used for the case.

During this time, the institution offers only the standard Malaysian curriculum for secondary students ranging from Form 1 to Form 5. The programme ended in 1985. In 1978, the college introduced the University Kebangsaan Malaya Science Matriculation Programme. It ran concurrently with the existing secondary school curriculum. The college then introduced the GCE A-Levels programme in 1985; however, the programme ceased in 1988. From this year through 1992, the college changed its name to Kolej Pengajian Tinggi MARA, or MARA Higher Education College, and was under the administration of Yayasan Pelajaran MARA. It introduced another programme in 1988: the Northern Consortium University Degree Programme.

The main dioxin source has contaminated zinc oxide, which had been used as an animal feed ingredient for pigs. In reaction to the crisis the Chilean government has taken measures for the future to prevent such a crisis from happening again, by adopting regulation based upon European regulations for testing and concentration limits. Identification of Source The Chilean pork crisis started in June 2008, when the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service (NVRQS) of South-Korea found high dioxin concentrations in imported pork from Chile. After being notified by the Korean authorities, the Chilean government started an investigation to try to contain the problem and find the source of contamination. Dioxin tests performed by Canadian laboratory pinpointed the contamination to zinc oxide, which was used as an ingredient for pork feed. The zinc oxide originated from an old rural facility that distributed animal feed. It was found that the contaminated ingredient was supplied by a metallurgic company that sold zinc oxide as a by-product from a smelting process of metal scrap. The smelting was not done under the right procedures (high enough temperature) to prevent dioxins from naturally forming. Furthermore, the ingredient sold as \\"zinc oxide\\" was not pure and was treated to obtain a whiter color, so it could be sold as pure zinc oxide on the market. Also according to Chilean legislation, the sale of this product into the animal supplement industry was an illegal activity. All the by- products of the metallurgic company that were sold as zinc oxide were in effect withheld and detained.

Pingsdorf ware is a high fired earthenware, or proto-stoneware,Crabtree, Pamela, ed., Medieval Archaeology, Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages, 2013, Routledge, , 9781135582982, google books that was produced between the late 9th and 13th century in different pottery centres on the Eastern margin of the Rhineland as well as the Lower Rhine region. Characteristic features of vessels in Pingsdorf ware are a yellow-coloured fine sand-tempered sherd and a red painting. It is archaeologically evident within various Medieval settlements of North Western Europe and thus represents an important chronological marker for the Medieval archaeology. It was a forerunner of the first European stoneware, produced in the same region and exported to much of Europe for the rest of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Places of manufacture Known places of manufacture of Pingsdorf ware and related pottery wares along the promontory beam besides Pingsdorf are various places near Br√ºhl (e.g. Badorf and Walberberg) also Liblar, Wildenrath, Langerwehe and J√ºngersdorf, Meckenheim as well as Urbar. Pingsdorf ware was also produced in Siegburg during its earliest period of production. In this regard, especially for the Lower Rhine Region Brunssum is of importance. Along the promontory beam of the Rhineland low iron clays can be found which are excellent for the production of ceramic vessels. These clay deposits are in connection to the brown coal field of the Rhineland. Despite of the exposures along the promontory beam, these clays are also outcropped on the geological zones of disruption on the Lower Rhine Region. In addition to the availability of appropriate clays, the availability of fuel (forest) as well as the accessibility to trading routes was essential to the development of a successful place of pottery manufacture in the Middle Ages. Typology and Distribution Pingsdorf Ware (12th century), Burg Linn, Krefeld. During the early Middle Ages Badorf Ware was produced within the promontory of the Rhineland. A painted type of Badorf Ware was developed from the originally plain and pale promontory ware which was decorated by using a roller handstamp. This painted Badorf Ware is divided into a group of Hunenschans Ware which is decorated by use of a roller handstamp and partly features a fine-sand temper, and a second group of late Carolingina Ware with red finger stroke painting which still exhibits a chalky surface. The Pingsdorf Ware represents a further development of the painted Badorf Ware which becomes established as an independent group from the late 9th century. It is characterised by a sandpaperlike surface which was achieved by its temper with fine sand. Within this group bellied pots and beakers as well as jugs and early types of stove tiles are prevalent. The early types of Pingsdorf ware vessels still feature a lensoid bottom, which is now stabilised by a wavy foot. Within its nearly 400-years of existence in which Pingsdorf ware was produced, the variety of ceramic types did not experience any considerable change. Until now there are only a few stratified finds which could ascertain a detailed chronology. Nevertheless, in general a development form pale vessels with a smooth surface to more high fired, darker serrated vessels is noticeable, which are displaced by vessels with clearly more carved out external rotational grooves. This change to serrated types was conducted during the late 12th century. Until now a periodic change could not be proven only on foundation of its painting. Red patterns of brush strokes are evident within all periods of Pingsdorf ware. Patterns of grids are by tendency a development of the 12th century onwards.Friedrich 2002, 225f. The red painting is gradually abandoned during the late period on the end of the 12th century.Friedrich 1988, 278ff. Around 1200, shortly before Pingsdorf ware passes out of use, the variety of pottery types experiences an addition by jugs and jars of a cylindric shaped neck. Vessels of the Pingsdorf Ware were traded by the Rhine trade route up to England, Scandinavia and the Netherlands. As a high fired earthenware it was the appropriate transport vessel for goods of the Rineland. On the upstreams of the Rhine, Pingsdorf Ware was less common. Controversially discussed is the classification of an in 1949 found canteen from Zelzate, which was burrowed together with a Carolingian coin hoard.Paul Naster: Trouvailles de monnaies carolingiennes √† Zelzate (1949). In: Revue belge de numismatique et de sigillographie. 96, 1950, 208-224. Within the literature this find is usually referred to be the oldest dated vessel of the Pingsdorf Ware range. By now the canteen of Zelzate is attributed to the painted Carolingian pottery of the Baldorf type.Friedrich 2002, 214. In general, a coin hoard vessel from Wermelskirchen,Lobbedey 1968, 123; Friedrich 2002, 214. dating to 960, is referred to be the oldest vessel of the Pingsdorf Ware with an absolute date. Research history First scientific attention to Pingsdorf Ware was dealt by Constantin Koenen. 1889 Koenen conducted a first systematic excavation on a pottery complex in the courtyard of the Kleins Inn in Br√ºhl-Pingsdorf. Withal, he analysed an 80 m¬≥ sherd store, which comprised approximately a dozen different pottery forms. The publication of this excavation in the Bonner Jahrb√ºcher displays until today the most complete overview of the variety of pottery types of the Pingsdorf Ware.Koenen 1898. In 1927, Franz Rademacher published an approach to a chronology of the medieval pottery that was based on an art historical analysis of the pottery ware. He ascribed the red-painted Pingsdorf Ware into the Carolingian time, whereas he distinguished these from the pottery vessels of the Ottonian Period.Franz Rademacher: Karolingische Keramik am Niederrhein. In: Altes Kunsthandwerk 5, 1927, 173-180. In the 1930s, archaeological analyses on Dutch medieval settlements relativised the art historical approach of Rademacher. Wouter C. Braat was referring to a development of the Pingsdorf Ware in succession of the Hunenschans Ware and assumed a constitution of the Pingsdorf Ware around 900. Furthermore, Braat postulated its expire around 1200.Wouter C. Braat: Funde mittelalterlicher Keramik in Holland und ihre Datierung. In: Bonner Jahrb√ºcher 142, 1937, 157-176. Of further importance for the chronological attribution of the Pingsdorf Ware was the stratigraphy of the stream bed of the systematic excavations conducted at the Viking settlement of Hedeby on the Schlei from 1930 until 1939. Whilst the Badorf Ware is still present on the latest horizons of the find spot, it expires shortly around or after 900 and gets replaced by Pingsdorf Ware, which is archaeologically evident until the 13th century. However, an exact chronology of single types of vessels was not possible on foundation of the material found at Hedeby.H√ºbner 1959, 122‚Äì132. In the aftermath there are various individual publication on different find spots. In 1975 Beckmann published a seriation on the finds from the Aulgasse in Siegburg. However, he only focussed on vessels that were found in a complete condition during the excavation. In 2002, for the first time, Markus Sanke published an overview of the variety of pottery of the Pingsdorf Ware that was independent from the find spot.

It was introduced on February 4, 2014, by Minister of Democratic Reform Pierre Poilievre, was sent to the Senate with amendments on May 12, 2014, and received Royal Assent on June 19, 2014. Bill proposals The Fair Elections Act was announced as implementing 38 recommendations of the Chief Electoral Officer. However, in his testimony to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, the Chief Electoral Officer stated that the bill contains measures that \\"undermine its stated purpose and will not serve Canadians well\\". The government broke the bill into eight broad changes to the Canada Elections Act and other acts and regulations surrounding federal elections in Canada. # It creates a mandatory public registry for political parties that engage in mass-calling, and increases penalties for individuals found guilty of impersonating elections officials or tampering with an election. This is a response to the claims of fraudulent calls being made during the 2011 federal election. # It gives the Commissioner of Canada Elections more freedom and independence in seeking tougher penalties for those found to be interfering with elections. It also prohibits 12 new elections offences. Finally, the Fair Elections Act moves the Commissioner of Canada Elections from reporting to the Chief Electoral Officer to reporting to the Director of Public Prosecutions. # It eliminates the use of vouching and Voter Information Cards as a form of ID. # It gives political parties the right to receive \\"advance rulings and interpretations\\" from Elections Canada within 45 days of making the request. This is to allow political parties to consult with Elections Canada for advice and clarification before they try to implement something. # It bans the use of loans to evade donation limit laws. This is a response to Liberal Party of Canada leadership contenders who, in 2006 for example, received \\"loans\\" from individuals that would have exceeded the donation limit, but were ruled as legal because the loans would eventually be paid back. However, as of 2014, several leadership contestants still owe money. The bill increases the annual donation limit from $1200 to $1500 per calendar year and raise election spending limits by five percent. The bans against corporate and union donations, as brought in by the Conservative government's Accountability Act in 2006 remain in effect. # It allows a Member of Parliament whose elections results are being contested by the Chief Electoral Officer to remain as a sitting Member of Parliament until that dispute is resolved. # It proposes to repeal the ban on the premature transmission of elections results. The rationale for the ban was that, due to Canada's large geographic size, different time zones would still be voting while others would have already been closed. According to the rationale, a voter in British Columbia could be discouraged from voting if she already knows the election results in Ontario. The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously agreed that such a ban infringes on freedom of expression. # It proposes \\"better customer service\\" by re-focusing the mandate of Elections Canada by requiring that it remains focused on \\"the basics of voting: where, when, and what ID to bring.\\" Another part is adding an extra day of advance polling, giving Canadians a total of four advance polling days - on the tenth, ninth, eighth, and seventh days before Election Day. Public response A March 2014 poll conducted by EKOS Research claimed that Canadians were \\"shrugging off\\" the bill and that it was failing to make an impact outside of the \\"Ottawa bubble.\\" A March 2014 Angus Reid poll found that the less Canadians knew about the bill, the more likely they were to support it. An April 2014 Ipsos Reid poll found that 87 percent of Canadians believe identification and proof of address should have to be presented in order to vote. Of those 87 percent, 52 percent said they did not \\"care if those requirements made voting difficult for some.\\" In response to claims that the Conservatives were using the Fair Elections Act to \\"cheat the system\\", an April 2014 CTV News poll found that 61 percent did not believe this to be the case. An April 2014 Angus Reid poll found that \\"sound does not necessarily equal fury,\\" noting that, despite constant media coverage and Opposition complaints, public opinion had only changed two percentage points, and remained basically neutral between support or opposition for the bill. However, Angus Reid notes that \\"awareness is slowly growing and that opposition among those who are aware of the changes is also growing\\". Of those \\"very familiar\\" with the act, 59% oppose it.http://www.angusreidglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ARG-Elections- Act-April.pdf Elections Canada response In October 2013, Chief Electoral Officer Marc Mayrand established an advisory board to advise him \\"on matters relating to Canada's electoral system, its voting processes, and support for a vigorous democracy that reflects our constitution, deeply held values, and the evolving needs and circumstances of Canadians.\\" With the introduction of the Fair Elections Act, the advisory board, its role, its budget of $439,333, and its expertise were put under scrutiny. The panel includes Sheila Fraser, Ian Binnie, John Manley, Preston Manning, Bob Rae, and Hugh Segal. Criticism On April 16, 2014, Jeffrey Simpson, in writing for the Globe and Mail, claimed the Act demonstrated a \\"them-against-us\\" mentality in the Conservative government fighting against Elections Canada. In doing a \\"pre-study\\" of the Fair Elections Act, the Senate committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended that nine amendments be made to the Act. On April 25, 2014, Minister Poilievre submitted a number of amendments to the Committee in response to criticism of aspects of the bill. The Globe and Mail summarized the elements of the bill generating controversy: Elimination of Vouching Vouching is the practice of allowing a voter with proper identification to vouch for the identity of another individual that lives in the same polling area. This allows for circumstances in which someone may have moved shortly before an election and not yet have identification showing the new address, or people who do not have driver's licenses. Approximately 120,000 voters in the last election used vouching. While there have been issues noted with the record keeping on vouching, there is no record of vouching resulting in someone voting improperly. While some challenged the need for eliminating vouching, the Conservatives pointed out that Elections Canada recognizes 39 types of identification. The amendments to the bill proposed by the Conservatives on April 25 modified this provision to allow a voter with identification to sign a written oath of his or her residence and have that co-signed by another voter with fully proven ID. This process, for example, allows an aboriginal with a status Indian card, which does not list address, to use that ID and sign an oath regarding his or her residency. Exempting fundraising costs related to previous donors The bill exempted from campaign spending limits the costs of fundraising efforts directed at people who had donated $20 or more in the previous five years. This would have allowed parties to spend unlimited funds on soliciting the renewal of support from past supporters. A concern was this would provide additional benefit to the party with the largest current support base, which is currently the Conservatives. The amendments announced by the Conservatives on April 25 removed this provision. Restrictions to communications from the Chief Electoral Officer The bill placed restrictions on what the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) can say publicly, in particular, he would not have been allowed to encourage people to vote ‚Äì only to give technical information on how to vote. The Conservatives argued that it is the job of political parties to get people to vote, but other groups note that broadly encouraging people to participate in voting is a legitimate role of the CEO, particularly in light of declining voter turnout. This provision in the bill would have likely ended Elections Canada supported programs such as Student Vote, an initiative to boost civic literacy in children. The amendments announced by the Conservatives on April 25 were described as removing restrictions on what the CEO can communicate, but not the limitations on funding voter participation programs. Transferring investigative power to the Director of Public Prosecutions The Commissioner of Canada Elections is the top investigative official for possible irregularities in campaigning and carrying out of elections. The bill transfers the Commissioner from reporting to the Chief Electoral Officer to reporting to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The current Commissioner, Yves C√¥t√©, has said the move is \\"not a step in the right direction\\" and that he has a \\"deep concern\\" with proposals to limit what he can say publicly. The current Chief Electoral Officer has warned that this provision needs rules guaranteeing he and the Commissioner can still share information. New restrictions on the amount of political advertising between elections The previous rules restricted to $200,001 the amount any group can spend on political advertising during a political campaign. Under the new Bill, this became the limit on spending in relation to an election, limiting the total spending on political communications in the four to five years between elections. While Democracy Watch noted this restriction is likely to be struck down by a court, it was accused of putting a chill on groups that might otherwise carry out communications before the next election in 2015. Changes to the appointment of poll supervisors The bill requires the central poll supervisor (the person in charge of a particular polling station) to be appointed from a list of individuals provided by the candidate of the party that won that riding in the previous election. Although the bill allows the returning offer to refuse such appointments \\"on reasonable grounds\\" it does not define what qualifies as reasonable grounds. The amendments announced by the Conservatives on April 25 are described as maintaining Elections Canada discretion in appointing central poll supervisors. Supporters and opponents =Supporters= Academics Carleton University public policy professor Ian Lee supported the Fair Elections Act. Elections experts Although he later changed his mind, Jean-Pierre Kingsley, the former Chief Electoral Officer, gave the Fair Elections Act an A minus. He said he would have liked to see tougher fines, but said, overall, it was a \\"good bill.\\" Media members On April 10, 2014, Sun Media columnist Ezra Levant claimed most of the Fair Elections Act was administrative in nature, and that eliminating the use of vouching was perfectly reasonable. On April 13, 2014, Huffington Post Canada columnist J.J. McCullough said he supported the bill and that Chief Electoral Officer Marc Mayrand had a vested interest in defending his organization's mandate, staff, and budget. Conservative members * Costas Menegakis * Steven Fletcher * Gordon O'Connor * Chris Warkentin * Larry Miller * Bob Dechert * Greg Rickford On March 24, 2014, the minister who introduced the bill, Pierre Poilievre, wrote an editorial for The Globe and Mail on why the Fair Elections Act was \\"in fact, fair.\\" On April 15, 2014, Conservative MP James Rajotte said that while he personally supports the Fair Elections Act, he has been getting a lot of feedback from his constituents, \\"including the curtailing of vouching, an expense exemption for calls to donors who've previously donated money to a political party, partisan appointments of polling day officials and the curbing of the ability of Elections Canada to attempt to increase voter turnout.\\" =Opponents= Academics One hundred and sixty professors signed a National Post editorial that stated \\"if passed\\", the Fair Elections Act \\"would damage the institution at the heart of our country's democracy: voting in federal elections.\\" Media members Postmedia News has a total of nine newspapers who are opposed to the Fair Elections Act and calling for a \\"national conversation\\" on what should be implemented. They include: * Ottawa Citizen * Montreal Gazette * Calgary Herald * Vancouver Sun * Edmonton Journal * Saskatoon StarPhoenix The Globe and Mail editorial board wrote a series of five editorials critical of the Act, and called for it to be killed altogether. Political leaders On April 9, 2014, Liberal Party of Canada leader Justin Trudeau said he would repeal the Fair Elections Act if elected Prime Minister. Elections experts Elections Canada Chief Electoral Officer Marc Mayrand came out strongly against the proposed legislation. However, the appropriateness of his comments, and even his right to make critical comments on proposed legislation were challenged by others. Conservative MP Tom Lukiwski accused Mayrand of political activism, and of giving a \\"campaign-style speech\\" to Elections Canada staff in order to stir up dissent and opposition to the bill. Ezra Levant stated that never before has a public servant, whose job is to remain neutral and implement government directives, gone on the offensive in publicly attacking a proposed government policy. Conservative Senator Linda Frum claimed Mayrand was in a conflict of interest by being allowed to run \\"Get out the Vote\\" initiatives in order to increase voter turnout and in having a vested interest in seeing voter turnout rise. The Fair Elections Act provision to re-focus Elections Canada's mandate, was interpreted as an effort to eliminate the Get out the Vote campaigns. Although he was initially in favour of the Fair Elections Act, former Elections Canada CEO Jean-Pierre Kingsley later commented that a subsequent change to the act to abolish the process of vouching \\"will impact very negatively on the values of participation, impartiality and transparency\\" and \\"will directly affect the constitutional right to vote of a significant number of Canadians without justification.\\" Kingsley also disagreed with a provision in the Bill that allows parties to exclude from limits on campaign spending any money spent to raise donations from people who donated $20 or more in the previous five years. He said that this exempted fundraising activity would effectively be advertising and that the exemption would favour larger parties. Democracy Watch, a non-profit organization, is against the Fair Elections Act. It laid out its opposition in the Globe and Mail on April 7, 2014 and also in a news release and submission to the House of Commons committee reviewing the bill on April 8, 2014.  Subsequent developments  Consistent with their promise, the Trudeau Ministry, whom had been elected in the 2015 federal election, unveiled Bill C-33, later replaced by Bill C-76, which would go on to enact the Elections Modernization Act and repeal many provisions of the Fair Elections Act.

He began his Zionist advocacy during the reign of the communists in the Soviet Union, when such activity was illegal, and as a consequence was imprisoned in a Russian gulag for two years. After his released, he emigrated to Israel, there he continued his struggle for the freedom of Soviet Jews. He was a member of the Herut right wing party and was a delegate of the Jewish Agency to Austria.  Early life  Dov Schperling was born in 1937 in Riga, Latvia. His father Samuel (Sasha) was a soldier in the Latvian army and his mother was a housewife. In 1941, his mother fled with Dov from the advancing Nazi forces, to East USSR and his father joined the ranks of the Latvian division of the Red Army to fight against the Nazis. In 1945, after the liberation of Riga they returned and reunited with his father. His mother and his father, who worked in commerce, and Dov lived with three families of relatives in a two-room apartment. In 1950 his father died of a heart attack.  Politics in the Soviet Union  In 1955 he first heard the sounds of Israeli anthem (\\"The Hope\\") during a football match between the Israeli and Soviet Union teams, and although he did not know the anthem, hearing it for the first time gave him a strong sense of identity. In 1956, when he was a student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in Riga, he heard about the Israeli military operation \\"Operation Kadesh\\" during the Suez crisis. The description of the operation and events in Israel brought to his attention the power and capabilities of the State of Israel. This affected him greatly; he began to be an active Zionist and the Land of Israel became the center of his world. Dov began to distribute material about the land of Israel and the Jewish people to Jews of his age. Schperling was imprisoned for two years in the camp, where he met other dissidents, including Joseph Schneider, David Chavkin, Alec (Elhanan) Feldman, maintaining contact with them throughout his life. In the camp, his connection with Judaism and the Zionist ideal grew and he began studying Hebrew. When he returned to Riga in 1959, he became a prominent figure in the Zionist underground in the city. Along with other idealists like him, he copied Zionist writings, including \\"Exodus\\" and distributed the material to many areas of the USSR.  Emigration to Israel  After the Six-Day War, Soviet authorities wanted to get rid of \\"problematic\\" Zionist activists and as a consequence, Dov immigrated to Israel in 1968. After he immigrated to Israel, Dov continued to fight for the right of Soviet Jewish immigration, even when the methods of this struggle were not accepted by the Israeli establishment. Dov rallied the Israeli University Students Association to his struggle, organized rallies, met with key figures across the country and used the media and other means to enable the immigration of Russian Jews to Israel.  Political activism  Dov Schperling addressing students during a rally in Jerusalem for the Freedom of Soviet Jews During the late 1960s and early 1970s he traveled to different cities in the world to hold demonstrations, often unconventional, and campaigns for freedom of emigration-Aliyah to Israel. In 1970, he flew to New York, along with the fellow immigration activist Jacob Kedmi (Yasha Kazakov), who went on to become the head of the Nativ organization. There they had a nine-day hunger strike in front of the United Nations. The strike made waves in Israel and around the world, during which Kedmi devised the slogan \\"Let my people go\\", that became a symbol of the struggle for Jewish immigration. In 1971, Schperling was one of eight former Soviet Jews who cabled American Jewish leaders protesting their denunciations of the Jewish Defense League and calling the League's activities \\"most effective.\\" He claimed that a recent cancellation of the Bolshoi Ballet's scheduled American tour was forced by the Jewish Defense League and hailed it as the first public surrender by Soviet authorities to Jewish pressure. Over the years, Dov was active in the Herut [Israeli right wing] Central Committee. In 1979 he joined the Department of Soviet Union Immigration of the Jewish Agency. Later on, Dov was the head of the Jewish Agency for Israel delegation in Vienna,http://www.csmonitor.com/1988/0929/oemi.html|\\"Dov Schperling\\" and the head of the Jewish agency travel department. Dov Schperling with prime minister Menahem Begin and IDF commander in chief Ariel Sharon  Family and heritage  In 1973 Dov Schperling married Ella Clear and had their daughter Rachel and their sons Schmuel and Yair. After retiring from the Jewish Agency, he received an award from the Keren Hayesod foundation for his struggle for Soviet Jewry, was interviewed by the Israeli Kneset channel, and appeared in a television event in honor of Geulah Cohen. Dov Schperling died from cancer in 2014. A memorial event was held in the Jabotinsky Institute, hosted by the head of the institute, Yossi Achimeir. Schperling was mourned by Silva Zalmanson, Jacov Kedmi, Geulah Cohen (who due to her medical condition sent a letter that was read in the event), friends and his sons Schmuel and Yair.

Life and career Keith Waller was born in Melbourne in 1914. He was educated at Scotch College and the University of Melbourne. Waller joined the Commonwealth Public Service in 1936, in the Department of External Affairs. In 1937 he was appointed Private Secretary to Billy Hughes, then Minister for External Affairs. His career proved to be long and successful, establishing himself as a successful diplomat across a number of postings, including to Moscow, Washington and Bangkok. In 1943 whilst senior officer to the Australian Legation at Chungking, Waller married Alison Dent in Bombay, India. Waller was Australian Consul-General in Manila from 1948 to 1950. During this time he dealt with the fall-out of the Lorenzo Gamboa case, which saw a Filipino man separated from his wife and children due to the White Australia policy.

The station site today is used as a run-around loop for trains on the heritage Churnet Valley Railway with plans to reopen a station on the site. Construction and opening The station was on the NSR branch from Leekbrook Junction to . The single line branch was authorised on 1 March 1899 by the Leek, Caldon Low, and Hartington Light Railways Order, 1898. and construction took several years. The station at Ipstones was just before the summit of the line, which was also the highest point on the NSR, at above sea level. Station layout The station had a single platform and limited goods facilities. A passing loop was installed and Ipstones was a block section with and Caldon Junction signalboxes. In NSR days the station staff comprised a Station Master, 1 porter and 2 porter/signalman. Closure The branch line was never a financial success and passenger services were withdrawn on 30 September 1935. The station remained open as a goods station until May 1964 when all traffic on the branch except mineral worksings from Caldon Low quarries was withdrawn.  The site today  Mineral trains to Caldon Low continued until 1989 when the line was mothballed. The station buildings had been demolished although the station house still stands. In 2009 Moorland and City Railways purchased the line with the intention of reopening the line to mineral traffic from the quarry. In 2014 this plan was placed on hold as the Competition Commission ruled that Lafarge Tarmac must sell one of its sites, possibly Caldon Low, so the heritage railway the Churnet Valley Railway are seeking to purchase the line. The Churnet Valley Railway ran the first services to Caldon Lowe in 2010 and reopened the loop at Ipstones in February 2014.

It was originally built as the owner's residence on a 727-acre antebellum plantation, and is still owned and occupied by the descendants of the builder. Location Lansdowne is located on M.L. King, Jr. Road, one mile north of the Natchez city limits (The driveway into the plantation is now known as Marshall Road). History The name \\"Geo Marshall\\" on this map just above and to the right of the city of Natchez - between the name Balfour and a Pond along the road - is where Lansdowne is located. The Marshalls also owned Wilderness Plantation, which is where the word \\"Pond\\" is on the map just to the north of the name \\"Geo Marshall\\" Portrait of George Matthews Marshall, ca. 1855, by Louis Joseph Bahin George Matthews Marshall, a Princeton University graduate, and his new bride Charlotte Hunt built the mansion on 727 acres previously known as the 'Ivy Tract' in 1852-1853, having been given the land by Charlotte's rich, planter, father David Hunt (1779-1861).Caroline Seebohm, Enshrining the Old South, The New York Times, February 10, 1991Official website: HistoryHelen Kerr Kempe, The Pelican Guide to Old Homes of Mississippi: Natchez and the South, Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican Publishing, 1989, p. 52 The plantation was named after the couple's English friend, the Marquess of Lansdowne, probably because it made them feel like English landed gentry. Lansdowne adjoined Homewood Plantation, which belonged to Charlotte's sister Catherine. Before the American Civil War of 1861-1865, Lansdowne Plantation's cash crop was cotton.Caroline Seebohm and Peter Woloszynski, Under Live Oaks, Clarkson Potter: New York, 2002, pp 144 - 157 The plantation was 727 acres in size. Not being one of David Hunt's biggest plantations, he gave Charlotte and George another plantation across the Mississippi River in Louisiana as well. Their Louisiana Plantation was Arcola in Tensas Parish near the Mississippi River town of Waterproof. George Marshall had twenty-two enslaved Africans on Lansdowne; and his Louisiana plantation, valued at $119,000, had 104 enslaved Africans. In 1860 his Louisiana and Mississippi property was valued at $319,000. This did not include much of his earned and inherited assets. His father was Levin R. Marshall, a Natchez millionaire planter who owned 1,058 enslaved Africans just before the Civil War. Levin R. Marshall lived at the suburban Natchez estate known as Richmond.Historic Resources Inventory: Richmond Portraits of Levin R. Marshall and George M. Marshall, painted by Louis Joseph Bahin, hang in the dining-room at Lansdowne.Official website: Tour George Marshall fought in the Civil War. He was wounded at the Battle of Shiloh, returned home, and paid someone else to fight on in his place. During the War on January 8, 1865, eleven Union soldiers broke into Lansdowne to rob the Marshalls. They did not get much because the butler, Robert, had hidden the Marshall's silver under the floor of the mansion. In frustration the soldiers took a few pieces of the Marshall's fine china and smashed it along the road as they left. Without the enslaved African labor from before the war, the Marshall's wealth began to decline. Generally, Charlotte and her siblings used Cincinnati, Ohio real estate, inherited from her father David, mortgages on their plantations, and whatever else they had to support themselves after the war. At times the Marshall descendants only had the small income from the sale of butter and eggs from their farming operation to keep them going. Beginning in 1932, charging tourists for tours of the antebellum Natchez planters' homes during the annual Pilgrimage tours brought in much needed money to keep the homes going. A cotton plantation scene from the movie Show Boat (1951 film) was filmed on Lansdowne Plantation. During the 1950s the Marshall descendants sold off the last of their cotton lands. Lansdowne has been added to the National Register of Historic Places since July 24, 1978. In 1995 Devereaux Nobles and her brother George Marshall IV - both great- grandchildren of George Marshal I - owned Lansdowne. The mansion and 120 acres still belong to the Marshall descendants. Architecture Lansdowne, by Frances Benjamin Johnston, 1938 The mansion, built ca. 1853, was designed in the Georgian Revival architectural style. The exterior of the mansion is deceiving, given the scale of the rooms within. It has high ceilings, and a 65 foot long center hall. The great size of the hall gives it a more extravagant feel than is found in many of the larger Natchez mansions. When entering from the front door into the center hall, to the south of the center hall are three bedrooms. To the north of the center hall are the drawing room, dining room and butler's pantry. A stairwell in the butler's pantry leads to storage rooms in the attic and basement. The attic is finished off nicely with gaslight fixtures. The basement had wine and dairy cellars. Due to the impending Civil War, the Marshalls finished the mansion quickly, leaving off the planned second floor. Because of this, the planned library became the middle bedroom instead. Two dependency structures flank the rear courtyard behind the house. During antebellum times, the north dependency housed the kitchen, wash room, and servant's rooms, while the south dependency housed the billiard room, office, schoolroom and governess's room. The north dependency building at Lansdowne Plantation in 1938. This building was originally built as a kitchen and wash room on the ground floor and house servants' quarters on the top floor. When servants were no longer needed, the rooms were converted to living space for the property owners. The mansion is important because it contains most of its lavish original interiors and furnishings with many items having been imported from Europe.Lansdowne, Spring Pilgrimage 2013 - a special publication of The Natchez Democtat, North Canal Street, Natchez, MS The front parlor contains one of the most complete and well preserved Rococo Revival style interiors in Mississipp from the mid 1800s. The home contains rare Zuber & Cie wallpaper, rosewood and mahogany furniture, and Egyptian marble mantelpieces. The rosewood parlor set and Zuber & Cie wallpaper were purchased by George Marshall I on a trip to France. Various cypress base boards are painted to resemble oak and marble. The bronze chandeliers used to be powered by gas made in the plantation's gas works. To keep the house livable, in the early 1900s a bathroom was added on the south end of the rear porch. Electricity was added in the 1940s. In 1962 a kitchen was installed in the butler's pantry and a second bathroom was added to one corner of a bedroom. This was done with as little damage to the original interiors as possible. Outside, the grounds span 140 acres, including Spanish moss, streams, and woodland.

The collection was published by Delacorte/Seymour Lawrence. Content =\\"Wedding Picture\\"= The story begins with the narrator looking at his/her mother's wedding picture. The narrator notices details about his/her mother and also the man in the picture which could be his/her father. The narrator then alludes to the death of the man in the wedding picture and about the loss of religion. The picture was taken in the 1940s, so the mother seems to have been pressured to remarry shortly after the death of her first husband. Phillips writes in a dark tone that leads the reader to believe that the lives of the mother and the narrator were not easy and did not go as planned. The narrator does not seem to resent the mother, so it seems that the mother has done the best she can with the circumstances of her life. =\\"Home\\"= =\\"Blind Girls\\"= =\\"Lechery\\"= A fourteen-year-old prostitute reflects upon her past. She recalls Uncle Wumpy, a man who bought her from Minnie, her then-foster parent who made her work at a luncheonette. The narrator has threesomes with Wumpy and Kitty, Wumpy's drug-addict partner, though Wumpy refuses to have sex with the narrator. The narrator reveals that Wumpy is the one who introduced her to prostitution. Sometimes the narrator fantasizes about Natalie, an eight-year-old girl she met while in foster care. She recalls when she and Natalie were playing in a shed when their foster father came in and forced Natalie to perform sexual acts on him. Sometimes the narrator fantasizes about Wumpy. =\\"Mamasita\\"= =\\"Black Tickets\\"= Black Tickets begins with the narrator expressing his desire for Jamaica Delila. He discusses in depth how he watches her and notices that she likes to draw on herself, giving herself ‚Äútattoos.‚Äù The narrator then begins to expand on his working with Raymond in the coffee shop across from where Jamaica works. Following another fantasy of Jamaica, the narrator begins to tell of being in jail and how his father was not existent in his and his mother's lives. The narrator then changes abruptly to a recollection of the time he shared with Jamaica. In remembering his time with her, he also speaks of abuse and death. While telling of the times that his brother, Raymond, got Jamaica's attention, the narrator becomes quite jealous because he always paid attention to her but she preferred that Raymond did not look at her even. Following another flashback to a time where Jamaica told him about how she had wanted to cut her hair and be the boy of the family, the narrator resumes his thought in present-day and how he will be soon headed to a larger jail. He then recalls the last day that he saw Jamaica, when he woke up and her hair was all cut off. =\\"The Powder of the Angels, and I'm Yours\\"= This story begins as a flashback of an experience a girl has with drugs. She is always high on cocaine and it is suggested that she has a mental illness. She lives in a Spanish speaking country with a man named Hernando whom she met while in rehabilitation in California. Hernando, also a drug addict, and the girl get high together and she sends pictures of it to her friends back in the US. While smuggling drugs across the border they stop on a farmer's land after Hernando overdoses. They make a ruckus and the farmer runs out of his/her house and comes after them. The girl tries to escape with Hernando, but the narrator does not elaborate on what ends up happening to the both of them. Then, there is a time jump to the girl's recovery back in the US where she is in a sanitarium where the priests are blessing all of the people in rehabilitation. =\\"Stripper\\"= =\\"El Paso\\"= =\\"Under the Boardwalk\\"= =\\"Sweethearts\\"= =\\"1934\\"= This story depicts a depression era family's struggles with their father, J.T., succumbing to senility. The narrator, J.T.‚Äôs daughter Francie, highlights the background of her father‚Äôs financial downfall and how his failing business causes him to spiral into a hysterical pitfall. He does things such as wandering the streets and calling his daughter ‚ÄòFrank‚Äô. Throughout the story, Francie becomes convinced by her grandmother that she is crazy like her father. Later, J.T. takes Francie out for a car ride and ends up crashing over a cliff. Everyone is still alive after the accident, but Franice continues to believe that she is crazy when she envisions people in houses off in the distance. However, her mother Lacey attempts to alleviate her concerns by showing her there are no people in the house and walking her through the empty homes. The story concludes with J.T. being sent away from the family. =\\"Solo Dance\\"= This story shows a broken relationship between a family. A daughter visits her father while he is in the hospital dying from cancer. The father is divorced from her mother, and it is obvious that this still affects him. The daughter remains by his side and helps with simple duties such as reading him his cards or helping him shave, but they do not share one word. This amplifies the negative emotions the father is feeling about the divorce, how he is still troubled with it, and how it hurts the relationship he has with his daughter. =\\"The Heavenly Animal\\"= =\\"Happy\\"= This story describes a woman's internal battle for her feelings for a male character. It is undetermined if the male character is a lover or the narrator's child. The author creates two possible paths for the narrator's love, but does not specify who she is talking about. The possibility of a child appears when the narrator says, ‚Äúsmall soft hands, a bread of desire rising in her stomach‚Äù. This hypothesis of a child is seen in ‚Äúa bread of desire‚Äù which means new life. The lover aspect appears in the first sentence, ‚ÄúShe knew if she loved him she could make him happy, but she didn‚Äôt‚Äù. The narrator never confirms who the male is and if she will love him. =\\"Stars\\"= =\\"The Patron\\"= A man named James narrates the story, and is a caretaker for an old sick man. He takes care of the man eight hours a day and during that time, the old man is completely dependent on him for all basic needs. The old man is extremely wealthy and used to work as a dance teacher. He was so passionate about dance that he regularly has his old students come and perform for him. Throughout the story the narrator speculates the old mans homosexuality while keeping his own sexuality unconfirmed. When James is not working for the old man he spends a lot time at a nearby bar watching clips from old films. Although he spends much time taking care of the old man, his motives are questionable as he entertains selfish thoughts of stealing from the old man. James risks the health of the old man by manipulating his medications and pocketing a portion of the allotted amounts. In the end the narrator realizes that although the old man has his fortune, he is willing to sacrifice it to not feel alone. =\\"Strangers in the Night\\"= The narrator begins the story by telling the readers that she often thinks about eating and sleeping. This could be taken as her attempt to 'fit in' and feel more 'normal'. She then discusses her love making, which evokes a sense of loneliness, especially when realizing her love making is not love making at all, but meaningless sex with strangers, as the title tells us. Throughout the entire story, Mayne does not write directly, but leaves much of the meaning of the story open to interpretation. This is a second interpretation of the story. The short story begins with a statement that attempts to connect to the reader, and basically all of humanity. Everyone eats and sleeps, therefore the narrator is attempting to come across as normal. However, she feels an unusual connection between sleeping, eating, and sex. In sleep, she feels free and weightless and able to escape reality. In eating, she feels sensual and intimate. In sex, she also feels limitless and liberated, but also as if she is attached or being held down, suggesting that her morals are pulling her down as she has sex with potential strangers. When the narrator tries to explain these things to him (who could be basically anyone, considering the title), he attempts to comfort her but doesn't seem to truly listen to her feelings. She still feels as though she is in a shadow, or not truly present. =\\"Souvenir\\"= This short story portrays the life of a mother and daughter‚Äîthe daughter, Kate, a young graduate student struggling to pay rent and find love, and a middle-aged widowed mother in an empty house. The mother develops a brain tumor the doctors believe to be malignant. However, Kate's brother Robert doesn't wish to tell their mother. Meanwhile, Kate develops symptoms similar to her mother's: headaches, delusions, and confusion. The two struggle together against the brutality and loneliness of life as they care for one another symbiotically. Kate realizes her duty and privilege in caring for her mother as she falls ill, for Kate's mother cared for her in her times of need. The story concludes when the two ride a Ferris wheel together, and Kate's mother assures her that the storm is ‚Äúgoing to pass over‚Äù (198),Phillips, Jayne Anne. \\"Accidents.\\" Black tickets. New York: Delacorte Press/S. Lawrence, 1979. 255-256. Print. symbolizing an attempt at optimism and strength through the circumstances they must face together. =\\"What it Takes to Keep a Young Girl Alive\\"= The short story is about a young girl, Sue, trying to make it on her own. Sue gets a job at an amusement park with many other young kids. All the kids working at the park go through a lot of struggles to keep on working. Things get so difficult that at one point a coworker passes away (commits suicide?). The boys working in the kitchen tally up which girl cries the most throughout the year. This short story gives a tone of sadness and gives an inside glimpse into the darker and grittier side of an amusement park work. =\\"Cheers\\"= A ten-year-old girl visits a sewing woman to have a cheerleading outfit made. As the woman works, the girl observes her unflattering make up and pitiful living conditions. A postcard hung on a wall depicting Florida and a television playing \\"Queen for a Day\\" in the background serve to further amplify the feelings of longing and misfortune present in the story, and stand in contrast with the young girl's naive and relatively carefree perception of the world. =\\"Snow\\"= The story begins in late summer of 1948 in Spenser, South Carolina. Phillips introduces a young girl named Molly watching her blind mother, Laura, dance at a carnival. Laura and her husband Randal met at a school for deaf, dumb, and blind, where he taught her how to read Braille and make love when she was sixteen. Randal lost his sight when he was seven from the measles and diphtheria and often tries to remember the shape of hands and fingers. Laura lost her sight at a young age from a car crash. She remembers the sight of rain and what her face looked like at that age, but mostly sees only blackness now. At eighteen, she became pregnant with Molly and married Randal, who was thirty-eight at the time. Later, they have a son, Callie, who from the beginning of the story, has deteriorating sight. He is given glasses and wears them all the time, but his vision continues to fade. As it does, it seems his nose bleeds frequently and becomes severe enough that he must be taken to the hospital. Throughout the story, snow is used as a symbol to innocently hide what lies beneath it. Laura remembers a time when she made a snow angel, but it was quickly hidden by more snow. Randal tells Molly a story about a garden and when she asks where it is, he tells her it is hidden under snow and can't find it. Although the snow looks beautiful, it also coldly hides death underneath it. =\\"Satisfaction\\"= =\\"Country\\"= =\\"Slave\\"= =\\"Accidents\\"= A woman tells her readers about her life from two perspectives. She has been in an accident that may have caused head trauma, a story in which she uses to lure men in and have sexual relations with them. She also is referring to her sexual encounters as \\"accidents.\\" The difference between her physical injury, or these \\"accidents\\" as representations of her sexual encounters is not clear; however, the narrator's confused tone on the subject and inability to remember certain events contribute to the lack of clarity and promotes her unstable state. She concludes her story saying, \\"I hurt my head again, I hit it on the bed,\\" which hints toward sexual meaning, as well as a real physical injury. =\\"Gemcrack\\"= The narrator of this cryptic tale is a mass murderer mainly interested in targeting females. The story begins with a description of the act of murder from the narrators point of view, and then goes one to recount the murderer's past and consequential source of his obsession‚Äîfrom his childhood spent in an economically depressed mid-1900s Bronx neighborhood to his days spent learning how to operate a variety of powerful weapons with ease in the U.S. military. The reader is treated to Phillips' familiar poetic prose and stream of consciousness narrative in this haunting tale of violent alienation in modern-day America.

Tooth loss implies in loss of several orofacial structures, such as bone tissues, nerves, receptors and muscles and consequently, most orofacial functions are diminished. Destruction of the supporting tissues of the teeth may progress to necrosis (tissue death) of the alveolar bone, which may result in a decrease of the number of teeth. The decrease in the number of teeth of a patient may find his chew‚Äôs ability become significantly less efficient. They may also experience poor speech, pain and dissatisfaction with the appearance, lowering their quality of life. Classification Mobility is graded clinically by applying pressure with the ends of 2 metal instruments (e.g. dental mirrors) and trying to rock a tooth gently in a bucco-lingual direction (towards the tongue and outwards again). Using the fingers is not reliable as they are too compressible and will not detect small increases in movement. The location of the fulcrum may be of interest in dental trauma. Teeth which are mobile about a fulcrum half way along their root likely have a fractured root. Normal, physiologic tooth mobility of about 0.25 mm is present in health. This is because the tooth is not fused to the bones of the jaws, but is connected to the sockets by the periodontal ligament. This slight mobility is to accommodate forces on the teeth during chewing without damaging them. Milk (deciduous) teeth also become looser naturally just before their exfoliation. This is caused by gradual resorption of their roots, stimulated by the developing permanent tooth underneath. Abnormal, pathologic tooth mobility occurs when the attachment of the periodontal ligament to the tooth is reduced (attachment loss, see diagram), or if the periodontal ligament is inflamed. Generally, the degree of mobility is inversely related to the amount of bone and periodontal ligament support left. Grace & Smales Mobility IndexDental Indices. In Marya, CM, editor. A Textbook of Public Health Dentistry. JP Medical Ltd, 2014. page 203 * Grade 0: No apparent mobility * Grade 1: Perceptible mobility <1mm in buccolingual direction * Grade 2: >1mm but <2mm * Grade 3: >2mm or depressibility in the socket Miller Classification * Class 1: < 1 mm(Horizontal) * Class 2: > 1 mm(Horizontal) * Class 3: > 1 mm (Horizontal+vertical mobility) Causes = Pathological = There are a number of pathological diseases or changes that can result in tooth mobility. These include periodontal disease, periapical pathology, osteonecrosis and malignancies. Periodontal disease Periodontal disease is caused by inflammation of the gums and the supporting tissue due to dental plaque. Periodontal disease is commonly caused by a build up of plaque on the teeth which contain specific pathological bacteria. They produce an inflammatory response that has a negative effect on the bone and supporting tissues that hold your teeth in place. One of the effects of periodontal disease is that it causes bone resorption and damage to the supportive tissues. This then results in a loss of structures to hold the teeth firmly in place and they then become mobile. Treatment for periodontal disease can stop the progressive loss of supportive structures but it can not regrow to bone to make teeth stable again.  Periapical pathology  In cases where periapical pathology is present teeth also may have increased mobility. Severe infection at the apex of a tooth can again result in bone loss and this in turn can cause mobility. Depending on the extent of damage the mobility may reduce following endodontic treatment. If the mobility is severe or caused by a combination of reasons then mobility may be permanent.  Osteonecrosis  Osteonecrosis is a condition in which lack of blood supply causes the bone to die off. It mainly presents following radiotherapy to the jaw or as a complication in patients taking specific anti-angiogenic drugs. As a result of this necrosis the patient might experience several symptoms including tooth mobility.  Oral cancer  Oral cancer is a malignant abnormal excessive growth of cells within the oral cavity, which arises from premalignant lesions through a multistep carcinogenesis process. Most oral cancers involve the lips, lateral border of the tongue, floor of the mouth, and the area behind the third molars i.e. the retromolar area. Symptoms of oral cancer can include velvety red patches and white patches, loose teeth and non-healing mouth ulcers. The risk factors of oral cancer may include caries prevalence, oral hygiene status, dental trauma, dental visit, stress, family history of cancer, and body mass index (BMI), etc. Habits such as tobacco chewing/smoking and alcohol are the major causative agents, although human papillomavirus has also recently been implicated as one of them.[5] Note that alcohol itself is not carcinogenic but it potentiates the effects of carcinogens by increasing the permeability of the oral mucosa. Oral cancers have a range of symptoms including red and white patches, ulcer and non-healing sockets. Another symptom that patients might experience is loose teeth with no apparent cause. Loss of attachment: * By far the most common cause is periodontal disease (gum disease). This is painless, slowly progressing loss of bony support around teeth. It is made worse by smoking and the treatment is by improving the oral hygiene above and below the gumline. * Dental abscesses can cause resorption of bone and consequent loss of attachment. Depending on the type of abscess, this loss of attachment may be restored once the abscess is treated, or it may be permanent. *Many other conditions can cause permanent or temporary loss of attachment and increased tooth mobility. Examples include: Langerhans cell histiocytosis.  Parafunctional Habits  Bruxism, which is an abnormal repetitive movement disorder characterised by jaw clenching and tooth grinding, is also a causative factor in the development of dental issues, including tooth mobility. Although it cannot cause periodontium damage in itself, bruxism is known to be able to worsen attachment loss and tooth mobility if periodontal disease is already present. Moreover, the severity of tooth mobility caused by bruxism also varies depending on the teeth grinding pattern and intensity of bruxism. However, the tooth mobility is typically reversible and the tooth returns to normal level of mobility once the bruxism is controlled.  Dental trauma  Dental trauma refers to any traumatic injuries to the dentition and their supporting structures. Common examples include injury to periodontal tissues and crown fractures, especially to the central incisors. These traumas may also be isolated or associated with other facial trauma. Luxation injury and root fractures of teeth can cause sudden increase in mobility after a blow. However, this depends on the type of dental trauma, as clinical findings show some types of trauma may not affect mobility at all. For example, while a subluxation or alveolar fracture would cause increased mobility, an enamel fracture or enamel-dentin fracture would still show normal mobility. = Physiological= Physiological tooth mobility is the tooth movement that occurs when a moderate force is applied to a tooth with an intact periodontium. Causes of tooth mobility other than pathological reasons are listed below: Hormonal Hormones play a vital role in the homeostasis within the periodontal tissues. It has been advocated for a number of years that pregnancy hormones, the oral contraceptive pill and menstruation can alter the host response to invading bacteria, especially within the periodontium, leading to an increase in tooth mobility. This has been presumed to be as a result of the physiological change within the structures surrounding the teeth. In a study conducted by Mishra et al, the link between female sex hormones, particularly in pregnancy, and tooth mobility was confirmed. It was found that the most substantial change in mobility occurred during the final month of gestation. Occlusal trauma Excessive occlusal stresses refer to forces which exceed the limits of tissue adaptation, therefore cause occlusal trauma. Tooth contact may also cause occlusal stress in the following circumstances: parafunction / bruxism, occlusal interferences, dental treatment and periodontal disease. Although occlusal trauma and excessive occlusal forces does not initiate periodontitis or cause loss of connective tissue attachment alone, there are certain cases where occlusal trauma can exacerbate periodontitis. Moreover, pre-existing plaque-induced periodontitis can also cause occlusal trauma to increase the rate of connective tissue loss, which in turn may increase tooth mobility. Primary Tooth Exfoliation When primary teeth are near exfoliation (shedding of primary teeth) there will inevitably be an increase in mobility. Exfoliation usually occurs between the ages of 6 and 13 years. Usually starts with the lower anterior teeth (incisors and canines); however, exfoliation times of the primary dentition can vary. The timing depends on the permanent tooth underneath. Dental treatments A common scenario of dental treatment causing aggravation of tooth mobility, is when a new filling or crown which is a fraction of a millimetre too prominent in the bite, which after a few days causes periodontal pain in that tooth and/or the opposing tooth. Orthodontic treatment can cause increased tooth mobility as well. One of the risks of orthodontic treatment, as a result of inadequate access for cleaning, is gingival inflammation. This is most likely to be seen in patients with fixed appliances. Some loss of connective tissue attachment and alveolar bone loss is normal during a 2-year course of orthodontic treatment. This does not usually cause problems as it is slight and will resolve after treatment, however if oral hygiene is inadequate and the patient has a genetic susceptibility to periodontal disease, the effect can be more severe. Another risk of orthodontic treatment that can lead to an increase in mobility is root resorption. The risk of this is thought to be greater if the following factors are present: * Radiographic evidence of previous root resorption * Roots of short length prior to orthodontic treatment * Previous trauma to the tooth * Iatrogenic: use of excessive forces during orthodontic treatment  Management  The treatment of tooth mobility depends on the aetiology and the grade of mobility. The cause of mobility should be addressed to obtain an optimal treatment outcome. For example, if the tooth mobility is associated with periodontitis, periodontal treatment should be carried out. In the presence of a periapical pathology, treatment options include drainage of abscess, endodontic treatment or extraction. Occlusal adjustment Occlusal adjustment is the process of selectively modifying occlusal surfaces of teeth through grinding to eliminate disharmonious occlusion between upper and lower teeth. Occlusal adjustment is only indicated when mobility is associated with periodontal ligament widening. Occlusal adjustments will be unsuccessful if the mobility is caused by other aetiology such as loss of periodontal support or pathology. Splinting This is the procedure of increasing resistance of tooth to an applied force by fixing it to a neighbouring tooth/ teeth. Splinting should only be done when other aetiologies are addressed, such as periodontal disease or traumatic occlusion, or when treatments are difficult due to the lack of tooth stabilization. splinting allows healing and functions during tissue healing. Main disadvantage of splinting is it makes removal of plaque more difficult, as there will be increased plaque retention at the margins of the splint, which can cause periodontal disease and further loss of periodontal support. A dental splint works by evening out pressure across a patients jaw. A splint can be used to protect teeth from further damage as it creates a physical barrier between lower and upper teeth.In order to treat mobility, teeth can be joined or splinted together in order to distribute biting forces between several teeth rather than the individual mobile tooth. A splint differs from a mouthguard as a mouthguard covers both gums and teeth to prevent injury and absorb shock from falls or blows. = Types of splints = There are various techniques to splint teeth, and they are classified based on several criteria; the material used, location of splinted teeth, flexibility and the longevity of the splint: A) Material * Resin by itself * Resin with flexible arch of nylon or metal wire * Acid-etched resin-bonded splints *Orthodontic brackets with malleable arch * Vestibular arches or bars B) Flexibility: * Flexible * Semi-rigid * Rigid The use of each type is based on the level of tooth mobility. In general, non-rigid immobilisation is preferred as it is passive, atraumatic and flexible which allows a certain degree of movement and thus advocates a functional re-arrangement of the periodontal ligament fibres and reduces the risk of external resorption and ankyloses. However, in terms of a high mobility grade such as when there are cases of bone plate fracture and late replantation, a rigid splint might be needed. Flexible splints are usually made out of composite resin and nylon thread. Semi rigid splints are usually made with composite resin and orthotondic wire/nylon thread. Rigid splints are made with composite and rigid wires or Erinch bars and orthodontic appliances. The variations in these splints that are made out of similar materials are mainly the diameters of the wires and the weight of the threads; more flexible splints are made of wires that are of lesser diameter while more rigid splints are made of wires with a larger diameter, likewise for the threads. In addition, the wires could also be twisted in a mesh like way to make it more rigid. The acid-etched resin bonded splint is a relatively new alternative method to protect teeth from further injury by more stabilising them in a favourable occlusal relationship. The main goal in this technique is to replace the missing teeth and provided maximum conservation for the structure of remaining teeth. The acid-etching provides a mechanical retention for the resin. Splints are classified into 3 groups according to their longevity and purpose: 1\\\\. Temporary * In general, these are the ones that used less than 6 months during the periodontal treatment. *They may or may not require further and different types of splinting. *Extra-coronal splints which are attached to enamel of several teeth * Intra-coronal splints which are placed into a small channel within the tooth and bonded or cemented into place 2\\\\. Provisional: * They may be used for a long yet limited time-scale, whether months or several years for diagnostic purposes. * According to Amterdam and Fox. (Amsterdam M, Fox L. Provisional splinting: Principles and techniques. Dent Clin North Am 1959;4:73-99. ) This is a phase of restoration therapy using tooth dressing coverage and stabilisation of teeth in combination as an immediate and temporary measure. * They are used in borderline cases, where dentist cannot predict a certain final outcome for the periodontal treatment during the preliminary treatment-planning. * They inform the dentist on whether splinting will be beneficial before any comprehensive treatment. * Such examples are; night guards, ligature wires, and composite resin splints. 3\\\\. Permanent: * They are worn indefinitely and may be fixed or removable. *This is to increase functional stability as well as improving aesthetics for the long- term basis. However, they are often placed only after successful achievement of occlusal stability. *Loose teeth are crowned and fused or joined together *Examples of such technique is Pin ledge type of abutment, and the clasped supported partial denture. Final classification is based on the location of the splinted teeth 1.Extra-coronal splints: * which are attached to enamel of several teeth * They used stabilising wire, fibre-optic ribbon or similar stabilisation devices to bond the outside of the teeth like a fixed orthodontic retainer. * Further examples include nigh guard and tooth-bonded plastic. 2.Intra-coronal splints: * The stabilising device is placed into a small chamber within the tooth that are milled by the dentist, and bonded or cemented into place. * This means the splint is less visible, making it more aesthetically acceptable option. * Examples: Inlays, and nylon wires. = Management of occlusal trauma associated with periodontal disease = Occlusal trauma occurs when excessive force is put on teeth. With periodontal disease there can be irreversible trauma to teeth. According to SDCEP guidelines, when teeth has either over erupted or drifted due to periodontal disease, it is recommended to check for fremitus or occlusal interference: 1\\\\. Fremitus test Allows the diagnosis of trauma caused by patient‚Äôs occlusal forces. The index finger is placed on to the buccal/labial surface of the maxillary teeth. Once in maximum intercuspal position, the patient is asked to make lateral and protrusive movements with their jaw. The vibration of the tooth is felt when it is in the maximum intercuspal position. The vibrations are graded as follows: Grade I: slight movement (+) Grade II: Palpable movement (++) Grade III: Movement visible with naked eye (+++) 2\\\\. Occlusal interference When a tooth occludes in an undesirable contact point, it prevents other teeth from achieving the ideal and harmonious contact points. There are 4 types of occlusal interference: 1\\\\. Centric 2\\\\. Working 3\\\\. Non-working 4\\\\. Protrusive Occlusal interference can be managed by removing the premature contact point or through restorative materials.

It is one of the simplest of all mobile robots, both in its function and its construction. As a result of this ease of construction, they have become popular projects at the school science fair level.  Operation  A DIY Bristlebot A bristlebot is a simple, rigid-bodied robot where the lower surface is coated in bristles, like a brush or velvet. The mass of bristles are oriented so that there is an overall inclination to them away from vertical. This is broadly consistent across the robot body, so that it gives a preferred \\"forward\\" direction. The robot is driven by vibrating its body. The action of these vibrations through the mass of bristles is to gradually move the robot, in the preferential direction of the bristles. There is some comparison between the vibration of a bristlebot and the lashing of bacterial flagella. Most bristlebots are electrically driven, making use of modern developments in low-mass motors and batteries. As bristlebots have such crude locomotion, for both efficiency and control, they are not usually considered as appropriate for sophisticated control systems or responsive behaviours. = Vibrobots = A vibrobot is a related robot, but based on the use of springy wire legs, rather than brush bristles. Vibrobots powered by clockwork or elastic motors have a long history, pre-dating the electric bristlebots. They have been a regular theme in the work of Brazilian designer Chico Bicalho.  Construction  Construction of bristlebots became popular in the mid 2000s, as cellphone vibrate motors became available as a low-cost item, either from scrap pagers and cellphones, or directly from their Chinese factories. These form an ideal bristlebot power source as they are both powerful enough and also light enough, even with a battery. The typical home-constructed bristlebot consists of only three functional parts: a toothbrush head, a vibrate motor and a lithium coin cell. Glue, tape or tie-wraps are used to assemble the parts. The toothbrush must be selected and possibly trimmed to give a flat contact surface with most bristles aligned in one direction. Worn toothbrushes are often no use, as their splayed bristles point in every direction. Such a bristlebot may then rotate or oscillate, but without travelling. Some new brushes may have very vertical bristles that do not generate much movement, unless trimmed into a slope. = Group construction = Group construction of bristlebots is a popular science project for children, through schools, Maker Faires and similar. Kits are available to 'simplify' assembly and add decoration, although this is very far from necessary. = Developments = Artbots or drawbots may be constructed by adding pens to a bristlebot, or using a few suitable pens as the bristles themselves. Such robots are used on a large sheet of paper, where they leave behind a drawn trail. This trail indicates the efficiency of the bristlebot, its distance travelled from the start relative to the circuitous distance along its crooked path. Recent toothbrush heads, such as the Oral-B Pulsar, include rubber blades as well as stiff bristles. These make an even better performing bristlebot that is faster in a straight line. Domestic scrubbing brushes, with larger motors, may be used to make larger brushbots with equally simple construction. By separating the drive across two brush heads, a bristlebot may begin to have steering control. Simple robotics with long- established circuitry may then be used to drive each side independently, with two motors. By controlling their relative power with regard to an external stimulus such as light, a robot with simple behaviours such as light-seeking or light avoidance, may be constructed. This idea of creating a controllable, steerable BristleBot can be further extended by using a WiFi enabled micro controller to create a bristlebot that you can drive from a smartphone, or even teach to drive autonomously. In BEAM robotics, a sophisticated bristlebot may begin to resemble a Walker, although these multi-legged robots are usually much more sophisticated, using multiple actuators with independent control.  Commercial bristlebots  The popular Hexbug range of toy robots began with the Hexbug Nano, a bristlebot. Nano V2, a development of the original Nano released in 2013, has three additional flexible spines on their top surface. This gives them the new ability to climb vertically between two suitably spaced plates or tube walls. As the upper spines are only a narrow row, the 'bots are unstable when upside down and so become self-righting. A variety of clear plastic tube habitats are offered with them. These range from a simple vertical tube to demonstrate climbing, through to multi 'bot habitats with multiple horizontal arenas linked by curved climbing tubes in clear plastic. A variety of additional construction set tube parts are available, including twisted tubes and funnels  References  Toy robots Walking robots ","title":"Bristlebot"},{"id":"42515541","text":"Clanculus bathyraphe is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Trochidae, the top snails.H.

Knappogue Castle is known for bottling one of the oldest and rarest known Irish whiskies, Knappogue Castle 1951, a pot still whiskey produced at the now-defunct B. Daly Distillery.  History  In 1966, Mark Edwin Andrews and his wife Lavone¬¥ purchased Knappogue Castle in County Clare. As they renovated the structure, Mark Andrews amassed a collection of rare single malt Irish whiskey, which he privately bottled and named Knappogue Castle 1951 after the historic building. He focused primarily on the whiskeys once produced at the B. Daly Distillery in County Offaly, which ceased whiskey production in 1954.The Irish Whiskey Trail is a free touring and travel guide to Ireland's distilleries, best traditional whiskey pubs, whisky bars and shops The castle was purchased by Shannon Development in 1996, and is now a venue for weddings and banquets.

The attack on Veracruz was a 1683 raid against the port of Veracruz, in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (colonial Mexico). It was led by the Dutch pirates Laurens de Graaf, Nicholas van Hoorn and Michel de Grammont. History On 17 May 1683 the pirates arrived off the coast of Veracruz with a small fleet which included five large vessels, eight smaller vessels and around 1300 pirates. At the head of the fleet sailed two Spanish warships, previously captured by van Hoorn, designed to confuse the townsfolk into thinking the fleet was Spanish.Piracy: The Complete History by Angus Konstam (Osprey Publishing, 2008) While the fleet was anchored offshore, de Graaf and Yankey Willems were landed some distance from the town and waited until early the following morning. While most of the town's militia were sleeping, the men disabled the town's fortifications and allowed van Hoorn and a large force of pirates, who had marched overland, to enter the city and neutralise the remaining defences. The pirates sacked the town and took many hostages including the town's governor.Blood and Silver: A History of Piracy in the Caribbean and Central America by Kris E.

He sat on the extreme right, and was known for his violent attacks on the governments of the Bourbon Restoration. In 1829 he was briefly Minister of the Interior. In 1830 he was made a peer of France a few months before the July Revolution ended his political career. Early years Fran√ßois-R√©gis de La Bourdonnaye was born in La Varenne, Maine-et-Loire, on 19 March 1767. He was from a noble Breton family which participated in the crusades, and of which a branch had settled in Anjou a century before. In 1786 he joined the Austrasia infantry regiment as an officer. In the early days of the French Revolution 1789‚Äì1799 he was a member of the pro-monarchy Chevaliers du poignard (Knights of the dagger) who placed themselves at the service of King Louis XVI. He was arrested at the Tuileries on 28 February 1791 by the National Guard, and after a few days of detention was sent back to his regiment at Brian√ßon. La Bourdonnaye left France to join the army of Cond√© in October 1791, and spent several months in Switzerland after it was dissolved. He returned to France under the Directory and stayed for a short period in Orl√©ans under the name of Guibert. On 23 Fructidor V he married Mlle Volaige de Vaugirauld at Angers. He was forced to temporarily leave France again, and returned to Switzerland in Vend√©miaire VI. He remained there until October 1802, when he returned to live at the Ch√¢teau de M√©sangeau in the Drain commune of the Maine-et-Loire department. First Empire In 1802 La Bourdonnaye was called to the electoral college of the Maine-et-Loire department to represent the canton of Champtoceaux. On 6 Fructidor XI he was appointed to the General Council of Maine-et-Loire by decree. In the year XII he also became a member of the Angers Municipal Council, holding office until 1815. He proposed to the General Council in 1806 to make Napoleon the hereditary ruler, and was twice commissioned by the Municipal Council and General Council to carry to the foot of the throne the \\"tribute of gratitude and admiration of the department\\". In 1807 he ran as a candidate to the legislative body, but was not elected. He was Secretary of the General Council in 1807. He chaired the General Council in 1813 and 1814, and in this role in 1814 requested and received from his colleagues the oath of allegiance to the king. Bourbon Restoration Fran√ßois R√©gis de La Bourdonnaye, comte de La Bret√®che On 22 August 1815 La Bourdonnaye was elected deputy of Maine-et-Loire in the National Assembly. He soon took a position in the extreme right of the royalist party, and became seen as the leader of this group. On 11 November 1815 he presented a proposal to extend the lists of proscribed people to include three categories. The first was those who held important military or civil positions during the Hundred Days in 1815 when Napoleon regained power. The second included generals, corps commanders, garrison commanders and prefects who went over to the usurper, flew his flag or obeyed his orders. The third category included regicides who accepted positions from the usurper, sat in the Chambers or signed the Charter of 1815. The first and second categories should be tried and sentenced to death, while the third should be condemned to civil death. The revenues of all three should be sequestered. The Amnesty Bill tabled by the Duke of Richelieu on 8 December 1815 drew on La Bourdonnaye's proposal but was more lenient, and was accepted. Now known as the \\"category man\\", La Bourdonnaye was reelected on 4 October 1816 despite opposition from the Decazes ministry. He took the opportunity of the debate over the electoral laws to oppose the government. He first challenged the idea that 100,000 voters could represent the whole nation, but rather than propose enfranchising more voters, he proposed less, conjuring a picture of ambitious men using the mob to gain power. He also fought against laws on personal freedom, the press, recruitment and promotion by seniority. He gained the new nickname of the \\"Ajax of the Right\\". His attacks on the Decazes ministry contributed to its overthrow in February 1820. La Bourdonnaye was reelected on 13 November 1820. He continued to battle in the chamber, and joined with the left to attack the second Richelieu ministry, which was forced to resign in December 1821 after several hostile votes. At first he was more satisfied with the Ministry of Joseph de Vill√®le, but later became more hostile. At the opening session of 4 June 1822 the chamber named La Bourdonnaye as their first candidate for president, but the king preferred Auguste Ravez, the runner-up, and La Bourdonnaye had to settle for the vice- presidency. When his friend Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand succeeded Mathieu de Montmorency as Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1823, La Bourdonnaye announced that he was breaking with him. He continued to express extreme right-wing views in the Chamber. He was reelected on 6 March 1824. In 1825 he supported compensation for the √©migr√©s who had left France to avoid the Revolution, saying that despite the cost the bill would see \\"tranquility assured for ever, and all classes of society returned to their state before the Revolution.\\" He was reelected on 24 November 1827. He failed to enter the cabinet of Martignac as Minister of Finance, and failed to be chosen as president of the Chamber, even though he won the most votes in the first poll. At this time his habitual opposition to the government seems to have lessened. When Jules de Polignac formed his ministry in August 1829, he gave La Bourdonnaye the portfolio of the Interior. The appointment was highly controversial, and the liberal press recalled his association with the amnesty laws and the proscriptions, and with the oppression and executions that had followed in the south of France. La Bourdonnaye was unable to accept cabinet discipline, and resigned on 8 November 1829 when Polignac was made president of the council of ministers. He was named Minister of State and member of the Privy Council by a royal decree on 27 January 1830, and was raised to the peerage. The July Revolution of 1830 ended La Bourdonnaye's political career. He retired to his Ch√¢teau de M√©sangeau. He died there, near Drain, Maine-et- Loire, on 28 July 1839.

The statue is currently housed in the apse of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Audience in Sambuca di Sicilia, Italy. On the evening of the third Sunday of May, the statue is carried in procession through the main streets of the historical center of Sambuca di Sicilia, supported on the shoulders of members of the Confraternita Maria SS. della'Udienza (Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Audience).SAMBUCA DI SICILIA - MARIA S.S. DELL'UDIENZA - PROCESSIONE (QUARTIERE COLLEGIO) youtube.com  History  The sculpture depicting the Virgin Mary with the Child Jesus goes back to the early sixteenth century. A wealthy family brought the statue to Sambuca di Sicilia to the area of Cellaro Tower, part of the fortifications of the area. It lay hidden there for many years inside a cavity of oven kitchens of the tower, and was found by a Sambucese farmer in 1575. During that time a plague was raging through Sambuca. The local farmers decided to take the statue and parade it through the neighborhood infirmary, which was the area of the country dedicated to the care of lepers, in the hope that Our Lady would perform a miracle. At that he statue was attributed to healing the leprosy and it became known as Our Lady of the Audience, because she heard the prayers of the sick. A close-up of the statue.  Fest of Our Lady of the Audience  Since the statue was brought to Sambuca in 1575 an annual celebration has been held in honor of Our Lady of the Audience. The statue is removed from the church and hoisted upon the shoulders of members of Confraternita Maria SS. della'Udienza (Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Audience). It passes through the main streets of the historical center and is paraded about around the city. The procession is accompanied by prayers, hymns, and folk music played by the local municipal band, and lasts until the dawn on the following Monday. It ends with a fireworks display. Madonna dell‚ÄôUdenzia is venerated elsewhere in Sicily: in Ciminna at the Church of St. John the Baptist, there is a triptych dating to the 1600s depicting the miracle; in Petralia Soprana, there is a replica statue, and church dedicated to Madonna dell‚ÄôUdenzia.

She has represented Colombia at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London and has won silver in the 800m at two consecutive IPC Athletics World Championships. She won two bronze medals at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. Personal history Arango Buitrago was born in the Antioquia district of Colombia in 1978 to Gustavo and Romelia. The third of eight children, she grew up on the outskirts of the city of Santa Marta Antioquia, and was educated at Marco Fidel Suarez School. She became a nursery school teacher and in 1999 she gave birth to a son, Juan. In 2003, she was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa a degenerative eye disease. The illness progressed and over the following years she lost her sight. Initially she suffered from depression and spent two years where she did not want to leave her home. She broke her depression when she decided to take control of her disability and learn to live with it. Over the next two years she learnt braille and found work in a factory, packing hospital gloves. In her free time she enjoyed swimming, but a chance meeting with running coach Juan \\"Chope\\" Guillermo Rodriguez led her to take up athletics. Career history Arango Buitrago first became involved about a year after being approached by Chope. She first tried out running whilst blind at the Estadio Alfonso Galvis Duque and from there she developed a passion for the sport. In 2011, she was selected for the Colombia national team at the IPC Athletics World Championships. She competed in two events, the 400m and 800m races. In the 400m qualifiers she was placed in the last of the three heats. Although she finished second behind Britain's Tracey Hinton, her time of 1:07.94 was the fastest losing time of the heats and she took the fourth space in the finals. In the final, despite running a season's best of 1:05.88, Arango Buitrago finished outside the medals in fourth place. In the 800m qualifiers she posted a time of 2:31.31 in the second heat to go through in first place setting an area record. She ran a slower time in the final, but it was still enough for her to finish second behind the Czech Republic's Miroslava Sedlackova to collect the silver medal. In 2012 Arango Buitrago, was selected to represent Colombia at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. Unfortunately for her, her favoured 400m and 800m T11 events were not part of that year's schedule and she elected to run in the 1500m T12 event. Running with her guide Jonathan Sanchez Gonzalez, she finished sixth in a time of 5:05.72. The next year Arango Buitrago represented Colombia again, this time at the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships held in Lyon, France. She entered two events, the T11 800m and the T12 1,500m, again guided by Jonathan Sanchez Gonzalez. In the 1,500m she was placed in the first semi-final with three T12 athletes, none of her competitors running with guides. She finished in second place with a season's best time of 5:09.81 and automatically qualified for the final. The only T11 athlete in the final, she finished fourth with a time of 5:07.47, the fastest runner with a guide. The 800m, running in a category T11 race where all the athletes were guided, she finished first in her heat with a time of 2:31.03. In the final Arango Buitrago ran 2:24.85 an area record to finish second behind Italy's Annalisa Minetti to take her second World Championship silver medal.

He has performed with Woody Herman, Les Elgart, Tito Puente, Frank Foster, Buddy Morrow, Billy May, Charlie Persip, Nat Adderley, Lionel Hampton, and Louis Armstrong. While with Hamp's band, some of the highlights were a Ramsey Lewis television special, and a recorded concert at the Smithsonian Institution, where Ron's solos were taped and put into their Archives. Ron was the featured soloist and arranger for performances with Nat Adderley at the world-famous Apollo Theatre, and he also performed at the Paramount Theatre with King Curtis' Big Band. Ron has played shows for hundreds of stars, including Clint Holmes, Rita Moreno, Robert Merrill, Chita Rivera, Rich Little, and Billy Eckstine. In 1974, Ron recorded with John Lennon and Elton John on the album entitled Walls and Bridges. The all-star horn section included Howard Johnson, Frank Vicari, and Steve Madeo. Ron was a featured soloist on the jazz-gospel album Free to Be Free. He also wrote, arranged, and produced his own album, Ronnie April's Positive Energy Volume 1. Ron had his own TV special on WNYC, and was a featured soloist on Broadway's Song of Singapore. Ron's compositions, arrangements, and productions skills can be heard on Angela DeNiro's first CD, Just For the Fun Of It, as well as her second release, Angela DeNiro...Swingin' With Legends, featuring Lionel Hampton, Frank Foster, and Lew Tabackin. Ron and Angela brought the house down at the Five Towns College Jazz Concert in 1998 and 1999. Ron was featured with the Kenny Barron Trio at the 1998 Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival, and was part of the All-Star cast, which included Frank Foster, Frank Wess, Bill Watrous, Jon Faddis, Al Grey, Ray Brown, Marion McPartland, Abbey Lincoln, and Diana Krall. In addition to a full performance schedule, Ron spends much time composing and arranging, both for an instrumental big band album, and for vocalist Angela DeNiro. During the summer of '98, Ron performed extensively with both his Big Band and Quintet, and received a standing ovation from thousands at the Planting Fields Arboretum in New York, where he and Angela DeNiro again appeared as guest artists in concert with Lionel Hampton's Big Band. Ron's solos, and his impeccable \\"note-matching\\" with Angela at finger- breaking tempos during the scatting segments, wowed their audience! In 1998, Ron's production of Angela DeNiro's \\"Swingin' With Legends\\" album, featuring Lionel Hampton, Frank Foster, Lew Tabackin, and Ron's all-star 16 piece big band, received 8 GRAMMY nomination entries, 3 of which were: Producer of the Year, and Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist for Angela DeNiro's \\"Avalon\\" & \\"The Song Is You.\\" On that historic album, Angela DeNiro became the first and only singer to record Midnight Sun with its composer, Lionel Hampton. In January 2001, Ron's band, with Angela DeNiro, was featured on \\"BET-TV\\". The national program, called \\"Jazz Discovery\\", showcased jazz artists in competition, and was judged by a panel of three, which included jazz legend Chick Corea. Angela, with Ron's band, won. Later that year, Ron completed an arranging assignment for vocalist Alex Donner, featuring nine of Ron's arrangements. Alex released the first of a 2-CD set in the spring of 2001. Ron co-hosted a weekly jazz radio show on WSHR, 91.9 FM, New York, with his wife, vocalist Angela DeNiro. Their show, Rush-Hour Rendezvous ran successfully for two years, and featured great jazz and musical conversation. Ron and Angela DeNiro made a cameo appearance on legendary jazz vocalist Mark Murphy's album, entitled \\"Links,\\" released in September 2001 on the High Note Label. In August 2001, Ron performed in an All-Star band for a Charlie Parker Birthday tribute in Harlem, New York. The band featured four alto saxophonists. Playing alongside Ron were Jimmy Zaff, Gerald Hayes, and James Spaulding. The rhythm section featured Danny Mixon on piano, Bob Cunningham on bass, and Andre Strobaer on drums. Ron wrote for Angela DeNiro's third CD, \\"My Shining Hour.\\" One of Ron's compositions, \\"For Phil,\\" is dedicated to Phil Woods, who has been a major source of inspiration to Ron since the mid 60's. Ron's tribute to Phil, performed by Ms. DeNiro, exudes the warmth and love Ron has for the legendary alto saxophonist. This CD was released in August 2005. Angela and Ron were joined on this album by a smokin' rhythm section consisting of Cecilia Coleman on piano, Tim Givens on bass, and Jim Young on drums. Trumpeter Don Sickler and trombonist Scott Whitfield join Ron's alto sax and flute, and strings rounded out two of the cuts on the album, featuring Matt Aprea on violin. In 2007, Ron Aprea and his wife jazz vocalist Angela DeNiro headlined les Nuits du Jazz Festival, in Nantes France, and were featured with the C√¥te Ouest Big Band, under the direction of Jean-Phillipe Vidal. On June 5, 2013 Ron released his own album entitled Ron Aprea Sextet- Remembering Blakey, Ron's tribute to Art Blakey and his Jazz Messengers. Ron's front line on this album is Joe Magnarelli-trpt., Jerry Weldon-tenor, and Ron on alto. The rhythm section is Cecilia Coleman-piano, Tim Givens-bass, and Vince Cherico-drums. The album is a mix of originals and standards. Ron has two of his own originals, Sophia (written for his granddaughter) and For Pete's Sake (written for the late bassist and close friend Pete Chivily.) Although none of the 12 cuts are tunes that Blakey recorded, Ron confesses that in writing for this project Blakey's Jazz Messengers kept popping into his head. Future plans will include Ron's son Matt who is a violinist, and his wife, jazz vocalist Angela DeNiro.

Most of the petunias sold for cultivation in home gardens are this type and belong to this nothospecies. Characteristics Floral arrangement of petunias in Columbus, Ohio Petunia √ó atkinsiana plants were originally produced by hybridisation between P. axillaris (the large white or night-scented petunia) and P. integrifolia (the violet-flowered petunia). P. axillaris bears night-fragrant, buff-white blossoms with long, thin tubes and somewhat flattened openings. The scent molecules emitted by the hybrids are generally similar to those from P. axillaris. Cultivation Petunia seeds germinate in 5 to 15 days. Petunias can tolerate relatively harsh conditions and hot climates. They need at least five hours of sunlight every day. They grow well in low humidity, moist soil. Young plants can be grown from seeds. Petunias should be watered once every two to five days. In drier regions, the plants should be watered daily.Brown, Deborah. ‚ÄúGrowing Petunias‚Äù University of Minnesota Extension Office. University of Minnesota. 2009. Web. 25 June 2009. http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/horticulture/DG1120.html Dead corollas and seed-capsules should be removed to encourage further branching and flowering. Maximum growth occurs in late spring. The application of fertilizers once a month will help to promote quick growth. Petunias may readily be cultivated in tubs, window boxes, hanging baskets and other containers. Categories =Grandiflora= This type of petunia has the largest flowers, up to in diameter. Of all the petunias these have the widest variety of forms and colours but are the most likely to be damaged by heavy rain. There are four types of grandiflora and they are classified by their colours: ‚ÄòDaddy Series‚Äô (shades of pink and purple), ‚ÄòMerlin Blue Morn‚Äô (blue and white), ‚ÄòSupercascade Series‚Äô (many colours) and ‚ÄòUltra Series‚Äô (many colours, including bi-colour).Engebreston, Don., Williamson, Don. Annuals for Minnesota and Wisconsin. Lone Pine Publishing. 2004. Print. =Hedgiflora (spreading)= Hedgifloras or spreading petunias (sometimes called ground- cover) are characterised by their low height (usually about six inches), but they have a large spread (about three to four feet). They will cover a large area, provided they have adequate water and fertilization. ‚ÄòPurple Wave‚Äô was the first introduced cultivar of spreading petunia and grows to a height of . ‚ÄòTidal Wave‚Äô is another spreading type of petunia, but is much taller (between sixteen and twenty-two inches).

Clemson University. September, 2007. Web. July 1, 2009 =Multiflora= Multifloras are half the size of grandifloras, being in diameter. They are not easily damaged in heavy rain and are more sun-tolerant. Multiflora petunia cultivars include: 'Carpet Series \\"(many colours) and 'Madness Series' (many colours). They spread quickly and are ideal for baskets. =Milliflora= Millifloras are the smallest of the petunias, being about across. These are commonly mixed with other plants in containers, along garden beds and edges. Millifloras are available in 'Fantasy Series' (red, purple, pink) and are the easiest to find. 'Supertunia Mini Series' (blue, pink, lilac, purple and white) are also available in the milliflora category. They tolerate harsh weather better when compared with grandifloras and multifloras.

His works are often site-specific installations with traditional Thai cultural influences. Krue-On is an art instructor, an advisor for postgraduate students, and the Associate Dean of the Faculty of Painting, Sculpture and Graphic Arts at Silpakorn University. Krue-On resides and works in the metropolitan area of Bangkok, although his projects and exhibitions frequently take him out of Thailand. Early life and education Krue-On was born in Mae Hong Son, a northwestern Thai province. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at Silpakorn University in 1989, under the supervision of Chalood Nimsamer. Career Krue-On has created a number of solo works, in addition to collaborating with other artists and presenting exhibitions at galleries and institutions. He specializes in site-specific installations, and sometimes works with local communities to produce his works. His pieces are often sculptural, but he also uses video and paintings. His work highlights the virtues of traditional Thai culture, such as rice farming practices, temple paintings, and Buddhist imagery, while blending Western and local techniques of printmaking, drawing, sculpting, and painting. In 2009, Krue-On was the recipient of the Silpathorn Award for the category of visual arts, presented by the Office of Contemporary Art and Culture. In 2016 he won Prudential Eye Lifetime Achievement Award which made in recognition of an artist with an international track record for his or her contributions to the field of Asian contemporary art over the course of a lifetime. In addition to the award, Niru Ratnam, Director of Prudential Eye Programme citing his work as \\"Whilst other successful Asian artists have sited their practice within a global language of contemporary practice, Krue-On continues to work through nuances specific to Asian cultural identity. For this, and for his international success, he is the winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award at the third Prudential Eye Awards.\\"  Selected projects  = Temple, 2000 = \\"Temple\\" was the first solo work by Krue-On, exhibited in a caf√© and gallery, About Art Related Activities (AARA) in Bangkok. In this work, he transformed three different rooms of the gallery area into spaces for meditation, drawing influences from traditional Thai mural painting. The stencils took the forms of traditional Thai (not Buddhist) deities. The designs on the walls were created to fade over time, slowly becoming invisible. The work coincided with an economic crisis in Thailand. The artist created a similar installation, \\"Nang Fa (Angel)\\" in 2007 for the Neue Gallerie in Kassel, Germany. The work also contemporarily showed in other famous art galleries, such as in exhibition \\"Murals\\" at Fundacio Joan Mir√≥ in Barcelona, Spain in 2010 and at Pearl Lam Gallery in Shanghai, China in 2016. = Cloud Nine (Lom lom Lang lang), 2005 = \\"Cloud Nine (Lom lom Lang lang)\\" was installed in the 100 Tonson gallery in Bangkok. The Thai part of the name means \\"empty hope.\\" The project was a two-room installation; one room featured many white porcelain figurines of street dogs with feathery red angelic wings, devouring a banquet. The second room displayed video footage of real puppies in feeding from their mother. The work was installed again in 2012 as part of exhibition \\" Panorama: Recent Art from Contemporary Asia\\" at Singapore Art Museum, Singapore. In 2013 the work was brought to Hong Kong Art Basel by 100Tonson gallery and was well received as one of the selected high-light. = Documenta 12, 2007 Terraced Rice Field Art Project = \\"Terraced Rice Field\\" was created for Documenta 12 outside of the Schloss Wilhelmsh√∂he museum building. With the help of local volunteers, Krue-On created a functioning terraced rice field on the side of the nearby hill. According to the 'Europe Grand Tour of Contemporary Art' an article by Julia Chaplin in on May 28, 2007 New York Times the 'Terraced Rice Field Art Project' was written about as following \\"...The show - 120 artists from the Congo to Australia - takes an outsider's view of the commercial art world. To keep an element of surprise, Documenta does not reveal the list of artists until the final hour. Among the known participants is Sakarin Krue-On from Thailand, who is creating a Southeast Asian terraced rice field on a hillside outside an 18th-century palace as a large-scale earth-art culture clash...\\" 2007 was a time when rice planting was not a popular subject and popular activity to be shown in various occasion as in nowaday. Sakarin came up with the idea of applying the terrace for rice plantation on the hillside at Schloss Wilhelmsh√∂he in Kassel at the first time he went to the city to survey the sites. In a concept background he cited in his original proposal of the project, Sakarin stated that \\".....The site-specific installation Terraced Rice Fields Art Project seeks to create rice fields on the slope leading up to the prestigious Wilhelmsh√∂he Museum in Kassel. It is an effort to create something in an entirely different and unlikely context, and to fuse two completely opposing sets of cultural beliefs concerning both anthropology and sociology. On one hand, the architecturally brilliant and powerful Wilhelmsh√∂he, guardian of historical artefacts; and on the other, Terraced Rice Field, a testimony to man√≠s conquest over his environment and a symbol of growth and co-operation. Although they differ in form, both structures have similar humanitarian attributes; their aim is to protect and nurture mankind. This will be done through agriculture activity, a tradition born from primitive time, a tool to test the co-operation of people. This project will enlist help of the people of Kassel, both locals and foreigners. It is hoped that by working together to create these fields, the idea of ‚Äòself‚Äô and the division of labour in modern society will be put to question. The study of this simple yet effective farming method will also prove that the contemporary social system we live in is not the only way. A system such as farming may look so primitive and disconnected from daily life in Europe that it seems like a romantic notion, but in actual fact farming still continue to be a source of sustenance in countries all over the world. Terraced Rice Fields stresses the importance of the process, and not the end product. I hope that the creative effort of Terraced Rice Fields Art Project will show one possible solution to the problem of sustenance, and reveal the simplicity of co dependence on other human beings, of life as it lived in our early societies. Reflecting on generosity and making an effort to be generous, to meet half way, to be honest and harmonious, is a starting point to proving that a society based on co-operation and support will not be easily abolished. This simpler way of living may then turn out to be what everyone truly desires.\\" Ripe Project : Village and Harvest Time (‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏£‡∏£‡∏Ñ‡πå‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏≤ ‡∏ñ‡∏∂‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏•‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏Å‡πá‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏ß), 2008 The project was a follow up of the Terrace Rice field Art project under the collaboration between the artist and Tang Contemporary Art and ARDEL Gallery of Modern Art and was present through the methods of site- specific installation and multidisciplinary. The project was given an explanation and citing in details accordingly by the curator Josef Ng as in the excerpt below \\"... Yet, rather than to call attention to agricultural spectacle around a localized form of community practice, this project was about empowerment. Informed by co-dependency, informed by an ideal notion of a dialogic space, a temporary field Krue-on wants to establish where people from geographically, culturally and socially disparate spaces come together to express their differences and ideas while allowing communitarian pluralism. Depending not so much on what is actually produced in tangible form vis a vis, the framework that Krue-on has established, certainly creates an entryway where an alternative living methodologies can be considered in addition to engaging the politics and practice of contemporary consumer culture. The process continued with this latest solo exhibition, simultaneously held in 2 venues at the same time and later, in another site as part of a group exhibition. Again, interested in bringing forth how daily activities of life and artistic process work within each other, creating a social dynamics of community-building, Ripe Project: village and harvest time represents a disparate of conceptual pursuits. Categorized as, what the artist termed, ‚Äú3 sub-elements‚Äù, namely, Production, Re-production and Propaganda, each sub-element is presented in a different site, yet, they are connectedly marked by a concern over the everyday and the experiential; an imperative for the artist in this project. In Ardel Gallery of Modern Art lies the essence of ‚ÄúProduction‚Äù, where grown rice brought back from Krue-on's Terraced Rice Field Art Project in Germany, will be re-planted together with new rice seedlings here in Thailand. This will be accompanied by a diaristic chronological timeline, in the form of drawings and diagrams, photography, video and narrated text, of the artist's seeds of cultivation in the project, from site visit to planning to execution in Documenta and finally, right up till now. In Tang Contemporary Art, for the sub-element of ‚ÄúRe-production‚Äù, an installation of ‚Äòminiature‚Äô paintings will be exhibited. Inspired by Thai ancient mural paintings, Krue-on has paid particular attention to the communal activities found in selected murals and ‚Äòre-produce‚Äô them in a series of 12 tempera-based works. Instead of focusing on the big narratives in religious spirituality usually preached in the large compositions of Thai mural paintings, as most are derived from the scriptures of Buddhism, the artist pays more attention to the daily activities of communal living, denouncing the preconception that the idea of the unity between community, labour and sharing represented an anachronistic and dying culture. Instead, he sees this unity as a vibrant, resurgent force to counteract with today's ever-increasing ideology-capitalism. By having the paintings produced in a size no more than 12 by 15 cm, and having them hanged in the spacious gallery under dimmed light condition, with the only spotlight on these works, Krue-on attempts to tease out the audience to move closely to these souvenir-looking pieces to gaze closely at the contents in these artworks. Under such setting, the audience would be able to focus and to re- construct narratives and possibilities, and re-imagine communities. The two venues will also be linked by a web-streaming live broadcast so that one can actually view the contents of what's in the respective galleries in real time when visiting either one of them. The last sub-element, ‚ÄúPropaganda‚Äù, will be the combination of the contents in two venues, and presented in a virtual format in another exhibition, held at the Chulalongkorn University Art Center. What I enjoy in Krue-on's projects is, not only his shrewd playfulness, yet with sensitivity, but his site-specific variations expose the sanctuaries of culture, whether in relation to personal, society or to art. Krue-on certainly works within the mind of true contemporary artists but, in a manner he only knows how, utilizes spaces and times that are simultaneously local and global to enact a unique contemporaneity.\\" Venice Biennale, 2009 Krue-On was one of five artists from Bangkok who worked together to represent Thailand at the Venice Biennale in 2003 and again in 2009. In They changed a pavilion into a satirical version of a tourism office, which appeared to be trying to convince the public to visit Thailand as tourists. The office displayed fictitious news broadcasts, large brightly-colored posters, travel brochures, and interactive video displays. Manorah and Best Friends of the Snake, 2010 An installation of short silent film and art objects showed at 100Tonson Gallery in Bangkok in 2010. The film which was in the artist's specific art project \\"Two men look out through the same bars . One sees the mud and one sees the stars\\", inspired by the folktale reciting a melancholic love story between a mythical maiden and a king of a typical kingdom. The story was told through the practice of silent film with humorous and sarcastic manner. The film was also exhibit as part of exhibition 'Thresholds' at Sandaram Tagore Gallery in New York in the project by the curator Gregory Galligan in 2013. Busan Biennale, 2012 \\"MONUMENT OF AWAKENING ERA\\" Sakarin was invited to participate in Busan Biennale 2012 \\"Garden of Learning\\" with a large installation \\"MONUMENT OF AWAKENING ERA\\" which dozens of forcelain antlers were installed in a large space of the exhibition venue, just as described in the exhibition catalogue \\" In a huge, dark gallery, white antlers ‚Äì a whole flock of them ‚Äì emanate from a blackish liquid covering the entire floor. The artist calls his worka \\"monument\\", but what it is meant to commemorate? The antlers are made of porcelain; they are both fragile and precious. Their image, mirrored in the blackish liquid, only adds to their immaterial, almost ghost-like appearance. This looks more like a landscape of doom, even a graveyard than a monument, and yet this piece holds the secret to an extraordinary beauty.The apparitional look of the antlers forms an afterimage, rendered in three dimensions, of a species that has been extinct since the late 1930s: Schomburgk's Deer. A swamp deer that once roamed the central plains of Thailand (the artist's home country), its antler was characterized by a flat, bushy look. Sakarin Krue-On was once greeted by such an animal at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. He somehow felt drawn to the grace the animal betrayed, even as a padded thing, and a connection between past and present was made (this is, after all, what museums are for). The artist then learned that, much like today's desperate masses of people, the deer had to flee the often flooded plains of Thailand. The animal was forced to move uphill in search of food, leaving it vulnerably exposed to predators. Schomburgk's Deer came to realize much too late that the creatures following him were not fellow deer, but humans ‚Äì hunters wearing antlers for better range and rifle accuracy.The flooded plains, the people, the deer ‚Äì all of these are present and connected in the Monument. And yet, given the history of the animal's extinction, do we have to attribute the porcelain antler to the deer, or could it be the human ‚Äì the hunter in disguise? Indeed, what is being commemorated here might not be Schomburgk's Deer, but a human intelligence that facilitates not only the destruction of the world's riches, but also and ultimately itself\\" Garden of learning /Busan Biennale catalogue/ 2012/ p. 89-92 The \\"MONUMENT OF AWAKENING ERA\\" was moved across from Korea Peninsular to Sanya, a sea beach city of China to be installed in Sanya Art in 2013 Imply-Reply : 2015 Art exhibition of Huang Yong Ping and Sakarin Krue-On. The exhibition consisted of older works and some new works of both artists showing at Bangkok Art and Culture Centre on 11 February - 26 April 2015. On part of Sakarin, the major works he put on show in this exhibition included \\"Yellow Simple\\" a work form his early solo exhibition in 2001 and \\"Remains\\" an installation of a couple vases of flowers on a high antique console, a resonant of the essence of life and time which was part of his solo show \\"h\\" at H gallery, Bangkok in 2008. The exhibition also held his new works, 'Monkey in the House', 'Upside Down' a memorable size of tapestry narrating the story of Tiger hunt, an implication of our moral principle, 'Rat House' a big wooden house inspired by the old day Chinese gambling game. Another important piece was 'To Stand Lonely on the Turtle Head' an installation of Chinese mythological figure setting on a high platform which was another implication on ethic. In 2016, 'Monkey in the House' was exhibit at Saatchi Gallery in London as part of exhibition 'Thailand Eye' . Singapore Biennale 2016 \\"Kra tua Teang Sue/ Tiger Hunt \\" The project was created to perform and exhibit in Singapore Biennale in 2016. As a collaboration between the artist and Wat Khuha Sawan Folk Play Company, a group of actors from Wat Kuhasawan Community, Klong Bangluang, Thonburi, Bangkok. (Wat is Thai word means Buddhist temple), the work aimed to reflect way of life in a megacity in another dimension. Kra- Tua Taeng Seua is a folk amusement inherited from a traditional folk play vastly known in southern Thailand. In the past, it usually was performed to entertain people during the Buddhist ceremony. A story of Kra-Tua Taeng Seua is about a villager name Bongton. He was a hunter. Every day he and his sons would go into the forest to hunt animal. His wife would went along with them, carrying with her a basket to collect wild fruits and vegetables. One day, while they were on their way in the forest, they encountered a tiger. The tiger tried to snatch the basket from the wife so Bongton fought with the tiger to protect her. At last, the tiger was killed. The performance was as simple as other folk plays yet the degree of fun was heighten by performers‚Äô acrobatic action, amusing movement of dance and lively sound of traditional percussion played in accordance with verses, narrating the details of the story. The performance would take place on the playground while the viewers sit around to enjoy the show. Apart from the live performance on the opening occasion, the story of Kra-Tua Taeng Seua was developed into a short film with a script adapted by the staff to emphasis on the faith in humanity. All actors were from Wat Khuha Sawan Folk Play Company. They took part in all the process of the production, from acting coached to costume design, to make it the actual production of their own community. Kra-Tua Taeng Seua was an attempt to confirm their identity and their faith in each others. The Folk play proved itself as a link between the members of Wat Khuha Sawan Folk Play Company's lives and the contemporary way of life instead of being an obstruction that separate them from their own community. The project also included behind the scene documentary. The process of the production will be documented until the making of the short film is finished. All film, documentary and objects such as original masks and costume were installed and show in the atmosphere of the anthropology museum. A TALEBEARER‚ÄôS TALE : The Last Deer - Tang Contemporary Art Bangkok- 2017 \\"A Talebearer‚Äôs Tale: The Last Deer,‚Äù is a solo exhibition for Sakarin Krue-On, it took place from August 16 to September 23, 2017. This exhibition continued creative threads from the artist‚Äôs previous conceptual art, which draws inspiration from traditional Thai culture and reflects the crises and challenges currently facing Thailand within the context of globalization. This solo exhibition, ‚ÄúA Talebearer‚Äôs Tale: The Last Deer,‚Äù serves as an extension of Monument of an Awakening Era, the work that Sakarin Krue-On showed at the 2012 Busan Biennale. The key work in this exhibition, A Talebearer‚Äôs Tale, also begins with the story of the Schomburgk‚Äôs deer. When we walk into the exhibition space, a classic desk sits in the middle, bearing the lifelike head of a Schomburgk‚Äôs deer. On a nearby wall hangs a Thai folk painting from the twentieth century; a video plays on the other side of the hall, showing the artist interviewing people on the street about the legend of the Schomburgk‚Äôs deer. The exhibition also contains a rich array of historical documents, and the overall layout of the show is reminiscent of a display in a natural history museum. Through this exhibition, Sakarin Krue-On attempts to present his thoughts after encountering the world‚Äôs only Schomburgk‚Äôs deer specimen at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. The Schomburgk‚Äôs deer, a species unique to Thailand, is now extinct. In the forests of Kanchanaburi Province in 1932, the last Schomburgk‚Äôs deer fell to a hunter‚Äôs gun. In Samut Sakhon in 1938, a drunkard beat the last recorded Schomburgk‚Äôs deer to death at a local temple. When the artist discovered this unique Schomburgk‚Äôs deer specimen in Paris, he finally realized that the legendary, beautiful animal that he had heard about since childhood actually once existed. ‚ÄúA Talebearer‚Äôs Tale: The Last Deer‚Äù conveys the tragedy of the extinction of this beautiful, legendary species, but the show also explores the greed in human nature, and the irreversible impact people have had on the world and later generations due to a lack of moral restraint and reverence. The artist hopes that viewers will, through the story and extinction of the Schomburgk‚Äôs deer, consider Thailand‚Äôs social transformation, and the country‚Äôs distinctive cultural identity, values, and traditions as it attempts to find balance between the past and the future amidst globalization and economic and social development.

The Archaeological Inventory of County Cork describes it as a (now roofless and without floors) mid to late nineteenth century corn mill, rectangular, four- storey, with a three bay entrance front, and located on the western bank of the Dripsey River. Access to the third floor of the mill was gained from a 'modernized residential house' via a stone platform and cement bridge. A wheel pit housed a cast-iron suspension water wheel with a diameter of 4.9 metres, and inscribed 'J. Steel and Sons, Vulcan Foundry, Cork'. A pinion-wheel, via a pit-wheel within the mill, powered two line shafts, which in turn powered two pairs of French burr millstones on the first floor. A similar gable-ended structure was attached to the mill north wall, with intact roof and floors, but in poor condition. Foundation blocks for machinery remained on the ground floor, but all gearing and machinery had been removed, with a Crossley Engine lying discarded to the north. Clonmoyle Mill is not depicted on the 1841 surveyed OS Map, nor mentioned in Ordnance Survey name books, and would appear to be of later construction. It exists by the mid-nineteenth century, as the Primary Valuation of Ireland (Griffith's Valuation) records a Hamilton as occupier of a 'Flour Mill' in Clonmoyle, with the buildings valued at ¬£34, and the Lessor being Jonathan Bruce. This is the same Jonathan Bruce who was then occupier of nearby Clonmoyle House, leased from Charles Colthurst. On the 1901 surveyed OS Map, it is depicted as 'Clonmoyle Mill (Corn)', with a nearby footbridge, sluice to the Dripsey River and mill race originating to the north near Luskin's Bridge. The Irish Tourist Association survey of 1944 confirms Clonmoyle House as the residence of Mrs Young, who also 'owned nearby Clonmoyle Flour Mills'. A separate survey entry is contained for Clonmoyle Flour Mills, giving the company name of 'John Young and Sons Limited, Clonmoyle, Coachford', which company appears to exist to this day. The survey states that numerous mills were erected around the Great Famine (Ireland) period to meet increased demand for the processing of Indian meal and it was thought Clonmoyle Mill was built for this reason as between 1847 and 1854. The exact year of construction was uncertain, but a grinding stone, said to be a replacement from another mill, bore the date 1856. Clonmoyle Mill was said to have first been operated by 'Charles Colthurst of Ballyvourney' and that methods introduced by him were still followed in 1944, and the mill independently operated, some ninety years later. Wheat was kiln dried in the loft, heated through a perforated floor, and then ground into flour by stone rollers driven from the mill wheel. The older milling method employed was said to be preferred. Oats and barley were also ground for the feeding of cattle, pigs and poultry. Visitors were admitted to the mill, free of charge, but at their own risk. O'Donoghue (1986) refers to 'flour mills' located at the eastern side of Clonmoyle East, which were by then disused. Today, Clonmoyle Mill is in a ruinous condition and its surroundings neglected.

The profession was developed in response to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Diagnostic-Related Group (DRG) system in 1983 and gained greater notice around 2007 with CMS's transition to Medicare-Severity Diagnosis-Related Groups. With the expansion of risk-adjusted value-based payment and quality measures and increasing accountability by regulatory agencies, CDI now impacts at least 20 different models affecting payers, facilities, and providers. CDI professionals act as intermediaries between Inpatient coders who translate diagnoses into data and healthcare providers and nurses. As many clinical coders don't have patient care backgrounds, and healthcare providers might not realize the importance of accurate documentation, the CDI professional serves to make the connection between these two groups. CDI professionals should be familiar with Medicare Severity DRGs (MS-DRG) ICD-9 to ICD-10 coding.

Raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Eckhart learned the millers' trade there as a representative for the Eagle Milling Company. He co- founded his own company in 1874 and saw it prosper. Eckhart was elected to two two-year terms in the Illinois Senate in the 1880s and was director of the Chicago Board of Trade for three years. Later in his career he was president of the Sanitary District of Chicago and an aide-de-camp to Governor Charles S. Deneen. Biography Bernard Albert Eckhart was born in Alsace, France on September 4, 1848. He came with his family to the United States when he was 6 years old, and with his family, settled in Schleisingerville, Wisconsin.

The film tells the story of the deportation to the United States in 1933 of Jimmy Gralton, who led the Revolutionary Workers' Group, a precursor of the Irish Communist Party, in Leitrim. It stars Irish actor Barry Ward, along with Simone Kirby, Jim Norton and Denise Gough. The title refers to a rural dance hall built by Gralton in his home town Effrinagh. It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Plot In 1932, after ten years in the United States, Jimmy Gralton returns to his native Ireland to help his mother run the family farm. A new government is in power in Ireland ten years after the end of the Civil War. To meet the needs of the young people of County Leitrim, Jimmy, in spite of his reluctance to cause upset to his old enemies (the Church and the local landowners), decides to reopen the \\"Hall\\", a young people's centre, free and open to all, where the local young people meet to dance, study or talk. Success comes quickly, but the growing influence of Jimmy and his radical ideas are not to the taste of everyone in the village. The film centres around political tensions between the Catholic church, the state and the republican movement to which Jimmy through his pre-emigration history is connected. Jimmy's political alignment is central to the film, he suffers for being a free-thinker and committed to the liberation of ordinary people through education and also by having experience from America of jazz (the rhythms and passions of \\"darkest Africa\\" are warned against in one church sermon warning of the perils of the \\"Hall\\"). Jimmy is aligned to communism by the communist support and encourage participation in the study and dancing that evolve as key activities at the \\"Hall\\". The power and hypocrisy of the church is demonised in the film by aligning it to the beating by her father of a free spirited young girl who laughs at the priest while she is named and shamed for attending a dance at the Hall in a church service. The pious religion of Jimmy's mother is also contrasted against her love of learning and ability to explore popular non-religious literature, which has aligned her family to Communism for liberation of working people. It is clear throughout the film that Jimmy and his mother are not aligned to any struggle above and beyond the necessities of their local community; however, this does bring them into involvement with attempting to prevent an eviction of a family who are displaced from their home. This eviction and the assertive reinstatement of the family along with Jimmy's support and oratory to those gathered at the reinstatement draw him to the attention of the Garda√≠. This starts a chain of events which ends in Jimmy's expulsion from Ireland based on the flimsy premise that he holds a US passport and that political agitators have previously been expelled from the country on such grounds. The lack of a fair trial is emphatically explained in the film by a speech given by Jimmy's mother at a rally surrounding the expulsion. The behaviour of the state's police is shown and explained to be occurring at a time when Stalin was in full control of the Soviet Union and the state and church are fearful of forces that threaten to destroy them. It is this tension between the ideals of Christianity and the fear of the church and its natural tendency to be reactionary that is the central issue that the film explores. Critical response Jimmy's Hall garnered generally positive critical reception. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 76% from 103 reviews. Another review aggregator, Metacritic, assigned the film a weighted average score of 63/100, based on 24 reviews from mainstream critics.

A friend and political associate of U.S. Senator Huey P. Long, Shushan was an important political figure in Louisiana during the 1920s and 1930s, before scandals drove him from public office. Early life and career Shushan was born in Bougere (now part of Reserve), Louisiana. He was first employed during his early teens by Shushan Brothers, a New Orleans wholesale dry goods business established by his father and uncle. Shushan became a partner in the firm in 1916 and president of the firm in 1931. Political career Shushan became involved in Louisiana politics as a supporter in the political machine of Huey Long. Long was criticized by Gerald L. K. Smith, a racist and anti-semitic politician, of having \\"too many Jews\\" in circle, which \\"Shushan resented.\\" After Long was assassinated, Shushan and his allies had Smith fired and his Share Our Wealth program eliminated. Appointed to the New Orleans Levee Board in 1920 by Governor John M. Parker, he was reappointed by successive administrations and became president of the Board in 1929. He was a member of the Levee Board during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. Shushan was involved in fundraising for John H.

His role in the Long machine ended due to the tax evasion scandal, despite his acquittal. The scandal was cited by scholar Zephyr Teachout as one of the most notorious corruption scandals in American history. He ended up being sued by Louisiana Attorney General on behalf of the Levee Board, and the case reached the Louisiana Supreme Court in 1940.

The French region known as Upper Brittany is the traditional homeland of galette-saucisse, especially the department of Ille-et-Vilaine and some parts of its bordering departments like C√¥tes-d'Armor, Morbihan, Loire-Atlantique, Mayenne and Manche. First created during the 19th century, the dish consists of two landmark food items of the cuisine of Brittany. Buckwheat, introduced in Brittany during the 15th century and largely cultivated in the region, is the main ingredient of Breton galette and was a common substitute of bread in poor families. Pork sausage is one of the food specialties of the Rennes area. Galette-saucisse is very popular in Upper Brittany, especially at outdoor public events, outdoor markets and sports games. It is strongly associated with the Stade Rennais F.C. football team, the dish being often eaten at the Route de Lorient Stadium during soccer games.  Description  = Recipe = The essential ingredients of the galette-saucisse are: * a type of crepe called galette de sarrasin made from buckwheat flour, a cuisine landmark of Upper Brittany * a cooked pork sausage composed, as some specialists recommend, of 75 to 80% of pork meat and 20 to 25% of pork fat. The pork sausage can be salted and black pepper was traditionally used for the recipe. The crepe itself is usually served cold, in order to protect eater's hand from the hot cooked sausage, but it can be warm when crepes are freshly prepared as consumers are arriving. = Dressing and toppings = There is a strong opinion among Brittany people about the toppings and dressing that you can add to a galette-saucisse. The canonical recipe of the galette-saucisse does not include any dressing, and the \\"French Association for the Preservation of the Galette-saucisse\\" recommends to not add any of them. Author of Galette-saucisse, je t'aime ! book Benjamin Keltz wrote that ketchup, mayonnaise and any other dressing are strongly seen as unacceptable. However, there was a time when black pepper was traditionally added to the recipe and some people do consider today that Dijon mustard is acceptable. There is the same opinion about toppings. Sausage was historically just one of other items to be included in the galette. At the beginning of the 19th century, it was common that galette-saucisse was topped with caramelized yellow onions, a variety of dry onion traditionally produced in the French department of Manche.

R. Davis The Colored Conventions Movement, or Negro Convention Movement, was a series of national, regional, and state conventions held irregularly during the decades preceding and following the American Civil War. The delegates who attended these conventions consisted of both free and fugitive African Americans including religious leaders, businessmen, politicians, writers, publishers, and abolitionists. The conventions provided \\"an organizational structure through which black men could maintain a distinct black leadership and pursue black abolitionist goals.\\" The minutes from these conventions show that Antebellum African-Americans sought justice beyond the emancipation of their enslaved countrymen: they also organized to discuss issues concerning labor, healthcare, temperance and educational equality. Although the conventions largely subsided following the Civil War, the Colored Conventions of antebellum America are seen as the precursors to larger African American organizations, including the Colored National Labor Union, the Niagara Movement, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. History In the early 19th century, national and local conventions involving a variety of political and social issues were pursued by increasing numbers of Americans. In 1830 and 1831, political parties held their first national nominating conventions. Historian Howard H. Bell notes that the convention movement grew out of a trend toward greater self-expression among African Americans and was largely fostered by the appearance of newspapers such as Freedom's Journal, and was first suggested by Hezekiah Grice. The first documented convention was held at Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church in Philadelphia in September 1830. Delegates to this convention discussed the prospect of emigrating to Canada to find refuge from the harsh fugitive slave laws and legal discrimination under which they lived. The first convention elected as president Richard Allen, founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the first independent black denomination in the United States. The idea of buying land in Canada quickly gave way to addressing problems they faced at home, such as education and labor rights. Philadelphia was the hub of the Colored Conventions movement for several years before nearby cities such as New York City, Albany, and Pittsburgh also started hosting conventions. By the 1850s, the conventions were extremely popular and multiple national, state, and local conventions were held every year. Although the majority of these conventions were held in northern, particularly New England states, conventions are documented as taking place in Kansas, Louisiana, and California. The conventions attracted the most prominent African-American leaders from across the country, including Frederick Douglass, Charles Bennett Ray, Lewis Hayden, Charles Lenox Remond, Mary Ann Shadd, and William Still. Following the Civil War, colored conventions began to appear in the Southern states as well, with one author noting that \\"we can not deny that the various conventions of the colored people in the late insurrectionary States compare favorably with those of their white brethren...their reasolutions are of an elevated humanity and common sense to which those of the other Conventions make no pretension.\\" The post-war conventions culminated with the 1869 National Convention of Colored Men in Washington, D.C. The convention delegates wrote a letter congratulating General Ulysses S. Grant for being elected President of the United States, to which Grant responded, \\"I thank the Convention, of which you are the representative, for the confidence they have expressed, and I hope sincerely that the colored people of the Nation may receive every protection which the laws give to them. They shall have my efforts to secure such protection.\\" List of conventions * 1830 convention at Mother Bethel A.M.E.

Legacy As national, state, and local colored conventions began to decline, other national organizations popped up. In response to a denial of African American admittance to the National Labor Union, community leaders and others formed the Colored National Labor Union (CNLU) in December 1869. Former Colored Convention delegates Isaac Myers and Frederick Douglass were instrumental in organizing the CNLU. The last known colored convention took place in Indianapolis in 1887. The convention movement slowed by the end of the century, and it re-emerged in the early twentieth century as the NAACP, founded in 1909. In the interim, T. Thomas Fortune's National Afro-American League was formed in 1890 and held national and state-level meetings throughout the 1890s. From 1896 to 1914, W. E. B. Du Bois held an annual conference at Atlanta University of national importance. In 1898, bishop Alexander Walters founded the National Afro-American Council, which met annually until 1907 and with Fortune and Booker T. Washington playing prominent roles. In 1905, Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter met near Niagara Falls, Canada, founding the Niagara Movement. Du Bois' continued activism and relationships forged at these meetings led to the foundation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People by Moorfield Storey, Mary White Ovington and Du Bois.

Recalls In August 2007, Gilchrist & Soames conducted a voluntary worldwide recall, in cooperation with the FDA, of its toothpaste with the company name on it. Gilchrist & Soames recalled its toothpaste, made by Ming Fai Enterprises International Co Ltd, after the FDA issued its warning that tests showed the toothpaste contained diethylene glycol, a chemical used to thicken antifreeze that can cause liver damage. On December 18, 2014, in cooperation with an enforcement action of the FDA, Gilchrist & Soames initiated a worldwide recall of numerous lots of several different products in its lines, including certain conditioning shampoos, mineral baths, shower gels and body washes. According to the FDA, all the products \\"may be contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter gergoviae,\\" potentially dangerous bacteria. Gilchrist & Soames said that all recipients were notified of the recall of the dangerous products and they were able to recall up to 75 percent of the products distributed. On December 7, 2015, in cooperation with another enforcement action of the FDA, Gilchrist & Soames initiated a worldwide voluntary Class II recall of a wide range of different products due to microbial contaminations. The forty-four different products included shampoos, body washes, body lotions, mineral baths, and numerous other types of products, amounting to more than two million items. They included Gilchrist & Soames pseudo-brands, such as Spa Therapy, Verde, and BeeKind, and they also included custom products produced for such hospitality properties as Gaylord Hotels and Hyatt.

Chemical shift referencing is a problem in protein nuclear magnetic resonance as >20% of reported NMR chemical shift assignments appear to be improperly referenced. For certain nuclei (especially 13C and 15N) these referencing issues can cause systematic chemical shift errors of between 1.0 and 2.5 ppm. Chemical shift errors of this magnitude often make it very difficult to compare NMR chemical shift assignments between proteins. It also makes it very hard to structurally interpret chemical shifts (i.e. identify secondary structures or perform chemical shift refinement). Unlike most other chemical shift re-referencing tools PANAV employs a structure-independent protocol. That is, with PANAV there is no need to know the structure of the protein in advance of correcting any chemical shift referencing errors. This makes PANAV particularly useful for NMR studies involving novel or newly assigned proteins, where the structure has yet to be determined. Indeed, this scenario represents the vast majority of assignment cases in biomolecular NMR. PANAV uses residue-specific and secondary structure-specific chemical shift distributions that were calculated over short (3-6 residue) fragments of correctly referenced proteins (found in RefDB) to identify mis-assigned resonances. More specifically, PANAV compares the initial (i.e. observed) chemical shift assignments to the expected chemical shifts based on their local sequence and expected/predicted secondary structure. In this way, PANAV is able to identify and re-reference mis-referenced chemical shift assignments. PANAV can also identify potentially mis-assigned resonances as well. PANAV has been extensively tested and compared against a large number of existing re-referencing or mis-assignment detection programs (most of which are structure-based).

Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors include a spectrum of tumors from the low-grade typical pulmonary carcinoid tumor and intermediate-grade atypical pulmonary carcinoid tumor to the high- grade pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and pulmonary small cell carcinoma (SCLC), with significant clinical, epidemiologic and genetic differences.  Types  Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor are classified according to tumoral grade: * Low grade pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor: Typical pulmonary carcinoid tumour (TC; low-grade); * Intermediate-grade pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor: Atypical pulmonary carcinoid tumour (AC; intermediate-grade) * High-grade pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor ** Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) ** Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC of the lung) Low-grade nodular neuroendocrine proliferations ‚â• 0.5 cm are classified as carcinoid tumors and smaller ones are called pulmonary tumorlets. When neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and tumorlets are extensive, they represent the rare preinvasive lesion for carcinoids known as \\"diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia\\". Both LCNEC and SCLC can demonstrate histologic heterogeneity with other major histologic types of lung carcinoma, such as pulmonary adenocarcinoma or pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma, but is not characteristic of TC or AC.  Risk factor  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1)can be found in carcinoid tumor patients, but not those with LCNEC and SCLC.  Genetics  Genetic changes are very high in SCLC and LCNEC, but usually low for TC, intermediate for AC.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of SCLC, TC and AC can be made by light microscopy without the need for special tests in most cases, but for LCNEC it is required to demonstrate NE differentiation by immunohistochemistry or electron microscopy.

Hubbard (1900-1961), the author of several books on the continent and its wildlife, spent several months in 1929-1930 in Rhodesia with his family (wife and two children) and cameraman W. Earle Frank assisting. Funding was partly from the American Geographic Society. The chronicle of his adventures, with recorded sound adding to the authenticity, was edited down from an estimated 103, 000 feet of footage and proved to be a popular summertime theatrical series in 1931. The studio later re-edited the footage into a feature Untamed Africa, released April 8, 1933, by Warners under the older Vitagraph logo.

Description and history The Kendall Cottage is located in a rural setting west of Harrisville's village center, on the northwest side of Breed Road just north of its junction with Yellow Wings Road. It is a -story timber frame structure, with a gable roof, clapboarded exterior, and central chimney. Its main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows flanking the center entrance. Both the windows and the door are simply trimmed. An ell of similar size to the main block extends to the right, set back. It has three windows and a secondary entrance, with an equipment entrance at the far end. The main (left side) portion of the house was built in 1798 by Joel Kendall; the right-hand portion, a near copy of the left side, was added c. 1930. The house is one of a few surviving vernacular hill farm houses in Harrisville; it was also later the home of Darius Farwell, one of the town's first selectmen.

Like his ancestors he was the head of the Apex body of the Arain Clan called Anjuman-e-Arayan-e-Pakistan which was founded by his ancestors. Besides serving the country and its people, in various capacities, he served the cause of the Arain peoples throughout his life. Early years Sardar Ahmad Ali hailed from the revered Daula Family of Dipalpur which traces its origin from the village Ghazna, Afghanistan. Sardar Ahmad Ali was born in 1914 in his ancestral village Ganja Kalan. His father Sardar Muhammad Ali, apart from having a vast estate, was also an honorary magistrate during the later part of the British rule but died at an early age. He married a Bengali woman from a reputed family in East Bengal. Chairman District Board Sardar Ahmad Ali started his political career at the age of 18 when he was elected Member District Board Lahore in 1930's. In the year 1950, the Sardar Sahib was elected as the first President of the Pakistan Muslim League and the President of the Punjab Council of all district boards. Public Service In 1950 Sardar Ahmad Ali defeated Nawab Qizalbash and was elected Chairman District Board Lahore. He was also elected to the Provincial and the National Assemblies throughout his political career until 1970 and headed a powerful group of MPs, along with Sardar Muhammad Hussain and another cousin Sardar Amjad Masood, which kept a check on the government. Pakistan Movement Since His elder cousin Sardar Muhammad Hussain was an MLA in the 1937 Provincial Assembly and was elected to all the Punjab Assemblies before partition, including the historic elections of 1946 and He was further elected a member of the Punjab Assemblies after 1947 and a member of the West Pakistan Assembly and also remained the President of the Lahore District Muslim League, member of Punjab PML working committee before 1947, besides being the Chief of the Arain Council and later head of the Muslim league in Kasur, therefore Sardar Ahmad Ali was introduced to Mr Jinnah when Mr. Jinnah attended a meeting and public rally near Usmanwala (the headquarter of the family) and where Mr. Jinnah encouraged the young Ahmad Ali to enter into the field of public service. The family has the honour of being one of the founding families of Pakistan as Sardar Muhammad Hussain along with a cousin hailing from the famous Burj Jewa Khan family, both MLA's in the undivided India, cast two votes in favour of the creation of Pakistan. Legacy Perhaps his everlasting accomplishments include his devoted and lifetime service to the Arain people for whose cause he worked very hard and in whom he instilled a sense of unity and pride. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, whose father Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto attended the All India Arain Conference held in 1927 at Ganja Kalan showed immense respect for Sardar Sahibs cause of the Arain people, as Prime Minister. President Zia-ul-Haq visited Sardar Sahib and offered any high position for his support which was not granted to the extent that it was expected by the President. He left Muslim League and Pakistan in 1970 in support of the 1971 Bangladesh Independence Movement. During his political career in Pakistan, he devoted special attention to education and therefore caused numerous government primary and high schools to be established throughout the Lahore District and Kasur. People still remember him for this service. His political career in Bangladesh was short-lived due to illness but he continued to devote special attention to education, environment and developing the jute industry in the region of Jessore, Bangladesh. He is still remembered for his philanthropic contributions, which the living members of the Sardar family has continued ever since.

Life Burdon was born at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, the son of George Burdon, was educated at Newcastle grammar school, and went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1782. He graduated B.A. 1786, and M.A. 1788, when he was elected a Fellow of his college. In the early times of the French Revolution, Burdon's views were republican, but he later modified them. He resigned his fellowship in 1806, on declining to take holy orders, and moved to London; it is thought he had suffered a crisis of faith. He was later an associate of George Cannon, and published in his Theological Enquirer as W.B.

The museum is open to the public daily from April to end September and open six days (closed Sundays) from October to end March. The site of the museum was designated a dark-sky preserve, the first International Dark-Sky Sanctuary in Australia, in 2019. Location The AAOD Museum is located on top of a large mesa named 'The Jump-Up' which is 24 km south-east of Winton, and 600 km south-west of Townsville. Visitors travelling from Longreach, drive northwest along the Landsborough highway for 164 km before turning left onto Dinosaur Drive. From the highway, it is a further 11 km to the Museum on a sealed road. Caravans can be towed to the top of the Jump-Up, although the Museum has provided an unhitching area at the base of the mesa for visitors towing a caravan with a small 2WD vehicle. History In 1999 David Elliott, discovered the fossilised bone of what was, at the time, Australia's largest dinosaur while mustering sheep on his property Belmont near Winton. This bone was later identified as part of a giant femur from a Cretaceous sauropod that roamed the Winton area 95 million years ago.Bryan, S.E., Cook, A.G., Allen, C.M., Siegel, C., Purdy, D.J., Greentree, J.S., Uysal, I.T., (2012) Early-mid Cretaceous tectonic evolution of eastern Gondwana: from silicic LIP magmatism to continental rupture. Episodes 35, 142‚Äì152. Following the discovery of more fossils during digs held in conjunction with the Queensland Museum, David Elliott and Judy Elliott called a public meeting in Winton on 17 August 2002 in view of establishing a dinosaur museum at Winton. On 25 October 2002, 'Australian Age of Dinosaurs Incorporated', commenced operations as a not-for-profit organisation aimed at ensuring future dinosaur digs and the preparation and conservation of dinosaur fossils from the Winton FormationCook, A.G., Bryan, S.E. & Draper, J.J. (2012). Post-orogenic Mesozoic basins and magmatism. Pp 515-575. In Jell, P.A. (ed.). Geology of Queensland. (Geological Survey of Queensland, Brisbane) could continue. The organisation, with support from a strong member's volunteer base, began the initial stages of developing a major tourism attraction in the form of a dinosaur museum so that the discoveries could be preserved for perpetuity and be available to the public. While mustering sheep in March 2005, David Elliott discovered a new dinosaur site on Belmont and a subsequent dig in September uncovered the remains of one of Australia's most complete sauropod skeletons. A total of 17 pallets of fossil bones trapped in a fine siltstone rock were recovered and stored in the Belmont shed. The dinosaur was nicknamed \\"Wade\\", in posthumous honour of Australian Palaeontologist Dr Mary Wade who died during the dig. In late 2005, the discovery of a partial sauropod humerus on Elderslie Station, near Winton, led to a series of digs held by the AAOD Museum and the recovery of two dinosaur skeletons preserved together, one being a sauropod skeleton and the other a theropod. The sauropod was nicknamed \\"Matilda\\" and the theropod was nicknamed \\"Banjo\\" ‚Äì both in honour of Andrew Barton \\"Banjo\\" Paterson and his classic poem \\"Waltzing Matilda\\". In mid-2006, David and Judy Elliott opened an \\"Australian Age of Dinosaurs\\" temporary fossil preparation facility in their shed at Belmont which was known locally as the \\"Prep Shed\\". It was here that fossil preparation was carried out by a small group of staff preparators and volunteers who were accommodated in the station's Jackeroo and Shearers Quarters. Work commenced on Wade and expanded to include the bones of \\"Banjo\\" and \\"Matilda\\" as each dig produced further fossils. This work continued for almost three years and incorporated the help of over 100 volunteers. It was during this time that the 'Free Wade' project began, supported by an Australian Geographic fundraiser and private donations from numerous volunteers, members and supporters. In September 2006, Peter Britton and Carol Britton, owners of Mt Landsborough Station near Winton donated 1,400 hectares of mesa or \\"Jump-Up\\" country to AAOD as a site for the future Museum. Over the following three years funding was raised from Desert Channels Queensland to enable the new site to be fenced. The Winton Shire Council built a new gravel road to the top of the Jump-Up and the Queensland Government contributed $500,000 toward a fossil preparation facility, staff cottages and water and power amenities. The Prep Shed at Belmont was closed and all fossils and equipment relocated to the Jump-Up in early 2009. The new facilities were opened to the public in July 2009 by the Queensland Premier Anna Bligh as part of Queensland's 150th year (Q 150) celebrations. AAOD Inc was restructured in June 2008 to become a not-for-profit Company Limited by Guarantee with a board of up to nine directors. The new company, Australian Age of Dinosaurs Ltd (AAODL) created a Society of Members (Australian Age of Dinosaurs Society) to carry on the support based work of AAOD Inc with levels of membership including ordinary members and life members, known as \\"Million Year Members\\". Buildings Construction of the AAOD Museum is divided into three stages with each stage occupying a different area of the Jump-Up. Construction of Stage 1, which includes a temporary fossil preparation building, two staff cottages and volunteer accommodation facilities, is now complete as is Stage 2 which consists of the Reception Centre for the AAOD Museum and a public car park. Stage 3, which is the future site of the AAOD Museum of Natural History, has completed its concept planning phase and initial construction of outdoor galleries has commenced. The AAOD Museum of Natural History has not yet been funded for construction. =Fossil Preparation Laboratory= The Laboratory is located approximately 500m from the Reception Centre and performs all the preparation, preservation and restoration work necessary to enable the dinosaur fossils to be scientifically studied and put on exhibition. This building is divided into unprepared fossil storage, prepared fossil storage and a large preparation area where staff and volunteers work on removing rock from the bones and consolidating them. A staff room, office, visitor waiting room and equipment storage area are also housed within this facility. As the dinosaur fossils are usually preserved in solid-rock boulders or covered in thick bands of ironstone matrix, it is often a long and time-consuming task to chisel the rock away. Work undertaken at the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Laboratory includes mechanical preparation of the bones with pneumatic scribes which remove rock from the bones. Other activities include restoration, repairs, consolidation of specimens, sieving, sorting of matrix for microfossils and 'jig-saw puzzling' bone fragments together. The laboratory encourages people to help with this preparation by becoming an Honorary Technician which entails a 10-day fossil preparation course at the Museum known as 'Prep-A-Dino'. Dinosaur Stampede exhibit Close up Death in the Billabong exhibit =Reception Centre= The Reception Centre was built on $1 million funding provided by the Australian Government with $50,000 funding from the Queensland Government and pro-bono support from the Winton Shire Council and several corporations. The building was designed by Cox Rayner Architects as a pro-bono contribution to the AAOD Project and built by Woollam Constructions in 2011. It was opened by the Federal Minister for Regional Australia, Simon Crean on 8 April 2012. Designed to blend into the surrounding Jump-Up rock, the building takes on the earthy hues and textures of the surrounding landscape. The concrete walls of the building were coloured and stamped with latex mats that were moulded from the rock surface of the Jump-Up rock by the Elliott Family. A large contingent of volunteers contributed to the final aesthetic finishes of the building including corten steel panels and landscaping. The Reception Centre contains a shop, caf√© and staff facilities as well as a fossil holotype room known as the Collection Room. The building has won several awards for architecture including the J. W. Wilson Award for 'Building of the Year' in central Queensland; the Queensland 'State Award for Public Architecture'; the 'Walls' category of the Queensland 'Public Domain Awards 2013' and the Kevin Cavanagh Medal ‚Äì the Concrete Institute of Australia's highest national award for 'Excellence in Concrete'. It was also shortlisted in the 'Culture' category of the World Architecture Festival Awards in 2012 and again in 2013 under the 'Display' category.Australian Age of Dinosaurs, Journal Issue 10 A life sized, 5m long bronze statue of Australovenator (\\"Banjo\\") stands at the entrance to the Reception Centre. Digitally sculpted by AAOD palaeo-artist Travis R Tischler, the statue was cast by Deep in the Heart Foundry, Texas USA. It was funded by the John Villiers Trust and erected in front of the Reception Centre in April 2012. Collections Room The Collections Room inside the Reception Centre is a climate controlled room that houses the Museum's holotype and paratype fossil specimens. The specimens are displayed in a semi-circle around a public stage where visitors can view the fossils as part of daily guided tours run by the Museum. The holotype fossil bones of Australia's most complete sauropod dinosaurs Diamantinasaurus matildae (\\"Matilda\\") and Savannasaurus elliottorum (\\"Wade\\") as well as the most complete theropod dinosaur Australovenator wintonensis (\\"Banjo\\") and most complete pterosaur \\"Ferrodraco lentoni\\" (\\"Butch\\") are on display. The Collection Room is fitted with audio visual equipment which complements the guided tours by showing animation footage of western Queensland's dinosaurs. This footage consists of excerpts from the documentary Monsters in the Outback which was produced for the Museum by Bearcage Studios in 2013 through funding provided to AAOD by BHP Billiton. =Dinosaur Canyon Outpost and Outdoor Galleries= Dinosaur Canyon Outpost and Outdoor Galleries was finished in April 2017 through a combination of government funds, private sponsorship and the Museum's contributions from operating funds. The new attraction consists of an Outpost perched on the cliff overlooking Dinosaur Canyon and includes 300 metres of elevated concrete pathway throughout the gorge below. Five outdoor galleries are positioned along the pathway, which resembles a treetop walk as it winds throughout massive boulders and thick vegetation below the rim of a gorge. The Dinosaur Canyon exhibits recreate life as it would have appeared during the Cretaceous Period including: Dinosaur Stampede, Pterodactylus Family, Kunbarrasaurus ieversi, Death in the Billabong and Valley of the Cycads. Fossils =Dating= The vast majority of the dinosaur fossils discovered by the AAOD Museum are from the earliest Late Cretaceous period and are approximately 98-95 million years old. This has been determined using radiometric dating of zircons - tiny grains which fall between 60 and 200 microns that form part of the sandstones which make up the Winton Formation. Measuring radiogenic isotopes within individual zircon grains taken from the \\"Matilda site\\" confirmed an Early Cenomanian age meaning that the sites in that area are at least as young as 95 million years. =Winton Formation= The Winton Formation is a paralic to terrestrial/freshwater depositCook, A.G., Bryan, S.E. & Draper, J.J. (2012). Post-orogenic Mesozoic basins and magmatism. Pp 515-575. In Jell, P.A. (ed.). Geology of Queensland. (Geological Survey of Queensland, Brisbane). that is remnant of a vast network of river floodplains that drained northward into the Eromanga Sea in the late Albian to Cenomanian stages of the Cretaceous period. The deposit is up to 1.2 km thick in south west Queensland and becomes thinner as it extends north toward Winton due to both erosion and original distribution. The Winton Formation thins out just north of Winton due to regional dip and the semicircular outcrop pattern of the Eromanga Basin. Winton Formation overlies the older marine deposits of the Mackunda Formation. The Mackunda Formation represents the final phase of the inland sea that receded from the Winton area approximately 100-98 million years ago. The bones of \\"Elliot\\" and \\"Wade\\" were discovered 80 km north-east of Winton and were deposited very close to the shores of the retreating inland sea. The Winton Formation has produced the remains of more large dinosaurs than the rest of Australia combined making it the country's most extensive and prolific dinosaur deposit. =The Great Australian Basin= The Great Australian Basin occupies nearly one-fifth of the Australian continent and includes three constituent basins in central and northern Queensland; the Carpentaria Basin in the north, the Eromanga Basin in the centre and south and the Surat Basin in the far southeast. Over a period of 30 million years, the Great Australian Basin has been flooded by five phases of inland seas. Those that left a surface fossil record are the early Aptian Sea (125 ‚Äì 120 million years ago); the late Aptian Sea (116-112 million years ago); the early middle Albian Sea (108-105 million years ago) and the late Albian Sea (104-100 million years ago).Burger, D. (1986) Palynology, cyclic sedimentation and palaeoenvironments in the late Mesozoic of the Eromanga Basin. Special Publication of the Geological Society of Australia. 12: 53-70 The Winton Formation is situated in the Eromanga Basin and is the youngest (uppermost) deposit laid down during formation of that Basin. This terrestrial deposit ended 30 million years of marine domination and heralded a new phase of deposition that would see the Basin become a place of lush open forests and flood plains dominated by conifers,McLoughlin, S, Drinnan, A.N., & Rozefelds, A.

Over the 98 million years following its final development phase, the Eromanga Basin has undergone periods of deep weathering, erosion and uplift which have exposed the basin as it is found today.Cook, A.G. & Jell, J.S. (2012) Paleogene and Neogene. Pp 577-652. In Jell, P.A. (ed.). Geology of Queensland. (Geological Survey of Queensland, Brisbane). It is this process that has exposed the fossil-rich marine rocks to the north of Winton that were deposited in the latter stages of the Basin's formation between 125 and 100 million years ago and continues to produce the fossils of Australia's Cretaceous dinosaurs throughout the Winton Formation. =The Jump-Up= The Jump-Up is a large mesa plateau that is approximately 270m above sea level and stands 75m above the surrounding land and forms part of a mesa formation called the Vindex Range. Like much of the Winton Shire, the Jump-Up is part of the Winton Formation, which is dated around 95-98 million years old. The cap-rock surface of the Jump-Up is solid rock of varying thickness up to 12 metres that has resisted erosion throughout a period of deep weathering that eroded the surrounding countryside away. The top of the Jump-Up represents the land surface prior to this weathering phase which is estimated by geologists to have commenced between 25mya and 30mya.Cook, A.G. & Jell, J.S. (2012).Paleogene and Neogene. Pp 577-652. In Jell, P.A. (ed.). Geology of Queensland. (Geological Survey of Queensland, Brisbane) The Jump-Up is home to a diverse fauna including numerous lizard species, echidna and over 100 species of birds. It is also home to a unique floral biodiversity that includes rain forest fig species that have survived in the moist, sheltered gorges ‚Äì remnant species of a time when inland Australia had a much wetter climate. In 2019 The Jump-Up was designated Australia's first International Dark-Sky Sanctuary by the International Dark- Sky Association. The area met the criteria for land that has distinguished quality of starry nights and a nocturnal environment that is protected in a very remote location with few nearby threats to the quality of its dark night skies. Australian Age of Dinosaurs Journals Since 2003, Australian Age of Dinosaurs has published an annual journal on Australian natural history. The journal is compiled and edited by David Elliott and Judy Elliott and incorporates the scientific research and life's work of Australia's leading palaeontologists. The journal gives an up-to-date account of the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum's annual progress along with an overview of scientific discussions, scientific research processes and an annual profile of palaeontologists who have devoted a large part of their lives to better understanding our knowledge of the Australian continent. The Journal is distributed each year to subscribing members who receive a variety of discounts/ special offers and a quarterly newsletter. The museum also offers Million Year Membership which includes life membership along with invitations to special events, lifelong free entry to the museum and the option of becoming a member of AAOD Ltd. In its fourteenth year the AAOD journal continues to be an unmatched repository of Australian dinosaur information and palaeo news in Australia. Public involvement =Prep-A-Dino Experience= The Australian Age of Dinosaurs has an active preparation program for public involvement through its Prep-A-Dino program. The process of preparing a dinosaur bone is a time-consuming job which involves carefully chipping away layers of stone to reveal the embedded dinosaur bone inside. The museum offers a fully inducted training session and tour of the museum before participants embark on prepping a dinosaur bone. The museum offers onsite accommodation at Maloney Lodge as part of its Prep-A-Dino package. The lodge consists of five furnished rooms, a communal kitchen and a fully equipped bathroom/ laundry. Maloney Lodge was completed in 2010 and offers laboratory participants the chance to work and live at a real dinosaur museum. Prep-A-Dino participants can qualify as an Honorary Technician after completing 10 days of preparation and training with the Australian Age of Dinosaurs. Although the initial 10-day training period attracts a daily charge, once participants become qualified Honorary Technicians their only further cost is an annual one day refresher course. =Dig-A-Dinosaur Experience= Since 2004, the museum has hosted dinosaur digs that can be attended by members of the public. Digs are usually held in late May and early June and attract a participation charge which helps cover the cost of holding the dig and preparation of fossils recovered. The digs take place in the Mitchell grass downs country of the Winton district, and have produced numerous dinosaur fossils ‚Äì many of which have become holotype specimens. On the Elliott's property alone there have been 15 confirmed sites identified across the 18,000 hectare Station. Researchers The AAOD collection has attracted considerable interest from palaeontologists, both in Australia and abroad. Palaeontologists closely involved with the Museum collection include, in alphabetical order: =Dr Alex Cook= As former Curator of Invertebrate Palaeontology and Senior Curator of Geosciences at the Queensland Museum, Alex Cook is a widely published researcher who is recognised for his work on invertebrate faunas of the Great Artesian Basin and the Palaeozoic of north Queensland.Cook, A.G., Bryan, S.E. & Draper, J.J. (2012).Post-orogenic Mesozoic basins and magmatism. Pp 515-575. In Jell, P.A. (ed.). Geology of Queensland. (Geological Survey of Queensland, Brisbane). Cook has been Honorary Curator of the AAOD Museum Collection since 2004 and continues a strong association with the Museum through the acquisition and curation of fossils representing Australia's major evolutionary sequences in preparation for public exhibition. In 2018, the Museum's second publication Geology of Outback Queensland written by Cook was published. =Dr Scott Hocknull= Scott Hocknull is Senior Curator of Vertebrate Palaeontology at the Queensland Museum. He was first author on a paper published by PLoS One in 2009 that named three new Australian dinosaur species from the Winton Formation including Diamantinasaurus matildae, Australovenator wintonensis and Wintonotitan wattsi.Hocknull, S.A., White, M.A., Tischler, T.R., Cook, A.G., Calleja, N.D., Sloan, T., Elliott, D.A., (2009) New mid-Cretaceous (latest Albian) dinosaurs from Winton, Queensland, Australia. PLOS One 4, e6190 Hocknull is currently spearheading ground-breaking research into Dinosaur Stampede National Monument at Lark Quarry near Winton. =Dr Benjamin Kear= Benjamin Kear is an assistant professor and docent in Historical Geology and Palaeontology at Uppsala University in Sweden. He is carrying out an initial descriptive survey of marine fossils in the AAOD Collection recovered from the uppermost Mackunda Formation near Winton. These specimens which include marine reptiles, turtles and fish were recovered in close proximity to Winton Formation dinosaur bones on Belmont Station. Kear's research will ascertain what taxa are present in the assemblage and enable him to compile a taxonomic list for a quantitative survey of marine vertebrate biodiversity across the Aptian-Cenomanian within the Eromanga Basin.Poropat, S.F., Upchurch, P., Mannion, P.D., Hocknull, S.A., Kear, B.P., Sloan, T., Sinapius, G.H.K., Elliott, D.A., 2015.

In recent years he has studied bennettitalean, conifer and horsetail fossils from Belmont Station held in the AAOD Museum collection. The significance of the Winton Formation fossil flora is that it represents the youngest major assemblage of plant fossils from the Cretaceous of Australia. Stratigraphically, the next major plant assemblage on the continent is from the late Paleocene ‚Äì some 35 million years later. The Winton Formation plant assemblage marks the transition from gymnosperm to angiosperm dominance in the Australian floras. The Winton Formation flora is now known to contain over 50 macrofossil plant taxa. Significantly, this assemblage contains the youngest Australian fossils of equisetaleans, pentoxylaleans, and possibly bennettitaleans ‚Äì all groups that appear to have succumbed to competition from the rapidly diversifying angiosperms of this time. One of the youngest records of Ginkgo leaves from Australia also comes from the Winton Formation. Araucarian, cupressacean and podocarp conifers are all well represented in the fossil flora. The flowering plants represented in this flora have mostly toothed or lobed leaf types and are of possible fagaceous or betulaceous affinities but their precise relationships remain unclear. The oldest Australian monocot angiosperms are also known from this formation. The composition of the flora and morphological characters of the leaves and woods attest to growth in a cool seasonal climate without extremes of precipitation.McLoughlin, S, Drinnan, A.N., & Rozefelds, A. C. (1995) A Cenomanian flora from the Winton Formation, Eromanga Basin, Queensland, Australia.

He has been working extensively with Paul Upchurch (University College London) and Philip Mannion (Imperial College London) on a revision of Australia's Cretaceous sauropod fauna. =Travis Tischler= Travis Tischler, an Australian palaeo-artist, has been working closely with the AAOD Museum since 2006. He has been in charge of AAOD's digital dinosaur reconstruction program since 2009 and has developed highly detailed and anatomically accurate flesh restorations through the use of digital modelling. Through a combination of CAT scans, MRI scans and photogrammetry modelling, Tischler has been able to digitally recreate and restore dinosaur fossils into full skeletons. By studying their range of motion, muscle attachment scars and structural capacities, he has created \\"reverse dissection\\" models of dinosaur musculature, providing an accurate body form on which detailed, functional skin interpretations can be reconstructed. =Dr Paul Upchurch and Dr Philip Mannion= Paul Upchurch is a Reader in Palaeobiology at University College London and Philip Mannion is a Junior Research Fellow at Imperial College London. Both Upchurch and Mannion have visited the AAOD Collection and have formed a collaborative affiliation with Poropat and Hocknull. The aim of this project is a thorough revision of the Australian Cretaceous sauropod fauna, with a view to establishing the relationships of Australia's sauropods to those throughout the world. =Dr Matt White= Matt White completed a PhD on the reconstruction and biomechanics of Australovenator wintonensis.White MA., Cook AG, Rumbold SJ (2017) A methodology of theropod print replication utilising the pedal reconstruction of Australovenator and a simulated paleo- sediment. PeerJ: 10.7717/peerj.3427 He has authored several papers on new skeletal elements of Australovenator which have been uncovered following the holotype description. His research includes working on skeletal range of motion to rebuild the muscles and tendons of Australovenator's forearms and hind limbs. White has been working with radiographer Sarah Wooldridge and staff at Queensland Xray in Mackay to CT scan all of the Australovenator material along with other type material from the AAOD Museum collection. These scans have been converted to three dimensional images which have been used in publications and dinosaur reconstruction.White MA., Cook AG, Hocknull SA, Sinapius GHK, Sloan, T et al.

PLOS One 7(6): e39364.doi:10.1371/ journal.pone.0039364 Future plans The AAOD Museum's third and final stage consists of a purpose built, multimillion-dollar natural history museum that will portray the evolution of the Australian continent over the past 4.5 billion years and Australia's unique dinosaur heritage. The new museum building which will include education facilities is planned for 2020 and initial work including concept planning and design has been completed. The AAOD Museum of Natural History will be located 2 km from the Museum's Reception Centre, and positioned overlooking the plains below the Jump-Up. The buildings' concept statistics allow for a floor space of 6,000 square meters of which 1,800 square metres will be exhibition floor space. The remainder of the building's planned space will be divided between public space, gift shop and caf√© facilities, back‚Äìof-house management, collection room, laboratory, school classrooms and audio visual facilities. Other exhibitions currently being planned for the AAOD Museum include a suite of outdoor galleries that will be positioned throughout the gorge of the Jump- Up. These galleries will exhibit life-size bronze sculptures of Australia's dinosaurs and their environment and initial construction on the first of these is currently underway.Australian Age of Dinosaurs, Journal Issue 11 References Educational institutions established in 2003 Historical societies of Australia Museums in Queensland Central West Queensland 2003 establishments in Australia Natural history museums in Australia Dinosaur museums ","title":"Australian Age of Dinosaurs"},{"id":"42516910","text":"Marwa Rakha (born 1978) is an Egyptian relationship and dating expert.

In the visual Photometric system magnitude it is 14.90(R)(towards the red end of the visual spectrum) and 16.40(B)(the blue end of the spectrum) (see also Apparent magnitude.) It is a BY Draconis variable changing brightness slightly, probably from starspots, with a period of 33.695 days. The star is Red dwarf/M-class bordering on being an Orange dwarf/K-class star, with a mass nearly half that of the Sun's, with a density ~1.59 x 105 kg/m3. Discovery of a planetary system Within two first years of gathered data, the signals of four inner planetary candidates were found. Discussion of planets in the system was taking place in August and November 2013. See comment by \\"Holger 16 November 2013 at 14:21\\". ^ ^ ^ In February 2014, those planets were confirmed through the \\"verification by multiplicity\\" method. The fifth outermost candidate was confirmed in the same manner in April 2014. The possibility that the signals in the light curve of the star were actually from something else has been ruled out by an investigation with the W. M. Keck and Gemini Observatories, using speckle imaging and adaptive optics techniques, which, while unable to resolve the planets, were able to rule out other possibilities than the system of planets. Planetary system The five planets discovered around Kepler-186 are all expected to have a solid surface. The smallest one, Kepler-186b, is only 8% larger than Earth, while the largest one, Kepler-186d, is almost 40% larger. The four innermost planets are probably tidally locked, but Kepler-186f is further out, where the star's tidal effects are much weaker, so there may not have been enough time for its spin to slow down that much. Because of the very slow evolution of red dwarf stars, the age of the Kepler-186 system is poorly constrained, although it is likely to be greater than a few billion years. There is a roughly 50-50 chance it is tidally locked. Since it is closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, it will probably rotate much more slowly than Earth; its day could be weeks or months long (see Tidal effects on rotation rate, axial tilt and orbit). Planetary formation simulations have also shown that there could be one additional non-transiting low-mass planet between Kepler-186e and Kepler-186f. If this planet exists, it is likely not much more massive than Earth. If it were, its gravitational influence would likely prevent Kepler-186f from transiting.Formation, tidal evolution and habitability of the Kepler-186 system, Emeline Bolmont, Sean N. Raymond, Philip von Paris, Franck Selsis, Franck Hersant, Elisa V. Quintana, Thomas Barclay, (Submitted on 16 Apr 2014) Conjectures involving the Titius‚ÄìBode law, (and the related Dermott's law) indicate that there could be several remaining planets to be found in the system - two small ones between e and f and another larger one outside of f. That hypothetical outer planet must have an orbital radius beyond 16.4 AU for planetary system to remain stable. The low metallicity of the star at a metallicity (dex) of -0.26, or to put it another way, about half that of the Sun's, is associated with a decreased chance of planets overall and giant planets specifically but an increased chance of Earth sized planets, in a general study of stars. Naming =Kepler project= As the Kepler telescope observational campaign progressed initial identifications of systems were entered in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC), and then progressed as a candidate host of planets as Kepler Object of Interest (KOI).

He is known for \\"his musical blend of Native American heritage, glam fashion consciousness, cyberpunk attitude, and often skeptical, always opinionated lyrical approach to scientific and sociological subjects.\\" Biography Todd Tamanend Clark was born on August 10, 1952 in Greensboro, Pennsylvania, to Frederick Leland Clark (1923‚Äì2003) and Hope Ramona Harvey (1925‚Äì2001). Author Adrienne Mayor describes him as being Seneca and Lenape. He graduated from Waynesburg Central High School in 1970 and from Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in Communication in 1983. He then went on to graduate school at Indiana University of Pennsylvania studying art and anthropology. In 1975, he started to record music under the alias The Stars. Two years later, he formed the Butler, Pennsylvania based rock band The Eyes. The band's album, New Gods: Aardvark Through Zymurgy was released in 1977 and has been called \\"the holy grail of psychedelic collectibles.\\" In 1978, The Eyes (with two personnel changes) evolved into The Todd Clark Group, who released their \\"We're Not Safe!\\" album in 1979. In the early 1980s, he mutated his psychedelic rock style into a more electronic music-oriented sound. The \\"Secret Sinema\\" and \\"Flame Over Philadelphia\\" singles, which were released in 1980 and 1985 respectively, became college radio hits. In 1984, Clark released Into The Vision, which featured appearances from Allen Ravenstine of Pere Ubu and Cheetah Chrome of The Dead Boys, as well as the Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs. During this time, he immersed himself more deeply into his Native American heritage, adopting the middle name \\"Tamanend\\", which is what his grandfather called him as a child. In between 1986 and 1999, he stopped releasing new material and devoted his time to his children, although he continued to compose music and perform at occasional concerts. Between 2000 and 2004, Clark released three interrelated instrumental albums: Owls In Obsidian (2000), Staff, Mask, Rattle (2002), and Monongahela Riverrun (2004). In 2005, his first decade of recordings was collected chronologically on the double-disc compilation album, Nova Psychedelia, through Anopheles Records. In 2014, he released a complexly orchestrated darkly psychedelic cyberpunk album Dancing Through The Side Worlds, which contains many autobiographical songs. The front cover features a painting of Clark shapeshifting into an owl by Steven Johnson Leyba. Clark is currently recording a thematically related follow-up album Whirlwind Of The Whispering Worlds which will be forthcoming in 2020. A photograph of his son, X Tecumseh Clark (born October 7, 1984), was featured on the cover art of Canadian electronic music band Crystal Castles' second eponymous album in 2010. Another of his five sons, Sachem Orenda Clark (born February 21, 1988), has his own solo career as a multi-instrumentalist and also plays guitar on some of his father's albums. Todd Tamanend Clark has resided in Fayette County, Pennsylvania since January 1992. Political Activism While an art school student in San Francisco, Todd Tamanend Clark was friends with Wilma Mankiller and participated in the Native American occupation of Alcatraz Island.http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/alcatrazproclamationandletter.html Clark was later mentored into the American Indian Movement by Russell Means. Clark is the Minister of Information for the Pennsylvania chapter of Autonomous A.I.M. Literary Style Despite playing a multitude of musical instruments, Todd Tamanend Clark is first and foremost a poet. He even considers his instrumental songs to be tone poems. Poetically, he was influenced by Allen Ginsberg, Leonard Cohen, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Jim Morrison, and Patti Smith. His poetry is much more complex than what is usually found in rock music. In a 2006 review, Julian Cope called him \\"the T.S. Eliot of his time.https://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/albumofthemonth/new-gods-aardvark- thru-zymurgy\\" Clark also writes essays on Native American cultures and civil rights. Musical Style Clark's music in the 1970s was described as \\"electro-psychedelic glam-rock\\" and \\"unique fusion of wild 60s-style experimentalism and proto-new wave synth-freakery.\\" His early influences included the 1960s psychedelic rock of The Mothers Of Invention, The Doors, The Electric Prunes, Jimi Hendrix, and especially the early adopters of analog synthesizers such as The United States of America, Lothar and the Hand People, and Silver Apples, while he was also attuned to the sounds of the proto punk rock scene, such as The Seeds, The Music Machine, The Velvet Underground, The MC5, and The Stooges. In the 1980s, he switched to an experimental rock sound, taking inspirations from artists like The Residents and Laurie Anderson and the works of science fiction, cyberpunk and stream-of-consciousness writers such as Harlan Ellison and William S. Burroughs. He was also inspired by comic books, most prominently by Turok and Doctor Strange, but also by Batman, Green Arrow, The Haunt of Fear, Shock SuspenStories, Strange Tales, Strange Adventures, Challengers of the Unknown, Adam Strange, The Doom Patrol, Animal Man, Swamp Thing, Love and Rockets, Coyote, Aztec Ace, and Scout, as well as 1950s monster movies, most prominently by Forbidden Planet and Creature From the Black Lagoon, but also by It Came From Outer Space, Terror From the Year 5000, The Flame Barrier, Kronos, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.http://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2015/07/an-interview-with- todd-tamanend-clark.html Music Equipment =Synthesizers= ARP 2600, ARP Avatar, ARP Quadra, ARP Odyssey, Dave Smith Instruments Pro 2, Dave Smith Instruments Prophet '08, Dave Smith Instruments Prophet Rev2-16, E-mu Emulator II+HD, E-mu Emax, E-mu E-Synth, E-mu Morpheus, E-mu Orbit, E-mu Planet Earth, E-mu Vintage Keys, E-mu Xtreme Lead-1, Ensoniq MR-61, Ensoniq MR-Rack, Ensoniq TS-10, Hammond 102200, Korg Kronos 2‚Äì88, Maestro Theremin, Moog Etherwave Plus Theremin, Moog Memorymoog Plus, Moog Micromoog, Moog Minimoog Model D, Moog Minimoog Voyager, Moog Polymoog 203A, Moog Taurus 1, Moog Taurus 3, Oberheim Matrix-1000, Oberheim Xpander, Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 =Guitars and Violins= Ampeg Dan Armstrong, B.C.

Early life and work  Jerry Cooke was born as Yuri Kutschuk in Odessa into Jewish family. New born Jerry, with his father, Gregory Kutschuk, and his mother, Assia Azrilenko, and the rest of the family emigrated to Milan, Italy and then to Berlin, Germany in 1923. While in Berlin, Yuri's father sold photographs to European publications. Yuri's aunt, Celia Kutschuk, worked at the Associated Press, with Wilson Hicks, who later became Executive Editor in charge of photography for Life. In 1936, after Adolf Hitler's rise to power, the family fled back to Italy, where they then had to flee from Benito Mussolini's regime to Bombay, India. In Bombay they lived in the Outram Private Hotel owned by his uncle, George Azrilenko. In 1939, the family emigrated to United States, arriving to Seattle from Japan on the \\"Hiye Mare\\" and taking a train to New York. Once in the U.S. his name was anglicized to Jerry Cooke. Cecile Kutschuk, who had studied photojournalism at the Rhine University, emigrated to the United States in 1935, and started a photo agency in New York City called Pix Publishing. She gave Jerry his first camera, a Rolleiflex. Celia Kutschuk put him to work in the Pix darkroom, where he was assistant to photographers Alfred Eisenstaedt, George Karger, and others. In 1945, on V-J Day in Times Square, Jerry Cooke was with Eisenstaedt when he photographed the iconic image of the nurse and sailor kissing.  Career  Cooke's career in photojournalism began working for newspapers and magazines, including Life Magazine, Collier's, Ladies Home Journal, and others. In 1948, Cooke, Robert Capa, and Tim Gidal traveled to Israel to photograph the new state for the book, This Is Israel,This Is Israel, by I.F. Stone, Boni and Gaer, New York, 1948 written by I.F. Stone. One of Cooke's first assignments for Fortune was Nabisco, the Dough is Rising, 1948. Walker Evans described the lead photograph, \\"The picture is quiet and true. Since I am writing about photography let me point out that this picture is a better part of the story at hand than either a drawing or a painting would be. There is a profitable and well-run cracker firm in a sweaty part of the town, there is a knot of men talking on the pavement about anything but crackers, amidst the irrelevant trucks. This is where Mal-o-Mars are cooked and this is where last week's newspaper meets the gutter too. And the Strand Hotel becomes famous for flavour. My point is Fortune photographs should take a long look at a subject, get into it, and without shouting, tell a lot about it.\\" In 1950, Fortune's Art Director Leo Lionni hired Cooke to document Milwaukee factories. Cooke spent the entire summer visiting and photographing 26 factories. Cooke considered this essay an \\"epic effort,\\" photographing in both color and black & white. The article, \\"Made in Milwaukee,\\" appeared in November 1950. A founding member of the American Society of Media Photographers, Cooke served as president from 1951- 1952. Cooke's portrait was photographed by Arnold Newman and used for the society's magazine. During his presidency, ASMP News became a magazine and was licensed by the State of New York to act as a labor union. Cooke's award-winning photograph, \\"Ohio Insane Asylum\\", and others were selected for the international exhibition, The Family of Man, 1955 curated by Edward Steichen for the Museum of Modern Art. This photograph appeared in Life's essay, BEDLAM 1946: Most U.S. Mental Hospitals are a Shame and a Disgrace by Albert Q. Maisel. Cooke returned to Russia in the summer of 1957 to cover Russia and Physical Fitness for Sports Illustrated. He was one of the first westerners permitted to photograph in post-Stalin Russia. In 1958, while on assignment, Cooke decided to visit Boris Pasternak in Peredelkino, just outside Moscow. He found Pasternak working in his garden. Cooke gave Pasternak his copy of Dr. Zhivago. He travelled by bus in disguise, because photography was not permitted without the government's approval. He stayed for the day and took many photos of the writer, his wife and his dog. Soon after, Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize, and Cooke's photographs appeared in a Life essay, October 27, 1958. Cooke travelled extensively to Russia throughout his career, up until the mid 1990s. Bradley Smith and Cooke founded the picture agency, Animals Animals in 1969. The agency was sold in the late 1970s and renamed Animals Animals Earth Scenes. During the late 1980s, Cooke traveled to major over crowded cities to photograph the condition of the population. His photographs were published in The Exploding City The Exploding City, text by Robert Schiffer, photographs by Jerry Cooke, St. Martin's Press, 1989 in 1989 by the United Nations. Cooke spoke several languages, visited five continents and well over a hundred countries. = Sports photography = In 1953, after seeing his photographs of a football game for a Life essay, Cooke was recruited by Gerald Astor to photograph for a new magazine, Sports Illustrated. This launched Cooke's career in sports photography. Cooke worked for over 40 years, shooting 47 covers for Sports Illustrated, including many from the early days starting in October 1954. In the 1973 World Series, Cooke captured Willie Mays arguing with umpire Augie Donatelli in one of the ten greatest World Series photographs. Cooke was named Director of Photography for Sports Illustrated in 1974. He photographed 16 Olympics and 42 Kentucky Derbies, including three Triple Crown winners: Secretariat (horse), Seattle Slew, and Affirmed.

He was a National Representative during the Hundred Days when Napoleon returned from Elba, a Deputy from 1815 to 1821, a peer of France and three times Minister of Finance. Early years Antoine Roy was born in Savigny, Haute-Marne, on 5 March 1764. His parents were Charles Roy, bourgeois and resident of Savigny and Miss Claudette Grisot. He studied at the College of Langres, then studied law in Paris and was admitted to the bar in 1785. He did not approve of the French Revolution and remained at the bar, but took advantage of the opportunity to acquire national property in 1791. He defended Rozoy in 1792, and in the year III defended several of the accused of 13 Vend√©miaire. On 17 April 1793 Roy married Ad√©la√Øde-Sophie Barr√©, daughter of Jean-Beno√Æt-Vincent Barr√©, an architect, and Marie-F√©licit√© Germain. They had two daughters, Marie-√âlisa (1794‚Äì1851) and Alexandrine-Sophie-Laure (1799‚Äì1854). Roy associated with Claude Caroillon Destilli√®res in exploiting the forests and in running major ironworks. During the Revolution and the Empire Roy was a leading provider of supplies to the Ministries of War and the Navy, which protected him from problems arising from his royalist sympathies. Roy's openly royalist leanings led to the Duke of Bouillon giving him enjoyment of the land of Navarre and the administration of its forests in 1798. He acquired the greater part of the property of the Duke of Bouillon, who was having grave financial difficulties, in exchange for an annual payment of 300,000 francs. A few months later the Duke died suddenly and Roy became one of the richest landowners in France. In 1801 he was sued by the state for repayment of 2 million francs, saying he had wrongly taken that amount while administering the Duke's property, which was now the property of the State. Roy refused to give up his claim to the forest of Navarre, but lost trials in 1802 and again in 1813. The Navarre domains passed to the Empress Josephine, then to prince Eug√®ne de Beauharnais and his son. Roy never forgave Napoleon for this. During the Hundred Days when Napoleon returned from exile Roy was elected on 7 May 1815 to represent the Seine. He stood as an irreconcilable opponent of Napoleon. On 6 June 1815 he opposed taking the oath of fidelity. On 16 June he asked for a special committee to examine whether war was necessary. During the discussion of financial law, he took the floor again and tried all methods of removing resources from the army. Bourbon restoration L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur, by Nicolas-Pierre Tiolier When the Bourbon court returned from Ghent Roy hastened to meet it. He was received as a victim of imperial despotism, but the king expressed the view that if he had a complaint, it was not of poverty. Roy was reelected deputy on 22 August 1815, and again on 4 October 1816 and 20 September 1817. He often voted with the minority, particularly on secondary issues, and affected a degree of liberalism. He was rapporteur of the budget in 1817 and 1818, and in this role in 1819 found a saving of 19 millions. On 7 December 1818 he was called to succeed Louis- Emmanuel Corvetto as Minister of Finance, but was unable to achieve any reforms before the Richelieu cabinet resigned on 28 December 1818. He was named Minister of State and member of the Privy Council, Commissioner of the Sinking Fund and of the Deposit and Consignment Office. He returned to his seat in the Chamber, and was responsible for reviewing the backlog of financial statements for the years 1815‚Äì1818. After his report on the new budget he obtained a reduction of 20 million in the movable and immovable contributions. On 19 November 1819 he was again appointed Minister of Finance, replacing Baron Louis. He held this position until 14 December 1821, and initiated several reforms that significantly improved the financial situation of France. On 4 January 1820 he filed a proposal for the final release of the purchasers of national property. On 16 January 1821 he obtained a considerable reduction of land taxes. After the evacuation of territory by the allies he regularized departmental debts. In December 1821 he handed his portfolio to Jean-Baptiste de Vill√®le. He was made a peer of France on 13 December 1821 and created a Count by the king. In the Upper House he continued to occupy himself mainly with financial issues. When Jean-Baptiste de Martignac formed his ministry Roy was appointed Minister of Finance for a third time, holding office from 5 January 1828 to 7 August 1829. However, his financial proposals met many obstacles from the parliamentary majority. King Charles X decided to form a strong reactionary cabinet under Jules de Polignac, and asked Roy to keep his portfolio. However, due to the attached conditions Roy felt obliged to refuse. July monarchy Roy retired on 21 February 1830, and was awarded the orders of the Holy Spirit and St. Michel. From then on Roy devoted himself exclusively to the business of the upper chamber. He accepted the government of Louis Philippe I without hesitation and was often responsible for reports on taxes, the lottery and the budget. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. Antoine Roy died in Paris on 3 April 1847, aged 83. He left a fortune that was estimated at 40 million francs.

Paralympics GB Early years Ruddock was born in Rugby, Warwickshire, diagnosed with cerebral palsy, a neuro-muscular condition caused by his premature birth. He attended Bishop Wulstan School to study at GCSE level, taking a profound interest in languages, history and politics. He found it difficult to play the predominant playground sport of football, due to a severe lack of lower body coordination. He however found great pleasure in basketball and cites films like Space Jam and Coach Carter as major influences on his extra-curricular ambitions in physical education. After completing his GCSE's, he took scholarship exams in 2006 and was subsequently offered a full academic scholarship to attend Rugby School to study English, History and Economics, as a day pupil in Town House. Loughborough University After completing his A-Levels, Ruddock chose to study International Relations at Loughborough University. He became immersed in the ethos of Loughborough campus life and took up American football alongside his studies, playing linebacker for the Loughborough Aces, as the only player with a physical disability in the British University League. In late 2011, his final year of study, he was approached by an athletics coach during one of the football team's quarterly combine testing sessions. The coach, Joe McDonnell, spotted Ruddock's impairment and offered to coach him in disability sprinting, singling him out for his speed and power over short distances.

Biography Alfred Solman (Saloman or Salomon prior to 1894) was born in Berlin, Germany, and educated at the Berlin Conservatory of Music.The ASCAP Biographical Dictionary, p. 470; ‚ÄúNew Firm of Writers,‚Äù The New York Dramatic Mirror, December 26, 1903, p. 20. He arrived in the United States on February 8, 1894, with his wife Eugenie and young son Kurt (later Curt), settling in Chicago, where he worked as a musician or music teacher and where his daughter Lucy (sometimes Lucille) was born on December 1, 1895.New York Passenger List, SS Rhaetia, February 8, 1894; Chicago City Directories, 1895‚Äì7; Cook County Illinois Birth Certificates Index. Salmon‚Äôs cousin, Victor Kremer, had immigrated on November 29, 1892, and by 1898 Kremer had formed a music publishing firm and issued Solman‚Äôs first song, ‚ÄúMiss Phoebe Johnsing.‚ÄùNew York Passenger List, SS Dresden, November 29, 1892; Chicago City Directories, 1896‚Äì1900. Kremer and the Solman family shared a residence from 1898 to 1900, and during or shortly after that time the Solman couple became estranged and then divorced. On July 6, 1903 Eugenia Saloman married Victor Kremer.Chicago City Directories, 1898‚Äì1900; Cook County Illinois Marriages. After the breakup of his marriage Alfred Solman led a somewhat restless life. In 1902 he was in San Francisco, writing songs and appearing in vaudeville as a baritone.‚ÄúBills Offered to Playgoers,‚Äù San Francisco Chronicle, September 10, 1902, p. 20; ‚ÄúMusic and Musicians,‚Äù The Billboard 14:51 (December 20, 1902), p. 6. By December 1903 he was in New York City, where he joined with Walter Hawley to write sketches and monologues as well as songs.‚ÄúNew Firm of Writers,‚Äù loc. cit.; New York City Directory, 1905, in which Solman is listed as a ‚Äúdramatist.‚Äù The following year he signed an exclusive contact with Joseph W.

Musical Compositions (Washington: Government Printing Office), 1906‚Äì11. Solman remained in New York through the decade, though he maintained a presence in Chicago and went to Europe at least once, in 1910.‚ÄúThe Music Belt,‚Äù The New York Star, I:16 (January 15, 1909, p. 28; ‚ÄúGreetings from Alfred Solman,‚Äù The New York Clipper LVIII:33 (October 1, 1910), p. 818. He remained very interested in theatre, writing music for Paris by Night (1904), The Errand Boy (1906), and other shows and revues; and he and Harry Bissing, a stage electrician, formed a short-lived management company.‚ÄúParis by Night,‚Äù The New York Dramatic Mirror, July 17, 1904, p. 18; ‚ÄúAt the Theatres,‚Äù The Atlanta Constitution, February 25, 1906, p.

In 1910 Solman won a prize offered by Carl Laemmle, a Chicago publisher and film maker. Jos. W. Stern & Co. sued for $10,000 in damages on the grounds that, at the time, it had Solman under an exclusive contract. Stern eventually won, though the case took three years to conclude; in the meantime, and probably as a consequence, Solman left Stern and signed a contract with Laemmle.‚Äú$10,000 Verdict for Song,‚Äù The New York Times, December 7, 1913, p. 12; ‚ÄúLaemmle Signs Solman,‚Äù The Billboard 23:12 (March 25, 1911), p. 14. Less than a year later Laemmle sold its music catalogue to Joe Morris, Inc., and Solman signed a new contract with Morris, continuing with that firm (though not exclusively) until the end of his career.‚ÄúMorris Buys Laemmle Catalogue,‚Äù The New York Clipper LIX:49 (January 20, 1912); Catalog of Copyright Entries ... Musical Compositions (Washington: Government Printing Office), 1911‚Äì35. Solman evidently remained on good terms with his children and his former wife. His son Curt (who took the surname Kremer) became a hotel and restaurant pianist; his daughter Lucille (also sometimes Kremer) wrote a small number of songs, some in partnership with her father. All the Kremers had moved to San Diego by 1913, and Solman made extended trips to Southern California in the summers of 1913 and 1914.San Diego City Directories, 1912‚Äì15; Catalog of Copyright Entries ...

Perhaps as a result of these, or perhaps through his connection with Laemmle, Solman began writing film scenarios and scripts in 1916, first for Fox and then for Bluebird.‚ÄúSolman a Scenario Writer,‚Äù The New York Clipper LXIV:39, p. 7; ‚ÄúBluebird‚Äôs Plans,‚Äù The Billboard 29:17, p. 79. In 1920 his exclusive contract with Joe Morris ended, and Solman began to place his songs with other publishers. Musical tastes were changing, and Solman became associated with ‚Äúold-time‚Äù music; he wrote fewer songs and placed more of them with outlying firms in Cleveland and Kansas City.‚ÄúSong Notes, The Billboard 35:6 (February 10, 1923), p. 21; Catalog of Copyright Entries ... Musical Compositions (Washington: Government Printing Office), 1920‚Äì29. A brief flurry of interest arose when an early song was used in a 1936 film, and the following year E. B. Marks promoted Solman‚Äôs final song, ‚ÄúTry Tappin‚Äô,‚Äù by announcing Solman‚Äôs ‚Äúreturn‚Äù to composing.‚ÄúMusic in New York City,‚Äù The Billboard 48:52 (December 26, 1936); ‚ÄúMusic Items,‚Äù The Billboard 49:25 (June 19, 1937), p. 13. Solman‚Äôs son Curt moved to New York in the mid-1930s, and Solman was living with him at the time of his death.‚ÄúAlfred Solman, 69, Song-hit Composer,‚Äù [obituary] The New York Times, November 24, 1937, p. 23. Composer Nearly all of Alfred Solman‚Äôs compositions are popular songs, but they range across several genres. Solman wrote scripts and skits, but he rarely wrote his own lyrics. His most enduring partnership was with Arthur J. Lamb, from 1904 until Lamb‚Äôs death in 1928; other noteworthy collaborators were Monroe H. Rosenfeld, Alfred Bryan, and Arthur Lange. His most enduring song was a comic novelty, ‚ÄúThe Bird on Nellie‚Äôs Hat‚Äù (lyrics by Lamb), published in 1906, interpolated in Eugene O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs Ah, Wilderness! in 1933, converted into a cartoon short in 1939, and featured in music-hall revivals in the 1960s. Similar songs are dotted through his career; indeed, his final publication, ‚ÄúTry Tappin‚Äô‚Äù (lyrics by his son, Curt Kremer), belongs to this genre. However, Solman was more celebrated for ‚Äúhigh-class‚Äù ballads, telling tales of love or absence and utilizing compound meters, long, arching lines, and chromatic harmonies.‚ÄúMusic,‚Äù The Billboard 20:20 (May 6, 1908), p. 14; ‚ÄúCold Type Review,‚Äù The Billboard 29:50 (December 15, 1917), p. 14. Among his greatest successes were ‚ÄúIf I Had a Thousand Lives to Live‚Äù and ‚ÄúMine‚Äù; with Lamb he produced a trio of notable ‚Äúbell‚Äù songs: ‚ÄúWhen the Bell in the Lighthouse Rings Ding Dong‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Sexton and the Bell,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBells of the Sea.‚Äù Songs of this type were well suited for early recordings; over fifty Solman titles (usually ‚Äúhigh-class‚Äù ballads) were issued by Edison and Victor alone in the first twenty years of the century by major artists like Henry Burr and Reinald Werrenrath. Ballads had some of the prestige associated with art song; but Solman‚Äôs aspirations were greater, at least in his early years. A 1908 profile described him as a ‚Äúcultured musician‚Äù who ‚Äúhas had little opportunity to write the class of music for which he is temperamentally suited.‚Äù‚ÄúAbout Interesting People,‚Äù The Music Trade Review XLV:11 (March 4, 1908), p, 25. At the turn of the century Solman did take on a few more ambitious projects, such as ‚ÄúThe Way of the Cross,‚Äù an extended sacred anthem for solo voice, and Daddy Longlegs, a collection of over twenty short songs designed for children to texts by James O‚ÄôDea, with illustrations by Edgar Keller. A final, quite large number of songs arose out of Solman‚Äôs lifelong fascination with theatre and film. His songs for Paris by Night (1904) included both ballads and novelties, and through the 1920s he contributed material to many shows and revues. When he became involved with film he wrote songs that could serve both as stage numbers and as film themes; ‚ÄúBells of the Sea,‚Äù for instance, was performed by Joseph Martel in a dramatic scene that led directly into the music for a feature film.‚Äú‚ÄòBells of the Sea‚Äô Featured,‚Äù The Music Trade Review LXXV:6 (August 5, 1922), p. 49. Solman was not a remarkable innovator, but he was productive and consistent. He was actively sought by music publishers, especially for sentimental ballads, until changing tastes in the 1920s relegated his music to an ‚Äúold-time‚Äù style.

Several other composers including Masayoshi Soken and Naoshi Mizuta contributed music for updates to the game. The music for the game's reboot, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, was primarily composed by Soken, who was the sound director for both releases of the game. Music from both releases of the game has been released in several albums, though no album contains music from both XIV and A Realm Reborn. A pair of mini-albums containing a handful of selected tracks from XIV, Final Fantasy XIV: Battle Tracks and Final Fantasy XIV: Field Tracks, were released by Square Enix in 2010 when XIV first launched. A soundtrack album titled Final Fantasy XIV - Eorzean Frontiers, containing most of the music that had been released by that point for XIV, was digitally released in 2012. A final soundtrack album for the original release of the game, Before Meteor: Final Fantasy XIV Original Soundtrack, was released in 2013 just before the launch of A Realm Reborn, and contains all of the music that was composed for XIV throughout its lifetime. The latest soundtrack album, Shadowbringers: Final Fantasy XIV Original Soundtrack, was released in 2019. This album contains the music for the third expansion, Shadowbringers, and music from the previous expansion, Stormblood, that was added to the game via patches after the release of that expansion's soundtrack. The soundtracks for both releases of the game were well received by critics. Uematsu's mix of orchestral and rock tracks for XIV were praised, though the delayed release of a full album drew criticism. Soken's work on A Realm Reborn, including both his original tracks as well as themes carried over from XIV and previous Final Fantasy games, were heavily praised by reviewers for the game. Music from the initial release of the game has been played in the international Distant Worlds Final Fantasy concert series, and books of sheet music for piano arrangements of music from the game have been produced. Creation and influence Composer Nobuo Uematsu in 2006 The massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) Final Fantasy XIV was released in two versions: the original (live between 2010 and 2012), and its remake (Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, live since 2013). The music for XIV was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, who was the lead composer for the first ten main Final Fantasy games and a contributor to the Final Fantasy XI and XII soundtracks. Over the two years that XIV was active, several updates were made to the game, which included additional music composed by Masayoshi Soken, Naoshi Mizuta, Tsuyoshi Sekito and Ryo Yamazaki. XIV was poorly received, and despite the updates, Square Enix decided to take the game offline for a time, and relaunch it with a new development team under a new name. Soken, the sound director for both releases, composed the soundtrack to A Realm Reborn. Prior to agreeing to create XIVs score, Uematsu had already planned to compose \\"Kimi ga Iru Kara\\", the theme song for Final Fantasy XIII. Wanting him to fully focus on XIV, Square Enix asked XIIIs main composer Masashi Hamauzu to write the song instead. Thus, XIII was the first main-series Final Fantasy game soundtrack to not include Uematsu's work. Despite XIV being an MMO and thus a new genre for him, Uematsu treated it as any other video game project. Compared to his previous work within the series, Uematsu had considerable creative freedom while composing the soundtrack, because the rest of the production team did not fully envision beforehand how the soundtrack would sound or fit into the game. Uematsu created a mixture of orchestral and rock pieces for the game's battle themes. There was a momentary crisis when he lost most of the data for his completed tracks and needed to hire a data recovery service. He worked as a freelance composer during the project for Square Enix, also composing the music for The Last Story, a game from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The game's theme song, \\"Answers\\", was sung by Susan Calloway. She was chosen by Uematsu, who had worked with her during the first Distant Worlds concert and was impressed by her singing abilities. For A Realm Reborn, Soken was the primary composer, in addition to reprising his XIV role as lead sound director. The primary goal given to the music team was to make the music true to the series. Naoki Yoshida, the game's producer and director, told Soken to \\"give [the team] something straightforward that anyone could identify as Final Fantasy, with an easy-to-understand, expressive orchestral sound\\". Soken focused primarily on creating the soundtrack rather than his sound director role. He often created new tracks due to requests from staff members. As the game was developed and released in a shorter timeframe than the original release, Soken and the sound team were given less than a year to create both the music and the various sound effects for the game world. According to Soken, it felt like \\"enough work for two full games in that time\\". Unlike the freedom given Uematsu for XIV, most of the tracks for A Realm Reborn had specific guidelines, though Soken was allowed to \\"do what [he liked]\\" for Titan's battle theme. Soken sang the vocal work for some tracks, such as the battle theme for Leviathan. Several themes and tracks from the original game were carried over both directly and as a part of new tracks in A Realm Reborn, including the original vocal theme. Soken also remixed pieces from earlier Final Fantasy games for use in special in-game events. Original release =Mini-albums= The mini-albums Final Fantasy XIV: Battle Tracks and Final Fantasy XIV: Field Tracks were the first releases of music from the game, and were published by Square Enix on September 29, 2010, a week after the game itself was released. They feature selected tracks from XIV. The music was composed by Uematsu and arranged by Tsutomu Narita. Kenichiro Fukui also helped arrange some of the pieces on the Field Tracks mini-album. Battle Tracks has nine pieces, and includes the game's opening theme, the boss theme \\"Nail of the Heavens\\", and Final Fantasy XIVs rendition of Uematsu's \\"Victory Fanfare\\". Field Tracks predominantly features the main themes for the game's countries Ul'dah, Gridania and Limsa Lominsa, along with other pieces of music heard during traveling, for a total of eight tracks. Each mini-album was accompanied by special liner notes by Uematsu describing his experiences writing music for the series, with particular reference to the first game. Patrick Gann of RPGFan termed the mini-albums as a good return work from Uematsu despite some of the unexpected battle tracks, though he questioned whether the discs themselves would be worth purchasing once a full soundtrack album was released. Jayson Napolitano of Original Sound Version was generally positive, and cited the composition of the battle themes as \\"a cross between The Black Mages and Uematsu's work on Lord of Vermilion\\". The more orchestral field tracks were also praised. Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online termed Field Tracks as \\"largely likeable\\", and appreciated Uematsu's use of rock music in Battle Tracks, though he disliked the strategy of releasing two incomplete mini-albums rather than a full soundtrack album. Both mini-albums sold well: Battle Tracks appeared at position #73 on the Japanese Oricon album charts for a week, while Field Tracks appeared at position #75 for that same week. =Eorzean Frontiers= Final Fantasy XIV - Eorzean Frontiers was the first full album of music from the game to be released. It was published by Square Enix on September 1, 2012 as a digital album through iTunes. The tracks include most of the music that had been released for the game at that point, including pieces that were present at the game's launch and some which were added later, including \\"Rise of the White Raven\\", the theme for Nael Van Darnus, and the themes for the Grand Companies of Eorzea. All of the tracks from the album were additionally released on the same date in a set of smaller digital mini-albums, also released through iTunes, titled Final Fantasy XIV Frontiers - Gridania, Ishgard, Limsa Lominsa, and Ul'dah. The majority of the music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, with additional pieces contributed by Masayoshi Soken, Naoshi Mizuta, Tsuyoshi Sekito, and Ryo Yamazaki. The 38 tracks of the album cover a duration of 3:14:24. Derek Heemsbergen of RPGFan reviewed the album as an \\"incredibly rich and diverse musical score\\", and felt that regardless of the reception to the game itself, that the soundtrack was worthy of a Final Fantasy game. Jayson Napolitano of Destructoid, in his review of the album, found that while there were many interesting tracks in the album and that the total length of more than three hours made the album a \\"good deal\\", that most of the tracks that he enjoyed the most were previously featured on the Final Fantasy XIV Battle Tracks and Field Tracks mini-albums. =Before Meteor= On August 14, 2013, two weeks before the release of A Realm Reborn, Square Enix published Before Meteor: Final Fantasy XIV Original Soundtrack, a full soundtrack album with all of the music composed for the original release of the game, which had shut down a year prior. The 104-track album was released on a single Blu-ray disc and included music lasting 6:05:51, with both the original music by Uematsu as well as the additional tracks composed by Mizuta, Yamazaki, Sekito, Soken, and Ai Yamashita during the game's run. The disc also included a remastered version of the \\"A New Beginning\\" trailer and a bonus download code for an in-game Dalamud Minion. The Blu-ray disc allowed purchasers to rip digital copies of the album on their Blu-ray devices to play without the disc. Emily McMillan of Video Game Music Online generally praised the music, praising some of the newer tracks and Uematsu's work on the more orchestral tracks. Her main criticisms were that some aspects seemed artificial and that the composers were playing safe with the themes and motifs used. Before Meteor appeared at position #11 on the Japanese Oricon album charts for its release week and remained in the charts for three weeks. A Realm Reborn =Original Soundtrack= Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn Original Soundtrack was released by Square Enix on March 21, 2014. It was released on a Blu-ray disc and features 119 tracks lasting 6:48:00, all composed by Masayoshi Soken. In addition to the tracks present in the initial launch of A Realm Reborn, the album also includes tracks used in the 2.1 patch, A Realm Awoken. Initial copies of the soundtrack also came with a special \\"Wind-up Bahamut\\" in-game pet. Soken composed all of the music of the game, as well as sound effects, in only eight months. Emily McMillan of Video Game Music Online, in her review of the album, termed it a \\"truly fantastic score\\", and said that it was superior to the music of the original version of the game. She felt that it was an excellent merging of the traditional Final Fantasy musical style with a modern orchestral score. Mike Salbato of RPGFan also praised the album saying that it was his favorite soundtrack album of 2014, and that he \\"can't recommend A Realm Reborns soundtrack highly enough\\". In addition to reviews of the album, within the context of the game the music has been well received. Kotakus Mike Fahey stated that the music was \\"wonderful, complex and satisfying\\". He often paused to remove the ambient and interface noises so as to hear it better. GamesRadars Adam Harshberger called it \\"a standout even amongst Final Fantasys storied heritage\\" while Digital Spys Mark Langshaw called it \\"a sonic feast ... that pays appropriate homage to the long-running RPG series\\". The soundtrack won Video Game Music Onlines 2013 Annual Game Music Awards in the Eastern category. A Realm Reborn appeared at position #10 on the Japanese Oricon album charts for its release week, and remained in the charts for eight weeks, selling over 21,900 copies. =From Astral to Umbral= Final Fantasy XIV: From Astral to Umbral - Band & Piano Arrangement Album is a Blu-ray album of rock and piano arrangements of music from A Realm Reborn. It features arrangements by Soken, GUNN, Keiko, and Nobuko Toda of pieces originally composed by Soken for the game, and was published by Square Enix on December 17, 2014. The first six tracks on the album are piano covers, performed by Keiko, of field and town themes from the game. The following six are rock covers by Soken's band The Primals of the musical themes from the game of the primals, powerful elemental creatures. The Blu-ray disc also features the original versions of the twelve tracks, videos of in-game scenes where the original music plays, as well as one secret track that needs a password to unlock. Some of the original tracks had not yet been released on an official album when Astral to Umbral was produced. In picking tracks to arrange for this album, Soken wanted to highlight the contrast between the two sides. He chose pieces that he originally composed on piano for the piano selections and on guitar for the rock selections.http://www.vgmonline.net/masayoshisokeninterview/ Mike Salbato of RPGFan reviewed the album and described it as \\"a great, if perhaps disjointed experience\\". He praised the high quality of the arrangements and performances, but questioned the grouping of the more gentle piano tracks alongside the heavy rock pieces. =Before the Fall= Before the Fall: Final Fantasy XIV Original Soundtrack is an album of music from four patches to Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. These were patches 2.2 through 2.5: \\"Through the Maelstrom\\", \\"Defenders of Eorzea\\", \\"Dreams of Ice\\", and \\"Before the Fall\\". The album was released by Square Enix on August 26, 2015 on Blu-ray, and includes all of the music that Soken composed for the updates, as well as several pieces for the updates written by Nobuo Uematsu, Naoshi Mizuta, and Ryo Yamazaki. Of the 61 tracks, 16 were previously released on other albums, primarily the Before Meteor album, and these tracks compose the majority of the non-Soken tracks. It sold around 14,500 copies. Christopher Huynh of Video Game Music Online held a mixed opinion of the album, which he criticized as \\"a rather mixed bag of tracks\\". He said that while some of the tracks were excellent, there were several poor pieces as well, and was disappointed in the repeated material. He ascribed the uneven quality of the album to a lack of an overriding theme to the music, which left it as a collection of disparate material. He also criticized the sound quality, believing that the use of a real orchestra would have helped the orchestral pieces. Heavensward Heavensward: Final Fantasy XIV Original Soundtrack is an album of music for the Heavensward expansion pack to A Realm Reborn. The album was released by Square Enix on February 24, 2016 on Blu-ray, and includes all of the music that Soken composed for the expansion and the 3.1 patch \\"As Goes Light, So Goes Darkness\\". A few of the 58 tracks on the album were composed by Yukiko Takada or Nobuo Uematsu, and the majority by Soken. Unlike the prior Before the Fall album, all of the music was new to the album, though 16 of the tracks were previously released in September through November 2015 as Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward -EP- Vol. 1. through 3. It sold over 10,600 copies. The album was well received by Emily McMillan of Video Game Music Online, who lauded the soundtrack's \\"brilliant, varied, and extraordinarily fun to hear\\" themes. She praised the unique atmosphere of the new expansion's music, as well as its integration into the overall game's soundscape. It was also well received by Mike Salbato of RPGFan, who claimed that in the soundtrack, \\"Uematsu, Soken and co. really got a chance to shine musically\\". He listed \\"Dragonsong\\" and \\"Heavensward\\" as the \\"backbone\\" of the album, as their themes were prevalent in many other pieces in the soundtrack. =Duality= Final Fantasy XIV: Duality ~Arrangement Album~ is a Blu-ray album of rock and piano arrangements of music from Heavensward. It features arrangements by Soken, GUNN, and Keiko of pieces originally composed by Soken for the game, and was published by Square Enix on December 7, 2016. Like From Astral to Umbral, it is split between piano and rock band covers; the first six tracks are piano covers, performed by Keiko, of field and town themes from the game, while the following seven are rock covers by Soken's band The Primals of the musical themes from the game of the primals. The final track on the album is an acoustic and vocal cover of Oblivion, which was a rock song in the original game. Mike Salbato of RPGFan reviewed the album and described it in similar terms to From Astral, the first arrangement album for the game. He praised the high quality of the arrangements and performances, but found the piano arrangements more interesting for their originality than the rock arrangements; unlike for the From Astral rock arrangements, many of the Duality arrangements were of rock or rock-inspired tracks, which he felt left the arrangements feeling superfluous. He concluded, however, that the piano arrangements and Oblivion cover made the album an \\"easy recommendation\\". =The Far Edge of Fate= A fifth album, composed of songs from Patch 3.2 through Patch 3.5, was released on 7 June 2017. It sold over 8,900 copies. Stormblood A sixth album, composed of songs from Patch 4.0 through Patch 4.3, was released on July 4, 2018. =Piano= A seventh album, an album of piano arrangements, Piano Collections Final Fantasy XIV, was released on March 6th, 2019. The 17-track album includes piano renditions of songs from throughout the game's soundtrack. Shadowbringers An eighth album, composed of songs from Patch 4.4 through Patch 5.05, was released on September 11, 2019.https://store.na.square-enix- games.com/en_US/product/570584/shadowbringers-final-fantasy-xiv-original- soundtrack-blu-ray Legacy Four tracks from Final Fantasy XIV (\\"Navigator's Glory\\", \\"Twilight Over Thanalan\\", \\"Primal Judgement\\", and an orchestral rendition of \\"Answers\\" with vocals by Susan Calloway) were included in the Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy Returning Home concert on November 6 and 7, 2010 in Tokyo, Japan, which was released as a CD-DVD package in 2011. Those four tracks along with \\"Beneath Bloodied Banners\\" were then added to the general setlist options for the international Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy concert tour. Tracks from A Realm Reborn were included in the Nintendo 3DS rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call. An 88-page book of sheet music for piano arrangements of songs from the soundtrack titled Final Fantasy XIV Piano Solo Sheet Music was published by Dream Music Factory in 2010, containing the tracks featured in the mini-albums. Dream Music Factory also published piano-arranged sheet music for Before Meteor in 2013 titled Before Meteor: Final Fantasy XIV Piano Solo Sheet Music. A series of concerts of music from Final Fantasy XIV began in 2017, titled Eorzean Symphony. The series began in September 2017 with a three-night set of concerts in Tokyo performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, led by conductor Hirofumi Kurita. It continued in June 2018 with another concert in Los Angeles and in then again in August in Dortmund, Germany. An album was released on December 20, 2017 containing music from the Tokyo concerts; a blu-ray release contains sixteen tracks as well as video from the concerts, while a CD release contains eight tracks.

Early life and education Russell was born into a sporting family. His father played a lot of racket sports, and worked in sports administration, including as Director of Domestic Rugby for the Scottish Rugby Union. His grandparents were international badminton players, his uncle and great- grandfather played cricket for Scotland and his brothers are also noted rugby players.https://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst4141.html He started playing rugby in Wallace High School in Stirling. Russell did not feel drawn to academic work. After secondary school, he pursued an apprenticeship for three years as a stonemason, in a business owned by a family friend, whilst his rugby developed.https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby- union/interview-finn-russell-his-rapid-career-rise-1497529 Playing career =Early years= Russell initially played rugby at Stirling County, but in 2011 moved to second-flight Falkirk to improve his chances of first XV club rugby. In 2012 he played at centre for Scotland at the World Rugby U20 Championships.https://www.sportsjoe.ie/rugby/finn-russell-interview-scotland- lions-gregor-townsend-211526 He was selected to play for Ayr after the IRB Championship tournament, helping them win the league and cup double in the 2012‚Äì13 season of the Scottish Premiership.Russell was drafted to Ayr in the Scottish Premiership for the 2017‚Äì18 season Pro-player scheme, which seeks to increase integration between the BT Premiership and the professional game. Russell joined Glasgow Warriors in 2012, but was injured in his first season. =Club= New Zealand In 2013, he received the John Macphail Scholarship, spending 15 weeks linked New Zealand's Lincoln University, in New Zealand's South Island playing for local clubs in the Christchurch area. He benefited from the state-of-the art facilities and specialist coaching offered by the Canterbury Rugby Football Union international high performance unit. During this time Russell was partnered with former Munster centre Jason Holland as a mentor. Russell has said \\"He helped me out and I got to know him quite well. We were aligned with the trainers but you never trained with them. You watched them train but you don‚Äôt interact with them that much. Although you could see how they go around their work and how they do their day-by-day, and things like that. As a young player it was quite good to learn from them. In terms of analysis and preparing for a game, that‚Äôs the first time I did anything like that. As a coach at the time, he would make me, during the week, get the game-plan for the team I was going to play at the weekend and then present it to the team and do all the stuff like that. That was the first time I had to do anything like that. For me, it was pretty different but it was quite good and it made me grow as a player. And playing on a different team with a different style of rugby was pretty good for me, as a young player.\\" Glasgow Warriors Russell returned to Glasgow for the 2013/14 season. With Glasgow's top players away on international duty for the 2013 Six Nations Championship, Russell was named on the bench to face Zebre on 10 February 2013 as part of the 2012‚Äì13 Pro12 season, coming onto the field and making his professional debut at the 56th minute of the game. During the 2013‚Äì14 Pro12 season, Russell made his first start at the club, starting at Inside Centre against the Newport Gwent Dragons at Scotstoun Stadium on 22 November 2013. Glasgow Warriors Head Coach Gregor Townsend offered Russell a full-time contract with the club that began in the 2014‚Äì15 season. 2014‚Äì15 also saw Russell play a prominent role in Glasgow Warriors' Pro12 title triumph. In the final match of the regular season, his personal points haul of 22 (including two tries) contributed to the bonus-point victory over Ulster needed to secure a home play-off. The following week, against the same opposition, Russell's extraordinary pass to D.T.H. van der Merwe in the 75th minute resulted in a touch down and tying the score at 14‚Äì14. Russell then stepped up to slot home the decisive conversion from a daunting position to send Glasgow into the Final. In the Final at Belfast's Ravenhill Stadium, Russell was again among the try scorers as Glasgow won their maiden title, also kicking four conversions in the 31‚Äì13 victory over Munster. Racing 92 On 29 November 2017, it was announced that Russell would leave Glasgow Warriors at the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season to play in France's Top 14 with Racing 92, where he was to replace All Blacks legend Dan Carter after the latter's move to Japan. =International career= Scotland Russell earned his first call-up to the senior national team during the team's summer 2014 tour of North America. That autumn, he started in all three of Scotland's November Tests against Argentina, New Zealand and Tonga. In 2014, Russell had what Scottish sportswriter Andy Newport called \\"a meteoric rise [that] saw the former Stirling County youngster blast his way into the national team in the space of six months.\\" Russell established himself as Scotland's first-choice Number 10 during the 2015 Six Nations Championship, starting four of the team's five matches. He missed the defeat to Italy through suspension, his sin-binning against Wales having been upgraded to a two-week ban following a citation (and unsuccessful appeal). Russell scored his first international try in the final day defeat to eventual champions Ireland. Russell was selected in Scotland's 31-man squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and scored a try in the team's opening match victory over Japan. The summer of 2017 began with Russell as part of Scotland's Southern Hemisphere tour. He created two tries in the opening match win over Italy in Singapore, and followed this with a try of his own a week later during victory over Australia. Russell played in all five of Scotland's 2018 Six Nations Championship fixtures. During the 25-13 victory over England, he threw an audacious pass on his own 22-yard line as part of an attack leading to a try scored by Sean Maitland. This piece of skill was subsequently described by many pundits as being one of the greatest of all- time.http://www.planetrugby.com/videos/finn-russell-greatest-pass-ever/ Russell played in four of Scotland's 2019 Six Nations Championship fixtures, missing the match against France due to injury. He scored a try and two conversions and played pivotal role in Scotland's come back against England to earn a 38-38 draw. Russell played in three of Scotland's group matches at the 2019 Rugby World Cup scoring a try in the loss to Japan, as Scotland failed to qualify to the quarter finals. British and Irish Lions Following an instrumental Man-of-the-Match performance for Scotland against Australia in Sydney, Russell was called up to the 2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. Russell made a brief mid-week appearance during the 31-31 draw with Super Rugby champions Hurricanes as replacement for Dan Biggar who had sustained a head injury, becoming Lion number #835. Barbarians In 2018, Finn Russell was capped with the Barbarians against England during the mid-year rugby tests. He scored 19 points (1 try and a 7/7 kicking conversions), allowing his team to beat England 45‚Äì63 at Twickenham. England had never conceded so many points in their stadium.

His book Chinese Writing is considered the \\"single most influential study of Chinese palaeography\\". Early life and education Qiu Xigui was born in July 1935 in Shanghai of Ningbo ancestry. In 1952 he was admitted to the history department of Fudan University, and was interested in pre-Qin dynasty Chinese history. Under the influence of the renowned oracle bones expert Hu Houxuan (), he took interest in the oracle bones and Chinese bronze inscriptions. After graduating in 1956, he became a graduate student of oracle bones and Shang dynasty history, studying under Professor Hu. The same year, Hu was transferred to the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, and Qiu followed Hu to the institute. Career After finishing his graduate studies in 1960, Qiu was assigned to be a teaching assistant in the Department of Chinese of Peking University (PKU). From 1964 to 1966, Qiu, like many other intellectuals, was sent to the countryside to be \\"reeducated by peasants\\" as part of Chairman Mao Zedong's Socialist Education Movement. He was sent to Jiangling County, Hubei and Yanqing County, Beijing. During the subsequent Cultural Revolution, he worked as a labourer at a farm in Jiangxi province from 1969 to 1971. In 1972, Qiu participated in the research of Han dynasty documents excavated from Mawangdui, under the leadership of Zhu Dexi. From 1974 to 1976, he worked under Zhu at the Wenwu (Cultural Relics) Publishing House, where they researched the Yinqueshan Han Slips and other excavated bamboo and wooden slips. He became an associate professor at PKU in 1978 and a full professor in 1983. From 1982 to 1983, Qiu taught Chinese palaeography at University of Washington in Seattle as a visiting scholar. From February to July 1998, he gave lectures on palaeography and ancient literature at the Chinese department of National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. In November 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Chicago. In 2005, Qiu returned to his alma mater Fudan University to lead its Center for Research on Chinese Excavated Classics and Palaeography. Publications Much of Qiu Xigui's research findings were published in his 1988 book Wenzixue Gaiyao (). According to American sinologist Edward L. Shaughnessy, the book is the \\"single most influential study of Chinese palaeography\\", and \\"universally acclaimed to be the definitive overview\\" of the field. It was translated into English by Gilbert L. Mattos and Jerry Norman, two leading Western scholars of Chinese linguistics, and published in 2000 under the title Chinese Writing. As of 2002, Qiu had published about 300 academic papers, some of which were included in his 1992 book Guwenzi Lunji (, \\"Collected Papers on Palaeography\\").

He was especially well known for his paintings of horses and dogs.  Life  He was the son of a \\"gentleman of independent means\\" who was interested in art. While he was still in the Gymnasium he sat in on classes at the Prussian Academy of Arts. In 1837, he entered the master class of horse painter Franz Kr√ºger and later worked in the studios of Carl Joseph Begas. He went to Paris in 1839, where he spent two months studying with Paul Delaroche and was influenced by the work of Horace Vernet. From 1840 to 1842, he lived in Italy. When he returned, he devoted himself primarily to paintings of hunters and animals. Over time, he concentrated more on horses; at rest, exercising, engaging in sports etc., but he continued to paint portraits of all sizes as well as historical paintings, lithographs, etchings, and even some small bronze animal sculptures. His student, Max Liebermann recalled how Steffeck would produce small horse-and- rider portraits, which he sold for six Friedrichsdor each and were taken home by customers while they were still wet. From the early 1850s, he was increasingly devoted to teaching. In 1859, he became a Professor at the Prussian Academy and, in 1880, was appointed Director of the Kunstakademie K√∂nigsberg. Among his best-known non-animal works are The Execution of Robert Blum in Brigittenau and a cycle of scenes from Prussian history for the Wilhelms-Gymnasium in K√∂nigsberg. He died suddenly, of a stroke, and is buried at the Franz√∂sischer Friedhof (French Cemetery) in Berlin.

Chalon of (left to right) Carlotta Grisi, Marie Taglioni, Lucille Grahn and Fanny Cerrito in Pas de Quatre, 1845 The important place of women in dance can be traced back to the very origins of civilization. Cave paintings, Egyptian frescos, Indian statuettes, ancient Greek and Roman art and records of court traditions in China and Japan all testify to the important role women played in ritual and religious dancing from the start. In the Middle Ages, what has become known as ballet had its beginnings in Italian court festivals when women frequently played the parts of men. It was however in late 17th-century France that the Paris Opera produced the first celebrated ballerinas. While women began to dominate the ballet scene in the 18th century, it was with the advent of Romantic ballet in the 19th century that they became the undisputed centre of attraction with stars playing the leading roles in the works of Marius Petipa, appearing in theatres across Europe from Milan's La Scala to the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. More recently, women have played a leading role in developing various forms of modern dance including flamenco and expressionist dance. History Women have always played a predominant role in dance, as can be seen from its earliest history until the emergence of formal dances in the 15th century which developed into ballet. =Antiquity= Cave paintings from as long ago as 6000 BC provide scenes of dancing women. Examples can be seen in the Addauta Cave near Palermo and in the Roca dels Moros in Catalonia. In Ancient Egypt, women performed ritual dances for religious ceremonies such as funerals, as illustrated by frescos on the pharaohs' tombs. The oldest records of organised dance and of professional female dancers come from Egypt. Especially in the Old Kingdom, women were organised into groups known as khener, apparently being joined by men only at a later stage. In the Indian subcontinent too, there is early evidence of dancing women, most notably a bronze statuette from Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley dating from around 2500 BC. While men's early participation in dancing rituals appears to have been connected to hunting and fighting, women's dance was above all related to fertility, both agricultural and human.

There are many examples of ancient Greek art from the 6th and 5th centuries BC depicting dancing women. The virgins of Delos danced in a circle to honour Apollo while Terpsichore was the Muse of dance. In the 6th century BC, the choros became a lasting feature of Greek theatre while women known as the Dyonysiac, frequently depicted on Greek vases, dance in frensy, celebrating Dionysus, the god of wine. In Ancient Rome, female singers and dancers performed in the annual celebrations of Isis which included mystery plays representing the resurrection of Osiris.

After David had returned from slaying Goliath, women came out singing and dancing. In the New Testament, Matthew tells the story of how Salome danced for Herod in order to be given the head of John the Baptist.

The chorus dances performed by women in the Zhou dynasty were known as xi. The ancient theatrical spectacles called baixi probably involved dancing girls in dresses with fluttering silk sleeves. Texts from the Spring and Autumn period (771‚Äì476 BC) contain descriptions of professional dancing girls while the Nishang Yuyi dance, created by the Emperor Li Longji (685‚Äì762), stages virgin women dancing as if in a magic world. In 12th-century Japan, the Shirabyoshi were famous for their dancing and poetry. One of the most famous was the court dancer Shizuka who appears in the Japanese literature of the period.

In France and Italy, chain and circular dances such as the carole, and the tresque were popular from the 4th to 14th centuries. They were usually danced in a closed circle with men and women interspersed and holding hands. In Italy, the lively saltarello from Naples became popular in the 14th and 15th centuries. Groups of courtesans dressed as men performed the dance at masquerades.

One of the early masters was Domenico da Piacenza (c. 1400‚Äì1470) who compiled a manual of dance: De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi. In France, too, professional dancing began to take shape when dancers performed for Henry III of France at Fontainebleau in the early 1580s. Further presentations were made for Louis XIII, who frequently took the main part himself. But it was, above all, during the reign of Louis XIV (1643‚Äì1715) that the foundations were laid for what became known as ballet. The king not only had the rules of dance written down but established the Acad√©mie Royale de Danse in 1661, which developed into today's Paris Opera Ballet. Many of the early ballets were created by the Italian- French composer Jean Baptiste Lully and the French choreographer Pierre Beauchamp, often assisted by Moli√®re. Initially, female parts in the early ballets were taken by young men; but, in 1681, a young woman known as Mademoiselle De Lafontaine danced in Lully's Le Triomphe de l'amour. She went on to be the leading ballerina in at least 18 other productions at the Paris Opera between 1681 and 1693, establishing the supreme importance of women in ballet. De Lafontaine was succeeded by Marie-Th√©r√®se de Subligny who became the first ballerina to perform in London when she appeared with Claude Ballon in 1699. Said to be the best ballerina of her day, with beautiful eyes and a fine figure, Subligny danced at the Paris Opera from 1688 until her retirement in 1707. The next leading dancer of the Op√©ra was Fran√ßoise Pr√©vost (1680‚Äì1741), whose precision, lightness and grace contributed much to classical ballet. She persuaded conductor Jean-F√©ry Rebel to compose suites specifically for ballet. His Caprice, Boutade, Les Caract√®res de la danse and La Terpsichore brought her considerable success. In particular, her personal interpretation of the steps in Caprice served as an example for other soloists while she transformed the Caract√®res into a sequence illustrating different types of lover, both male and female. Pr√©vost trained two highly successful dancers, Marie Camargo (1710‚Äì1770) and Marie Sall√© (1707‚Äì1756), who added their personal preferences to her Caract√®res, each developing individual styles. They would take her place as prima ballerinas after she retired from the opera in 1730. Camargo proved to be a tremendous success, not only as a result of her dazzling footwork (especially her entrechat √† quatre), but because she introduced slightly shorter skirts and new hair styles. She also discarded high-heeled shoes, introducing dancing slippers which facilitated the execution of the more demanding routines. By dancing demanding routines, which had previously been performed exclusively by men, Camargo further consolidated the image of the ballerina. Sall√© sought more from ballet than skillful demonstrations of technique as favoured by proponents of traditional ballet. She believed music, steps, decor and costumes should all contribute to a graceful, expressive performance combining pantomime with dance in what became known as ballet d'action. As many in the Paris Opera did not share her views, she decided to move to the more liberal London. At Covent Garden, she caused a sensation in 1734 as Galatea in Pygmalion, a ballet she had choreographed herself. Discarding the usual attire of a ballerina, she chose to wear a simple muslin tunic and allow her hair to fall freely over her shoulders. The following year, she even decided to dress as a man while performing the role of Cupid but the reviews were extremely critical. As a result, she returned to Paris where she danced at the Op√©ra until her retirement in 1740 at the young age of 33. Thereafter, she occasionally danced for the court at Versailles. During the second half of the 18th century, the dominating star of the Paris Opera was Marie-Madeleine Guimard who may not have had the technique of Sall√© but was nevertheless recognized for her sensuous movements, her numerous suitors and her exotic attire. Other stars included Marie Allard (1738‚Äì1802) who joined the Paris Opera in 1756 where she was trained by Ga√©tan Vestris, becoming not just an √©toile but also his wife. Although she was rather corpulent and frequently pregnant, she was acclaimed for her impressive footwork.

The Italian-Swedish Marie Taglioni (1804‚Äì1884) not only excelled at the Paris Opera when she danced La Sylphide in 1832 but extended her fame to Saint Petersburg's Mariinsky Ballet as well as to the stages of Berlin, Milan and London until her retirement in 1847. It was she who developed ballet's en pointe (dancing on the tips of the toes) while introducing new fashions in dress and hair styling which became popular throughout Europe. The Austrian Fanny Elssler (1810‚Äì1884) gained fame and fortune by dancing the flirtatious Spanish cachucha in Le Diable boiteux, performing not only in Austria, Germany, France, England and Russia but also in the United States. Nevertheless, in 1845 she refused to dance with her rivals Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny Cerrito, and Lucile Grahn in Jules Perrot's Pas de Quatre. Presented at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, the Pas de Quatre caused a sensation, bringing together the four greatest ballerinas of the day. In addition to Marie Taglioni, Italy's Grisi (1819‚Äì1899) had become famous both in Paris and Saint Petersburg for her Giselle, while Cerrito from Naples had become the star of La Scala in Milan. Grahn (1819‚Äì1907), a Dane trained by Bournonville, was based in Paris but had also danced in London, Saint Petersburg and Milan before settling in Germany.

Italian-born Virginia Zucchi (1849‚Äì1933) first danced in Italy and Germany but her interpretations of Marius Petipa's ballet in Russia were so successful that the Tzar insisted she should join the Mariinsky Ballet in Saint Petersburg. In the mid-1880s, she starred in Copp√©lia, La fille mal gard√©e and La Esmeralda, revolutionizing ballet in Russia through the extraordinary power of her performances. Pierina Legnani (1863‚Äì1930) from Milan followed as similar path, also dancing at the Mariinsky from 1892 where she originated famous roles in Petipa's ballets including Cinderella, Swan Lake and Raymonda, gaining the title of prima ballerina assoluta. Carlotta Brianza (1867‚Äì1930), also from Milan, first gained fame at La Scala with which she toured the United States. She is remembered above all for dancing Aurora at the premiere of Petipa's Sleeping Beauty in 1890.

One of the early stars was Anna Pavlova (1881‚Äì1931) who gained fame by dancing The Dying Swan choreographed by Mikhail Fokine before joining the Ballets Russes in 1909. Her rival, Tamara Karsavina (1885‚Äì1978), who also performed with the Ballets Russes, is remembered above all for creating the title role in Fokine's The Firebird. Olga Spessivtseva (1895‚Äì1991) danced with the Mariinsky in Saint Petersburg but also toured with the Ballets Russes, dancing Aurora in Diaghilev's The Sleeping Princess (1921) in London.

Polish-born Marie Rambert (1888‚Äì1982) who had also gained experience with the Ballets Russes founded the Ballet Club (later the Rambert Dance Company) in 1926 introducing new choreographers such as Frederick Ashton. Even more influential, Ninette de Valois (1898‚Äì2001) spent three years with the Ballets Russes before creating London's Vic-Wells Ballet in 1931 (later becoming the Royal Ballet) where Alicia Markova (1910‚Äì2004) was the first prima ballerina, starring in ballets from the Mariinsky's classical productions. Markova left to form her own touring company in 1937. Ten years later Margot Fonteyn (1919‚Äì1991) became the company's prima ballerina. The height of her fame came in 1961 when she embarked on a partnership with Rudolf Nureyev, first in Giselle, until she retired in 1979.

She danced as a soloist in George Balanchine's arrangements for Song of Norway in 1944. As Balanchine's wife, she soon became the star of the New York City Ballet. Lucia Chase (1897‚Äì1986) was a co-founder of the American Ballet Theatre in 1939 and became its artistic director for over 40 years, overseeing the production of a wide variety of new ballets. Several outstanding American ballerinas have emerged over the years including Gelsey Kirkland (born 1952), who performed the leading role in The Firebird when she was just 17, and Suzanne Farrell (born 1945) who was the star of Balanchine's Don Quixote in 1965.

While many of the singers who emerged in the 18th century were men, women increasingly gained fame as dancers. One of the earliest was Juana la Macarrona (1860‚Äì1947) who first performed in Seville with singer Silverio Franconetti but soon become popular not only throughout Spain but across Europe. Lola Flores (1923‚Äì1995) is remembered for singing and dancing Andalusian folklore, especially flamenco, copla and chotis. Angelita Vargas (born 1946) is considered to be one of the greatest stars of Andalusian flamenco dancing, touring Europe, the United States, Japan and Australia. =Modern dance in U.S= Led by women, various styles of modern dance began to develop towards the end of the 19th century. Loie Fuller (1862‚Äì1928) from Chicago was one of the pioneers. She employed her own natural approach to movement and improvisation, later becoming a star at the Folies Berg√®res in Paris. Inspired by Greek art, Isadora Duncan (1877‚Äì1927) from San Francisco paved the way to the modern free dance style believing it was more important to express the essence of life through movement rather than to follow the precepts of classical ballet. Raised on a farm in New Jersey, Ruth St. Denis (1879‚Äì1968) developed her own interpretations of Oriental dance as an expression of spiritualism. The American Martha Graham (1894‚Äì1991) exerted considerable influence on the development of modern dance through her New York-based Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance. Other female figures who contributed to developments in the mid-20th century include Doris Humphrey (1895‚Äì1958) who choreographed Afro-American spirituals and Helen Tamiris (1905‚Äì1966) who played an important part in choreographing early musicals. Another major choreographer of Broadway musicals was German-born Hanya Holm (1893‚Äì1992), a student of Mary Wigman.

Inspired by Oriental percussion, she often stressed the macabre. Hertha Feist (1896‚Äì1990), also from Germany, was an expressionist dancer and choreographer. She established her own school in Berlin, combining gymnastics with nudism and dance although her ambitions were later seriously curtailed by the Nazis. Also an associate of Wigman, Gret Palucca (1902‚Äì1993) opened her own schools in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s but they were later closed because of her Jewish ancestry. One of her students, Dore Hoyer (1911‚Äì1967), who was also an associate of Mary Wigman, developed her own programmes before the Second World War in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. After the war she became ballet director at the Hamburg State Opera.

Several of Egypt's film actresses performed belly dancing in the musicals of the 1930s and 1940s. Early stars included Tahia Carioca (1919‚Äì1999), Samia Gamal (1924‚Äì1994) and Nelly Mazloum (1929‚Äì2003). From the 1960s, belly dance became increasingly popular across the United States with stars including Dalilah (bellydancer) (1936‚Äì2001), Dahlena and Serena (1933‚Äì2007).

Most of them had no formal training, the exception being Cl√©o de M√©rode (1875‚Äì1966) who left the Paris Opera to perform at the Folies Berg√®re. The major choreographer was Algerian-born Mariquita (1830‚Äì1922) who became ballet director at the Folies Berg√®re and the Op√©ra Comique. Stars of the period included the Spanish La Belle Otero from Galicia who gained fame at Charles Franconi's Cirque d'√©t√© in 1890, √âmilienne d‚ÄôAlen√ßon (1869‚Äì1946) who danced at the Folies Berg√®re, and Dutch-born Mata Hari (1876‚Äì1917) who from 1905 became famous for her Indonesian-inspired temple dance, first in Paris and then in other European capitals.

While at Aggie, Barrett was a member of the Washington Irving Literary Society, a popular pastime among the undergraduates.

It played a prominent and influential role in the expansion of the Civil Rights Movement in Durham. Terry Sanford, its founder, managed to develop that through the help and involvement of the North Carolina Fund. A Member of the Democratic Party, Sanford was the former governor of North Carolina and was highly respected for his intervention in the improvement of public education. Indeed, in the 1960s, the education system in place in North Carolina was very poor as one quarter of the adults above 25 years old had received an education inferior to sixth grade, making most of them illiterate.2 Because of the high success of the program, the concept developed through the North Carolina Fund was mimicked throughout the nation, transforming what initially was a state wide program to a national program. Throughout this movement, activism played a fundamental role as the main aim of the program consisted in changing the economic situation of a state through the use of political and social power.  History  = Economic Situation of Durham in the 1960s = In the mid-20th century, Durham's economic situation was not as idyllic as people might have thought. Indeed, Durham was a very unequal town and huge disparities among the citizens existed. Equality and civil rights had been promised to the United States after a decade of intense activism4, but all of this without success. According to the data (Exhibit A) compiled by the Action for Durham Development, by the 1960s there were 5,215 families out of 18,690 that had an overall income of less than $3000 per year‚Äîapproximately 28% of the families in Durham were in poverty. This represented a considerable number of families that were impoverished. Furthermore, many of citizens of Durham, both rich and poor, began to leave the city to seek better job opportunities and to escape from poverty: \\"In the [1960s], the number [of citizens out-migrating] fell to 30,000‚Ä¶ continuing loss‚Ä¶ of 6-10 percent of young adults between the ages of twenty and thirty-five.\\" Consequently the constant loss of youths from Durham‚Äîand from North Carolina‚Äîresulted in a decreasing economy due to \\"costs of lost productivity, of lost purchasing power, and of the relief rolls.\\"James LeLoudis, \\"Leadership and politics in the war on poverty: the case of the North Carolina Fund,\\" Popular Government (Spring-Summer 2003): 2-13. Much of Durham's economic decline was due to the rapid industrialization of the tobacco and textile industries following World War II. While these industries had once supplied plentiful jobs to Durham, new advances in mechanized production resulted in the cutting of significant numbers of jobs after the 1940s.Jean Anderson, Durham County: A History of Durham, North Carolina (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2011), 349-351. Durham was going through economic instability due to the rapid industrialization that was occurring. Although industrialization made production easier and quicker, jobs were lost as they were replaced with machines. Soon, these economic issues gave birth to variety of new issues that further affected the welfare of the citizens of Durham. Governor Terry Sanford wished to take a shift of direction and create integration opportunities for the population of Durham. In 1963, he created the North Carolina Fund, which relied on a five-year plan to put an end to segregation and economic discrimination.6 Even though poverty had been an issue for a long period of time, it had not been acknowledged. Indeed, because of high emigration rates that were due to the slowing down of the industrial revolution effects, as well as the decline of agricultural job opportunities, the rate of growth in the 1960s was dropping, therefore rising the level of poverty throughout the state of North Carolina, and Durham especially because of the development of the tobacco industry.8 By creating the North Carolina Fund, Sanford was exploring opportunities to enable the local population to be part of the working force in an evolving society. = The relation between race and poverty = The link between race and poverty was first acknowledged by Sanford in 1961 when he realized that many African-American factory workers were paid less than minimal wage, about half of the students dropped out of high school without having obtained a high school diploma, and most of the adults were illiterate.9 Seeing how alarming the situation was in the state of North Carolina, the governor realized that he was facing a pressing issue that was not only affecting the African-American community of Durham, but that was also blocking the economic growth and spread of the industries found in that region. Most of the recipients of the program were African Americans, but it was not exclusively directed towards them, which served as an incentive for the general population to accept it. Even though the level of white poverty was a lot lower, Operation Breakthrough was still helpful to them. It was also a way to emphasize that poverty affected the general population, and not only one ethnic group, which overall served as a great marketing strategy. Even though Operation Breakthrough engaged itself in some civil rights work, it was not considered to be a civil right organization. The Black community started to discover that they could have a voice in their community, and decided to fight for their rights and better living conditions. People started to request that their basic needs were met, just like Ann Atwater did, with the support of Howard Fuller, when she finally decided to go talk to her landlord to demand reparations in her house. She then was recruited as a supervisor for neighborhood workers for the Operation Breakthrough program as well as declared head of the Housing Committee for United Organizations.11 She was strongly involved in the Civil Rights Movement. Seeing the success Operation Breakthrough had in North Carolina, the program was then extended to different states, being modified to respond to the needs of different communities. = The emergence of the North Carolina Fund = The program was initially started as thousands of families were far below the poverty line and were not even sure of what they would be able to get on a daily basis. This pioneering program was to be designed and implemented by local communities who would best be able to target the needs of the lower-class population.13 The fund relied not only on providing economic support but depended greatly on the social and political collaboration. With the creation of the North Carolina Fund, the state was initiating an \\"all out assault on poverty.\\"14 This non-profit corporation was a precursor to the creation of future similar organizations, aiming to address the long, and still processing, war on poverty.15 The lack of opportunities for the minorities reinforced the poverty cycle. As Sanford said, the North Carolina Fund was going to be the \\"first massive statewide effort in our country to find ways to break the cycle of poverty and dependency.\\"16 One of the first focuses was education. Through the intensification of schooling methods, citizens were becoming more prone to find jobs as well as more self-reliable. However this was not sufficient. As Sanford said, \\"A child who goes to school with no breakfast under his belt does not have equal opportunity to learn, excel, and move toward adulthood in which he will be able to use his talents and energies and intellect in a self- respecting role in society.\\"17 It was therefore necessary not only to sustain the education of a child but also to provide resources to his family, both educationally and on a more basic level such as providing the essential living resources. Terry Sanford worked with his aides to convince the Ford Foundation to invest in their anti-poverty plan: \\"In early 1963, as Sanford's team continued their efforts to convince the Ford Foundation that North Carolina was the right place to launch a new anti-poverty initiative, they turned for assistance not to lawmakers in Raleigh but to wealthy white philanthropists in Winston-Salem and black power brokers in Durham.\\" Through many years of diligence, Sanford was successful in attaining money to begin an anti-poverty initiative: \\"In July 1963, Ford president Henry Heald and members of his staff made their last pre-grant visit to North Carolina‚Ä¶[The Ford Foundation] called on Wheeler and asked for his frank assessment of Sanford's plans for battling poverty‚Ä¶Heald assured Sanford that Ford would commit $7 million to a statewide antipoverty campaign.\\"Korstad, Robert Rodgers, Billy E. Barnes, and James L. Leloudis. To Right These Wrongs : The North Carolina Fund and the Battle to End Poverty and Inequality in 1960s America (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010), 79-82. = Origins of Operation Breakthrough = The program was established to end the cycle of poverty in Durham. The city was impoverished and victim of a segregationist movement. Inequalities resulted from these two issues. Operation Breakthrough strives to eliminate poverty throughout the city while also empowering the low-income population who are often under represented and unheard in the society. To achieve these goals, activist movements were pursued, and educational and vocational training were provided to anyone in need. For the program to be effective, officials decided the initial and most urgent target had to be Durham youth, as they represented the future generations of Durham and therefore the economic development and sustainability depended on them and their education. The program focused, therefore, on access to education. With financial support (for food and education) from various funds, the youth were able to complete their high school education. They also had the opportunity to develop working skills to prepare them for the work force. Initial funding was through the Office of Economic Opportunity and the North Carolina Fund.19 After achieving the initial goal of reaching out to the youth, the program extended its targets to adults, to provide them with job opportunities and access to day care. To make communications more effective, the Neighborhood Advisory Council20 was formed and they endorsed the role of representatives of the communities of individuals. Indeed, one of the main innovations of that program was the direct incorporation of members of the community in the decision comity: a representative was elected from the lower-class population to sit on the Operation Breakthrough Board of Directors.21 To represent the minority of African-Americans, Howard Fuller, a black activist, was elected to be the coordinator of the program in the community. Born in Louisiana in 1941, Fuller was one of the few African-Americans to have received access to a higher education. Because of that, he was hired by Operation Breakthrough in 1965 and was recognized as the leader of the black community to help in the coordination of the program. Furthermore, he acknowledged that influencing the black community as a whole was far more important than \\"simply recruiting black representatives for the Operation Breakthrough board of directors.\\"22 Because of his many interventions in the movement against poverty, he was perceived as \\"Black Jesus\\" by the lower-class African-American citizens. He became the public face of Operation Breakthrough, as well as the most important black activist in the city of Durham.24 . Composed initially of a group of nine people, Operation Breakthrough then developed into a more important and influential non-profit organization, striving successfully to influence people's lives in a positive way by responding to their basic needs. One of the important points to underline is that most of the members of the council were white and wealthy. For that reason, it was fundamental to put some members of the lower class on the council so they would be represented and acknowledged. Durham's local government was deeply involved, as the mayor of the time, R. Wense Grabarek, was one of the original incorporators.25 = The North Carolina Fund and Operation Breakthrough = The collaboration between the North Carolina Fund and Operation Breakthrough (OB) started in 1964, at the very beginning of OB. The aim of that collaboration was to create slowly a city that would be able to sustain itself economically. Indeed, the North Carolina Fund represented one of the key supporters of OB and help for the implementation of the different goals. Reaching that goal required more job opportunities and better state funding. To assure program success, people directly affected by the consequences of poverty and segregation were put on the board to represent the voices of minorities. Howard Fuller27, a black activist, was elected to be the coordinator of the program in the community.  Evolution  = Concentrated New Employment Program = Seeing the success the program had, more and more people were willing to invest into it and Operation Breakthrough gained more and more sponsors, upon which we could find civic groups, different businesses, as well as churches. To pursue the goal of providing a more stable socio-economic situation for the lower class of the population, the Concentrated New Employment Program was created. 2,966,438 dollars were brought to sustain such a development and assure the feasibility of the program. = Health, Education, and Welfare = A huge emphasis was put on education and how to support the evolution of children in Durham, as they represented the future of the city. Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)28, a program that was part of the Federal Government, supported financially and promoted the creation of a Head Start Summer Program, which later grew and evolved into becoming a Full Year Head Start Program.29 Not only was it directed to education, but it also supported the education of adults and provided job opportunities for day care support, and for volunteers to help to development and growth of the program. A program such as HEW shows the support that Operation Breakthrough received from the Federal government. Indeed, \\"Operation Breakthrough's reliance on federal funds offered a way of undermining the poverty agency's ability to organize and mobilize poor blacks.\\"30 = Support and Development = Operation Breakthrough also brought very strong support to the public workers by accompanying them in their working environment, creating regulations for the minimum wages they were allowed to receive. They were also provided with various training sessions, that would not only enhance their chances in finding a job but that would also simply provide them more tools that could open opportunities for them in life. In 1967, to further reinforce the positive developments of Operation Breakthrough, New Careers was founded.31 This program focused on improving various aspects of the community, which would strongly ameliorate the local individuals' daily lives. The whole program focused not only on improving the socio-economic condition of the community, but also strove for a cultural and physical impact to make the population more flexible and able to access different career types. Furthermore, various volunteer programs and services were offered such as the CASH recreation program. This program offered a choice of various activities as well as recreational facilities for rainy days in the summer. This also helped parents work without worrying about child care, so they could earn a steady income for their family.  Legacy of the program  Overall, the program puts a light on the economic situation of Durham. Indeed, because of the flourishing of the tobacco industry, it appears hard to picture Durham devastated by poverty and as a segregated city. The facilities developed by the help of Operation Breakthrough still remain prominent actors for the flourishing of Durham as an independent and growing city. The Head Start's Child Development Center32 was opened on November 18, 2004 and helped provide a high standard education for children, as well as educate parents on how to have a positive impact on their family. This program not only helps sustain families but it also provides help to children with disabilities, through the establishment of a personalized study plan that responds to his or her needs. Furthermore, it collaborates with the Durham Public Schools33 to transition from this specific program to integration into public schools as smoothly as possible. During his war on poverty, Johnson highly inspired himself from the non-profit North Carolina Fund program34. Indeed, the program served as a template for Johnson's intervention to end the cycle of poverty that reigned in America. To do so, Johnson said that the initial targets had to be focused on education and health care, which were similar examples to the North Carolina Fund and Operation Breakthrough.

It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival; it won the Grand Prix. Plot Gelsomina and her three younger sisters live with their parents on an Italian farm. As the eldest, she takes on a heavier burden, taking care of her sisters and assisting her father, Wolfgang with beekeeping. One evening, as the family is playing on the beach, they are told to be quieter and discover that a TV show is being filmed nearby. They watch and, as they are about to leave, the star, Milly, calls them over and gives Gelsomina a hair clip. Watching the program on TV, Gelsomina learns that it is launching a competition called Countryside Wonders, in which seven farmers will compete to have their products featured. While her father is strongly against participating, her mother warms to the idea, even though the quality of their honey is not great. Meanwhile, Wolfgang hires a juvenile delinquent named Martin to help with honey production. Martin never talks. Though Wolfgang tries to help Martin, he discovers that he is ineffectual. Unbeknownst to her father, Gelsomina applies on behalf of her family. She forgets about it after her father's old friend comes to stay. Later, left alone by their parents, while switching out the honeycombs to put in the processor, she accidentally injures one of her sisters, Marinella. At the hospital, while Marinella is being stitched up, Gelsomina realizes that Martin forgot to change the bucket which collects the processed honey and, on returning home, they find honey spilled over the floor. At the same time, they are visited by a man from the competition to inspect their production room. The children clean the work area and they are accepted. However, Wolfgang is infuriated by the news. Nevertheless, the family competes on the show, where they are dressed in ridiculous garb and must plead their case to the judges. On TV, Wolfgang freezes and cannot explain what makes his honey so special. However, Gelsomina steps up and, with Martin, performs a trick in which he whistles and bees crawl out of her mouth onto her face. The family loses the competition, however. Martin runs away and Gelsomina follows him but cannot find him. On the last boat ride back from the island, she finds herself alone with Milly, who takes off her wig and gives Gelsomina a hairpin. Gelsomina swims back to the island and finds Martin, but returns to her family without him. Because they lost the competition and have no money, the family is forced to leave the farm. Before they go, they discuss leaving something behind under the floorboards for someone else to discover.

Merrie Melodies animated cartoon directed by Arthur Davis. The short was released on June 26, 1948. In this short, a frustrated rooster attempts to catch a precocious worm. However, the tables turn when the rooster finds himself being chased by an amorous female rattlesnake. Plot After reading about the \\"early bird getting the worm\\", a frustrated rooster attempts to beat his fellow fowls to the punch, but winds up being late for breakfast anyway. The only meal left is a precocious worm with a mischievous attitude who delights in teasing and tormenting the hungry rooster. The rooster makes several bids to catch his prey, but the worm's pranks get the better of him each time (getting electrocuted, drenched with a hose, launched from a bazooka and so on). Eventually, the worm scares the rooster off by wrapping a baby's rattle around his tail and masquerading as a rattlesnake. His disguise inadvertently attracts the attention of an amorous female rattlesnake who captures him in her coils and proceeds to woo and kiss the terrified worm. The rooster, realizing that the worm was in disguise, tries to grab him, but ends up seizing the female rattlesnake by mistake (who misinterprets his embrace for romantic intent). The female rattlesnake chases both the worm and the rooster, who in turn team up to stop her advances. Using a pair of precisely driven golf balls, they pin her in the knothole of a wooden fence. The rooster attempts to turn on the worm following their partnership, only to have the worm use the same golf ball trick to trap him in the fence right next to the female rattlesnake. Seeing only his elongated neck and head, the female rattlesnake mistakes the trembling rooster for a male snake and begins batting her eyelids at him flirtatiously.

He made his MLB debut in 2015. After a rough 2016 season, he broke out as one of the league's best pitchers in 2017, being named an All-Star and finishing third in the American League Cy Young Award vote. He was also named an All-Star in 2018. He missed most of the 2019 season and all of the (COVID-19)shortened 2020 season due to shoulder injuries. Career =Minor leagues= Severino signed with the New York Yankees as an international free agent on December 26, 2011, agreeing on a $225,000 signing bonus. He had agreed to terms to sign with the Colorado Rockies, but a Yankees scout matched their offer and convinced Severino to play for the team he had grown up as a fan of. At the time, he could throw his fastball at . He made his professional debut for the Dominican Summer League (DSL) Yankees 1 that year. He started 14 games, pitching to a 4‚Äì2 win-loss record with a 1.68 earned run average (ERA) and 45 strikeouts in innings. He started 2013 with the DSL Yankees 1 and was promoted to the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League during the season. He finished 4‚Äì2 with a 2.45 ERA, 53 strikeouts over 44 innings in 10 games (eight starts). His fastball velocity reached at Charleston. Severino pitching for the Trenton Thunder in 2014 Prior to the 2014 season, Baseball America ranked him as the Yankees ninth-best prospect. Severino started the season with Charleston before being promoted to the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. After his promotion to Tampa, he was selected to appear in the 2014 All-Star Futures Game in July. After the Futures Game, he was again promoted, to the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League. Combined between the three teams, Severino went 6‚Äì5 win-loss record with a 2.46 ERA, 127 strikeouts, and 27 walks in 24 games (all starts) and 113 innings pitched. Before the start of the 2015 season, Severino was ranked the best prospect in the Yankees farm system and the 23rd best out of all minor league players by MLB Pipeline. He was ranked 35th by Baseball America. Severino began the 2015 season with Trenton, where he had a 2‚Äì2 win-loss record with a 3.32 ERA and 48 strikeouts in 38 innings pitched across eight games started. He received a promotion to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League, where he worked with RailRiders' pitching coach Scott Aldred to improve his pitching delivery. Severino pitched to a 7‚Äì0 win-loss record and a 1.91 ERA in 11 games started for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre through the end of July. With the Yankees in the postseason race, the Yankees made Severino unavailable in trade discussions for pitchers David Price, Cole Hamels, and Johnny Cueto at the MLB trade deadline of July 31. =New York Yankees= 2015 With a late-July injury to Michael Pineda, and the Yankees not acquiring a starting pitcher before the trade deadline, Brian Cashman, the general manager of the Yankees, announced that Severino's next start would come in the major leagues against the Boston Red Sox, the primary rival of the Yankees, at Yankee Stadium. Though Severino set a career-high with 113 innings pitched in the 2014 season, Cashman said that Severino would not be limited in how many innings he throws over the remainder of the 2015 season, in part because they limited his innings earlier in the season. Yankees' manager Joe Girardi set Severino's major league debut for August 5. Severino pitched five innings in his debut, allowing two hits, two runs (one earned), with seven strikeouts and no walks. At age 21, he was the youngest pitcher to make a start in the 2015 MLB season. Additionally, he became the first AL pitcher in MLB history to strike out seven hitters while walking none and allowing no more than two hits in their major league debut. He ended his rookie season having started 11 games, pitching innings with a 5‚Äì3 record, 2.89 ERA and 56 strikeouts. 2016 Severino began the 2016 season in the Yankees starting rotation. In a game against the Chicago White Sox on May 13, 2016, Severino left the game with an apparent injury after giving up 7 runs in 2.2 innings. The next day, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to right triceps inflammation. On May 30, 2016, he was activated from the disabled list, and optioned to the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. He was called back up on July 25 and was primarily used as a reliever for the remainder of the season. On September 26, Severino was ejected for the first time in his Major League career after hitting Justin Smoak with a pitch. This followed after he hit Josh Donaldson on the elbow and Blue Jays starter J.A. Happ hit Chase Headley with a pitch in the first inning. Severino finished the 2016 season with a 3‚Äì8 record and an ERA of 5.83. In his 11 starts, he went 0‚Äì8 with an 8.50 ERA and 1.78 WHIP. However, in his 11 relief appearances, he went 3‚Äì0 with a 0.39 ERA and 0.77 WHIP. 2017 Following Spring Training, Severino was named the Yankees fourth starter. On April 13, 2017, Severino struck out a career-high 11 batters in seven innings as the Yankees won 3‚Äì2 over the Tampa Bay Rays. In his following start, Severino struck out 10 batters in a career-high eight innings in a 4‚Äì1 loss to the Chicago White Sox. On April 26, Severino pitched seven shutout innings against the Boston Red Sox. On May 24, Severino pitched eight shutout innings against the Kansas City Royals. As of June 10, he had a 5‚Äì2 record with a 2.75 ERA. In a no-decision, he struck out a career-high 12 batters in seven innings against the White Sox on June 27 as the bullpen blew a lead for the sixth time in Severino's starts. Despite his strong start, Severino struggled to end the first half, allowing 16 earned runs in four starts from June 15 to July 2, for a 7.03 ERA in that span. He finished his first half on a high note though, striking out 10 batters over seven innings of three-run ball against the Milwaukee Brewers on July 8, his fourth start of the season with at least 10 strikeouts. Severino was named to the American League All-Star team alongside his teammates Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez, Starlin Castro and Dellin Betances. In the first half of the season, he had posted a 5‚Äì4 record with a 3.54 ERA and 124 strikeouts in 106‚Öì innings. His 10.50 strikeout per-9 ratio ranked in the top five of the American League. Severino started the second half strong, first matching Chris Sale by allowing one run over seven innings in a pitcher's duel against the Red Sox. In his next start, he fired seven shutout innings against the Seattle Mariners and then allowed zero earned runs in seven innings against the Cincinnati Reds. As of July 27, Severino was tied with Max Scherzer for second-most starts (8) of at least seven innings pitched with one earned run or less in the 2017 season, behind Clayton Kershaw's 11. On August 17, 2017, Severino collected his first Major League hit off Steven Matz against the New York Mets. He collected his 11th win holding the Detroit Tigers to one earned run over 6‚Öî innings with eight strikeouts on August 23. On September 3, against the Boston Red Sox, Severino struck out his 200th batter of the season, becoming the second- youngest Yankee in franchise history with 200 strikeouts in one season behind Al Downing in 1964. In the second half of the season, he went 9‚Äì2 with a 2.28 ERA in 14 starts, allowing no more than one earned run in ten of those starts. Severino ended the season having thrown a career-high innings in 31 starts, with a 14‚Äì6 record, 2.98 ERA, 1.04 WHIP, .208 opponent batting average, 5.3 bWAR, 5.7 fWAR and 230 strikeouts, tied with CC Sabathia for the third-most single-season strikeouts in Yankees history, and the most strikeouts in a single season by a right-handed pitcher in Yankees history in the Modern Era (post 1920). He also became the first Yankee starter to qualify for the ERA title with a sub-3.00 ERA since David Cone and Andy Pettitte both did so in 1997 and the youngest Yankee starter to do so since Dave Righetti in 1981. His 16 starts of one run allowed or less led the major leagues, additionally he was the first Yankee starter to have 16 starts with one or no runs allowed in a single season since Mike Mussina in 2001 and the youngest pitcher in the major leagues to reach this mark since Dwight Gooden in 1985.

CPS was established in Berlin- Copenhagen in 2004 by artists Khaled Ramadan, Alfredo Crammerotti and Stine Hoxbroe. The collective network of artists, curators and writers managed to providing a platform for the kind of artistic expression that goes beyond what is recognized on the global art scene. In 2005-06 CPS started it first experimental TV broadcast on tv-tv / Copenhagen Channel. Tv-tv group inherited the TV Stop station from a group of political activists who established the channel in 1989. https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_STOP Up to the closing of tv-tv in 2010 members of CPS collective has produced more than 55 programs about 200 hours of TV documentaries addressing the consequence of socio- political developments around the world and the withdrawal of a silent intellectual majority from the social spectrum into the narrow passages of academia. Projects curated by CPS Manifesta 8 The European Biennial, Spain Manifesta, the European Biennial of Contemporary Art, is known to be as Europe only roving, contemporary art event, showcasing the most innovative work by artists and curators from around the world. Manifesta an early 1990s Dutch initiative took shape as the International Foundation Manifesta (IFM), an independent and not-for-profit organisation with offices in Amsterdam. In 2010 CPS co-curated the Manifesta 8 in Murcia, Spain under the theme of the Rest is History. CPS aimed at specific way to curate the project, to make use of the location and its particular reality, not merely to utilise it for site- specific projects but rather to integrate the sites into the broader artistic project as a resource of intellectual capital to provide all participants with an ample opportunity for research and innovation as according to curators Khaled Ramadan and Alfredo Cramerotti. http://www.chamberarchive.org/blog/category/biennials/manifesta/ The 3rd Guangzhou Triennial, China The Middle East Video Channel ‚ÄòThe Middle East Channel‚Äô at ‚ÄòFarewell to Colonialism‚Äô was CPS contribution to the 3rd Guangzhou Triennial.

He was acclaimed leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador on April 17, 2014, and was slated to be sworn in as the 12th Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, but he announced on June 16, 2014 that he was quitting politics before actually assuming either position.\\"Set to become Newfoundland premier, Frank Coleman abruptly quits politics\\". The Globe and Mail, June 16, 2014. Background Coleman was born in Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador in 1953. He is the eldest of eight children, three boys and five girls, born to Eugene and Lorraine Coleman. His father was the second generation owner of Colemans retail business, which operated grocery and furniture stores. During his youth Coleman would work in the family business, from sweeping floors, to stocking shelves and selling furniture. He also spent one summer selling newspaper subscriptions, and another two summers working in the City of Corner Brook economic development office. As well, Coleman set up a small business selling advertising for a project he was working on. Coleman moved to Nova Scotia to receive his post-secondary education. He first earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at St. Francis Xavier University, before receiving his Masters of Economics from Dalhousie University. It was during his final months in university that he met his future wife Yvonne Hennebury, a nurse originally from St. John's. A year after they began dating the couple were married. The two decided they wanted to have a big family, so after Yvonne gave birth to their second child she left nursing to be a stay-at-home mother. The two had seven children in total; Eugene, Anna Claire, Maggie, Janet, Aidan, Maria and Yvette. Coleman began is career as an economist with Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro in St. John's. He applied for the job while still living in Halifax, and he could not afford to travel to St. John's for the interview. He managed to secure funds to travel to St. John's through the Unemployment office after verifying the interview with them, an act which helped secure him the job. After nearly eight years with Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, Coleman began teaching night classes at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN). As well he started a company selling satellite dishes as well as a consulting company. In 1983, he resigned from his job with Hydro to become a full-time private consultant. As a consultant he did environmental impact studies for the Hibernia oil field, did work for Sealand Helicopters and some work in agriculture. He later returned to the family business and within 60 months was president and chief executive officer of the Coleman Group of Companies. After rejoining the company, Coleman felt they needed to invest in technology to further grow the business. In 2010, the company‚Äôs technology investment had grown into a Point of Sale business intelligence software. The sales data from the 12 grocery stores was updated every two minutes from each department, and the data could be compared to the same day the previous year. Complete sales and gross profit reports are available each week to be reviewed by management. Atlantic Business Magazine has recognized Colemans as one of Canada‚Äôs 50 best- managed companies, and in 2010 Coleman himself was named CEO of the Year by the magazine. Coleman along with his cousin Mike Coleman were named recipients of the Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers (CFIG) 2013 Life Member Designation. He was also president and chief executive officer of Humber Valley Paving and Humber Valley Asphalt and Aggregates. In 2012, Coleman was appointed to the Board of Directors of Emera Newfoundland & Labrador Holdings Inc. The company is a subsidiary of Emera Inc., which is tasked with the design and construction of the Maritime Link portion of the Muskrat Falls hydro project. He resigned is position when he entered provincial politics. He has served on numerous other boards including, Newfoundland Power, Fisher Institute of Applied Arts and Technology, Immaculate Heart of Mary private Catholic School, Council for Canadian Unity, Rocky Mountain Liquor Corporation, The North West Company, Fishery Products International, United Grocers Inc. and Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors. 2014 leadership election In February 2014, there were reports that Coleman was interested in entering politics by seeking the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador (PC Party). The new leader of the party would subsequently be sworn in as the province's 12th premier. The position became vacant on January 24, 2014, when Kathy Dunderdale stepped down as leader and as Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, handing over the posts to Tom Marshall on an interim basis. Despite being relatively unknown throughout the province Coleman was quickly perceived as the frontrunner in the race when it was believed that former premier Danny Williams had courted him to run. On March 14, 2014, Coleman filed his nomination papers joining Bill Barry and Wayne Bennett in the leadership race. At his campaign launch Coleman denied being courted by Williams and said that while he reached out to the former premier he had considered entering politics for several years. A public opinion poll conducted in March 2014, showed that Coleman was the overwhelming favourite of the general public to be the next PC Party leader. 38 percent of those polled thought Coleman was the best choice for leader, compared to 14 percent who chose Barry and eight percent who chose Bennett. 40 percent of those polled were undecided. The poll also asked who would make the best premier; Coleman, Liberal leader Dwight Ball, or New Democratic Party leader Lorraine Michael. On this question Ball was first with 35 percent, followed by Coleman at 24 percent and Michael at 15 percent, 25 percent of those polled were undecided on who would be the best premier. Weeks into the leadership race the party disqualified Bennett after he made a series of inappropriate comments on Twitter. On April 17, 2014, Barry announced he was abandoning his bid to be leader because he did not feel he had the support to defeat Coleman. With Barry's exit Coleman was acclaimed as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. He announced his withdrawal from the leadership citing personal family matters, less than three weeks before his scheduled swearing in.

It was the only agricultural college in the United Kingdom whose buildings were purpose designed and built.BBC: Domesday Reloaded [Broken link: this needs to be checked against the status of Cirencester‚Äôs Royal Agricultural College/University, which was housed in purpose built premises, albeit around an old 17thC farmhouse and barn, in 1845.] It was located 3 miles from Newton Abbot. The college was established in accordance with the will of Charles Seale Hayne (1833-1903), a Liberal politician who was a Devon land-owner. The college was built between 1912 and 1914, but its opening was delayed by the start of the First World War. During the war it served as a training centre for Land Girls, and in 1918 and 1919 it operated as a military neurasthenic hospital for the treatment of soldiers suffering from shell shock.Seale- Haynians website The first students arrived in 1920. During the Second World War the college was used for the training of the second Women's Land Army. After the war the college was significantly expanded, and by 1986 there were over 1,000 students. In 1989 the college merged with Plymouth Polytechnic to form the Seale-Hayne Faculty of Agriculture, Food & Land Use, Polytechnic South West. (Polytechnic South West became the University of Plymouth in 1992). In 2005 the university closed the college and staff and students were transferred to Plymouth. Until January 31st 2019 the Seale-Hayne site was used by Dame Hannah Rogers Trust, which provided education, therapy, care and respite for children and young people with profound physical disabilities as well as a centre to hold events to raise funds for the Dame Hannah Rogers School in Ivybridge.

Commissioned in 1814, the project intended to enclose the Back Bay basin and utilize the flowing tidal waters for industrial production. Constructing the dam would allow water to reliably flow from the Charles River to the basin, creating an ideal environment for the era's industrial mills. The project additionally added a second route to the mainland that redirected traffic away from Boston's choked Orange Street causeway. Between 1818 and 1821, the dam was constructed by extending Beacon Street westward.  Geography  The Boston Milldam occupied what is today the westward extension of Beacon Street. Prior to the construction of the Milldam, Beacon street ended at the foot of Charles Street ‚Äì Back Bay's tidal basin prevented any further construction. The dam had two arms, one stretching from Beacon Hill to Sewall's point (today, Kenmore Square) and one stretching from Roxbury's Gravelly point. These sections of the dam enclosed the back bay in a 600-acre tidal basin. The tidal basin was later filled in and is now occupied by the Back Bay Neighborhood.  Construction  The idea for the Milldam was conceived by Uriah Cotting, a real estate merchant who had established a reputation for developing the Boston waterfront. Boston historian Justin Winsor described Cotting as \\"the projector and guiding spirit in nearly every enterprise involving the development of the town for business during the first twenty years\\" of the 19th century. The idea was developed in response to a shortage of industrial goods during the War of 1812, for Cotting believed Boston's tides could be utilized to power factories. On June 14, 1814, the Massachusetts Legislature approved the construction of the dam. However, a slow industrial economy following the War of 1812 delayed the dam's immediate construction. Despite the economic troubles, merchants were eager to invest in the dam. Cotting predicted that the dam would yield 81 mills and cost $250,000, but bring in $520,000 a year in revenue. It would also provide a second route to the towns of Brookline, Brighton, and Watertown. Construction began in 1818, and would continue until 1821. Cotting died two years prior to the dam's completion in 1819. Constructed from stone, one arm of the dam was built from the foot of Beacon Hill to Sewell's Point (now Kenmore Square) in Brookline. A second cross-dam was constructed from Gravelly Point in Roxbury, dividing Back Bay into two basins of 600 combined acres. At high tide the waters of the Charles River would enter the westerly basin, pass through channels to generate turbine power, and then empty back into the Charles at low tide.  Failure and aftermath  The milldam project is regarded as a failure. Construction ran significantly over budget, costing nearly $700,000 instead of the proposed $250,000. Only three factories would become established along Boston's waters instead of the predicted 81. Pollution also became a problem immediately after the construction of the Milldam. Enclosing the dam led to stagnant and foul water, precipitating several complaints by the residents of Boston. Cotton's reputation was saved by his early death, but the Boston & Roxbury Mill Corporation was negatively impacted by the dam's failure. The Milldam would persist for several more decades. Wanting to use the dirty, derelict bay for practical purpose, the Back Bay land reclamation project was commissioned in 1857 to construct new residential neighborhoods over the tidal basin. Boston and Roxbury Mill Corporation thus signed over the rights to the land in 1859. The seawall was extended to fill in the Back Bay mudflats in order to accommodate the new construction. The failure of the Milldam prevented back bay from becoming an industrial district, leading to its current incarnation as a rich collection of 19th-century residences.

Living non-avian reptiles form a paraphyletic group that consists of over 9,000 species of crocodiles, turtles, and lepidosaurs. The most diverse group, Lepidosauria, is first known from the Middle Triassic (240 million years ago) fossils, but likely originated in the Permian (approximately 300-250 million years ago).Jones, M. E. H., Anderson, C. L., Hipsley, C. A., M√ºller, J., Evans, S. E., and R. R. Schoch. 2013. Integration of molecules and new fossils supports a Triassic origin for Lepidosauria (lizards, snakes, and tuatara). BMC Evolutionary Biology 13:208‚Äì229. Living lepidosaurs, which include snakes, lizards, and rhynchocephalians, occupy a wide range of environments and niches.The lepidosaurs have many similar anatomical morphology like transverse cloaca, distal tongue, superficial teeth attachment, fused pelvic bones etc. Though widely viewed as obligate carnivores, a small number of lepidosaurs are known to consume plant material. For example, there are roughly 3,300 species of living lizards and approximately 3% of them eat at least some plants. Though the exact definition of herbivory varies significantly between scientists, most define herbivorous lepidosaurs as those that consume plants for approximately 70-90% of its diet.  Evolution of herbivory in lepidosaurs  = Herbivory in fossil lepidosaurs = The fossil record of herbivorous lepidosaurs extends into the Late Triassic period, nearly 227 million years ago. A recently described sphenodontian reptile is one of the oldest known herbivorous lepidosaurs. This animal possesses a number of features that demonstrate an herbivorous lifestyle, such as a specialized jaw movement (propalinal) and closely packed teeth that appear to be useful in the shearing of plant material.Mart√≠nez, R. N., C. Apaldetti, C. E. Colombi, A. Praderio, E. Fern√°ndez, P. Santi Malnis, G. A. Correa, D. Abelin, and O. Alcober. 2013. A new sphenodontian (Lepidosauria: Rhynchocephalia) from the Late Triassic of Argentina and the early origin of the herbivore opisthodontians. Proceedings of the Royal Society B 280:20132057. Phylogenetic analysis shows that herbivory likely evolved in the sphenodontian clade once, specifically within in a group called the Opisthodontia. This group of herbivorous sphenodonts possessed wide, shredding teeth and became extinct during the Late Cretaceous (approximately 65 million years ago). These ancient herbivorous animals clearly demonstrate that the ability to consume plant material evolved very early in the history of lepidosaurs. The evolution of herbivory in squamates (the group that includes lizards and snakes) is less well known, though herbivorous species are found in the fossil record. A large bodied lizard, Polyglyphanodon sternbergi, from the Late Cretaceous of Utah is likely an herbivore. The diet is reconstructed based on the tooth shape; a thin transverse blade-like tooth, with fine serrations, similar to living iguanas.Nydam, R. L. and R. L. Cifelli. 2005. New data on the dentition of the scincomorphan lizard Polyglyphanodon sternbergi. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 50: 73‚Äì78. Others, such as Barbaturex morrisoni, illuminate important ecological niches that living squamates do not fill in modern environments.Head, J. J., Gunnell, G. F., Holroyd, P. F., Hutchison, J. F., and R. L. Ciochon. 2013. Giant lizards occupied herbivorous mammalian ecospace during the Paleogene greenhouse in Southeast Asia. Proceedings of the Royal Society B 280:20130665. B. morrisoni is an herbivorous acrodontan lizard found in the middle Eocene of Myanmar and is notable for its large body size (approximately 1 meter). The large body size demonstrates that competition with herbivorous mammals did not limit the mass of this genus. B. morrisoni also provides evidence that large lizards can occupy ecological niches that are commonly thought to belong solely to mammals, such as a large bodied terrestrial herbivore. = Modern herbivory = In their 2002 study, William Cooper Jr. and Laurie Vitt investigated the dietary patterns of over a hundred lizards and found that many groups have representatives that consume plant material. Omnivory has evolved independently several times within lepidosaurs, whereas the evolution of obligate herbivory has proved to be more rare. For example, in the Iguania clade, omnivory and herbivory have independently evolved at least nine times. When other lepidosaur clades are included, Cooper and Vitt (2002) demonstrate that omnivory evolved at least 32 separate times. Obligate herbivory, on the other hand, has only evolved 10 times in living, non-liolaemid lizards (nearly 7,700 species). Though, one clade seems to be an exception to this pattern of infrequently developed herbivory. A 2004 study investigated a unique group of South American lizards called the Liolaemidae. The authors of this study found that this clade evolved herbivory approximately 65 times faster than other squamates. Specifically, herbivory has evolved 18 times in liolaemids (approximately 170 species).Espinosa, R. E., Wiens, J. J. and C. R. Tracy. 2004. Recurrent evolution of herbivory in small, cold-climate lizards: Breaking the ecophysiological rules of reptilian herbivory. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 101:16819‚Äì16824. It has been clearly demonstrated that these herbivorous animals have evolved from omnivorous ancestors and not directly from carnivores. Unfortunately, many biological studies have not investigated the possible timing that key herbivorous characteristics evolved; leaving the amount of time these organisms have possessed these traits unknown. The distinctions in dietary ecology that are observed today are likely a result of early ecological differences between clades. The separation of the Iguania and Scleroglossa (a group including geckos, snakes, skinks, and varanids) clades in the late Triassic best demonstrates this. It is hypothesized that the early Scleroglossa possessed traits that were better suited for hunting, such as the ability to distinguish prey by means of chemical processes, whereas the Iguania did not possess these traits.Vitt, L. J., and E. R. Pianka. 2005. Deep history impacts present-day ecology and biodiversity. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 102:7877‚Äì7881. Therefore, the current dietary diversity within the Iguania (including a large number of herbivores) is due to certain traits held by early representatives of this clade.  Living herbivorous lepidosaurs  There are more than 7,800 species of squamate reptiles living today and approximately 2% of them are herbivorous, though the number is continually increasingStruck, U., Altenbach, A. V., Gaulke, M., Glaw, F. 2002. Tracing the diet of the monitor lizard Varanus mabitang by stable isotope analyses (Œ¥15N, Œ¥13C). Naturwissenschaften 89:470‚Äì473.). Herbivorous squamates are known from all major groups, including varanids. Less than two decades ago it was believed that there were no herbivorous Anguinomorpha (the clade that includes monitor lizards and possibly snakes;King, G. M. 1996. Reptiles and Herbivory. Chapman & Hall, London, UK, 160 pp.), but recent researched has demonstrated that the species Varanus mabitang was a strict herbivore and its sister species, Varanus olivaceus, may be an omnivore.Gaulke, M. 2004. Varanus mabitang; pp. 208‚Äì211 in E. R. Pianka and D. R. King with R. A. King (eds.), Varanoid Lizards of the World. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana.Pianka, E. R. 2004. Varanus olivaceus; pp. 220‚Äì224 in E. R. Pianka and D. R. King with R. A. King (eds.), Varanoid Lizards of the World. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana. Additionally, a new giant (>2 m in length) varanid (Varanus bitatawa) may also solely consume fruit, though a thorough examination of its dietary ecology has not been conducted.Welton, L. J., Siler, C. D., Bennett, D., Diesmos, A., Duya, M. R., Dugay, R., Rico, E. L. B., Van Weerd, M., and R. M. Brown. 2010. A spectacular new Philippine monitor lizard reveals a hidden biogeographic boundary and a novel flagship species for conservation. Biology Letters 6:654‚Äì658. Though present in all major squamate clades, herbivory is most prevalent within the Iguania.Cooper, W. E., Jr., and L. J. Vitt. 2002. Distribution, extent, and evolution of plant consumption by lizards. Journal of Zoology 257:487‚Äì517. In this group alone, herbivory and omnivory developed at least nine times. Herbivory is well developed in the Iguanidae, a clade within the Iguania. The majority of the animals that have been studied utilize plant material for nearly 100% of their diet, and therefore, the common ancestor of this group was likely an herbivore. Within the liolaemids, herbivory has evolved at least eight times (though it is estimated to have evolved upwards of 18 times). Additionally, the Agamidae evolved herbivory twice, in the genera Hydrosaurus and Uromastyx. Herbivory is rare in species outside the Iguania clade, but is present in isolated squamate groups. Within the Scincomorpha (a clade that includes skinks), herbivory independently evolves at least seven times. Specifically, herbivory independently develops at least once in the Lacertidae, Gerrhosauridae, Teiidae clades, and four times in the Scincidae (in the Corucia, Egernia, Macroscincus, and Tiliqua genera).  Diet  There is a diverse range in diets among herbivorous lepidosaurs. The marine iguana, Amblyrhynchus cristatus, feeds primarily on algae. The spiny-tail lizard (Uromastyx aegyptia), which is found throughout the deserts of the Middle East, feeds mainly on desert grasses. This lizard likely also eats flowering plants, but due to no rain falling during the study period, the animals were not observed consuming these plants.Cunningham, P. L. 2001. Notes on the diet, survival rate, and burrow specifics of Uromastyx aegyptius microlepis from the United Arab Emirates. Asiatic Herpetological Research 9:30‚Äì33. Other herbivores, such as Ctenosaura pectinata (the spiny- tail iguana), have a mixed diet, with 52% of its diet composed of leaves, 35% flowers, and 2% of fruits. This diet stands in stark contrast with an iguana from the same genus, Ctenosaura similis. This animal's diet is composed of primarily fruit (73%) and leaves (25%), with no consumption of flowers. The green iguana (Iguana iguana) has a similar diet to the spiny-tail iguana, with its diet composed of 52.1% leaves, 7.7% fruit, and 35.2% flowers. Research has demonstrated that green iguanas are selective in their plant choice, specifically in leaves. Green iguanas, regardless of age, preferentially select immature leaves to eat. Additionally, younger individuals (hatchlings and juveniles) consumed a higher proportion of immature leaves than adults. This selection allows them to access leaves high in protein.Troyer, K. 1984. Structure and function of the digestive tract of a herbivorous lizard Iguana iguana. Physiological Zoology 57:1-8. The diet of the herbivorous varanid, Varanus mabitang, is composed of fruits from palms augmented by the seeds of screw palms and figs. Many herbivorous lizards will eat insects in captivity.Pianka, E. R. and L. J. Vitt (eds). 2003. Lizards: Windows to the Evolution of Diversity. University of California Press, Berkeley, California, 333 pp. For example, the desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis) consistently eats mealworms in zoos, whereas in the wild its diet consists of solely plants. The desert iguana also provides an excellent example of seasonal diet changes in herbivorous reptiles. Flowers from the creosote bush make up its diet in the springtime, whereas after the month of May the diet is made up of a more diverse range of plant material.Pianka, E. R. 1971. Ecology of Two Lizards. Copeia 1:129‚Äì138. = Ontogenetic effect on diet = Though not well understood for most lizards, the diet of some herbivorous reptiles changes through ontogeny. This dietary shift is well documented in the spiny-tailed iguana, Ctenosaura pectinata. Insects compose more than 85% of the diet of juveniles, whereas the diet of adults is completely herbivorous. The shift is not due to the inability to consume plant material, as juveniles possess an enlarged hindgut (a feature that demonstrates their ability to digest plant materialDurtsche, R. D. 2000. Ontogenetic plasticity of food habits in the Mexican spiny-tailed iguana, Ctenosaura pectinata. Oecologia 124:185‚Äì195.). Instead, this ontogenetic change in diet is likely due to growth demands. Juveniles of the genus Ctenosaura have a higher growth rate than other herbivorous reptiles, and insects are a rich source of protein that is easily digested. Other ontogenetic shifts in diet involve changes in plant consumption. Juvenile green iguanas preferentially select immature leaves, which are rich in protein, though fiber content is high. Therefore, juvenile iguanas employ a different strategy for attaining the energy necessary for an increased growth rate.  Biomechanics  Herbivorous lizards possess a number of adaptations that allow them to consume plant material. These adaptations range from changes in tooth morphology to shifts in the digestive system. = Cranium = Until recently, it was believed that the skulls of herbivorous lizards varied little from that of their carnivorous relatives. Using a technique called geometric morphometrics, Stayton (2006) demonstrated that there is convergence to a similar skull shape among herbivorous lizards. The convergent features, which include large orbits, reduced snouts, and a tall skull, allow for a strong bite.Stayton, C. T. 2006. Testing hypothesis of convergence with multivariate data: Morphological and functional convergence among herbivorous lizards. Evolution 60:824‚Äì841. Additionally, herbivorous lizards often possess a fleshy tongue, which is used to manipulate food in the mouth.Throckmorton, G. S. 1976. Oral food processing in two herbivorous lizards, Iguana iguana (Iguanidae) and Uromastyx aegyptius (Agamidae). Journal of Morphology 148:363-390 In fact, in Ctenosaura pectinata, many leaves found in the stomach were folded into a bolus, likely to increase the amount of food that the animal can consume. = Teeth = The dental morphology of herbivorous lizards has been studied in greater detail. One of the first studies was published in 1955 and investigated the correlation between diet and tooth morphology. Hotton (1955)Hotton, N., III. 1955. A survey of adaptive relationships of dentition to diet in the North American Iguanidae. American Midland Naturalist 53:88‚Äì114. found that the tooth morphology did vary with diet, and that herbivorous taxa tended to possess laterally compressed, sharp, cuspate teeth. Later research supported this, and found that this morphology, particularly in Iguana, may be used to shear plants.Montanucci, R. R. 1968. Comparative dentition in four iguanid lizards. Herpetologica 24:305‚Äì315. Throckmorton (1976) compared Iguana iguana and Uromastyx aegyptia and found distinct similarities and differences between the taxa. It was found that both used their dentition to crop plants, even though their tooth shape differs significantly. The teeth come together and act as scissors, which allow the jaw muscles to act at one point at a time, shearing the plant material. In both animals the fleshy tongue is used to hold the plant material in place as the teeth cut through it. In Iguana iguana the pterygoid teeth aid in stabilizing the food, whereas the dentary of Uromastyx moves back to accomplish the same task. The difference in dental morphology between these two taxa is due to distinct tooth replacement strategies. The Iguana teeth are continually replaced, likely due to their fragility, whereas the Uromastyx teeth are not replaced and must be longer lasting. It is thought that little mastication occurs in both species, aside from simple cropping. Unfortunately, little other research has been conducted on the function of herbivorous reptile teeth. = Digestive system = The digestive system of herbivorous lizards has undergone significant modification when compared to carnivorous lizards. For example, these animals store symbiotic microorganisms in the foregut and hindgut that specifically aid in the digestion of plant material. Much of the fermentation of the plant material occurs in the hindgut, or colon, where symbiotic organisms breakdown plant material that has otherwise been resistant to digestion. In both small and large lizards the small intestine is relatively shorter, whereas the large intestine is relatively longer. There have also been additional transverse valves documented in the large intestine, specifically in Ctenosaura pectinata. The number of these septa increased through ontogeny, with juveniles (who are insectivorous) having two to four valves, whereas adults possessed five to six. These valves help slow the passage of food, which allow the symbiotic organisms more time to breakdown difficult to digest material.Iverson, J. B. 1980. Colic modifications in iguanine lizards. Journal of Morphology 163:79‚Äì93. Furthermore, the transverse slit receive ducts and products of the genital, digestive and urinary tract. = Sensory system = Lepidosaurs take advantage of their sensory system to assist them in food detection and consumption. Their sensory vision consists of a retina covered with single layer of photoreceptor cells and the nocturnal lepidosaurs also have rod-like cells in their photoreceptor cells.Schwenk, K. (2000). Chapter 8 Feeding in Lepidosaurs. In Feeding: Form, function and evolution in tetrapod vertebrates (pp. 175-291). Elsevier. Chemoreception further allows them to detect food odours through the Vomeronasal System (Jacobsen's organ), olfactory system through the nasal cavity and gustation by the tongue's surface.  Effect of temperature on diet  Until recently, it was believed that herbivorous lizards were restricted to the tropicsZimmerman, L. C., and C. R. Tracy. 1989. Interactions between the environment and ectothermy and herbivory in reptiles. Physiological Zoology 62:374‚Äì409. and a large body size.Pough, F. H. 1973. Lizard energetics and diet. Ecology 54:837‚Äì844. These constraints were thought to be a result of their supposed inefficiency in digesting their food compared to carnivorous lizards or mammalian herbivores. Herbivorous lizards utilize symbiotic microorganisms to aid in the digestion of plant material, and higher internal temperatures promote these organisms and the digestion of plant material overall. Zimmerman and Tracy (1989) found that lower body temperatures decreased the rate at which food passes through the digestive system in the chuckwalla (Sauromalus obsesus). Additionally, it was believed that herbivory was found only in large lizards (>300g). A large body size would encourage a higher and more stable body temperature, on average. Large body size also makes it difficult and inefficient to catch and consume small insects, making herbivory the only energy efficient option for large-bodied lizards, though varanids were not considered in these studies. The recent discovery of a large number of small-bodied herbivorous lizards (>100g; liolaemids) living in South America has forced scientists to rethink the physiological constraints faced by herbivorous lizards. Many of these lizards live at higher latitudes or elevations, and therefore, in much cooler climates than those seen in the tropics. The authors of these studies find that, similar to tropical herbivorous lizards, the liolaemids have a higher body temperature, which may explain their small body size. A small body size would allow these lizards to take advantage of the brief warm periods experienced at high latitudes or elevations, which a larger lizard would otherwise not be able to exploit. These animals illustrate the breadth of information that remains unknown with regard to herbivorous lepidosaurs.

Prelude Earlier in 230 BC, Illyrian forces under Queen Teuta and Scerdilaidas had invaded Epirus through both land and by sea, capturing Phoenice and much of Epirus, passing Antigoneia and nearing Helicranum (modern Ioannina). Despite an Illyrian victory at the Battle of Phoenice, a pro-Dardanian rebellion in the north-east of the Kingdom forced Teuta to call back Illyrian forces from Epirus. Teuta quickly crushed the rebellion, and now turned towards Issa, situated off the coastline of Illyria. Siege Shortly after defeating the rebels, Illyrians under Teuta and Demetrius, commander of neighbouring Pharos island, begun to siege Issa. Soon after the siege begun, Rome sent ambassadors to meet Teuta at Issa. Teuta ordered the killing of one of the ambassadors who had offended her. Following this, Rome declared war, starting the First Illyrian War in 230 BC, and invaded Illyrian occupied Corcyra. The commander of the Illyrian garrison in Corcyra was Demetrius, who surrendered his forces, along with control of Corcyra and Pharos, to the Romans and betrayed Teuta. The Romans then landed at southern Illyria with the guidance of Demetrius, and after much success, they sailed north to relieve the siege of Issa in 229 BC. The Romans defeated the Illyrian besiegers and relieved the Issaeans, with the island coming under Roman protection. The Illyrian besiegers acting under Demetrius were spared by the Romans, whilst those under Teuta retreated to Arbo. Cause of the War Polybius says that the Romans had sent ambassadors to Illyria due to the killings of Romans and numerous attacks on Roman vessels by the Illyrians. Appian, on the other hand, says that Romans intervened after Issa requested Roman support. A later historian, Gruen, states that Appian (who reported the siege almost four centuries after Polybius) and later historians misinterpreted Roman intervention, saying it was just a coincidence that the Illyrians were besieging Issa, and that Roman intervention just to liberate Issa was an inadequate excuse for war (though it is possible that Issa did indeed request Roman assistance). As well as this, after the Romans begun the First Illyrian War in 230 BC, they first captured many other territories, leaving Issa to be besieged for over a year, before finally liberating the island towards the end of the campaign.

However, the Han Dynasty (206 BCE‚Äì220 CE) established military colonies (tuntian) and commanderies (duhufu) to control Xinjiang from 120 BCE, while the Tang Dynasty (618-907) also controlled much of Xinjiang until the An Lushan rebellion. Chinese historians refute Uyghur nationalist claims by pointing out the 2000-year history of Han settlement in Xinjiang, documenting the history of Mongol, Kazakh, Uzbek, Manchu, Hui, Xibo indigenes in Xinjiang, and by emphasizing the relatively late \\"westward migration\\" of the Huigu (equated with \\"Uyghur\\" by the PRC government) people from Mongolia the 9th century. Buddhist Uyghur migration into the Tarim Basin The discovery of the Tarim mummies has created a stir in the Uyghur population of the region, who claim the area has always belonged to their culture. While scholars generally agree that it was not until the 10th century when the Uyghurs have moved to the region from Central Asia, these discoveries have led Han Kangxin to conclude that the earliest settlers were not Asians. American Sinologist Victor H. Mair claims that \\"the earliest mummies in the Tarim Basin were exclusively Caucasoid, or Europoid\\" with \\"east Asian migrants arriving in the eastern portions of the Tarim Basin around 3,000 years ago\\", while Mair also notes that it was not until 842 that the Uighur peoples settled in the area. Protected by the Taklamakan Desert from steppe nomads, elements of Tocharian culture survived until the 7th century, when the arrival of Turkic immigrants from the collapsing Uyghur Khaganate of modern-day Mongolia began to absorb the Tocharians to form the modern-day Uyghur ethnic group. Yuan dynasty Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers.Biran 2005, p. 96. Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called \\"Right Alan Guard\\" which was combined with \\"recently surrendered\\" soldiers, Mongols, and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi (Ch'i Kung-chih). Qing dynasty The Zunghar Khanate (c.1750) (within blue borders) = Dzungar Genocide = Some scholars estimate that about 80% of the Dzungar population, or around 500,000 to 800,000 people, were killed by a combination of warfare, massacres and disease during or after the Qing conquest in 1755‚Äì1757. After wiping out the native population of Dzungaria, the Qing government then resettled Han, Hui, Uyghur, and Xibe people on state farms in Dzungaria along with Manchu Bannermen to repopulate the area. This appears to be a new manouver to reduce the number of genocides in China¬¥s history. Dzungaria was part of Mongolia, possibly only Inner Mongolia, and where resistance to the Manchu famine tyranny subjugation and takeover of China occurred, and most of the Dzungars perished on the battlefield and in the massacres following their failure against the Manchus. Consequences of the Genocide in Xinjiang's demographics The Qing \\"final solution\\" of genocide to solve the problem of the Zunghar Mongols, made the Qing sponsored settlement of millions of Han Chinese, Hui, Turkestani Oasis people (Uyghurs) and Manchu Bannermen in Dzungaria possible, since the land was now devoid of Zunghars., but it seems that there is a historical shift of Dzunghars in Mongolia being declared and a claim more to Central Asia of the Uyghurs of Sinkiang (Xingjiang) and their leader Yakub Beg.Perdue 2009, p. 285.Tamm 2013, The Dzungarian basin, which used to be inhabited by (Zunghar) Mongols, is currently inhabited by Kazakhs.Tyler 2004, p. 4. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they exterminated the Zunghar Oirat Mongols in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern area, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.ed. Starr 2004, p. 243. In Dzungaria, the Qing established new cities like √úr√ºmqi and Yining.Millward 1998, p. 102. The Qing were the ones who unified Xinjiang and changed its demographic situation.Liu & Faure 1996, p. 71. The depopulation of northern Xinjiang after the Buddhist √ñ√∂l√∂d Mongols (Zunghars) were slaughtered, led to the Qing settling Manchu, Sibo (Xibe), Daurs, Solons, Han Chinese, Hui Muslims, and Turkic Muslim Taranchis in the north, with Han Chinese and Hui migrants making up the greatest number of settlers. Since it was the crushing of the Buddhist √ñ√∂l√∂d (Dzungars) by the Qing which led to promotion of Islam and the empowerment of the Muslim Begs in southern Xinjiang, and migration of Muslim Taranchis to northern Xinjiang, it was proposed by Henry Schwarz that \\"the Qing victory was, in a certain sense, a victory for Islam\\".Liu & Faure 1996, p. 72. Xinjiang as a unified, defined geographic identity was created and developed by the Qing. It was the Qing who led to Turkic Muslim power in the region increasing since the Mongol power was crushed by the Qing while Turkic Muslim culture and identity was tolerated or even promoted by the Qing.Liu & Faure 1996, p. 76. The Qing gave the name Xinjiang to Dzungaria after conquering it and wiping out the Dzungars, reshaping it from a steppe grassland into farmland cultivated by Han Chinese farmers, 1 million mu (17,000 acres) were turned from grassland to farmland from 1760-1820 by the new colonies.Marks 2011, p. 192. Wei Ning or a similar name was the genocide general in charge in Xinjiang then known as Sinkiang. =Settlement of Dzungaria with Han, Hui, Uyghurs (Taranchi), Xibo, and others= After Qing dynasty defeated the Dzungars Oirat Mongols and exterminated them from their native land of Dzungaria in the Zunghar Genocide, the Qing settled Han, Hui, Manchus, Xibe, and Taranchis (Uyghurs) from the Tarim Basin, into Dzungaria. Han Chinese criminals and political exiles were exiled to Dzungaria, such as Lin Zexu. Chinese Hui Muslims and Salar Muslims belonging to banned Sufi orders like the Jahriyya were also exiled to Dzhungaria as well. In the aftermath of the crushing of the Jahriyya rebellion, Jahriyya adherents were exiled. The Qing enacted different policies for different areas of Xinjiang. Han and Hui's migrants were urged by the Qing government to settle in Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang, while they were not allowed in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin oases with the exception of Han and Hui merchants.Clarke 2011, p. 20. In areas where more Han Chinese settled like in Dzungaria, the Qing used a Chinese style administrative system.Millward 2007, p. 101. The Manchu Qing ordered the settlement of thousands of Han Chinese peasants in Xinjiang after 1760, the peasants originally came from Gansu and were given animals, seeds, and tools as they were being settled in the area, for the purpose of making China's rule in the region permanent and a fait accompli.Perdue, Peter C. ‚ÄúMilitary Mobilization in Seventeenth and Eighteenth-Century China, Russia, and Mongolia.‚Äù Modern Asian Studies, vol. 30, no. 4, 1996, p. 773 https://www.jstor.org/stable/312949?seq=17. Taranchi was the name for Turki (Uyghur) agriculturalists who were resettled in Dzhungaria from the Tarim Basin oases (\\"East Turkestani cities\\") by the Qing dynasty, along with Manchus, Xibo (Xibe), Solons, Han and other ethnic groups in the aftermath of the destruction of the Dzhunghars.Millward 1998, p. 77.Millward 1998, p. 79.Perdue 2009, p. 339. Kulja (Ghulja) was a key area subjected to the Qing settlement of these different ethnic groups into military colonies.Rahul 2000, p. 97. The Manchu garrisons were supplied and supported with grain cultivated by the Han soldiers and East Turkestani (Uyghurs) who were resettled in agricultural colonies in Zungharia.Millward 1998, p. 23. The Manchu Qing policy of settling Chinese colonists and Taranchis from the Tarim Basin on the former Kalmucks (Dzungar) land was described as having the land \\"swarmed\\" with the settlers.Prakash 1963, p. 219.Islamic Culture, Volumes 27-29 1971, p. 229. The amount of Uyghurs moved by the Qing from Alt√§-sh√§h√§r (Tarim Basin) to depopulated Zunghar land in Ili numbered around 10,000 families.Rudelson 1997, p. 29.Rudelson 1997, p. 29.Rudelson 1992, p. 87. The amount of Uyghurs moved by the Qing into Jungharia (Dzungaria) at this time has been described as \\"large\\".Juntunen 2013, p. 128. The Qing settled in Dzungaria even more Turki-Taranchi (Uyghurs) numbering around 12,000 families originating from Kashgar in the aftermath of the Jahangir Khoja invasion in the 1820s.Tyler 2004, p. 67. Standard Uyghur is based on the Taranchi dialect, which was chosen by the Chinese government for this role.Rudelson 1997, p. 162. Salar migrants from Amdo (Qinghai) came to settle the region as religious exiles, migrants, and as soldiers enlisted in the Chinese army to fight in Ili, often following the Hui.Dwyer 2007, p. 79. In Dzungaria (Northern Xinjiang now stated but formerly appearing as part of Mongolia), the Qing exacted corv√©e labor for construction and infrastructure projects from Uyghur (Taranchi) colonizers and Han colonizers. Alt URL After a revolt by the Xibe in Qiqihar in 1764, the Qianlong Emperor ordered an 800-man military escort to transfer 18,000 Xibe to the Ili valley of Dzungaria in Xinjiang.Gorelova 2002, p. 37. In Ili, the Xinjiang Xibe built Buddhist monasteries and cultivated vegetables, tobacco, and poppies.Gorelova 2002, p. 37. One punishment for Bannermen for their misdeeds involved them being exiled to Xinjiang.Gorelova 2002, p. 37. Sibe Bannermen were stationed in Dzungaria while Northeastern China (Manchuria) was where some of the remaining √ñelet Oirats were deported to. The Nonni basin was where Oirat √ñelet deportees were settled. The Yenisei Kirghiz were deported along with the √ñelet. Chinese and Oirat replaced Oirat and Kirghiz during Manchukuo as the dual languages of the Nonni-based Yenisei Kirghiz. In 1765, 300,000 ch'ing of land in Xinjiang were turned into military colonies, as Chinese settlement expanded to keep up with China's population growth.Gernet 1996, p. 488. The Qing resorted to incentives like issuing a subsidy which was paid to Han who was willing to migrate to the northwest to Xinjiang, in a 1776 edict.Debata 2007, p. 59.Benson 1998, p. 21. There were very little Uyghurs in √úr√ºmqi during the Qing dynasty, √úr√ºmqi was mostly Han and Hui, and Han and Hui's settlers were concentrated in Northern Xinjiang (Beilu aka Dzungaria). Around 155,000 Han and Hui lived in Xinjiang, mostly in Dzungaria around 1803, and around 320,000 Uyghurs, living mostly in Southern Xinjiang (the Tarim Basin), as Han and Hui were allowed to settle in Dzungaria but forbidden to settle in the Tarim, while the small amount of Uyghurs living in Dzungaria and √úr√ºmqi was insignificant.Millward 2007, p. 306.Parker 2010, p. 140.Millward 1998, p. 51. Hans was around one-third of Xinjiang's population at 1800, during the time of the Qing Dynasty. Spirits (alcohol) were introduced during the settlement of northern Xinjiang by Han Chinese flooding into the area.ed. Fairbank 1978, p. 72. The Qing made a special case in allowing northern Xinjiang to be settled by Han, since they usually did not allow frontier regions to be settled by Han migrants. This policy led to 200,000 Han and Hui settlers in northern Xinjiang when the 18th century came to a close, in addition to military colonies settled by Han called Bingtun.Seymour & Anderson 1999, p. 13. The Qing Wianlong Emperor settled Hui Chinese Muslims, Han Chinese, and Han Bannermen in Xinjiang, the sparsely populated and impoverished Gansu provided most of the Hui and Han settlers instead of Sichuan and other provinces with dense populations from which Qianlong wanted to relieve population pressure. While a few people try to give a misportrayal of the historical Qing situation in light of the contemporary situation in Xinjiang with Han migration, and claim that the Qing settlements and state farms were an anti-Uyghur plot to replace them in their land, Professor James A. Millward pointed out that the Qing agricultural colonies in reality had nothing to do with Uyghur and their land, since the Qing banned settlement of Han in the Uyghur Tarim Basin and in fact directed the Han settlers instead to settle in the non-Uyghur Dzungaria and the new city of √úr√ºmqi, so that the state farms which were settled with 155,000 Han Chinese from 1760-1830 were all in Dzungaria and √úr√ºmqi, where there was only an insignificant amount of Uyghurs, instead of the Tarim Basin oases.Millward 2007, p. 104. Dzungaria which actually appears to have been in Mongolia, was subjected to mass Kazakh settlement after the defeat of the Dzungars. The China Year Book of 1914 said that there were \\"Some Ch'ahars on the river Borotala in Sinkiang (N. of Ili).\\". 6,000 agriculturalist migrants were reported by the military governor of Ili in 1788, in Ili, 3,000 migrant agriculturalists were reported in 1783, at √úr√ºmqi one thousand and at Ili agriculturalists of exile criminal backgrounds numbering 1,700 were reported in 1775, 1,000 or several hundred migrants moved to Ili yearly in the 1760s. Kalmyk Oirats return to Dzungaria The Oirat Mongol Kalmyk Khanate was founded in the 17th century with Tibetan Buddhism as its main religion, following the earlier migration of the Oirats from Zungharia through Central Asia to the steppe around the mouth of the Volga River. During the course of the 18th century, they were absorbed by the Russian Empire, which was then expanding to the south and east. The Russian Orthodox church pressured many Kalmyks to adopt Orthodoxy. In the winter of 1770‚Äì1771, about 300,000 Kalmyks set out to return to China. Their goal was to retake control of Zungharia from the Qing dynasty of China. Along the way many were attacked and killed by Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, their historical enemies based on intertribal competition for land, and many more died of starvation and disease. After several gruelling months of travel, only one-third of the original group reached Zungharia and had no choice but to surrender to the Qing upon arrival.History of Kalmykia These Kalmyks became known as Oirat Torghut Mongols. After being settled in Qing territory, the Torghuts were coerced by the Qing into giving up their nomadic lifestyle and to take up sedentary agriculture instead as part of a deliberate policy by the Qing to enfeeble them. They proved to be incompetent farmers and they became destitute, selling their children into slavery, engaging in prostitution, and stealing, according to the Manchu Qi- yi-shi.Dunnell 2004, p. 103.Millward 1998, p. 139. Child slaves were in demand on the Central Asian slave market, and Torghut children were sold into this slave trade.Millward 1998, p. 305. There are other accounts of the Khanate having temporarily expanded and it is also possible some of its population left it due to their imposition of Yasa etc. =Settlement of the Tarim Basin= Han and Hui merchants were initially only allowed to trade in the Tarim Basin, while Han and Hui settlement in the Tarim Basin was banned, until the Muhammad Yusuf Khoja invasion, in 1830 when the Qing rewarded the merchants for fighting off Khoja by allowing them to settle down permanently, however, few of them actually took up on the offer.Millward 2007, p. 113. Robert Michell noted that as of 1870, there were many Chinese of all occupations living in Dzungaria and they were well settled in the area, while in Turkestan (Tarim Basin) there were only a few Chinese merchants and soldiers in several garrisons among the Muslim population.Michell 1870, p. 2.Martin 1847, p. 21. =Conversion of Xinjiang into a province and effect on Uyghur migration= After Xinjiang was converted into a province by the Qing, the provincialisation and reconstruction programs initiated by the Qing resulted in the Chinese government helping Uyghurs migrate from southern Xinjiang to other areas of the province, like the area between Qitai and the capital, which was formerly nearly completely inhabited by Han Chinese, and other areas like √úr√ºmqi, Tacheng (Tabarghatai), Yili, Jinghe, Kur Kara Usu, Ruoqiang, Lop Nor, and the Tarim River's lower reaches.Millward 2007, p. 151. It was during Qing times that Uyghurs were settled throughout all of Xinjiang, from their original home cities in the western Tarim Basin. The Qing policies after they created Xinjiang by uniting Zungharia and Altishahr (Tarim Basin) led Uyghurs to believe that the all of Xinjiang province was their homeland, since the annihilation of the Zunghars (Dzungars) by the Qing, populating the Ili valley with Uyghurs from the Tarim Basin, creating one political unit with a single name (Xinjiang) out of the previously separate Zungharia and the Tarim Basin, the war from 1864-1878 which led to the killing of much of the original Han Chinese and Chinese Hui Muslims in Xinjiang, led to areas in Xinjiang with previously had insignificant amounts of Uyghurs, like the southeast, east, and north, to then become settled by Uyghurs who spread through all of Xinjiang from their original home in the southwest area. There was a major and fast growth of the Uyghur population, while the original population of Han Chinese and Hui Muslims from before the war of 155,000 dropped, to the much lower population of 33,114 Tungans (Hui) and 66,000 Han.Millward 2007, p. 152. Among the Uyghur settlers in Gulja (Yining in Ili) were Rebiya Kadeer's family, her family were descendants of migrants who moved across the Tianshan Mountains to Gulja, Merket was the hometown of her mother's father and Khotan was the hometown of her father's parents. =Qing era-demographics= At the start of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang.Millward, James A. (2007). Eurasian crossroads: A history of Xinjiang. . p. 306 A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% Han and 60% Turkic, while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census, however a situation similar to the Qing era-demographics with a large number of Han has been restored as of 2000 with 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur. Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation is similar to that of the early Qing period in Xinjiang. Before 1831, only a few hundred Chinese merchants lived in southern Xinjiang oases (Tarim Basin) and only a few Uyghurs lived in northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria).Millward, James A. (2007). Eurasian crossroads: A history of Xinjiang. . p. 104 Northern Xinjiang was where most Han were. =Population growth= The Qing dynasty gave large amounts of land to Chinese Hui Muslims and Han Chinese who settled in Dzungaria, while Turkic Muslim Taranchis were also moved into Dzungaria in the Ili region from Aqsu in 1760, the population of the Tarim Basin swelled to twice its original size during Qing rule for 60 years since the start, No permanent settlement was allowed in the Tarim Basin, with only merchants and soldiers being allowed to stay temporarily, up into the 1830s after Jahangir's invasion and Altishahr was open to Han Chinese and Hui (Tungan) colonization, the 19th century rebellions caused the population of Han to drop, the name \\"Eastern Turkestan\\" was used for the area consisting of Uyghuristan (Turfan and Hami) in the northeast and Altishahr/Kashgaria in the southwest, with various estimates given by foreign visitors on the entire region's population- At the start of Qing rule, the population was concentrated more towards Kucha's western region with around 260,000 people living in Altishahr, with 300,000 living at the start of the 19th century, one tenth of them lived in Uyghuristan in the east while Kashgaria had seven tenths of the population. Republic of China Hui Muslim General Bai Chongxi was interested in Xinjiang. He wanted to resettle disbanded Chinese soldiers there to prevent it from being seized by the Soviet Union. The Kuomintang settled 20,000 Han in Xinjiang in 1943.Lin 2007, p. 130. People's Republic of China The People's Republic of China has directed the majority of Han migrants towards the sparsely populated Dzungaria (Junggar Basin). Before 1953 75% of Xinjiang's population lived in the Tarim Basin, thus the Han migrants resulted in the distribution of population between Dzungaria and the Tarim being changed.Britannica Educational Publishing 2010,.Pletcher 2011, p. 318.Falkenheim 2011, p. 2. Most new Chinese migrants ended up in the northern region, in Dzungaria.Martyn 1978, p. 358. Han and Hui made up the majority of the population in Dzungaria's cities while Uighurs made up most of the population in Kashgaria's cities.Ethnological information on China 196?, p. 2. Eastern and Central Dzungaria are the specific areas where these Han and Hui are concentrated.Ethnological information on China 196?, p. 7. China made sure that new Han migrants were settled in entirely new areas uninhabited by Uyghurs so as to not disturb the already existing Uyghur communities.Rudelson 1997, p. 38. Lars-Erik Nyman noted that Kashgaria was the native land of the Uighurs, \\"but a migration has been in progress to Dzungaria since the 18th century\\".Nyman 1977, p. 12. Both Han economic migrants from other parts of China and Uyghur economic migrants from southern Xinjiang have been flooding into northern Xinjiang since the 1980s.Harris 2004, p. 42. Deliberately kept away from the Uyghur populated southern Xinjiang, Northern Xinjiang had been populated by 2 million Han in 1957‚Äì1967. page 124. From the 1950s to the 1970s, 92% of migrants to Xinjiang were Han and 8% were Hui. Most of these migrants were unorganized settlers coming from neighbouring Gansu province to seek trading opportunities. There were uprisings during the 1950s and or maybe 1960s according to the Pengin Historical Atlas of World History volume 2 by Hermann Kinder and Werner Hilgemann. After the Sino-Soviet split in 1962, over 60,000 Uyghurs and Kazakhs defected from Xinjiang to the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. China responded by reinforcing the Xinjiang-Soviet border area specifically with Han Bingtuan militia and farmers.Starr 2004, p. 138. Xinjiang's importance to China increased after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, leading to China's perception of being encircled by the Soviets.Clarke 2011, p. 76. The Chinese authorities viewed the Han migrants in Xinjiang as vital to defending the area against the Soviet Union.Clarke 2011, p. 78. Since the Chinese economic reform from the late 1970s has exacerbated uneven regional development, more Uyghurs have migrated to Xinjiang cities and some Han's has also migrated to Xinjiang for independent economic advancement. In the 1990s, there was a net inflow of Han people to Xinjiang, many of whom were previously prevented from moving because of the declining number of social services tied to hukou (residency permits). As of 1996, 13.6% of Xinjiang's population was employed by the publicly traded Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (Bingtuan) corporation. 90% of the Bingtuans activities relate to agriculture, and 88% of Bingtuan employees are Han, although the percentage of Hans with ties to the Bingtuan has decreased. Han emigration from Xinjiang has also resulted in an increase of minority-identified agricultural workers as a total percentage of Xinjiang's farmers, from 69.4% in 1982 to 76.7% in 1990. During the 1990s, about 1.2 million temporary migrants entered Xinjiang every year to stay for the cotton picking season. Many Uyghur trading communities exist outside of Xinjiang; the largest in Beijiang is one village of a few thousand. There was a chain of press releases in the 1990s on the violent insurrections in Xinjiang, some were made by the former Soviet supported URFET leader Yusupbek Mukhlisi.Wayne 2007, p. 46.Millward 2007, p. 341. There was a 1.7 growth in the Uyghur population in Xinjiang while there was a 4.4% growth from 1940‚Äì1982 in the Hui population in Xinjiang. Uyghur Muslims and Hui Muslims have experienced a growth in major tensions against each other due to the Hui population surging in its growth. Some old Uyghurs in Kashgar remember that the Hui army at the Battle of Kashgar (1934) massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which caused tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China.

She has exhibited her work internationally, in the United States and in Europe. She is best known for her exhibition Involuntary Memories. Her work includes video sculptures and focuses on memory, memory loss, and place. She describes her work as the attempt to understand memory from both a personal and emotional perspective. Her work was included in an exhibition at the Suyama Space in Seattle in 2013. Aschheim was a 2007 Artist-in-Residence at the McColl Center for Art + Innovation in Charlotte, NC. Education Aschheim graduated with a B.A. in Anthropology with Honors and Studio Art from Brown University in 1986, and a MFA in Sculpture from the University of Washington in 1990. Involuntary Memories Aschheim‚Äôs Involuntary Memories is a unique installation that utilizes several different art forms including drawings, sculptures, artifacts, and interviews completed in 2011-2012 at the Orange County Great Park (formerly known as the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro). The piece focuses on the relationships that people who lived during the Richard Nixon/ Vietnam War era now have with the period nearly 40 years later. For this piece, Aschheim chose to create original works of art in the form of sculptures and drawings gaining inspiration mainly from UC Irvine‚Äôs Archives and Special Collections. She then used these creations and added the text from the interviews she conducted in her open studio. The interviews showed both sides of the anti- and pro-war arguments during this era. There was also a video played by Penny Lane and Brian Frye that showcased a few excerpts from The Silent Majority: Super 8 Home Movies from the Nixon White House. Penny Lane and Brian Frye also produced a video titled ‚ÄúOur Nixon‚Äù which used archival footage of home movies by Nixon staffers. Meg Linton also wrote an intro for the exhibition. Indre Viskonta also wrote an essay regarding the piece. Involuntary Memories was an installation piece in Great Park Art Gallery, Orange County Great Park, Irvine, California 2013.

From her first marriage, she was the mother of two daughters ‚Äî Brunhilda and Galswintha ‚Äî who were married to two Merovingian brother-kings: Sigebert I of Austrasia and Chilperic, king of the Neustrian Franks. Following the death of her first husband Athanagild in 567, she became the second wife of Liuvigild the brother of Athangild's successor Liuva. Shortly thereafter Liuvigild became king of the Visigoths, and Goiswintha became Queen consort once more, and stepmother to her husband's sons Hermenegild and Reccared I. Gregory of Tours, Decem Libri Historiarum, V. 38; translated by Thorpe, History of the Franks, pp. 301f. Goiswintha was an influential personality in the royal court. In 579, her stepson Hermenegild married her granddaughter Ingund, daughter of Goiswintha's daughter Brunhilda by the Frankish king Sigebert I. As Queen, it fell to Goiswintha to welcome the young bride to court, and reportedly Goiswintha was at first very kind to the young princess. However, she was determined that Ingund should be re-baptized in the Arian faith. Ingund, still only twelve, firmly refused. According to Gregory of Tours: \\"the Queen lost her temper completely\\" and \\"seized the girl by her hair and threw her to the ground: then she kicked her until she was covered with blood, had her stripped naked and ordered her to be thrown into the baptismal pool\\".Gregory of Tours V 38 Whether because of this fracas, or, more likely, because of Leovigild's desire to assure the succession of his sons (consistent with his previous actions to associate his sons with himself as rulers of the kingdomThompson, 64), he sent Hermenegild and Ingund to Seville to rule a portion of his kingdom - presumably the province of Baetica and southern Lusitania. There, Hermenegild was influenced by his wife and Leander of Seville to convert to Chalcedonian Christianity, and to rebel against the king. He would eventually be defeated, and executed by the King in 585. Following Liuvigild's death in 586, his younger son Reccared became king. He promptly converted to Catholicism.

The program aims to expand the schemes of universal social security, by providing financial support and social protection to people 65 or older who a) do not benefit from retirement or contributory pension plans or b) receive income from retirement plans or contributory pension programs that does not exceed a certain amount determined by SEDESOL.  The Elderly Population in Mexico and its Vulnerability  Fueled by an increase in life expectancy, Mexico is going through an unprecedented demographic shift which has led to a rapid increase in the aging population over the last decades. From 1.8 million people aged 65 and older in 1970, the population within this age range increased to 4.7 million in 2000 and totaled 7.5 million in 2012 (which was equivalent to approximately 6.41% of the total population in 2012). By 2050, the number of people 65 or older is expected to reach 28.7 million, which will represent just over 20% of the total population. The high vulnerability of the elderly in Mexico (especially among those that do not benefit from social security and contributory pension plans) has been documented by several sources. Data from 2010 revealed that 28.8% of people 65 and up did not have access to social security. In 2012, estimates showed that 45.8% of the population aged 65 and up lived in poverty, and that 50% of the elders within this segment of the population were still working, even after reaching the usual retirement ages. Furthermore, data have suggested that one in 5 people over 65 have difficulty in engaging in normal daily activities (e.g. bathing, getting dressed, walking), have limited access to health services, and are not culturally prone to disease prevention. All these factors, along with a rise in the incidence of chronic diseases have worsened the elderly population's natural vulnerability that results from the end of a productive life and have created a greater dependence, as well as a reduction in their overall ability to function. In alignment with objective 2.4 of Mexico's National Development Plan 2013‚Äì2018 (and to National Strategy 2.4.2 in the Plan), the PPE seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the population aged 65 and up by providing its enrollees with a cash subsidy every two months, and by facilitating access to social security.  History  To target the increasing number of people that reached retirement age without social security coverage (i.e. mostly those who were part of the informal sector during most of their working life), the first safety net noncontributory pension program was launched in Mexico City in 2001. Subsequently, several states throughout the country as well as the federal government have developed similar programs. As of 2011, 17 out of the 32 states in Mexico had at least one safety net program. The federal PPE is an extension of the original ‚Äú70 and More Program‚Äù which began to operate in 2007. Originally, the program provided nationwide coverage to poor people aged at least 70 who lived in rural communities with no more than 2,500 inhabitants. However, since fiscal year 2013, the program targets all people 65 or over who live in rural or urban communities (regardless of the number of inhabitants) and who meet certain eligibility criteria. The inclusion of people in the 65‚Äì69 age range in both rural and urban communities was encouraged by the success of the previous ‚Äú70 and More Program‚Äù which showed an improvement in the quality of life of its enrollees and a reduction in their physical and mental health deterioration.  Program Characteristics  The PPE caters to the elderly population in Mexico by providing cash transfers to its beneficiaries on a bimonthly basis. As of 2014, enrollees received $1,160 Mexican pesos every two months. In addition, beneficiaries participate in informative sessions on health issues and receive assistance that enables them to access services and support from institutions such as the National Institute for the Older Adults (INAPAM) and other organizations that offer occupational activities. The program's budget for 2013 totaled 26 billion Mexican pesos, equivalent to 0.17% of Mexico's GDP in that year (based on OECD's economic projections). The following requirements must be met by individuals in order to qualify for PPE: * Age 65 and up * Mexican citizens or * Non-nationals who have lived in Mexico for over 25 years * If enrolled in the elderly component of the conditional cash transfer program, they must waive their right to benefit from that program * For the year 2019, the amount of financial support that older adults will receive is $ 1,275 mexican pesos a month, which will be delivered bimonthly = Benefits = PPE enrollees receive monetary grants every two months. In addition, the program: * Provides monetary assistance for the enrollees‚Äô inclusion in the financial system (i.e. opening a bank account). This aid applies only to those who receive electronic bank transfers. * Promotes social involvement by encouraging participation of beneficiaries in personal development groups, informative sessions on topics such as healthcare, human rights, etc. * Offers social protection to its members by promoting access to healthcare services (such as those offered by Seguro Popular) and encourages the affiliation to INAPAM (which provides other benefits for the elderly)  Program Enrollment  SEDESOL estimated that the total population aged 65 and over in Mexico was approximately 7.7 million in 2013. It also stated that the potential number of eligible PPE enrollees that year could range from 5.6 million to 6.2 million, depending on the source of data used (i.e. from 72.7% to 80.5% of the total population in the target age group). As of December 2013, SEDESOL reported a total of 4,248,047 beneficiaries of PPE in the country. = Proposals according to the OECD in 2016 = Mexico is among the three OECD countries that offer the lowest social pensions for people who are not covered by the contributory pension system. The OECD on Mexico's pension systems, published in 2016, the OECD, proposes four strategies; 1.- Increase, gradually, the mandatory contributions for the pension. According to the international organization, \\"a replacement rate of 50% can be achieved with a probability of 75 to 90%, contributing an average of 13 to 18% over 40 years.\\" 2.- Implement a pro-rata system to generate the transition from the old system to that of individual accounts. In this regard, the OECD recommends ‚Äúsmoothing‚Äù the step towards the defined contribution model in such a way that ‚ÄúAll the rights acquired to date by the workers of the so-called 'transition generation' would be guaranteed and from then on all the workers would accumulate pension assets in the new system. Consequently, the pension benefit of a 'transition generation' worker would have two components: one based on the rights acquired under the BD formula, and the other based on the assets accumulated in the individual CD accounts. 3.- Improve the social protection network for old age through its integration and expansion. Through its study, the OECD suggests ‚Äúincreasing the level of non- contributory benefits in order to eradicate poverty in old age. Furthermore, it underlines the importance of the link between the non-contributory social pension (Pension for Older Adults) and the Guaranteed Minimum Pension. 4.- Homogenize the retirement savings system, which until now has been fragmented. The OECD recommends ‚Äúharmonizing the rules for all pension plans, with the fundamental objective of establishing a national pension system that is the same for all Mexicans. This harmonization must include pension plans for workers in the private and public sectors, as well as special regimes (for states, municipalities, and universities, among others) ‚Äù.  Challenges  Although noncontributory pension programs have proved effective in different countries as a strategy to reduce poverty of the elder population without social security coverage or employer-based pensions, their greatest limitation is that they are subject to government funding availability. In the case of Mexico, Levy & Schady and Aguila, note that the expected future financial burden associated with the recent expansion of the PPE in terms of geographical coverage and number of beneficiaries represents the program's main challenge. This is because the number of eligible beneficiaries will continue to rise in the upcoming years, as a result of Mexico's demographic transition. Another limitation of the PPE includes the possibility of resource ‚Äúleakages‚Äù due to the enrollment of individuals that already benefit from other programs that target the elderly. Proposed measures to offset such challenges, are summarized below: * Designing mechanisms that promote retirement savings by covering future workforce through mandatory inclusion of workers in the social security system, regardless of whether they are part of the formal or the informal sector. * Increasing incentives to encourage the creation of a ‚Äúretirement savings culture‚Äù by designing products that address vulnerable elders, and develop alternatives with preferential tax treatment. * Identifying the number of beneficiaries that could be receiving support from other programs to quantify the amount of ‚Äúleakage‚Äù of resources. * Devise a new cost-based targeting method, that takes population growth and needs, budget constraints and the program's operation capacity into consideration.

Screen Daily, February 11, 2014. Written and directed by Stefan Haupt, the film concerns the social network of gay men that developed in Zurich in the 1940s and 1950s, centered on The Circle, a gay publication, and the social events it sponsored. As the police investigate three murders of gay men by rent boys, they scapegoat The Circle and its subscribers for making Zurich an international center of gay tourism. The film focuses on the story of Ernst Ostertag and R√∂bi Rapp, a schoolteacher and a drag entertainer, who met through their participation in the publication inner circle and began a lifelong romantic relationship. Interviews with them and other survivors and experts on the era are interspersed with documentary film and photographs as well as a scripted dramatic enactment of the story. The lack of legal proscription against homosexuals and Zurich's growing notoriety provide the context for the growth of a publication that overtly catered to a gay readership while avoiding explicit materials, both in prose and illustrations, in order to meet the standards of Swiss censorship.

Initiatives  CIMM's initiatives are related to the goals of improving television measurement through return path data and cross-platform video measurement. CIMM provides its findings to members for an exclusive time, and then makes the findings available publicly. = Asset identification= On April 18, 2013, CIMM, Ad-ID, the industry standard for identifying advertising assets (broadcast, print and digital) across all media platforms, and EIDR, a universal unique identifier system for movie and television assets, announced results of a two-year initiative for a universal identifier for professional video content and advertising. Nearly 30 media companies, advertisers and media research vendors participated in the initiative. Groundwork for the trackable asset cross-platform identification (TAXI) initiative began in 2011 when CIMM hired Ernst & Young for studies and tests simulating how open- standard asset registries ‚Äì specifically, Ad-ID and EIDR ‚Äì could be adopted within content and advertising supply-chains. The goal was to determine its benefits technical and operational feasibility. Before the end of 2013, CIMM begin registering all newly created video assets with the EIDR and Ad-ID registries =SMPTE collaboration= In the summer of 2013, CIMM began working with the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) on a standard to bind identifiers from Ad-ID and EIDR to video assets. The two organizations formed a study group composed of leading media and advertising companies and engineers. =Video data warehouse= On June 19, 2013, CIMM released a Request for Proposals (RFP) to design, build and maintain a ‚ÄúData Warehouse‚Äù of video viewing behavior across platforms, beginning with digital video programming data, that would be accessible by any participating organization. This centralized location would allow for the contribution and licensing of data necessary for improved cross-platform measurement and media planning and buying. CIMM is driving towards industry-wide support for this initiative and will be collaborating with the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau (CAB) and Media Rating Council (MRC). CIMM is reaching out to other organizations and companies and welcomes more participation. =Pilot tests= In February 2011, CIMM announced it was working with Arbitron and comScore on two independent, \\"proof-of-concept\\" pilot tests to measure three-screen users and their behavior with content and advertising across television, Internet and mobile. This initiative marked the first time that mobile Internet usage ‚Äì including mobile video and apps ‚Äì would be measured in \\"single source\\" cross- platform studies. The ultimate success of these two separate tests laid the foundation for what would become ‚ÄúProject Blueprint‚Äù ‚Äì a collaboration between Arbitron, comScore and CIMM member ESPN for a measurement initiative for video, audio and display content across radio, television, PCs, smartphones and tablets. =Lexicon= Through interviews with over 60 technical executives involved in extracting and analyzing television return path viewing data, media consultant Charlene Weisler updated the original 2010 CIMM Lexicon from 800 terms to over 1400 terms that cover advertising and television applications, including Connected TV, Interactive TV, Dynamic Ad Insertion, Automatic Content Recognition and other online technologies. The Lexicon can be accessed on CIMM's website. =USA TouchPoints= On August 10, 2010, CIMM announced it was bringing the \\"TouchPoints\\" initiative, began in 2006 in the United Kingdom, to the United States. This research project ‚Äì based on the U.K. Institute of Practitioners in Advertising's TouchPoints service and licensed by the Media Behavior Institute (MBI), was fielded by MBI in partnership with GfK MRI. IPA TouchPoints provided the media industry in the U.K. media planning data, across media including TV, radio, print, online and mobile. The project included a sample of 1000 men and women aged 18‚Äì54 drawn from respondents who completed GfK MRI's widely used \\"Survey of the American Consumer,\\" and employed eDiaries in which participants recorded their media behavior at 30-minute intervals over 10 days. That data was fused with existing media measurement services. This \\"hub and fusion\\" approach to cross- platform media measurement provides a time-based way of understanding consumers' media behavior. The study ran from September 2010 to February 2011. On August 16, 2011, GfK MRI and Nielsen announced they made equity investments in MBI, supporting USA TouchPoints. On September 29, 2011, the Media Behavior Institute announced that it had formally begun rolling out USA TouchPoints. ESPN signed on as the Charter Subscriber.

Henry Hague (1849‚Äì1914) was an English-born American Episcopal priest who was one of six founders of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity in 1873. Early life Henry A. Hague was born in England in the village of Ashton-Under-Lyne, now a suburb of Manchester. He had seen and explored much prior to the day Phi Sigma Kappa began. \\"He had worked as a factory hand, sailor and carpenter before deciding to return to further his education at college. He even served under Admiral Farragut at the end of the Civil War.\\" (p. 17) He was a Freemason, having joined that Order prior to his coming to Amherst. Although Hague became a popular speaker, early in life he was known to have troubles pronouncing his h‚Äôs. Setting aside his previous adventures, Hague enrolled as a student in the agricultural college to study religion, and, as fate would have it, he worked for the church much of his life. Slightly older than his peers when he entered college at Massachusetts Agricultural College, \\"Aggie,\\" he was already twenty-four by the start of his sophomore year. He proved an auspicious student; Hague graduated as the fourth ranking student in 1875, his senior year, placing behind three other Phi Sigs. Collegiate activities Like many of his fellow Founders, Hague participated in an array of collegiate activities. He was the most outwardly devotional. Hague's fellow Founder Brooks reported long after that it was he who converted Hague from his native Methodism to the Episcopal fold by showing him around among the \\"particularly shabby Methodist churches\\" in his own home neighborhood. (p. 20) Records indicate that Hague seems to have been the only one of the group to belong to the College's Christian Union, but he held many offices therein. While at Aggie, Hague was a member of the Washington Irving Literary Society, a popular pastime among the undergraduates. He was a member of the Gymnastic Association, and like others of the Fraternity's Founders held the military rank of lieutenant in the College's Battalion. He was a member of the class crew (rowing team) and an officer in the Naval Association. Hague was known to keep a pot of hot water for tea on his stove, the unpolished state of which got him into occasional trouble with his military inspector. He was a right- fielder on the college nine-man baseball team. Hague also managed the popular college store, along with his friend and fellow Founder, Brooks. His peers honored Hague by election as captain of his class. Yet among all these, it was his role as a Founder of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity in his Sophomore year by which he is best remembered today. Rev. Henry Hague, Jan 1910 Signet, 50 years old. Later years Upon graduation, Hague completed seminary and was appointed as rector of St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in Worcester, Massachusetts. He served in that capacity for thirty-two years. He was also dean of the Worcester convocation. Hague was married in 1879 to Harriet Davis. They had four sons, Robert, Edwin, Cuthbert and Henry.Genealogical records, Ancestry.com, accessed 20 April 2014 Cuthbert later attended nearby Amherst College (not to be confused with M.A.C.), and became a member of Phi Delta Theta.The Amherst Olio, vol LIII (1910 edition), p.77, accessed 12 May 2014, via Ancestry.com He corresponded regularly with fraternity leaders, and while not able to assist in an administrative function, nevertheless he remained interested and engaged in the fraternity all his life., page 73. Hague attended an initiation banquet for Phi Sigma Kappa in Amherst the winter before his death. Hague provided the words of a fitting benediction as he reflected in 1885 on the continuing growth of his Fraternity: > \\"After more or less talk, the suggestions, most of them very good, took > shape, and Phi Sigma Kappa was the result. Only as yet, however, in embryo, > the seed grew, and little by little the goodly child of today is the fruit. > Let us trust it to keep on growing till it shall become a full grown man, > having the strength to help and protect its members, wisdom to guide them to > helpful and good things as to college life, and love so warm that all its > members shall feel its kindly glow, that brotherly love may indeed be a > reality and not an idea\\".

Origins  The term \\"green criminology\\" was introduced by Michael J. Lynch in 1990, and expanded upon in Nancy Frank and Michael J. Lynch's 1992 book, Corporate Crime, Corporate Violence,Frank, Nancy and Michael J. Lynch 1992 Corporate Crime, Corporate Violence. Albany, NY: Harrow and Heston. which examined the political economic origins of green crime and injustice, and the scope of environmental law. The term became more widely used following publication of a special issue on green criminology in the journal Theoretical Criminology edited by Piers Beirne and Nigel South in 1998. Green criminology has recently started to feature in university-level curriculum and textbooks in criminology and other disciplinary fields.White, R., & Heckenberg, D. (2014) 'Green Criminology: An Introduction to the Study of Environmental Harm' London: Routledge. The study of green criminology has expanded significantly over time, and is supported by groups such as the International Green Criminology Working Group. There are increasing interfaces and hybrid empirical and theoretical influences between the study of green criminology, which focuses on environmental harms and crimes, and mainstream criminology and criminal justice, with criminologists studying the 'greening' of criminal justice institutions and practices in efforts to become more environmentally sustainable and the involvement of people in prison or on probation in ecological justice initiatives.Chapter 4 'Greening Justice' of Graham, H., & White, R. (2015) 'Innovative Justice' London: Routledge.White, R., & Graham, H. (2015) 'Greening Justice: Examining the Interfaces of Criminal, Social and Ecological Justice' British Journal of Criminology [Advance Online Access]: 1-21.Moran, D., & Jewkes, Y. (2014) Green' Prisons: Rethinking the ‚ÄòSustainability‚Äô of the Carceral Estate' Geographica Helvetica, vol 69: 345-353.  Approaches  Though green criminology was originally proposed as a political economic approach for the study of environmental harm, crime, law and justice, there are now several varieties of green criminology as noted below.For a general guide to green criminology, its definition, and varieties see, South, Nigel, Avi Brisman, and Piers Beirne. (2013). A guide to a green criminology. Pp. 27-42 in N. South and A. Brisman (eds), The Routledge international handbook of green criminology. UK: Routledge. = Political economy, environmental justice, and the treadmill of production approach = The initial grounding of green criminology was in political economic theory and analysis. In his original 1990 article,Lynch, Michael J. 1990. The Greening of Criminology: A Perspective for the 1990s. The Critical Criminologist 2,3:3-4,11-12. Lynch proposed green criminology as an extension of radical criminology and its focus on political economic theory and analysis. In that view, it was essential to examine the political economic dimensions of green crime and justice in order to understand the major environmental issues of our times and how they connect with the political economy of capitalism. The political economic approach was expanded upon by Lynch and Paul B. Stretesky in two additional articles in the Critical Criminologist.Lynch, Michael J. and Paul B. Stretesky. 1999. Clarifying the Analysis of Environmental Justice: Further Thoughts on the Critical Analysis of Environmental Justice Issues. The Critical Criminologist. 9,3: 5-8; Lynch, Michael J. and Paul B. Stretesky. 1998. Uniting Class and Race with Criticism Through the Study of Environmental Justice. The Critical Criminologist. Fall: 1, 4-7. In those articles, Lynch and Stretesky extended the scope of green criminology to apply to the study of environmental justice, and followed that work with a series of studies addressing environmental justice concerns,Stretesky, Paul B., and Michael J.

Throughout the development of the political economic approach to green criminology, scholars have made significant use of scientific and ecological literatures, as well as empirical analysis, which have become characteristics of this approach and distinguish it from other varieties of green criminology. = Nonspeciesist and nonhuman animal studies = The second major variation of green criminology is the nonspeciesist argument proposed by Piers Beirne.Beirne, Piers. 1999. For a nonspeciesist criminology: Animal abuse as an object of study. Criminology 37, 1: 117-148. In Beirne's view, the study of harms against nonhuman animals is an important criminological topic which requires attention and at the same time illustrates the limits of current criminological theorizing about, crime/harm, law and justice with its focus almost exclusively on humans.Beirne, Piers. 2009. Confronting animal abuse: Law, criminology, and human-animal relationships. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. This approach also includes discussions of animal rights. Beirne's approach to green criminology has been extremely influential, and there are now a significant number of studies within the green criminological literature focusing on nonhuman animal crimes and animal abuse.For examples see the special issue of Crime, Law and Social Change Beirne has edited (volume 55, number 5); Cazaux, Geertrui. 1999. Beauty and the beast: Animal abuse from a non-speciesist criminological perspective. Crime, Law and Social Change 31, 2 : 105-125. In addition to studies of animal abuse, included within the scope of nonhuman animal studies are those focused on illegal wildlife trade, poaching, wildlife smuggling, animal trafficking and the international trade in endangered species.Wyatt, Tanya. Green criminology & wildlife trafficking: The illegal fur and falcon trades in Russia Far East. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, 2012; Wyatt, Tanya. 2009. Exploring the organization of Russia Far East's illegal wildlife trade: two case studies of the illegal fur and illegal falcon trades. Global Crime 10, 1-2: 144-154. Many of the studies green criminologists undertake in this area of research are theoretical or qualitative. Ron Clarke and several colleagues, however, have explored empirical examinations of illegal animal trade and trafficking,Lemieux, Andrew M., and Ronald V. Clarke. 2009. The international ban on ivory sales and its effects on elephant poaching in Africa. British Journal of Criminology 49, 4: 451-471; Clarke, Ronald V., and A. Rolf. 2013. Poaching, habitat loss and the decline of neotropical parrots: a comparative spatial analysis. Journal of Experimental Criminology 9, 3: 333-353; Pires, Stephen, and Ronald V. Clarke. 2012. Are parrots CRAVED? An analysis of parrot poaching in Mexico. Journal of research in crime and delinquency 49, 1: 122-146; Pires, Stephen F., and Ronald V. Clarke. 2011. Sequential foraging, itinerant fences and parrot poaching in Bolivia. British Journal of Criminology 51, 2: 314-335. and this has become a useful approach for examining green crimes. Clarke's approach draws on more traditional criminological theory such as rational choice theory and crime opportunity theory, and hence is not within the mainstream of green criminological approaches. Nevertheless, Clarke's approach has drawn attention to important empirical explanations of green crimes. = Bio-piracy and eco- crimes = Similar to the political economic approach but without grounding in political economic theory, some green criminologists have explored the issue of green crime by examining how corporate behavior impacts green crimes.Ruggiero, Vincenzo, and Nigel South. 2013. Green criminology and crimes of the economy: theory, research and praxis. Critical Criminology 21, 3: 359-373. Among other issues, this approach has included discussions of eco- crimes and activities such as bio-piracy as discussed by Nigel South.South, Nigel. 2007. The ‚Äòcorporate colonisation of nature‚Äô: Bio-prospecting, bio- piracy and the development of green criminology. Pp. 230-247 in P. Beirne and N. South‚Äôs (ed), Issues in green criminology. Devon, UK: Willan. Bio-piracy is largely an effort by corporations to commodify native knowledge and to turn native knowledge and practices into for-profit products while depriving native peoples of their rights to that knowledge and those products, and in most cases, avoiding payments to natives for their knowledge or products. Bio- piracy includes issues of social and economic justice for native peoples. These kinds of crimes fall into the category of eco-crimes, a term associated with the work of Reece Walters.Walters, Reece. 2006. Crime, bio-agriculture and the exploitation of hunger. British Journal of Criminology 46, 1: 26-45. Also included within the examination of eco-crimes is the analysis of other ecologically harmful corporate behaviors such as the production of genetically modified foods Walters, Reece. 2007. Food crime, regulation and the biotech harvest. European Journal of Criminology 4, 2: 217-235. and various forms of toxic pollution.Walters, Reece. 2010. Toxic atmospheres air pollution, trade and the politics of regulation. Critical Criminology 18, 4: 307-323. = Ecocide = Ecocide describes attempts to criminalize human activities that cause extensive damage to, destruction of or loss of ecosystems of a given territory; and which diminish the health and well-being of species within these ecosystems including humans. It involves transgressions that violate the principles of environmental justice, ecological justice and species justice. When this occurs as a result of human behaviour, advocates argue that a crime has occurred. However, this has not yet been accepted as an international crime by the United Nations.White & Heckenberg. Green Criminology: An Introduction to the Study of Environmental Harm, Routledge, 2014, pp 45-59. = Eco-global criminology = Some of those who study environmental crime and justice prefer the use of Rob White's term, eco-global criminology.White, Rob. 2011. Transnational environmental crime: Toward an eco-global criminology. UK: Routledge; Ellefsen, Rune, Guri Larsen, and Ragnhild Sollund (eds). 2012. Eco- global Crimes: Contemporary Problems and Future Challenges. UK: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. In proposing this term, White suggested that it is necessary to employ a critical analysis of environmental crime as it occurs in its global context and connections.White, Rob. 2009. Researching Transnational Environmental Harm: Toward an Eco‚ÄêGlobal Criminology. International journal of comparative and applied criminal justice 33, 2: 229-248. Similar to Lynch's political economic approach to green criminology, White has also noted that it is desirable to refer to the political economy of environmental crime, and to social and environmental justice issues. = Green-cultural criminology = As proposed by Avi Brisman and Nigel South Brisman, Avi, and Nigel South. 2013. A green-cultural criminology: An exploratory outline. Crime, Media, Culture 9, 2: 115-135. green-cultural criminology attempts to integrate green and cultural criminology to explore the cultural meaning and significance of terms such as ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù and ‚Äúenvironmental crime.‚Äù Green-cultural criminology goes against traditional approaches in regards to criminology, bringing attention to social harms and social consequences. = Conservation criminology = Conservation criminology is complement to green criminology. Originally proposed by an interdisciplinary group of scholars from the Department of Fisheries & Wildlife, School of Criminal Justice, and Environmental Science & Policy Program at Michigan State University, conservation criminology seeks to overcome limitations inherent to single- discipline science and provide practical guidance about on-the-ground reforms.Gibbs, Carole, Meredith L. Gore, Edmund F. McGarrell, and Louie Rivers. 2010. Introducing conservation criminology towards interdisciplinary scholarship on environmental crimes and risks. British Journal of Criminology 50, 1: 124-144. Conservation criminology is an interdisciplinary and applied paradigm for understanding programs and policies associated with global conservation risks. By integrating natural resources management, risk and decision science, and criminology, conservation criminology-based approaches ideally result in improved environmental resilience, biodiversity conservation, and secure human livelihoods. As an interdisciplinary science, conservation criminology requires the constant and creative combination of theories, methods, and techniques from diverse disciplines throughout the entire processes of research, practice, education, and policy. Thinking about the interdisciplinary nature of conservation criminology can be quite exciting but does require patience and understanding of the different languages, epistemologies and ontologies of the core disciplines. Conservation criminology has been extensively applied to extralegal exploitation of natural resources such as wildlife poaching in Namibia and Madagascar corruption in conservation, e-waste, and general noncompliance with conservation rules. By relying on multiple disciplines, conservation criminology leapfrogs this ideal; it promotes thinking about second- and third-order consequences of risks, not just isolated trends.  Green criminological theory  It is often noted that green criminology is interdisciplinary and as a result, lacks its own unique theory or any preferred theoretical approach. Moreover, significant portions of the green criminological literature are qualitative and descriptive, and those studies have generally not proposed a unique or unifying theory. Despite this general lack of a singular theory, some of the approaches noted above indicate certain theoretical preferences. For example, as noted, the political economic approach to green criminology develops explanations of green crime, victimization and environmental justice consistent with several existing strains of political economic analysis. Beirne's approach takes an interdisciplinary view of theory with respect to various animal rights models and arguments. Clarke's rational choice models of animal poaching and trafficking build on the rational choice tradition found within the criminological literature. To date, these different theoretical approaches have not been examined as competing explanations for green crime and justice, a situation that is found with respect to orthodox or traditional criminological theories of street crime.

The house and demesne were dominant features in the rural landscape of Ireland, throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Location often reflected the distribution of better land, and this is evidenced in mid-Cork, where many of these houses were situated along the valley of the River Lee and its tributaries. Cottage House was once a Pyne family residence. Lewis (1837) describes the parish of Aghabologue as containing numerous large and elegant houses, to include 'the Cottage, of J. Pyne, Esq.' The tithe applotment book for the townland of Clonmoyle East records 'John Pyne, Esq.' as occupying 127 acres. The Landed Estates Database advises that Cottage was originally a Vize residence, and later occupied by the Pyne family, Following the death of John Pyne in 1837, the property was left to his nephew, Reverend John Paul Lawless, 'who took the name and arms of Pyne'. According to the Ordnance Survey name book c. 1840, the townland was the property of Rev. J.L. Pyne and Molly Davis, principally being excellent ground under cultivation, with some bog and furze running through it. Cottage was described as a fine house with good offices attached, built by Rev. John Lawless Pine of Cloyne, and at the time being the residence of Richard Ellard, Esq. A 'good deal' of ornamental ground was said to surround it. By the mid-nineteenth century, the Primary Valuation of Ireland (Griffith's Valuation) records Rev. John Lawless Pine as immediate lessor of the property, which was then unoccupied, and valued at c. ¬£17. Pyne was also recorded as the occupier of c. 1 acre of 'plantation'.

They were therefore entitled to make their pedigrees as Lewknor's heirs as if he had never been attainted, and to make conveyances thereof, except of lordships, honours and other benefits to which their Majesties were entitled on account of the attainder.C.

Marriage and relocation to Suffolk  Dame Susan Lewknor (Denham tomb) Around 1570 Edward married Susan, daughter of Sir Thomas Heigham of Higham Hall, Suffolk and his wife Martha,Hervey, Denham Parish Registers, pp. 192‚Äì97. daughter of Sir Thomas Jermyn of Rushbrooke Hall. While his mother Dorothy Lewknor remained of Kingston Buci, in consequence of his marriage Edward moved to Suffolk, settling at Denham near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, near to Rushbrooke and Higham, and established his family there, where the male line continued in three generations. This placed him firmly within the kinship of the central East Anglian gentry, and, so far as his immediate Jermyn and Heigham relations were concerned, with a group embodying the radical puritan interest in Suffolk. Lewknor assumed this role naturally and energetically: the twin social pillars of the magistracy and ministry working together under the authority of this particular family group (which had a strong parliamentary presence) form the subject of an oft-quoted case-study by Professor Collinson.P. Collinson, '17. Magistracy and Ministry ‚Äì A Suffolk Miniature', in Godly People: Essays on English Protestantism and Puritanism, History Series 23 (Hambledon Press, London 1983), pp. 445-66 (Google preview).

Martha Jermyn's father Sir Thomas died in 1552, and her brother Sir Ambrose Jermyn (died 1577) was reportedly a fervent Roman Catholic and strong persecutor of Protestants in East Anglia during the reign of Queen Mary,P.

Sir Robert himself endowed a Fellowship there, and a lasting connection was begun in which the Lewknors followed.  Parliament  Sir Edward Lewkenor (d. 1605). Lewkenor was sponsored in a successful Parliamentary career by Puritan sympathisers such as the Earl of Leicester, with whose help in 1571 he was elected MP for Tamworth. In 1572 he was elected MP for New Shoreham, near his ancestral domains. He was then elected for Maldon in 1584 and 1586. Lewknor, Sir John Heigham (knighted 1579, MP for Ipswich in 1584 and for Suffolk in 1586J.H., 'Heigham, John (d.1626), of Barrow, Suff.', History of Parliament online) and Sir Robert Jermyn (MP for Suffolk in the same parliamentsN.M. Fuidge, 'Jermyn, Sir Robert (d.1614), of Rushbrooke, Suff.', History of Parliament online) led a strongly Puritan faction in Parliament, often working together in committee, advocating the importance of a learned clergy and the reform of episcopal powers and activities, with which Jermyn in particular came into direct confrontation.Hervey, Denham Parish Registers, pp. 204‚Äì08., where the places in the Journals of Sir Simonds d'Ewes are listed. In 1584 Lewkenor was involved with a bill for the more reverent observation of the Sabbath ‚Äì which, as an intervention in Church affairs, met with royal resistance. Later in that year he served on a committee to consider petitions for the liberties of godly preachers. In 1585 he offered a petition concerning abuses in the ministry on behalf of the people of Sussex, simultaneously overseeing the formulation of an official prayer of thanksgiving to God for the great benefits bestowed upon the realm by Queen Elizabeth, to be used in Parliamentary proceedings. In late 1586, in test or proof of this loyalty, he, Heigham and Jermyn were appointed with others to consider a means by which Mary, Queen of Scots might be brought to the execution of justice.Hervey, Denham Parish Registers, pp. 206‚Äì08. This, however, did not protect him when, in 1587, a revised Book of Common Prayer and accompanying bill were put before the House by Anthony Cope, M.P. for Banbury, Oxfordshire. It was hoped thereby to reform certain problems in ecclesiastical affairs, and the proposer asked for it to be read and to be approved to replace the existing books in all churches. Lewkenor was among those who spoke, solemnly but unsuccessfully, in favour of its reading. These proceedings caused immediate royal disapproval, and when an issue of freedom of speech was raised the Member doing so (Peter Wentworth) was sent to the Tower of London. On the following day Cope and three others including Edward Lewkenor were also imprisoned there. Sir John Heigham and Sir Robert Jermyn were among those appointed 11 days later to consider their release:Hervey, Denham Parish Registers, pp. 208‚Äì10. their durance lasted about a month.  Later life  Lewkenor was not in the Parliament of 1588‚Äì89. In 1589, when he sat for Maldon again, his mother Dorothy Lewknor died at Kingston Buci, making Edward sole executor responsible for her legacies. In these she and he were bound by a recognizance of two thousand marks made with her kinsman Sir Francis Walsingham in 1570, limiting to ¬£1000 any bequests or payments thereof made to unmarried daughters, with which she exactly complied.Will of Dorothy Lewkenor, widow of Kingston Bowsey, Sussex, (P.C.C. 1589).

In the previous year, he once more sitting for Maldon, his mother-in-law Martha Heigham died at Denham, also making Edward her sole executor and leaving him very extensive estates, Denham itself coming to him in Susan's share of the matrilineal inheritance divided between the two Heigham daughters.Will of Martha Heigham, (P.C.C. 1593, Nevill quire), Transcript in Hervey, Denham Parish Registers, pp. 93-100 (Internet Archive). Martha by her will established a scholarship at Emmanuel College (which it fell to Edward Lewknor to implement) on condition that it be enjoyed by Timothy Oldmayne when he should be ready to take it up, which Timothy accordingly did in 1595, proceeding to BA in 1598‚Äì99 and MA in 1602.'Pricke, Timothy', admitted 1595: Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses, Part I Vol. 3 (Cambridge 1924), p. 398 (Internet Archive).

Edward Lewknor was MP for Newport, Cornwall in 1598. He continued active in parliamentary business of various kinds, including the extended consideration of proposed bills for relief of the poor and prevention of idle beggars in November 1597. Having been knighted by King James I in 1603, he was returned as MP for Maldon in 1604, and resumed his intense involvement in questions of church and religion. In particular he strongly advocated that the requirement of subscription should extend only to the Thirty-nine Articles and not to the Prayer-book, so that the \\"godly ministers\\" should not be excluded from the established ministry.A.

Death and exequies  Monument to Edward Lewkenor and his wife The dates of death for Dame Susan (who died first) and Sir Edward vary slightly between the tomb inscription (2 and 3 October), the printed epitaph and the funeral certificate (3 and 4 October). They were buried in St Mary's church, Denham on 5 October 1605, and Sir Edward was succeeded as heir by his elder son Edward Lewknor.A. Thrush, 'Lewknor, Sir Edward I', History of Parliament online. The funeral, which was held on 9 January following, was a formal heraldic occasion, his sons, daughters and sons-in-law attending as mourners, the standard being borne by his sister Mary's son John Machell, and the pennon by Edward as Chief Mourner.D.

The funeral was directed by the Richmond and Somerset Heralds (John Raven and Robert Treswell). The heraldry of the tomb includes as a canopy centrepiece a shield with many quarterings alluding to the ancestry of Lewkenor's great-grandfather, another Sir Edward (d. 1522),Hervey, Denham Parish Registers, pp. 73‚Äì76, & 86‚Äì88.

It is an emblazoning to represent the House of Lewkenor of Kingston Buci in that branch, no additional heraldry being shown for the intervening generations. The meaning and contemporary understanding of this descent is shown in an extensive pedigree drawn up in 1612 and 1615 in the time of the younger Sir Edward Lewkenor,J.J.

The Lewknor descent from a Camoys heir was considered proved, but shown to be from the younger of two sisters. The successful claimant descended from the elder sister. See Howard, The Visitation of Suffolke II, p. 232; Clark & Finnelly, Reports of Cases Heard and Decided, Vol. 6, pp. 789‚Äì867. In an equivalent position at either end of the canopy are impalements showing the same quarterings for Lewkenor (dexter) with eight-quarters for Heigham (sinister). Individual Lewkenor impalements for the marriages of Sir Edward's children are displayed on the transoms of the canopy, those at the eastern side being prepared for the two sons with the sinister pales left invitingly blank. The Latin tomb inscription (no doubt written by his son Edward) refers to his loyal and valuable services for court, parliament and commonwealth, which earned him the approbation of all good men, and his work to introduce the preaching of the Gospel in Denham. The Christian virtues of Dame Susan, her devout modesty, chastity, generosity and kindness to the poor are also commended.

It was announced on 21 February 2014 and began on 18 April 2014, when Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was discovered dead on Walford Common from a deliberately inflicted head injury. The storyline reached a peak during EastEnders Live Week on 19 February 2015, the show's 30th anniversary episode, during which Lucy's brother Bobby is revealed to have killed her following a confrontation at home. Bobby's adoptive mother, Jane Beale, had covered for him, moving Lucy's body to Walford Common and convincing Bobby that he was not responsible for his sister's death. The storyline was revived in July 2015, where it showed how the Beales coped with covering the secret and many locals being wrongfully arrested for committing the crime. The storyline reached another peak in December 2015, when Bobby discovers the truth. The storyline was revisited again in May 2016; when Bobby brutally attacks Jane, and reveals in a busy pub that he killed Lucy and attacked Jane. However, Jane survives the attack ‚Äì although facing potential paralysis ‚Äì and Bobby is arrested; he is later charged for Lucy's murder. The storyline culminated in the 16 June 2016 episode when Bobby is sentenced to three years in custody for killing Lucy and causing grievous bodily harm upon Jane. Although Bobby is jailed for Lucy's murder, the story arc would potentially serve as the catalyst for 2017's central storyline ‚Äì which sees fellow suspect Max Branning (Jake Wood) seeking revenge on the community, particularly Bobby's father Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and his old enemy Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), for allowing him to go to prison for Lucy's murder. The storyline is revisited again from June 2019 when Bobby is released from the young offenders institution. Storyline creation and development The murder story is in the style of a \\"whodunit\\" mystery. Only four members of the show's production team knew who was responsible for Lucy's death. The marketing campaign for the storyline is EastEnders biggest yet; the first specially created trailer aired immediately after the murder. The identity of Lucy's killer was shown in a special live episode marking the 30th anniversary of EastEnders in February 2015. The story, which began on Good Friday 2014, is described by executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins as being \\"emotionally right, true and very exciting\\" and that, after initially deciding on a killer, they came up with an alternative killer early in the planning stages as their initial choice \\"didn't come from the heart\\". In December 2014, it was stated that the list of suspects would be cut down to just 11, although 14 suspects were later revealed on-screen. On 5 January 2015, it was confirmed that the murderer would be revealed in a live flashback episode to mark the anniversary week. =Later development= Lucy's younger brother Bobby Beale was revealed to be the killer on 19 February 2015 in a special flashback episode. Treadwell- Collins mentioned that the killer reveal would be different to the show's predecessing whodunit, \\"Who Killed Archie?\\". \\"With Archie, it was a one-line reveal, but with this one it's more complicated: there are a few conversations.\\" Following the reveal, the executive producer said that the storyline is the \\"start of a bigger story\\". He also mentioned that the original killer was Jane Beale and then Cindy Williams, but stated his reason for the change: \\"There was one other suspect for about a day, but then it didn't feel right. We always said that this story had to come from the heart, and with this, it's the start of a whole big new story for the Beales.\\" Bobby being the culprit was originally suggested by series producer Alex Lamb. On Twitter, Dominic Treadwell-Collins announced that drop-ins were filmed to accompany the recent killer reveal during live week. These scenes aired from 23‚Äì24 February. Suspects and motives For a major part of the storyline, the premise was that every character on the show (except for Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner), who was in prison at the time) could be a suspect. Following the episode that aired on 1 January 2015, the number of official suspects was whittled down to a list of fourteen, when character Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) sent a text message to the person she believed was the killer, with the fourteen characters all being on screen when the message reached its unspecified recipient's phone. By the end of January, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) no longer appeared as a suspect in promotional material ahead of the anniversary episode, bringing the list of suspects down to thirteen. On 20 February 2015, it was revealed that Emma had sent the text message to Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), who was in fact covering for her adoptive son, Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington). *Ian Beale, played by Adam Woodyatt. In the days leading up to Lucy's death, Ian was troubled by his daughter's behaviour and Cindy, jealous of Ian favouring Lucy over herself, revealed that Lucy had a secret stash of cocaine hidden in her jewellery box. After a heated argument, Ian told Lucy that she was his favourite child as Peter overheard, running off as Lucy chased after him. Ian stated in his alibi that he was at the restaurant the night she died, but Cindy mentioned that she went there to look for him and he was not there. He was in fact with Rainie Cross, a prostitute. *Jane Beale, played by Laurie Brett. Jane had been staying at her friend Masood's house over Easter. She claimed not to have left the house, but provided Lauren with an alibi after claiming that she had seen Lauren approach the Beale house and then leave moments later without entering. *Peter Beale, played by Ben Hardy. On the night of Lucy's death, Peter overheard his father Ian tell Lucy that she was his favourite child. He ran out, stating in his alibi that he needed some time alone. Prior to the murder, it was revealed that Lucy had been taking cocaine. Jane reads out the texts on Lucy's phone including an unsent message to Peter on the night of her death asking for drugs. He later confesses to being her drug dealer, making sure he can control her addiction. *Abi Branning, played by Lorna Fitzgerald. Max received an anonymous email of a picture of him kissing Lucy, which was later revealed to have been sent by Abi. She was very unstable during her police interview, and stated in her alibi that she was at home with her father Max all night, but was left alone briefly when Max went out to walk the dog. On Halloween 2014, Abi stalked her sister Lauren wearing a Weeping Angel mask when she became uncomfortable with Lauren dismissing her problems in favour of her own. During a heated confrontation, Abi tries to drown Lauren. She later denies killing Lucy, but admits that she wishes that she had. *Max Branning, played by Jake Wood. Prior to Good Friday, it was revealed that Max had been having an affair with Lucy. A few days before her death, the pair had a heated argument, resulting in Lucy falling and hitting her head and he later grabbed her aggressively. Both incidents were captured on CCTV footage and reviewed by David. David originally blamed Max for the murder, but after the two talk, David decides to keep quiet about the incidents and the laptop containing the evidence is destroyed. Max stated in his alibi that he was at home all night except for when he left for five minutes to walk the dog, which was later confirmed by an anxious Abi, after her maternal grandmother, Cora, called the police after noticing Max and Abi cleaning up Lucy's blood from the car lot. *Jay Brown, played by Jamie Borthwick. Although no given motive has presented itself, CCTV footage revealed that Jay was on the same bus as Lucy the night that she was murdered, and was shown to have followed her after she got off. He burned the hat that he was wearing in the footage, and later buried Lucy's purse and phone. *Lee Carter, played by Danny-Boy Hatchard. Lee had a fling with Lucy in the days running up to her death, upsetting love rival Whitney. In his alibi, Lee stated that he was at the housewarming party at the time of the death. Before the party he had seen Billy in a heated argument with Lucy. *Les Coker, played by Roger Sloman. In Les' alibi, he states that he was watching \\"a Marlon Brando classic\\". Les runs a funeral business, and was heavily involved in faking the death of Nick Cotton before he was questioned by the police. *Pam Coker, played by Lin Blakley. On the anniversary of her son's death, she became worried when Emma asked her questions surrounding Lucy's death. She later revealed to Billy that she had killed someone. *Whitney Dean, played by Shona McGarty. Whitney developed feelings for Lee, but on the day of Lucy's death, discovered that the two had slept together. Whitney and Lucy were also involved in cyber-bullying conflicts on a social networking site in which Lucy supposedly made remarks about Whitney's weight. At Lucy's funeral, Whitney leaves a message saying \\"Rot in Hell\\" which is found by Tamwar. Whitney asked Lauren for the password to Lucy's profile, telling her that she wanted to delete the hate off of Lucy's profile, though deleted all of the messages, including ones that Whitney and Lucy shared. Later, DI Keeble notices suspicious activity which arose on Lauren's laptop in the run-up to Lucy's death, referring to the deletion of a conversation that happened between Whitney and Lucy. *Denise Fox, played by Diane Parish. On the day of Lucy's death, Denise revealed to her daughter Libby that she was planning on leaving Ian, sick of him favouring his own family over hers. However, after learning about Lucy's death, she chose to stay with him, though eventually left him after learning of his involvement with Rainie. A few months later, she dug up Lucy's purse and phone in Patrick's allotments. She was initially hesitant about turning them over to Ian, but did after being urged to by Masood. *Ben Mitchell, played by Harry Reid. Ben is Lucy's uncle. He returned to the square five months after Lucy's death and thus had not been questioned by the police. For unknown reasons, Ben possessed Lucy's missing phone and purse, and ordered Jay to dispose of them. When Denise accidentally dug them up, Ben claimed to Ian that he had found them on Good Friday, and then disposed of them after learning of Lucy's death. *Cindy Williams, played by Mimi Keene. In the days running up to the murder, Cindy got increasingly jealous of Ian treating her poorly. Cindy told Ian that Lucy had something hidden in her jewellery box, which was later revealed to be cocaine, given to Lucy by her twin brother, Peter. On Christmas Day, Cindy unwrapped the jewellery box which was under the tree, noted as a present for her daughter Beth. The following were listed as suspects prior to January 2015 and had been questioned by the police: *Lauren Branning, played by Jacqueline Jossa. Lucy's best friend. Lauren was uncharacteristically happy to dismiss Lucy's emotional state during their final scene. She stated that she went to Ronnie and Roxy's housewarming party then returned straight home, but video evidence contradicted her story, showing her heading to the Beale house. Jane provides Lauren with an alibi, revealing that from the Masood house, she saw Lauren arrive and leave the Beale house without entering. *Linda Carter, played by Kellie Bright. Linda is the mother of suspect Lee, and had disapproved of him sleeping with Lucy on the night before her death. *Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer. Mick found out about his son Lee and Lucy's relationship in the days running up to the murder. At the time of her death, Mick was hosting a pool tournament at The Queen Victoria public house. *Charlie Cotton, played by Declan Bennett. Upon Charlie's arrival, he had a deal in hand with fellow resident Les concerning the faking of his father's death. He was questioned by the police following the incident. *Billy Mitchell, played by Perry Fenwick. Billy was originally going into business with Lucy, but it was later revealed that she was playing him. Later in the storyline, Lee revealed that he had seen Billy in a heated confrontation with Lucy hours before her death, but was unsure if Billy had followed her or not. He and Lola were attending the wedding of Ronnie and Charlie when Emma met with the supposed killer. *Lola Pearce, played by Danielle Harold. Lola became increasingly jealous of her boyfriend Peter's involvement in his sister's life. She and Billy were attending the wedding of Ronnie and Charlie when Emma met with the supposed killer. *Jake Stone, played by Jamie Lomas. In the days running up to Good Friday, Jake had fallen in love with Lucy. Lucy's blood was found in Jake's flat and he was arrested, but he was later released when a witness backed up Jake's story that he had been drunk and that Lucy helped him home. *Dean Wicks, played by Matt Di Angelo. Dean was questioned by the police following the murder. Plot =Events leading up to the murder= Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) decides to set up a letting agency, despite cynicism from her father, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Her former colleague Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) offers to be her business partner but she turns him down in favour of her friend, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa). It is revealed that Lucy is secretly having a sexual relationship with Lauren's father Max Branning (Jake Wood). She also has sex with Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard), despite being aware that Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) harbours romantic feelings for Lee. Lucy's behaviour with Lee causes tension between her and Max; during a disagreement in Max's car showroom, Lucy trips and falls, resulting in a minor injury to her head. She then ends her relationship with Max, and continues her relationship with Lee. Max receives an anonymous email that states, \\"What have you been doing?\\" and contains a photograph of him and Lucy embracing. Lucy's half-sister, Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene) becomes jealous of Lucy being Ian's favourite. On Good Friday, Cindy tells Ian and Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) to open Lucy's jewellery box. They find a bag of cocaine inside. The revelation prompts Ian to cancel a planned trip with his fianc√©e Denise Fox (Diane Parish) to Oxford to see her daughter Libby (Belinda Owusu), upsetting Denise. Ian and Jane catch Lee and Lucy having sex in Ian's restaurant. Ian confronts Lucy about the cocaine but she runs off. She goes to the Branning's house to work with Lauren, but leaves after having words with Max. She later returns to speak to Ian, who tells Lucy that she has always been his favourite child. Lucy's twin brother Peter Beale (Ben Hardy) overheard this, and storms off. Lucy is furious with Ian and leaves to find Peter. In The Queen Victoria public house, Whitney is upset when she finds out about Lee and Lucy's relationship. In the Square, Lucy sees her friends going to Ronnie (Samantha Womack) and Roxy Mitchell's (Rita Simons) house-warming party. Lauren urges her to join them, failing to notice that Lucy is upset, while Whitney shoots angry glares at her. Lucy bumps into Max again rebuffing his advances; he grabs her violently by the wrist. Lucy reads a text and leaves Albert Square for an unknown location. Lucy begins to walk towards the bus stop, texting Peter to ask for cocaine (he later buys some, but keeps it for himself). On her journey, she passes by her father's chip shop, where she spots Billy stealing fish during his shift. She confronts him and says that she's going to tell Ian. He follows her, grabs her by the wrist and begs her to keep quiet, before suggesting that he fancies her. Disgusted, Lucy heads off towards the bus stop, but is stopped by Lee, who has seen her argument with Billy. He encourages her to join him at the house-warming party, and Lucy agrees to join him later, but must go to show a buyer one of her flats first. Lucy boards the Number 30 bus, and is followed by Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick). Jay meets with Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), who has just been released from prison following the death of Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison). Ben surprises Lucy at the flat, and confronts her about not giving him money that she had originally promised, as he had planned to move to Miami. An intoxicated Jake Stone (Jamie Lomas) is revealed to be the potential buyer, but he admits he was only there in hopes of rekindling his romance with Lauren, who he had expected to be showing him the flat. Lucy and Jake take an unlicensed taxi, driven by Arsim Kelmendi (Tomasz Aleksander) back to Walford. While out walking his dog, Max spots Lucy struggling to carry Jake back to his flat and reluctantly agrees to help. Max's other daughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) watches on, believing they're about to continue their sexual relationship. Once in the flat, Max goads Jake, who attempts to punch him. He misses Max and instead hits Lucy, causing her nose to bleed and her earring to fall out. Lucy goes into the bathroom to clean herself up, and Max tells her that their relationship doesn't have to end but Lucy rebuffs him. She leaves the flat but is robbed of her purse and phone by Ben, who has followed her back to Walford. Lucy begins to walk home and meets Abi, who expresses her disgust at her relationship with her father, and proceeds to slap her. Lucy arrives on the Square, where Jane rushes over to talk to her. Lucy then tells Jane that she has had a terrible night, and asks her to resume living at the Beale house. Jane reminds Lucy about her father's engagement to Denise, but Lucy doesn't believe that they are happy, and asks Jane to be a mother-figure to her once again. Jane says that she doesn't want to return home, but Lucy misinterprets this as Jane rejecting her, and goes home. She then overhears Denise talking to her daughter Chelsea Fox (Tiana Benjamin) on the phone, and discovers that Denise plans to leave Ian. Lucy confronts Denise, and they engage in a bitter fight which is overheard by Lucy's youngest brother Bobby (Eliot Carrington). The fight culminates with Lucy slapping Denise and Denise pinning Lucy down on the floor. Elsewhere, Cindy heads to the restaurant looking for Ian, but after not finding him there, leaves a voicemail message for Lucy asking whether she will come home that night. She narrowly misses Lucy and heads to bed with Bobby who feigns being asleep. While jogging, Peter considers returning to the Beale house, but instead returns to Billy's bedsit. Lucy meanwhile sits outside on the street after brawling with Denise, distraught that her life has crumbled around her, as a jealous Whitney looks on. Lee leaves a voicemail for Lucy asking when he will see her, before returning to the party. Ian returns home after sleeping with prostitute Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) and also leaves a message for Lucy, telling her that he's sorry. Lucy goes home and begins writing a letter in the living room. As she does, she is startled by someone when the floorboards creak, and she sees her assailant. Shortly afterwards, Jane receives a panicked phone call, and rushes over to the Beale house, where she sees the door is open. She walks in to find Lucy lying on the living room floor. Jane checks her pulse and is distraught to realise that Lucy is dead. She turns around to find Bobby, who tells her that \\"Whatever she [Lucy] says, she started it. She made everyone unhappy\\". Jane realises that Bobby is responsible as he is holding Lucy's jewellery box, the one which she stored cocaine in, having used it to hit Lucy with. Jane convinces Bobby that he has done nothing wrong, and reassuring him that Lucy will be fine, sends him to bed. Jane contemplates taking Lucy to the hospital, but when she is unnerved at the devastation it could cause, she instead puts Lucy in the boot of her car, and takes her to Walford Common. Jane says her goodbyes to Lucy and leaves her body. =Investigation following Lucy's death= The next morning, Lucy's body is discovered by a young girl walking with her grandfather on Walford Common. DC Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) and DS Cameron Bryant (Glen Wallace) visit Ian to inform him they have found Lucy's body. Ian is inconsolable as he identifies her body and breaks the news to Jane, Denise, Cindy, Bobby and, later, Peter. It is revealed Lucy died because of a deliberate head injury. The police question the family and search Lucy's bedroom. Cindy tells Ian that Lucy was an habitual user of cocaine. Ian says that he was at his restaurant the previous evening, but Cindy says she went there and did not see him. Ian laments that he did not know his daughter at all and furiously throws Cindy out, forcing her to return to Devon. The police take a DNA sample from Lee before he returns to Afghanistan. Summerhayes returns to say that there has been a leak at the police station and the press have got hold of some vital information. It is explained that there was very little blood found at the common, meaning that Lucy was not killed in a mugging, but was murdered elsewhere, then dumped on the Common. Her purse and phone are also missing. David Wicks (Michael French) discovers Max's sexual relationship with Lucy and accuses him of killing her. Max denies it but David later finds CCTV footage of Max and Lucy arguing on the night of her death. David does not tell the police because he is worried that if Max is questioned it will affect the health of his cancer-stricken fianc√©e Carol Jackson (Lindsay Coulson), who is Max's sister. He says that he does not believe Max killed her and together they burn all computer evidence of the footage. When Lauren reopens LB Lettings for business, she discovers the email intended for her but read by Lucy on the night of her death. The sender is asking that they meet and Lauren suspects it was sent by Lucy's killer. She takes the information to the police but they tell her they are already looking into the matter. Lauren arranges to meet the person herself at a cafe on Walford Common and is stunned to discover it is her former lover, Jake. Jake says that he sent Lauren the email, hoping to reconcile with Lauren and used a false name, guessing she would not reply if she knew it was from him. He arranged to meet her at the cafe, but instead found Lucy there. Jake explains he was very drunk and Lucy accompanied him back to Walford in an unlicensed taxi. He cannot remember any more details. Lauren does not believe him and suspects he made a pass at Lucy, was rejected, he lashed out and killed her. Lauren visits the police again. The police arrest Jake after finding Lucy's blood and one of her earrings in his flat. He is later charged with her murder. On the day of Lucy's funeral, Max's youngest daughter, Abi, tells Max that she knew about his sexual relationship with Lucy and that it was she who sent the email and photograph. The relationship is made public and he is ostracised by the residents of Walford. Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) is also concerned when she overhears Cindy talking to Ian about his false alibi. After the funeral, Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel) finds a note in the church to Lucy, \\"ROT IN HELL\\". He recognises the handwriting as Whitney's and confronts her. Whitney claims that Lucy had been relentlessly cyber-bullying her about her weight and appearance. She admits that she hated Lucy, but denies killing her. Tamwar agrees not to say anything. Following the funeral, Jane decides to take Bobby back to Cardiff with her, wanting to give him a new start away from the shadow of Lucy's death. Curious about Ian's false alibi, Sharon and her boyfriend Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) decide to visit Jake in prison and begin to believe that he might be innocent. When they question Ian, he assures them that he is not involved with Lucy's death in any way. Peter discovers that Sharon and Phil are doubting Jake's guilt, so asks Lauren to visit Jake in prison. He tries to find the taxi driver who brought Jake and Lucy back to Walford. Lauren starts to reassess Jake's guilt and joins Peter in the search for the taxi driver, believing that Jake was too drunk to have committed the murder. Max tells Lauren that he saw Jake and Lucy together on Good Friday, and claims that Jake was sober but he has not informed the police. Max also tells Abi about the altercation he had with Lucy in the car showroom and a worried Abi cleans Lucy's blood from the car showroom floor, worried it will implicate Max. Abi claims that Max was at home with her on the night of the killing. When Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) sees this, she informs the police that Max has new information. Emma returns to clarify Max and Abi's new statements and Max flirts with her and they have sex. Lauren tracks down Kelmendi, who tells her that Jake was too drunk to stand on the night of Lucy's death, but he refuses to make a statement to the police. Lauren realises that Max lied about Jake being sober. Peter becomes more obsessed than ever about finding Lucy's killer. Ian starts receiving several phone calls and texts from a mysterious \\"R\\". Becoming more irate, Ian tells the contact not to contact him again. It is later revealed that \\"R\\" is Rainie, who is blackmailing Ian because he was having sex with her on the night of Lucy's murder, thus confirming that Cindy was telling the truth about Ian having a false alibi. When Lee returns to Walford, he tells his family that he saw Billy arguing with Lucy on the night she was murdered. Lee confronts Billy who confesses to stealing fish from Ian's fish and chip shop, and using a key to enter Jake's flat to steal electricity. He claims that Lucy caught him stealing the fish and threatened to tell Ian. Phil encourages Billy to go to the police and frame Peter, but Billy cannot go through with this. After Billy makes a statement, Jake is released from prison without charge. Billy faces hostility from the Beales and is also confronted by Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) who finds photographs of Lucy underneath his fridge. Billy tells her the photographs are Peter's, but later bins them after telling Pam he would return them. The police say that they are still looking for Lucy's purse and mobile phone. The police ask Ian to do a press appeal after the investigation stalls and televise new CCTV footage from the night of Lucy's death, showing her on a bus. It is discovered that on the night of her death, Lucy went to some flats to see a client who has now been eliminated from the police inquiry. Ian struggles to cope when he is hounded by the press and the police do not intervene. Phil believes that the police suspect Ian is hiding something and demands that he tell him what it is. Ian admits to Phil that he was with Rainie. The CCTV footage shows a man wearing a West Ham beanie hat getting off the bus at the same stop as Lucy. Police say they are looking for this person. Jay has the hat and burns it. Jay is questioned by the police but not charged. He and Ian's half-brother, Phil's son Ben were robbing a shop near Walford Common on the night of Lucy's death. It is revealed that Jay buried Lucy's missing purse and phone at the allotments on Ben's instructions. Emma is removed from the case when her sexual relationship with Max is exposed. Lauren is repeatedly followed by DS Bryant acting under the orders of the head of the investigation DI Samantha Keeble (Alison Newman). Denise finds Lucy's phone and purse buried in Patrick Trueman's (Rudolph Walker) allotment. Realising what Denise has found, Jay and Ben panic and unsuccessfully try to steal them back. Denise returns the phone and purse to Ian, and fearing that Ian will turn them over to the police, Ben confesses to Ian that he found a bag containing a phone and purse abandoned on Good Friday, but denies seeing Lucy or realising that they were hers until after learning of her death. Ian phones the police, but Ben pleads his innocence and Ian decides to not report this development, asking Jane to keep the items safe. Ian scrolls through the messages on Lucy's phone and finds a pending text to Peter asking for cocaine. Ian confronts Peter upon his return from a trip to New Zealand, just as he is proposing to Lauren, and Peter admits that he had been supplying Lucy with cocaine before her death in a bid to protect her from dangerous drug dealers. Lauren rejects Peter's proposal and Ian briefly disowns Peter, but they later reconcile. Lee views a video of Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) taken on the night of the murder and spots Lauren heading to the Beale house, contradicting her alibi. He anonymously turns over the footage to Emma, who questions Lauren. Lauren admits that she went to see Lucy, but left without seeing her. Jane later backs Lauren up, claiming to have seen her leave the Beale house without entering from a window in the Masood house. Shortly before Christmas, Jane and Ian resume their romantic relationship, and Jane proposes to Ian. They plan their wedding for February. Although no longer a policewoman, Emma continues to study her police files. Shortly after Christmas, she seemingly cracks the case, and contacts a mystery person, telling them that she has figured out that they killed Lucy. On New Year's Day, she arranges to meet the person in the park and urges them to go to the police. The unseen person leaves and Emma sends them a text message, saying that she can't keep their secret. Distracted, Emma wanders into the road and is hit by Roxy's car. Although she initially appears to be unharmed, Emma later starts bleeding from her ear and collapses. Max takes her to the hospital, but Emma dies from her injuries. Carol finds a grief-stricken Max tearing up Emma's file on Lucy. Lauren retrieves the papers from the bin and sets about trying to restore the torn-up pieces. A few weeks later, after proposing to Peter, Lauren finds a missing scrap of paper in her kitchen, and after putting it with the rest of the work, realises some startling information on what happened to Lucy. Deeply disturbed by her discovery, Lauren begins rejecting those around her and breaks her sobriety. Her erratic behaviour is spotted by Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner), and Lauren admits her concerns that she might be pregnant. She takes a pregnancy test, which turns out to be positive. She later shares her belief that she knows what happened to Lucy. Stacey calls the police but Lauren keeps silent about her theory, handing over Emma's files, but retaining the crucial evidence. She kicks Stacey out of her house, and breaks off her engagement to Peter. An emotional Lauren gets a wedding card for Ian and Jane, in which she writes \\"I know what happened to Lucy. She died at home.\\" She addresses the card to Jane and leaves it in the Beale house on the day of the wedding. Peter finds her, and confronts her about their break-up, but Lauren leaves, refusing to speak to him. Moments before the ceremony is due to begin, Jane finds the card and is visibly shaken. She struggles to recite her vows to Ian, but the pair eventually remarry. Elsewhere, Stacey informs Max of Lauren's discovery and he begins a frantic search across Walford to find her. Lauren returns home and plans to leave Walford, but Max arrives and tries to stop her. Abi interrupts their conversation, allowing Lauren the opportunity to escape. Abi accuses her sister of attention seeking, but Max informs her that Lauren has figured out who killed Lucy, and accuses Abi of being the killer. Abi admits that she fought with Lucy the night she died, but denies killing her, though admits wishing that she had. After learning of Lauren's pregnancy, Max races to the hospital and attempts to talk her out of having an abortion, but she sends him away. Peter also learns of Lauren's plan, and confronts her. She reveals that she has figured out that Lucy died at home. At the wedding reception, a troubled Jane returns home. She contacts Masood, and asks him to take Bobby (now Elliot Carrington) to his house overnight. Masood is confused but noticing how distressed Jane is, agrees to look after Bobby. Ian returns home looking for Jane, while Peter return to The Vic and drags Cindy home. There, he reveals Lauren's discovery and questions the family about their involvement. Realising that Denise was home all night, Ian heads out to find her, but is sidetracked when Martin Fowler (James Bye) informs him of the discovery of Nick Cotton's (John Altman) body. Ian speaks to Dot Branning (June Brown), who confesses that she allowed Nick to die. Ian realises that Lucy may not have been killed out of hate, and tells Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) that he's putting the final pieces of the puzzle together. Peter spots Denise on the Square and accuses her of killing Lucy, but Ian intervenes and protests Denise's innocence. He then phones home and makes an ambiguous call, instructing the person to get everyone else out of the house because he has figured out what happened. When he returns, Jane is home alone. Ian demands to know what happened, and covering for Bobby, Jane lies and claims to have accidentally killed Lucy during an argument. Ian smashes up the kitchen in rage, attracting the attention of Peter and Cindy. The three confront Jane, but Ian begins to suspect that she is lying, realising that her story makes little sense. From Masood's house, Bobby tries to contact Jane, and Ian realises that Jane is covering for him. Jane crumbles, and admits that on Good Friday, Bobby phoned her in a panic and when she came to the Beale house, she found him standing over Lucy's lifeless body. She reveals that Bobby was frustrated with Lucy for all the trouble she was causing, and after confronting her, lashed out after failing to get through to her. Jane explains that after realising what had happened, she convinced Bobby that he wasn't responsible for Lucy's death and that he is under the belief that Lucy went back out after their argument and was later killed by someone else. Jane also reveals that Emma met her on New Year's Day and was having a hard time deciding whether to reveal the truth. Peter lashes out at Jane and accuses her of betraying Lucy's memory, while Jane protests that Bobby didn't mean to hurt Lucy. They are disturbed when Cindy brings Bobby home, and after seeing his son, Ian decides to keep the circumstances of Lucy's death a secret. He forgives Jane and insists that the family all rally around and keep the secret. Peter refuses, but Cindy empathises with Jane. Hearing the commotion downstairs, Bobby comes down resulting in Peter angrily leaving. Bobby reveals to Cindy that he has kept the letter that Lucy was writing safe since learning about her death. Cindy reveals its contents to the family: Lucy wrote to Ian, telling him that she was sorry for her behaviour and that she wants to change. She tells Ian that she's going to bed, but when he returns home to wake her up so she can tell him that she loves him. An emotional Ian gathers Jane, Cindy and Bobby and the family embrace. Peter leaves the Square and moves to New Zealand with Lauren after telling her that Bobby was the one who killed Lucy and that Jane covered for him. She agrees to keep it a secret. Five months later, the police arrest Ben on suspicion of the murder. Jane shows Ian that she has kept Lucy's phone and wallet, but they agree to keep them hidden to ensure Ben's release. However, Bobby overhears them talking about Ben, so he takes the items to the police. Phil finds him there and stops him, but later believes that Ben may have killed Lucy, so hands the items to the police himself. The Mitchells hear of this and are angry that Phil did not wipe the fingerprints off the items, and Jay believes he will also be implicated, which he is. As a result, Jay receives a three-month suspended sentence and is tagged. However, Abi then tells Phil that she believes Max may have killed Lucy, so Sharon drives her to the police station. Despite being innocent, Max hands himself into the police. Later that day, Max is arrested and charged with Lucy's murder after her blood is found on his shoes (blood from her nosebleed which occurred when Jake hit her), and Ben is released. Ben is furious that Phil handed the items into the police, while Stacey visits Max in prison where he reveals that he believes that Abi killed Lucy. Stacey confronts Abi, which leads to a bitter fight between the pair. Max informs Carol that Abi had attacked Lucy violently on the night of the murder, which is why he thinks she killed her. After confronting Abi, Carol visits the Beales and vows to do all she can to help Max get released from prison and find the real killer. Jane cannot deal with her guilt as she watches Carol fall apart over Max's arrest, and begins helping her by aiding her look for a solicitor and helping her search for Cora, who has been missing for months. Jane tells Carol she knows that Max did not kill Lucy, leading to Carol becoming suspicious. Jane is adamant that she is going to confess to Carol that Bobby killed Lucy, however Ian persuades her not to. After Bobby attempts to throw a brick through Max's car windscreen, Cindy shouts at him at home, leading to him pushing her over; she lands where Jane found Lucy dead on the night of the murder. When Abi and Carol find Cora, Jane decides she will tell Carol that Bobby killed Lucy, but when Cora says she saw Abi and Max cleaning Lucy's blood off the car lot floor after she died, Abi admits that Max and Lucy argued there and that the evidence is stacked strongly against Max. Back at the Beale household, Cindy‚Äîbelieving that Ian and Jane have told Carol and Abi the truth‚Äîtells her boyfriend and Carol's grandson Liam Butcher (James Forde) that Bobby killed Lucy. Cindy learns that Ian and Jane did not tell Carol, and Ian persuades Liam not to reveal the secret, arranging for Cindy and Liam to move to Devon permanently. Cindy and Liam decide not to leave Walford, and Liam attempts to call the police on Bobby, but Ian states that he and Cindy could go to prison for perverting the course of justice. Liam blackmails Ian and Jane into giving him ¬£100,000 to leave permanently, saying he will go to Germany to live with his father, but Liam eventually agrees to leave without payment. Jane tells Ian that she intends for all the Beales to move away from Walford, but instead, Liam and Cindy leave together without Jane and the others. Cindy sends a video message to Bobby informing him that he killed Lucy and that Jane lied. Sharon watches the message on Bobby's laptop and hides it from Bobby, and later confronts Jane about it. Eventually, Jane confirms to Sharon that Bobby killed Lucy, while Ian deletes the email. Ian pleads with Sharon to keep the information a secret for the sake of his family, but Sharon says she needs time to think about what to do. Sharon decides not to tell Phil the truth about the murder and tells Ian that she will not tell anybody. She later asks Ian and Jane what to expect at Max's trial, after hearing that Ben, Jay, Abi and Lee have all been called to give evidence, so Jane contacts Keeble. Ian, however, visits Dot who says that she wishes she had turned her criminal son, Nick, into the police when he was younger, so Ian takes Bobby away in the middle of the night. The next day, Jane is frantic to discover that Ian and Bobby are nowhere to be seen, so she visits Sharon, who covers for her when Phil starts asking questions. Jane is intent on giving an alibi for Max to his lawyer Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett)‚Äîwho also has history with Phil and Sharon‚Äîhowever Sharon strongly advises Jane against the idea. After a day of worrying, Jane eventually decides to contact Keeble and say that she killed Lucy, however Phil grabs her from behind and stops her from answering the door to Keeble. Keeble eventually leaves, and Phil tells Jane he knows she killed Lucy. She lies that she had an argument with Lucy over drugs. Phil vents his anger over Ben's arrest, and Jane lets slip she is covering for Bobby. Phil is stunned. When Sharon arrives, she tries to convince Phil not to call the police, but when he gets his mobile phone out, Jane punches him out of desperation and expresses how much she loves Bobby. Phil and Sharon convince her to continue protecting Bobby and allow Max to stand trial as Bobby is more important to her than Max is. Jane contacts Ian and Bobby, who are in Kent, and reveals that she will be joining them. =Max's trial and Kathy's return= Jane is stunned when Lauren returns and reveals that she knows that Bobby killed Lucy. She pleads with Lauren to stay quiet, however Lauren is determined to have Max released. At court, Lee takes to the stand and Marcus questions his recent sacking from the army due to violent behaviour, leading to Lee breaking down in tears. However, the prosecution, Hazel Warren (Clare Higgins), points out Marcus's character assassination on Lee. Lauren then decides to tell Jane that she is informing the police of the real killer, but as she leaves the house, her waters break. The following day, Abi is questioned in the docks, and is disgusted when she realises that Max has told Marcus about her fight with Lucy on the night she died. In pure anger, Abi lies that Max revealed to her that he killed Lucy. Abi later feels guilty and confesses to lying, and is shunned by the judge. When Lauren brings her baby Louie home, Carol tells her and Abi about how Max has always been a coward, so Lauren visits Max in prison. He reveals that he was planning to write Abi a letter of apology, and swears that Marcus forced him to confess about Abi and Lucy's fight. Lauren, seeing what Carol pointed out, urges Max to stand up for himself if he wants to prove his innocence. Max begins to suspect that Lauren knows more than she is letting on and questions her how she knows he didn't do it if she has a low opinion of him. Lauren does not answer and leaves the prison silently. After Lauren and Abi are horrified when Max once again fails to defend Abi when accusations of her killing Lucy arise in court, Lauren warns Jane not to give evidence as planned, feeling that Max needs to defend himself. After failing to convince Carol to help Max defend himself, Marcus tries to contact Jane, who avoids him because of Lauren's warning. When the prosecution lawyer, Hazel, verbally attacks Max, Carol, who had until this point, lost faith in his innocence, finally agrees to help and encourages Marcus to interrogate him about his abusive childhood that caused his insecurities. Marcus and Jane then secretly come up with a plan to ensure Max will be found innocent. Jane then travels to court the following day and tells the jury that she and Max had sex when Lucy was murdered, though Hazel believes this is just a lie to ensure Max is found not guilty, because Jane had not mentioned this previously. Later, Jane pleads with Phil to help Max and he privately confronts the foreman of the jury in his car. The foreman later states in court that the jury have found Max guilty, which Ian briefly witnesses from outside. As a horrified Carol and Stacey protest, proclaiming his innocence, Max jumps out from his stand, punches Bryant, and quickly escapes the courthouse. Max visits Jane and realises she is covering for Bobby. When Max is rearrested, he shouts that Bobby killed Lucy but it is seen as an act of desperation. Max is sentenced to 20 years for the murder and a further 12 months for escaping lawful custody. Lauren then goes to the police and tells Bryant that it is true that Bobby killed Lucy, but Bryant does not believe her and says that Max deserves what he gets for what happened to Emma. After returning to Walford with Bobby, Ian leaves Jane a suicide note saying he killed Lucy. When Jane finds Ian about to jump off a bridge, he tells her that this is the only way to protect everyone. However, Jane talks him down and he is then surprised to see his supposedly dead mother, Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth), on the other side of the road. Ian later tells Kathy that Bobby killed Lucy, rebuilding their trust. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Bobby protests over Ian and Jane's decision to move him into Lucy's old bedroom while Kathy moves into his bedroom. After unsuccessfully trying to swap the rooms back, Bobby pushes Jane down the stairs during a scuffle, knocking her unconscious. Jane lies to Kathy that she tripped, but Bobby tells Kathy the truth. Kathy tries to convince Jane that Bobby has anger management problems, and after Bobby later smashes a plate in anger, Jane expresses her concerns to Kathy that Bobby may well have anger issues. Bobby and Sharon's son Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau) start a feud, leading to Kathy telling Sharon that Bobby pushed Jane down the stairs. Sharon decides to go to the police, so Jane tells Ian of Sharon's plan. Dennis tells Bobby that he killed Lucy, having overheard it from Sharon and Phil. Sharon then has second thoughts after her father and Kathy's husband Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) tells her not to destroy a family. Bobby and Dennis go for a bike ride to Walford Common, so Phil and Ian go looking for them. They find Dennis brutally beaten, while Bobby's return home means Sharon thinks he has harmed Dennis. A distracted and drunk Phil crashes the car, leaving Phil and Ian with cuts and bruises and Dennis in a critical condition. Ian realises Phil was drunk, and when speaking to Jane, also realises Dennis must have told Bobby he killed Lucy. Ian then does a deal with Phil: stop Sharon going to the police about Bobby and Ian will say he drove the car, saving Phil's relationship with Sharon, but ending his own friendship with her. When Bobby throws his television down the stairs, he tells Ian what Dennis told him. Ian confirms that he did kill Lucy but everyone is protecting him out of love. Ian tells Jane, who decides it is time to go to the police. Bobby agrees he should face the police, but Ian decides that a private boarding school will be another way to help him, while keeping the family intact. When Phil confesses to Sharon that he was driving the car, Sharon leaves him and reconciles with Ian. Ian is able to get Bobby into boarding school early, and Bobby sees this as his punishment for killing Lucy, but he is reassured by Kathy. =Killer confession and Max's revenge= Ian decides to sell his restaurant to pay for Bobby's schooling, which causes protests when it is revealed he is selling to a supermarket chain. Because of this, Ian changes his mind and decides to take Bobby out of the school. Bobby overhears Jane talking to Sharon about this and is angry, so Bobby smashes Jane's car with his hockey stick. A day later, Jane catches Bobby packing a bag. Stating he overheard Jane's conversation with Sharon and he is going back to boarding school, he attempts to run out the front door; Jane drags him back and as she turns around to call Ian, Bobby strikes her over the head with his hockey stick, then twice more after she falls. Bobby interrupts Ian in a crowded Queen Vic and says that he has killed Jane, just like he killed Lucy. Ian, Sharon, Kathy and Ben rush to Jane's aid, and discover she is alive. The crowd in the pub wonder if Bobby is telling the truth or if he is confused. Ben realises that the family knew for some time and is angry because he was arrested for the murder, but tells Ian to get Bobby away to avoid him going to prison. Ian tells Bobby to change his bloodied shirt and they leave as paramedics arrive. However, Mick stops Ian leaving, as he recalls his earlier conversation with Ian and realises that Ian knew Bobby killed Lucy. Mick convinces Ian to return to Jane, and Ian does not allow Bobby in the ambulance. While being questioned about the attack on Jane, Bobby confesses to killing Lucy. Keeble is reluctant to reopen the case, having put a lot of effort into convicting Max; however, when Bobby reveals where the murder weapon is, Bobby is charged with unlawful killing and remanded into custody. Despite Ian's pleas, Jane decides to end their marriage, believing that the Beale family are better off without her and fearing she may be paralysed following Bobby's attack. Bobby is later sentenced to three years in prison for Lucy's murder. Max is due to have a hearing to be released from prison following Bobby's confession, so Abi and Lauren write a letter to reconcile with him and to meet in The Queen Vic which they give to Stacey, who goes to the court. However, after being released, he posts it back through the letterbox and gets into a taxi as he is still unwilling to forgive them. Lauren tries to run after the taxi, but Max ignores her. Bobby pleads guilty in court and is sentenced to three years for killing Lucy, and one year for GBH upon Jane, to be served concurrently. He is then sent to a young offenders institute to serve his sentence. Upon hearing Ian saying he should have done more for Bobby when he found out the truth, Keeble asks Ian when he found out. He admits that it was on his wedding night, and Keeble opts not to charge him for perverting the course of justice, feeling that everyone has made mistakes in the murder investigation and that Ian has suffered enough. Bobby feels confident he can be released when Ritchie informs him of potential to appeal, but following Jane's wishes, Ian convinces Bobby to avoid doing so, saying that he needs to accept what he did and carry out his punishment like he deserves. Shortly afterwards, Ian receives a threatening note from Max ‚Äì saying that he will never forget what Ian did. On Christmas Day 2016, Max returns to Albert Square and makes amends with his family; he also apparently forgive Phil and the Beales as well for what they did to him. In 2017, however, it slowly becomes clear that Max is seeking revenge against the square for his wrongful imprisonment ‚Äì with Phil and Ian being his particular targets for causing his conviction. Max's vengeful plot sees him perpetuate the events of his brother Jack (Scott Maslen) losing custody of his stepson Matthew Mitchell Cotton to the latter's father, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett); and blackmailing Steven before causing his death whilst attempting to kill Jane, whom Max then coerces into leaving the square. It soon transpires that Max is working in cahoots with James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), a corrupt businessman who previously raped Kathy back in 1988 and the CEO of the square's business company known as \\"Weyland & Co\\" - initially named \\"Grafton Hill\\". During the course of Max's revenge, he has been conspiring with Willmott-Brown in his scheme called \\"Project Dagmar\\" - wherein Weyland & Co would redevelop the square by overtaking many properties before later demolishing them for the purpose of building luxurious flats; this is revealed to be part of Willmott-Brown's own revenge against the square for wronging him in the past as well as attempting to recoup his obsessive crush on Kathy, all the while Max's collaboration was all to exact revenge for being wrongfully imprisoned for Lucy's murder. Following the revelation of their conspiracy, Max helps Willmott-Brown put his scheme into fruition before eventually getting betrayed. As Willmott-Brown finalizes his development in taking over Walford, Max grows distant from his family when they learn about his revenge plot against the community. The aftermath of Max's betrayal quickly sees him spiral out of control, especially when he tries to kill both Ian and Phil when they learn about his plot. By Christmas 2017, Max has lost everyone and decides to commit suicide ‚Äì but stands out at the last second before Lauren and Abi both end up falling off the roof while trying to talk their father out of suicide. Lauren survives the fall, but Abi dies later in hospital ‚Äì though not before her and Steven's child is born prior to her death. Before Abi's death and subsequent funeral, Max partly helps the community regain their lost properties when Willmott-Brown's scheme ultimately fails and he is later hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. =Bobby's redemption= Sixteen months later, Ian receives a letter saying that Bobby will be released in a matter of months, but he believes that Bobby will be better off with Jane, however, Kathy encourages Ian to tell Peter that Bobby is coming home and to be a father to Bobby and bring him back to Walford. Bobby is later released from prison and greeted by Kathy at home, however he suffered an mental illness which led him to experience hallucinations of his deceased sister. He is not welcomed by other residents due to what he and his family did to Max that cause his revenge towards the residents, Steven death & ruined his relationships with his daughters that cause Abi's death and Lauren refused to return to Walford. Max soon realises that Bobby is a scared child and remorseful for his actions, so welcomes him to the community. Bobby meets with Imran (Reda Elazouar), a friend from the Young Offenders Unit, who gifts Bobby a Quran and a prayer mat because he is converting to Islam. Bobby begins working at his father's restaurant, where he befriends Iqra Ahmed (Priya Davdra). After realising that Bobby has converted, she invites him to the Eid Mubarak celebrations at her house. Reception Kevin O'Sullivan described the storyline as a \\"clapped-out whodunit\\" but other critics were more positive. Kerry Barrett from All About Soap praised the start of the storyline, calling it \\"Emotional, heart-wrenching, devastatingly sad and‚Äîat times‚Äîa little bit uncomfortable to watch.\\" Grace Dent argued that the storyline marked the beginning of a \\"golden era\\" for the show, stating that \\"EastEnders does death with grand aplomb\\".

It is the headquarters of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London, one of the livery companies of the City of London. It is one of the largest livery companies (with over 1,600 members in 2012) and ranks 58th in their order of precedence. The building, originally part of the Dominican priory of Black Friars, was called Cobham House prior to its purchase by the society in 1632. The original building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, although a significant extent of the 13th-century buildings remain, including a portion of the walls, now incorporated into the north range of the hall courtyard. A new hall was built on the same site and completed in 1672 to the design of Edward Jerman; an \\"Elaboratory\\" was included at this time for the first-ever large-scale manufacture of drugs. From then until 1922, the society manufactured medicinal and pharmaceutical products at their hall, and sold some of their products from a retail outlet opening onto Water Lane (now Blackfriars Lane). Much of the manufactured drugs were to supply clients of the society which included the navy, the army, the East India Company and the Crown Colonies. A major restoration and (external) building programme was carried out in the 1780s. Although the hall underwent further redevelopment in the 1980s, its appearance has altered little since the late-eighteenth century externally and late- seventeenth century internally. Apothecaries' Hall is the oldest extant livery hall in the City of London, with significant 13th century elements and the first-floor structure and arrangement of the Great Hall, Court Room and Parlour remaining as rebuilt between 1668 and 1670.

It was finished in 1997 and has been performed widely, especially by the British conductor Simon Rattle. It has been described as a symphony, the third movement being its unacknowledged scherzo.  Composition  The title of the composition is the Latin plural form of asylum, which here means both sanctuary and madhouse. It was commissioned by the John Feeney Charitable Trust and was premiered by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Simon Rattle, in Birmingham's Symphony Hall in October 1997. This piece is best known for its third movement, which features techno-like traits. Ad√®s himself narrated the compositional process as follows: Asyla received critical praise and won a Royal Philharmonic Society Music Award in 1997 and the Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition in 2000. It was eventually published by Faber Music in 2000.  Analysis  This composition has four movements and takes 22 to 25 minutes to perform. The movement list is as follows: It is scored for a very large orchestra, which, in addition to the most common instruments, should also include two pianos (a grand piano and an upright piano tuned one quarter tone lower), six percussionists playing a large range of instruments, and a celesta. The piece starts with an untitled movement with cowbells and the flat piano, which is immediately followed by the horns and the high-pitched sound of the strings. The general atmosphere of the movement becomes much more agitated when the rest of the orchestra joins in progressively. The second movement begins abruptly and suddenly changes to a soft melody played by the bass oboe. Then the strings take over with a style which has been classified by some critics as \\"Wagnerian\\". The sound starts to dissipate towards the end of the movement, fading out using the highest and lowest registers simultaneously. The third movement tries to resemble \\"the atmosphere of a massive nightclub with people dancing and taking drugs\\". It has a steady rhythm which has been compared to Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. The music here is much more insistent than in the previous movements and is much more vivid and lively. After reaching a climax echoed by the strings, the fourth movement becomes calmer at the beginning, and suddenly turns violent when a tutti chord initiated by the horns bursts towards the end of the piece. Asyla ends in a quiet but trembling manner.  In popular culture  The third movement is featured in season 4 episode 10 of the Amazon Prime series Mozart in the Jungle.

Early life and education  Konrad Steffen was born on January 2, 1952 in Zurich, Switzerland to Ernst and Maria Steffen, n√©e Kurzinski. His father was a fashion designer and his mother ran an accounting firm. As a child, Steffen aspired to become an actor, but his father insisted he pursue a profession first. Steffen attended ETH Zurich, from which he received his undergraduate degree or Diplom in 1977 and a Doctor of Science degree (Ph.D.) in natural sciences in 1984. In 1986, Steffen went to the United States as a visiting fellow at the Cooperative Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder.Konrad Steffen CV Career Steffen was an associate professor of geography at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1991 to 1997, whereupon he became a full professor there. He served as the director of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at Boulder from 2005Konrad Steffen , CIRES to 2012. He took office as the director of the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research on July 1, 2012. Research Steffen was known for his research into Arctic sea ice and the glaciers of Greenland, and how they are affected by global warming. He often traveled to Greenland to study these glaciers firsthand; for example, when studying Petermann Glacier for three weeks in 2004, Steffen did so from a camp set up 4,000 feet up the flanks of the glacier's ice cap. He also operated a network of 20 weather stations on the Greenland ice sheet, the first of which, Swiss Camp, he established in 1990. He argued that due to this ice sheet melting faster than anticipated, sea levels could rise by about 3 feet by 2100, considerably higher than the IPCC's upper limit of , and that Greenland might lose all its ice in 10,000 years, but Antarctica would take considerably longer, since it is so much bigger. He was a lead author of the \\"Observations: Cryosphere\\" chapter of the IPCC AR5, released in 2013. Steffen's legacy included conducting extensive geoscience research, then translating the value and implications of the scientific data for nonspecialists, including many journalists who then could inform the public and policymakers. He also served on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Awards  In October 2017, Steffen received the Lowell Thomas Award from The Explorers Club, a non-profit group that promotes scientific exploration. The award is presented by the President of the Club on special occasions to groups of outstanding explorers. The Club cited Steffen's research of sea level changes, sensitivity studies of large ice sheets using in situ and modeling results. Personal life and death Steffen had two children with first wife Regula Werner, who died in 2011 from cancer. He later married Bianca Perren. Steffen died on 8 August 2020 in an accident while on a field trip in Greenland. He fell into a crevasse near the Swiss Camp research station and drowned. Prior to deglaciation, such crevasses \\"were unheard of,\\" according to Ryan Neely III, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds.

Originally based in San Francisco, the S.H.F. community moved their headquarters to Fremont, California, over the course of ten years between 1948 and 1958.  Founding  Born in 1850 in Sydney, Australia, Lizzie Armer (full name Elizabeth but always known as ‚ÄúLizzie‚Äù) moved with her family to San Francisco while still a young child. Not much is known of her early childhood, but at some point during her youth Lizzie Armer was adopted into the wealthy home of Mr. and Mrs. Richard Tobin, parents of Richard M. Tobin. Richard Tobin was one of the original founders of Hibernia Savings and Loan, along with his brother Robert Tobin. With the support of the Tobin family, Lizzie developed her interest in charitable work, focusing on families and children in poverty. In 1870s San Francisco existing Sisterhoods already ran orphanages, hospitals and schools for middle class and wealthy young women, but there was a void in charitable work specifically for the aid of families of the working poor. With the support of San Francisco‚Äôs first Archbishop, Joseph Sadoc Alemany, and Father John J. Prendergast, Lizzie Armer moved into a small home near Pine and Jones Streets in 1872 and began the new S.H.F. order.  Day Homes child care  The Day Homes run by the Sisters in the San Francisco Bay Area were early day care centers for the children of working parents. S.H.F. opened its first child care center, Holy Family Day Home, in 1878, and it was one of the only day care centers of its kind in San Francisco at that time. Circa 1885 the Sisters operated three Day Homes in San Francisco, where children of the working poor were given food, kindergarten-level activities, and toys and games. St. Elizabeth‚Äôs Day Home was built by the Sisters in San Jose in 1907, and St. Vincent‚Äôs in Oakland in 1911; by 1918 the SHF Day Homes minded over 1,700 children per day.

Begun in 1946, it is the longest continuous record of economists' expectations. History Joseph Livingston, then the financial editor for The Philadelphia Record, created the survey in 1946. His detailed questionnaire asked approximately 50 economists around the United States to forecast various economic performance metrics for the next six months, year, and two years. Livingston administered the survey semiannually until his death in 1989, making it the longest continuous record of economists' expectations. In 1978, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia digitized Livingston's historical data and made it available to researchers. The bank continued administering the survey after his death. A 1997 paper by Dean Croushure of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia described the history of the survey, argued for its usefulness in testing rational expectations hypotheses through the comparison of forecasts with reality, and explained how the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia was taking over the survey. Variables and data sources The forecasts made by the Livingston Survey of its variables are compared with actual values reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (in its Survey of Current Business), Federal Reserve Board, and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Forecasts are made for the values of all variables six months from now and twelve months from now (i.e., coinciding in time with the next two administrations of the survey). The variables forecast are subdivided into variables reported quarterly, monthly, and daily. For variables reported quarterly, forecasts for the values two quarters from now and four quarters from now are recorded. For variables reported monthly, forecasts for the values six months from now and twelve months from now are recorded. Similarly, for variables reported daily, forecasts are recorded for the value on the last day of the month six months and twelve months from now. In addition: * The June survey includes forecasts for the annual average for the current year and for the next year. * The December survey includes forecasts for the annual average for the current year and for the next two years. Beginning with the survey of June 1990 (and excluding December 1990) two other long-range forecast questions were included in the survey: * The 10-year annual-average rate of consumer price index inflation. * The 10-year annual-average rate of growth in real GDP. The main variables are as follows: * The quarterly variables include various measures of gross domestic product (including real GDP and nominal GDP). * The monthly variables include measures of the consumer price index, housing starts, industrial production, and unemployment. * The daily variables include various interest rate measures and the S&P; 500 index value. Reception =Academic research= There is extensive academic research citing the Livingston Survey, including some devoted to evaluating the accuracy and bias in the forecasts. For instance, a 1983 paper by Dietrich and Joines began with the observation: \\"For more than a decade, researchers have been using the Livingston survey data on inflationary expectations in empirical work.\\" The heyday of use for the Livingston Survey was the late 1970s and early 1980s, because it was the main survey of forecasts that had been around for a sufficiently long time at the time. Around 1990, research on forecast accuracy switched to using the Survey of Professional Forecasters and Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and more recent research has focused on the Consensus Forecasts. =Reception in the press and blogs= Livingston Survey forecasts have been cited by the financial press and blogs many times.

A police officer in a cyberpunk dystopia, Kogami becomes obsessed with murdering Shogo Makishima, a criminal mastermind responsible for the death of one of Kogami's former allies. The character has also appeared in manga and novel adaptations of the series, a prequel manga series, and the films Psycho-Pass: The Movie (2015) and Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case.3 On the Other Side of Love and Hate (2019), which focuses on Kogami's life after the events of the first anime series. He reappears in third television series Psycho-Pass 3 as a supporting character. A novel and manga also explore Kogami's work as an Inspector years before the start of the first television series. Kogami was created by the Production I.G staff. Writer Gen Urobuchi created the character to contrast Akane Tsunemori, Kogami's police supervisor, whose personality and ideology are opposed to Kogami's. He was designed by mangaka Akira Amano, who wanted to give the character a strong sense of individualism despite the contrasting scenario of the series. Kogami is voiced in Japanese by Tomokazu Seki and in English by Robert McCollum. Critical reception of Kogami has been positive due to his interactions with Akane Tsunemori, and his return in the 2015 film was praised after his absence from the second Psycho-Pass anime with the 2019 providing further depth in characterization. Kogami has been well- received by fans, winning the \\"Mister Noitamina\\" award in and placing on multiple occasions in Newtype popularity polls. Appearances =Psycho- Pass= Kogami is introduced as the protagonist of the anime series, Psycho- Pass. Set in a dystopian future, the series focuses on the use of the Sibyl System: psychometric scanners which calculate the likelihood of a person committing a crime. Its results are known as the Crime Coefficient. Kogami is an Enforcer, a police officer who assists and protects the Inspectors sent to investigate crime scenes and to pursue individuals with high Crime Coefficient readings. Enforcers are themselves latent criminals, hired for their high Crime Coefficients, and are monitored by Inspectors who are authorized to kill Enforcers, if necessary. Kogami was originally an Inspector who worked with Mitsuru Sasayama, who was mutilated and killed by Shogo Makishima, his obsession with solving the case leading to his Crime Coefficient rising and his subsequent demotion. With Tsunemori's assistance, Kogami learns that Makishima killed Sasayama. Kogami and Tsunemori arrest Makishima, whose goal is to disable the Sybil System. Makishama escapes and Kogami leaves his team, an illegal act, to give chase and kill the man on his own. The Sibyl System orders Tsunemori to capture Makishima alive and for Kogami to be executed as a runaway criminal. With the help of his mentor, Joji Saiga, Kogami kills Makishima before he is able to commit an act of bio-terrorism. Although Kogami is not seen again by his former comrades for some time, he tells Tsunemori in the After Stories audio drama that he has withdrawn from society to avoid detection. =Psycho-Pass: The Movie= In the 2015 film Psycho-Pass: The Movie, Kogami lives in the Southeast Asia Union, a superstate which has begun to import the Sibyl System technology, using the city known as Shambala Float as its testing ground. Kogami leads a guerilla resistance to the system's implementation. When Tsunemori goes to Shambala Float to confront him, they end up collaborating to uncover the identity of the union's upcoming president. Attacked by mercenaries, they are rescued by Tsunemori's team. Kogami and Ginoza reunite to defeat the mercenaries' leader, Desmond Rutaganda.

In an upcoming theatrical drama, Kogami will be played by Yuki Kubota. The character also appears in Psycho-Pass branded merchandise, including shirts and collars. Creation and design =Development and influences= Sketches of Kogami by Akira Amano According to Psycho-Pass director Naoyoshi Shiotani, Production I.G. staff developed Kogami's character as a stark opposite to his enemy and rival Shogo Makishima, with Akane Tsunemori as the audience surrogate between them. Their first names indicate this opposition: Makishima's is Shogo (the time between midday and sunset), and Kogami's is Shinya (the time between midnight and sunrise). Shiotani described Kogami as a \\"troublesome person\\" (when dealing with Makishima) and said that although he liked Kogami, he would rather have the talkative Makishima as a friend. Writer Gen Urobuchi said that when he created Kogami and Tsunemori, he tried to balance their traits. Writer Tow Ubukata, who supervised the second anime series, called Kogami a \\"wild\\" character, the Japanese characters for his last name referring to his traits of loneliness and strength. The duo was further stated to resemble the lead characters from the Japanese police comedy-drama Bayside Shakedown, Sumire Onda and Shunsaku Aoshima. Kogami's character was designed by manga artist Akira Amano. Amano said that she began with a black-haired man in a suit and, although she was limited in expressing his characteristics with his clothing, she was finally able to include some individuality in each of her characters. She made the main male lead's design distinctive with a simple police uniform. Kogami's personality was initially designed as more aggressive but after several revisions, he became a gentle, calm, taciturn man. Character designer Kyoji Asano emphasized major contrast when illustrating Kogami and Tsunemori: Kogami wields a weapon freely with one hand while Tsunemori wields it with both hands indicating that she is less highly trained. Asano further stated that Kogami was the easiest character to draw due to his tendency to express an angered reaction. Due to him and Tsunemori being the lead characters, Asano felt like he could care about them. The character has been compared with Charles Marlow in Joseph Conrad's 1899 novel, Heart of Darkness. Like Marlow, Kogami's obsessive hunt draws him close to his prey. After Kogami kills Makishima (and abandons his ideals), he decides to leave society and Tsunemori. Since the series was \\"anti-moe\\", the developers avoided having Tsunemori take off her clothes. Instead, Kogami got undressed instead, providing fan service to the female audience. The staff's main idea was Akane finding the renegade Kogami was influenced by the original video animation series Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team and the Western films Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan. Akane's search for Kogami was influenced by these films because the staff believed this scenarios would appeal to both genders; Shiotani also wanted adult viewers to be able to enjoy it. The non-romantic relationship between Akane and Kogami was viewed as appealing by the staff because of the trust they have in each other. The duo was stated to resemble Sumire Onda and Shunsaku Aoshima, the lead characters of the Japanese police comedy-drama Bayside Shakedown. =Voice actors= Shinya Kogami is voiced in Japanese by Tomokazu Seki who was cast by Katsuyuki Motohiro during auditions for the series. Seki had little knowledge about the series's premise. He was also cast for the role of Nobuchika Ginoza, but ended with Kogami. Seki enjoyed the role and anime. He liked the character and believed that he would fit in the second season as a protagonist strong enough to defeat new antagonist Kirito Kamui. However, Kogami only appears in the second series as Akane's hallucination when she thinks about how to deal with Kamui. Kogami was happy with the impact his character had on the inspector. Because production of the 2015 film did not begin until late in the second anime's production, cast members were concerned that Kogami had been killed off-screen and when the film was announced, were relieved by the character's survival after he disappeared in the first series. Shiotani decided to have the foreigners speak English, in contrast with other films in which they typically speak Japanese. Seki and Kana Hanazawa (Akane), were surprised at this proposal since they had multiple English lines in the end. The idea Shiotani wished to explore within the film was what happens when a confined society is expanded into other countries, bringing chaos rather than peace, which would make the audience further question this ideal. In the film, Seki said that Kogami became less brooding than he was in the first series because he is no longer governed by revenge. The reunion of Kogami and Tsunemori was one of Seki's favorite scenes because their deep relationship is demonstrated when they wordlessly share a cigarette. By the time Sinners of the System was released, Seki still appreciated Kogami's handling but felt pressured by the character's popularity with fans. Kogami is voiced in English by Robert McCollum, who said that Psycho-Pass is \\"always a favorite\\" for fans. \\"In terms of good guys, [it is] tough to get much more low-key than Kogami\\", McCollum said, describing the character as calm. Reception =Popularity= Kogami has been well- received by fans and reviewers, and received the \\"Mister Noitamina\\" award in a poll ranking the popularity of characters on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block. He was voted the sixth-best male character in Newtype anime awards. In another poll by the same magazine, Kogami was voted the 24th-most-popular male anime character of the 2010s. Kogami and Tsunemori received two percent of a website poll regarding characters fans hoped would become a couple. His role in Sinners of the System gave him the top place in a 2019 Newtype poll. In a 2019 Anime! Anime! poll, Kogami was tied with Whitebeard from One Piece for eighth place as the character fans wanted to have as their boss. =Critical response= Critical reception of Kogami has been positive. When the series premiered, ACG News compared him with the comic-book character Judge Dredd from the series 2000 AD and said that Western audiences might find the character appealing. Hiroko Yamamura of Japanator wrote that although it was obvious that Kogami would be the series' protagonist, it was interesting to see him \\"at the wrong end of the barrel for the first episode\\". Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku, however, called him a \\"static character\\" who lacked Tsunemori's development across the series. Kyle Mills of DVD Talk found Kogami's \\"enigmatic\\" characterization his favorite because of his interaction with Tsunemori in the second episode and the exploration of his past in multiple episodes. Rebecca Silverman and Jacob Hope Chapman of Anime News Network felt the deep dynamic between Kogami and Tsunemori to be appealing, and enjoyed Kogami's characterization. According to David West of Neo, Kogami \\"is every inch the shonen action hero\\" in the series; he found this so repetitive that he laughed when Kogami was impressed by Tsunemori's growth as a detective, and thought that the character hogged the spotlight in the story. Kyle Mills called Kogami the \\"apparent villain\\" of the series because he leaves his comrades to save society from Makishima and take revenge for Sasayama's death. The fights between Kogami and Makishima were generally well- received; Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network appreciated the weapons use, but found that the \\"armchair psychiatrist evaluations of each other seemed a little forced\\". Thomas Zoth of the Fandom Post found the first battle slightly anticlimactic, but praised the setting and interactions of the two fighters' final duel. Praising Kogami's role in the final episodes, Zoth criticized how close Kogami appears to be related to his nemesis and found their similarities forced. In his review of Psycho-Pass: The Movie, Jacob Chapman enjoyed Kogami's interactions with Tsunemori but criticized the hallucination scene in which he talks with the dead Makishima; Chapman, however, liked the character quoting writer Frantz Fanon. Anticipating the film, IGN writer Miranda Sanchez expected to see interactions between Kogami and Tsunemori which were absent from Psycho-Pass 2. Sanchez called Kogami's role primarily fan service, writing that the developers did not use the duo's bond to its full potential and the final fight is focused on Kogami. Alexandria Hill of Otaku USA praised the first interactions between Kogami and Tsunemori contrasting with the extensive dialogue early in the film. Robert Frazer of UK Anime Network praised Kogami's role in the prequel manga, Psycho-Pass: Inspector Shinya Kogami, due to his interactions with the rest of the cast; Frazer found it more appealing than Tsunemori's role in the anime's sequel. Anime UK News and Rice Digital called Robert McCollum and Kate Oxley the best English actors in the dub. An Anime News Network reviewer enjoyed the 2019 film's deeper characterization of Kogami, who remains haunted by his killing of Makishima; Kogami is \\"the franchise's breakout male lead‚Äîand perhaps the series' most popular character,\\" who might encourage the writers to give him more screen time. The book Law and Justice in Japanese Popular Culture: From Crime Fighting Robots to Duelling Pocket Monsters notes that Kogami is surprised by Tsunemori's thoughts about the Sybil System; although she approves of the status quo, she does not value the system that monitors the series' world.

In 1900, his union became part of the National Amalgamated Enginemen, Cranemen, Hammer, Steam and Electric Tram Drivers and Boiler Firemen, and he served as a district secretary. He became increasingly prominent in the union through his effective negotiating skills, and in 1901 he worked with the union's secretary, G. H. Copley, to resolve a regional dispute over wages just before strike action was taken. He was asked to become the union's full-time regional agent in 1902, but turned the post down as he wished to remain in his trade, but when he was again offered the post in 1907, he accepted it, as he had become concerned that his prominence in union matters might reduce his work opportunities. He served as the union's agent for the English Midlands and South Wales until 1922. Parker was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Hanley division of Stoke-on-Trent at the 1922 general election, defeating the sitting Coalition MP James Andrew Seddon.

Biography Juan Darth√©s was born as Juan Rafael Pac√≠fico Dabul in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, on October 28, 1964. He is the son of the actress Leyla Dartel (pseudonym of Leyla Dabul) and the tango singer Oscar Fuentes (pseudonym of Juan Pac√≠fico) (1930‚Äì2014). He started his acting career in the eighties. His initial telenovelas were produced by Channel 9. He moved to Channel 13 in 1998, to work in Gasoleros, which made him famous. He has also worked in the teen drama Patito Feo. As Dulce Amor proved to be a huge success Telefe hired most of the cast for a new telenovela, Camino al amor, whose designated couples were composed by the same actors, such as Darth√©s and Sol Estevan√©z. Los ricos no piden permiso featured a love triangle between the characters of Darth√©s, Araceli Gonz√°lez and Luciano Castro. He also started a career as a Tango music singer in later years. =Sexual misconduct allegations= Some Several women, that have worked close with the actor, have publicly accused Juan Darth√©s of sexual misconduct. The first one of them was Calu Rivero, who accused him of sexual harassment during the filming of Dulce amor. Darth√©s in turn filed a suit against Rivero, accusing her of defamation, although Darth√©s then failed show up to the first court hearing in December 2018. Rivero's accusations were followed by the actresses Natalia Juncos and Ana Coacci, who denounced similar actions during the filming of Gasoleros back in 1999. Darth√©s also accused them of defamation. In December 2018, the actress Thelma Fardin, who was also part of the cast of Patito Feo, accused that Darth√©s raped her when he was 45 and she was 16. The event would have taken place in a hotel in Nicaragua, when the cast was making an international tour for the Patito Feo CD. She announced it during a press conference, joined by a statement signed by several Argentine actresses. Darth√©s denies all of these sexual misconduct accusations.

It was built in the early 19th century, possibly 1848, and the existing building is supposedly on the site of an old widow‚Äôs cottage. Known locally as \\"Bun House\\", the pub has been host to a Good Friday tradition of storing hot cross buns in a net hanging over the bar. The Widow's Buns Every year on Good Friday, the tradition of the Widow‚Äôs Buns is celebrated. The legend is that the old widow's only son left to go to sea, possibly during the Napoleonic Wars, and wrote to her explaining that he would be returning home at Easter and to have a nice hot cross bun waiting for him. He never returned, but his mother continued to keep a fresh hot cross bun every Good Friday for the rest of her life. After her death, a huge collection of hot cross buns was discovered in a net hanging from the ceiling of her cottage. More considered accounts take the view that the specific story of the widow and her son is unlikely to be true, as the underlying custom of a belief in the special properties of buns baked on Good Friday was widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries. From at least as early as the mid-18th century, \\"Good Friday bread\\" was thought to have medicinal or curative properties, and hardened over the months or years, could be grated into food to help digestive or bowel problems. In 1848, the public house that was built upon the site of her cottage was named in honour of the tradition she had created. It is locally known as the Bun House. The tradition has continued ever since, with a sailor from the Royal Navy placing a new bun in the net hanging above the bar each year. The practice may have been based upon the belief that hot cross buns baked on Good Friday would never decay. For some years the annual bun has been specially baked by Mr Bunn of Mr Bunn‚Äôs Bakery, Chadwell Heath. A fire in the pub in the 1980s burnt many of the old buns in the net, but even their remnants are included in the net as a memento of that fire. In 2013, it was noted by a local newspaper that 93-year-old Patrick Hines, who was born opposite the pub, has visited every Good Friday for nearly 70 years. The pub was closed, it was thought permanently, in 2015-17. The 2016 ceremony was instead carried out at the Queens Head in Limehouse. A comparable tradition of nailing buns to the ceiling on Good Friday exists at the Bell Inn at Horndon- on-the-Hill in Essex. Possible redevelopment In March 2012, Punch Taverns sold the property to Dalco Developments who may close the pub and redevelop the site. In May 2013, planning permission for the \\"development of a second floor 5x bedroom flat above existing Grade II* Listed Widows Son Public House; alterations to the existing building; and development of new three storey 2 x 4 bed houses in adjacent Public House beer garden\\" was refused. In 2016, new plans were submitted ‚Äì not to redevelop the pub itself, but to erect terraced houses in the space presently used as the pub car-park and beer garden. The pub was closed for a year and reopened early in 2017.

The game was developed by Dinamic Software and designed to be published for the Atari ST, but this version was not released due to Dinamic's Software bankruptcy (1992). The game was later ported for the PC MS-DOS based computers and published in 1995 by Dinamic Multimedia (founded by a part of Dinamic Software owners). The Atari ST version was finally developed by Luis Mariano Garcia (an ex member of Dinamic Software and later, Dinamic Multimedia). An Amiga conversion of the Atari ST version was released in February 2017 by Meynaf. Story After being successful on his previous missions in Army Moves and Navy Moves, Derdhal must now travel to the Arctic and infiltrate a base held by aliens who want to use future human technology for their causes. A U-92 submarine takes Derdhal outside the arctic base and he must use his weapons and skills to finally find out what is going on. The game follows the issues of the previous ones, especially in difficulty levels. Gameplay The game is split into two parts. At the first part (Mission 1) you start on the frozen surface of the Arctic, where you infiltrate the enemy base to destroy the communications system and destroy all their vehicles; get the job done and obtain the code for the second part (Mission 2). After ending the first part you'll get a code, useful to unlock the second mission (a typical scenario for Dinamic Software games). In the first part, you'll fight with hordes of various enemies varying from arctic commandos to air troops, who will shoot or throw grenades instantly. There are several mounted machine guns scattered around the areas. Apart from shooting, the game offers a lot of platform game style action, in which you have to jump to higher grounds in order to reach certain spots and objects. Not only you have to defend your precious energy bar, you have also to watch the limited time offered before ending your mission. Hopefully, there are scattered energy bonuses (depicted as hearts) and extra time bonuses (depicted as clocks) for you to collect. The second part is a bit different. Still an action-adventure game, but now running inside the alien spaceship! Your mission now is to connect the 7 main systems of the spaceship. In there, terror is all over the place while walking in the dark corridors. Robots and deadly alien species will come on you to terminate your quest! There are a few huge beasts called CAPITOSAURUS, some of them throwing acid balls, which will only be killed by grenades.

John Munro was a member of the assize at the Tollbooth of Inverness on 4 June 1616 when John Gordon, 14th Earl of Sutherland was served heir to his father. In 1617 John Munro was amongst those chosen to help settle a dispute between the same Earl of Sutherland and Donald Mackay, 1st Lord Reay over the boundaries of their estates.Mackenzie. pp. 486 In May 1639 John Munro, 2nd of Lemlair commanded a division of the 4000 strong Covenanter army. They went to Morayshire with the intention of opposing the advance of the Royalists to the North Highlands. They encamped at Speyside to keep the Clan Gordon and their allies from entering into Moray, remaining there until pacification was signed on 20 June. Soon afterwards John Munro of Lemlair, following the example of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose severed his connection with the Covenanters and joined the Royalists. On 22 February 1649, John Munro of Lemlair along with Hugh Fraser, Thomas Mackenzie of Pluscardine and Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty led a royalist rising in connection with plans for the Marquess of Montrose to reattempt to recover the kingdom. Now known as the Siege of Inverness (1649) they entered the town of Inverness, expelled the troops from the garrison and demolished the walls and fortifications.Mackenzie. pp. 486 - 487. A Council of War was held on 26 February in which Munro was one of the members.Mackenzie. pp. 487. Upon the approach of General David Leslie, Lord Newark, the Royalists retreated back into Ross-shire. Leslie managed to negotiate peaceful terms with Munro, Fraser and Urquhart but not with Mackenzie. In 1650 Munro rejoined the Covenanter army under Colonel Strachan which was assembled at Tain.Mackenzie. pp. 487 - 490. Meanwhile, the Royalist army under Montrose who had recently landed in Caithness were encamped at Culrain. Colonel Strachan sent out a party of scouts under Captain Andrew Munro, son of Colonel John Munro of Lemlair. The Munros soon reported back that Montrose had sent out a body of horse to ascertain Strachan's movements. In order to deceive this body one troop of horse was ordered out and these being the only Covenanter forces observed, the enemy reported back to Montrose thus throwing him completely off his guard into thinking that the strength of his opponents consisted of a single troop of horse and he therefore made no special arrangements to defend himself. Strachan in the meantime had formed his men into four divisions with the fourth one including the Munros and Rosses under the command of Colonel Munro and Ross of Balnagowan. In the ensuing Battle of Carbisdale the Royalists under Montrose were completely defeated.Fraser. p. 26.

A total of 23 unions belonging to different trades in the film and television industry are affiliated to the FEFSI that has around 25,000 members. Strikes =June 1997= In June 1997, some members of the FEFSI resorted to a flash strike during the shooting of the film Raman Abdullah, directed by Balu Mahendra, protesting against the director engaging \\"outsiders\\". This led into a major crisis when FEFSI launched an indefinite strike, affecting other film units as well. The state government intervened and FEFSI called off the strike after a week. However, the producers hardened their stand and insisted that they would not engage any technician or worker associated with FEFSI. They complained that the rising wages of technical staff and artistes were contributing towards the box office run of Tamil films in 1997. They demanded that workers and technicians form new organisations exclusively for the production of Tamil films, on the lines of organisations in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. The issue escalated when the organisation's leader Vijayan declined to budge from his demands and was unable to gather support from a series of prominent actors and film director Bharathiraja. Vijayan also became the key person for the strike which led to suicide of some members and some lost their assets due to this strike. Films delayed included Marudhanayagam, Jeans, Sethu and Kadhal Rojave. Producer K. T. Kunjumon said his losses amounted to 3 lakhs after a large set he had erected for his film Ratchagan (a replica of the massive Rajaji Hall) was destroyed in the rain. Several new Cielo cars parked near the set were also damaged, resulting in a loss of another 7 lakhs, he claimed. The strike lasted for over six months, delaying the production of several films before easing. In June 1998, FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Association (TFPA) merged and formed a new organisation called the Tamil Nadu Film Producers and Employees Federation. An agreement to this effect was signed by the representatives of the two organisations in the presence of then Chief Minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi. =June 2011= Talks between FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) over wages and working hours became a heated matter in early 2011 and FEFSI members wanted the issue regarding increase in salary to be sorted out immediately, calling for a strike in June 2011. =February 2012= An unofficial two-week strike was held in early February 2012, with nearly 5000 members of FEFSI engaging on a day-long hunger strike at Isai Kalaignargal Sangam in Vadapalani, demanding that the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) implement the revised wages for its members. The strike was made official briefly in April 2012 but did not disrupt any big- budget film productions, and soon the problems were eased out after the intervention of the State's Labour Minister S. T. Chellapandian. =June 2013= A clash broke out when the drivers' union learnt that one of the camera crews supposedly hired a private agency for their logistics, instead of approaching the assigned drivers and this was contrary to union expectations. After brief disturbances in May 2013, FEFSI announced a decision to boycott all vehicles of the drivers‚Äô union. In June 2013, FEFSI announced that they would go an indefinite strike after it was alleged that members of the drivers union had assaulted members of the technicians union at Nerkundram Paadhai on Monday, when they were loading food into an autorickshaw for a film shoot. Two days later the strike was cancelled and film shootings resumed. As a fallout of the strike, the Tamil Nadu Chinna Thirai Producers Council president Raadhika announced that the council had decided to break away from FEFSI. Leaders *May 2009 - Writer V. C. Guhunathan was elected and pledged to improve conditions and work closely with producers. He quit in 2011 shortly after the 2011 State elections results were released and departed from his post simultaneously with Rama Narayanan who left the TFPC. *May 2011 - M. A. Ramadurai stepped into replace Guhunathan following his departure, with G.

From New Jersey, he joined his uncle in Mississippi business. He became a major philanthropist in the South, contributing to educational institutions in Mississippi, as well as the American Colonization Society and Mississippi Colonization Society, of which he was a founding member. Known as \\"King David,\\" Hunt made a fortune in cotton production and sales. He was one of twelve millionaires residing near Natchez, Mississippi at a time when there were 35 millionaires in the entire United States.

Kane, Natchez on the Mississippi, New York: William Morrow & Company, 1947, p. 174-189 In addition to the twenty-one plantations listed below, Hunt also owned the following four plantations: Fatherland, Fairview, Oak Burn and Givin Place. * His Jefferson County plantations were: Calviton, Woodlawn, Huntley, Waverly, Fatlands, Southside, Brick Quarters, Ashland, Black Creek, Oakwood, Buena Vista, and Servis Island. Zachary Taylor bought the approximately 2,000-acre Buena Vista Plantation (also known as Cypress Grove Plantation), which bordered Ashland Plantation and was formed on the land of David Hunt and others. It was located about ten miles south of Rodney along the Mississippi River. President Taylor and his son Richard \\"Dick\\" Taylor - later a Confederate General - visited Hunt's residence on Woodlawn Plantation. * His Adams County plantations were: Lansdowne, located three miles north of Natchez (on what is now highway 555);Official website: History Homewood, which adjoined Lansdowne; and Oakley Grove, located nine miles northeast of Natchez. * His Issaquena County plantations were: Wilderness Plantation, located on the Mississippi River near Mayerville; and Georgiana Plantation, located on Deer Creek south of Rolling Fork. David's son George Hunt owned 400 acres on the Mississippi River in Issaquena County close to Tallulah. Map of Mississippi River (1866) Showing Hole-in-the-wall Plantation * His Louisiana plantations were: Arcola, located just south of the town of Waterproof, Louisiana in Tensas Parish; the adjoining plantations of Argyle and Belle Ella, located to the west of Waterproof, also in Tensas Parish; and Hole in the Wall, located on the Mississippi River on Maxwell Road in northern Concordia Parish, Louisiana Shortly before the American Civil War, Hunt and his adult children owned a total of some 1,700 slaves and controlled tens of thousands of acres of land. Cyrus Bellus and Peter Brown were two of David Hunt's slaves whose interviews are included in the WPA Slave Narrative Collection for the state of Arkansas.Work Projects Administration, Slave Narratives: Interviews with Former Slaves Arkansas Narratives, Part 1, Keith W. Brooks Publishing, 2013, pp 94-97 and 211-213 Peter Brown told of a time when he was a slave on David Hunt's Woodlawn Plantation and Dr. Coleman of Wyolah Plantation came to care for his parents, who had contracted cholera. As a result of his extensive holdings and cotton production, Hunt became one of the wealthiest cotton planters in the Antebellum South. Additionally, he owned business concerns in Cincinnati, Ohio and Lexington, Kentucky. At his financial peak in about 1850, Hunt was worth about $2,000,000.D. Clayton James, Antebellum Natchez, New Orleans: Louisiana State University Press, 1968, p. 158 =Philanthropy= Hunt was among the largest financial supporters of Oakland College in Lorman, Mississippi, which was founded in affiliation with the Presbyterian Church.Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Mississippi, Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican Publishing, 1999, Part 1, p. 310 Over the years he gave a total of about $175,000 to the college. He was a trustee of the College for years. His sons, Abijah, George, Andrew and Dunbar, all graduated from Oakland College. Oakland had to close during the war, as its students went off to war. Some of the facility was damaged during the war, and it never successfully resumed operations after the war. In 1870 the college was sold to the state of Mississippi. The state legislature used this facility to establish the first land grant institution for African Americans in American history, named Alcorn A&M; College and now called Alcorn University, a historically black college. The Presbyterian Church used the money from the sale to found Chamberlain-Hunt Academy in nearby Port Gibson in 1879. C.H.A. transitioned to the military routine in 1915 and was a military college preparatory school until 1971, when girls were admitted and the military discipline was greatly relaxed. Many of David Hunt's descendants or relatives attended Chamberlain-Hunt over the years and until quite recently. The old school did not open in August 2014 and the future is uncertain. The legacy of Oakland College was named to honor Presbyterian minister Reverend Jeremiah Chamberlain (1794-1851), the founding president of Oakland College, and David Hunt, who had been Oakland's most generous benefactor.Goodspeed Brothers, Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Mississippi, Embracing an Authentic and Comprehensive Account of the Chief Events in the History of the State and a Record of the Lives of Many of the Most Worthy and Illustrious Families and Individuals, Chicago: Goodspeed Publishing Company, 1891, p. 310 Mary Carol Miller, Must See Mississippi: 50 Favorite Places, Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2007, p. 135 Samuel J.

He donated the land upon which the church was built and contributed to the building of the church as well. All of his children were baptized there. When the church decided to rent the pews to the church members to raise money, Hunt paid to rent them all to ensure that the poor could attend. He paid a large portion of the pastor's salary, gave the pastor the use of one of his slaves, and often gave the pastor beef and mutton from his plantations. Hunt also gave beef to the poor families of Rodney each Christmas. As a member of the Mississippi Colonization Society and its parent organization the American Colonization Society, he donated to establish a colony for free African Americans in Liberia.David G. Sansing, Sim C. Callon and Carolyn Vance Smith The Annual Report of the American Colonization Society, Volumes 33-46, Washington: C.

One of Hunt's eccentricities was to write checks for one penny less than an even dollar amount. He also gave a small amount to the Fayette Female Academy in Fayette, Mississippi. =Personal life= Hunt resided on Woodlawn Plantation in Jefferson County, Mississippi, which was seven miles south of Rodney, Mississippi and approximately 25 miles northeast of Natchez. He was one of the twelve millionaires living near Natchez in the antebellum era, when there were only thirty-five millionaires living in the entire United States. He was nicknamed \\"King David.\\" Hunt spent many summers in and around Lexington, Kentucky. He travelled by carriage along with a baggage wagon and saddle horses. The trip from Mississippi took one month. He was related to John Wesley Hunt, who lived in the Hunt-Morgan House in Lexington.

The church was founded in 1956 as Westerly Road Church at the intersection of Westerly and Wilson Roads. In 2013, it constructed a new facility and relocated to 1025 Bunn Drive and changed its name to Stone Hill Church of Princeton. The Rev. Dr. Matthew P. Ristuccia, a member of the Princeton University class of 1975, has served as senior pastor since 1985. History =Founding= Westerly Road Church Westerly Road Church was founded at the initiative of two sisters, Helen and Dorothy Harris, with the support of their brother W. Butler Harris, on land along Westerly Road which they donated to the church. The Harris siblings were the children of noted Princeton Professor Walter Butler Harris, and grandchildren of the Rev. William Harris, a treasurer of Princeton University. The Harris siblings, along with many of the early members of Westerly Road, including Elmer Engstrom, were previously communicants of First Presbyterian Church but were dissatisfied with its theological direction under the Rev. Dr. John R. Bodo. Their intention was to have a church where Biblical teaching and missionary activity were emphasized. The original structure cost $30,000, raised by the 22 charter members, and was bought pre-fabricated from U.S. Steel Homes Inc. The sanctuary arrived via train at the Princeton Junction Train Station and was trucked to the site at Westerly and Wilson Roads on the border of the former Princeton Borough and Princeton Township. At the time of construction, the roads were not yet put through and there was no opposition to the church's request for a zoning variance to allow for a religious use in a residential zone. The Harris siblings arranged to call the Rev. Edward H. Morgan of Roanoke, VA, their cousin, as the first pastor, a position which he would hold until his retirement in 1980. The parsonage was built at 25 Westerly Road, which would later serve as the church offices until the relocation to 1025 Bunn Drive. The first services were held on November 25, 1956 with 100 in attendance at the morning service and 30 at the evening. =The Morgan and Bawden Pastorates= The Rev. Ed Morgan, founding pastor of Westerly Road Church. The Rev. Morgan was educated at Hotchkiss, a member of the Princeton University class of 1938, and a 1942 graduate of the Princeton Theological Seminary. He was a member of one of Princeton's oldest families of ministers, including a great-uncle, William Henry Green, who spent fifty years as a professor of Princeton Seminary. The Rev. Morgan had already been serving as the pastor of a Presbyterian church in Philadelphia when he experienced what he described as his true conversion to the Christian faith, a conversion which ultimately led to him accepting the call to be founding pastor of Westerly Road. The number of children in the congregation grew rapidly, with the Sunday school including 85 children within two years of the congregation's founding. This led to the addition of seven classrooms and an assembly hall in the spring of 1959, and another ten room addition in time for the church's tenth anniversary in 1966. The young congregation was one of the first in Princeton to offer Vacation Bible School with attendance nearing 100 children by the summer of 1962. The church was also an early supporter of dedicated youth ministry, including supporting a Princeton chapter of Young Life when it faced opposition from other area clergy. In 1964, Ed Morgan said of Young Life that, \\"They reach a lot of teenagers who go to no church at all or who are indifferent church members. They present, in a rather unique way, what Christ can do for young people.\\" The church's early commitment to children and youth continues today. During Ed Morgan's long tenure as pastor the theme verse for the congregation, affixed to the sign, was Colossians 1:18, \\"That in All Things Christ Might Have the Preeminence.\\"(KJV) Pastor Morgan said of the church on his retirement that, \\"We believe in fundamentals, an adherence to what we believe the Word of God teaches about itself and the Lord.\\" At the founding of the church it was the intention of the Harris siblings that the congregation have a strong commitment to missions. By the time that the Rev. Morgan retired in 1980, the congregation was giving 50% of all general fund contributions to mission work, including providing partial support for 28 missionary families. Most of those families were made up of those who had grown up in the church or entered it as students at the university. Pastor Morgan helped to initiate and encourage the longstanding connection of the congregation to Princeton University by speaking on campus in conjunction with the Princeton Christian Fellowship. This connection to PCF and the campus brought the future theologian John Frame into the congregation. He said of his time at Princeton as a member of the class of 1960 that, \\"Through [the PCF's] ministry (and that of Westerly Road Church) I grew spiritually as at no other time in my life.\\" The church's association with the PCF has lasted its entire existence and the current senior pastor, Matt Ristuccia, served for seven years with the PCF prior to accepting the call to serve at Westerly. By the mid-70s the church had grown to 250 members and a plan was proposed to build a larger sanctuary. However, the Princeton Township Zoning Board denied the necessary variance for parking, leading the congregation to instead plant a daughter church, Windsor Chapel, in 1976 with Rev. Morgan's son called as pastor. The Rev. Morgan retired in 1980 and was succeeded by the Rev. Paul Bawden, who served in that position until 1985. =The Ristuccia Pastorate= Matt Ristuccia. In 1985 the Rev. Dr. Matthew P. Ristuccia was called as senior pastor, a position he still holds. Educated at Phillips Academy and Princeton, he received a degree in Master of Divinity from Grace Theological Seminary and his doctor of ministry from Dallas Theological Seminary. The Rev. Ristuccia first joined the church after experiencing an evangelical conversion during his time as an undergraduate at the nearby university. On his 25th anniversary as senior pastor he said of his initial introduction to the church that, ‚ÄúAt Westerly Road Church, the people who were there wanted to be there. The sermon was really relevant and involved understanding the Bible as a text, much like English lit.‚Äù Pastor Ristuccia also met his wife, Karen, during his time as an undergraduate, their romance as students providing fodder for a piece in a local newspaper in later years. Karen now serves as the Academic Dean of the Wilberforce School, providing direction to its mission to provide a distinctly Christian education within a classical framework. Under the Rev. Ristuccia's leadership, the church has experienced significant growth and started a number of new initiatives. In the 1980s the Learning Center was founded to supplement the education of homeschooled students with classes led by experienced teachers. The relationship with the university continued to flourish, marked by the presence of faculty members such as Dr. James Rankin of the German Department, who started his service as church pianist in the early 1990s. Dr. Rankin described the church to the campus newspaper as marked by prayer, study of scripture, and music, saying \\"A community of believers is something that I want to be a part of, just like in the New Testament.\\" Many students attend the church from the University, the Seminary, Westminster Choir College, and the College of New Jersey. The congregation partners with ministries including the Princeton Christian Fellowship, Princeton Faith and Action, and Manna Christian Fellowship. Relocation Rush Holt speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony for Stone Hill Church of Princeton. Letter from Congressman Rush Holt to Stone Hill Church of Princeton on the occasion of their dedication. The congregation remained on Westerly Road for 57 years but by the mid 1990s the church was housing a congregation of 500 in a building designed for 125 and sought to add a two-story addition to the property on Westerly Road. Under the existing zoning, the proposed 23,000 square foot final structure was permitted. In response to the church's proposal the Princeton Township Committee passed a zoning amendment that would severely restrict the ability of the church to expand on its current property. The zoning change limited churches in residential zones in Princeton Township to a Floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.125 instead of the previous 0.20. This meant a requirement that the total square footage of the building equal no more than 12.5% of the lot, essentially preventing any addition to the existing structure. This zoning limitation was more restrictive than that applied to The Hun School, Princeton Day School, and Stuart Country Day School, as well as neighboring homes. In 2004, the church attempted to relocate to a site on Princeton Pike in Lawrence Township but the requested zoning variance was denied. In 2010, a piece of property became available at 1025 Bunn Drive in the northeast section of Princeton, with zoning appropriate for a church. After a lengthy process of approvals, marked by some vocal opposition, the congregation gained the requisite permissions to build and relocate. A new LEED certified facility of nearly 50,000 square feet was opened in December 2013. The church granted a permanent conservation easement over the wetlands on the southern third of the site, allowing for trail access to the Herrontown Woods Arboretum from Bunn Drive. With the departure from Westerly Road, a name change was deemed appropriate, and the church elders unanimously agreed upon Stone Hill Church of Princeton. The Stone Hill is a reference to the Rocky Hill Ridge on which the new building is located and the significant amount of stone that needed to be removed to allow for the foundation. The original building was demolished to allow for subdivision into residential lots in accordance with the zoning. The new fellowship hall was named in honor of the Harris family, the three siblings who founded the church and donated the original land. The new prayer chapel was named in honor of Westerly and became home to the previous building's communion table and cross. On the occasion of the dedication of Stone Hill Church, Congressman Rush Holt wrote > I regret that I cannot join you in person for today's celebration, but I > want to congratulate the leaders and congregants on this moments occasion in > the history of Westerly Road - and now, Stone Hill - Church.

Her work has been exhibited widely at venues including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, the New Museum in New York and many others. Her work was included in the 2009 exhibition ‚ÄúThe Pictures Generation‚Äù (of which she is considered to be a member) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, alongside the work of her peers and contemporaries, including Cindy Sherman and Robert Longo, with whom she cofounded Hallwalls in Buffalo, New York in 1974, as well as work by Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince, John Baldessari, Louise Lawler and Sherrie Levine, among others. Early life and education Dwyer was born in New York City in 1954. She studied at the State University of New York at New Paltz (1972-1974), the Empire State College ‚ÄúStudio Program‚Äù in New York (1975), and completed her B.F.A. at the State University of New York at Buffalo (1974-1976). She completed a master's degree in Interactive Telecommunications at New York University in 2002. She is currently an Associate Professor of Sculpture at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont. Career Dwyer is considered a core member of what art historians call \\"The Pictures Generation\\", a loose generational grouping of artists who came of age around the mid-1970s. Many of them, like Dwyer, Sherman and Longo, were associated with Hallwalls in Buffalo. Their early work, in particular, is typically characterized by their critical appropriation of images from the mainstream media. Dwyer and her contemporaries approached the image-saturated pop cultural landscape with a sense of suspicion and irony, even black comedy. Dwyer‚Äôs own early series Cardz (1980), for example, was created from an archive the artist had assembled of magazine clippings, advertisements and news stories purporting to depict ‚Äúeveryday life.‚Äù Dwyer distilled from these images a set of twenty-six line drawings that at once defamiliarizes them from their original, often commercial, publishing context and at the same time transforms them into an impersonal catalog of expressive gesture, universal and yet unmistakably the artist‚Äôs own. These line drawings were screen printed onto a set of twenty-six ‚Äúcards‚Äù on laminated leatherette paper, returning the images as objects into circulation, albeit one profoundly transformed. In the mid-1980s Dwyer turned to what she calls ‚Äúword sculptures,‚Äù drawing on her expertise as a one-time commercial sign maker to craft punchy, often darkly comedic pieces that provide Dwyer with a vehicle for her critical take on contemporary American society, mores and messaging. A recent example of this sort of work is BIG EGO II (2010), a huge inflatable sculpture spelling out the word ‚Äúego‚Äù in bloated, vulnerable-looking letters made from bright yellow nylon. An earlier example of this type of work is Dwyer‚Äôs KILLER (1991), which consists of a large, lacquered aluminum table, that seen from above, spells out the title of the piece in a violent-looking sans serif font. Dwyer is also notable for being the only subject in one of Cindy Sherman‚Äôs Untitled Film Stills that is not Sherman herself. The photograph in question is Untitled Film Still #7 (1978): Dwyer is the woman in the sun hat. A line drawing by Dwyer was used for the cover of Hall & Oates' Rock 'n Soul Part 1 (1983). Exhibitions Dwyer‚Äôs first solo exhibition was at Hallwalls in Buffalo, in 1977. In 1980 Dwyer‚Äôs early work was included in the ‚ÄúHallwalls: 5 Years‚Äù exhibition; originally exhibited at the Parsons School of Design, the exhibition then traveled to; the Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston , the University of Colorado Museum in Boulder; the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York and the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago. As well as having her work included in group exhibitions at the New Museum in New York (Fluxattitudes, 1992; Bad Girls 1994), Dwyer‚Äôs work has been exhibited at White Columns (1982), The Drawing Center (1979, 1982), and Artists Space (1976, 1980, 1985) in New York, as well as the Brooklyn Museum (1985), the Birmingham Museum of Art (1985), the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (1987), the Sao Paulo Biennial (1983) and Whitney Biennial (1987). Her work has been shown at the Metro Pictures Gallery (1981, 1985, 1986), among many visual venues. Dwyer‚Äôs work was included in the major exhibition ‚ÄúLaughter Ten Years After,‚Äù which featured pieces by twenty artists, including Sherman, Kruger, the Guerilla Girls, Carrie Mae Weems and Jenny Holzer. The exhibition toured North America for three years (1995-1998). In 2013, the Fisher Landau Center for Art in Long Island City, New York, hosted a major solo retrospective of Dwyer‚Äôs work titled ‚ÄúPainting & Sculpture, 1982-2012.‚Äù New York Times critic Ken Johnson suggested that Dwyer‚Äôs Desk of Envy, a mahogany desk-shaped word sculpture that, when viewed from above spells out ‚Äúenvy‚Äù in large, aggressive letters, be added to ‚Äúa short list of artworks emblematic of the 1980s, including Jeff Koons‚Äôs ‚ÄòRabbit‚Äô and Barbara Kruger‚Äôs montage ‚ÄòI Shop Therefore I Am.‚Äù Critic Robert Pincus-Witten reviewed the exhibition in the pages of Artforum, writing that while ‚ÄúDwyer never became as well known as some of her peers,‚Äù the retrospective of her work at the Fisher Landau center ‚Äúmust be regarded as a vivifying corrective to the unwarranted quiet surrounding works so conspicuous by their wit, craft, and serious import.‚Äù References External links *Nancy Dwyer *Nancy Dwyer at Sandra Gering, New York *Nancy Dwyer at the Fisher Landau Center for Art 1954 births Living people American women artists American contemporary artists ","title":"Nancy Dwyer"},{"id":"42519482","text":"Adrej is a commune in Sefrou Province, F√®s-Mekn√®s, Morocco.

As of the year 2002, Yanase has the rights of exclusive retailer of Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Volvo, Saab, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Smart vehicles to Japanese consumers. It is part of the Itochu group. Yanase currently has 174 stores selling new cars in Japan and 31 stores that sell used cars under direct management. There is a related company or subsidiary organization dealing with a particular brand of imported cars, some in rural areas. On May 25, 2015, the Yanase car dealership network celebrated its 100 anniversary. History REO advertisement sold at Yanase Yanase was established in Hibiya, Tokyo in 1915 initially as a truck and bus builder by Chotar≈ç Yanase, as a part of the Mitsui Group. By 1920 the company became an importer of General Motors products, primarily Buicks and Cadillacs. Yanase was born in Toyooka village (now Takasaki), Usui, Gunma, Japan December 5, 1879 and died July 11, 1956. He was a graduate of the Tokyo Commercial High School, having earlier attended Tokyo Metropolitan High School at Hibiya. After graduation from the Tokyo Commercial High School in 1904, he worked for the Mitsui OSK Shipping Lines when the company was previously known as Osaka Shipping. When Yanase began the importing company with Mitsui, he also imported petroleum mineral oil products. The mineral oil business became Yanase Shoji Co. Ltd. while the importing of automobiles became Yanase Automobile Co. Ltd, where Mr. Yanase served as president. The automobile business was in danger of going bankrupt, until the Great Kant≈ç earthquake of 1923, where his company was instrumental in importing General Motors GMC trucks to help with the disaster recovery efforts, and continued to provide vehicles as the transportation infrastructure was rebuilt.Yanase opened Japan to Western cars, Automotive News, March 31, 2008 Yanase also imported REO Motor Car Company vehicles and chassis. After the war, Yanase resumed importing operations, selling Cadillac, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen under the direction of Yanase's son, Jiro Yanase. Jiro Yanase was born June 28, 1916 and died March 13, 2008. He was inducted into the Japan Automotive Hall of Fame in 2001, and the North American Automotive Hall of Fame in 2004 for his efforts in the Japanese auto industry. He attended Keio High School and graduated from Keio University in 1939, with a degree in Economics, and soon began to work for his father's company, with a position on the Board of Directors in 1941, CEO in 1945, and Chairman in 1985.AGN „É§„Éä„Çª„ÄÅÊ¢ÅÁÄ¨Ê¨°ÈÉé‰ºöÈï∑„Åå„ÄåÁ±≥ÂõΩËá™ÂãïËªäÊÆøÂ†Ç„ÄçÂÖ•„Çä Due to the vehicles being imported, Yanase had a reputation of selling large luxury cars, because European and North American vehicles did not comply with Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement. Therefore, vehicles imported by Yanase were taxed for their larger dimensions. A meeting with the then Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida (1946 to 1947 and from 1948 to 1954) convinced Jiro Yanase that imported cars should be sold as a luxury good, making imported vehicles more expensive than Japanese domestically produced vehicles, thereby allowing Japanese companies to sell their products that were priced lower than imported vehicles. During the economic expansion period starting in the early 1970s, Yanase dealerships progressed across Japan as a retailer of imported vehicles that had a luxury reputation. In 1965, import standards were relaxed to allow the importation of left-hand drive vehicles into Japan, as Japanese vehicles made for Japan are right-hand drive. In 1992 the European and North American companies whose products were imported by Yanase wanted to directly import vehicles to Japan. As of 2000, GM Volkswagen and Audi directly import vehicles but allow their products to be sold at Yanase dealerships. As of 2005, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and BMW reached similar agreements with Yanase. Yanase therefore focuses on its European and American car dealership network, facing new rivals such as Seibu Department Stores.

History and progress The idea was introduced by Brian David Johnson in 2010 who, at the time, was a futurist at Intel working on the challenge his company faced anticipating the market needs for integrated circuits at the end of their 7‚Äì10 years design and production cycle. The roots for Science Fiction Prototyping can be traced back to two papers, the first by Callaghan et-alCallaghan V, Clarke G, Chin J ‚ÄúPervasive Computing and Urban Development: Issues for the individual and Society‚Äù, United Nations World Urban Forum (Habitat) ‚ÄòCities: Crossroads of Cultures, Inclusiveness and Integration?‚Äô within the IRFD Theme: ‚ÄúThe Role of Cities in an Information Age‚Äù on 13-17 September 2004, Barcelona, Spain (later reproduced in V.

The first public Science Fiction Prototyping event was Creative Science 2010Creative Science 2010 (CS'10), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 19 July 2010 (not to be confused with Creation Science), held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 19 July 2010. This event was also significant as it included the Science Fiction Prototype Tales From a PodVictor Callaghan Tales From a Pod, Creative Science 2010 (CS'10), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 19th of July 2010. which became the first Science Fiction Prototype to be commercialised (by Immersive Displays Ltd, ImmersaVUImmersive Displays Ltd, ImmersaVU). In 2011, a second Science Fiction Prototyping workshop was held in Nottingham (UK), Creative Science 2011,Creative Science 2011, Nottingham, UK,, 25‚Äì26 July 2011 in which Intel made the first documentary about this methodology. Shortly afterwards the Creative Science Foundation was formed as an umbrella organisation to manage Science Fiction Prototyping activity, leading to a proliferation of events and publications; a more detailed account is provided on the Science Fiction Prototyping History web pages.Creative Science Foundation History  Methodology  The core methodology is the use of creative arts as a means to introduce innovations into science, engineering, business and socio-political systems. It doesn't aim to forecast the future, rather it focuses on inventing or innovating the future by extrapolating forward trends from research or foresight activities (creating new concepts, schemes, services and products). The main (but not exclusive) methodology is the use of science-fiction stories, grounded in existing practice which are written for the explicit purpose of acting as prototypes for people to explore a wide variety of futures. These 'science fiction prototypes' (SFPs) can be created by scientists, engineers, business or socio-political professionals to stretch their work or, for example, by writers, film/stage directors, school children and members of the public to influence the work of professionals. In this way these stories act as a way of involving the widest section of the population to help set the research agenda. Johnson advocates the following five step process for writing Science Fiction Prototypes: # Pick Your Science and Build Your World # Identify the Scientific Inflection Point # Consider ramifications of the Science on People # Identify the Human Inflection Point # Reflect on what Did We Learn? Full Science Fiction Prototypes are about 6‚Äì12 pages long, with a popular structure being: an introduction, background work, the fictional story (the bulk of the SFP), a short summary and a summary (reflection). Most often science fiction prototypes extrapolate current science forward and, therefore, include a set of references at the end. Such prototypes can take several days to write and for situations where ideas need to be generated faster (e.g. meetings), the concept of micro science fiction prototypes (¬µSFP) is used. Generally, ¬µSFP are the size of a Twitter or Text message, being around 25‚Äì30 words (140‚Äì160 characters in standard English).  Applications  Science fiction prototyping has a number of applications. The most obvious is for product innovation, in which the two earliest examples are Intel's 21st Century Robot (an open innovation project to develop a domestic robot) and Essex University's eDesk (a mixed-reality immersive education desk)Anasol PE√ëA-RIOS et-al \\"Using mixed-reality to develop smart environments\\", Intelligent Environments 2014, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China, 2‚Äì4 July 2014 both of which were introduced in the previous section. Beyond product innovation, science fiction prototyping finds itself being applied to many diverse areas. For example, at the University of Washington (USA) they have used it to facilitate broader contextual and societal thinking about computers, computer security risks, and security defense as part of an optional senior-level course in computer security. In 2014 \\"Drones, smart hydrants considered by experts looking at future of firefighting\\". Colorado Springs Gazette. Retrieved 2017-02-21., these ideas were refined into a SFP methodology called Threatcasting with early adopters including the United States Air Force Academy, the Government of California, and the Army Cyber Institute at West Point Military Academy. An earlier variation called Futurcasting was used by government to provide a tool to influence the direction of society and politics. It did this by using stories about possible futures as a medium to engage the population in conversations about futures they would like to encourage or avoid. Science Fiction Prototyping is also being used in business environments. For example, in Canterbury Christ Church University (UK) Business School it is being used as a vehicle to introduce creative thinking in support of entrepreneurship courses. In the National Taiwan University (Taiwan), it is used to increase business school students' interests in science and technology for business innovation. Elsewhere the Business Schools of the universities of Leeds and Manchester (UK) are exploring its use in community development projects.Future Cities Innovation Workshop Finally, it is being applied to Education. For example, in San-Diego State University (USA) Department of Learning Design and Technology they have explored it as a means for motivating pre-university students to take up STEM studies and careers.Mary de Lepe et-al \\"Using Science Fiction Prototyping to Decrease the Decline of Interest in STEM Topics at the High School Level\\", Transactions of Future Educational Environments (European Alliance for Innovation Endorsed Transactions), Fall 2015. Further afield, in China, they have identified a novel use for the methodology to address the mandatory requirement for all science and engineering students to take a course in English language. In particular Shijiazhuang University (China) are exploring the potential for Science Fiction Prototyping to overcome the dullness that some science students experience in language learning by using it as an integrated platform for teaching Computer English, combining language and science learning.Shumei Zhang \\"Using Science-fiction Prototyping as a Means to Motivate Learning of STEM Topics and Foreign Languages\\", Intelligent Environments 2014, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China, 2‚Äì4 July 2014. China is also concerned to improve the creative and innovation capabilities of their graduate which this approach supports.

Minor. Captain William J. Minor (January 27, 1808 ‚Äì September 18, 1869) was an American planter, slave owner, and banker in the antebellum South. Educated in Philadelphia, he lived at the Concord plantation in Natchez, Mississippi, and served as the second President of the Agricultural Bank. He was the owner of three large sugar plantations in Louisiana and supported the Union during the Civil War for the stability of the sugar trade. Early life Minor was born on January 27, 1808 in Natchez, Mississippi.Louisiana State University Libraries: MINOR (William J. and Family) PAPERS His father was Stephen Minor (1760-1844), a planter and banker, and his mother, Katherine (Lintot) Minor (1770-1844).UNC University Libraries: Collection Title: Minor Family Papers, 1763-1900 Minor was educated in Philadelphia in the 1820s.J.

He also \\"attended lectures in chemistry and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania.\\" Antebellum career Minor owned three sugar cane plantations: the 1,900-acre Waterloo Plantation in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, as well as the 6,000-acre Southdown Plantation and the 1,400-acre Hollywood Plantation in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. However, as an absentee plantation owner, he did not live on those plantations. He hired overseers to make sure the slaves were working on the land. He corresponded via mail with his overseers regularly, sending them precise instructions while living in Natchez himself. Moreover, his sons lived on the plantations part of the time. From 1855 to 1861, his son Stephen lived on the Waterloo Plantation until he joined the Confederate States Army; in 1862, his other son Henry took over. Another son, William, lived at the Southdown Plantation and also managed the Hollywood Plantation. He served as the second President of the Agricultural Bank in Natchez, Mississippi. He was well connected among the planter elite, and visited planters Duncan F. Kenner (1813‚Äì1887) and Henry Doyal as well as the McCollums, the Cages, and the Gibsons.William Kauffman Scarborough, Masters of the Big House: Elite Slaveholders of the Mid- nineteenth-century South, New Orleans, Louisiana: Louisiana State University Press, 2006, p. 23 He read De Bow's Review and kept a diary.LSU Libraries' Special Collections: William J. Minor diary, 1861-1865 Politically, he was a supporter of the Whig Party. He was in favor of tariffs on sugar, which meant more profit for domestic sugar producers like himself. American Civil War During the American Civil War of 1861-1865, he supported the Union and opposed secession, as he believed that would be bad for the sugar industry. However, he was arrested by Union forces with his son Henry in Houma in 1862; they were released a week later in New Orleans. Meanwhile, Unionists stole sugar and molasses from his Hollywood and Southdown plantations, under the false pretext that it had been deserted, even though overseers and servants were there. Minor was on friendly terms with Union Generals Benjamin Butler (1818-1893) and Lorenzo Thomas (1804-1875), whose forces protected Concord (his Adams County, Mississippi, plantation) on September 29, 1863, and on March 10, 1864. Both during and after the war, Minor asked for reparations for the financial losses he had endured due to the theft of commodities by Unionist forces, to no avail. By 1863, he had realized his slaves had become unwilling to work; they also killed hogs and sheep. Because of General Order No. 12 imposed by Union General Nathaniel P. Banks, he was forced to pay them wages. Slaves, who had gotten used to working \\"under the threat of punishment,\\" were not motivated by their salaries; as a result, Minor tried to reduce their wages if they failed to work. By 1865, Minor paid one third of the crop profit at the Waterloo Plantation to his slaves. He signed a work contract with his slaves at the Southdown and Hollywood plantations whereby they agreed to work ten hours every day except for Sundays and received specific hourly wages as a result. Moreover, Minor agreed to clothe, feed and house them all. Minor was a supporter of Abraham Lincoln, whom he called \\"the most conservative & ablest man in the Washington Government.\\" He deplored his assassination, as he believed Lincoln would have been fair to Southern agriculturalists. Equestrianism Minor was interested in horseracing. He corresponded with Cadwallader R. Colden and Sanders D. Bruce (1825-1902) about horses.Yale University Library: Guide to the William J. Minor Horse Racing Papers He served as the Secretary of the Natchez Jockey Club. He visited Jerome Park Racetrack in 1866, while it was under construction. He was also a regular contributor to The Turf, Field and Farm, an equestrian publication. He sometimes used the pseudonym \\"Redlander.\\" Personal life On August 7, 1829, he married Rebecca Ann (Gustine) Minor (1813-1887), the daughter of James Parker Gustine (1781-1818) and Mary Ann (Duncan) Gustine (1790-1863) of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They resided at 'oncord, his family residence, in Natchez, Mississippi. They had seven sons and one daughter, including John Duncan Minor (1831-1869). A Harvard graduate, he married Catherine Surget, the daughter of planter Francis Surget. Death He died of apoplexy on September 18, 1869, at the Southdown Plantation near Houma. He was buried at Concord in Natchez, Mississippi. His obituary was published in The Turf, Field and Farm. It was republished in The Louisiana Democrat. References  External Link  * William J.

The front of the house has a recessed porch supported by box columns, with a vent placed in the gable-end pediment. The front entry is flanked by three-over-one sash windows. The north (right side) elevation has four three-over-one windows that are irregularly spaced, and the south side has two such windows, also irregularly spaced. The rear of the house also has a recessed porch. Exposed rafters decorate the roof line. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, as a well-preserved example of restrained Crafstman style.

Tougias and Casey Sherman.Tougias, Michael J. & Casey Sherman: \\"The Finer Hour: The True Story of the U.S. Coast Guard's Most Daring Sea Rescue\\" The film stars Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Holliday Grainger, John Ortiz, and Eric Bana, and chronicles the historic 1952 United States Coast Guard rescue of the crew of , after the ship split apart during a nor'easter off the New England coast.Barbo and Webster, pp 87-89 The Finest Hours was released in the Disney Digital 3D, RealD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats on January 29, 2016. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and was a box office flop, grossing just $52 million against its $70‚Äì80 million production budget. Plot Bernard \\"Bernie\\" Webber, a crewman at Coast Guard Station Chatham, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, has fallen in love with a local girl, Miriam Pentinen. The two plan to marry on April 16, but in accordance with Coast Guard regulations, Bernie must seek permission from the station's commanding officer, Daniel Cluff, although it is usually just a formality. On the day he is due to ask permission, February 18, 1952, the oil tanker shears in half off the Chatham coast after getting caught in a nor'easter. With the majority of the station's crew already underway with the rescue of the similarly damaged , Bernie is dispatched to pilot motor lifeboat CG 36500 to rescue the crew of Pendleton. Andrew Fitzgerald, Ervin Maske, and Richard P. Livesey volunteer to join Bernie on the rescue mission. Meanwhile, the Pendletons engineer, Ray Sybert, as the surviving senior officer, organizes the surviving seamen to steer the sinking stern of the tanker onto a submerged reef, where it can lodge until rescuers arrive. When Miriam hears that Bernie is leading the rescue effort, she, like a number of townspeople, thinks this is a suicide mission. Few people in Chatham trust Cluff, believing he could not possibly be capable of doing his job because he is not from the area. Miriam drives to the station, demanding that Cluff call Bernie back. Cluff refuses, and brusquely orders Miriam out. Between Chatham Harbor and the open sea lies a bar, a series of shoals that are very dangerous even in good weather. Bernie must time bursts of his engine to ride each approaching wave before it breaks as he pilots CG 36500 across the bar. Although he makes it over the bar, he loses his compass. Bernie steers CG 36500 to the stricken tanker. Although his boat's designated capacity is only 12 people, Bernie manages to rescue 32 crewmen. The stern of Pendleton begins sinking more rapidly during the rescue and goes down shortly after the last crewman comes aboard Bernie's boat. Relying on his knowledge of the coast and prevailing winds in place of his compass, Bernie steers CG 36500 toward home‚Äîa task made more difficult as Chatham loses power. Miriam and the other townspeople drive their cars to the pier and turn on their headlights to guide Bernie in. The end of the film shows photographs from the event that briefly document the aftermath of the rescue. Two months later, Bernie and Miriam marry; they stay together for 58 years until Bernie's death in 2009. Webber and his crew receive the Gold Lifesaving Medal.

That year, the memorial was moved to the grounds of the new courthouse. In the 1990s it was moved back to the town square, and now stands near its original location. All four sides of the monument base have inscriptions. The front, facing south, reads \\"IN MEMORY OF / OUR / CONFEDERATE / HEROES / 1861 - 1865\\". The east side reads \\"LINCOLN COUNTY / REMEMBERS THE / FAITHFULNESS OF / HER SONS AND / COMMENDS THEIR / EXAMPLE TO / FUTURE GENERATIONS.\\" The north side reads \\"ERECTED BY / CAPT. J. MARTIN / MERONEY / CHAPTER NO. 1831 / OF LINCOLN COUNTY / U. D. C.\\" The west side reads \\"OUR FURLED BANNER / WREATHED WITH / GLORY AND THOUGH / CONQUERED, WE ADORE / IT. WEEP FOR THOSE / WHO FELL BEFORE IT. / PARDON THOSE WHO / TRAILED AND TORE IT.\\" The monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.

The party advocated continued membership of the UK in the European Union, with stronger ties and deeper political representation within the European Parliament.  History  United in Europe was founded by Charles Cormack in early January 2014 and registered on 3 April 2014, as a response to the rise of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the influence it was exerting on other political parties. The party believed that UKIP's newfound prominence caused other political parties within the UK to alter their policies and become increasingly Eurosceptic, which the party strongly criticised. The party did not stand in the European Parliament elections and was deregistered in November 2015.  Policies  United in Europe's overriding policy was Britain's continued membership of the EU. The party argued that Britain's future should be at the heart of the EU, as a leader that \\"spearheads European initiatives\\". The party described its general ethos as for British youth, who are not represented by the older established political class, often seen as corrupt and unaccountable. United in Europe described itself as social liberal party, supporting social equality, social justice, the free movement of people and resources, a common market, and reducing barriers and borders. Primarily campaigning in Scotland for the 2014 European elections, the party considered itself a British party with aspirations to become a European-wide movement. Their stance on the Scottish independence referendum was neutral as the party believed that a strong pro-EU voice was vital, whether Scotland became independent or not.

History  The mall's groundbreaking was announced in October 1981, scheduled for November 4 that year. The mall was given a completion date of July 1983, and was to be a 350,000 sq ft center anchored by Belk, J. C. Penney, and Kmart. The first store to open was Kmart, on May 26, 1983.

Penney, and Belk-Simpson for a total of 21 stores, which, plus two soon to open stores, put the mall at 40% occupancy. The mall was foreclosed on in September 1991, after its owners, Blue Ridge Mall Limited Partnership, failed to make payments for two months in a row. After the sale of the mall was delayed several times, it came under the temporary ownership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, until July 1997 when it was sold to the highest bidder. The mall was sold again in 2007, from Hull Storey Retail Group to Hendon Properties, who had intentions to redevelop the property. TJ Maxx opened at the mall on May 20, 2012.

Context \\"On September 11, 2001, 19 militants associated with the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda hijacked four airliners and carried out suicide attacks against targets in the United States. Two of the planes were flown into the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, a third plane hit the Pentagon just outside Washington, D.C., and the fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. The total number of people killed because of these attacks was 2,753. The ratio of men to women killed during the attacks was 3:1. Faludi talks in depth about how mass amounts of volunteers arrived to help the victims rescued for the World Trade Center Towers. However, there were very few victims to help. 21,744 remains were found while only 291 bodies were found \\"intact\\". Synopsis Faludi focuses on analyzing the media, politics, and popular culture to find the answer to why American society tried to restore \\"traditional\\" manhood and gender roles after the 9/11 attacks. She uses mainly anecdotal and qualitative evidence to support her theories. During the first half of the book, Faludi explains how America reacted after the events of 9/11. Faludi argues that the media was guilty of creating myths about \\"John Wayne\\" type of men, particularly New York Firemen, rescuing \\"damsels in distress\\" in the aftermath of the attack. Sexist slogans such as \\"As War Looms, It's OK to Let Boys Be Boys Again\\", were displayed proudly in the media while women were marginalized by the media. Firefighters were renamed firemen in the media and women were not eligible to receive \\"hero status\\". A clear example of how men were the only ones qualified to be heroes can be seen from the events that occurred on Flight 93. The men, such as Todd Beamer, on the plane were hailed as heroes despite no clear evidence of these facts while Sandra Bradshaw, a flight attendant who tried to throw boiling water on the terrorists, was barely mentioned in the media. Feminism talk was denounced as unpatriotic. Government stoked the anti-feminist fire with propaganda about the American military men protecting the American women and going to save the women of Afghanistan from oppression. There was also a significant decrease in the number of sexual discrimination cases prosecuted in federal courts. In the next part of the book, Faludi traces the history of how American culture has always loved myths created of rescuing \\"damsels in distress\\". Faludi talks about Jessica Lynch's story of being a prisoner of war. Lynch was originally portrayed in the media as a tough girl, but the media soon cast her as a \\"damsel in distress\\" who needed saving. Throughout history, a demand for the manly man was needed to convey the image that America could defend itself from any foreign entities. Faludi argues that the 9/11 attacks caused Americans to return to these myths that have been ingrained into our psyche and try to restore traditional gender roles out of fear. Faludi concludes that we need to become an equal society that embraces diversity and individual talents instead of retreating to these false ideologies that do more harm than good to our society. Reception The Terror Dream was met with mixed reviews by critics. In a review published in USA Today, Olivia Barker stated the book was \\"probing and provocative\\".Barker, Olivia (October 4, 2007),\\"Faludi: Myths sprang up in the ashes of terror\\", USA Today, However, Barker criticized Faludi for using secondhand sources and not interviewing sources herself. In addition, Barker criticized Faludi for not giving the media individuals she attacked in her book a chance to explain themselves. Author Carol Anne Douglas stated, \\"Faludi's book certainly makes a point, but it lacked an economic analysis\\".Douglas, Carol Anne (July 1, 2008),\\"From War to Peace\\" A professor at the University of East Anglia, Sarah Churchwell, applauded Faludi's argument. However, Churchwell criticized that Faludi exaggerated and created myths of her own.Sarah Churchwell (March 21, 2008),\\"We're at War, Sweetheart\\", The Guardian, In the review, Churchwell said, \\"Ultimately Faludi is guilty of her own exaggerations and mythmaking, strong-arming her argument into submission - which is a pity, because it was so unnecessary.\\" New York Times journalist, Michiko Kakutani, was highly critical of The Terror Dream. \\"This, sadly, is the sort of tendentious, self important, sloppily reasoned book that gives feminism a bad name.\\" She accused Faludi of using the 9/11 attacks as a platform to restate many of the arguments she made in Backlash. In addition, Kakutani accused Faludi of ignoring evidence that would discredit her theories while providing anecdotal evidence to support them. Kakutani stated, \\"...ill conceived and poorly executed book-a book that stands as one of the more nonsensical volumes yet published about the aftermath of 9/11.\\" Another NY Times journalist, John Leonard, had a much more positive view of Faludi's The Terror Dream. Leonard stated, \\"In The Terror Dream a skeptical Faludi reads everything, second-guesses everybody, watches too much talking-head TV and emerges from the archives and the pulp id like an exorcist and a Penthesilea.\\" References 2007 non-fiction books American non-fiction books Books about politics of the United States Books by Susan Faludi English-language books Feminist books Macmillan Publishers books ","title":"The Terror Dream"},{"id":"42520076","text":"Dobro is a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar.

Habitat Neotrogla are found in dry cave systems throughout Brazil. They feed primarily on bat guano. Description Neotrogla are about the size of fleas. The genus can be distinguished from other genera of Speleketorinae by the presence of articulated spines on the anterior side of their legs, and by their unique genitalia. Both sexes have hairs on their tarsus, but the hairs on females are markedly longer. Neotrogla have branched hindwings and brown forewings. =Sexual reversal= Female Neotrogla possess a penis-like organ, properly termed a \\"gynosome\\", but interchangeably called a penis. They aggressively seek out mates, while males are more selective. During mating, the female mounts the male and penetrates his small genital opening from behind. Her gynosome swells and tiny barbs on the organ lock the individuals tightly together; when a researcher tried to separate mating individuals the male was torn in two, leaving his reproductive organs attached to the female. During mating, the female uses her gynosome to extract sperm and nutrient-filled seminal fluid from the male. A single mating session can last from 40 to 70 hours. The reversal of sex organs may be explained by the lack of nutrients in the cave environment, which makes it evolutionarily useful for the female to extract nutrients from the male. Female Neotrogla drain males of seminal fluid even when they are too young to reproduce, giving weight to this theory, according to entomologist Kazunori Yoshizawa who co-authored the first study of the insects' mating behavior. If males spend most of their limited resources producing such nutrient-rich fluid, it would also help explain why males are choosy about their partners. Males of other insects are known to produce similar \\"nuptial gifts\\" of nutrients to be passed over during mating. However, the evolutionary origin of the penis-like organ remains a complete mystery. \\"Usually, a new structure evolves as a modification of a previously existing structure,\\" Yoshizawa explained. Such an adaptation would be \\"exceptionally difficult\\" because of the need for male and female genital structures to change at the same time. Female penetration of males is known in a few species, such as Seahorse, but only Neotrogla females have a well- defined organ that can be described as a penis. Likewise, reversal of sex roles has been recorded in a few other species of animals. Neotrogla, however, appears to be unique in having both traits. According to Yoshizawa, the animal offers a singular chance to study the conflict between the sexes and the role of sexual selection in evolution. \\"It will be important to unveil why, among many sex-role-reversed animals, only Neotrogla evolved the elaborated female penis,\\" he said. In 2017, Kazunori Yoshizawa, Rodrigo Ferreira, Yoshitaka Kamimura and Charles Lienhard have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in biology \\"for their discovery of a female penis, and a male vagina, in a cave insect\\". Taxonomic history Neotrogla was first spotted by ecologist Rodrigo Ferreira. In 2010, entomologist Charles Lienhard assigned the insects to a new genus, designating Neotrogla brasiliensis as the type species. It was the first New World genus of Sensitibillini, a tribe of Speleketorinae previously known only from Africa. Neotrogla is closely related to the Southern African genus of barklice Afrotrogla.

At its heart are the twin squares of the larger '/' (\\"Large Sablon\\") square in the northwest and the smaller '/' (\\"Small Sablon\\") square and garden in the southeast, divided by the Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon. History Antoon Sallaert's The Infante Isabella shoots the jay of the Grand Serment [Crossbowmen's Guild] with a crossbow in the Sablon in Brussels depicts an Ommegang in 1615. =Early history= The Sablon lies near the Mont des Arts/Kunstberg neighbourhood, and lay not far outside the first walls of Brussels. It was originally an unused open space, with areas of wetlands, grassland and sand, where a hermit made his home. The words sablon in French and zavel in Dutch both mean a fine-grained sand, halfway between silt and sand. Saint John's Hospital (, ) used the area as a cemetery in the 13th century, having run out of space in its own cemetery. In 1304, the Guild of the brothers and sisters of Saint John's Hospital ceded the land to the Crossbowmen's Guild. They built a modest chapel dedicated to Our Lady on the site, completed in 1318, setting off the transformation of the area. Le Sablon. Le quartier et l'√©glise, Ville d'Art et d'Histoire. n¬∞ 9, Editions Solibel & Brussels-Capital Region, 1995, p. 3 Legend has is that the chapel became famous after a local devout woman named Beatrijs Soetkens had a vision in which the Virgin Mary instructed her to steal the miraculous statue of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw op ‚Äòt Stocxken (\\"Our Lady on the little stick\\") in Antwerp, bring it to Brussels, and place it in the chapel of the Crossbowmen's Guild. The woman stole the statue, and through a series of miraculous events, was able to transport it to Brussels by boat in 1348. It was then solemnly placed in the chapel and venerated as the patron of the Guild. The Guild also promised to hold an annual procession, called an Ommegang, in which the statue was carried through Brussels. This Ommegang developed into an important religious and civil event in Brussels' annual calendar. =15th to 18th centuries= The Egmont Palace, now part of the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs In the 15th century, the neighbourhood began to enlarge substantially. The chapel was rebuilt as the larger and more elegant Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon, still standing today. In 1470, Duke Charles the Bold charged a body with the creation of a street running from his nearby Coudenberg Palace to the church. The church became the site of the baptisms of princes; Archduchess Mary of Austria's baptismal cort√®ge went to Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon instead of the Church of St. Michael and St. Gudula, which had previously held the honour. Governor Margaret of Austria made it the site of her religious devotions as well. In 1530, it saw the greatest July procession in its history. These symbols of royal favour would ensure the lasting prosperity of the Sablon area. The Wolweide () area, corresponding loosely to the current /, was an extension of the Sablon, stretching to the slopes of the Galgenberg hill, where the current Palace of Justice stands. The Grand Sablon and its market, In the 16th century, Brussels' most prominent noblemen established themselves on the upper Sablon and on Rue aux Laines. The Egmonts, the Culemborgs, the Brederodes and the Mansfelds were the first, and the De Lannoys, the De Lalaings, the Thurn und Taxis, and the Solres joined them. The result was that by the 17th century, the Sablon had grown to become the most aristocratic and prosperous neighbourhoods in the city. The Egmont Palace on the Petit Sablon is still standing, and gives the best indication of what the area was like at the height of its splendour; the grandiose houses of the Lannoys and the M√©rode-Westerloo family still stand on Rue aux Laines. In 1566 the Culemborg mansion on / was the site of the drafting of the Compromise of Nobles which ultimately led to the Dutch Revolt. To eliminate any trace of this seditious act against the king, the Duke of Alba razed the mansion to the ground in 1568. The proximity of the cemetery was already an irritation to its aristocratic neighbours in 1554, but it would be another century and a half before the government of Brussels recognised that the situation had become unbearable. They reported that corpses \\"were often neglected and left in only half-covered graves, from which dogs had several times pulled parts off and run around in broad daylight with arms and legs in their mouths\\". ¬´ ...estoient souvent n√©glig√©s et mis dans les fosses √† moiti√© couverts, dont les chiens avoient plusieurs fois tir√© des pi√®ces et couru en plein jour avec les bras et les jambes... ¬ª Alexandre Henne and Alphonse Wauters, Histoire de la ville de Bruxelles, √âditions Libro-Sciences, 1968, Tome 3, p. 401 It was therefore decided in 1704 to move the cemetery to the Marolles/Marollen area.

After losing its prestige, the Sablon is chic once again. =19th century to present= The Sablon neighbourhood was remodelled in the 19th century as / was driven through the area, creating a Haussmann-style artery between the Royal Palace of Brussels and the new Palace of Justice. The new street skirted the church: all buildings immediately adjacent to it were demolished starting in 1872, opening up new views of the church. Buildings not directly adjacent to the church were renovated and improved. Le Patrimoine monumental de la Belgique: Bruxelles, Volume 1C, Pentagone N-Z, Pierre Mardaga √©diteur, 1994, p. 274 From the 19th to early 20th centuries, the Grand Sablon became a renowned site for a sport called ', a sort of handball. Though the sport is no longer played much today, it enjoyed immense popularity at the time. The Kings of the Belgians would frequently be seen among the spectators of a match; Leopold II explained that he would frequently come watch the games, as he lived in the area. Jacques Dubreucq, Bruxelles 1000. Une histoire capitale, Edited by the author, 1996, Volume 1, p. 258 The social composition of the neighbourhood changed over the course of time. In the 19th century, it was incrementally abandoned by the aristocracy in favour of newer, more chic neighbourhoods, such as the Leopold Quarter. In the 20th century, the Grand Sablon square was occupied by a more modest populace, characterised by small workshops and warehouses. At the end of the 1960s, the character of the area began to change yet again. Multiple antique stores moved to the area, following demolitions in the nearby Mont des Arts area.

Recently, a number of chocolatiers and confectioners have come to the area., which is once again the heart of the Brussels upper class. Grand Sablon on the Grand Sablon Square =History= The Grand Sablon Square lies to the northwest of the church. It is in the shape of a long triangle, around wide in the southeast, terminating in a point around to the northwest. When Brussels' residents refer to the \\"Sablon\\" without qualification, they are usually referring to the Grand Sablon. Jean d'Osta, Dictionnaire historique et anecdotique des rues de Bruxelles, Le Livre, 1995, p. 293 The Grand Sablon was linked to the Petit Sablon by / and /, though the division between the two Sablons was accentuated by / cutting through the area. In the 16th century, the Grand Sablon was known as the Peerdemerct (Middle Dutch for Horse Market, ), due to the horse market which was held there from 1320 to 1754. The place was also known as the Zavelpoel (\\"Sandy pond\\") Roel Jacobs, Bruxelles, l'histoire de la ville, √âditions Marc van de Wiele, 1994, p. 78 due to a pond in the centre which would last until 1615. After the pond was filled in, a fountain was erected in its place in 1661. Water was brought to the fountain by a new conduit from Obbrussel (now Saint-Gilles). This fountain was replaced in 1754 by the present , which was a posthumous gift from the exiled British nobleman Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury, who wished to thank the people of Brussels for their hospitality. The fountain was renovated in 1999. La fontaine de Minerve coule √† nouveau, Le Soir, 4 December 1999 The Grand Sablon was often the stage for festivals and competitions, but also for tragic events. On 1 June 1568, it was the site of a mass execution, as 18 signatories of the Compromise of Nobles were decapitated. Louis Verniers, Un mill√©naire d'histoire de Bruxelles. Des origines √† 1830, √âditions A. De Boeck, 1965, p. 227 Saint-Verhaegen festivities =Present day= The Grand Sablon is nowadays a genuine neighbourhood with residents and small businesses, while at the same time being a popular place to stroll and a tourist attraction. Surrounding the square are numerous antique stores, fashionable boutiques, hotels, restaurants, an auction house, and numerous pastry shops and well-known Belgian chocolatiers, including Neuhaus, Pierre Marcolini and Godiva. On Saturdays and Sundays, the Grand Sablon hosts the Sablon Antiques and Books Market. As is the case with many other public squares in Brussels, the Grand Sablon has been partially transformed into a parking lot. A plan to refurbish the space is being investigated. Each year, the Sablon is the starting point for the Ommegang of Brussels procession. On 20 November, it hosts the beginning of the Saint-Verhaegen student parade, which celebrates the founding of the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel universities. Petit Sablon Edgmont and Horn in the Petit Sablon's garden To the southeast of the church, and slightly uphill, lies the Petit Sablon Square. It is a roughly rectangular garden, featuring trees, hedges, flowers and most notably, statues. In the Middle Ages, the Zavelbeek (\\"Sablon Brook\\") had its source in the Petit Sablon. It flowed in nearly a straight line into the Senne river, joining it roughly at the current Fontainas Square. Its course is still followed by the streets in the area to this day. Roel jacobs, Bruxelles. L'histoire dans la ville, √©ditions Marc van de Wiele, 1994, p. 70 The Petit Sablon was the site of Saint John Hospital's cemetery, mentioned above, until it was moved. The present-day garden was created by the architect Henri Beyaert, and was inaugurated in 1890. It is surrounded by an ornate wrought iron fence inspired by one which once decorated the Coudenberg Palace. The fence is punctuated by tall stone pillars; atop each pillar is a statue of one or more historical professions, with 48 statues in total. To ensure that the statues were stylistically coherent, Beyaert asked painter Xavier Mellery to design all of the statues. Each pillar has a unique design, as does each section of fence.

The fountain was initially in front of the King's House on the Grand Place, the site of their execution. The fountain is surrounded by a semicircle of ten statues of political figures, intellectuals and artists from the 16th century.

History There has been a church in Meland for a long time. The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to at least the year 1350, but it was likely built before that time. The original church was a stave church. That church stood about to the southwest of the present church site. THa building was in use until 1616 when it was torn down and replaced by a timber- frame church on the same site. In 1731, the church was sold into private ownership by the King. In 1856, the private owners of the church sold it to the municipality. The municipal government thought the church was too small and in need of repairs, so in 1866, a new church was constructed a short distance to the northeast.

He is particularly known for his donations to Republican political and Southern Baptist church causes, the latter through his Cason Foundation, which he established in 2010. Background Cason formerly owned Fairview Trucking and holds at least sixty-eight acres in the heart of the Haynesville Shale, which yields more than $1 million a month for Chesapeake Energy of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He owns Cason Timber and Cattle Company in Coushatta. Cason has previously lived in Alexandria, Pineville, Natchitoches, Provencal, Ruston, Bossier City, Campti, Lecompte, and Haynesville, Louisiana, and Hamburg, Arkansas. Baptist causes The Caskey Divinity School at Baptist-affiliated Louisiana College in Pineville is named for his father-in-law, a pastor from Red River Parish. Cason and his wife, the former Flora Jean Caskey (born July 1955), donated $5.1 million to the divinity school over several years prior to 2013. It was reported that the Cason Foundation was prepared to give upwards of $60 million for the operation of the divinity school, but the Baptist Message, the state denominational newspaper, could not ascertain any public statements on behalf of Edgar Cason stipulating a specific amount that might be forthcoming. Then in a dispute with then LC president, Joe W. Aguillard, they withdrew all future funds to the institution. Cason maintained that Aguillard diverted $60,000, including $2,000 for a pair of suits, from the Caskey Divinity School to an LC missions project in Tanzania, Africa, which Cason had never agreed to underwrite. Cason was particularly disturbed that the LC trustees in March 2013 refused to hear his complaint in the matter. Cason wrote the trustees: \\"We deeply regret that we must now discontinue [our] support [because of] the actions of President Aguillard which we believe to be unethical and potentially illegal. We disapprove of his use of Caskey funds for LC Tanzania and consider this to be misappropriation.\\" A year later, as other controversies mounted, the trustees removed Aguillard as president but allowed him to remain a president emeritus with one year of salary while on leave and the option to return in 2015 as a tenured faculty member in the Graduate School of Education. Aguillard's interim successor was Argile Smith, the former director of the Caskey Divinity School. After the dispute with Louisiana College, the Casons entered into an agreement with New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary to establish the Caskey Center for Church Excellence with an initial gift of $1.5 million from an anonymous donor. The center will offer free theological education for small-church bi-vocational pastors and staff members of Southern Baptist congregations within Louisiana. Republican contributions Cason is a particularly significant donor to his local congressman, Republican John Fleming of Minden in Webster Parish, who has represented Louisiana's 4th congressional district since 2009. Cason donated $5,000 in 2012 to the Louisiana Values Political Action Committee. In 2012, he supported John David Cowart, an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Arkansas' 4th congressional district, who lost his primary bid to Tom Cotton, who left the House after one term to run successfully against Mark Pryor for the U.S. Senate in 2014. Cason first donated in 2012 to the presidential campaign of Governor Rick Perry of Texas but then switched to former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who in turn lost the nomination to Mitt Romney. He also donated to the National Association for Gun Rights, Inc., PAC.

Three people were murdered as human sacrifices to Santa Muerte. Background Silvia Meraz was born in Hermosillo, Sonora. Her family lived in poverty in a poor neighborhood of Nacozari de Garc√≠a Municipality in Sonora. At age 16, she gave birth to her first son, Ram√≥n Omar Palacios Meraz. She had three more children with her first husband, Mart√≠n Barr√≥n L√≥pez: Iv√°n Mart√≠n, Francisca Magdalena and Georgina Guadalupe Barr√≥n Meraz. She had her last daughter at age 29, named Silvia Yahaira, whose last name is not known. At the time of the murders, Silvia was in a relationship with a man 5 years younger than her, Eduardo S√°nchez Urrieta, who had a child from a previous relationship named Mart√≠n R√≠os S√°nchez-Urrieta. Crimes At some point, Meraz became convinced that she could receive economic favors if she offered human sacrifices to Santa Muerte. Motivated by delirious ideas, she orchestrated the murders with the complicity of her family to win Santa Muerte's favor. Meraz gained the following of eight members of her family, including four of her five children: Ram√≥n Omar, Francisca Magdalena, Georgina Guadalupe and Silvia Yahaira, her father Cipriano Meraz, her partner Eduardo S√°nchez and a woman named Zoyla Hada Santacruz Iriqui. =First murder= The first victim was Silvia Meraz's 55-year-old friend, Cleotilde Romero Pacheco, who was found dead in December 2009. Cleotilde Romero was a local woman who sold popsicles. She had no close relatives. Meraz later recounted that she had told Romero to pick up a 20-peso note off the ground, and when Romero bent down to pick it up, she struck her in the neck with an ax. She made an offering of the victim's blood in order to obtain protection on the part of Santa Muerte, and later burned and buried the decapitated corpse near the family home. =Second murder= The second victim was 10-year-old Mart√≠n R√≠os Chaparro o S√°nchez-Urieta, biological son of Eduardo S√°nchez and adopted son of Silvia Meraz. He was murdered in June 2010. Meraz recalled that she had gotten the boy drunk and her youngest daughter‚Äîage 13 at the time‚Äîstabbed him at least 30 times. In a ritual held while he was still alive, his veins were cut and his blood was spread around an altar. =Third murder= The final victim was Jes√∫s Octavio Mart√≠nez Y√°√±ez, another 10-year-old boy. Mart√≠nez was the adopted son of Iv√°n Mart√≠n Barr√≥n Meraz, and therefore Meraz's grandson. He was murdered in July 2010. In this crime, Meraz held the boy in front of the altar while one of her daughters slaughtered him. A statement by prosecutors indicated that three children of the ages of five, two and one years old were involved in some way, in the very least witnessing the murder. According to one of Zoyla Santacruz's daughters, Meraz had threatened to kill them if they did not participate in the crimes. The children were beheaded in rituals. Investigation, arrest, and trial The investigation began after Jes√∫s Mart√≠nez was reported missing by his mother and her boyfriend. Investigators initially thought that the child could have been abducted by a human trafficking network due to alleged witness sightings of the boy near the Arizona border begging in the street. This hypothesis was ruled out. After two years of investigation, the Meraz family was implicated in the crime, as the body of Mart√≠nez was found under the floor of Meraz's youngest daughter's bedroom. The other two bodies were found in an unpopulated area northeast of Nacozari near Meraz's house. The state police discovered the bodies during an unrelated investigation. Silvia Meraz and the other seven involved (all Meraz relatives, including the husband of Silvia Meraz, her son, father of the last victim and a minor) were arrested in March 2012. Meraz received a prison sentence totaling 180 years. The rest of the cult members were sentenced to 60 years in prison, while the youngest daughter was sent to a youth detention center. According to psychological evaluations, the girl‚Äîwho was 15 years old at the time of the murders and participated in the cult from an early age‚Äîappeared to consider such practices as normal.
