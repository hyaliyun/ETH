Its creation took place after the election of the current president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who then set up a National Human Rights Institution. Thereafter, the Commission was set up in order to give people the truth about what happened in the 1990s. However, its report was not made public and consequently, Algerians are not aware of the fate of their relatives. Background Since Algeria's independence in 1962, the army has played an important role in the political life of Algeria: > \\"It was often sardonically remarked by Algerians that while every state has > an army, in Algeria the army had a state.\\" Military forces had fought against French rule for independence before an authoritarian regime was put in place in 1962. It was led by the Front de Lib√©ration Nationale who worked with the army. Until President Houari Boum√©di√®ne's death in 1978, the military forces had been under control. Then, they came to power and chose \\"their\\" man as President, leaving to the FLN the sole task of running the administration\\". In 1979, Chadli Bendjedid was elected president. In 1991, seeing that the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), an Islamic party, was about to win the next election, the army officially took power, leaving no place to political parties and cancelled the future election. President Chadli Bendjedid dissolved the People's National Assembly and resigned. This marked the beginning of the civil war. A temporary government, the High Council of State, was put in place, initially led by Mohamed Boudiaf. But he was assassinated within six months and was succeeded by Ali Kafi. Kafi was in power until the dissolution of the High Council of State and was succeeded by Liamine Z√©roual. During this period, extremist militias such as Groupe Islamique Arm√© rose because they disagreed with the decisions taken about the election. They started to show violence against police, military and civilians, including terrorist attacks. Therefore, a state of emergency was declared. Islamic people began to disappear, to be killed and to be forced to move. Islamic people were chosen randomly. In other words, they could or could not be linked with any militias or act of violence. In 1999, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was close to Boum√©di√®ne, was elected president and ended the war. Islamic groups agreed to lay down their weapons for Algeria to become at peace again. At the end of the conflict, more than 150,000 deaths and 7,000 disappearances were registered.  Purpose of the inquiry commission  In 2003, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika put in place a commission to investigate past crimes. It was called ‚ÄúAd Hoc Inquiry Commission in Charge of the Question of Disappearances\\". It was made up of six commissioners, five men and one woman, all Algerian. They were all chosen by the President. The aim of the commission was truth-seeking, especially to know what happened to the disappeared people. It was also meant to plan and give reparations to the families of the victims. However, it is said that the commission functioned more like \\"a ‚Äòmanagement center' and an interface between families of the disappeared and the Algerian public administration\\" than a commission of investigation.  Results of the commission   Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation  In 2005, the President called a referendum to approve the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation (CPNR). It came out of a previous law enacted in 1999 which \\"promoted peace and national reconciliation\\". With this law, Islamist groups agreed to stop violence, expecting a peaceful state. The charter was approved in the referendum, with 96% in favour. In effect, Algerians accepted amnesty. However, the opposition maintained that the approval was \\"the result of the government's programme of propaganda\\". Therefore, this charter aimed at peacemaking and granting amnesty to murderers and criminals. They all could get through it unscathed, whether they were considered terrorists or not. There were exceptions for crimes like \\"massacres, rapes, and bombings in public places.\\" The word \\"terrorism\\" does not appear in this charter. The past events were qualified as a \\"national tragedy\\", a way for the government not to denounce and condemn their criminals but also to promote peace. The Algerian government has considered reconciliation through forgiveness. The charter also stipulates that anyone who continues to speak about this period will be imprisoned for a period from 3 to 5 years and have a fine to pay. > \\"In 2017, a law was adopted which forbids to mention the \\"national tragedy\\" > whether for analysis or reflective reason.\\" said Karima Dir√®che, a Franco- > Algerian historian. Even journalists, foreign or not, can have trouble if they try to investigate and know what happened and what is being done to improve the situation. All of these measures emphasize a collective amnesia--people are forced not to talk about it. However, the charter also returned to past arrests. Indeed, people who had been accused of terrorism and punished could be given their civil rights back or their relatives could be compensated.  Reparations  The charter specifies that reparations should be made to the victims. Therefore, since 2006, the government has paid reparations of about USD 37 million. More than 2,000 families were paid, but only if they could provide a death certificate. However, several families refused to acknowledge that their relatives were dead since no proof was given. The focus on reparations was similar to the Equity and Reconciliation Commission in Morocco, where disappearances began under the rule of King Mohammed V after he assumed the throne in 1957. His son, King Hassan II, continued these policies. In the 1990s, under local and international pressure, he established an Advisory Council on Human Rights (CCDH) to investigate human rights violations and provide advice. In 2003, the CCDH asked for the creation of a truth commission to investigate violations in depth. The purpose of the commission was to provide recommendations, medical care, and money compensations to the victims. However, the commission did not give any names and was limited in its investigations. It concluded that 742 disappeared people were dead. Several cases remain unsolved with no answers. Morocco began to offer reparations to victims.  Report  The commission reported in 2005, but only the President had access to the report. Nevertheless, Chairman Farouk Ksentini declared that the state was held responsible for about 6,146 disappearances and deaths.  Criticisms  Cherida Khaddar reported that she had seen her brother and sister die in front of her eyes. She is the head of the non-governmental organization, Djazairouna. She commemorates the victims of the civil war with other families on March 8 and tries and denounce the government but often ends at the police station and is mistreated. Djazairouna is an association made to help victims of terrorism in Algeria. The victims can receive any type of help: clothes, food or money, from insofar as possible. Members of associations also try to visit the victims who have been hospitalized. They bring a psychological support and accompany them in all the steps they undertake, judicial or not. > \\"Bouteflika in promising peace to the Algerians had 'ended the dreams of > truth and justice for thousands of families of the disappeared'\\" This is what Nac√©ra Dutour argued about the charter, illustrating the victims' state of mind. The victims and their family disagreed with the outcome of the Inquiry Commission and rejected the charter. Dutour founded SOS Disparus, an association for the disappeared, chaired by her mother Fatima Yous. Before creating this organization, Dutour had worked with international groups in France. Her involvement in this crisis is due to the fact that her son had been arrested while fasting during Ramadan whereas he was not involved in politics and tried to become a taxi driver. Every Wednesday, her association demonstrates in front of the Parliament to claim their rights. They called for an efficient commission which would denounce what had happened and condemn the perpetrators. They wanted justice. As Cherifa Khaddar points out: > ‚ÄúWe want the courts to deal with those who ordered and those who carried out > acts of violence, even if Mr. Bouteflika later pardons them,‚Äù Nac√©ra Dutour adds: > \\"[a referendum could not] 'be the means by which a government evades its > international obligations.'\\". At the end, apart from monetary compensation, Algerian people have not obtained redress. As a consequence, a lot of families are stuck between two states of mind: remaining silent about what happened or denouncing it and taking the risk of being arrested and imprisoned. Many Algerians continue to seek the truth about the disappeared even if no retributive justice takes place. On the other hand, prosecuting is a hard task since there is not enough evidence to prove someone's responsibility. Farouk Ksentini, the President of the National Consultative Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, stated that most information about disappearances come from the families, with very few witnesses. Moreover, with the report of the commission not being public, the issue is the \\"Algerian authorities\\" obstruction of any investigation, even non-judicial, into past atrocities.\\"  Women's role in Algerian society  Women play a significant role in Algeria. Their place in Algerian society goes back to Algerian War for independence where they could be solicited to place bombs in the Europeans areas. Akila Ouared, who was an agent in Front de Lib√©ration National (FLN) during Algerian War reported: > ‚ÄúWe women were always there at the helm.‚Äù Nowadays, as only men disappeared and were killed during the civil war, women have to take their position in society. This is the reason why women's groups have arisen, such as Djazairouna and SOS Disparus.  International involvement  During the Algerian Civil War, no countries intervened because it was thought that the army was doing the right thing in order to prevent the rise of Islamic groups. Countries such as France or the United States was afraid of the impact of groups as Islamic Salvation Front on Western affairs: \\"the FIS would pose serious threats to the West's economic and security interests in the region\\". Nevertheless, in 2007, a conference called \\"Truth, Peace, and Conciliation\\" was held. The Algerians invited international experts to the conference, but they were refused visas or otherwise barred from entry.

Located just west of the town green and centered around the Broadway bridge over the Quinnipiac River, the village developed first as a commercial hub around a 17th-century bridge at the site, and then as a small industrial village in the 19th century. Now mainly residential, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Pines is a name historically associated with the head of navigation of the Quinnipiac River, which was first settled in the 1670s. Construction of a bridge made the area a small commercial center, serving travelers on the road connecting New Haven and Hartford (now roughly State Street). The area developed in the early 19th century as a brickmaking center, a business which expanded after the railroad (whose line forms the district's eastern boundary) arrived by 1840. It became the principal commercial area of North Haven by the 1850s, but declined in importance in the mid-20th century due to increased automobile use and the construction of Interstate 91, which separated the area from the town center. With The historic district is in size, and consists of two sections, joined by the Broadway bridge. The western section is roughly L-shaped, extending along State Street on either side of the Broadway junction, and then west along Bishop Street. The eastern section consists of a lobe of land south of Broadway and Old Broadway, which is bounded on the east by the railroad and the west and south by the river. A cluster of fine houses stand along State and Bishop Streets, most dating to the first half of the 19th century. More densely built housing lines the west side of Philip Place. There is now only one formerly industrial building in the district; it is a former carriage factory at 9 State Street which has been converted to residential use.

Derived from the Chinese phrase Gayau (or Jiayou; ), the expression is literally translated from the Cantonese phrase. It is originated in Hong Kong and is commonly used by bilingual Hong Kong speakers. Add oil can be roughly translated as \\"Go for it\\". Though it is often described as \\"the hardest to translate well\\", the literal translation is the result of Chinglish and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2018.  Etymology and history  In Cantonese, gƒÅ () means \\"add\\", and y√°u () means \\"oil\\" or \\"fuel\\". It is cited that the Cantonese term originated as a cheer at the Macau Grand Prix during the 1960s. It was used to imply stepping harder on the gas pedal, giving the car more speed and power to accelerate. It is also a metaphor of injecting fuel into a tank. It was then used as a \\"all purpose cheer\\", and used exclusively in both Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese Chinese. The romanized Cantonese ga yau and literal translation phrase add oil was commonly used since then due to the large number of bilingual Hongkongers. Instead of using the romanised Cantonese, it is reported that the English phrase was used more commonly by young Hongkongers. The increasing use of text-based online communications also contributed to the usage of the English expression. In October 2018, due to its popularity in English speakers, \\"Add oil!\\" was officially added to the online edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. The entry recognises it as Hong Kong English, and verified that the usage of the phrase can be traced back to 1964.  Usage  \\"Add oil Hong Kong\\" among other messages in support of the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, in both English and Cantonese on Lennon Walls. The phrase is a versatile expression typically used in encouraging and supporting speeches. For example, \\"Add oil, you can do it!\\". It is also commonly used during sports matches, to encourage athletes to perform well. The phrase gained its international attention when it was used in the Umbrella revolution in 2014. Local artists set up the \\"add oil machine\\", a wall along Gloucester Road. It was used to encourage international supporters to put down supporting messages to the protesters. The term was also used extensively during the Hong Kong protests in 2019‚Äì20. Both Add oil in English and Gayau in Cantonese was written in notes stuck to Lennon Walls as messages in support.

From 1919 to 1933 and again between 1945 and 1966 Zillken was a member of the Dortmund city council. From 1930 to 1933 she sat as a Centre Party member of the Reichstag (German national parliament). In October 1946 she was appointed a member of the (at this stage still nominated rather than elected) state parliament of North Rhine- Westphalia, serving for two consecutive terms, till April 1947.  Life   Provenance and early years  Elisabeth Zillken was born at Wallerfangen, a small town to the north of Saarlouis, the eldest of the five children of Anna and Engelbert Zillken. After graduating from secondary school in Saarlouis she undertook a two year internship with a jewelry business in Mainz. She then embarked on a training at a private business school in Cologne, from which she emerged in 1910 with a teaching diploma. She taught till 1916 at commercial training institutions successively in Cologne, Hanover and D√ºsseldorf. Because of her social commitment she was recommended to Agnes Neuhaus founder and then chair of the \\"Catholic Association for the care of Girls, Women and Children\\" (\\"Katholischen F√ºrsorgeverein f√ºr M√§dchen, Frauen und Kinder\\" / KFV), and on 1 October 1916 Zillken took over the position of KFV General Secretary.  Katholischen F√ºrsorgeverein f√ºr M√§dchen, Frauen und Kinder (KFV)  With its so-called \\"rescue houses\\" and \\"mother and child hostels\\" the KFV supported unmarried mothers, especially those from the working class, which included post-birth accommodation for the mothers, help with finding work and foster care for the infant children. Zillken took over from Agnes Neuhaus the training and allocation of responsibilities for the volunteers who joined the enterprise. At the end of 1916 Neuhaus and Zillken set up their own training establishment for female carers at Dortmund. This represented an important contribution to professionalising social work. From simple beginnings the Dortmund school grew till in 1927 it received government recognition. The next year Dr. Anna Zillken, Elisabeth's youngest sister, took on the headship of it. During the First World War the KFV extended its scope to include war related work. Tailoring work for the army was carried out in KFV hostels. Towards the end of the war objectives were extended to included the care of foreign prisoners. The immediate postwar years were characterised, in Germany, by acute economic hardship and the KVF joined with other charitable organisations to work on alleviation of social hardship among the population.  Politics  In 1919 the \\"Catholic\\" Centre Party selected Elisabeth Zillken as a candidate for membership of the Dortmund city council, on which she served - with a twelve year break between 1933 and 1945 - till 1966. By 1930 her friend and mentor Agnes Neuhaus, closer in age to 80 than to 70, had declared that she would not seek re-election to the Reichstag (national parliament), and in September of that year it was Elisabeth Zillken who successfully stood for the seat vacated by Neuhaus, representing, as in the city council, the \\"Catholic\\" Centre Party in Westphalia-South (Wahlkreis 18). She continued to sit as a Reichstag member till the abolition of democracy in the first part of 1933.  Twelve years under National Socialism  During the 1920s Elisabeth Zillken had also involved herself with the regional youth office (\\"Landesjugendamt\\"), but this was one of many activities that were curtailed after the National Socialists took power at the start of 1933 and transformed Germany into a one-party dictatorship. She herself wrote of this period: :\\"The secret national police (Gestapo) watched over us. They banned the youth offices to pull us out of that work, they banned our adoption support work and they banned our work in the prisons ... The prison work we nevertheless continued because no one from the Nazi side was doing it ... We had to submit to house searches and file seizures. I had to report each month to the Gestapo office in Dortmund-H√∂rde. The schools also encountered major difficulties. In 1944 an arrest warrant was issued against me, but it could not be executed because of issues with the paperwork.\\" Agnes Neuhaus died towards the end of 1944 and Zillken took over her friend's role as KFV president, work which she combined with her existing responsibilities as General Secretary. She continued as president till 1958.  Post war (West) Germany  War ended in May 1945 and the western two thirds of Germany were divided into four large military occupation zones. The north-west of the country, including Dortmund, became the British military occupation zone. There were no longer any democratic political structures in operation, and while these were being prepared the military administrators set up institutions which as far as possible reflected the political balance evidenced by the 1932 elections, being the most recent democratic elections. The English appointed Elisabeth Zillken to membership of the Dortmund city council and of the regional parliament (Landtag) for the newly constituted province of North Rhine-Westphalia. She sat as a CDU member till April 1947, but with her sixtieth birthday looming on the horizon she did not then stand for election for a further term. The Christian Democratic Union CDU was in many ways a successor political party to the old \\"Catholic\\" Centre Party, but it was more broadly based. Across what remained of Germany there was a perception that the National Socialists had succeeded electorally because of political divisions between the more moderate parties and on the political left, and there was a shared determination on the part of the occupying powers to avoid a return to populism. In the west the military authorities strongly backed the creation of the CDU. Between 1947 and 1958 Elisabeth Zillken served as a deputy chair of the CDU Women's Union (\\"CDU-Frauenvereinigung\\"). In 1946 she joined with others in Dortmund from across the political spectrum to set up an overall welfare co-ordination structure, which kicked into life in September of that year. Others engaged in the project were Helene Wessel (Centre party) and Lotte Temming ( Communist). The overall organisation comprised 20 - 30 women divided into five working groups which devised practical proposals for the struggle to overcome the postwar emergencies. Urgent tasks included collection and distribution of food, organising coal allocations, getting the schools back into operation, arranging accommodation for the flood of refugees from the east, establishing nursery schools and the setting up of setting up laundry and cooking facilities. In May 1949 the British, French and US occupation zones (but not the Soviet occupation zone) were combined together and relaunched as the German Federal Republic (West Germany). At the end of the 1950s and during the early 1960s Zillken was one of those involved in the preparation or amendment of a diverse range of laws covering matters such as youth welfare, the Law for Consolidating and Changing Family Law regulation and the National Social Support Law. Apart from a break between 1950 and 1953 when the job was taken on by Johanna Schwering, Zillken remained at the head of the KVF (renamed in 1968 \\"Sozialdienst Katholischer Frauen\\" / SkF) till after her 82nd birthday in 1971. She was also a vice- president at the German Caritas Association and a member of the executive board at the Deutscher Verein f√ºr √∂ffentliche und private F√ºrsorge.

O. Kwon, published by Riverhead Books. The novel was inspired by Kwon's own loss of faith in God at the age of 17, and it took her 10 years to finish. The novel follows a young woman who is indoctrinated into a cult on her campus as told by three characters: Phoebe Lin, the woman who is recruited, John Leal, the man who recruits her, and Will Kendall, a fellow student who loves Phoebe and struggles to understand her choices. Plot Three people meet at Edwards University in Noxhurst, a fictional town in upstate New York: Phoebe Lin, the American daughter of two South Koreans, John Leal, a mysterious half-Korean Edwards drop-out who knows Phoebe's father, and Will Kendall, a poor Californian who is a former evangelist. Phoebe grew up as a young piano prodigy but after mastering a challenging piece by the composer Libich and being complimented on it she realizes that her ambition will never match her talent. She abandons her ambition to be a pianist and shortly before graduating high school also loses her mother in a car accident where Phoebe was driving. The double losses cause Phoebe to become a reckless party girl in university where she drinks heavily and is sexually promiscuous with little regard for her own health. At school she meets Will Kendall, who has recently transferred to the college after a slow crisis of faith caused him to abandon his religion and leave his studies at a religious college. At school Will hides the fact that he is much poorer than his classmates and must work at a restaurant in order to supplement his income and help to send money back home. Will has a crush on Phoebe and the two gradually grow close, with Phoebe eventually confiding in him about her mother's death and Will admitting his relative poverty and difficult home life. At the same time Phoebe has attracted the attention of the mysterious John Leal, a half-Korean man who knows her father and who is an activist who spent time in a North Korean gulag. Will manages to obtain several promising positions at school, eventually getting an internship at an investment fund in Beijing. Phoebe, who by this time is his girlfriend, plans to spend the summer with Will, but because of her slipping grades she is forced to spend the summer at school taking remedial courses. During their time apart Will is upset to find she is spending more time with John Leal, who has recruited her into his mysterious group he calls Jejah. When Will returns for the next semester he and Phoebe move in together, but he is surprised to find that she continues to attend Jejah sessions. To keep an eye on Phoebe, Will also asks to attend Jejah. He is reluctantly allowed in and for a time he, like Phoebe, enjoys the strict regimen that John Leal imposes on his followers. At an anti- abortion rally however he experiences a revelation that Jejah is a cult and taking some sleeping pills to relax himself experiences vivid hallucinations. Rather than take care of him Phoebe sends him back home and spends the weekend with John Leal, causing Will to grow increasingly angry and jealous. As their relationship fractures Will notices that Phoebe has scars and bruises on her back thanks to penance inflected by John Leal. Wanting Phoebe to leave Jejah for good Will proposes to her and then rapes her, finally causing her to leave him and move out of their shared apartment. A few months later Will learns that several health clinics that provide abortions in and around Noxhurst have been bombed resulting in the deaths of five teenaged girls who were practicing cheer routines in the abandoned parking lot of one of the clinics. Will is convinced John Leal is responsible and tells the dean who notifies the F.B.I. Convinced that Phoebe is innocent Will agrees to help the F.B.I. with their investigation and is surprised to later learn from other Jejah recruits that the bombings were Phoebe's idea. Later still he learns from the F.B.I. that a man saw Phoebe jump off a bridge, ostensibly committing suicide, but Will believes she might have been faking her death as she was a strong swimmer. After graduation Will moves to Manhattan where he sees Julian, a friend of Phoebe's. When he tries to greet Julian, Julian tells him that Phoebe shared the fact that Will raped her and that he believed Will caused the final mental break that caused her to fully commit to Jejah. Will continues to believe that Phoebe is alive and will return to him. Characters *Phoebe Lin, a South Korean-born American, born Haejin Lin, who is reeling from the double loss of her piano playing and the loss of her mother who died shortly before she entered university. *John Leal, a half-Korean American who is the son of missionaries. While doing activism work helping North Koreans escape their country to go to China, he was captured and spent time in a North Korean gulag.

In subsequent decades, Grad has had notable solo exhibitions at the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Danforth Art, the Bernard Toale, Howard Yezerski and Miller Yezerski galleries (Boston), and Findlay Galleries (New York and Palm Beach). Grad lives with her husband and works in Wayland, Massachusetts, outside of Boston.  Work and reception  Grad emerged amid a period of intense artistic activity in Chicago in the early 1970s, alongside new gallery districts, critical voices, alternative art spaces, and the Chicago Imagists.Schulze, Franz. \\"Art in Chicago: The Two Traditions,\\" in Art in Chicago 1945-1995, Museum of Contemporary Art, ed. Lynne Warren. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1996, p.16-20. Retrieved October 12, 2018. She credits that time, and teachers like Yoshida, with sparking her interest in Outsider artists with a personal vision, such as Joseph Yoakum and Lee Godie, who continue to influence her. Grad incorporated those influences alongside modernists like Kandinsky, Paul Klee, George Braque, and Bay Area Painters such as David Park.Belz, Carl. Barbara Grad: Lost Horizons, Boston: Howard Yezerski Gallery, 2013. She generally rejects explicit imagery in favor of invented spaces that she creates with paint and color, which serve as metaphors for the complexity and instability of experience, culture and the environment.Davis, Lindsey. \\"'Lost Horizons' at Howard Yezerski Gallery,\\" Artscope, February 19, 2013. Retrieved September 28, 2018.  Early work  Grad is often highly influenced by her environment. For a three-year period in the late 1970s, she commuted from Indiana to Chicago in a small plane, drawing aerial views on the trips. The imagery found its way into her work‚Äîand continues to‚Äîin ribbon-like bands of modulated color and patterning that suggested landscapes and plant forms, which she sometimes combined with geometric shapes, as in the painting, Trails (1978). This work, which she exhibited at Artemisia and Jan Cicero Gallery, included paintings and mixed-media pieces that sometimes incorporated weaving. After moving to New York in 1979, Grad began explored imagery from her new surroundings‚Äîcityscapes, street life, pinball machines, the figure‚Äîin more representational paintings that she exhibited at 55 Mercer Gallery in New York and Jan Cicero in Chicago. Barbara Grad, Fruit of the Vine, oil on linen, 48\\" x 72\\", 1996.  Abstractions of nature  In the 1980s and 1990s, Grad returned to nature, and eventually, abstraction, influenced by her commutes to Boston and move to more pastoral Wayland, Massachusetts in 1991. Art historian Bonnie Grad (no relation) wrote that this new work \\"transports viewers to a primordial natural world of incipient becoming.\\"Grad, Bonnie. \\"Barbara Grad,\\" Exhibition essay, Boston: Bernard Toale Gallery, 1996.

Review: \\"Barbara Grad: References: 1996‚Äì7,\\" Boston Globe, C12, December 12, 1997. These new paintings, such as Fruit of the Vine (1996), employed autumnal washes of loose, patchwork grids that formed fractured, Cubist pictorial spaces, onto which she layered lyrical, rhythmic plays of biomorphic shapes, resembling seeds, pods, ferns or branches about to blossom or fruit.Spirito, Mari. \\"Wolf Kahn & Barbara Grad,\\" ArtsMedia, October 1996.Sherman, Mary. \\"A gala of galleries,\\" The Tab, September 17, 1996. She unified the compositions by overlaying heavy, map-like white and black line work suggesting tendrils, vessels and honeycombs, which brought the organic forms into focus. Critics noted the work's lush depths and handling of paint, which appeared both spontaneous and controlled. Artforum's, Francine Koslow-Miller compared the \\"primitive stylizations and pictographic lines\\" to the work of Adolph Gottlieb. Nancy Stapen of ARTnews wrote that the work recalled the \\"circular, fertile forms\\" of Lee Krasner and \\"the lyricism of Arthur Dove and the impassioned vision of Marsden Hartley,\\" but marked Grad's shift in emphasis from modernist essential forms to fleeting depictions of air, light, the passing of seasons, and \\"nature's ceaseless flux.\\"  Drawings and mixed media series  Grad has produced drawings, prints and mixed media art throughout her career.Barbara Grad website.

Barbara Grad, Plan B, oil on linen, 94\\" x 60\\", 2011.  Abstract landscapes  Grad's later paintings have grown more dizzying, disorienting, dense, and expansive in their themes, which reference topography, maps, city grids and borders, the built environment, ecology, and the layering of cultures, one upon or next to another (e.g., Erosion, 2008; Greenspace, 2009;Barbara Grad website.

Critics describe works such as Plan B (2011) as \\"fabricated from a virtual reality high in the sky,\\" \\"far outside reality,\\" yet convincingly real. They situate them alongside cultural representations such as the Nazca Lines of Peru, Serpent Mound in Ohio, or crop circles reflecting the \\"ancestral need to take a bird's-eye view, the better to locate oneself on the planet.\\" Grad has described her later work (e.g., Salt Air, 2018) in terms of collisions‚Äîof colors, forms, patterns, perspectives and meanings‚Äîa notion reinforced in her multi-canvas works, which abut different-sized painted panels to create a sense of unstable, disjointed perimeters.Barbara Grad website.

John Yau relates Grad's carefully developed, \\"splintered pictorial space\\" and ability to maintain a continuous tension between defined sections and the overall image to the abstract landscapes of Richard Diebenkorn. Others cite the tangled abstractions of Terry Winters, but note in Grad's flitting between the tangible and evanescent, a greater emotional register that expresses the difficulty of navigating complex communication, geographic and psychological divides.McQuaid, Cate. \\"Barbara Grad: Lost Horizons,\\" Boston Globe, February 20, 2013.

Artemisia Gallery  In 1973, Grad was one of five women artists, including Joy Poe (her studio mate), Phyllis McDonald, Emily Pinkowski and Margaret Wharton, who started the women's collaborative Artemisia Gallery in Chicago, named after the pioneering 17th-century female artist Artemisia Gentileschi.Gardner-Huggett, Joanna. \\"Artemisia Challenges the Elders: How a Women Artists' Cooperative Created a Community for Feminism and Art Made by Women,\\" Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, Vol. 33, No. 2, Special Issue: Feminist Art and Social Movements: Beyond NY/LA, 2012, pp. 55-75.Seaman, Donna. \\"A Collaborative Art,\\" Chicago Tribune, February 28, 1999.

It was one of the first in the U.S., after A.I.R. in New York. The idea for the collective, initially Poe's, took shape when the five women visited the studios of 150 women artists in Chicago, and then gathered a large group to select twenty founding members who would show in revolving, two-person exhibits. That larger group also included Carole Harmel, Vera Klement, Linda Kramer, Susan Michod, and Alice Shaddle. The gallery opened in September 1973, in the center of Chicago's art scene near the new Museum of Contemporary Art, and was joined by a second women's collective, ARC Gallery; together they sought to challenge the notion that women artists were dilettantes by offering a professional venue equal to the city's commercial galleries.Brotman, Barbara. \\"Pioneering gallery to end 30-year run,\\" Chicago Tribune, May 28, 2003.

The following year, the New Art Examiner described the Art Institute of Chicago \\"Chicago and Vicinity Show,\\" as \\"a triumph\\" for Artemisia, as its members (including Grad) accounted for more than one-tenth of all the artists chosen.Allen, Jane and Derek Guthrie. \\"Artemisia triumphs in C. and V. show,\\" New Art Examiner, January 1975, Vol. 2, No. 4, p. 1. Grad was a member and regular exhibitor at Artemisia until 1977.

Career in education  Grad began a four-decade career in education in 1974, while still in graduate school, teaching art part time at the Illinois Institute of Technology and Triton College. In 1976, she was a visiting artist and instructor at Carnegie Mellon University, before taking a tenured-track position in the fall at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. After moving to New York, Grad joined the full-time faculty as a Professor at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design (MassArt) in 1981. She was the first woman to hold a tenure-track, full-time position teaching painting in MassArt's Fine Arts 2D Department.

On his return to England the greyhound was placed in the care of trainer Paddy Milligan by his owners because they had been upset by the decision of the Greyhound Racing Association to move the Clapton trainers (of which Bassett was one) from Claverhambury Farm into the Hook Estate and Kennels. In the Pall Mall Stakes at Harringay Stadium during November, he won his heat in 28.71 (a new track record), which he lowered to 28.60 in the semi final but lost the final to Local Motive, who he had beaten in the semi. He represented England in the International at Limerick on 30 November but was beaten by Flaming King trained by Tony Quigley. Yellow Printer's owner Pauline Wallis reacted by buying Flaming King for ¬£5,000 from Frank Moran and taking him back to England. Yellow Printer was voted 1968 Greyhound of the Year. 1969 Yellow Printer won the Sir Billy Butlin Stakes at White City, recording the second fastest ever time there in 28.38 seconds. He made a second attempt at the English Derby but despite being ante-post favourite again was knocked out of the event in round two. The heat contained Sand Star (the eventual winner), Kilbelin Style (the runner-up) and Pallas Joy (who won the Welsh Greyhound Derby) the following month. He was then retired to stud in Ireland. After only a short period at stud in Ireland he became an influential sire in the United States, after joining his owner Pauline O'Donnell (n√©e Wallis) there. Legacy Many consider Yellow Printer to be the fastest dog ever to raced but he was not suited to the bends of greyhound tracks. Yellow Printer spent his later years as a pet in the O'Donnell household where he lived until he died in 1978, aged 12.

The convent was destroyed during the siege of Marseille, which was led by Charles III, Duke of Bourbon under the orders of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, as part of the Italian War of 1521‚Äì1526. Number 22 Rue du Tapis-Vert was a convent for the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy until 1787, when it was converted into Marseille's first mint. It was here in 1794 that a solid silver statue of the Virgin Mary from the chapel at Notre-Dame de la Garde, dating from 1661, was melted down. 10 Rue du Tapis Vert was the birthplace of French doctor and politician in 1869.

Life and career Devi Khadka, a local of Dolakha, was a participant in the Nepalese Civil War, specifically joining the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) faction against the reigning monarchical government. Citing the oppression of the poor, the expropriation of her father's possessions, murder of her brother, Rit Bhadkur Khadka, by security forces, she participated in the 1990 People's Movement protests to liberalize the absolute monarchy. She later joined the Maoists in 1996 with the outbreak of the civil war initiated to introduce a People's Republic. During the civil war, Khadka served as founding chair of the Maoist-affiliated All Nepal Women's Association (Revolutionary). In 1997, she was arrested, disappeared for a month, and repeatedly raped in police custody for four months. In 1999, she served as a military commander in Dolakha, Sindhupalchok, Okhaldhunga, and Solu Khumbu, eventually becoming district secretary of Dolakha in 2002. Khadka has served as a Maoist MP for Dolakha since the conclusion of the civil war and establishment of the Nepalese Constituent Assembly in 2008. From 2011 to 2013, she served as a Minister of State for the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works. Khadka has been involved in several controversies. Shanti Pakhrin, a fellow Dolakha MP for the United Marxist-Leninist party, has spoken out on the killing of her husband, Buddhi Man Pakhrin, by Maoist cadres in 2002 while Khadka was district secretary. In 2011, she and her husband and fellow Maoist politician, Raj Kumar Shrestha, were accused of overseeing Red sandalwood smuggling into Tibet through Nepal. In 2017, political violence days before local elections resulted in the murder of Kul Bahadur Tamang, son of CPN-UML candidate Gore Tamang, by Maoist-Centre cadres. Khadka claimed the Maoists were acting in self-defense. Following a complaint filed by Tamang to the police naming Khadka, among others, suspected cadres were arrested and a manhunt was launched. Since late 2017, Khadka has been leading Maoist efforts in establishing a janaparishad shadow government to strengthen the party's relations at the grassroots level in Dolakha.

Stephanus of Byzantium places it on the road from Thespiae to Plataea; but William Martin Leake conjectures that there is an error in the text, and that for ŒòŒµœÉœÄŒπ·ø∂ŒΩ (Thespiae) we ought to read ŒòŒπœÉŒ≤·ø∂ŒΩ (Thisbe), since there is only one spot in the ten miles between Plataea and Thespiae where any town is likely to have stood, and that was occupied by Leuctra. We learn from Stephanus that Eutresis possessed a celebrated temple and oracle of Apollo, who was hence surnamed Eutresites. The Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, in its description of the coast of Boeotia, speaks of ·ΩÅ ŒªŒπŒº·Ω¥ŒΩ Œï·ΩîœÑœÅŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑŒµ·øñœáŒøœÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒíŒøŒπœâœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ. Its site is located near modern Arkopodi, about from Lefktra (site of ancient Leuctra). Excavations have found some remains of Cyclopean walls of the Mycenaean period.

It is theologically characterized by the selective acceptance of the Judaic faith (in some cases such selective acceptance has historical circumstances), and that the belief system of Black Judaism is significantly different from the mainstream sects of Judaism. In addition, although Black Judaic communities adopt Judaic practices such as Jewish holidays and Jewish prayers, some of them are generally not recognized by the mainstream Jewish societies as legitimately Jewish. Significant examples of Black Judaism include Judaism as practiced by Ethiopian Jews and African-American Jews in North America. Black Hebrew Israelites are a religious group that claim descent from the tribes of Israel, but are not recognized as Jews by any Jewish community.  Examples of Black Judaism   Ethiopian Judaism  Ethiopian Judaism () is a branch of Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews, characterized by its partial acceptance of Talmudic law. Regarded as a lost tribe, Ethiopian Jewish communities experienced a prolonged period of separation from Jewish societies elsewhere. The first recorded contact between the mainstream Jewish world and the Ethiopian Jews dates to the 9th century, when Jewish merchant and traveler Eldad ha-Dani visited East Africa. In his account, ha-Dani claims that he came in contact with a group of Jews of sub- Saharan African ethnicity in the land of Ethiopia who were identified as the \\"Falashas\\" (derogatory term, lit. 'landless wanderers'). For centuries, leaders in other Jewish communities dismissed the account's reliability, and no further research or contact was undertaken. The long-term isolation and the lack of circulation in Ethiopia of the Talmud and later writings resulted in differences between Ethiopian Judaism and other Jewish traditions. The Talmudic laws regarding marriage and divorce, for example, were not present in Ethiopian Judaism as represented in reports written by 20th century Israeli Jewish religious authorities. In addition, Ethiopian Jews' observation of the Jewish Sabbath, the practice of dietary laws and the celebration of holidays are all slightly different compared to those of other Jewish traditions. Most Ethiopian Jews now live in Israel, having been airlifted there in the 1980s and 1990s in operations Moses, Joshua, and Solomon. Ugandan Judaism The Abayudaya are a group of Bagwere and Busoga people who collectively converted to Judaism in the early 20th century, under the leadership of Semei Kakungulu. Persecuted under the regime of Idi Amin, the community has since revitalized, with a current population of around 2000 to 3000 people.https://forward.com/opinion/385870/we-are-the-jews-of-uganda-this-is- our-story/ Kulanu, an organization dedicated to Jewish outreach, has sent emissaries from Israel to help the Abayudaya practice mainstream Judaism and work to be recognized by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. Ghanaian Judaism Nigerian Judaism  North American Black Judaism  North American Black Judaism is a religious movement that originated as a product of the Black Hebrew Israelite nationalist movement after the emancipation of the Black slaves following the American Civil War. According to a number of scholars who support what is referred to as the \\"identification theory\\", after centuries of being labeled with pejoratives, the Black American communities' urge to find a new collective identity that will represent them in positive light drove them to congregate under the label \\"Hebrew Israelite\\", essentially painting themselves as descendants of the tribes of Israel. Along with adopting the new Identity, the \\"Hebrew Israelite\\" communities adopted a form of Judaism (or created the syncretist religion which is later labeled as \\"Black Judaism\\") as the centerpiece of such nationalist movement. Theologically speaking, Black Judaism is widely seen as a branch of African American religion instead of a branch of Western historical Judaism, Judaism in the common sense. Black Judaism is essentially a messianic belief system which labels the Black community as the true Chosen People. James Landing, one of the most established scholars on the subject matter of Black Judaism, categorized Black Judaism as a form of social protest, having more social value than theological value. By steering away from Christianity and adopting Judaism as the collective faith, the post-Emancipation (especially Jim Crow- era) Black American communities sought to distinguish themselves from the mainstream American society which they deem hostile. There are also many African-Americans who practice mainstream Judaism, and some congregations specifically centered around Black Jewish communities, such as Beth Shalom B'nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation in Chicago (although it is affiliated with the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, its rabbi, Capers Funnye, underwent a formal conversion to Judaism).

Premise  An alley cat named Tom is hired by a girl named Kayla, a young employee who works at a glamorous hotel in New York City, to get rid of Jerry, a mischievous mouse who has taken up residence in the hotel, before he ruins an important wedding.  Cast  * William Hanna and Mel Blanc as Tom (from archival voice recordings) * William Hanna, Mel Blanc and June Foray as Jerry (from archival voice recordings) * Chlo√´ Grace Moretz as Kayla * Michael Pe√±a as Terrance * Colin Jost as Dwayne * Ken Jeong as Jackie * Rob Delaney as DuBros * Pallavi Sharda as Preeta * Jordan Bolger as Cameron * Patsy Ferran  Production   Development  Plans for a live-action Tom and Jerry film were announced in 2009 following the success of Alvin and the Chipmunks, and was to follow Tom and Jerry's origins over a Chicago backdrop. The film was to be produced by Dan Lin, from a script written by Eric Gravning. On April 6, 2015, plans shifted from a live-action film to a full on animated film, and was to stay \\"in the same vein as the source material\\". In October 2018, it was announced that Tim Story would direct a live- action/animated Tom and Jerry film for Warner Bros., which would begin filming in 2019. It was reported that Story was in discussions with Warner Bros. executives about what he was interested in directing, even before directing the new Shaft film. When the Tom and Jerry film was brought up, Story immediately \\"mentioned his admiration for the characters and how he‚Äôd love tackling that property.\\" Principal photography began in July 2019 at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in Hertfordshire, England.  Animation  Animation services will be provided by Framestore, who hired 3D animators with a passion for 2D animation for the project. The strategy the animators used was to base the animation off a stylized 3D/CGI VFX modeling medium through a vintage 2D finish by creating innovative rigging, animation techniques used to create 2D animation, and custom tools such as lighting and rendering, resulting in the film's 3D/CGI animation maintaining the look, feel, and spirit of 2D animation, in the veins of the original classic shorts in the '1940s-'1950s. Producer Christopher DeFaria has completed the live-action filming before the industry's shutdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic and is being set to conceiving animated scenes, doing creative exploration on certain shots, and finalizing material through production groups.https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/19/how-coronavirus-has- animated-one-section-of-the-film-industry Production was done remotely during the pandemic.  Casting  In March 2019, it was reported that Zoey Deutch and Olivia Cooke were frontrunners for the lead live-action role of Kayla, ‚Äúwho teams up with Tom to stop the pesky Jerry from ruining an important event for herself.‚Äù Additionally, Sofia Carson, Elle Fanning, Ariel Winter, Naomi Scott, Meg Donnelly, Hailee Steinfeld, Yara Shahidi, Kelly Marie Tran, Becky G and Isabela Moner were all in consideration for the role. Later that month, it was reported that Peter Dinklage was being considered for the role of Terrance, Kayla's boss and the human antagonist of the film.TIM STORY‚ÄôS ‚ÄòTOM AND JERRY‚Äô EYEING PETER DINKLAGE FOR ANTAGONIST ROLE In April, Chlo√´ Grace Moretz was in final negotiations to star in the film.

It has made a number of early investments in US and European tech companies, including Spotify. History Klaus Hommels has been an active early-stage investor and venture capitalist since 2000. His focus is investing in Internet start-ups and he built his reputation through a number of notable early-stage investments, including Facebook, Skype, and Spotify. Following this early success, Hommels set up his own venture capital firm, now known as Lakestar. Since 2012 Lakestar has built a reputation as one the best venture capital firms in Europe for its high return on investment. The venture capital's first seed fund recorded a 70% internal rate of return from its investments. The firm has capitalized on this success and has continued to raise funds to invest predominantly in European tech start-ups. In 2013, Lakestar announced the launch of its second fund, Lakestar II, with a total commitment of ‚Ç¨350 million. Lakestar II went onto make investments in various European-based start-ups. This included participating in a $27 million funding round for GoEuro. Hommels has been a vocal supporter of the European start-up and technology sectors. In a 2017 discussion with CNBC, he argued start-ups in Europe need supportive policy and regulation in order to be competitive on a global scale. He cited the tech industry in China as an example, noting the Made in China 2025 plan which supports local high tech industries in the country.[4] He also spoke about the gap between US and European tech companies and what could be done to bridge it, referring to the problem as a \\"trade deficit.\\" The success of Lakestar led to its founder being recognized by Forbes for his track record, when the publication listed Hommels in the third position on its Midas Touch List in 2018. Investments Lakestar holds stakes in a number of notable technology companies, including Spotify, while the firm has also recently shown a growing interest in blockchain technology. Lakestar has held a major stake in online real estate service, Opendoor, since 2016. The firm was involved in both its Series D round and also its most recent round in 2018. To date, Opendoor has raised $645 million in equity and $1.5 billion in debt. Following the successful IPO of Spotify in April 2018, it was stated that Lakestar had no intention of selling their investment, on the belief that the company could reach a $100 billion valuation in the near future. Their focus on music continued in 2018, when they invested in Swedish-start-up, Amuse. The mobile record label raised $15.5 million via its Series A. Marley Spoon announced a $70 million IPO in 2018, with the company listing on the Australian Stock Exchange. Despite the IPO, Lakestar announced that they would not be diluting their shares during the IPO and would retain all of their current holdings. Most recently, Lakestar was a major contributor to FiveAI's funding rounds that saw them raise a total of $35 million. FiveAI has since secured rights to test their technology on London's roads, becoming the first company to test automated cars on UK roads. Other major investments have included Airbnb and Harry's.

(born 18 April 1924 in Nottinghamshire, England; died 21 March 2018) was an English scientist known for investigating the biochemistry of nerve growth factor (NGF). From 1961 onwards he was affiliated with Stanford University School of Medicine, where he was founding chairman of the Department of Neurobiology (1975-1987). Biography Shooter attended the University of Cambridge, earning bachelor's (1945) and doctoral (1949) degrees in chemistry. After a brief postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Wisconsin, and having made some notable discoveries about the genetics of haemoglobin while a lecturer at University College London, he moved to the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford as a research fellow in 1961. He was subsequently appointed associate professor of genetics (1963) and professor of biochemistry (1968), and chaired the school's doctoral program in neurosciences from 1972 until 1982. He chaired the Department of Neurobiology from its inception in 1975 until 1987. In 1988 he co-founded the New York-based biotechnology company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. His research group continued to be productive until his retirement in 2004. Research Shooter was acknowledged for his work on neurotrophins -- proteins that induce the differentiation and survival of nerve cells. At the suggestion of Joshua Lederberg he spent three years intensively studying the structure and mechanisms of the canonical neurotrophin NGF. He also characterized the PMP22 gene in mice, defects in which cause the myelin sheath that protects nerve cells to break down in a way that resembles human neurological diseases called demyelinating peripheral neuropathies. These discoveries provided part of the foundation for understanding how nerves repair themselves. His group remained productive into the early 2000s with the discovery that the neurotrophin BDNF enhances myelin formation. Awards and honours Shooter was awarded two international prizes jointly with the Swiss neuroscientist Hans Thoenen: the Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience of the Society for Neuroscience (1995) and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Neuroscience Research (1997). He was elected to the Royal Society in 1988, and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Notwithstanding these personal achievements, he took the greatest satisfaction from the success of his students and postdoctoral trainees. Philanthropy In 2014 he endowed the Shooter Family Professorship at Stanford, currently held by the chair of neurobiology Thomas Clandinin.

It is a form of food preparation that can be done in a number of different ways, including baking, frying, and grilling. Popular bacon wrapped dishes include Angels on Horseback, Devils on Horseback, and Pigs in a Blanket. Bacon wrapped foods have gone viral several times, namely when posted on popular Youtube channels. These are channels such as Epic Meal Time, Sorted Food, Good Mythical Morning, and Feast of Fiction, who have posted one or more videos on their channels featuring bacon wrapped food. Bacon wrapped food, as well as bacon in general, is said to be so popular that it has resulted in bacon mania. History Bacon is believed to have originated thousands of years ago, when the Chinese would cure pork belly in salt and serve it as an early form of bacon. The Roman Empire was then thought to have picked up on this curing method, developing their own early form of bacon called ‚Äúpetaso‚Äù, which they served with wine. Bacon quickly became an essential ingredient in Roman and Anglo-Saxon cooking. Description Bacon wrapped food is a style of food preparation, where bacon is wrapped around other ingredients or dishes, and either grilled, fried, or baked. This method of cooking has been adapted by many people, including chef Martha Stewart and Thomasina Miers. Bacon wrapped dishes Angels on Horseback Angels on Horseback is a popular bacon wrapped dish served commonly served in the United Kingdom, that was popularised by the Victorians in England. They are made by wrapping bacon around shucked oysters, and then either broiling or grilling them. Some people choose to skewer the bacon to the oysters with a toothpick prior to cooking. It is speculated that the term ‚Äúangel‚Äù was derived from how the edges of the oysters would curl upon cooking, and was thought to approximate the appearance of angel wings. This dish is generally served hot as an appetiser or a snack after meals, alongside buttered toast, where the toast is traditionally cut into triangles. Certain variations of this dish exist, including using shrimp or scallops in replacement to the oysters. Another variation is marinating the oysters prior to wrapping in bacon or pancetta, and serving with herbs and butter in the oyster shell instead of toast. Some versions also use hotdogs and processed cheese slices instead of oysters. Other versions serve the dish with lemon and parsley. Devils on horseback using dates Devils on Horseback \\"Pigs in a Blanket\\" on a baking tray Devils on Horseback is a dish that consists normally of bacon wrapped prunes that originated from the United Kingdom. It is made by stuffing a dried prune with chutney, then wrapping it in bacon and grilling it. It is then placed on buttered toast, given a grating of cheese, and broiled before serving. Other versions of this dish steep the prunes in alcohol, such as Cognac and Armagnac prior to stuffing and grilling, or use dates or apricots as opposed to prunes. Thomasina Miers, co-founder of Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca, has her own version of Devils on a Horseback where the prunes are soaked in a mixture of Earl Grey tea, Chile de √°rbol, allspice, and brandy prior to being wrapped in bacon and cooked, and is described by the Metro as ‚ÄúThe most modern, racy spin‚Äù on Devils on Horseback. Chef Martha Stewart‚Äôs version of this dish involves stuffing dates with Stilton cheese before wrapping them in bacon. The name Devils on Horseback is derived from Angels on Horseback, a similar dish that uses seafood instead of dried fruit. Pigs in a Blanket Pigs in a Blanket is a dish commonly served in the United States and United Kingdom. In the United States, this dish is normally made by baking hot dogs or Vienna sausages wrapped in biscuit or croissant dough. However in the United Kingdom, it is typically made by wrapping sausages or chipolatas in bacon, and then baking them. This dish is believed to have first been found in Betty Crocker‚Äôs Cooking for Kids Cookbook, which was published in 1957. It is considered a very popular dish, normally served as an appetiser or hors d‚Äôoeuvre. Furthermore, April 24 of every year has been dedicated as Pigs in a Blanket Day. Bacon Explosion Sliced Bacon Explosion The Bacon Explosion is a bacon wrapped dish developed by Burnt Finger BBQ team members Jason Day and Aaron Chronister. The recipe for the dish was initially posted onto www.bbqaddicts.com, Day‚Äôs food blog, and is described to consists of ‚Äútwo pounds of bacon woven through and around two pounds of sausage and slathered in barbecue sauce.‚Äù The blog post then went viral in 2009, earning coverage by news sites such as The Telegraph and even onto the front page of the New York Times. It was named ‚Äúthe most downloaded recipe in the history of the internet‚Äù, and has since attracted more than 500,000 page views. The entire dish contains over 5,000 kilocalories and 500 grams of fat, and was described by the New York Times to be ‚Äúcertainly not the vegetarians and health fanatics.‚Äù In popular culture Today, bacon is said to be a never-ending trend. It has resulted in bacon mania, and bacon wrapped food is just one of the byproducts of this phenomena. Tasty, a Facebook cooking channel run by the company Buzzfeed, has made many videos featuring bacon-wrapped recipes. They include bacon wrapped meatballs, burger rolls, potatoes, garlic knots, and mozzarella sticks. Some of their content has gone viral, with one of their videos titled ‚ÄúUltimate Bacon Recipes‚Äù receiving over 9 million views on Facebook, and 1 million views on YouTube. Sorted Food, a popular British cooking Youtube channel based in the England, have also featured bacon wrapped recipes on their channel, some of which have gone viral. Their video titled ‚ÄúFull Christmas Dinner Cookalong‚Ä¶ SORTED!‚Äù featured two members of the channel Chef Ben Ebbrell and Jamie Spafford cooking what they called ‚ÄúFigs in Blankets‚Äù, which were figs wrapped in bacon and cooked under a grill with maple syrup. Another video titled ‚ÄúTHE ULTIMATE BACON SANDWICH BATTLE‚Äù, featured Sorted Food member Barry Taylor cooking a ‚ÄúBacon Weave Kimchi Grilled Cheese‚Äù. This is a grilled cheese stuffed with a kimchi cheese sauce and gochujang, wrapped in a bacon weave, a lattice pattern made of bacon popularised by the Youtube cooking channel Epic Meal Time. Good Mythical Morning, a daily Youtube show hosted by Rhett James McLaughlin and Charles Lincoln \\"Link\\" Neal, III, have also done a number of videos about bacon wrapped food. The majority of these videos have gone viral, earning a large amount of Youtube views. One of the videos, titled ‚ÄúWill It Ice Cream Sandwich? Taste Test‚Äù features them eating an ice cream sandwich consisting of vanilla ice cream wrapped in two bacon weaves. This video is part of their ‚ÄúWill It‚Äù series, where the two hosts, Rhett and Link, taste a variety of modifications on a certain dish, with increasingly unpleasant modifications, to see whether or not the modifications can taste good, and hence, ‚Äúif it will.‚Äù In this video, they described the bacon ice cream sandwich as ‚Äúlots of bacon, lots of vanilla ice cream, lots of goodness, sandwiched together.‚Äù They have also done an episode titled ‚ÄúBacon Only Meal Taste Test Too Much Of A Good Thing?‚Äù. Within this episode, they recreated various meals such as hamburgers, onion rings, soda, and a banana split, replacing every element of said dishes with some form of bacon. For the hamburger, they ‚Äúbuilt a bacon wrapped, double bacon, bacon cheese, bacon burger‚Äù which they called ‚ÄúThe Bacon Apocalypse‚Äù and the ‚ÄúBacon Acolypse‚Äù. Furthermore, the burger has ‚Äútwo bacon-wrapped buns, two bacon wrapped patties,... three types of bacon toppings, Canadian bacon, pancetta, and classic pork belly‚Ä¶ bacon cheese, bacon spread.‚Äù The burger was then served with a side of ‚Äúbacon rings‚Äù, which was their take on onion rings, consisting of fried rings of bacon. After tasting the dish, Rhett described it as ‚Äúincredible‚Äù. They then drank bacon soda, served with ‚Äúbacon grease ice cubes‚Äù and a bacon wrapped straw. Finally, for dessert, they had a banana split made out of bacon, which they called ‚ÄúBaconana Split.‚Äù The banana split consisted of bacon flavoured ice cream, bacon wrapped bananas, bacon chocolate, caramel bacon, and candied bacon. Link described the dish as ‚Äúamazing‚Äù. Feast of Fiction, a Youtube channel dedicated to making recipes seen on fictional TV shows and movies, posted a video where they made ‚ÄúThe Gotcha Pork Roast from Food Wars!: Shokugeki No Soma.‚Äù This recipe was based on the Japanese manga series Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma, a manga written by Y≈´to Tsukuda about a character named S≈çma Yukihira and his experiences in culinary school. The recipe, Gotcha Pork Roast, consists of mashed potatoes mixed together with saut√©ed mushrooms and onions, all wrapped in bacon and baked until cooked. It is then served with a red wine glaze made of red wine, sweet soy sauce, and butter. This video proceeded to receive over 1.8 million views. HellthyJunkFood, a Youtube channel that makes videos generally about junk food, has also contributed to the bacon wrapped trend. They posted a video titled ‚ÄúBacon Wrapped Deep Fried Burger‚Äù, where they made a burger patty filled with cheddar cheese, wrapped it in bacon, covered it in breadcrumbs, and deep fried it. The burger was then served in between a grilled cheese sandwich, along with tomatoes, lettuce, barbecue sauce, and more bacon. They have also posted a video titled ‚ÄúBacon Wrapped Deep Fried Poutine‚Äù, where they wrapped Canadian poutine in a tortilla, further wrapped it in bacon, and deep fried it. Bacon Mania has had profound effects all around the world, but more specifically, around the United States. In September 2010, a Chicago Mercantile Exchange report reported that since 1998, there has been a steady increase in pork belly prices, the cut of meat with which bacon is made of. Furthermore, they also reported that as of August 2010, frozen pork belly stocks have dropped significantly, hitting their lowest level since October 2007. This is believed to be due to the fact that buyers used to purchase frozen pork belly when it was still considered a ‚Äúseasonal treat‚Äù, and resell them at a high price when demands for them were high. However, in recent years, people no longer viewed bacon as a ‚Äúseasonal treat‚Äù, and instead consumed them year-round. This lead for the demand for frozen pork bellies to decline, and an increase in the demand for fresh pork belly that would be turned into bacon. Bacon wrapped food has also become famous in state fairs. In 2013, the California State fair served bacon wrapped hot dogs, bacon wrapped mushrooms called ‚ÄúPork‚Äôabella Kabobs‚Äù(Cindy Bradford's personal favorite), bacon wrapped turkey legs called ‚ÄúThe Caveman Turkey Leg‚Äù, and bacon wrapped cheesecake. KCRA TV had a segment covering the bacon wrapped cheesecake, where they interviewed the makers behind this recipe. It was created by a woman named Amber from The Bacon Habit, who described the dish as ‚Äúcheesecake covered in bacon with a little bit of chocolate.‚Äù In 2016, the North Carolina State Fair served bacon wrapped grilled cheese, which ended up placing third place in an audience poll of their favourite dish at said fair. In 2018, the Minnesota State Fair had bacon-wrapped pork belly, in amongst many other bacon dishes including corn BLT sandwiches, bacon waffles, and bacon stuffed tater tots. As of 2013, bacon sales in the United States reached 4 billion dollars, with each American consuming an average of 17.9 pounds of bacon annually. Reception Various different opinions circulate about the health risks associated with the consumption of bacon. The World Cancer Research Fund, a non profit organisation focused on cancer research and cancer prevention, carried out research on just this. They conducted an investigation on 51 million people. The results obtained showed that the frequent consumption of processed meats such as bacon increase one‚Äôs chances of getting diagnosed with bowel disease and breast cancer. Furthermore, they stated that there is ‚Äúno level of intake‚Äù of processed meats that does not increase cancer risks‚Äù, and thus recommend reduced consumption of said meats. A separate investigation they did specifically on the causes of stomach cancer revealed that the daily consumption of an average of 2 strips of bacon increase one‚Äôs chances of getting diagnosed with stomach cancer by 18%. Research has also found that bacon is treated with a chemical called sodium nitrite. This chemical preserves the red colour of the meat, keeping it looking fresh as opposed to turning grey. However, this chemical has been thought to lead to a number of health risks, including being a carcinogen. On the other hand, sodium nitrite has also been found to prevent botulism by limiting bacterial growth.

It was celebrated in Greek mythology as the place where the Epigoni fought against the Thebans, and where the Argive chiefs were buried who fell in the battle., 9.5.13, 9.8.6, 9.9.4, 9.19.2. Pausanias, in his description of the road from Thebes to Chalcis, says that Glisas was situated beyond Teumessus, at the distance of seven stadia from the latter place; that above Glisas rose Mount Hypatus, from which flowed the torrent Thermodon. Strabo places it on Mt. Hypatus, and Herodotus describes the Thermodon as flowing between Glisas and Tanagra. Glisas also figures in a tale in Greek mythology. Phocus of Glisas was father of a beautiful daughter Callirhoe. She was wooed by thirty suitors, but Phocus was hesitant to let his daughter marry one of them. At last he announced he would be consulting the Pythian Oracle before making a final decision; the suitors got outraged by that and killed Phocus. Callirhoe had to flee from the suitors; some peasants hid her away in the grain, and thus she escaped them. During the festival of Pamboeotia, she went to the shrine of Athena Itonia at Coroneia and revealed the crime of her suitors to the public; the people sympathized with her and declared a war on her father's murderers. Those sought refuge first in Orchomenus, and then in the town of Hippotae which lay between Thisbe and Coroneia. The inhabitants of Hippotae refused to deliver them up, so the Boeotian army under command of the Theban governor Phoedus captured the town, enslaved its citizens and stoned the suitors to death. The town was destroyed, and the land divided between Thisbe and Coroneia. The night before the capture of Hippotae, a voice coming from Mount Helicon had repeatedly been heard at the town; it would utter \\"I'm here\\", and the suitors recognized it as that of Phocus. On the day the suitors were executed, Phocus' tomb ran with saffron. Phoedus, on his way back home, received the news that a daughter was born to him, and decided to name her Nicostrate (\\"Victorious Army\\").Plutarch, Amatoriae Narrationes, 4 Its site is located near modern Ypato/Syrtzi.

He is a TED Senior Fellow.  Education and early life  Sengeh was offered a scholarship to study in Norway, and joined the UWC Red Cross Nordic College in 2004. His uncle was a surgeon. He studied biomedical engineering at Harvard University. He researched aerosolised vaccines for tuberculosis and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 2010. During his time at Harvard University, he was cofounder of Lebone Solutions, a start-up that developed inexpensive batteries from microbial fuel cells. He was listed in the 2013 Wired magazine Smart List. Sengeh joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology for his postgraduate studies, working under the supervision of Hugh Herr. He was inspired to work on prosthetics because he grew up surrounded by victims of civil war. He used MRI to map amputee's limbs, then assessed where artificial materials could create pressure points, and used 3D printing to generate new sockets. His prototypes were tested by veterans and amputees from the Boston Marathon bombing. He was named as a TED fellow in 2014, delivering a talk entitled The sore problem of prosthetic limbs. He was selected as one of Forbes 30 Under 30 in 2014. He won the 2014 Lemelson‚ÄìMIT Prize for his innovations in healthcare. He was selected as one of Face2Face Africa's Young Africans Committed to Excellence. He completed his PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2016. After completing his PhD, Sengeh toured makerspaces in America talking about his work on prosthetics. During his PhD research, Sengeh founded the NGO Global Minimum Inc, a program that supports the Innovate Salone entrepreneurship program in Sierra Leone, Kenya and Cape Town. He wanted to change 'aid to Africa' to 'Made in Africa'. The \\"A De Mek Am\\" Innovate Salone program supports teams from secondary schools to develop solutions to local problems. It was created in collaboration with the MIT Media Lab and MIT Public Service Center and modelled on the MIT innovation competitions. Sengeh supported the winning student projects to travel to the United States, where they spoke at Maker Faire. He supported Kelvin Doe, a thirteen year old inventor who had never left a ten-mile radius of his house in Sierra Leone, to join the MIT Visiting Practitioner's Program. Sengeh became Kelvin Doe's mentor. He returned to the TED stage in 2015, speaking to Kate Krontiris about innovation and inspiration. He has spoken at the NextEinstein Forum.  Career  Sengeh was offered a position at IBM in Africa, working on data driven healthcare. He worked with IBM Research in Nairobi, as well as in their newest lab in Johannesburg, designing and developing healthcare technologies in Africa. There are fewer than 50 doctors for every hundred thousand citizens in Africa, so Sengeh is exploring the use of artificial intelligence. He worked with Waheeda Banu Saib from the University of KwaZulu-Natal. He partnered with Port Loko Health Management Team to design a web-based tool that allows districts to monitor Ebola. He writes for HuffPost. In May 2018 Sengeh joined the Office of the President of Sierra Leone, working as chief innovation officer. In 2019 he was named Minister of Education of Sierra Leone. He ensured that each child in the Pujehun District had access to a laptop. He spoke at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and was described as a trailblazer. He is a prolific musician.

Career Prior to her stroke at the end of 2014, she owned and operated multiple businesses, including Pioneer Credit Union, where she started her finance career as a branch manager. (Pioneer later merged with Capital Credit Union.) She continued her career in finance, including becoming a partner in her own mortgage company in 2006 during the housing crisis. She was a columnist for general business topics for a division of the USA Today Network from 2006 to 2011. Her focus was on real estate and lending during the period known as The Great Recession. She later started her consulting business, TITANIUM Business Development, Inc. and public speaking career. Georgia travelled the world, working with professionals about their unconscious minds, building self-confidence, and reducing anxiety. She was for a short while a member of Platinum Partners with Tony Robbins, the international business coach known for having his seminar attendees walk across fire. When interviewed about her stroke, Georgia credited her own lessons about how to utilize the strength of the unconscious mind to the unprecedented swift progress she made during the first 24 hours in the hospital.

CCS can be employed to achieve a number of goals regarding climate change mitigation, such as preventing average global temperature from reaching certain levels above the pre-industrial average. In December 2015, the Paris Agreement articulated a census to not exceed pre-industrial global temperatures by more than 2 ¬∞C and recognized that different countries would have different contributions to help realize this goal. Under the Paris Agreement, different scenarios and climate models were analyzed for different temperature goals considering a wide range of mitigation methods from a temperature goal of less than 2 ¬∞C to an upper limit of exactly 2 ¬∞C increase above the pre-industrial average. The terms CCS and CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage) are often used interchangeably. The difference between the two is the specified 'utilization' of the captured carbon and refers to its use for other applications, such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR), potentially making liquid fuel, or the manufacturing of useful consumer goods, such as plastics. Since both approaches capture emitted CO2 and effectively store it, whether that be under-ground in geological formations or long-term trapping in material products, the two terms are often treated the same. CCS is considered as a basis of one climate stabilization wedge, which is a proposed climate mitigation action to reduce approximately 1 billion tonnes of carbon emissions over 50 years.  CCS and different climate models  Carbon dioxide emissions and atmospheric concentrations over the 21st century Large scale CCS plays a crucial role in reaching climate change stabilization. According to the IPCC, the carbon emission patterns can greatly vary based on the uncertainty of human power consumption. A file regarding the fluctuations of greenhouse gas emissions is shown to the right. However, CCS‚Äô primarily role is to delay the shift from fossil fuels and thereby reducing transition costs. The implementation of default technology assumptions would cost 29-297% more over the century than efforts without CCS for a 430-480 ppm CO2/yr scenario. The Paris agreement upholds a goal to reach no more than a 2.0 ¬∞C increase above pre-industrial temperatures. If the 2.0 ¬∞C goal is to be reached in time, CCS must be utilized to achieve net zero emissions by 2060-2070. After 2060-2070, negative emissions will need to be achieved to remain below the 2.0 ¬∞C target. The variations in methods depend heavily on the climate change model being used and the anticipated energy consumption patterns. It is widely agreed upon, however, that CCS would need to be utilized if there is to be any negative climate change mitigation.  CCS and 2.0¬∞C target  The concept of a 2.0 ¬∞C came to light in the European Union of 1996 where the goal was to reduce the global temperature range relative pre-industrial levels. The decision of the 2 ¬∞C range was decided mostly on the evidence that many ecosystems are at risk if average global temperatures exceeded this limit. In order to limit the anthropogenic emissions such that there is no more than a 2 ¬∞C change relative to the periods between 1861-1880, carbon emissions would need to be limited to about 1000 GtC by 2100 since that period. However, by the end of 2011 about of half of the budget was already released (445 GtC) indicating that a lower budget is necessary. A distinctive path that aims for a 2.0 ¬∞C limit might have complications. The first complication involves the lack of positive feedback loops in IPCC climate models. These loops include reduction of ice sheet size, which would mean less sunlight is reflected and more is absorbed by the darker colored ground or water, and the potential release of greenhouse gases by thawing tundra. Since the lifetime of CO2 in the climate atmosphere is so long, these feedback loops have to be taken into consideration. Another important factor to consider is that a 2.0 ¬∞C scenario necessitates tapping into alternative fossil fuels sources that are harder to obtain. Some examples of these methods are the exploitation of tar sands, tar shales, hydrofracking for oil and gas, coal mining, drilling in the Arctic, Amazon, and deep ocean. Therefore, 2.0 ¬∞C scenarios result in more CO2 produced per unit of usable energy. Further, the danger of extra released CH4 via mining processes must be taken into account. Global greenhouse gas emissions by gas type Different models are based on when the peak of carbon emissions happen on a global scale. In one article regarding the 2.0 ¬∞C scenario with respect to pre-industrial levels, possible approaches are short term and long term emission resolutions as well as the considering the cost effectiveness of different solutions to reduce carbon emissions. Short term goals are set to quantify progress towards the temperature goal. In a short term goal, looking ahead to the year 2020, the allowable carbon emissions must be between 41 and 55 GtCO2 per year. The short term 2 ¬∞C scenario is not feasible without CCS. Currently, greenhouse gas emissions would need to be reduced by 7 Gt of carbon equivalent each year by 2050 to achieve 2 ¬∞C stabilization. This requires power generation with CCS at 800 coal-fired power plants of 1 GW energy generation capacity, 180 coal-synfuel plants, or natural gas plants worth 1,600 GW. In this scenario, one of the wedges, or 1 Gt of carbon is accounted for by CCUS. The cost of capturing CO2 is estimated to be $500/tC. If the goal with the 2.0 ¬∞C is to store a total of 7 Gt carbon per year, then the collective amount needed to achieve this is around 3.5 trillion U.S. dollars per year. The economic demand needed to achieve this goal is high. This amount of money is equivalent to gross national incomes for countries such as Russia or United Kingdom, and it represents 18% of United States' 2017 gross national income (19.61 trillion dollars).  CCS and below 2.0¬∞C target   Achieving below 2.0¬∞C target  A change of temperature below 2 ¬∞C is, to certain extent, almost impossible to achieve due to the current carbon emission practices. The IPCC notes that it is difficult to assess a climate mitigation scenario that would limit average global temperature increase to only 1.5 ¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. This is mainly due to the fact that few reliable multi-model studies have been conducted to thoroughly explore this scenario. Nevertheless, what few studies that have been done agree that mitigation technologies must be implemented immediately and scaled up quickly and reflect energy demand decrease. A change below 1 ¬∞C with respect to pre-industrial era is now inconceivable because by 2017 there was already an increase of 1 ¬∞C.M. R. Allen, O. P. Dube, W. Solecki, F. Arag√≥n‚ÄìDurand, W.

An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty [V. Masson-Delmotte, P. Zhai, H. O. P√∂rtner, D. Roberts, J. Skea, P.R. Shukla, A. Pirani, W. Moufouma-Okia, C. P√©an, R. Pidcock, S. Connors, J. B. R. Matthews, Y. Chen, X. Zhou, M. I. Gomis, E. Lonnoy, T. Maycock, M. Tignor, T. Waterfield (eds.)]. In Press. Because of the immediate inability to control the temperature at the 1 ¬∞C target, the next realistic target is 1.5 ¬∞C. There is enough confidence that past emissions alone (pre- industrial time) will not be enough to go beyond the 1.5 ¬∞C target. In other words, if all anthropogenic emissions were stopped today (reduced to zero), any increase beyond the 1 ¬∞C change for more than half of a degree before 2100 is unlikely. If anthropogenic emission are considered, the probability for the planet increasing for more than 1.5 ¬∞C before 2100 are high. Then, scenarios where the degree change is maintain below 1.5 ¬∞C are very challenging to achieve but not impossible. For a below 2.0 ¬∞C target, Shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) had been developed adding a socio-economic dimension to the integrative work started by RCPs models. The advantage of using SSPs is that they incorporate social standards, fossil fuel use, geographical development, and high energy demand. SSPs also incorporate the use of six other models such as GCAM4, IMAGE, MESSAGE-GLOBIOM, and REMIND-MAgPIE. The combination of models and scenarios concluded that by 2050, annual CO2 emissions are in the range between 9 and 13 billion tons of CO2. All of the scenarios estimated that temperature will remain below 2.0 ¬∞C change with a 66% probability of success. To do so, a 1.9 W/m2 within the year 2100 is necessary. Net zero GHG emissions have to be achieved between 2055-2075, and CO2 emissions have to be in a range between 175 and 475 GtCO2 between the years 2016-2100. All SSPs scenarios show a shift away from unabated fossil fuels, that is process without CCS.  Assumptions for below 2.0¬∞C target  To achieve a 1.5 ¬∞C target before 2100, the following assumptions have to be considered; emissions have to peak by 2020 and decline after that, it will be necessary to reduce net CO2 emissions to zero and negative emissions have to be a reality by the second half of the 21st century. For this assumptions to take place, CCS has to be implemented in factories that accompany the use of fossil fuels. Because emissions reduction has to be implemented more rigorously for a 1.5 ¬∞C target, methods such as BEECS, and natural climate solutions such as afforestation can be used to aim in the reduction of global emissions. BECCS is necessary to achieve a 1.5 ¬∞C. It is estimated by the models that with the help of BECCS, between 150-12000 GtCO2 still have to be removed from the atmosphere. Another negative emission strategy which includes CCS can also be approached through DACCS. Direct Air Carbon Capture and Sequestration (DACCS) is a carbon negative technology that utilizes solid amine based capture and it has proven to capture carbon dioxide from the air even though content of the air is much lower than of a flue gas from a coal plant. However, it would require renewable energies to power since approximately 400kJ of work is needed per mole of CO2 capture. Furthermore, it is estimated that the total system cost is $1,000 per tonne of CO2, according to an economic and energetic analysis from 2011. Going forward in the utilization of models such as SSPss and RCP, feasibility of the model has to be to take into consideration. Feasibility includes concerns in various fields, such as geophysics, technology, economics, social acceptance, and politics, all of which can serve to facilitate or obstruct the carbon capture and sequestration of emissions needed in order to achieve the global temperature targets. Uncertainty in feasibility is especially a problem with more strict temperatures limits such as 1.5 ¬∞C. Real world feasibility of SSPs models, or any other models, in general are coarse approximations of reality.

The battle, which took place a week after the Athenian victory at Rhium, set an Athenian fleet of twenty ships, commanded by Phormio, against a Peloponnesian fleet of seventy-seven ships, commanded by Cnemus. Cnemus (Greek: ŒöŒΩ·øÜŒºŒøœÇ) was the Spartan fleet commander during the second and third years (430/29 BC) of the Archidamian War. During his command, Cnemus oversaw a series of operations that met with failure. As a result, the Spartans began to question Cnemus' leadership and sent several advisers to assist him in his command.  Military Service   Zacynthian Campaign  Cnemus' earliest recorded military operation during the Archidamian War occurred in the summer of 430 BC, at the island of Zacynthus. Because Zacynthus was populated by Achaeans who had allied themselves with Athens, Cnemus led an expedition, made up of Spartans and their allies, against the island. The expeditionary force consisted of 100 ships, carrying a total of 1000 Spartan hoplites. Although Cnemus' forces destroyed much of Zacynthus, when they realized that the island's population would refuse to surrender, the expeditionary force returned home, having achieved little.  Acarnanian Campaign  The summer following the Zacynthian Campaign (429 BC), Cnemus led an expedition against Acarnania. Two of Sparta's allies, the Ambraciots and Chaonians, had convinced the Spartans to invade Acarnania with the purpose of eventually capturing the islands of Cephallenia and Zacynthus. As the Ambraciots and Chaonians argued, if the campaign succeeded, the Spartans would gain strategic positions, thus enabling them to complicate the Athenians' navigation around the Peloponnesus. As a result of these urgings, the Spartans decided to send a land force, led by Cnemus, to the Ambracian Gulf to prepare for the invasion of Acarnania. At the same time, Spartan allies including Corinth, Sicyon, Leucas, Anactorium, and Ambracia prepared to send a fleet to limit the coastal Acarnanians' ability to move against the Spartan land force in the Acarnanian interior. Cnemus' land force consisted of both Hellenes and barbarians. The Hellenic forces included 1000 Spartan hoplites, as well as Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Anactorians. In addition to 1000 Chaonians, the barbarian forces included Thesprotians and Molossians, among others. Upon the land force‚Äôs arrival in the Ambracian Gulf, rather than waiting for the allied fleet to arrive as well, Cnemus began advancing his troops towards the Acarnanian capital of Stratus, destroying the Amphilochian village of Limnaea along the way. Cnemus believed that with the conquest of Stratus, the rest of Acarnania would quickly fall under Spartan control. As the land force approached Stratus, Cnemus divided his troops into three divisions. The left division was constituted of Spartans and Ambraciots, with Cnemus himself leading. The center division contained Chaonians and other barbarians. The right division was made up of Leucadians and Anactorians. Cnemus‚Äô plan was that the three divisions would encamp outside Stratus and would regroup to attack the city‚Äôs walls if negotiations with the Stratians failed. However, as the left and right divisions (the Hellenic divisions) found suitable positions and began to encamp, the center division, led by the Chaonians, continued to advance. Without making Cnemus or the other divisions aware of their intentions, the center division sought to capture Stratus alone because, according to the historian Thucydides, they hoped to secure all the glory of the battle for themselves. Seeing the center division's advance, the Stratians entrenched themselves and prepared ambushes throughout the city. Upon its arrival, the center division was engaged by the Stratians in close combat. Caught by surprise, the center division was routed and fled back to Cnemus‚Äô camp. The encamped divisions, only realizing what had happened as the center division fled into their midst, formed ranks and held their position for the rest of the day. The Stratians, lacking reinforcements, did not engage Cnemus‚Äô land force further. That night, Cnemus moved his forces away from Stratus. The next day, knowing that Acarnanian reinforcements were coming from the coast, he retreated to the allied city of Oeniadae. From Oeniadae, the land force disbanded, each group returning to its native country. At the same time as the battle at Stratus, the fleet that was supposed to support Cnemus was drawn into battle at Naupactus by the Athenian admiral Phormio. Not having expected to engage in a sea battle, the Spartan fleet consisted primarily of ships suited only for transporting troops rather than for fighting. This, along with the fact that Phormio‚Äôs men were more experienced in naval warfare than the Spartans, gave Phormio the confidence to attack the Spartans‚Äô forty- seven ships with his twenty. Taking advantage of the Spartan fleet‚Äôs inexperience, Phormio developed a strategy to create confusion among the Spartan ships and was thus able to rout their forces, capturing twelve enemy ships by the end of the battle. The surviving Spartan ships sailed to Cyllene, where they regrouped with Cnemus.  Aftermath of the Acarnanian Campaign  Upon receiving news of the failure of the Acarnanian Campaign, the Spartans became greatly dissatisfied with Cnemus‚Äô command of the fleet. Although Cnemus was not present at the Spartan naval force‚Äôs defeat at Naupactus, himself being engaged at the time in Stratus, because he was the commander for the entire expedition, the Spartans held Cnemus responsible. As a result, three commissioners, Timocrates, Brasidas, and Lycophron, were sent by the Spartans to make up for what they perceived as Cnemus‚Äô lack of energy and to help him reorganize the fleet. The Spartans, for their part, were unwilling to concede that the smaller Athenian naval force had defeated the Spartan fleet at Naupactus because of their greater experience at sea.  Second Naval Battle at Naupactus  With the arrival of the three Spartan commissioners at Cyllene, Phormio began to prepare his ships for a second naval battle. Cnemus now had seventy-seven ships under his command and set anchor at Achaean Rhium. Phormio, with the same twenty ships from his victory at Naupactus, set anchor at Molycrian Rhium, directly across the Spartans at the mouth of the Crisaean Gulf. Aware that Phormio had sent to Athens for reinforcements, Cnemus and the other Spartan commanders sought to engage the Athenians as soon as possible. They also desired to wage the battle between the Rhia, so that the Athenians would be unable to employ the same strategy they had used at the first battle of Naupactus. Seeing that the Spartan troops were afraid of the prospect of battle, however, Cnemus and the Spartan commanders had to give a speech of encouragement to their troops before they could begin the engagement. The speech largely consisted of extolling the Spartans‚Äô native valor and their superiority of numbers, as well as blaming the previous defeat at Naupactus on bad luck and the Spartans‚Äô lack of naval experience. Because Cnemus and the Spartan commanders desired to wage the battle in the narrows between the Rhia, they ordered their ships to sail towards Corinth in the hope that Phormio would interpret their departure as a move to attack the now-unguarded Naupactus and would follow them into the narrows. It is not clear whether this was Cnemus‚Äô plan or the plan of one of his advisers; nonetheless, Cnemus was responsible for agreeing to implement the plan. Phormio, taking the Spartans‚Äô bait, ordered his ships to sail along the shore, in single file, towards Naupactus. Taking advantage of the Athenians‚Äô exposed position, the Spartans quickly turned their formation, hoping to cut the Athenians off before they reached Naupactus. Eleven of the Athenian ships escaped the Spartans‚Äô maneuver; nine ships were disabled by the Spartans. With the destruction of nearly half the Athenian fleet, the Spartan strategy seemed to be a success. The eleven remaining Athenian ships fled to Naupactus, pursued by twenty Spartan ships. Ten of the Athenian ships made it to the shore of Naupactus and positioned themselves so as to repel an attack, should the Spartans pursue them further. However, one Athenian ship remained in open water and was being closely pursued by a single Spartan ship. Suddenly turning around, the Athenian ship sank its pursuer. The rest of the pursuing Spartans, having become careless in their premature sense of victory and surprised by the sight of one of their own ships sunk by an enemy that had ostensibly been retreating, were suddenly overcome by a sense of panic. The Spartans quickly halted their pursuit and, as a consequence of their lack of familiarity with the local geography, ran several of their ships aground. Taking advantage of the chaos among the Spartans, the Athenians launched an attack in which they captured six Spartan ships and recovered the nine ships they had lost earlier. The Spartans proceeded to retreat to Panormus. Among the Spartan dead was Cnemus‚Äô advisor, Timocrates, who, having been on board the first Spartan ship to be sunk, killed himself out of shame. Although both sides later claimed victory, the Spartans, concerned about immanent Athenian reinforcement, retreated to Corinth. Some scholars claim that Thucydides implies in his History of the Peloponnesian War that Cnemus made the decision to abort the Megarian plan.  Plot to Capture the Piraeus  After arriving in Corinth, Cnemus and Brasidas allowed the Megarians to convince them to launch an attack on Athens‚Äô port, the Piraeus. Although the blame for the Spartans‚Äô second defeat at Naupactus lay primarily on the inexperience of their sailors, Cnemus‚Äô willingness to retreat to Corinth rather than re-engage the Athenians cemented the Spartans‚Äô perception that he was lacking in energy as a leader. Therefore, although it is not explicitly known why Cnemus and Brasidas agreed to the Megarian plan, some scholars have speculated that neither man was eager to return to Sparta without having gained at least one victory. Crossing from Corinth to Megara, the Spartans planned to launch forty ships and take the Athenians by surprise. The Athenians, aware of their naval superiority, never expected an open naval attack against the Piraeus. As a result, there was no fleet positioned to defend the port. Although the execution of the Megarian plan initially seemed to go well, on the night that the Spartans began to sail to the Piraeus, they became afraid of the risk involved and altered their plan to the less ambitious goal of attacking the Athenian fort on Salamis. Although it is unknown who was responsible for the decision to abort the plan of attacking the Piraeus, certain scholars claim that Thucydides, in his History of the Peloponnesian War, implies Cnemus was responsible. When the Spartans attacked, they took the Athenians by surprise, capturing three Athenian ships and wreaking damage throughout the island. However, the Salaminians were able to send a signal to Athens, notifying them of the attack. The Athenians, thinking that the Spartans were either already attacking the Piraeus or just about to attack, fell into a panic. The following day, the Athenians mustered a ground force to bolster the defenses of the Piraeus and launched their fleet to defend Salamis. The Spartans, becoming aware of this, fled back to Megara. As a result of this incident, the Athenians developed a number of measures to better guard the Piraeus in the future. However, Cnemus and Brasidas had finally achieved a victory that allowed them to return to Sparta without disgrace.  Cnemus in the History of the Peloponnesian War According to H.D. Westlake, Cnemus was characterized by Thucydides in the History of the Peloponnesian War as a prototypical Spartan military leader in order to draw the general lesson of the inadequacy of conventional Spartan leadership. In Thucydides' characterization, Cnemus' similarities to the later Spartan fleet commander, Alcidas, may have been exaggerated to contrast and emphasize the superior leadership of the heterodox Brasidas. Thus, as Westlake argues, Cnemus may have been unfairly represented by Thucydides as largely responsible for Spartans' various military failures.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Sarbach, to the northwest, with Epaulette Mountain immediately to the southeast. Kaufmann Peaks is situated south of Saskatchewan Crossing, where the Icefields Parkway intersects with the David Thompson Highway. History The South Peak (3,110 m) is named for Hans Kaufmann (1874-1930), the younger of two Swiss brothers who were popular mountain guides. Christian and HansHans Kaufmann completed twelve first ascents in the Rockies during the years 1901 to 1904. The North Peak (3,094 m) honors Christian Kaufmann (1872-1939) who completed 36 first ascents in the Canadian Rockies by making fifteen of those in 1901 and ten more in 1902. The two were half-brothers to Peter Kaufmann. The first ascent of Kaufmann Peaks was made in 1927 by D. Duncan, and guide Ernest Feuz. Recommended by James Outram in 1903, the mountain's name was officially adopted in 1920 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Kaufmann Peaks is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. A glacier shared with Mount Sarbach resides in the northeast cirque.

History The LBSCR had served Epsom since 1847, from via and (the Croydon and Epsom Railway), with ambitions to extend further west. But the LSWR wanted a share of the lucrative race traffic, and to this end it supported a proposed Wimbledon and Dorking Railway (WDR), connecting the named towns via Epsom. Before that scheme could be approved, in 1857 the ELR was incorporated, pre-empting the central part of the WDR route. The ELR opened on 1 February 1859, initially consisting of an isolated single-track line from to with an intermediate station at . Epsom and Leatherhead junctions, with separate LBSCR and LSWR stations in both towns When the truncated WDR opened on 4 April 1859 it connected end-on to the ELR at their Epsom station. Later in 1859 the LBSCR connected to the ELR by extending from their existing Epsom terminus, which was renamed \\"Epsom Town\\". Although the junction was at the ELR station the LBSCR did not have access to the platforms, which were used exclusively by LSWR services. A year after opening the ELR was acquired by the LSWR but operated by a Joint Committee of the LSWR and LBSCR. In 1863 the company was vested jointly in the LSWR and LBSCR by Act of Parliament. They shared the stations at Ashtead and Leatherhead, but maintained separate stations at Epsom until they were both absorbed into the Southern Railway at the Grouping. The route was eventually completed in 1867 by the LBSCR-promoted Horsham, Dorking and Leatherhead Railway, continuing to on the Mid-Sussex Line. The LBSCR built its own Leatherhead station, leaving the original ELR station as a terminus for LSWR services. The LSWR Leatherhead station was later connected to the New Guildford Line via the Bookham branch, becoming a through station on the route to . As at Epsom, both stations continued in use until the Grouping.

It was founded by Abraham Golan, a Hungarian-Israeli security contractor. The company was approached by a representative of the United Arab Emirates government to carry out assassinations in Yemen as part of the Yemeni Civil War (2015‚Äìpresent), which may be a violation of the War Crimes Act of 1996. In 2015, the company embedded a team of US special forces veterans and former members of the French Foreign Legion within the Emirati military, which supplied the team with weapons, uniforms, Emirati military ranks, and dog tags. By 2016, Spear Operations Group had replaced the Legionnaires with Americans. On 29 December 2015, Spear Operations Group began its operations in Yemen with a failed assassination attempt on Anssaf Ali Mayo, the local leader of Islamist political party Al-Islah. Though the first operation failed, the team stayed on in Yemen for several more months and claimed credit for a number of other high-profile assassinations. Their targets included other members of al-Islah, nonviolent clerics, and some \\"out and out terrorists.\\" After Spear Operations Group's assassinations were made public by an October 2018 BuzzFeed News report, US Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bob Menendez wrote letters to the State Department demanding answers about Spear Operations Group, focusing on whether the federal government knew about their involvement in the war in Yemen.

The two confirmed graves were excavated in 1935 and re-excavated in 2014. The first grave, dubbed Cairn 1, contained grave goods consistent with a high-status metalworker. These included two of the earliest gold ornaments, and one of the earliest bell beakers, known in Britain. The second grave was empty.  Excavation  One of the gold ornaments The Kirkhaugh cairns were excavated over five days in 1935 by Herbert Maryon, then master of sculpture at Durham University's Armstrong College. Maryon was interested in archaeology, frequently carrying out excavations with his students; in a second career, after retiring from Armstrong, he was hired by the British Museum to conserve the objects from the Anglo-Saxon Sutton Hoo ship-burial. At Kirkhaugh Maryon was assisted by Joseph William Alderson, carrying out the excavation on 18‚Äì21 September, and on 12 October. Upon removal of the turf from the first mound, Maryon found what he described as \\"a continuous layer of flattish stones\\" underneath. These were piled on top of each other, and varied in size from several inches in length to two feet; the larger stones weighed between 50 and 100 pounds. Beneath the stones was a mixture of light earth and small stones. No body was found, but near the centre of the cairn, where a body might have been placed, were patches of greasy clay on the rock surface. Also in the centre were found the majority of the grave goods. Maryon described these as a crushed food vessel; \\"1 gold ear- ring\\"; \\"1 flint arrowhead\\"; \\"1 flint saw\\"; \\"6 worked flakes of flint\\" ; \\"2 flint cores, and a number of unworked flakes\\"; \\"1 whetstone, or hone\\"; \\"1 coarse rubber of sandstone\\"; \\"1 rough nodule of glazed ware\\"; \\"1 vase or mug handle\\"; and \\"a fragment of coarse pottery, a nodule of iron pyrites, and some pieces of charcoal.\\" With the exception of the food vessel, found about four and a half feet from the centre, and some of the charcoal, all of the finds were in the central area about three or four feet in diameter. The crushed food vessel identified by Maryon has subsequently been termed a bell beaker, and as one of, or perhaps the, earliest type yet found in Britain. What Maryon termed an earring has also been re-identified, as a hair braid; it is one of the oldest metal objects found in the country. In 2014, during a re-excavation of the cairns using community volunteers, four boys‚Äîtwo of whom were great- grandsons of Alderson‚Äîdiscovered a matching hair braid.

She was born and raised in the traditions of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. She was raised in an intellectual family that encouraged the practice of traditional calligraphy and painting. Kuan's family was also the conduit to her finding catholicism because they would bring her and her siblings to catholic missionary hospitals if they were sick and sent them to catholic school. Kuan admired the nuns and their free will to enter monastic life and so in 1948, Neihan Kuan left China and went to Taiwan where she met the Benedictine Sisters, entered the monastery, and became Baulu Kuan, OSB. Later in the 1950s she moved to the Saint Benedict's Monastery in St. Joseph, Minnesota where she currently resides. Art work  In her undergraduate schooling at the College of St. Benedict, Kuan pursued a double major in art and literature and a minor in education. She worked closely under her mentor, colleague, and friend, Sister Thomas Carey, who largely influenced Kuan's art. Later she completed her master's thesis in painting in June 1968 at the University of Iowa with the piece, Interior Portrait. She worked in the many artistic styles that took hold in popularity throughout her life: fauvism, cubism, and abstract expressionism. She also made many traditional Chinese ink drawings and woodblock prints. Her work interacts with her unique background as a Chinese-American Catholic nun, containing many elements Eastern aesthetics with Western biblical themes. Teaching  In Minnesota, Kuan taught high school students in St. Cloud and Cold Spring. Later after pursuing her masters, she taught Studio Art and Art History for 34 years at the College of St. Benedict. She did much of her scholarship and study on non-western art under the guidance of Sister Mary David Olheiser, Dean, with the goal of establishing more courses in non-western areas. She also received numerous grants and fellowships from Harvard, Yale, and Santa Barbara, allowing her to travel and take students on study trips to learn about art and culture around the globe including Mesoamerica, New Guinea, West Africa, China, Tibet, and Europe. In the 1980s when China re-opened its borders to travel, Kuan led her first of many archaeology trips there. Through study and teaching abroad in China, Kuan forged the strong relationship between Southwest University in China and the College of St. Benedict and St. Johns University, which remains today. In February 1997, Kuan attended the College Art Association (CAA) Conference in New York which was exploring issues in non-western art. Some of the topics on discussion that year were: \\"The Problematics of East and West,\\" \\"Making Asian Art History: Principles of Comparison Between Chinese and Western Painting,\\" and \\"Modern or Chinese: Revival of Tradition at the Age of Modernism.\\"  Collecting  While on her travels and study abroad trips, Baulu Kuan collected many artifacts around the world. In 1971 in the West African nations of Senegal, Gabon, Benin, Togo, Nigeria, and the Ivory Coast she collected masks, textiles, jewelry, and statues. In 1973 Baulu Kuan and Caprician Weaver, OSB traveled to New Guinea to study the area's art and anthropology. Here they traversed the land via many traditional and local modes of transportation like tree-hollowed boats, thatched stretchers, outrigger canoes, bush plane, and by foot. Here they collected grass skirts, masks, and various wood carvings. Baulu Kuan has also collected art and artifacts from China, West Africa, and Mesoamerica while leading study abroad trips and teaching abroad. These collected artifacts are kept in the permanent collection at the College of St. Benedict and the Benedictine Monastery.  Curating  Baulu Kuan OSB has also curated exhibitions and published art books throughout her life. Baulu Kuan and Nancy Hynes wrote the book Sister Thomas Carey, O.S.B. : the Light Within published in 2003 which presents collected writings about and imagery of the art of Sister Thomas Carey O.S.B. Kuan presented her own show, A Lifetime Pursuit: Journeying into the art of Baulu Kuan, OSB, in the Heahn Museum Gallery at the College of St. Benedict Monastery from April 30, 2017 to December 23, 2017. This show was a retrospective of her own art, her students' art, works of art and artifacts she collected during her travels, and photographs she took on these trips. Later that year she curated the show, A Lifetime Pursuit Continues presented in the Gorecki Gallery and Gallery Lounge at the College of St. Benedict from November 6, 2017 to January 7, 2018. This show featured art by former colleagues and students, some of whom are internationally known, and also a few of her own works as well. These works ranged from ink drawings, scrolls, traditional woodblock prints, paintings, and sculptural works. Also included in the show was a collection of traditional Chinese art tools such as brushes and stamps and their cases.

Being a ground weta, they are often found in burrows in the ground during the daytime (as they are also nocturnal). The species is occurs on the South Island and is classified as \\"not threatened\\". This species of wƒìtƒÅ is unusual for an insect in that the female looks after her eggs and nymphs, this is known as maternal care.  Taxonomy  Hemiandrus maia was first described in 2013, but had been referred to in previous publications by an informal (tag) name (Hemiandrus 'evansae'). The species name comes from the Greek name Maia, the eldest of the Pleiades (in Greek mythology the seven daughters of Pleione and Atlas), meaning ‚Äòmother‚Äô or ‚Äògood mother‚Äô. This name is given to this species to reflect the maternal care exhibited.  Habitat/Distribution  Hemiandrus maia are endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. Because they are a ground weta, they are often found in burrows in the ground during the day, as they are a nocturnal species. During the night however, they are quite active on the ground, but are also found in vegetation.  Conservation  The New Zealand Department of Conservation classified this species as \\"not threatened\\" in 2014.  Diet  Hemiandrus maia is omnivorous, eating fruit and invertebrates but avoiding seeds of native plants.  Morphology  Otago ground wƒìtƒÅ females have a medium-length ovipositor. Male and females have fore tibiae with a single superior prolateral spine (excluding apical spine) and mid tibiae with two superior prolateral spines and three superior retrolateral spines (excluding apical spines).  Behavior  Hemiandrus maia come out of their burrows on average once every three nights. The females share burrows and care for eggs and nymphs.

It was introduced on June 15, 1976, to replace the lightly-used Charlottesville- Newport News section of the James Whitcomb Riley. Certain trips were known as the Senator and Tidewater beginning in the late 1970s. The Richmond-New York City Virginian was added in 1984, with some trips called Potomac from 1985 to 1988. The Colonial was renamed Old Dominion on October 24, 1992, as part of a series of service changes. Several name changes of Virginia service over the next three years created the Chesapeake, Gotham Limited, James River, New England Express, Tidewater Express, and Manhattan Express, and added a second Richmond trip. Virginia service was merged into the NortheastDirect brand in 1995. A second daily round trip was added as the Twilight Shoreliner in 1997. After subsequent service changes, Amtrak service to Newport News continues as part of the Northeast Regional brand. History Previous service The George Washington at Newport News in 1968 By the time Amtrak took over intercity passenger service in the United States on May 1, 1971, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) served Newport News with three daily round trips: the Charlottesville‚ÄìNewport News sections of the George Washington and Fast Flying Virginian / Sportsman, plus a Newport News‚ÄìRichmond trip. Amtrak kept only one daily round trip to Newport News‚Äîa section of the Washington‚ÄìCincinnati George Washington. The George Washington was combined with the James Whitcomb Riley on July 12, 1971, to provide through service to Chicago. The Newport News section was lightly used‚Äîusually not filling a single coach‚Äîand passengers between the Tidewater region and the Northeast had to transfer at Charlottesville. The March 25, 1975, introduction of the Chicago‚ÄìNorfolk Mountaineer satisfied a federal mandate for Amtrak to provide service between Cincinnati and the Tidewater. Following studies that indicated a market for direct service between the Tidewater and the Northeast, Amtrak replaced the Riley section with the New York City-Newport News Colonial on June 15, 1976. The Colonial served as an extension of the southbound Mount Vernon (which was already called Colonial on Saturdays) and the northbound Betsy Ross. It used new Amfleet coaches, unlike the aging ex-C&O; passenger cars used on the Riley. Service changes The Tidewater at Newport News in 1978 Initially, the Colonial ran between Newport News and New York City, except for the Saturday southbound train which originated in Boston. On February 15, 1977, all Colonial service was extended to Boston. Northbound Sunday service changed on May 1, 1977: the Colonial began to originate at Richmond, while the several-hours-later Senator originated at Newport News. A stop at Lee Hall was added on October 30, 1977. Beginning on July 30, 1978, northbound Sunday service became the Newport News-New York City Tidewater, and the Senator returned to its previous schedule. On January 4, 1987, the northbound Colonial collided with Conrail locomotives in Maryland, killing fourteen passengers and two Amtrak employees. By the early 1980s, Richmond was served by the Colonial/Tidewater plus three long-distance trains‚Äîthe Palmetto, Silver Meteor, and Silver Star. Because the long-distance trains frequently ran late, only the Colonial/Tidewater provided reliable northbound service from Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Quantico. On October 28, 1984, Amtrak added the daily Richmond-New York Virginian, which was timed to allow commuting to Washington. On April 28, 1985, the northbound Sunday Virginian was moved two hours later as the Potomac. The Potomac was discontinued on September 15, 1988; the Colonial began running from Richmond to Boston on Sundays, with the Tidewater continuing to provide Sunday northbound service from Newport News. The April 1990 extension of one Atlantic City Express train to Richmond and the April 1991 separation of the New York‚ÄìCharlotte Carolinian from the Palmetto increased Washington-Richmond service to seven daily round trips. Later service A Regional at Williamsburg in 2008 Amtrak made a series of changes to corridor service in Virginia beginning on 1992. On October 25, 1992, both the Virginian and Colonial were cut back from Boston to New York City, and the latter was renamed Old Dominion. A Friday Tidewater round trip was also added. May 2, 1993 saw the additional of Tidewater round trips on Thursday and Saturday southbound / Sunday northbound, plus a southbound-only Sunday trip from Richmond to Newport News. A station stop was added at Williamsburg Pottery Factory. Service levels of the added weekend round trips were adjusted the next February. The southbound weekend Virginian became the Chesapeake on May 1, 1994, with the northbound weekend Old Dominion in turn renamed Virginian. On October 30, 1994, the Sunday Richmond-Newport News trip and a late Friday Newport News-Richmond move (a former deadhead move) were called the James River. Amtrak began showing Virginia services as part of Northeast Corridor timetables on April 2, 1995. The Old Dominion and Virginian were renamed New England Express and the Lee Hall stop was dropped. A daily Richmond-New York City round trip‚Äîthe southbound Chesapeake made daily and a new northbound Old Dominion‚Äîwas added to replace the discontinued Amtrak City Express. On September 10, 1995, the northbound New England Express was renamed Tidewater Express (except for a single Sunday trip from Springfield, which became the Old Dominion), and the northbound Old Dominion was replaced with the Manhattan Express. On October 28, 1995, most of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor services (except for the premium Metroliners and commuter-based Clockers), including the Richmond and Newport News trains, were rebranded as NortheastDirect and lost their individual names. Train names were re-added under the NortheastDirect brand the next year. The daily Newport News train became the Old Dominion, with Tidewater, Virginian, James River, and Potomac assigned to other trips. The daily Richmond trains became the Virginian and the Bay State, the latter of which ran to Boston via Springfield and the Inland Route. The Williamsburg Pottery Factory stop was also discontinued in 1996. On July 10, 1997, the Washington-Boston Night Owl was replaced by the Newport News-Boston Twilight Shoreliner, providing a second daily round trip to Newport News. The Bay State was cut back to Washington and replaced by the Springfield-Richmond Charter Oak, and the Potomac was renamed Gotham Limited. On October 26, 1997, the Chesapeake was cut to New York and renamed Colonial. NortheastDirect trains except for the Twilight Shoreliner again lost their individual names on May 16, 1999. The NortheastDirect brand‚Äîincluding the Virginia trains‚Äîwas renamed Acela Regional in 2000-2001, Regional in 2003, and finally Northeast Regional in 2008. Virginia began funding further expansion of Northeast Regional service in 2009.

Her research helped expand the microbiology field, primarily focused on pathogenicity and decomposition at the time, to include positive microbial associations. She currently is a professor at PBRC‚Äôs Kewalo Marine Laboratory and director of the Pacific Biosciences Research Program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  Education and Career  McFall-Ngai spent her childhood in Southern California and attended Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles. She attended college at the University of San Francisco, graduating in 1973 with a Bachelors of Science in biology. She chose to further her education at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with doctoral advisor, James Morin, studying functional morphology and comparative physiology while working as a teaching assistant/fellow. Her graduate research took her to the central Philippines to study the relationship between bioluminescent bacteria found in the leiognathid light organ in fish, igniting her ‚Äúlifelong interest‚Äù in the blend of the two subjects. McFall-Ngai graduated with her Ph.D. in Biology in 1983 and went on to complete two postdoctoral fellowships. For her first postdoc, she remained at UCLA working on protein biochemistry-biophysics for the Jules Stein Eye Institute with advisor, Joseph Horwitz. She then moved to San Diego to work with advisor George Somero on protein chemistry enzymology at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. On the side McFall-Ngai had been exploring the Hawaiian bobtail squid as an alternative to the fish she had studied in graduate school and initiated what would become a career-long collaboration with microbiologist, Edward (Ned) Ruby, who had written his dissertation on the squids‚Äô symbionts, Vibrio fischeri. In 1989 McFall-Ngai accepted a position and later received tenure at the University of Southern California in the Department of Biology and began breeding and studying the Hawaiian bobtail squid. She and Ruby moved to Hawaii in 1996 to better study the squid-bacteria relationship, both accepting positions at Pacific Biomedical Research Center at the University of Hawaii. In 2004, McFall-Ngai accepted a position as professor in the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and the Eye Research institute. She returned to Hawaii in 2015 when she accepted her current position as director of the Pacific Biosciences Research Program and professor at PBRC‚Äôs Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

She initially began her research in graduate school studying fish with a similar bioluminescent bacterial relationship, however, these fish proved difficult to grow in the lab. At a meeting, a visiting researcher from the University of Hawaii suggested she investigate the Hawaiian bobtail squid and its bioluminescent symbionts V. fischeri as an alternative. McFall-Ngai found that the squid worked great in the lab with 8-10 pairs of squid generating roughly 60,000 juveniles a year. To fully study this relationship, McFall-Ngai began collaborating with Edward (Ned) Ruby, a microbiologist who had written his dissertation on V. fischeri. Over the next three decades, McFall-Ngai, Ruby, and dozens of postdocs and students would investigate all aspects of the symbiotic relationship. They worked to understand the development of the relationship at different stages of the squid life cycle, analyze the initiation of symbiosis in real time, and identify how the host selects its symbionts. They learned that the squid follows a rhythmic pattern in which the bacteria are brightest when the squid hunt at night and are then expelled at dawn. As analysis tools advanced, Ruby and McFall-Ngai were able to map transcriptional patterns and identify related genes that control the squid's rhythmic behaviors and symbiotic relationship. The sum of their Hawaiian bobtail squid research is an extremely well defined model organism fit for studying bacterial symbioses, light interacting tissues, and cephelopod development.

The focal point of the M√°scara vs. Caballera series of shows is one or more traditional Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet matches\\", where all competitors in the match risk their hair on the outcome of the match. The Lucha de Apuestas is considered the most prestigious match type in lucha libre, especially when a wrestlers mask is on the line, but the \\"hair vs. hair\\" stipulation is held in almost as high regard. In the main event of the show Golden Magic successfully defended his wrestling mask against Pirata Morgan Jr. in a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet match\\". As a result, the maskless Pirata Morgan Jr. had all his hair shaved off. Earlier in the show Negro Navarro joined Los Consagrados, even attacking his own son Trauma I in the progress. The show included five additional matches. Background In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so- called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. By the same token a wrestler betting his hair in a Lucha de Apuestas is seen as highly prestigious, usually a step below the mask match. Event The event featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. In the fifth match of the night, former tag team partners Danny Casas and Veneno, faced off in a Singles match, that was won by Casas. After the match, both sides made challenges for a future Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match, although no date was set for this match. For the sixth match of the night Herodes Jr. was injured during the match, leaving his partners M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. and Mr. Electro at a disadvantage against Negro Navarro, Pirata Morgan and Villano IV, collectively known as \\"Los Consagrados\\" (\\"The Devoted Ones\\"). Near the end of the match Black Terry came to ringside, looking like he was going to take Herodes Jr.'s place in the match, but instead fought Mr. Electro and joined \\"Los Consagrados\\" by helping them win the match. After the match was over Navarro's son Trauma I tried to stop the attack, but was attacked by his father and \\"Los Consagrados\\" ended up stealing his mask. Pirata Morgan Jr. has his father, Pirata Morgan, in his corner for the main event. The recently unmasked Pirata Morgan Jr. put his hair on the line against Golden Magic, who was putting his mask on the line in the Lucha de Apuestas match. During the match Pirata Morgan interfered on several occasions, helping his son gain an unfair advantage. In the end, Golden Magic, despite being covered in his own blood and having his mask torn to shreds, managed to pin Pirata Morgan Jr. after Pirata Morgan mistakenly hit his son with a steel chair instead of Golden Magic. As a result of his loss Pirata Morgan Jr. had to submit to the humiliation of having all his hair shaved off as per the Lucha de Apuestas stipulation.

The focal point of the Caballera vs. Caballera series of shows is one or more traditional Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet matches\\", where all competitors in the match risk their hair on the outcome of the match. The Lucha de Apuestas is considered the most prestigious match type in lucha libre, especially when a wrestlers mask is on the line, but the \\"hair vs. hair\\" stipulation is held in almost as high regard. The main event was planned and advertised as Los Piratas (Pirata Morgan, Pirata Morgan Jr. and El Hijo de Pirata Morgan) taking on Los Oficiales (Oficial 911, Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro) in a Lucha de Apuestas, or hair vs. hair match, where all three members of the losing team would be shaved bald. For unexplained reasons, IWRG had Black Warrior replace Pirata Morgan Jr. on the night of the show. Black Warrior and the remaining Los Piratas won the match, forcing all three Oficiales to have their hair shaved off afterward as lucha libre traditions dictate. The show included six additional matches. Background In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so-called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. By the same token a wrestler betting his hair in a Lucha de Apuestas is seen as highly prestigious, usually a step below the mask match.

Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Due to the absence of Pirata Morgan Jr. for the scheduled main event match several matches had to be changed around. For the fourth match L√°tigo replaced Cerebro Negro, who was moved up to the semi-main event spot. L√°tigo, Eterno and Tyson La Bestia proceeded to lose to Dinamic Black, Gallo Frances, and Pantera del Japon in two straight falls. Cerebro Negro replaced Black Warrior, and teamed with M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. and Trauma I, to defeat El Hijo de Dos Caras, Imposible, and Veneno by disqualification. During the match, El Hijo de Dos Caras became so frustrated with their opponents' repeated use of underhanded tactics that he wrapped a small steel chain around his hand and hit M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr., an illegal move that was seen by the referee and thus caused the team to be disqualified. Rearranging the competitors in the fourth and sixth match allowed IWRG to free up Black Warrior to move him into the main event alongside Pirata Morgan and El Hijo de Pirata Morgan. While not originally advertised for the six-man Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", he put his hair on the line along with the two Piratas. The trio faced off against long-time rivals of Los Piratas, a trio known as Los Oficiales (\\"The Officials\\", three wrestlers whom all use a \\"Policeman\\" ring character; Oficial 911, Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro). In the end El Hijo de Pirata Morgan pinned Oficial AK-47 to take the victory for his team. After the match ended all three Oficiales subjected themselves to have all their hair shaved off by the IWRG barber as dictated by lucha libre traditions.

Trumble Jr. (August 28, 1926 ‚Äì March 5, 2010) was an American ice hockey administrator and referee. He served as the executive director of the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States from 1972 to 1987, and managed the United States men's national ice hockey team to a silver medal at the 1972 Winter Olympics. He previously refereed games in the 1968 Winter Olympics, and was later inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, and the IIHF Hall of Fame. Early life Harold L. Trumble Jr. was born on August 28, 1926, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He began playing ice hockey as a child, then in high school, and later in a senior ice hockey league. In addition to refereeing ice hockey, he was also an international softball and baseball umpire. Refereeing career Trumble began his career as an ice hockey referee by officiating high school and college level games. He later spent 18 years officiating at the international level. He was chosen to referee ice hockey at the 1968 Winter Olympics, and was put in charge of the final games which decided the gold, silver and bronze medals. He later served as the technical director for the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) referee committee from 1972 to 1982. Administrator career Trumble served as commissioner of the United States Hockey League (USHL) during the 1960s. He was at odds with the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) and its president Tommy Lockhart, regarding the perceived lack of support from AHAUS for teams in the USHL. Lockhart was also president of the Eastern Hockey League, and that league announced plans to put teams in Michigan and Minnesota, after the USHL did not pay dues to AHAUS. Trumble was the general manager of the United States men's national ice hockey team for the 1970 World Ice Hockey Championships Pool B in Bucharest, the 1971 World Ice Hockey Championships Pool A in Switzerland, and the silver medal-winning team at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. He admitted that his job was mostly administrative in nature, such as making travel arrangements and making the team aware of the rules of the competition. He successfully pursued players on military duty to play on the national team, including Stuart Irving, Dick McGlynn and Henry Boucha; and also chose future National Hockey League (NHL) players Mark Howe and Robbie Ftorek. Trumble later managed the American men's national team at the 1983 World Ice Hockey Championships Pool B in Tokyo. Trumble became the first person to serve as the full-time executive director of AHAUS, working in that position from 1972 to 1987. He successfully led AHAUS from operating a deficit into a profitable business with its own office in Colorado Springs, Colorado, growing the full-time staff from two employees to fifteen. Trumble increased the number of teams registered with AHAUS from 7,015 in 1972, to 11,543 teams by 1985, and increased the number of referees from 3,178 to 8,434 in the same time period. He also implemented clinics for coaches and referees, and began other publications to promote the game. He authored the 1975 book Coaching Youth Ice Hockey, and the 1976 book Youth Ice Hockey. He also released videos about ice hockey skills, and training techniques. Trumble also made AHAUS the sole governing body for ice hockey in the country, which included representing the interests of the United States Olympic Committee. During his tenure, AHAUS became a member of the IIHF, and the men's national team won the gold medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics, on home ice in Lake Placid, New York. Trumble campaigned against the use of professionals at the Olympics, due to the success of the men's national team program in which collegiate athletes played for the United States, and delayed their professional careers. In 1986, he asked for the International Olympic Committee to disallow players who had signed a professional contract, instead of just those who had played in the NHL from participating in the Olympics. Personal life In 1981, Trumble acted as president of the National Council of the Youth Sports Directors. Later he worked 15 years as the manager of the Tijeras Creek Golf Club in Orange County, California. Trumble was married Ida Mae Trumble for 36 years, and had two sons and two stepdaughters. He died on March 5, 2010 in San Clemente, California. Awards and honors Trumble was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985, in the builder category. He was later inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1999, in the builder category. He was first person to receive the USA Hockey Builders Award in 1999.

The DS‚ÄìDSS alliance fell apart in early 2008, and new elections were called. Mitov received the 137th position on the DS's For a European Serbia list, which won 102 mandates. He was once again not initially selected for the party's assembly delegation but received a mandate on 16 July 2008 as the replacement for another party member.–ò–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—ò–µ –æ –æ–¥—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏–º —Å–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ü–∞–º–∞ 2008. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ (16. —ò—É–ª 2008. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ), Republika Srbija - Republiƒçka izborna komisija, accessed 16 October 2018.

The DS experienced a serious split in early 2014, with former leader Boris Tadiƒá setting up a new breakaway group that was originally called the New Democratic Party. This party contested the 2014 Serbian parliamentary election in a fusion with the Greens of Serbia and in alliance with other parties.

IWRG has held their Castillo del Terror show since 2005, usually late in the year. As with the majority of the IWRG shows it will take place at Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, the home of IWRG. The main event is the eponymous Castillo del Terror Steel cage match where the last person eliminated would be forced to unmasked per the Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", stipulation. For the 2018 event 10 men and 2 women all put their masks on the line in the steel cage which ended with Tortuga Mike defeating and unmasking Oficial Spector. In addition Passion Kristal defeated Fantasma de la Opera in a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match, forcing Fantasma de la Opera to have all his hair shaved off after the loss. Production Background Starting as far back as at least 2002, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. From 2005 IWRG has promoted a fall show, around the Mexican Day of the Death, under the name El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\"), to distinguish it from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG Guerra del Golfo (\\"Gulf War\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\"), or IWRG Prisi√≥n Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The Castillo del Terror shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2018 Castillo del Terror show will be the 14th year in a row that IWRG has promoted a show under that name. Storylines The El Castillo del Terror event will featured an undisclosed number of professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed themselves as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in wrestling matches. After losing the main event match, Oficial Spector took the microphone and revealed that his real name was Jose Manuel Mejia, born in 1975 and that he had been a professional wrestler for 30 years at the time of the cage match. With the revelation of his real name it was confirmed that he was the same person who had previously worked under the name \\"Arlequ√≠n\\" and \\"Arlequ√≠n Amarilla\\" and had lost the \\"Arlequ√≠n Amarilla\\" mask at the 2008 El Castillo del Terror exactly 10 years prior.

Being a ground wƒìtƒÅ, they are often found in burrows in the ground during the daytime (as they are also nocturnal). The species is occurs on the South Island and is classified as \\"Naturally Uncommon\\". This species of wƒìtƒÅ is unusual for an insect in that the female looks after her eggs and nymphs, this is known as maternal care.  Taxonomy  Hemiandrus electra was first described in 2013, but had been referred to in previous publications by an informal (tag) name (Hemiandrus 'okiwi'). The species name comes from the Greek name Elektra, one of the Pleiades sisters (in Greek mythology the seven daughters of Pleione and Atlas), meaning amber or shinning. This name is given to this species due to the bight orange colour of the insects, and as sister to H. maia, a reference to their morphological similarity.  Habitat/distribution  Hemiandrus electra are endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. Because they are a ground wƒìtƒÅ, they are often found in burrows in the ground during the day, as they are a nocturnal species. During the night however, they are quite active on the ground, but are also found in vegetation.  Conservation  The New Zealand Department of Conservation classified this species as naturally uncommon  Diet  Hemiandrus electra is probably omnivorous, but has only been observed eating invertebrates such as cicada  Morphology  Kahurangi ground wƒìtƒÅ females have a medium-length ovipositor. Male and females have fore tibiae with a single superior prolateral spine (excluding apical spine); mid tibiae with two superior prolateral spines and three superior retrolateral spines (excluding apical spines). Morphological they are very similar to the Otago ground wƒìtƒÅ H. maia, but can be distinguished by number of tergal stridulatory pegs and male terminalia.  Behavior  Hemiandrus electra come out of their burrows at night. During mating males provide the female with a nuptial food gift. The females share burrows with their eggs and care for nymphs.

It has the same musical purpose as the \\"bossed gongs\\" (circular gongs that have a rounded bump in the center, like a shield boss) and may substitute for them and accompany singing. Although it is a traditional instrument with a long history, it has been improved on in modern times. The kong ring is represented by similar instruments in other countries of South Asia and the Pacific. Styles There are two different syles; the traditional uses bamboo to make the sounding strings, and a more modern style uses new materials. Traditional Originally, the strings played were created by cutting the outer layer or crust of the bamboo, to separate 7 strings (leaving them attached to the tube at each end), and placing a bridge pressed underneath at each end. Resonance holes were cut under the strings, long and narrow. New materials Instead of creating strings from the bamboo, metal strings are also be used, attached with pegs. A resonator gourd may also be added; this may be less a resonator than a way to stabilize the instrument as it is held against the chest. Asian and Pacific variants Variants of the Kong ring can be found Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Madagascar and the Philippines. Madagascar valiha player with his instrument. This instrument has features found on both the old and new kong ring. Like the new, it uses metal strings. Like the old it uses bridges to tighten the strings, rather than pegs. Like the dinh goong it has the ends of the strings secured inside the bamboo tube. In Vietnam, a variant exists today, the ƒê√†n goong, that looks like the modern Cambodian instrument, with as many as 17 metal strings and pegs. With instruments made with steel strings the Vietnamese instruments have one end secured inside the bamboo tube, the other wrapped around a peg on the opposite end, to add string tension and to lift the stings off the bamboo tube. In Thailand, it can be found among the Karenni Kayan people, where it may have as many as 8 bamboo strings cut from the resonator. Among the Kareni, it is used for love songs, providing a \\"delicate rhythmic accompanyment.\\" Variants in Malaysia, Madagascar and the Philippines resemble the older style of kong ring, with strings cut from the bamboo tube and bridges placed under the strips of bamboo turned into strings. Placement of the bridges, and the ability to move them, allows for the Valiha to be tuned to different scales. In Madagascar the instrument is called valiha. In East Timor it is the \\"lakado.\\" In Malaysia it is called karaniing and krem. It is used widely in the Philippines and goes by multiple names including kolitong and kulibit. Similar tube zithers are believed by some to be the origin of the Chinese GuzhengKaufmann, Walter (1976) Musical References in the Chinese Classics. Detroit Monographs in Musicology. Harmonie Park Press. p. 101. \\"According to the Shuo Wen the cheng was a bamboo-tube zither. [‚Ä¶] The bamboo tube eventually was replaced by a larger curved wooden board and while in one or two zither types fixed or movable bridges were used, the noble ch'in remained an unfretted instrument. Despite the fact that the cheng is not mentioned in the Classics, it is mentioned here because of its old age. The movable bridges which allowed variable tunings linked the cheng securely with popular music. It still exists side by side with the distinguished ch'in and se. Since the fourth or third centuries B.C. there existed another form of the se, a zither with five (to thirteen) strings, called chu (M 1375).

He is one of three artists on the Billboard documentary piece, ‚ÄúSaving Chicago: Inside Hip-Hop's Movement to Make Chicago a Better Place‚Äù.  Biography  Malcolm London, who is African-American, was born in 1993 and grew up in the west side of Chicago in a neighborhood called Austin. He first started writing poems when he was 12 and poetry quickly became an important part of London's life. He attended Lincoln Park High School and in his sophomore year he won individual honors at the Louder Than A Bomb youth poetry competition. When he was 20, he participated in a TED talk where he read a portion of his poem, \\"High School Training Grounds\\". After graduating from high school in 2011, London began working for Kevin Coval, a fellow poet and educator who helped create the Louder Than A Bomb poetry festival. London was paid to help with the organization Young Chicago Authors, talking at local schools and running poetry workshops with students in the area.

Over the summer, London participated in a similar event in Pittsburgh where he again worked with Matt Damon and also John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, and Francis McDormand. In September 2012, Malcolm London appeared on a television series called \\"Verses & Flow\\" which features performances of music and poetry. He read a poem entitled, \\"The First Time in a While\\" which was based on a peer of London's who had been killed in a fight. In reading his poem, London became he youngest poet to appear in the first three seasons of the show. In time, London would go on to appear on several TED Talks with John Legend and Bill Gates, and host events and performances with friend and fellow YCA alum Chance the Rapper and rapper Lupe Fiasco. His performances of poetry have taken place all across Chicago including at the Chicago Jazz Festival, the Du Sable Museum, the Vic Theater, The Metro, The Chicago Theater, Victory Gardens Theatre, and Steppenwolf Theater, where was a member of the Young Adult Council. London has also been the co-chair of the Chicago chapter of the Black Youth Project and has done a lot of service for Chicago Public schools and the city's community. Malcolm is known for using his art to inspire activism. He was a member of UCAN's National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention and has championed a variety of issues through his poetry and talks. Malcolm London has written many poems, some of his most famous being \\"High School Training Ground,‚Äù \\"Never Too Late,‚Äù ‚ÄúRome Wasn‚Äôt Built In A Day (Love Sosa),‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy You Talk Like That.‚Äù He also has a range of music that appears on SoundCloud.

The church was situated on the 300 block of Charles Street at Saratoga Street. The first resident pastor of the church was Fr. Charles Sewell of St. Mary's County. St. Peter's served all Catholics within the city of Baltimore who could travel to it, which was an anomaly among Catholic churches in the United States before 1884, which were largely defined by the nationality of their parishioners. The trustees of the pro-cathedral purchased six acres of land in Baltimore in 1814 to use as a burial ground for Catholics of the city. This cemetery was opened in 1816 and, when it ran out of space in 1887, was closed. The remains were transferred to the new cathedral cemetery. It served as the pro-cathedral of the Archdiocese of Baltimore until an official cathedral, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, was built in 1821 to alleviate overcrowding at St. Peter's. With an increase of the Catholic population of Baltimore from 800 in 1792 to 10,000, the pro- cathedral was only able to accommodate a tenth of its total parishioners at any given Sunday Mass. The new cathedral was built one block to the north of St. Peter's. St. Peter's was closed in 1841, and demolished by 1845, when the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools established Calvert Hall on the site.

Origins He was the son of Robert de St John (d.1267) by his wife believed to have been Agnes de Cantilupe, a daughter of William de Cantilupe.G. E. Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, n.s., vol.XI, p.323 Career John inherited his fathers title in 1267, upon the death of his father and succeeded him as governor of Porchester Castle in Hampshire. In November 1276, he was one of the magnates present at the council which judgment was given against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. He participated in King Edward I of England's invasions of Wales in 1277 and 1282. He was summoned to the Shrewsbury parliament in 1283. During Edward I's stay in Aquitaine between 1286-1289, he was involved in negotiations between King Alfonso III of Aragon and King Charles II of Naples and was one of the hostages handed over to King Alfonso III in 1288 to secure the conditions upon which the Charles, Prince of Salerno had been released. He returned to England in early 1289 and attended parliament in May 1290. St John was despatched in 1290 on a mission to Pope Nicholas IV regarding the crusading a projected crusade. During March, St John was at Tarascon, dealing with business from Edward I's mediation between Sicily and Aragon. In November 1292, St John was in Scotland attending on the king, during the selection of the next King of Scotland, in favour of John Balliol. In 1293, relations between Edward I and King Philip IV of France became strained, and St John was dispatched to Gascony as the king's lieutenant. St John went about strengthening and provisioning the fortified towns and castles, and in providing adequate garrisons for them. Edmund Crouchback unwittingly allowed the temporary possession of the Gascon strongholds, without legal authority by the French. St John deliver seisin of Gascony to its French overlord and admitted the French into the castles, sold off the provisions and stores that he had collected, and returned to England by way of Paris. Edward I, angered by the French occupation of Aquitaine, prepared to recover his inheritance by force. Due to instability and revolution in Wales, Edward I appointed his nephew John of Brittany as his lieutenant in Aquitaine with St John as seneschal and chief counsellor on 1 July 1294. The expedition left Plymouth on 1 October, arriving at the Gironde estuary on the 28 October. Macau was captured on 31 October and Bourg and Blaye were next subdued. The fleet then sailed up the Garonne river to Bordeaux, however failed to capture the town. Rions was then captured, along with Podensac and Villeneuve. St John left John of Brittany at Rions, travelling with a force by river and sea to Bayonne and attacked the town. On 1 January 1295 the citizens of Bayonne, drove the French garrison into the castle and opened the town gates to him. St John attacked Bayonne Castle, which surrendered eleven days later after a siege. Many Gascons then joined the English army. Charles of Valois, invaded Aquitaine at the head of a French army and won back most of the English conquests in the Garonne valley. St John and John of Brittany were at Rions, however were so alarmed at the fall of the neighbouring towns that they abandoned Rions, with the French re-entering Rions on 8 April 1295. King Edward I sent Edmund of Lancaster in 1296 to take over command at Bordeaux. During the siege of Bayonne in 1296, the English ran out of money, so the army disbanded. Disheartened Edmund died on 5 June 1296. Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln took over command with St John as Seneschal. Bayonne was again recaptured after an eight-day siege. On 28 January 1297 St John marched with de Lacy to convey provisions to Bellegarde, which being besieged by Robert, Count of Artois. The English army was ambushed and St John's column was attacked and St John was taken prisoner along with ten other knights. St John was sent to Paris and was kept in captivity until being released after the Treaty of Montreuil in the summer of 1299. His captivity caused St John to be in heavy debts and was forced to pledge four of his manors for sixteen years to the merchants of the society of the Buonsignori of Siena. On 3 January 1300, St John was appointed the king's lieutenant and captain in Cumberland, Westmoreland, Lancashire, Annandale, and the other marches west of Roxburgh. During the famous siege of Carlaverock in 1300, St John was entrusted with the custody of Prince Edward of Carnarvon, Edward I's son, who was taking part in his first campaign. During 1301, St John was warden of Galloway and the sheriffdom of Dumfries, as well as of the adjacent marches. In the spring of that year he was appointed, with John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey and others, to treat at Canterbury of a peace between the English and the Scots with the envoys of Philip IV of France. In January 1301 St John was at the Lincoln parliament, and signed the Barons' Letter of 1301 to the pope, although not himself a baron, never having been summpned by writ to parliament.G. E. Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, n.s., vol.XI, pp.324-5 On 12 July 1302 he was with the king at Westminster, however returned to his border command, where he died on Thursday 6 September 1302, at Lochmaben Castle, Scotland.

Early life Ulrych was born on April 9, 1888 in Kalisz, Congress Poland, in a wealthy Lutheran merchant family. His ancestors were ethnic Germans, who settled in the area of Kalisz, Turek and Stawiszyn. Ulrych, the son of Emil and Berta nee Stark, attended City Classical Gymnasium in Kalisz and St. Ann Gymnasium in Krak√≥w. After graduation, he continued his education at Lw√≥w Polytechnic. Since his teens, Ulrych was an active member of Polish independence organizations, such as the Riflemen's Association. After the outbreak of World War One, he joined Polish Legions of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, becoming one of the officers of the 1st Legions Infantry Regiment. In late stages of the war, he was transferred to his native Kalisz, where, as a member of the Polish Military Organization, he commanded the disarming of German soldiers (November 1918). During the Polish-Soviet War (1919‚Äì1921), Ulrych, among others, formed the 29th Regiment of Kani√≥w Riflemen (29 Pu≈Çk Strzelc√≥w Kaniowskich). He was later awarded the Virtuti Militari and the Cross of Valour (Poland) (three times). After the Polish-Soviet War, Ulrych worke in the Information Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs and in the Headquarters of the Polish Army. In 1922 - 1923, he attended Warsaw's War College (Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Wojenna). In 1927 - 1929, Ulrych was chairman of the State Office of Physical Education and Basic Training, and one of his main ideas was the creation of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw. In 1929 - 1931 he commanded the 36th Infantry Regiment (Poland). In January 1931, he was appointed deputy commandant of the 4th Office of the Army Headquarters.

Furthermore, in 1938 - 1939 he was a deputy to the Sejm, and in 1939 was named Chief of Communication in the Army Headquarters. On September 17, 1939 (see Soviet Invasion of Poland), Ulrych, together with his family and other members of Polish government, crossed the Polish-Romanian border. He was interned by the Romanian government in Baile Herculane. In 1940, Ulrych left Romania and via Turkey and Cyprus he went to France, where he wanted to join Polish forces. Newly formed Polish Government in Exile, under General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, did not allow him to enter the army, and Ulrych was transferred to clerical work. In 1941 Ulrych moved to England. After the war Ulrych, to support his family, worked in the so-called Silver Brigade, a group of former officials of the Second Polish Republic, who, for lack of other opportunities, cleaned silverware at London's Claridge's Hotel. Later, he worked as a lift operator at Harrods. In ca. 1950, Ulrych was named a consultant at the British War Office. He was actively involved in Polish social life in exile, as deputy chairman of Main Council of Independence League, a pro-Sanacja political organization. Death and legacy Juliusz Ulrych died on October 31, 1959 in London. In 1989, his ashes were transported to Warsaw, and buried at the Legions Tomb of the Military Quarter at the PowƒÖzki Cemetery.

H. Gray, was a pioneer colonist of South Australia who amassed considerable wealth through ownership and development of land. History Gray was born to Thomas and Ellen Gray in Bermondsey, London, England and baptised in St Mary's Church, Newington on 4 September 1808. He was educated at Bacon's School on Grange Road, Bermondsey, apprenticed as a tanner, and worked at that trade until the age of 29 years. From around 1830 he attended night classes in London, where he made the acquaintance of Robert Thomas, founder of The Register, and J. M. Skipper, and through them became interested in the theories of E. G. Wakefield and the projected colony of South Australia. Gray, his sister Elizabeth, and two servants emigrated to South Australia aboard John Renwick, six months after the \\"First Fleet of South Australia\\", arriving in February, 1837. He had purchased the rights to three (as yet unsurveyed and unallocated) land packages consisting of one town acre (0.40 ha) and one country property of from the South Australian Company for a total outlay of ¬£243. The 80 acres was later increased to . Colonel Light completed his city survey in March 1837 and purchasers of preliminary town acres were able to make their selections in turn, as determined by lot. City acres not selected were then auctioned, and Gray picked up another 14 of the 595 offered, at a total cost of ¬£126 6s. Most of Gray's selections were in the north-west corner of the city, his rationale being that business would develop close to the Port Road. Gray and his manservant built a thatched pug and pine cottage on one of his North Terrace allotments, so the little party could move from their tents to something more secure and comfortable. His properties were acre 3 on North Terrace, 60‚Äì62 on the north side and 63‚Äì65 on the south side of Hindley Street and 119‚Äì123 on the north side of Currie Street. Sections 3, 60, 65 and 122 ran in a straight line between North Terrace and Currie Street, and Gray ran a thoroughfare (Gray Street) through the middle of them, and built cottages on either side; some quite densely packed. Acre 63 later became the site of \\"Campden\\", his town house. His other selections were in North Adelaide: Kermode Street, Brougham Place, Childers Street and Barton Terrace. Acre 727 on Brougham Place and 722 on Kermode Street were contiguous, and Gray drove a thoroughfare (Bagot's Lane) through their centres. Town Acre 747 on Barton Terrace he left intact and later became the site of Ru Rua Hospital. A limited number of country sections became available for selection in May 1838 and preliminary purchasers like Gray were in a good position to choose the better land, and closer to the city. He was entitled to three, and chose sections 203 just north of Glenelg, 420 near Port Adelaide in the angle between the Old and New Port Roads, and 376 on the Port Road much closer to the city. Then in the release to the general public he picked up another six sections north of 203, giving him around in the West Beach area. This was the beginning of his holdings in The Reedbeds area, the shallow marshland of the Torrens outlet which includes the modern suburbs Fulham, Lockleys and Underdale. By 1843 he and his tenants had 100 acres of wheat and 10 of barley and some pigs, cows and horses beside. In the early 1840s the Colony was bankrupted by Governor Gawler's lavish spending on infrastructure (largely to stave off unemployment) and George Grey was sent out to replace him, and effected strict economies. In the resulting recession, many colonists were made insolvent, and Gray, who relied on rent from his city cottages for much of his income, was forced to borrow heavily in a desperate gamble to avoid joining them. By 1845 however, with a little help from the Burra copper mine, the colony's economy had turned around and by 1848 Gray had repaid his creditors. In 1850‚Äì1851 Gray added another including sections 165, 215, 216 and 169 to his holdings in the Reedbeds area, but later that year an exodus of able-bodied men from South Australia to the Victorian goldfields began, and until late 1853 when the tide started to turn, income from his rental properties dropped away, and he invested in no new properties. In 1855 he added to his portfolio some of good cereal-growing Barossa land, which he leased and later sold to German settlers at a sizable profit. In 1858 he was able to purchase from Joseph Johnson, \\"Frogmore\\", a Reedbeds farm, and moved into its attractive (now long since demolished) cottage near what is now the north-west intersection of West Beach and Tapleys Hill roads. William Henry Gray (1808‚Äì1896) of the Reedbeds, Adelaide, c. 1870 It is likely that Gray was brought up in the Church of England into which he had been baptised, and his sister was a congregant at Trinity Church, but at some stage he became a Unitarian and contributed to the erection of the Church in Wakefield Street. He was a friend of the Rev. John Crawford Woods, who solemnized his marriage to Rosetta Bagshaw on 16 January 1861. The disparity in their ages may have prompted fellow-Unitarian Catherine Helen Spence to write, in a work of fiction: > \\"It is not natural or right for a girl of nineteen to marry a man of fifty- > three, and that is his age, as everyone knows, and, besides, though he is > very pleasant with you, he is a man of the world, and only cares for people > when they are able to give him pleasure or do him service\\" Catherine Helen > Spence, Hugh Lindsay's Guest, or This Author's Daughter (serialized in The > Observer, 1867) How they became engaged is a mystery, but it is likely that Gray and her father, John Stokes Bagshaw, who were of similar ages and arrived in the colony in the same year, knew each other well. Gray and Miss Bagshaw may have met at field days run by the Agricultural and Horticultural Society. Last years Gray enjoyed good health to the age of 80, then was forced by failing eyesight and susceptibility to winter cold to spend less and less time at his beloved sheep farm at the Reedbeds and more time at \\"Campden\\", the comfortable house on town acre 63 at the southern corner of Hindley Street and West Terrace which he had purchased half a century earlier. He became obsessed with death, and attended funerals of even the slightest acquaintance. He personally supervised the construction of a family vault at the West Terrace Cemetery. He drew up his will in 1890 and in the last years of his life appended five codicils, the third of which reduced the allowance to his wife, to whom he had become estranged, from ¬£100 to ¬£30 per annum. He gifted the extensive Reedbeds property to his five sons, his West Terrace property to his wife and daughter Jane, and his North Adelaide properties to daughters Bessie and Edith in order to avoid inheritance taxes. His remaining properties were willed for the benefit of his children, and then his grandchildren \\"share and share alike\\". He died in the early Spring of 1896, and was interred in the vault, with a large attendance which included his friend the retired Rev. Woods, his doctor Benjamin Poulton (died 1921) and lawyer Moulden. The burial service was conducted by Woods' successor the Rev. Alexander Wilson. Beneficiaries of his Will included the Bacon School (see above), the Home for Incurables, the Institution for the Blind, Deaf and Dumb but, surprisingly, not the Children's Hospital, which had been the recipient of much of his largess while alive. His widow's allowance, whittled down in the third codicil, was restored to its original value by the lawyers. Other interests *Gray was a member of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society from 1857, a committee member 1858 to 1862 or later, and was still exhibiting in 1892. *He was in 1860 a founding member of the Reedbeds Cavalry, a unit of the South Australian Militia, and as Lieutenant Gray resigned in May 1861. His neighbours Gabriel Bennett and Charles and Samuel White were prominent members. *In 1867 he made a voyage to Albany, Western Australia, hoping to negotiate purchase of large quantities of jarrah timber, but failed where M. C. Davies later succeeded, and built up a substantial business. *In 1868 Gray purchased from Alexander Wearing two properties of at the Head of the Bight, from Fowler's Bay on the western boundary of what is now Yalata community land. Gray knew of Eyre's description of extensive grassy plains and reckoned if only permanent water were found, he could make a fortune from the property. To that end he sent a party of workers, led by one William Marks, to dig a well. They spent six months chipping away at the obdurate rock, before Gray realised the futility of their effort and ceased operations. \\"Gray's Well\\", a shallow dry shaft, may still be seen today, close to Nullarbor Station homestead. *He was chairman of the District Council of West Torrens at least 1868‚Äì1878, reportedly for twenty years. He had in 1862 been accused by longtime antagonist George Dew of membership of the Council for his own ends, notably the road which the council had run from Glenelg to \\"Frogmore\\". *In 1869 he pulled down the old \\"Buck's Head\\" hotel (whose clientele consisted largely of salesmen and butchers from the market opposite) at 24 North Terrace (between Newmarket and Gray streets) and built a new one in its place, architect Daniel Garlick and builder Charles Farr. :He also owned the Foundry Hotel on the north-east corner of Hindley and Gray streets (Acre 60) and two smaller ones on the north side of Currie Street: the Yorke Peninsula Inn at c. 248 (Acre 123) and the Ship Inn at c. 190 (Acre 120). *He was appointed Justice of the Peace in March 1869 to at least 1886. *In 1873 he had a large interest in the Larrakeeyah Gold Mining Company and the Nina Reef Gold Mining Company, both Northern Territory prospects, but appears to have relinquished them later that year. *He promoted W. H. Bean's successful candidature for the seat of West Torrens in 1878. *He was in 1878 a promoter and director of the Holdfast Bay Railway Company, but had to resign the following year after a serious accident left him immobile. *In 1885 he floated the Daly River Plantation Company to grow sugar cane, and purchased machinery from G. T. Bean's defunct Port Darwin Sugar Company at one tenth its purchase price, but in company with the De Lissa Sugar Company, this venture also failed. *Gray was a longtime friend of B. A. Moulden, his lawyer, associate in many ventures, and co-executor of his Will. Places named for Gray and his family *Gray Street, Adelaide *Rosetta Street, West Croydon, was named for Mrs. Gray. It is intersected by Alfred Road and Herbert Road. *Rosetta Street, Rosewater, previously Graytown, was named for Mrs. Gray. It runs between Edith Street and Gray Terrace. *Bagshaw Crescent, and the suburb of Gray in Palmerston, Northern Territory, were named for Rosetta and W. H. Gray. Recognition *The Gray Prize is, or was at least until 1977, awarded annually by Bacon's School, Bermondsey, England, in recognition of Gray's ¬£300 bequest to the school. *He is commemorated by a plaque on the North Terrace, Adelaide, footpath as part of the Jubilee 150 Walkway.

Journal of Orthopteran Research 6: 125‚Äì138 Being a ground weta, they are often found in burrows in the ground during the daytime (as they are nocturnal). The species is found in Wellington, on Mana Island and northern South Island and is classified as \\"Not Threatened\\". This species of weta is unusual for an insect in that the female shows maternal care. She lays about 50 eggs in the same burrow she uses during the day and looks after her eggs until they hatch.  Taxonomy  Hemiandrus bilobatus was first described in 1938. The specific name refers to the two lobes on the ventral surface of the abdominal tergites of adult females.Johns PM 2001. Distribution and conservation status of ground weta, Hemiandrus species (Orthoptera: Anostostomatidae). Science for Conservation 180, New Zealand Department of Conservation, Wellington, New Zealand. Hemiandrus bilobatus includes populations of ground weta found in the Awatere Valley in Marlborough previously referred at as Hemiandrus \\"promontorius\\" or \\"Cape Campbell\\".  Habitat/distribution  Hemiandrus bilobatus are endemic to the Wellington and Marlborough regions of New Zealand. They are often found in burrows in the ground during the day, and are only active at night. During the night they are quite active on the ground, but are also found in on tree trunks and foliage.  Conservation  The New Zealand Department of Conservation classified this species as not threatened.  Diet  Hemiandrus bilobatus are omnivorous. They have been observed eating invertebrates such as Deinacrida rugosa (giant weta), moths and beetle larvae and feeding on the young buds of grape vines. Control of ground weta in vineyards has been tried using a number of approaches, the most effective method being a layer of mussel shells under the vines.  Morphology  Cook Strait ground weta females have a very short ovipositor.  Behavior  Hemiandrus biolobatus come out of their burrows at night. During mating males provide the female with a nuptial food gift. The females share burrows with their eggs and care for nymphs.

After the implementations of the Italian Racial Laws in 1938, Sonne migrated to the United States where he taught at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, where he died in 1960. Sonne made considerable contributions to the Wissenschaft des Judentums. Biography Sonne was born in Mosciska, Galicia, then part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, on 26 February 1887 and was educated in Switzerland and Italy, receiving a Rabbinical degree there in 1925. He taught, for a short time, at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ but moved to Florence, Italy in 1925 to teach Rabbinical literature and the Talmud at the Rabbinic College there, the Collegio Rabbinico. Apart from teaching he also engaged in research into the Jewish history in Italy. In the mid-1930s Sonne became the first to compile a partial catalogue of the Biblioteca della Comunit√† Israelitica, looted by the Nazis in October 1943 and never recovered. Sonne, however, complained that he was allowed to see only the second-best items in the library. From 1936 to 1938 he taught on the island of Rhodes, then part of the Kingdom of Italy, as the director of the Jewish Theological Seminar there, a post subsidised by the Italian government with the aim of spreading Italian culture. Sonne's aim, while on Rhodes, was to bridge the gap of knowledge between Eastern and Western Jews and, in the words of Salo Wittmayer Baron, \\"infuse the Levantine Jewry with the Wissenschaft des Judentums\\". After the implementation of the Anti-Semitic Italian Racial Laws in 1938 Sonne lost his post and emigrated to the United States by 1940. He became a professor of the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, where he died on 27 November 1960.

The company was founded in 2004 by John Davey under the name CherryPharm, and later rebranded to Cheribundi in 2012. History Cheribundi was initially founded in 2004 by John Davey. After quitting his job as a Wall Street banker in 2006, Davey worked with Cornell food scientist Olga Padilla-Zakour, who directs the Food Venture Center (FVC) at Cornell's New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, to develop an all-natural tart cherry juice. The resulting product was named CherryPharm, as the drink retained what are believed to be pain-prevention and muscle-damage recovery properties of sour cherries. CherryPharm rebranded as Cheribundi in 2012. Growth Steve Pear, the current CEO, joined the company in 2014 from Odwalla, which is a part of the Coca-Cola company. Pear was preceded by Brian Ross, who served as CEO from 2009-2013. In 2016, the company invested more than $4 million to relocate its facilities to the former Tops Friendly Markets on New York State Routes 5 and 20, directly creating 35 new jobs as part of the \\"Finger Lakes Forward\\" initiative. In March 2018, the company raised 5.79 million dollars through private investors. The company previously made their products at the Cornell Agriculture and Food Technology Park, where it resided from 2006 to 2017. Cheribundi has grown from one office space at the park to four offices, a lab, production space and a 100,000-square-foot distribution center. Products The company's main product line is tart cherry juice, with the original version containing 200 cherries per 32 fluid ounces, and 160 cherries in the \\"light\\" version. Cheribundi's 100% Tart version contains one ingredient (tart cherries), is not from concentrate, and has no added sugars. Juice is distributed in 8, 12, 24 and 32-ounce bottles. Cheribundi is distributed at stores across the United States, including retailers such as Wegmans Foods Markets Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp., Safeway Inc. and Whole Foods. In addition to online sales, the company sells to roughly 220 professional and collegiate sports teams, including the New York Giants, New York Knicks, New York Mets and New York Rangers. The fruit The positive effects of tart cherry juice in Cheribundi are thought to be the result of phyto-nutrients and anti-oxidants, such as anthocyanins, melatonin and quercetin. These compounds occur naturally and are in high proportion in deeply colored fruits, such as tart cherries. Research Cheribundi products have been the subject of much research, with studies conducted by third parties that include the British Journal of Sports Medicine and the Journal of Nutrition. Research has also been conducted at various research institutions, including Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, the VA Medical Center, and the University of Pennsylvania. The company has promoted these studies as indicating that consumers of their beverages will receive a wide range of health benefits against muscle fatigue and joint inflammation. Consuming Montmorency cherries, used to make Cheribundi, also improves gut health by stimulating the growth of good bacteria. Corporate Sponsorships Cheribundi is the title sponsor of the Boca Raton Bowl, an NCAA College Football bowl game. Cheribundi will serve as the title sponsor through the 2019 season. The company also partners with the team nutritionists of over 220 sports teams, while also sponsoring professional athletes such as Aly Raisman, the McCourty Twins, Devin McCourty and Jason McCourty, Team Crossfit Mayhem and Mayhem Teams, and Trey Wingo, host of ESPN Golic and Wingo, NFL PrimeTime, and SportsCenter specials on ESPN.

He wrote It is spread over the picturesque multi- level landscapes of the gray smoky Carpathians: hills, valleys, hills and many streams. In spring it sinks in apple-pink-white flowers, in summer - in a fabulous variety of Carpathian flowers, in autumn - in delicious, aromatic fruits of apples - \\"ferkovani\\", and in winter the same apple-trees, shrouded in silver frost and white dazzling snow.

A bell tower was built near the church. Not far from the temple is a church lighthouse (build in 1863) and a chapel (built in 1860). The lighthouse was erected for the priests' residence and for the educational activities of the children. In Soviet times it was used as a school and as a hostel for children from remote parts of the village. The chapel was erected at the expense of goldsmiths who worked in America. At the request of the wage earners, five crosses of hewn stone were made for the remnants of these funds. A newer Russian Orthodox church is near the center of the village on a side road.

The front officially declared its formation on October 13, 2018 at the National Press Club ahead of national election. Kamal Hossain, former Law Minister and Leader of the Gano Forum and Jatiya Oikya Front Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, General Secretary of Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jatiya Oikya Front The front currently comprises Gono Forum, Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal-JSD and Nagorik Oikya. Later, on 5 November 2018, Krishak Sramik Janata League, led by Bangabir Kader Siddique joined the front. The front has declared seven demands and eleven goals for a free, fair and credible election and to ensure the balance of power in the government structure.  Members  # Bangladesh Nationalist Party # Gano Forum # Nagorik Oikya # JSD Background With the Grand Alliance Victory in 2008, an Awami League-led government took charge in January 2009, and abolished the caretaker government system that used to oversee the national elections since 1991. Abolishment of caretaker government Though the election, through which Awami League and their allies got elected, was conducted by an election-time technocrat caretaker government, the government abolished the system in 2011 following a court verdict that declared the thirteenth amendment of the constitution illegal. The abolishment of an agreed system to oversee the national election enraged the opposition groups who boycotted the general election in 2014 and took streets demanding the restoration of the caretaker government system to oversee the election. When the government started suppressing the opposition movement, they retaliated violently that caused death to no less than three-hundred people across the country. 2014 national election In the election of 2014, only 12 of the 42 registered parties took part and 154 constituencies were left disenfranchised. The opposition leader of the parliament, Begum Khaleda Zia was placed under house arrest before the election that continued for another week. In March 2014, after months of turbulence, Begum Khaleda Zia called off the strike and urged to forge a national unity. Later, in 2015, Bangladesh Nationalist Party again enforced a country-wide blockade when their chairperson was not allowed to take part in a procession and put under house arrest in her office building. They demanded the restoration of neutral caretaker government system again, but to no avail. Jatiya Oikya Prokriya floated In August 2016, against the backdrop of a political uncertainty, former foreign minister of Bangladesh government and eminent jurist Dr. Kamal Hossain floated the platform ‚ÄúJatiya Oikya Prokriya‚Äù that loosely translates into National Unity Process in English. The platform aimed at working to expedite a national unity among the battling political groups by reducing their differences by holding talks and seminars. Throughout 2016 to 2018, Oikya Prokriya held several seminars and invited leaders from prominent political parties aligned with the spirit of Bangladesh Liberation War. On September 13, 2018, after months of talks Oikya Prokriya declared to work together with a newly formed political force led by former President Badruddoza Chowdhury of Bikalpadhara Bangladesh. On September 22 of the same year, Jatiya Oikya Prokriya held a public rally at Dhaka. BNP, Bikalpadhara, Nagorik Oikya, JSD, Gono Forum, Bangladesh Jatiya Party and some other parties shared the stage in the rally. They declared a four-point-demand in the rally. Also, a declaration to work from the same platform came from the podium that day. Formation Jatiya Oikya Prokriya spearheaded by Gono Forum arranged several meetings with BNP, Bikalpadhara, JSD and Nagorik Oikya from the last week of September to the second week of October. Finally on October 13, 2018 the top-tier leaders of all the parties except Bikapadhara sat together and chalked out their demands and goals in a long meeting, and declared the emergence of Jatiyo Oikya Front (National Unity Front), through a press conference held at National Press Club. Bikalpadhara parted ways from the front as their demands were not fully met. Demands and goals The front unanimously placed seven demands and eleven goals. The seven demands are placed to ensure a free, fair and credible election. While the eleven goals are the basic outline of how the front will run the government if elected. The front has a major focus on ensuring a balance of power among the ruling party and the opposition groups. Demands A boy is reading the demands proposal poster in Jatiya Oikya Front Event The seven-point-demand of the front includes: # To hold a free and fair election, the government must step down; parliament must be dissolved and an election-time neutral government must be formed following discussions. Khaleda Zia must be freed. The government must withdraw all cases against her and other BNP leaders and activists. # Reforms to the EC with the appointment of people acceptable to all parties through discussions. Electronic voting machines must not be used in the election. # Ensure freedom of speech for individuals, newspapers and electronic and social media, and all political parties‚Äô meetings and rallies. # Withdraw all cases against students involved in the protests for reforms to the quota system in government jobs and road safety measures, and against the journalists ‚Äúcharged for expressing their views‚Äù.

Luria's congressional district serves most of the heart of Hampton Roads, including all of Virginia Beach, Williamsburg and Poquoson and portions of Norfolk and Hampton. Before running for Congress, she served as a Navy officer for 20 years. Luria rose to the rank of commander and spent the majority of her career deployed on navy ships. Luria defeated Republican incumbent Scott Taylor in 2018. She is currently running for a second term and will face Taylor in a rematch. Early life and education Luria was born on August 15, 1975 in Birmingham, Alabama. Her mother Michelle's family immigrated to Jasper, Alabama, in 1906. The family sold goods to coal miners in Walker County, Alabama. In the early-1900s, Luria's great-grandfather helped spawn a Reform Jewish congregation in Jasper, and her immediate family joined the Temple Emanu-El in Birmingham. Luria's mother and grandmother were active in the National Council of Jewish Women (of which her mother was President), Hadassah, the Temple Emanu-El Sisterhood, and the Birmingham Jewish Federation. Luria graduated from Indian Springs School in 1993. She graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science (BS) with a double major in physics and history, and a minor in French. In 2000, Luria attended the United States Naval Nuclear Power School. While serving in the Navy and stationed aboard the flagship , she earned a Master of Science (MS) degree in engineering management from Old Dominion University in 2004. Military service Luria served as a Navy officer for 20 years, operating nuclear reactors as an engineer, where she rose to the rank of commander. Luria was the first female American sailor to spend her entire career on combat ships. She served first aboard , a forward deployed destroyer that was sent to the Middle East. Luria was in charge of Tomahawk strike missiles, and managed a division of 15 people. She then became Reactor Controls Division Officer on , an aircraft carrier, which also deployed to the Middle East. Luria became Flag Aide to the commander of the United States Seventh Fleet once she made lieutenant. She was deployed on destroyer and nuclear-powered aircraft carrier before serving as an executive officer on the guided missile cruiser . She became maintenance coordinator for the United States Atlantic Fleet, overseeing , another nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. She then commanded Assault Craft Unit TWO, a combat-ready unit of 400 sailors, from 2014 until her retirement in 2017. She held a Passover seder on an aircraft carrier shortly after 9/11. Luria's service was the longest active-duty tenure of any current member of the House Democratic Caucus. United States House of Representatives Congressional district Virginia's 2nd congressional district is centered on Hampton Roads. It includes all of Poquoson, Virginia Beach, and Williamsburg cities and York County in Hampton Roads; parts of Norfolk and Hampton cities and James City County in Hampton Roads; and all of Accomack and Northampton counties on the Eastern Shore. Elections 2018 elections In the 2018 elections, Luria ran for the United States House of Representatives in . In the Democratic primary on June 10, Luria garnered 62% of the vote, defeating Karen Mallard, who received 38%. In the November 6, 2018 election, she defeated Republican incumbent Scott Taylor, winning 51% of the vote to Taylor's 49%. Luria carried six of the district's nine county-level jurisdictions, including all but one of the district's five independent cities. She also carried Taylor's hometown of Virginia Beach. 2020 elections Luria is running for re-election in the 2020 elections. Tenure Luria was sworn in on January 3, 2019. She was one of 102 female members elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2018, a record number. She joined two other female veterans in that class, fellow Naval Academy graduate Mikie Sherrill and former Air Force officer Chrissy Houlahan. On Veterans Day 2019, she released a video announcing her support for an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, which The Washington Post called \\"an unusual move for a moderate on the cusp of a tough reelection.\\" According to FiveThirtyEight's congressional vote tracker, as of July 2020 Luria had voted with Donald Trump's stated position 10% of the time. Domestic policy While the federal government was in a partial shutdown, Luria asked for her salary to be withheld until federal workers were paid in January 2019. She participated in a bipartisan group of Representatives seeking to broker a compromise to end the shutdown. Luria favors instituting red flag laws and universal background checks on all gun purchases. In February 2019, Luria introduced the Veterans' Compensation Cost- of-Living Adjustment Act of 2019, which increased the cost of living adjustments (COLAs) made to veterans. It earned bipartisan support and passed in September 2019. Immigration Luria was listed as one of 60 House Democrats who expressed support for some kind of border wall in January 2019. Impeachment In September 2019, Luria labeled herself a \\"security Democrat\\"‚Äîan idiom for freshman Democrats with national security experience‚Äîand called for an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump in an op-ed published by The Washington Post. In an October 2019 town hall meeting held in Virginia Beach, Luria charged that Donald Trump had: \\"Enlist[ed] the help of a foreign leader to influence and malign a potential political opponent to affect the outcome of our next election all under [the] guise of trying to fight corruption.\\" Later in October 2019, Luria formally voted for an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, and she joined all but three Democrats in the House of Representatives to vote for impeachment on both counts: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in December 2019; all Republicans voted no to both charges in the House of Representatives. Environment Luria accepts the scientific consensus on climate change. She is concerned about the physical impacts of climate change on global instability and military readiness. Luria also believes Donald Trump's administration is attempting to discredit military and scientific experts on the physical impacts of climate change, which she views as an aspersion to the national security and scientific apparatuses. In 2019, Luria cosponsored and voted for HR 1941, a ban on offshore drilling in the United States.

McCarty's career as a public servant in Indiana also worked as a deputy attorney general and assistant attorney general for the State of Indiana (1964‚Äì1969), a member of the Indiana Board of Law Examiners (1971‚Äì1976), chief counsel to the Marion County, Indiana, Prosecutor (1975‚Äì1976), and chairman of the Board for the Indiana Department of Correction (1989‚Äì2006). In addition, McCarty co-founded the Indiana Women's Political Caucus and the Greater Indianapolis Women's Political Caucus in 1971 and served as the first president of each organization. As an advocate for women's equality and increasing women's roles in politics and government, McCarty was also involved in the campaign to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment in Indiana in 1977. McCarty, a native of Plainfield, Indiana, and a Phi Beta Kappa member, graduated first in her class from the Indiana University School of Law‚ÄìIndianapolis (the present-day Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law) in 1950 and was a partner in private law practice in Indianapolis. McCarty was a recipient of an honorary J.D. degree from Indiana Central College (the present-day University of Indianapolis) in 1979, and an honorary Doctor of Law degree from IU School of Law‚ÄìIndianapolis, in 1986. In addition to her legal work, McCarty was active in Democratic Party politics in Indiana, but was unsuccessful in her bids for elected office. In 1966 McCarty was the first woman to be nominated by major party for a judgeship in Marion County, Indiana, and in 1976, she was the first woman in Indiana to be nominated for Indiana Attorney General. In 1983, she became first woman candidate to run for the office of Governor of Indiana, but she lost in the Democratic primary in 1984. McCarthy also announced her candidacy for the 1988 Indiana gubernatorial race, but ended her campaign in April 1987 due to insufficient campaign funds.  Early life and education  Virginia Dill was born on December 15, 1924, in Plainfield, Indiana, to Martha Gertrude (Paddack) Dill and Doctor Erasmus Millard Dill.\\"Biographical Sketch\\" in Virginia continued her education at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, where she earned an bachelor's degree in 1946, and earned a bachelor of laws (LL.B.) degree, cum laude, from the Indiana University School of Law‚ÄìIndianapolis (the present-day Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law) in 1950. At IU she became a member of Phi Beta Kappa, graduated first in her law school class, and was elected Indianapolis editor of the Indiana Law Journal. See also: She was the recipient of an honorary J.D. degree from Indiana Central College (the present-day University of Indianapolis) in 1979, and an honorary Doctor of Law degree from IU School of Law‚ÄìIndianapolis in 1986. On April 28, 1946, Virginia Dill married Mendel Oz McCarty. They were the parents of two children: a daughter, Janet McCarty, and son, Michael McCarty. After Mendel McCarty died on March 31, 1973, Virginia Dill McCarty, a working mother, continue her career in law and politics. Career McCarty's career included work as a private practice lawyer, a public servant, and a politician in Indiana. Early years McCarty's first job after completing law school in 1950 was \\"regulating wages and prices\\" at H. P. Wasson and Company, a department store in Indianapolis, Indiana, before she joined the federal Office of Price Stabilization. In 1952, she spent a year working for a title company. In the 1960s and 1970s, McCarty resumed her career following the birth of her two children. In 1965 she began working as deputy attorney general for the State of Indiana and worked as an assistant attorney general from 1966 to 1969. See also: McCarty also served from 1971 to 1976 as a member of the Indiana Board of Law Examiners, and as chief counsel to the Marion County, Indiana, prosecutor from 1975 to 1976. McCarty, a member of the Democratic Party, did not become active in politics until 1965, when she was forty years old. In 1966, McCarty was first woman to be nominated by major party (the Democrats) for a judgeship in Marion County, Indiana, and was nominated again in 1970, but was not elected. In 1976, the Democrats nominated her as the party's candidate for Indiana Attorney General, making McCarty the first woman in Indiana to be nominated for the position. Although she lost the race, McCarty received more votes than any other Democratic candidate since 1968. U.S. District Attorney U.S. Senator Birch Bayh recommended McCarty for U.S. Attorney for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana in February 1977, and U.S. President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the post in June 1977. McCarty served from 1977 to 1981, becoming the first woman to be appointed and serve a full, four-year term as U.S. Attorney. Equal rights advocate In 1971, McCarty co-founded the Indiana Women's Political Caucus and the Greater Indianapolis Women's Political Caucus. She also served as the first president of each organization. The goal of the Indiana Women's Political Caucus, an affiliate of the National Women's Political Caucus, was \\"to advance the status of women through political action.\\"\\"Historical Sketch\\" in Among its primary concern was passage of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), in addition to seeking equal pay and job opportunities for women and involving more women in leadership positions in politics and government. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Indiana Women's Political Caucus achieved some success in getting women elected and appointed to political offices at the state and local levels: Susan Williams was elected to the Indianapolis City-County Council, and later became executive director of the Indiana State Building Commission; Judge Paula E. Lopossa was elected to the Center Township (Indianapolis) Small Claims Court; Judge Patricia A. Riley was elected to the Indiana Court of Appeals; and in the 1984 Indiana gubernatorial election, Ann DeLaney became the first woman nominee for office of Lieutenant Governor of Indiana. McCarty was also involved in the campaign to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment in Indiana in 1977, along with Indiana Women's Political Caucus, the Greater Indianapolis Women's Political Caucus, and others. Although McCarty supported passage of the ERA, she was unsure of its effectiveness in securing equal rights in the private sector. According to McCarty, \\"All it would do was give us equal rights as far as the government was concerned but it wouldn‚Äôt affect private employment at all, I thought. But it became the battleground for the feminists versus the anti-feminists.\\" Candidate for Indiana governor In 1983, at the age of fifty-four, McCarty became first woman candidate to run for the office of Governor of Indiana. McCarty, the second Democrat to declare her candidacy in the 1984 Indiana gubernatorial election, pledged \\"equal justice under law\\" as part of her platform. During her campaign travels throughout the state, McCarty encouraged women and girls to take more active roles in politics and government. McCarty lost in the primary election In 1984 to Wayne Townsend, the Democratic Party's eventual nominee, and Townsend lost in the general election to the Republican incumbent, Governor Robert D. Orr. McCarty also declared her candidacy for Indiana governor for the 1988 Indiana gubernatorial election, but ended her campaign in April 1987 due to insufficient campaign funds. Indiana Secretary of State Evan Bayh became the Democratic Party's nominee and went on to defeat Indiana lieutenant governor John Mutz, the Republican Party's nominee, in the general election.) Private practice lawyer McCarty was a partner in the law firm of Dillon, McCarty, Hardamon and Cohen in Indianapolis from 1969 until 1977. After her term as U.S. Attorney ended in 1981, she returned to Indianapolis and resumed her private practice, working as a partner with the Landman Beatty law firm until her death in 2006. Later years In addition to practicing law in Indianapolis, McCarty served in her later years as chairman of the Board for the Indiana Department of Correction from 1989 until 2006. Death and legacy McCarty died on May 26, 2006, in Indianapolis, Indiana, at the age of eighty-one. McCarty's career in law and public service included her appointment as the first woman to serve a full, four-year term as U.S. Attorney. She was a champion of women's rights and an advocate of equality and equal pay for women.

MacLean was an American physician and neuroscientist who formulated his model in the 1960s, which was published in his own 1990 book The Triune Brain in Evolution. MacLean's three-part theory explores how the human brain has evolved from ancestors over millions of years, consisting of the reptilian, paleomammalian and neomammalian complexes. MacLean proposes that the neomammalian complex is only found in higher order mammals, for example, the human brain, accounting for increased cognitive ability such as motor control, memory, improved reasoning and complex decision-making. MacLean's theory explores how in higher order mammals, the Neomammalian brain works interdependently with the Reptilian and Paleomammalian complexes to allow sophisticated thought processes to occur. The theory of the Neomammalian brain is based on MacLean's vast research conducted through comparing the structural differences between human brains and other organisms, including monkeys and a range of reptiles. MacLean's research was built upon previous neuroscience researchers' findings, including James Papez, which led to the formulation of the Triune Theory of the Human Brain and the limbic system, the two major contributions that MacLean made to the faculty of neuroscience. Paul MacLean Paul Donald MacLean Paul Donald MacLean was an American physician and neuroscientist who was born in Phelps, New York, on May 1, 1913, into a Presbyterian minister's family, thus, ultimately becoming a religious man himself. MacLean married Alison Stokes and lived in Mitchellville, Maryland, with their five children Alison, Alexander, David, James and Paul. MacLean died in Potomac, Maryland, in 2007, aged 94. MacLean is famous for his significant contributions to brain research, psychiatry and physiology. He spent a large amount of his working life at Yale Medical School and the National Institutes of Health, where through his research he was able to publish neuroscience texts, reports, photographs and audio-visual material on his neurological findings. MacLean spent two years during World War 2 serving as a medical officer for the Yale Unit, which later became known as the 39th General Hospital. This experience helped to shape MacLean's perspective on the impacts of post-traumatic stress disorder on fallen soldiers, which would ultimately shape his future studies into the way the human brain functions and how it can be easily damaged through life experiences, with particular focus on sleeping disorders and other mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. MacLean had a deep fascination with the natural human instinct, and the role that the brain plays with rational human thinking. MacLean believed that there was a connection between a human's violent actions and rational behaviour. In addition, MacLean coined the idea of the limbic system, the set of brain structures that surround the hypothalamus and are responsible for human emotions, memories and arousal. The research made by MacLean was based on previous studies by Dr James Papez, a neuroscientist who during the 1930s and 1940s delved into the circuit between the hippocampus, thalamus and cingulum, and how their connection is the basis for human emotion. MacLean proposed that the limbic system had developed over time in early mammals to control both fight and flight responses. MacLeans findings and proposals on the limbic system are both still questioned and debated by modern-day neuroscience researchers, failing to conclude whether MacLeans‚Äô proposal is of accuracy. Structure The Triune Brain is divided into three sections: Reptilian, Paleomammalian and Neomammalian. MacLean proposed that the human skull doesn't just contain one single brain, according to his Triune Brain Theory, it in fact holds three. These three separate brains work interdependently, interconnected by nerves, each of which operate differently with different capacities.  Reptilian  The Reptilian Brain was referred to by MacLean as the ‚ÄòR Complex‚Äô or the primitive brain. This is the oldest brain in the Triune Theory and anatomically is made up of the brain stem and the cerebellum. In reptiles, both the brain stem and cerebellum dominate and are the control centres for basic function. It has been found that these two parts of the brain are responsible for emotions such as paranoia, obsession and compulsion. Further, being essential in regulating heart rate, body temperature and space orientation. For example, if a human holds their breath and carbon dioxide levels rise, the primitive brain initiates the lungs to start breathing to achieve a state of homeostasis.  Paleomammalian  The Paleomammalian brain is known as the intermediate or ‚Äòold mammalian‚Äô brain. The Paleomammalian brain anatomically consists of the hypothalamus, amygdala and the hippocampus. It is responsible for subconscious emotions such as fear, joy, fighting and sexual behaviour. The old mammalian brain is found in a large percentage of mammals and is believed to have a strong intricate connection with the neocortex. MacLeans idea of the ‚Äòlimbic system‚Äô is based on the role the paleomammalian brain plays in brain function, where an individual's judgement of right and wrong stems from. MacLean had a particular influence on the role that the limbic system plays on mental health when it translates messages incorrectly, for example, how an individual can enter a state of deep distress when there is no stimuli to cause such a response, relating directly to MacLeans research into the causes of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Neomammalian  The neomammalian brain consists of the cerebral neocortex, which is found in higher mammals, especially in the human brain, and is not found in birds or reptiles. The neomammalian brains structure is of great complexity, and has evolved over time allowing humans to reach the top of the food chain. The neocortex is made up of grey matter consisting of folds to increase the surface area and memory retention, these folds in humans are 80% excitatory and 20% inhibitory. The arrangement of these folds differs from human to human, and is believed to account for the differing cognitive abilities of individual humans. It has been found by neuroscientists that the cerebral neocortex accounts for roughly 76% of the human brains total volume. The neocortex is predominately associated with high order brain functions such as motor control, sensory perception and cognition. The neocortex can be divided into two sections; the proisocortex and the true isocortex. The Proisocortex is transitional between both the true isocotex and periallocortex, it can be found mainly in the cingulate gyrus, insula and the subcallosal areas of the brain. The true isocortex is a six layered cytoarchitecture that is predominately located in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe and occipital lobe. Another unique feature of the neocortex is the way in which the matter is arranged together in columns. In the human brain, the six neocortex layers are 2.5mm thick which contain thousands of different types of cells. Neuroscientists over the many years of research have struggled greatly to reach an agreed conclusion as to why the Neocortex is arranged in such a way; however, many suggest that the columns act as channels for intricate communication between cells and differing layers, this is believed to be another neurological explanation as to why higher order mammals have such a complex order of thinking in comparison to lower-order mammals, reptiles and birds. Brain-layers Development The neomammalian brain (neocortex) is the newest addition to the Human Brain. MacLean proposed that as animals evolved over the hundreds of millions of years, in order for an increased chance of survival, higher order animals developed an increased cognitive ability, which resulted in an increase in brain size. Lecerveau. (1999). The Triune Brain . Available: https://lecerveau.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/articles_pdf/triunebrain.pdf MacLean firmly believed that the driving force in the development of the neocortex was the development of social behaviours, such as the separation cry between infant and mother during the development phase of offspring. It followed the idea that mammals evolved through learning about different methods of survival, as these mammals learnt various methods of survival through particular encounters, their brains developed into far more complex cytoarchitectures. MacLeans model is based on the idea of the larger the brain size, the higher the order of thinking, thus, an increased cognitive ability. The neomammalian brain is in charge of all ‚Äòrational thinking‚Äô, his model follows Charles Darwin's natural selection idea of ‚Äôsurvival of the fittest‚Äô, where those mammals that developed characteristics of the neomammalian brain survived and then passed this trait onto their offspring, until a stage was reached where the majority of the population of higher order mammals attained the survival trait, a process that occurred over millions and millions of years. Archaeologists have discovered and are still discovering fossil records that allow comparative anatomy to occur between the modern-day Homo Sapien and primate ancestors. The tissue that the human brain is made up of decomposes once the organism has died, so old brain tissue cannot be analysed, however, due to the large percentage that the neomammalian brain takes up in the human brain, estimated to be 76%, comparative anatomy shows that the Homo Sapien has a much larger cranial size then early primate ancestors. It must be noted that many neuroscientists believe that MacLean's theory of the Triune Theory is false, however, what is a mutual agreement between the majority of neuroscientists, is that the features that McLean has described of the neomammalian brain is the reason as to why humans have such a high-level order of thinking. Clinical significance Through comparing the three different sections of MacLean's Triune Theory, neuroscientists have been able to account for the complexity of the human brain in comparison to reptiles, birds and other lower order mammals. Animal scientists have dissected a vast array of organism's brains and through comparison ultimately concluded that the cerebral cortex (neomammalian Brain) has a different column structure to other organisms‚Äô. The discovery of the six layered neomammalian brain has allowed neuroscientists to research into their differing roles, and how each function interdependently to allow for complex thought to occur. The six layers have been separated into three different sections according to the role they play in the survival of a human. Layers one to three are referred to as the supragranular layers and play a vital role in the origin and termination of intercortical connections. Layer one is known as the molecular layer and is made up of very few nerve cells. Layer two is the external granular layer that is made up small, dense neurons. Layer three is the pyramidal layer and is made up larger pyramidal shaped neurons. These three layers are composed of pyramidal cells, cells that have a pyramidal shaped axon with long dendrites connecting to other cells in neighbouring columns. The second section of the neomammalian brain is the Internal Granular Layer, and is known as layer four by neuroscientists; this layer is responsible for receiving afferent signals from the hypothalamus and sends messages to the other layers. For example, layer four would receive messages about external temperature changes. The Internal Granular Layer acts as a medium which receives, processes and the sends signals to other parts of the brain, allowing the body to respond in such a way to combat the change in environment. The final section is composed of layers five and six and is known as the infragranular layers; it connects the cerebral cortex with the subcortical regions of the brain, these regions are responsible for long-term memory, motor control and behavioural and emotional responses. Damages to layers five and six can be detrimental to the overall fitness of the mammal, usually resulting in some form of retardation or loss in cognitive processes. These six layers of the neomammalian brain work interdependently to process neurological messages at an extremely fast and high-quality level. These six layers are only found in the modern day human brain; however, other higher order mammals have features of these layers that give allow them to have a high cognitive processing ability.

He served as the superintendent of Seattle Public Schools from 1901 until 1922, where he was known as a progressive administrator who introduced updated instruction methods and raised teacher pay in order to recruit teachers from across the nation. His program of building schools that were tightly integrated into their neighborhoods helped shape Seattle into a city known for its distinctive, cohesive neighborhoods. He also served as superintendent in Des Moines, Iowa, and Salt Lake City.  Early life and family  Cooper was born in Mount Morris Township, Illinois on September 17, 1855, to blacksmith William Thomas Cooper and Barbara Theophania Wallace. He attended high school in Polo, Illinois, and worked as a news butcher on trains and as a mule driver in order to earn money for further education, with the aim of becoming a lawyer. He accepted a teaching position at age seventeen, and a year later became the principal of a two-room school, a position which he held for a year. Cooper studied at Cornell University for one year, from 1878 to 1879, and decided to shift his career aspirations from law to education. He married Martha M. \\"Mattie\\" Hazeltine of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, in Polo on August 24, 1880. The couple had two daughters, Phania and Ruth, and two sons, John and William. William was aboard the SS Tuscania when it was sunk by a German U-boat in 1918, but he survived. Martha died in Seattle on June 14, 1916, after a lengthy illness. Cooper remarried in 1920, to Margaret Curtis, formerly of Los Angeles.  Career  Cooper worked as a superintendent of public schools in two cities in Iowa, in Salt Lake City, Utah, and in Seattle, Washington. In each of the three states, he also served as president of the state's teachers' association and on the state board of education. He was a devotee of the progressive principles of education reformer John Dewey. He served as the president of the National Education Association's Department of Superintendence in 1908, having previously been the department's secretary in 1901 and its vice-president in 1898.  Iowa (1883‚Äì1899)  Cooper served as the superintendent of public schools in Le Mars, Iowa, from 1883 to 1890. From 1890 to 1891, he was a professor of pedagogy at the State University of Iowa (now known as the University of Iowa), after which he took the position of superintendent in Des Moines beginning in 1891. Cooper served as president of the Iowa State Teachers' Association in 1893 and used his position to argue for more rigorous training of teachers in the state. He observed that \\"it is a well-known fact, not flattering to be sure, that a first grade certificate in Iowa is about equal in grade to the second-class certificate in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Minnesota, and other sister states.\\" In March 1899 he traveled to Salt Lake City for an interview with the school board for the superintendent position there.  Salt Lake City (1899‚Äì1901)  Salt Lake City superintendent of schools Jesse F. Millspaugh had resigned his position in Salt Lake City early in his two-year term in December 1898. The debate over who should replace him reinflamed past tension between Mormons and non-Mormons on the school board and in the community, with newspapers carrying on editorial debates over whether Mormon candidates would even be considered due a perceived bias on the non-Mormon-majority board. On April 11, 1899, the board offered the job to Cooper, a Congregationalist, by a vote of 6 to 4 along sectarian lines, with the minority asserting that Cooper's lack of a formal degree disqualified him and that the other candidate, Joshua H. Paul, lost only because of his Mormon faith. Cooper was able to soothe the tension and the following year, on June 13, 1900, he was unanimously re-appointed for a full term. The city of Seattle asked him in 1900 to become its superintendent, but he declined in order to serve out his term in Salt Lake City. A smallpox outbreak later that year prompted the health board to mandate that unvaccinated children be kept home from school, leading to another rift between the Mormon and non-Mormon blocs of the school board. Although only a small minority of church leaders were opposed to vaccination, one of them, Charles W. Penrose, used his position as editor of the Deseret News to promote the view that the authorities had no right to mandate vaccination. The school board voted to allow the unvaccinated children into school in defiance of the health board, lawsuits ensued, and Cooper was put in the position of needing to decide which orders his employees should obey. After the board denied his request to address them about his concerns, he objected he \\"never again\\" wanted to be on a board where he was not allowed to speak and was told he \\"might not have the opportunity\\". When Seattle's offer was repeated again in early 1901, he accepted.  Seattle (1901‚Äì1930)  Cooper took over as superintendent of Seattle Public Schools in 1901 following the resignation of Frank J. Barnard. For much of his time in Seattle, his progressive approach to education meshed well with the attitude of the school board and public, but following World War I, he clashed with an increasingly conservative board.  Expansion and innovation  In Seattle, Cooper oversaw an expansion in both the number of grammar schools and the scope of their curriculum. He envisioned them as centers for both the students and the community, and expanded class offerings beyond a core curriculum to include art and music, physical education, gardening, and manual training programs for students at risk of dropping out. He championed the use of teaching techniques that required students to research and discuss topics aloud rather than perform rote memorization. Cooper took personal responsibility for hiring teachers, and hired them from all over the country. By 1910, a quarter of the city's teachers had a bachelor's degree, and a half had a two-year normal school degree. He instituted a school medical program which grew to include a medical and dental clinic and baby-care classes, and added special education classes for students with learning or physical disabilities. Enrollment in high schools in Seattle increased from 872 to 10,885 over the course of Cooper's tenure, and the system as a whole grew from 21 buildings for 10,017 pupils to 98 buildings for 42,241. He instituted a program of teaching English to the foreign-born parents of children in the school and felt that \\"any really effective scheme of Americanization must include reaching the home of foreign people using a language other than English, in our community, and one influential means of reaching such homes is by way of the mothers and through the cooperation of the children attending American schools from those homes\\". He also fought against a plan floated by the school board to have a permanently segregated building for teaching of foreign students, arguing that they should instead be integrated into the regular classes as soon as their English skills warranted.  Conflict and resignation  Cooper's progressive approach to education led to some tension within the community, particularly as its more conservative elements gained influence throughout World War I. A state law passed in 1915 required the performance of flag exercises at all public gatherings, including public schools. Cooper disliked the formalized flag exercises the law called for, saying that to implement it literally would be \\"perfunctory and tasteless.\\" He argued that teachers be allowed to present more symbolic exercises that taught the meaning of the principles the flag stood for, which caused conflict with organizations including the Daughters of the American Revolution that were trying to ensure that a more rigorous program of patriotism be taught in schools. In early 1918, Cooper attempted to defend the teaching of German in schools, saying, \\"aversion to and detestation of things German may carry us to unreasonable and reactionary limits\\", but relented in the face of public pressure and removed it from the curriculum that April. The following year, the board rescinded its approval of a series of history textbooks that had been deemed too pro-German, and also fired a high school teacher, Charles Neiderhauser, for an alleged lack of patriotism. Beginning in 1916, Cooper had pushed for more administrative power for his office, but the school board instead reorganized the system in 1919 to make him just one of six department heads. A group called the Tax Reduction Council (or TRC) began attacking Cooper both professionally and personally, arguing that he had spent too much money building schools and offering unnecessary classes and extracurricular activities, and calling for him to be replaced by a younger superintendent. The board decided to hire no new teachers for the 1921‚Äì1922 year and laid off some current ones for the first time, and Cooper refused to participate in recommending further budget cuts. The original Frank B. Cooper Elementary School, built in 1917. Cooper submitted his resignation on March 17, 1922, effective August 1, though after the board passed further budget cuts, he took an early leave in June, and assistant superintendent Thomas R. Cole succeeded him.  Later life  Cooper was appointed to the Washington State Board of Education to succeed W. F. Geiger, taking office on June 17, 1921, and serving until he was succeeded by George B. Miller on May 1, 1923. After retiring, Cooper bought a ten-acre estate in Lake Forest Park. He died there on November 23, 1930, after a brief illness.  Legacy and memorials  The Frank B. Cooper Scholarship Fund, for \\"needy and worthy students,\\" was raised by representatives of Seattle public schools after his retirement in 1922. Frank B. Cooper Elementary School in the Delridge district of Seattle was renamed from the Youngstown School in honor of Cooper in 1939. The school itself moved to a new building in 1999; the original building, built during Cooper's tenure and now the home of the Youngstown Cultural Arts Center, is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Composition The coalition included the Guardians of Religion Organization, Ansar al-Din Front, and Ansar al-Islam. All of the individual organizations in the group have rejected the Sochi agreement. Ansar al-Tawhid left the group on 3 May 2020. History On 24 October 2018, the operation room shelled multiple Syrian military positions in the town of Jurin in the Hama Governorate with SPG-9 recoilless guns. In response, the Syrian Army shelled a town controlled by the operation room 10 km north of Jurin. On 28 October 2018, the group published a video near al-Zahraa in the Aleppo Governorate of a sniping operation being carried out against pro-government militiamen. On 27 November 2018, a video was released by the coalition showing fighters attacking government positions and gunning down pro-government militiamen in their quarters and taking their weapons. On 7 January 2019, the operation room published a statement rejecting infighting between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the National Front for Liberation calling on both parties to cease fighting and resolve their issues in an independent Sharia court while also stressing the importance of fighting the Syrian government. On 27 August 2019, Rouse the Believers conducted a counter-offensive in southern Idlib targeting the Syrian government's positions near the town of Atshan. The Syrian Army reported repelling the attack shortly thereafter. Rebel forces reported taking over the villages of al-Salloumiyah, Sham al-Hawa, Tell Maraq and Al-Jaduiyah later in the day. SOHR confirmed that al-Sullaumiyah and Abu Omar had been recaptured by opposition forces and that some advances were made on Sham al- Hawa, while clashes over the rest of the villages continued. Later on the same day, SOHR reported that the rebel groups had withdrawn from the positions where they had taken earlier in the southeastern countryside of Idlib. On 31 August 2019, the U.S. carried out a series of airstrikes on a Rouse the Believers meeting between Kafriya and Maarrat Misrin, killing over 40 Guardians of Religion Organization militants, including several leaders. On 12 June 2020, member groups of the Rouse the Believers Operations Room, excluding Ansar al-Tawhid who had a falling-out with the Guardians of Religion Organization, and in addition to two other Salafi jihadist groups (named Tansiqiyat al-Jihad and Liwa al-Muqatileen al-Ansar) led by former HTS commanders, reorganized themselves into a new operations room called \\"So Be Steadfast\\".

History In 1928, Morrison P. Bridgland suggested the name Mount Huntington for the mountain, but it was not adopted. However, the Huntington name endures as the name of the Huntington Glacier below the eastern aspect of the summit. The mountain was instead named Cirrus Mountain, and that became official in 1935. The first ascent of the mountain was accomplished in 1939 by C.B. Sissons, H.J. Sissons. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Cirrus Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. The east aspect of Cirrus Mountain is covered by expansive glacial ice known as the Huntington Glacier. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Cirrus Mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below -30 ¬∞C.

It was formerly the Hollywood Casino Jamul-San Diego. The president and general manager is Mary Cheeks. The casino has 1,700 slot machines and 40 table games. It is located 20 miles east of downtown San Diego. History In 1999, the Tipai Band of Kumeyaay Indians, with 64 members living on of sovereign land in the Jamul area designated the \\"Jamul Indian Village,\\" announced their intent to develop a new hotel and casino. The original plan, which required the US government to annex of surrounding land to complete the project, met with strong opposition from local residents. After the annexation effort was denied, the casino plan was revised to fit the reservation grounds. Despite continuing opposition from townspeople, a ceremonial groundbreaking took place on December 10, 2005. The $200 million project was financed by Lakes Entertainment of Minnesota. The casino's original concept was to be developed according to the State of California's gambling compact. Proponents emphasize increased revenue for the state and the tribe, as well as 2,000 new jobs for all members of the community, while opponents fear strain on its police and fire services, a major impact on the local water supply, and argue that a 15-story building would permanently change the town's character. The chief concern is the increased traffic on the main road through the town, Highway 94. The proposed casino location is such that all the traffic to and from would likely pass through the middle of the town. On February 7, 2003, the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs held a meeting to discuss the environmental impact report produced by the Jamul Indian Tribe in support of the casino project. Hundreds of Jamul residents showed up to express almost unanimous opposition to the casino. On September 13, 2006, casino organizers held a meeting with the townspeople on site to address their concerns. The casino plan was further clarified, with an artist's conception of the proposed six- story casino and 12-story hotel complex on display. A court reporter was on hand to receive comments for or against the proposal, and of the 40 who did so, three were in favor. Most of the negative comments were in regard to increased traffic on California State Route 94, which narrows to a two-lane road at the proposed site of casino. On March 10, 2007, the tribe evicted three residents (not tribal members) who had been living on the Indian Village land but who opposed the casino: Karen Toggery and her son and Walter Rosales. Locals gathered to protest the evictions. The Tribe hired a local security company and \\"deputized\\" them as \\"Jamul Tribal Police.\\" These guards then utilized pepper spray and metal batons on some of the protestors who trespassed onto Tribal property and refused to leave. Tribal chairman Leon Acebedo signed an agreement witnessed by local Board of Supervisors member Dianne Jacob that stipulated that the homes of the evicted would not be destroyed for at least seven days. Their homes were demolished two days later, leading to considerable controversy in the community. An unrelated statement was released that same day stating that the tribal leaders no longer wished to negotiate with the state regarding the casino and were planning a casino with Class II games only, which do not include slot machines, as casinos with only Class II games are not governed by compacts with the State of California. On October 1, 2008, the tribe sued Caltrans after months of unsuccessful negotiations. The tribe claimed their sovereignty gives them the right to use the land that they see fit. Caltrans maintained that they represent the public‚Äôs safety and that they would not approve the permits to put a stoplight in the middle of State Route 94 unless more environmental impact studies (EIR) were performed. The tribe continued to maintain that Caltrans‚Äô preferred, safe alternative of building a driveway off a side road, Melody Lane, was ‚Äúimproper meddling by the state‚Äù. In the article cited above, a member of the tribe's Executive Council, Carlene Chamberlain, stated ‚ÄúThe Minnesota company backing the casino, Lakes Entertainment, can't get funding for design and construction until it's clear that gamblers will be able to get to the slot machines.‚Äù During Lakes Entertainment's review of their 2008 results on March 12, 2009, they indicated that the Jamul Indian Tribe and Caltrans' had reached an understanding and that the Jamul Indian Tribe had agreed to create an EIR for the revised project. Lakes indicated also that the project would be re- evaluated in light of the financial environment and would be monitored closely. Although Lakes did say they would not abandon the project completely, they reduced the \\"fair market value\\" of the project by 80%. In addition, Lakes revised their estimate of when the project could be completed to 2014. On March 13, 2012 Lakes Entertainment cancelled their development contract with the Jamul Indian Tribe. Immediately following that, the tribe announced plans to work with the community to design a smaller facility that addressed many of the Jamul resident's concerns. Finding a new partner for this development was made more difficult because of the $57 million the tribe owed Lakes from the previous development as well as the fact that the tribe only had authorization to run a Class II gaming facility from the government, having turned down the terms and conditions of a Class III gaming facility from the state. Penn National Gaming became the developer, lender and manager of the $400 million Hollywood Casino in collaboration with the Jamul Indian Village. Hollywood Casino Jamul ‚Äì San Diego opened on October 10, 2016. The casino includes a three-story gaming and entertainment facility of approximately 200,000 square feet, featuring over 1,700 slot machines, 40 live table games, multiple restaurants, bars and lounges and an enclosed below grade parking structure with approximately 1,800 spaces. In May 2018, the Penn National Gaming Corp., which owns the Hollywood casinos chain of 27 gambling properties, deflagged the casino and handed over management of it to the Jamul Indian Village Development Corp.

Thus, it can be seen as the generalization of a difference set, the set of distances (and their negations) in collections of numbers. Several problems and results in geometry concern distance sets, usually based on the principle that a large collection of points must have a large distance set (for varying definitions of \\"large\\"): *Falconer's conjecture is the statement that, for a collection of points in d-dimensional space that has Hausdorff dimension larger than d/2, the corresponding distance set has nonzero Lebesgue measure. Although partial results are known, the conjecture remains unproven. *The Erd≈ës‚ÄìUlam problem asks whether it is possible to have a dense set in the Euclidean plane whose distance set consists only of rational numbers. Again, it remains unsolved. *Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares characterizes the numbers in the distance set of the two-dimensional integer lattice: they are the square roots of integers whose prime factorization does not contain an odd number of copies of any prime congruent to 3 mod 4. Analogously, Legendre's three-square theorem characterizes the distance set of the three-dimensional integer lattice, and Lagrange's four-square theorem characterizes the distance set of integer lattices in four and higher dimensions as being the square roots of integers without any additional constraints. In lattices of five or more dimensions, every subset of the lattice with nonzero upper density has a distance set containing the squares of an infinite arithmetic progression. *According to the Erd≈ës‚ÄìAnning theorem, every infinite set of points in the Euclidean plane that does not lie on one line has a non-integer in its distance set. *Square grids of points have distance sets of sublinear size, in contrast to points in general position whose distance set is quadratic in size. However, according to the 2015 solution of the Erd≈ës distinct distances problem by Larry Guth and Nets Katz, the distance set of any finite collection of points in the Euclidean plane is only slightly sublinear, nearly as large as the given collection. In particular, only a finite collection of points can have a finite distance set. *A Golomb ruler is a finite set of points on a line such that no two pairs of points have the same distance. Sophie Piccard claimed that no two Golomb rulers have the same distance sets. The claim is incorrect, but there is only one counterexample, a pair of six-point Golomb rulers with a shared distance set. *The equilateral dimension of a metric space is the largest size of a collection of points whose distance set has only a single element. Kusner's conjecture states that the equilateral dimension of a d-dimensional space with the Manhattan distance is exactly 2d, but this remains unproven. Distance sets have also been used as a shape descriptor in computer vision.

He was best known for his proficiency in realism. Rock‚Äôs work can be found in art collections around the world. Biography Geoffrey Rock was born in 1923 in Birmingham, England. Rock was the son of his 17-year-old mother. As a young boy, Rock demonstrated artistic talent. He left home at the age of fourteen and attended the Birmingham College of Art as a gratis student, sitting in on classes. One day during roll call, a professor discovered Geoffrey‚Äôs artwork and accepted him into the school free of charge due to his exceptional talent. Upon completing his studies, Rock moved away to London, England where he became an apprentice for an advertising firm and attended the London Central School of Art. Eventually, he began doing commercial art work for the advertising firm. Also while in London, Geoffrey met his future wife Joan, a Welsh woman from Cardiff who was working as the personal secretary to Lord Beaverbrook. They were married in 1942. A short time later, Geoffrey Rock entered World War II as a ‚Äúwar artist‚Äù, painting portraits of superior officers and sketching depictions of battle scenes. Rock was present for the D-Day landings at Normandy on June 6th, 1944. When the war ended, he returned to London and worked as an assistant to Sir James Gunn, who did portraits of the British Royal Family. Rock worked under Gunn for five years. As an assistant, one of Rock‚Äôs paintings entitled ‚ÄúSt. George‚Äôs Chapel‚Äù drew the attention of Queen Elizabeth II, who decided to use it for her official annual Christmas card of 1954. It was also during this time that Rock‚Äôs wife gave birth to a daughter, Deborah, and son, Nigel. In 1956, the Rock family emigrated to Montreal, Canada. Shortly thereafter, Geoffrey‚Äôs wife gave birth to their third child, Christopher. The Rock family spent time moving throughout Canada before settling into an old farmer‚Äôs home in Cheltenham, Ontario. The family spent twelve years here before moving west to Pender Island, British Columbia. While in British Columbia, Geoffrey was able to turn his full attention to his work, which led him to opening a studio in West Vancouver. In the years following, Rock would continue to hone his craft and gain recognition through various art shows and exhibits. Geoffrey Rock died August 31, 2000.\\"Geoffrey Rock\\" entry in \\"Artists of Canada\\" Database (Government of Canada) Record Number: 14065 Style and influences As a young boy, Geoffrey Rock would often visit the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, where he would spend hours studying each painting individually. He became particularly influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite painters Holman Hunt, Burne-Jones, and Ford Madox Brown. Rock‚Äôs study of these painters allowed him to develop his own realistic style of painting. In a 1981 publication of Arts West magazine, Geoffrey Rock described his creative process by stating, ‚ÄúI use reality as a starting point, but project on the canvas my most intimate reaction to the subject. I spend hours searching for the right subject; it has to strike a particular creative chord. I give my work total concentration‚Ä¶ I enter a trance-like state, and it is hard to come back to reality. Painting is exhausting, demanding, and at times frustrating but in the long run an intensely satisfying occupation.‚Äù Legacy Geoffrey Rock held a number of solo art shows throughout his career at various locations including: Yellow Door Gallery (Winnipeg), Art Gallery of Windsor (Windsor), Gainsborough Gallery (Calgary), Galerie Sherbrook (Montreal), Art Emporium (Vancouver) and Backroom Gallery (Victoria). Additionally, Rock held multiple shows at the following locations: Pollock Gallery (Toronto), Alex Fraser Gallery (Vancouver), and Laing Art Gallery (Toronto). The work of Geoffrey Rock has been represented in collections throughout Canada and the United States. Geoffrey‚Äôs youngest son, Christopher Rock, followed in his father‚Äôs footsteps and has become a painter in Victoria, British Columbia.

She is a direct descendant of Martha Washington from her first marriage to Daniel Parke Custis.  Biography  Eleanor Parke Custis was born in 1897. She never married and lived most of her life in Washington, D.C. After the death of her father, with whom she lived till 1960, she moved to Gloucester, Massachusetts.  Career  Eleanor Parke Custis studied in Corcoran School of the Arts and Design under Edmund C. Tarbell and Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts with Henry B. Snell. Initially, she began her art career as a painter, creating watercolors. Custis created illustrations for Scribner's Magazine, Harper's, Doubleday, Harcourt. She started to take photographs in her youth, using a Brownie camera, switching to professional photography in the 1930s, following a trip abroad. Eleanor Parke Custis used The bromoil process, invented in 1907, bleaching a print on bromide paper in order to remove the blackened silver. The areas of a picture that need to be dark are then painted using a brush. Custis studied at the Corcoran School of Art with Edmund Tarbell and Henry B. Snell. She was a member of the American Watercolor Society, the Boston Art Club, National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and other art associations. In 1935 Eleanor Parke Custis wrote and illustrated a photography book - \\"Composition and Pictures\\". Custis' technique is different from many other American pictorialists. She made her images softly focused, using a \\"Flou-Net\\" enlarging diffuser, invented by Belgian pictorialist L√©onard Misonne. This technique produced dark halos along the edges of shadowed areas, creating a romantic effect which was well suited to the travel photographs she made in Europe and South America.  Exhibitions  Eleanor Parke Custis participated in more than 880 exhibitions during her lifetime. She had several exhibitions in Grand Central Art Galleries in New York City.

It was published in August 2018 by I.B. Tauris. The book addresses what Hitchens regards as the national myth of the Second World War, which he believes dealt long-term damage to Britain and its position in the world. He argues that while the allies were, indeed, fighting a radical evil, they sometimes used immoral methods, such as the allies‚Äô carpet bombing of German civilians. He believes that Britain's entry into World War II led to its rapid decline after the war. This was because, among other things, it could not finance the war and was not prepared. As a result, it had to surrender much of its wealth and power to avoid bankruptcy. However, Hitchens does not make a universal anti- war case because he believes that this position often leaves countries unprotected and defenceless in times of war. Instead, he argues that military power and the threat of war can be necessary deterrents against war. Reception The book was negatively reviewed by Richard J. Evans, former Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge, in the New Statesman. Evans described the book as being \\"riddled with errors\\" and reliant \\"on a handful of eccentric studies\\". Daniel Johnson writing in Standpoint disagreed with many of the claims made in the book, and compared it negatively to the recent book Churchill: Walking with Destiny, which Johnson said refuted Hitchens' \\"claim that the whole conflict was unnecessary\\".

It was initially released as a single backed with \\"Titti\\". Both songs were recorded during the initial sessions for De Andr√©'s self-titled 1981 album (also known as L'Indiano) and first released in 1980 as a standalone single. In 1999, \\"Una storia sbagliata\\" was re-released within the Fabrizio De Andr√©: Opere complete box set.In spite of its title, the box is actually far from complete, as it only includes De Andr√©'s thirteen official studio albums, as well as a two-track CD single featuring \\"Il pescatore\\" and \\"Una storia sbagliata\\". De Andr√©'s live albums, all of his early production originally released on the Karim label, Mina's virtual duet with De Andr√© on \\"La canzone di Marinella\\" and \\"Titti\\" are not included in the box. \\"Titti\\" had its first CD release in 2005, within the greatest hits and rarities collection In direzione ostinata e contraria.

It features an arrangement led by layered acoustic and electric strummed guitars, and mostly sung in close harmony by De Andr√© and co-writer Bubola. Written on a commission from RAI as an end-credits song for the 1980 documentary Dietro il processo (\\"Behind the trial\\") by journalist Franco Biancacci,Riccardo Venturi's commentary (in Italian and English) on Anti-War Songs it is a topical song about the mysterious, unsolved 1975 murder of writer, poet and film director Pier Paolo Pasolini. (Ennio Morricone wrote original music for the documentary.) Details about Ennio Morricone's involvement, on www.chimai.com The lyrics do not specifically talk about the event but refer to it as a forgettable, untold, complex, peripheral, unfinished, black-coloured, badly covered-up, disgraced, and, ultimately, wrong story. All of the above adjectives, and more, are used in the verses of the song. Each is used in a single anaphoric line as a modifier of \\"story\\", while the chorus refers to the story itself as either different for ordinary people or as an ordinary one for special people. In the second chorus, \\"story\\" is replaced by \\"night\\", and the choruses mention two lives tainted, hit and sculpted by heaven. According to an interview with Bubola in the final DVD (Poesia in forma di canzone ‚Äì \\"Poetry as songs\\") of the 8-DVD 2011 documentary series Dentro Faber (De Andr√©'s nickname) about his life and works, he and De Andr√© accurately chose the word \\"Heaven\\", instead of \\"God\\", in order not to wrap a religious vision into the song, per De Andr√©'s wishes. Bubola also explained the \\"two lives\\" line as a reference to the fact that the original RAI documentary (for which the song was written) was also about the unsolved murder of 21-year-old aspiring actress Wilma Montesi.Dentro Faber, DVD 8: Poesia in forma di canzone. \\"Titti\\" \\"Titti\\" [a nickname for the female names Tiziana or Elisabetta] is a happy-sounding Tejano song, set in time at an allegro moderato tempo of about 120 BPM and again featuring acoustic strummed guitars (similarly to \\"Andrea\\", from Rimini, but harsher and less melodic than its predecessor). The lyrics are mostly whimsical and, except for the chorus, do not tell a consistent story. Indeed, the titular Titti appears only in the chorus, which was inspired by Jorge Amado's 1966 fantasy novel Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands. In a lightweight tone, De Andr√© sings about a carefree woman named Titti who \\"had two loves, one of heaven, one of earth; of opposite sign, one of peace, one of war\\" and, in the second half of the chorus, \\"one on earth, one in heaven, [...] a good one, a true one\\". The verses, on the other hand, consist in a series of unconnected images about pairs (or couples) of objects and people, each pair/couple being linked only by a common object or a common place. Two such lines, \\"And it was two wooden beams which made up the cross Original Italian line: \\"E furono i due legni che fecero la croce\\". The word croce (i.e. cross) is not capitalized in the original lyrics./and, around it, two bandits with the same voice\\", may be read as a biblical reference to the two thieves crucified alongside Jesus Commentary by Dennis Criteser, as above., but also as an allusion to De Andre's notorious 1979 kidnapping by Anonima sarda, as the bandits who talked to him were actually two, and undistinguishable. The song is one of De Andr√©'s least-known: he considered it very irrelevant and has never promoted it, nor has he commented on it. Co-writer Bubola, however, on Dentro Faber, mentioned it en passant as \\"just a B-side\\", and explained that the name \\"Titti\\" was preferred to his original choice of \\"Flora\\" ‚Äì from the title of Amado's novel ‚Äì as \\"Titti\\" had a more percussive sound (thus fitting better into the music of the song and its chorus), without caring at all about any possible significance of either name.Dentro Faber, DVD 8. Personnel According to Bubola, both sides of the single feature unspecified members of Premiata Forneria Marconi and New Trolls, in what the songwriter referred to as \\"a sort of jam session\\". Later on, during a TV interview to promote New Trolls' 2013 album Concerto Grosso N¬∞ 3, where the then-current band was billed as La Leggenda New Trolls due to an ongoing lawsuit involving former guitarist Ricky Belloni, founding member Vittorio De Scalzi (a longtime friend of De Andr√©'s, who frequently includes songs by his fellow Genoan musician into his own stage act), tentatively remembered the line-up for \\"Una storia sbagliata\\" as being made up of himself on piano and keyboards, with PFM's Franz Di Cioccio on drums, Patrick Djivas on bass, and Franco Mussida on guitar. Belloni and Bubola also played guitars and the latter sang a higher-third harmony to De Andr√©. De Scalzi also stated that the backing track for the song was indeed cut live.

The Fort de la Redoute Ruin√©e (Ruined Redoubt) was an old Piedmontese fort on the Col de la Traversette that had been re-built in the 19th century by France as a part of the Ligne Alpine. It defended the Little Saint Bernard Pass. During the Italian invasion of France in June 1940, the fort had been captured by Italy. In April 1945, it was held by the forces of the Italian Social Republic and came under attack by the French. Background In early April 1945 the 4th Alpini Regiment of the 2nd Division Littorio held a long front running from Rifugio Benevolo near Rh√™mes to La Forclaz, passing through several peaks including the Roc de Belleface and Traversette. On 10 April, the French captured the Roc de Belleface, but it was reoccupied by the Alpini and some German troops of the 100th Gebirgsj√§ger RegimentRoberto Nicco, La Resistenza in Valle d'Aosta (Musumeci, 1995), p. 309. the following day. On April 25, the French 27th Alpine Infantry Division under General Eug√®ne Molle was preparing to enter Italian territory (Val d'Aosta) across the Little Saint Bernard. Between 23 and 25 April, the Germans abandoned their positions on the Aosta front, including the Redoute Ruin√©e. They were ordered to concentrate south of Ivrea. During their retreat, they were harassed by Italian partisans. Although they intended to blow up bridges and tunnels and render the highway (Statale 26) and railway unusable,Anna Lisa Carlotti (ed.), Italia 1939‚Äì1945: storia e memoria (Vita e Pensiero, 1996), pp. 425‚Äì28. the commander of the 4th Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Armando De Felice, threatened the German troops with retaliation to prevent demolitions. On 27 April, De Felice contacted Augusto Adam, the local leader of the partisans affiliated with the National Liberation Committee to secure his cooperation against any French invasion of Italian territory, which was given. French attacks The French first attacked the Redoute Ruin√©e on 21 December 1944.Romain Rainero and Antonello Biagini (eds.), L'Italia in guerra: il 5o anno, 1944 (Commissione italiana di storia militare, 1995), p. . On 23 March a second attack towards the Little Saint Bernard began. On 27 March, French artillery began pounding the Redoute Ruin√©e while the 13th Battalion of chasseurs alpins advanced on the fort. A heavy fog prevented accurate artillery spotting and the attack was called off. A second assault on 31 March resulted in the capture of Le Roc Noir, but the Redoute Ruin√©e held out.Jean- Louis Riccioli, \\"La deuxi√®me bataille des Alpes : printemps 1945\\", Cahiers de la M√©diterran√©e 52 (1996), pp. 98 and 107.

By late April the Redoute Ruin√©e was garrisoned by a platoon of forty-six esploratori-arditi of the 4th Regiment under Antonio Rossitto. The chasseurs alpins attacked the fort on the nights of 27/8 and 28/9 April and there was serious fighting. On the morning of the 29 April, De Felice ordered all his positions on French soil, include the Redoute Ruin√©e, be abandoned. That day the French occupied the fort. It was, along with the Roc de Belleface, also occupied that day, the last pieces of French soil under Italian occupation. The retreat of the Italians to their own territory was deliberately slow, at the suggestion of Adam, so as to deter the French. It was complete by the time the Surrender of Caserta took effect on 2 May. The 4th Alpini Regiment surrendered to American forces in Aosta on 4 May.

The assassination, later tied to members within the Conservative Party, occurred outside Hani's home in Dawn Park during a peak period of progressive anti- apartheid momentum in South Africa. After the assassination, racially fuelled riots drew international attention to the instability of the political division within South Africa, leading to an inclusive national democratic election in April 1994, won by the African National Congress (ANC). Assassin Janusz Walu≈õ and accomplice Clive Derby-Lewis were sentenced to death after their arrest in 1993, however this sentencing was later commuted to life imprisonment.  Political Background  Chris Hani joined the ANC (African National Congress) Youth League aged fifteen as a means of following his father‚Äôs political career, who was part of the ANC himself. While at the University of Fort Hare between 1959‚Äì1961 Hani was heavily exposed and influenced by Marxist ideology, claiming this to be due to the liberal nature of the campus. After completing his Bachelor of Latin and English at the Rhodes University in 1962 Hani joined the Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the military wing of the ANC. Due to his commitment to the MK, Hani was arrested under the ‚ÄòSuppression of Communism Act‚Äô and exiled to Lesotho in 1963, where he changed his name to Chris (previously Thembisile) to assist in his hiding. While part of the MK Hani received military training through the Soviet Union and gained a reputation as a soldier of the black army through serving in the Zimbabwean War of Liberation (aka. Rhodesian Bush War) in 1967, acting as the Political Commissioner in the Zimbabwe People‚Äôs Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). In 1974 Hani travelled to the German Democratic Republic (GDR) where he engaged in guerrilla command training for a period of three months before marrying Limpho Sekamane (now Limpho Hani) in Lusaka. Due to his integral role in MK organised guerrilla operations, Hani became the target of assassination attempts from 1981, including a failed car bomb assassination attempt by Ernest Ramatolo on 2 August. Chris Hani returned permanently to South Africa after the unbanning of the ANC in 1990 and quickly became a figurehead of the South African extreme left. Despite the collapse of Communist momentum in Europe, Hani campaigned heavily for the SACP (South African Communist Party) as General- Secretary from 1991. Notably, on September 7, 1992 Hani played an integral role leading a procession of 80,000 people at Victoria Stadium before the mass came under machine gun fire, leading to the death of 28 in an event coined the Bisho Massacre. Hani held his General-Secretary position within SACP until his assassination on 10 April 1993.  Context  After the election of the white- dominant National Party in 1948, South Africa was characterised by ‚Äòapartheid‚Äô, an engrained and dominating system of institutionalised segregation which encouraged the discrimination of coloured demographics. The strength of apartheid at this time was founded upon a political culture of white supremacy, in particular by those of the Conservative Party and National Party, and was adopted by the South African government as formal policy in 1948. In 1950 the Population Registration Act provided a framework of segregation by formally categorising South African citizens by various racial classes. During this time anti-apartheid political groups such as the Afrapix and ANC became heavily organised and employed both passive and aggressive methods to challenge the longevity of apartheid. From 1963 until 1990 Nelson Mandela, founder of the Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) was imprisoned resulting in international support of anti-apartheid progress. From 1985 the United Kingdom and United States imposed an economic sanction upon South Africa, especially upon the importation of coal and uranium, in attempt to strong-arm a democratic election. These sanctions alongside pressure from the United Nations were largely ineffective due to various loop-holes and the independent strength of the South African economy. In 1994 South Africa held its first full democratic election inclusive of all racial votes, resulting in the election of the African National Congress who secured 63.1% of the popular vote and 252 seats in the National Assembly. The ANC has been the governing party of South Africa until present.  Assassination  On 10 April 1993 Chris Hani was assassinated while stepping out of his car at his home in Dawn Park, Boksburg by radical right-wing Polish immigrant Janusz Walu≈õ. Hani was shot at approximately 10:20am and died at the scene. During the attack Hani received two bullets to the chest and an addition two sub-sonic bullets to the head. With him at the time was his daughter Nomakhwezi, then fifteen years old. Margareta Harmse, an Afrikaans housewife, recognised Walu≈õ and his vehicle and immediately called the police, leading to his arrest and interrogation by Sergeant Holmes of the Boksburg Murder and Robbery Squad by 7pm the same day. Soon after Clive Derby-Lewis, the Shadow Minister for Economic Affairs for the Conservative Party of South Africa at the time, was also arrested for complicity in Hani‚Äôs assassination as he had lent Walu≈õ the modified Z88 9 mm pistol used in the attack. The pistol used was unlicensed and stolen from the military by accomplice Jean Taylor through Edwin Clarke and had been in the possession of Derby-Lewis since his preparation for the crime in February. While in trial, Derby-Lewis expressed intentions to engage the country into a ‚Äòrace war‚Äô to deconstruct the reconciliation progress gained ahead of the proposed 1994 democratic elections, a time at which negotiations regarding the ending of apartheid were at a climax. During investigations, police uncovered a ‚Äòhit-list‚Äô compiled by Walu≈õ and Derby- Lewis that featured the residential addresses and names of figurehead left- wing political leaders including Joe Slovo and Nelson Mandela.  Aftermath  Following the assassination riots broke out in Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth due to the climax of tension between the extreme left and far right. Starting as a racial and political movement, youth activist groups escalated the demonstration leading to seven casualties, including three casualties as a result of police fire. Additionally, it is estimated that over 6 million black workers engaged in a one-day strike to commemorate Chris Hani on April 15, 1993. This mass disruption persuaded a decision for a democratic election to take place on the 27th April 1994. According to Jeremy Cronin, then Deputy Secretary of the SACP (South African Communist Party), the actions of Walu≈õ and Derby-Lewis came close to ‚Äúplunging South Africa into civil war‚Äù. In response to the assassination, Mr. Mandela, though yet not President, addressed the nation on 14 April 1993 in attempt to rationalise the conflict between right and left winged politics during this peak of tension, calling for a national day of mourning.  Conspiracy  Several conspiracy theories have emerged suggesting the involvement of alternate political agendas in the Hani assassination, including suggestions by arms-dealer Terry Crawford-Browne regarding the involvement of Joe Modise, the longstanding leader of MK, due to engrained corruption within the ANC. Additionally theories suggest collusion between Clive Derby-Lewis and Thabo Mbeki, second President of South Africa, due to the large political gain he received as a result of the Hani assassination. These claims, however, have not been investigated due to the testimonies of both Walu≈õ and Derby-Lewis. Media claims and National Intelligence Agency reports since the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing have suggested involved conspiracy from the Vlakplaas C-10 counterinsurgency police force within the initial stages of the murder. It is believed that intelligence operatives within the Boksburg general police are linked to the plot. These claims have not been publicly pursued.  Assassins   Janusz Walu≈õ  Janusz Walu≈õ was born in communist Poland on 14 January 1953 and gained residence in South Africa in 1981 to work as a glass maker and truck driver with his father and brother. Later, Walu≈õ joined the National Party and Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, committing his support of far-right politics and their goals to suppress the spread of communism and racial equality through South Africa. Prior to 1993 Walu≈õ became strongly involved with Clive Derby-Lewis and planned a string of political assassinations. Although not testifying at trial, during his 1997 amnesty hearing Walu≈õ openly emphasised the political intent of the assassination ‚Äúto plunge the country into a state of chaos which would allow the right to take over‚Äù, and recalled his experiences in Communist Poland as personal motivation for the crimes. Further, Walu≈õ expressed the influence of the Conservative Party in his crimes, ‚Äú\\"I did it for the CP and to stop communists and radicals from gaining power in this country\\".  Clive Derby-Lewis  Clive Derby- Lewis was a founding member of the Conservative Party and served as the Shadow Minister for Economic Affairs at the time of Chris Hani‚Äôs assassination. Due to his strong public support of apartheid and extreme right-wing policies, Derby-Lewis has been described by Harry Schwartz, his opposing minister, as the ‚Äúbiggest racist in Parliament‚Äù. Derby-Lewis was tied to the murder of Chris Hani due to his conspiracy with Janusz Walu≈õ for the murder of key anti- apartheid members, and the supply of the handgun used in the assassination of Chris Hani. His motivations for his involvement are believed to be due to a political race between the ANC and the Conservative Party who were expected to be dominant parties during the reformation of the South African democracy during the proposed upcoming elections in 1994.  Hearing/Conviction  After their arrest both Walu≈õ and Derby-Lewis were convicted by his Lordship Mr Justice Eloff in the Supreme Court of Johannesburg and were sentenced to death. However, due to a renewed Constitutional ruling in 1995, their sentences were commuted to a life sentence that, until 1997, did not permit the application for future parole or amnesty. At his trial Janusz Walu≈õ never testified. Wife Gaye Derby-Lewis was also tried by the Supreme Court in Johannesburg however was acquitted despite her involvement within the Conservative Party until 1989. Nelson Mandela established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in December 1995 to enable the exposure of all political crimes during the apartheid in attempt to assist South Africa‚Äôs transition to democracy. In 1997 Walu≈õ and Derby-Lewis applied for amnesty to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on the grounds that their actions were political in nature, and that the assassination was as result of orders from the Conservative Party. Hani‚Äôs family was represented by George Bizos in a trial that lasted from the 24‚Äì27 November 1997. Throughout their individual hearings multiple discrepancies came to light regarding the methods and motivations as told by Derby-Lewis and Walu≈õ. The claims by both convicted were denied by the Commission. Throughout his sentence Derby-Lewis continued to apply for parole which was accepted after several failed attempts due to the terminal condition of his lung cancer in June 2015. Derby-Lewis died of his cancer on 3 November 2016. Janusz Walu≈õ continued to apply for parole through the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria which was accepted, however was later rejected in the Supreme Court of Appeal in April 2015 by Michael Masutha, Minister for Justice and Correctional Services. In all cases Walu≈õ has been denied parole due to his lacking remorse and retained political ideology. Walu≈õ is currently 65 years old serving his sentence at Pretoria Central Prison South Africa.

In other words, members of an ethnographic group will also consider themselves to be members of a larger ethnic group, both sharing a collective consciousness with it, and possessing their own distinct one.Wojciech Janicki, The distribution and significance of Tatar ethnic group in Poland Ethnographic groups are presumed to be significantly assimilated with the larger ethnic group they are part of, though they retain distinctive, differentiating characteristics related to cultural values such as speech, religion, costume, or other cultural aspects. The concept of an ethnographic group is rarely found in Western works, and has been attributed to late 20th-century ethnographic studies in the countries of the former Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc. This term has been used for example in works of Bulgarian, Georgian, Hungarian and Polish ethnographers. Paul R. Magocsi, an American historian specializing in Ukrainian studies, described the concept of an ethnographic group as closely related to that of the ethnic group. Some scholars use the term ethnographic group as a synonym to ethnic group. The concept of the ethnographic group as distinct from ethnic group has been rejected by some scholars; and it has been argued that most recent studies do not distinguish between the concepts of ethnographic and ethnic groups. An example of an ethnographic group division would be dividing the Subcarpathian Rus Rusyns ethnic group into Lemkos, Boikian and Hutsul ethnographic groups.

It won the 2018 Man Booker Prize for Fiction, the first time a Northern Irish writer has been awarded the prize. It also won the 2018 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. Set during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, the story follows an 18-year-old girl who is harassed by an older married man known as the \\"milkman\\". The novel received positive reviews from The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph and The Irish Times.  Themes   Politics  In Milkman, everyday behaviours, even non- political ones, are politicised. The protagonist's maybe-boyfriend shows off a new car engine he has bought to his neighbours, only to be marginalised when a few marks on the engine reveal that it was made in Great Britain. The protagonist's desire to avoid political matters is shown by both her refusal to use character names and her reading-while-walking (quite literally burying her head in a book to emancipate from the reality of The Troubles). Her reading-while-walking tragically manifests itself as a rumour that she is having an affair with the milkman, as whenever other characters fail to understand a behaviour (such as the protagonist's preference for literature over politics) it still becomes politicised through their own interpretations of otherwise mundane facts of life.

At the time, Ajman was a dependency of Sharjah. Five years after his establishment at Ajman, the fort was taken by the Darawisha Bedouin who were removed by the action of the Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi. Relatively little is known about the reign of Rashid bin Humaid. He was signatory to the 1820 General Maritime Treaty with the British, becoming one of the first Rulers of the Trucial States, later to become the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Nuaimi name derives from the Na'im tribal confederation which dominated the area around Buraimi and the Northern movement of the tribe, the Al Bu Kharabain appears to have settled in Ajman, as well as the area of Al Heera, Hamriyah and even Sharjah. He acceded to the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 following the British punitive expedition from Bombay against the Al Qasimi at Ras Al Khaimah. In 1819, that force bombarded the coastal settlements of the Gulf Peninsula, including Ajman, leading to the capitulation of the coastal Sheikhs and the signing of the treaty in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah. Rashid bin Humaid signed the treaty on 15 March 1820, together with Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid Al Mualla, Ruler of Umm Al Quwain. Both Rulers signed the treaty at Falayah, an inland dependency of Ras Al Khaimah.

In 2018 she was named one of Porter magazine's Incredible Women of 2018. In January 2019 she delivered the Anne McLaren Memorial Lecture at the Joint Fertility Societies Meeting in Birmingham: Fertility 2019. The Society of Reproduction and Fertility (SRF) presented her with their Distinguished Scientist award.  Education  Telfer obtained her PhD from the University of Edinburgh in 1987. Her thesis investigated factors influencing the development of ovarian follicles in mammals.  Career  Telfer is currently a reproductive biologist and Professor of Reproductive Biology at the University of Edinburgh. She is a former Associate Editor of Molecular Human Reproduction journal. From 1987-1989, Telfer worked in the Department of Physiology at the University of Edinburgh. Here, she worked with the physiologist Roger Gosden to develop a culture systems to support murine follicle development, one of the first of its kind. From 1989-1992 Telfer was a postdoctoral fellow in John Eppig's Laboratory at the Jackson Labs in Bar Harbor Maine. She was the recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation award. She returned to the University of Edinburgh in 1992 as a lecturer and established a research group working on ovarian development. She led research which, in 2016, found evidence that the human ovary may have the capability to grow new eggs in adulthood. However, Telfer warned against premature clinical applications in fertility treatments before the findings have been fully understood. In 2018 she was named as one of Porter magazine's Incredible Women of 2018, recognised for her research growing oocyte cells to maturity in the lab, to the point at which they can be fertilised. The research was the first successful attempt to grow fully mature human eggs, where previously it had only been achieved for mouse eggs. The technique has implications for fertility treatment, in particular in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation and women who had their ovaries removed before cancer treatment.

To create her work, Lomasko travels throughout the former Soviet Union and spends time with those who are rarely represented in the media. She currently resides and works in Moscow, Russia. Victoria Lomasko in 2017  Early life  Lomasko was born in Serpukhov, Russia in 1978. Her father worked as an agitprop artist at a secretive metal-worker factory. At 19 years old she moved to Moscow and attended Moscow State University of Printing Arts, where she graduated in 2003 and received her bachelor's degree in book design and graphic art. She also took classes at the Moscow Institute of Contemporary Art.  Volunteer work  Lomasko visited Mozhaysk Juvenile Prison for the first time in August 2010 as a volunteer for the Center for Prison Reform. During her visits there, she taught the inmates to draw. She continued to teach drawing classes at girl's penitentiaries in Novy Oskol and Ryazan, and the boy's penitentiary in Aleskin until 2014. All the work that was created during the lessons was collected and is currently housed at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a in Madrid.  Career 2010-present   2010  In 2010 Lomasko co-curated the art exhibition called Drawing the Court with Zlata Ponirovska at Gelabert Studios Gallery in New York. That same year she co-authored the book titled The Provinces in collaboration with former political journalist Anton Nikolayev. The book was inspired by a trip to the provinces on which they went. She went on to co-author a second book with Nikolayev titled Forbidden Art. The book is a 158-page documentary graphic novel that documents the legal trial of the organizers of the Forbidden Art 2006 exhibition that was held at Andrei Sakharov Museum in Moscow in 2007. Forbidden Art was published by Boomkniga Publishers in St. Petersburg and was nominated for the 2010 Kadnisky Prize.  2012  In 2012, Lomasko's drawings began to be exhibited in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and all over Europe. She participated in shows like \\"Occupy Abay\\". Around the same time, she collaborated with Nadia Plungian to curate The Feminist Pencil, an exhibit that showcased mostly Russian women's graphic art. The first Feminist Pencil took place at a hostel in Moscow called Fabrika and featured only 6 artists.The pair continued working together and in 2013 produced The Feminist Pencil 2, which was shown in St. Petersburg, Oslo, and Berlin. At the time of Putin's reelection, it had become incredibly difficult for Lomasko to publish and show her work in Russia. At this time, a feminist group in Kyrgyzstan invited her to Bishkek to teach a workshop. In the following years, she traveled to places such as Dagestan, Georgia, and Armenia, producing a series of work that explored these places.  2016  In 2016 Lomasko produced a solo exhibition, Feminist Travels which was exhibited at the Goethe Institute in Tbilisi, Georgia.  2017  In 2017 Lomasko created two solo exhibitions that were shown in The United States. The first, Other Russias: Angry, was displayed at the Ellis Gallery, in Carnegie Mellon University in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh while Unwanted Women was displayed at the Ortega Y Gasset Art Projects in Brooklyn, New York. Lomasko also created an exhibition titled The Daughter of an Artist Decorator which was displayed at The Arts Centre HOME in Manchester, UK. A collection of Lomasko's work was published in March 2017 by the Brooklyn publishing house n+1 as Other Russias. It is her first English book (translated by Thomas Campbell) and the first time her work has been collected. In June 2017, it was republished by Penguin UK and has been translated into multiple languages, including German and French. The 320-page book consists of two sections: the first section, Invisible, focuses on the experiences of marginalized groups prior to the 2012 protests. In Lomasko's own words \\"Invisible contains stories about juvenile prison wards, teachers and pupils at rural schools, migrant workers, old people seeking refuge in Russian Orthodoxy, sex workers, and single women in the Russian hinterlands.\\" The second section, Angry focuses on the Russian political opposition parties from 2012-16. In Lomasko's own words \\"Angry chronicles people's attempts to come together and take back their voice and rights from the state. It includes reports of the large opposition rallies that took place in Moscow in 2012 and the subsequent trials of protesters; the LGBT community's efforts to stay visible despite the government's adoption of homophobic laws; and protests by national and local grassroots \\"pressure groups\\" in 2015 and 2016.\\" Later in 2017, Lomasko embarked on a U.S book tour to support the release of her book. The English version of Other Russias won the 2018 Pushkin House Prize for Best Book in Translation.  2018  In 2018 Lomasko produced two solo exhibitions that were displayed in the United Kingdom. The first titled Apparition of the Last Soviet Artist was shown at GRAD, Somerset House in London, and the second titled On the Eve was shown at the Pushkin House also located in London. Lomasko also created an exhibition titled Our Post-Soviet Land which was displayed at Edith-Russ-Haus for Media Art, in Oldenburg, Germany.  2019  In 2019 Lomasko created a collection of murals titled Atlases which was done at The Havighurst Center for Russian and Post-Soviet Studies, at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, USA. She went on to create another collection of murals titled Separated World which was done at Edel Assanti in London, UK.

History  Jacaranda Books was founded in December 2011 in London by Valerie Brandes after she left Profile Books. with the purpose of promoting inclusivity and diversity in publishingJacaranda Books Art Music Ltd United Kingdom issuu.com, \\"...it is our mission to create a space for lesser known, diverse voices to be seen and heard by new readers.\\", accessed 24 January 2019 and continuing the legacy of pioneers of diverse publishing such as Margaret Busby, Verna Wilkins, Eric Huntley and Jessica Huntley. At the time of foundation, according to professor Claire Squires (Professor of Publishing Studies, and Director of the Stirling Centre for International Publishing and Communication at the University of Stirling), the publishing industry in United Kingdom had a homogenised white, middle- class and Oxbridge-dominated workforce. This was reflected in the content published in the industry as a whole which mirrored the situation. Jacaranda Books' strategy was to address the lack of diversity and the culture of risk aversion in the industry by publishing worldwide renowned titles (such as Rest in power) and award-winning authors (including Bernice McFadden, Fiston Mwanza Mujila, Anietie Isong and Irenosen Okojie) some of whom were previously unpublished in the UK. Six years later, across 90% of the book publishing industry in the UK the situation remained the same. In 2018 Jacaranda partnered with the creative communications agency Words Of Colour to call for submissions for TwentyIn2020 and publish 20 black British writers in the year 2020, which would be a first in publishing history. Later in 2018 11.6% of the workforce in publishing was identified as BAME, reaching 13.0% by 2019.  #TwentyIn2020  In February 2018 Jacaranda Books released a call for submissions for Twenty In 2020, which started a chain reaction on the industry: Hachette launched Dialogue BooksIn 2018, the imprint officially launched with four exciting debuts Sparking the Conversation littlebrown.co.uk, accessed 28 July 2020 headed by Sharmaine Lovegrove in May 2018 (publicly inspired by Jacaranda Books, and signing Irenosen Okojie), Penguin Random House launched #Merky Books headed by Stormzy in October 2018,Cornerstone- #Merky Books The imprint launched with Stormzy‚Äôs first book, Rise Up, in autumn 2018 penguin.co.uk, accessed 28 July 2020 and HarperCollins appointed Nancy Adimora to a new diversity area in February 2020. A year after the call for submissions the national press made echo of the campaign, and historical partnerships were begun with the London Library and other partners like Foyles. By 2020 Jacaranda's TwentyIn2020 remains the biggest collection of black authors published in the same year, an effort that was recognised in July 2020 when Jacaranda was awarded the title of 'Small Press of the Year' at the Bookseller's British Books Awards.  #AQuickTingOn  On September 2019 Jacaranda announced another campaign A Quick Ting On, a groundbreaking new non-fiction series focused on the black British community, all written by young black British writers. A similar series was later announced by #Merky Books, including Anthony Anaxagorou, an author previously published by Jacaranda Books.  #InclusiveIndies and the #BlackLivesMatter movement  In July 2013, Black Lives Matter began on social media after the Trayvon Martin case. The book Rest in Power: The Enduring Life of Trayvon Martin narrates the facts that began the movement, it was published in United States by Penguin, but not in United Kingdom, where it is published by Jacaranda as part of their stand for diversity. In June 2020, Jacaranda in partnership with Knights Of collected ¬£160k in the crowdfunding campaign #InclusiveIndies. This was an appeal to try to assure their survival in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The appeal won extra traction through the BlackLivesMatter movement of 2020. After the campaign, the founder of Jacaranda was interviewed in 5 News by Claudia-Liza Armah Valerie Brandes: Why diverse literature is important for society to tackle racism Youtube/5 News, accessed 28 July 2020 on \\"Why diverse literature is important for society to tackle racism\\".

It is also known as Peter O'Hara's General Store and Simmons Store. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  226 George Street was built in the mid-nineteenth century. It housed a general store run by Peter O'Hara, a prominent local businessman. It weathered the great fire that ravaged Windsor in December 1874. The fire engulfed the building where the packing straw for O'Hara's goods of tin, earthenware and china was quickly fanned into flames and is believed to have destroyed all but the brick walls. A new store, or rebuilding of the earlier store, was completed shortly after.

The observatory was built in 1845 by John Tebbutt. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Indigenous history The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups.Proudfoot, 1987 The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport.Nichols, 2010 Colonial history Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. The area on which the Peninsula House complex now stands is located on land first alienated for European purposes in a grant made by Francis Grose of thirty acres to Samuel Wilcox, who named it Wilcox Farm. It is likely that land clearance and agricultural activities as well as some building works took place during this period and during the subsequent of occupation. The former Wilcox farm was incorporated into a larger holding of known as Peninsula Farm in the early nineteenth century. Governor Lachlan Macquarie replaced Governor Bligh, assuming the office on 1 January 1810. Under his influence the colony prospered. His vision was for a free community, working in conjunction with the penal colony. He implemented an unrivalled public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. Under his leadership Hawkesbury district thrived. He visited the district on his first tour and recorded in his journal on 6 December 1810: \\"After dinner I chrestened the new townships...I gave the name of Windsor to the town intended to be erected in the district of the Green Hills...the township in the Richmond district I have named Richmond...\\" The district reminded Macquarie of those towns in England, whilst Castlereagh, Pitt Town and Wilberforce were named after English statesmen. These are often referred to as Macquarie's Five Towns. Their localities, chiefly Windsor and Richmond, became more permanent with streets, town square and public buildings.  Peninsular House and Tebbutt's Observatory  In 1842 John Tebbutt's father who had migrated as a free settler in 1801 to the Hawkesbury as a successful farmer, acquired land on this \\"peninsula\\" and built the Peninsula House (also known as Peninsular House) in 1845. A two-storey wing was later added at the rear.(Le Sueur, 2017, 7) John Tebbutt (1824-1916) was born at Windsor, educated locally and developed an interest in astronomy.ASHET, 2008, 3 He was inspired by his school teacher, Edward Quaife, who encouraged him. He became passionately interested in mechanical objects and \\"celestial mechanisms\\", gradually accumulating instruments and experience.Le Sueur, 2017, 7 Tebbutt bought his first instrument, a marine sextant, in 1853. He achieved international fame when he was the first to discover the \\"Great Comet of 1861\\", announcing his discovery of one of the finest comets on record. In 1862 he refused the position of Government Astronomer for New South Wales because it meant leaving Windsor. In either 1863 or 1864, John Tebbutt erected a small round wooden observatory in the garden (since demolished). A second circular structure was built in 1874 and in 1879 he built a second, larger circular observatory close to the old one. Tebbutt was a private astronomer and a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society who continued to make patient, reliable astronomical observations and published regularly, building an international reputation. From the observatories he watched various astronomical phenomena - lunar occultations of stars, Jupiter's satellites, comets, minor planets, double stars, transits of Mercury and Venus - and his work won international acknowledgement. In 1872 he bought an refracting telescope with which he observed the transit of Venus in 1874 and in 1886 imported a Grubb refracting telescope and housed it in a substantial brick observatory building on his property at Windsor. The telescope later went to New Zealand but was returned to Australia at the time of the Australian Bicentenary and rehoused in its original location. Hawkesbury City Council now owns the telescope. Tebbutt spent his whole life at Windsor, devoting most of his time to astronomy. He never left Australia, but corresponded with colleagues around the world and published widely. Tebbutt's \\"Astronomical Memoirs\\" of 1908 listed his 371 publications in various learned journals. His image and the observatory was on the $100 note from 1984 to 1996. He had six daughters and one son. He died in 1916 and was buried in the Anglican cemetery in a vault that he designed himself. The funeral was one of the largest ever held at Windsor. His direct descendants owned and occupied the house until 2017.  Description  Peninsula House and the former observatory sit on a site located close to Windsor on high ground, which, when the river (Hawkesbury) floods, becomes a secluded, unspoilt island, filled with native plants and fauna and protected from development. Peninsula House Peninsula House is a two-storey Georgian style house of sandstock brick. The main roof and verandah are slate, the latter supported on delicate cast iron columns, the centre bay marked with a simple pediment. There are six-panel doors and windows are six pane double hung sashes with stone sills and were originally shuttered, whilst sandstone is used for the foundations, a string course and flagging to the verandah. A two-storey late Victorian brick wing was built at the rear. The original house contains some fine Georgian marble chimney pieces and cedar joinery.Sheedy 1975 Tebbutt's Observatory There are two brick observatories in the old garden. The smaller one is circular with a segmental flat iron pitched roof. The larger one is also face brick with sandstone quoins, classical pediment over a porch and dentilled cornice to the roof parapet. Windows are of unusual proportions with stuccoed decorations and timber shutters, while the iron segmental roof is double pitched octagonal in form.

They are often used in dog fighting, hunting, and guarding. The Gull Terrier is related to the Bull Terrier breeds that come from Great Britain. These English dog breeds, along with those indigenous to the Indian subcontinent such as the Bully Kutta, played a major role in the Gull Terrier's breeding development and are considered to be a direct ancestor of the modern Gull Terrier. Description A Gull Terrier is a tall, broad chested, medium-sized molosser dog that is mostly found in Pakistan and India. Gull Terriers have large erect ears. Their coats are normally white, although sometimes they have dark colored markings on their faces and bodies. Gull Terriers are wary of strangers. They are protective of their owners and territory. They are highly trainable. Origin During the era of the British Raj in India, Bull Terriers were introduced to the northwest Indian subcontinent, which now includes the modern republics of India and Pakistan. In colonial India, the Bull Terrier breed soared in popularity, with the Bull Terrier Club of India being established in Calcutta. Bull Terriers were crossed with local breeds to develop the Gull Terrier, often called the Indian Bull Terrier and also now the Indo-Pakistani Bull Terrier. The Gull Terrier is a medium-sized dog with short, smooth fur which resembles that of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. These dogs were originally used in blood sports such as bull baiting, and dog fighting - a bloody entertainment introduced by the British to the Indian subcontinent. When the blood sport was made illegal across the Empire, the Gull Terriers were used as guard dogs. In colonial India, some breeders crossed the Gull Terrier with the Bully Kutta, naming the progeny the \\"Gull Dong\\", which \\"is celebrated in India and Pakistan for its speed and tenacity\\". Indian Gull Terr Health The Gull Terrier is prone to deafness and blindness, but aside from that, there are no common medical problems affecting these dogs. Many foreign Gull Terrier owners choose to fly to India for affordable treatment of medical conditions affecting their pets. Ban Under the New York City Housing Authority, Gull Terriers, alongside Gull Dongs, are banned in homes. The dog is also banned in the Cayman Islands.

The attack was the greatest loss of life in school violence in the former Soviet Union since the 2004 Beslan school siege. Attack Vladislav Roslyakov purchased a shotgun on 8 September and bought 150 rounds legally at a gun shop on 13 October. He entered the grounds of Kerch Polytechnic College on 17 October at about 11:45 a.m. and shortly after began shooting. A survivor of the incident said that the shooting lasted for more than 15 minutes. Several witnesses described a gunman walking up and down the halls at Kerch Polytechnic College and firing randomly at classmates and teachers. He also fired at computer monitors, locked doors and fire extinguishers. A large nail-bomb was detonated during the attack, and local police said that they deactivated more explosives on the campus. Student witnesses described the explosion as blasting out the windows, and that people running to escape were shot at point blank range. However, there was initially variation in survivors' accounts of the incident, with some claiming that a large bomb exploded and others describing only gunfire and the use of grenades. The town website claimed that the explosion occurred on the first floor although the shooting occurred on the second. CNN reported that state television channel Russia-24 said that 200 military personnel had been sent to the location. Eyewitness accounts differ about the time it took for law enforcement to respond, as times differ between 10 and 15 minutes, even though a police station is across the street, within 300 meters (approx. 990 feet) of the college. The massacre ended when the gunman committed suicide in the college's library. A graphic video of the attack was captured by school surveillance cameras and posted on the news programme Vesti.Krym's YouTube channel and on its website, but was removed from both shortly afterwards. Victims Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee said that most of the victims were teenagers. Fifteen students and five teachers died and according to the Investigative Committee, all died of gunshot wounds. The Kerch Deputy Mayor Dilyaver Melgaziyev clarified on 18 October that six of the deceased were under the age of 18. Crimean authorities have published a list of the initial 20 victims who were killed. * Ksenia Boldina (17) * Vladislav Verdibozhenko (15) * Victoria Demchuk (16) * Ruden Juraev (16) * Anna Zhuravleva (19) * Alina Kerova (16) * Alexey Lavrinovich (19) * Egor Perepelkin (17) * Vladislav Lazarev (19) * Ruslan Lysenko (17) * Roman Karymov (21) * Danil Pipenko (16) * Sergey Stepanenko (15) * Nikita Florensky (16) * Daria Chegerest (16) * Anastasia Baklanova (26) * Svetlana Baklanova (57) * Larisa Kudryavtseva (62) * Alexander Moiseenko (46) * Lyudmila Ustenko (65) * Vladislav Roslyakov (18) (perpetrator) The Russian Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova told reporters that a total of 70 people were wounded, 10 were in critical condition, including five in comas.  Perpetrator  The attack was perpetrated by a fourth-year student of the college, 18-year-old Vladislav Igorevich Roslyakov (). When Roslyakov was around ten years old, his parents broke up when his father sustained a severe head injury, after which he became disabled and aggressive towards Roslyakov, his mother and other relatives. Roslyakov studied at a local school with no interest and poor grades. He had few friends and his hobbies included weapons and video games. In 2015 he joined the college to study to become an electrician. In college he developed an interest in explosives and weapons and started to take a knife bayonet to class. One day he discharged pepper spray in a class and failed to explain his actions. His mother belonged to the local Jehovah's Witnesses, who limited his social activity, searched his pockets and refused to allow him to go to the cinema or use a computer, only allowing the latter when he turned 16. In the days before the attack he stated that he did not believe in the afterlife. On the eve of the attack, according to neighbors, Roslyakov burned a Bible in which he had highlighted verses. Employees of emergency services A friend has claimed that Roslyakov \\"hated the polytechnic very much\\" and had vowed revenge on his teachers. There were also reports that he may have been bullied. According to an ex-girlfriend, he said he had lost faith in people when his classmates started to ridicule him for being different. In the days before the attack he discussed ignorance by others, the lack of purpose in his life, mass shootings and suicide on social media. Roslyakov was in a number of online communities dedicated to serial killers. Surveillance footage of the incident shows Roslyakov wearing black trousers and a white T-shirt emblazoned with the Russian word \\"–ù–ï–ù–ê–í–ò–°–¢–¨\\" (hatred) as he carries an eight-shot 12 gauge Hatsan Escort Aimguard pump-action shotgun with a pistol grip. His clothing resembles that of Eric Harris, one of the perpetrators of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, leading to speculation that the massacre was a copycat crime. According to some Russian tabloids, he had been a member of various Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold fanclubs on social networks, and had informed friends of his belief that \\"it would be good to have a massacre\\", specifically referencing Columbine High School massacre as an example. Furthermore, he had mentioned his belief in the two perpetrators being \\"awesome gone\\". Like Eric Harris, Roslyakov committed suicide in the library of the college, by shooting himself with his shotgun.  Investigation  Investigators in the days after the attack attempted to establish Roslyakov's motive and suggested that they were treating it as a school shooting. Officials are investigating concerns in the case, such as where Roslyakov got the 30,000‚Äì40,000 rubles (about $450‚Äì600 USD) for the weapon, and where he learned to use those weapons. It was discovered Roslyakov obtained a weapon permit in 2018 and owned the gun legally, after completing a legally required training on weapon security and presenting all required documents, including medical report. He periodically attended a shooting club. Shortly before the shooting he legally purchased 150 rounds of ammunition. The Investigative Committee ordered a psychiatric evaluation of Roslyakov postmortem. Crimean Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov stated on 18 October that it was possible the perpetrator had an accomplice, and police were searching for the individual \\"who was coaching\\" Roslyakov for the crime. However, on 9 November 2018, the Investigative Committee came to the conclusion that Roslyakov had acted alone.  Reactions Crimean Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov announced that there would be three days of mourning. Crimean State Council speaker Vladimir Konstantinov announced that the victims' families would receive financial compensation, with preliminary discussions suggesting that the payments would be 1 million rubles (USD ) from the Russian federal budget and 1 million rubles from the local budget. He also said that it was impossible to conceive that 18-year-old suspect Vladislav Roslyakov had prepared the attack by himself saying \\"On the ground, he acted alone, that is already known and established, but in my opinion and in the opinion of my colleagues this reprobate could not have carried out the preparations.\\" Russia's Investigative Committee initially classified the attack as terrorism but later changed it to mass murder. After the first reports of an alleged terrorist attack in Kerch, many Russian politicians and mass media suggested that the events were the activities of \\"Ukrainian saboteurs\\" and that the Ukrainian government was responsible, but changed their views after more information emerged, while others questioned whether Roslyakov was sufficiently checked before being allowed to purchase a gun and ammunition, which Roslyakov legally did. Sergei Mikhailovich Smirnov, deputy head of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), said the security services needed to have greater control over the Internet. Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi that the attack appeared to be the result of globalisation, social media and the internet, and that \\"everything started with the tragic events in schools in the US...we're not creating healthy (Internet) content for young people...which leads to tragedies of this kind.\\" Some saw the remarks to be a part of Russians blaming the West for the attack and a linkage with his past as head of the Kremlin and FSB before becoming president which The Irish Times said are \\"suspicious of the internet and social media, seeing them as western-dominated technologies that can be used to stir up dissent and street protests.\\" Russian political analyst Sergey Mikheyev on Russian state TV blamed the attack on \\"Western subculture,\\" claiming that it \\"builds its matrix on the cult of violence...the one who has a weapon in his hands is right. This is a purely American approach to the matter.\\" Some media saw the remarks to be a part of Russians blaming the West for the attack. Leaders of several countries expressed their condolences to the victims of the attack, including Armenia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Thailand, the UK, and Venezuela. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko expressed condolences to the victims, whom he described as Ukrainian citizens, stating that the Prosecutor General's Office of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea had initiated criminal proceedings under the article \\"act of terrorism\\". The Secretary General of the Council of Europe Thorbj√∏rn Jagland and Secretary-General of the United Nations Ant√≥nio Guterres also expressed condolences. Some newspapers described the attack as \\"Russia's Columbine\\", a reference to the 1999 US high school massacre. Steven Rosenberg said the attack should not be surprising as he noted there had already been five attacks in schools in Russia in 2018 where a number of children were injured. A Telegraph article also claimed there had been half a dozen school attacks in Russia in 2018, although claiming the previous incidents involved knives and traumatic pistols rather than high-powered firearms.  Aftermath  Students returned to studies 23 October, with checkpoints at the entrances at which the students‚Äô identities are confirmed. A spokesperson for the Rostov Region Directorate of the Russian Emergency Ministry, told reporters: \\"An examination has been carried out. According to the preliminary information, there is no danger of [the building's] collapse.\\"  Contagion  On 28 May 2019 a student in Volsk, Saratov Region, Russia committed an attack. The attacker, 15-year-old Daniil Pulkin, was obsessed with Roslyakov. According to a 25 February 2020 statement made by FSB, two adolescent fans of Roslyakov wanted to target 2 schools in Kerch.  Memorials  The ceremony in Kerch took place on Lenin Square Throughout Russia and other countries, hundreds of people gathered for memorials for the victims. In Moscow the memorial of Kerch in the Alexander Garden was decorated with flowers. A makeshift memorial was created outside of the school, for residents and survivors to bring flowers and toys. An open memorial and funeral for the victims was held in the central square of Kerch, with a speech by Sergey Aksyonov, who told the crowd; \\"We don't want to talk, we want to weep. The history of Crimea will be divided in two ‚Äî before and after 17 October. We need to be strong we need to be brave.\\" Around 20,000 people were estimated to have attended the public funeral in Kerch.

Born in Moor Row in Cumberland, Burns worked from the age of twelve in an iron ore mine at Yarlside, joining the Cumberland Iron Ore Miners' Association on his first day. He was one of twelve children, but after his father was injured in an accident, he became the main wage earner for his family.Robert G. Neville, \\"Burns, Isaac\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.IV, pp.46‚Äì47 The mines in Yarlside were flooded in 1891, and Burns moved to Hemsworth in Yorkshire to find work at the South Kirkby Colliery. Later in the year, he migrated to the United States, working at copper, silver and gold mines from Montana to Arizona, but he returned to Hemsworth in 1895, and joined the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA). On returning to Yorkshire, Burns joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and during the 1897 Barnsley by-election, his cottage was the campaign headquarters for the party. In 1897, he was elected to Hemsworth Rural District Council, serving continuously until its abolition in 1922; he also served on the Hemsworth Board of Guardians from 1906. He was known for wearing a bright red tie, to symbolise his socialist views. Burns' high political profile led him to prominence in the union; he became auditor of the South Kirkby lodge, then successively secretary, collector, and president, and from 1912 the branch delegate to the YMA Council. In the late 1900s, he was sacked for his trade union activities, but the union stood by him, and after ten months was able to get him a new role as a checkweighman at the colliery. He also served on the Yorkshire County Joint Wages Board for fifteen years. Burns opposed World War I, an unpopular position at the time. He was selected as the Labour Party candidate in Pontefract at the 1918 United Kingdom general election, but was defeated, perhaps due to his pacifist views. He stood again, in the 1919 Pontefract by-election, increasing his vote share to 46.0%, but again failed to win election. In 1922, Hemsworth was given an Urban District Council, and Burns was elected to it, chairing it on two occasions. He remained with the ILP after it split from the Labour Party in 1932, and the party considered standing him in the 1934 Hemsworth by-election, although it did not ultimately do so.

Calkins House, originally built as a single-family home, is located at 127 East 1st Street in Perry, Michigan. It now houses the Calkins- McQueen Museum, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History Charles H. Calkins came to Michigan in 1855 with his father and uncle, and claimed 60 acres of farming land. He cleared the land and resold it, the purchased 160 acres nearer the main state road. The new farm prospered, and in about 1870 Calkins built a large house for his family. In the late 1890s, a rail line was planned through the area, and local residents voted to establish a depot and village at the point where the line crossed the main state road. This turned out to be on Calkins's farmland, and in 1900 Calings opened his lands for purchase, founding the village of Perry. Calkins himself was instrumental in the growth of the village, starting the first general store, serving in various capacities in the village government, helping start a local bank and factory, and helping found three local churches. Calkins lived in his house until his death in 1917. His remaining property, including his house, was inherited by his daughter, Bessie Calkins MacQueen. At her death in 1941, Mrs. MacQueen donated the house to the Village of Perry, under the condition that it be left standing and kept in good condition. The village used it for storage, or rented it out, until the early 1970s. At that time, the village planned to tear it down to construct a new city hall complex. However, it was eventually turned over to the Perry Historical Society, who developed it into the Calkins-McQueen Museum. Description The Calkins House is a square, two-story, clapboarded, Italianate building with a symmetrical arrangement of doors and windows on the front facade. The first floor has a central entrance flaked by tri-sided bay windows. One-over-one sash window units are on the sides of the bays, an ornamental cornice is above and fielded panels are below. The main entrance is within a small porch with an arched molding at the top. A heavy cornice moldings similar to those over the bay windows is above, and two square columns with molded caps support the porch roof. The second story level has a narrow central one-over-one hung sash window flanked by two larger windows, each created by two one-over-one hung sash units. The windows are decorated with carved ornaments. A hipped roof tops the house.

Thereafter, it produced various specialists to work in metallurgical regions of Ukraine and at the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy of the USSR, remaining the sole special secondary educational institution in the city until 1952. The tekhnikum changed its profile and became a polytechnic in 1990. In 2011, it has been reorganized into Kerch Polytechnic College of the National University of Food Technologies (). Shortly after the annexation of Crimea by Russia, the college was nationalized under Order of the State Council of Crimea on 11 April 2014. On 7 April 2015, the Museum of Battle Glory was opened at the college on the initiative of its tutor Vitaly Nekrasov. The Kerch Tekhnikum of Service Industry (found in 1925) was merged with Kerch Polytechnic College in 2016. On 17 October 2018, it was the site of the Kerch Polytechnic College massacre, in which 20 people were killed and 70 injured. The perpetrator committed suicide at the scene.

Ingersoll House is a single-family home located at 570 West Corunna Avenue in Corunna, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History John Ingersoll was born in North Castle, New York in 1817. The family moved to New York City, where in 1828 John's parents died. He was adopted by his uncle, and two years later began an apprenticeship as a printer at a newspaper in New York. In 1837, Henry Barnes, owner of the Detroit Free Press, noticed Ingersoll and invited him to work in Detroit. Ingersoll moved there with his wife Harriett, but the next year he left the Free Press to become foreman on the Detroit Daily Advertiser, and in 1839 he went into the publishing business himself by publishing the Macomb Statesman in Mt. Clemens, Michigan. He moved on the St. Clair, Michigan to publish the Banner in 1842. Ingersoll continued to wander to different papers, publishing the Lake Superior News and Miners Journal from first Copper Harbor, Michigan and then Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. He returned to Detroit, publishing two papers there, moved to Rochester, New York, and in 1858 moved to Owosso, Michigan to publish the American. Harriett Ingersoll died in 1860, and John Ingersoll settled down somewhat, entering local politics, and in 1862 merging the Owosso American with the Corunna Democrat, changing the name of the merged publication to the Shiawassee American. He married Mrs. Julia H. Barnum of Owosso in 1864, and built a new house for the family in Corunna in 1868. He continued in politice, and published papers in Corunna and Owosso until his death in 1881. Description The John N. Ingersoll House is a three-bay, two-story, wood frame Carpenter Gothic residence. The house has board and batten siding and steeply pitched gable roofs, accented with ski- slope eaves and decorative bargeboards. The front facade is symmetrical, with a wide projecting center bay. The front entryway is topped with a small-paned transom and flanked by side lights. Two four-over-four double hung sash windows are located to the right of the door. On the second story are two paired four-over-four double hung sash windows. A gable roof caps the center bay, with a curved diamond window in the gable end. The bay to the right of center contains a tri-sided bay at the first floor level with multi-paned double hung sash windows. Above this is a four-over-four double hung sash window within a small gable, breaking the eavesline of the main roof. A similar window is on the second story level of the bay to the left of center. Below, a twentieth century porch obscures the original first floor level of the front facade on the left and center bay.

It was designed by Francis Greenway and built from 1817 by convict labour. The property is owned by the Anglican Church Property Trust. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Indigenous history The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups.Proudfoot, 1987 The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport.Nichols, 2010 Colonial history Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. In 1794, the land on which the church now stands was first alienated for European purposes in a grant made by Francis Grose of thirty acres to Samuel Wilcox, who named it Wilcox Farm. It is likely that land clearance and agricultural activities as well as some building works took place during this period and subsequently. In the early nineteenth century, the former Wilcox Farm was incorporated into a larger holding of known as Peninsula Farm. Governor Lachlan Macquarie replaced Governor Bligh, taking up duty on 1 January 1810. Under his influence the colony prospered. His vision was for a free community, working in conjunction with the penal colony. He implemented an unrivalled public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. Under his leadership Hawkesbury district thrived. He visited the district on his first tour and recorded in his journal on 6 December 1810: \\"After dinner I christened the new townships...I gave the name of Windsor to the town intended to be erected in the district of the Green Hills...the township in the Richmond district I have named Richmond...\\" the district reminded Macquarie of those towns in England, whilst Castlereagh, Pitt Town and Wilberforce were named after English statesmen. These are often referred to as Macquarie's Five Towns. Their localities, chiefly Windsor and Richmond, became more permanent with streets, town square and public buildings.  St Matthew's Church  Tenders had been called in August 1816, plans had been drawn up, bricks had been made and material supplied. Henry Kitchen, builder, was paid a total of A‚Ç§800 in the next two years for his work. But reports on the building's progress were disturbing, and finally, Macquarie requested Greenway to investigate the situation. To Greenway's mind, his plan was being ruined by poor materials and bad workmanship. He condemned the structure and recommended that it should be removed and the building commenced anew. A specially appointed committee also reached the same conclusion. Greenway had appointed John Jones of Windsor as his building superintendent for St Matthew's. Jones allowed for upward of 200,000 bricks to be made on his land and in return received of land beyond the Blue Mountains, just south of Kelso. Governor Macquarie's prompt action in ordering the church to be pulled down and a fresh start must have spurred Greenway on to produce a new and grander design. Macquarie's leadership was investigated by an enquiry into the colony's affairs and the Bigge Report concluded that a free and penal society could co-exist but with tighter controls on convict management. Governor Macquarie resigned and returned to England in 1822. Prior to departing the colony he visited the Hawkesbury with his successor Sir Thomas Brisbane. They inspected Francis Greenway's new St Matthew's Church as well as other public buildings in Windsor. The Hawkesbury inhabitants presented Macquarie with a public address which commended him on his administration. The residents requested Macquarie sit for a portrait and flattered by the request, he agreed. The painting was completed in England and returned to Windsor and has hung in the Windsor Court House since the 1820s, in the district where he was so highly esteemed. The Rev. Samuel Marsden, principal Chaplain of the Colony, consecrated the Church on 8 December 1822 and the Hawkesbury settlers attended the service in large numbers. The porch was added to the southern side of the Church in 1857, temporarily obscuring Macquarie's large commemorative stone which was later discovered and placed on the outer wall of the porchProudfoot 1987 ;The Stables The tenders for the \\"office-house\\" attached to the Rectory was advertised on 7 and 14 October 1824 respectively. Built by William Cox, local builder and developer, the stables were completed during 1825 from plans prepared by either Francis Greenway or Standish Harris. From church records it is conclusive that by the 1890, the stables were in a dilapidated state as outlined by complaints by the then rector, D'Arcy Irvine. It appears that repairs were undertaken during the 1890s and involved possibly the changing of the roof from shingles to iron. In 1891 an additional expenditure to paint seven doors and windows and coat the building with \\"Lime and Copperas\\" was incurred. By 1936 the stables were again in a state of disrepair and there was a recommendation made to demolish them. The church Synod involved the then Professor of Architecture at the University of Sydney, Prof Leslie Wilkinson. It was decided not to demolish the stables, and the only works undertaken was the removal of a partition wall. Verbal advice has dated as , the removal of an internal brick wall of the coach-house to allow a car to be garaged and confirmed that in the 1970s the timber props were installed in an attempt to prevent further deterioration of the brick wall by Mrs Rawson from a personal legacy. Restoration efforts In 1965, the church was restored by the NSW Government and the National Trust of Australia with money raised by the Trust's women's committee, which had raised a substantial sum of money in a public appeal to assist the conservation of three properties: the church, Experiment Farm Cottage, and Lindesay. In 2002-03, a federal heritage CHPP grant of $99,985 was awarded for Stained Glass Window Restoration.Edds & Co., 1999 In 2016 the Anglican Parish of St Matthews, Windsor has launched a restoration appeal for proposed works which include a new columbarium wall, restoring the Church tower and Rectory windows. The first stage aims to raise $400,000.National Trust of Australia (NSW), National Trust NSW News, Spring edition, August‚ÄìSeptember 2016, 4 Also in 2016 to celebrate 200 years since Governor Macquarie laid its foundation stone, the parish council commissioned a book on the Church, written by Ian Jack and Jan Barkley-Jack. The book was officially launched on 12 November 2016 by Professor The Hon. Dame Marie Bashir AD CVO.  Description  The grave of Henry Kable, located at St Matthew's Anglican Church, pictured in 2013. ;St Matthew's Church A fine Georgian church, constructed entirely by convict labour using sandstock bricks and sandstone. The dominant element is a sculptural square tower with octagonal cupola, axially arranged with a rectangular nave and semi circular apse. The interior contains much fine cedar joinery, including a coffered ceiling and gallery. Its siting is magnificent, on a hill above the town, and this reveals Greenway's sensitive appreciation of a building's relationship to the landscape.Edds & Co. Mrs William McQuade (of Fairfield, Windsor)'s monument is the imposing, and largest at the front entrance of St Matthew's Anglican Church, Windsor.HMAS Kuttabul, 1986 The church was reported to be in excellent physical condition as of May 2000. It retains good archaeological potential and has undergone less alteration than any other Greenway building. ;St Matthew's Rectory An exceptional two storey sandstock brick house of symmetrical design with central front door and elegant fanlight surmounted by a carved timber cornice. An unusual feature for a building of this type in Australia is the central brick pediment breaking the simple line of the hipped roof. Sandstone is used for narrow string courses and flagging at the front porch. The internal joinery pieces are of cedar, as are interior folding window shutters and an elegant semi circular staircase.Sheedy 1974 ;Cemetery The cemetery is older than the Church and contains many tombstones commemorating the early settlers of the Windsor District. The oldest tombstone (1810) was laid in memory of Andrew Thompson. ;The Stables These are a rectangular two storey sand stock brick building with a hipped roof covered with corrugated iron. A loft divided into two rooms is located above the current four room form below. The footings are sandstone, the walls solid brick of Flemish bond externally and English internally. The openings on the Eastern side comprise a mixture of windows, doors and two loft openings. The western side contains an original window including remnant joinery pieces and two doors. There are circular sandstone ventilation opening in these walls. There are no openings in the southern and northern walls. A chimney abuts the south wall. Much of the original fabric is still intact. This includes the sandstone flagging, most of the Flemish bond brick walls, one lathe and plaster ceiling, the entire roof structure except the shingles, one stall, one window and the majority of the doors, particularly the frames. Evidence of missing elements is clearly read from the remnant structure.

Heritage listing  St Matthew's Anglican Church is one of the finest works of early Colonial architecture remaining in Australia. The rectory stables have rare and state significance because of their association with William Cox the builder, Francis Greenway or Standish Harris as the Government Architect responsible for the design and because they complete the St Matthew's Anglican Church precinct (all buildings completed between 1810 - 1825). The stables are a reminder of the indispensability of the horses for nineteenth century clergy. The rectory stables dominate the landscape above the Hawkesbury flood plain, they form a highly visible landmark precinct. In the past the community has resisted attempts to demolish the stables and in recent times have formed a committee to conserve the stables.The brickwork and roof of the stables are evidence of early technical knowledge and construction techniques of the colony. If attributed to Standish Harris it is the only structure remaining from his period as Government Architect, other than a wall. St Matthew's Anglican Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Evidence of early settlement on the Cumberland Plain and of planning by Governor Macquarie. Consecrated by Samuel Marsden in 1822. The rectory stables has rare significance because of those involved in their design and erection. William Cox, the builder, was one of the principal building contractors and road makers in rural New South Wales in the Macquarie period and the 1820s. The design of the stables was the work of either Francis Greenway or of his successor as government architect, Standish Harris. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. A fine Georgian Church considered to be Francis Greenway's architectural masterpiece. It is one of the finest works of early Colonial architecture remaining in Australia. Rectory also a fine domestic work. Stables: On a dominating site above the floodplain of the Hawkesbury, with the Blue Mountains to the west, the sand stock brick stables, next to the celebrated rectory and near St Matthew's Anglican Church, forms a highly significant landmark element in the cultural landscape to the whole group, the stables shares the high state significance of the church and rectory. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Strong association with pioneer families and the history of the area. The Stables: as a domestic utility, barely visible from the roadway, for many years unlike the church or rectory, did not attract particular local esteem. In recent times however, concern among parishioners about the condition of the stables has let to the formation of a community committee specifically to be a task force for their conservation. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cemetery has research potential. Stables: The construction, both from brickwork and roof, is significant evidence of William Cox's style and also of the specifications drawn up by the government architect, whether Greenway or Harris. If the building is by Harris, it assumes still higher research significances the only structure, other than a wall, which can be attributed to this much maligned architect. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rare example of very fine work by Greenway. The stables are the final essential element in the superb Anglican church complex at Windsor (cemetery, glebe, St Matthew's church, rectory and stables) completed between 1810 and 1825. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Demonstrates early colonial settlement and its associated infrastructure. The stables are a physical reminder of the indispensability of the horse for a nineteenth century country clergyman performing parochial rounds and servicing outlying churches.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. It is often associated with the adjoining North Street residences, some of which shared ownership with the hotel at various times.  History  Indigenous history The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups.Proudfoot, 1987 The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport.Nichols, 2010 Colonial history Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. In 1794, the land on which the building now stands was first alienated for European purposes in a grant made by Francis Grose of thirty acres to Samuel Wilcox, who named it Wilcox Farm. It is likely that land clearance and agricultural activities as well as some building works took place during this period and during the subsequent of occupation. The former Wilcox Farm was incorporated into a larger holding of 1500 acres known as Peninsula Farm in the early nineteenth century. Governor Lachlan Macquarie replaced Governor Bligh, taking up duty on 1 January 1810. Under his influence the colony prospered. His vision was for a free community, working in conjunction with the penal colony. He implemented an unrivalled public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. Under his leadership Hawkesbury district thrived. He visited the district on his first tour and recorded in his journal on 6 December 1810: \\"After dinner I chrestened the new townships...I gave the name of Windsor to the town intended to be erected in the district of the Green Hills...the township in the Richmond district I have named Richmond...\\" the district reminded Macquarie of those towns in England, whilst Castlereagh, Pitt Town and Wilberforce were named after English statesmen. These are often referred to as Macquarie's Five Towns. Their localities, chiefly Windsor and Richmond, became more permanent with streets, town square and public buildings. History of the Court House Hotel In the 1840s a plan prepared for the auction of Peninsula Farm estate shows that the study area adjoined a large holding of fenced and cultivated paddocks, with ricks of hay standing on them. There appear to have been several buildings associated with these paddocks. One of these structures, a small square building labelled \\"new hut\\", stood at the back of the later allotment 18, behind 37-39 North Street. This was labelled the \\"rick yard\\", that is, a storage yard associated with the fields near-by. The Peninsula Farm was subdivided, with lots along North Street, Windsor, being developed throughout the nineteenth century (North Street named for Lieutenant Samuel North). It is likely this development was primarily residential in nature. 37-39 North Street was Allotment 18 of the Peninsula Farm Subdivision and was owned by Charles Campbell. In 1842, Allotment 18 was purchased by John Shearing. He also purchased the adjoining 35 North Street in 1842 and 31-33 North Street (see North Street residences) in 1843. The current building was built by Shearing between 1842 and 1846. The early use of the building is less well documented, though numerous sources report that it was built and/or operated as the Peninsula Hotel. In 1846, Shearing sold the property to Uriah Moses, a shopkeeper. In 1846-1848, a publican's license was granted for the Court House Hotel, named for its proximity to the nearby Windsor Court House. In 1861, after further changes of ownership, the property was sold to Thomas Chaseling, who used it as a private residence for some time. In November 1867, James Reardon held a publican's licence for the hotel. In the 1870s, the property possibly reverted to use as a public house, as it was reported to have been kept by Robert Leddra as the Court House Hotel in 1877. During the 1880s, the building was used by a private school. In the early twentieth century, the building is said to have been divided in half with a family in each half. In 1922, Thomas Chaseling willed the properties at 37-39 and 35 North Street to Thomasina Smith. Around a Windsor drainage plan shows what may have been a small double earth closest or privy on the back, northern fence line and another small building on the boundary with 35 North Street. In 1945, Thomasina Smith willed the properties to her five daughters, who subsequently sold them to Thelma Mullinger where they stayed in the ownership of the Mullinger family for many years. In 1974, the properties at 37-39 and 35 North Street were sold to John Fisher, who sold the properties one month later to the National Trust of Australia (NSW). The National Trust of Australia (NSW) classified the property in 1976 and undertook substantial repairs and renovations returning what had been subdivided into two flats to a single dwelling. The small double earth closest or privy on the back, northern fence line and another small building on the boundary with 35 North Street, present in the 1930s, were demolished by 1978 when a survey shows only a \\"rough timber shed\\" at the back of the property. The building appeared in television drama A Country Practice as the surgery of Dr Terrence Elliott. The former hotel building was subsequently sold back into private ownership.  Description  37-39 North Street is a two-storey building constructed from sandstock bricks with sandstone lintels, sills and verandah flagging. There is a cellar beneath the house. It has a number of out-buildings. Along with the North Street residences, the facades of the nineteenth century buildings are in a similar alignment along North Street and are sited close to the present street separated from it only by a narrow grassed footpath. All of the properties have substantial trees behind them and all have landscaped gardens in the immediate environs of the houses. An archaeological assessment has found that the site is \\"likely to encompass evidence that could relate to secondary buildings, yard and garden improvements, services and/or domestic wastes of approximately the mid-nineteenth century onwards\\", but unlikely that it will yield evidence from earlier than that date.

Balskus is an American chemical biologist, enzymologist, microbiologist, and biochemist born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1980. She has been on the faculty of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology department of Harvard University since 2011 and is currently the Morris Kahn Associate Professor. She has published more than 80 peer-reviewed papers and three book chapters. Since 2012 she has been invited to give over 170 lectures, has held positions on various editorial boards, and served as a reviewer for ACS and Nature journals among others. Balskus also currently serves as a consultant for Novartis, Kintai Therapeutics, and Merck & Co.  Early life and education  Balskus was already interested in a potential career in science in elementary school where she conducted a science fair experiment on dilution and conservation of matter. Later in high school she was introduced to chemistry and was \\"captivated by the excitement of manipulating molecules in lab.\\" Later in her scientific career this evolved into her fascination of how molecules are made in living organisms. In an interview for the Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists, Balskus reflects that she was likely inspired to go into science because all of her science teachers were women.Emily Balskus, 2019 Blavatnik National Laureate in Chemistry. Balskus received a B.A. with highest honor in chemistry, summa cum laude, in 2002 from Williams College, where she published her first paper on the synthesis of (-)-hennoxazole A in the lab of professor Thomas E. Smith. She then went on to the University of Cambridge as a Churchill Scholar where she earned a M.Phil. in chemistry in the lab of Steven V. Ley. Balskus received her Ph.D. with organic chemist, Eric Jacobsen, at Harvard in 2008. There she proposed the novel idea of using an asymmetric catalyst to control chemical bond formation across large, cyclic molecules to form the favored stereoisomer. She then made the switch from organic chemistry to chemical biology as she pursued a postdoctoral fellowship from 2008 through 2011 at Harvard Medical School with natural products researcher Christopher Walsh. Together they collaborated on the biosynthesis of scytonemin, a \\"microbial sunscreen\\" used to protect microorganisms from harmful UV light. In 2009 she became a member of the Microbial Diversity Summer Course at the Marine Biology Lab at Woods Hole and received training in microbial ecology and environmental microbiology.Emily https://www.microbialchemist.com/people/emily  Research  The Balskus lab's research is centered around the human microbiome, which is the trillions of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that live in and on us. These microorganisms include bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Because of the abundance of genes in the human microbiome (200 times the amount in the human genome) many enzymes and/or their mechanisms have not been characterized.Marilyn Hair & Jon Sharpe. The Center for Ecogenetics and Environmental Health, University of Washington, 1/2014. Two of Balskus' aims is therefore to elucidate the mechanisms by which these microbial enzymes perform chemistry and to identify the specific microbes, genes, and enzymes responsible for key metabolic activities. A third aim is to develop biocompatible methods to control, manipulate, and study microbial chemistry in situ.Emily Balskus, 2019 Blavatnik National Laureate in Chemistry. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_qFNuVJw8Q&feature;=emb_logo Bioinformatics is heavily applied in the Balskus lab in order to study the extensive amount of genes of the human microbiome. Bioinformatics is the \\"science of storing, retrieving and analysing large amounts of biological information.\\"What is bioinformatics? https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/bioinformatics- terrified/what-bioinformatics-0 Examples of bioinformatic analyses utilized in the Balskus lab are; phylogenetics, sequence alignments, homology modeling, and DNA annotation. A key accomplishment of the Balskus lab was the elucidation of the enzyme responsible for the already known conversion of choline to trimethylamine, choline trimethylamine-lyase. They identified the gene cluster required for the cleavage of the C-N bond of choline and hypothesized that it coded for a glycyl radical enzyme (GRE), a class of enzymes not previously reported to perform that type of chemistry. Sequence alignments of the gene cluster and previously functionally characterized glycyl radical enzymes as well as homology models of the suspected enzyme revealed the presence of conserved key glycine and cysteine residues in the active site, supporting the hypothesis that the enzyme is a member of the GRE family of enzymes. This research is important because choline metabolism has possible links to fish malodor syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease.Craciun, Smaranda; Balskus, Emily P. ‚ÄúMicrobial Conversion of Choline to Trimethylamine Requires a Glycyl Radical Enzyme.‚Äù Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 2012, 109, 21307‚Äì21312. doi:10.1073/pnas.1215689109 Another key publication, A prominent glycyl radical enzyme in human gut microbiomes metabolizes trans-4-hydroxy-L-prolineLevin, Benjamin J.*; Huang, Yolanda Y.*; Peck, Spencer C.; Wei, Yifeng; Martinez-del Campo, Ana; Marks, Jonathan A.; Franzosa, Eric A.; Huttenhower, Curtis; Balskus, Emily P. ‚ÄúA Prominent Glycyl Radical Enzyme in Human Gut Microbiomes Metabolizes trans-4-Hydroxy-L- Proline.‚Äù Science 2017, 355, aai8386. doi:10.1126/science.aai8386 outlines an important research approach utilized by Balskus and her team; chemically- guided functional profiling. First an enzyme family of interest is identified (in this case, the GRE family) and the amino acid sequences of all the members are compared. With the knowledge of the structures and functions of already characterized members of the enzyme family and the amino acid residues responsible, a sequence similarity network (SSN) is constructed to group together sequences of enzymes in clusters that share biological function. The SSN is used to interpret data generated by Short-BRED, a quantitative metagenomic analysis tool which uses the amino acid sequences of the enzyme family as input. Short-BRED identifies the unique sequence markers of each group of similar members and sequentially determines their abundance in the human microbiome. This tool can be used to identify uncharacterized members and prioritize their study based on their abundance. Biocompatible chemistry is another integral strategy in the Balskus lab. These transformations are defined as \\"non-enzymatic chemical reactions that interact with the metabolism of living organisms in a way that alters biological function.\\"Manipulating Microbes With Biocompatible Chemistry https://www.microbialchemist.com/biocompatible-chemistry They have been able to develop biocompatible cyclopropanation and hydrogenation reactions to alter the reactivity of microbes by using non-enzymatic catalysts, iron(III) phthalocyanine and palladium, respectively.Wallace, Stephen; Balskus, Emily P. ‚ÄúInterfacing Microbial Styrene Production with a Biocompatible Cyclopropanation Reaction.‚Äù Angew.

They found that a cyclopropane \\"warhead\\" breaks the DNA strands through an alkylation reaction.Wilson, Matthew R.*; Jiang, Yindi*; Villalta, Peter W.; Stornetta, Alessia; Boudreau, Paul D.; Carr√°, Andrea; Brennan, Caitlin A.; Chun, Eunyoung; Ngo, Lizzie; Samson, Leona D.; Engelward, Bevin P.; Garrett, Wendy S.; Balbo, Silvia; Balskus, Emily P. ‚ÄúThe human gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin alkylates DNA‚Äù Science 2019, 363, eaar7785. doi:10.1126/science.aar7785 Other areas of research investigated by the Balkus lab is microbe drug metabolism. In an interview with The Scientist magazine, Balskus pointed out that many drugs such as digoxin and byproducts of human metabolism can be degraded by gut bacteria, leading to lowered effects of these molecules than would be expected. Overall, the work done by the Balskus lab presents the foundational strategies needed to investigate the human microbiome and to understand how it affects our health. Their hope is to influence the development of therapeutic strategies that work not on the human host, but on their microbiome instead.Understanding the Human Microbiome https://www.microbialchemist.com/microbiome  Volunteering  Balskus was a co-organizer of the 2019 Keystone Conference on chemical and biological considerations of the gut microbiota.

The date of initial construction is unknown. Initially a four-room structure with a front verandah, it was expanded in the 1830s to include an additional three rooms to the south and a rear kitchen. It was licensed as the \\"New Inn\\" under Robert Potts from 1837 until 1839. It later operated as a store and private residence. It was saved from demolition in the 1980s, and incorporated into a motel development, the \\"New Inn Motel\\" in 1995. It now serves as a manager's residence for the motel at the rear of the property.Mottram, 2002  Description  Early nineteenth century building now used as motel manager's residence;  Heritage listing  49-51 Bosworth Street is an intact example of the more substantial town buildings erected in Richmond during the prosperous 1830s. It represents the style of building construction more substantial than the crude dwellings initially erected in the town. It has a strong association with a local entrepreneur, Isaac Cornwell, who was representative of the moderately successful second generation, native born colonist. It demonstrates the characteristic style of town buildings, construction techniques and building materials of house building in the 1830s-1840s. It is an example of utilising brick nog construction techniques of which only a small number (of known examples) remain today. It offers a valuable and meaningful comparison to Bowman's Cottage demonstrating both the evolution and continuation of building styles, techniques and materials.

It is also known as the Home of John Town and Heritage Cottage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Indigenous history The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups.Proudfoot, 1987 The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport.Nichols, 2010 Colonial history Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. On 1 January 1810, Lachlan Macquarie replaced William Bligh as Governor of New South Wales. Under Macquarie's influence the colony prospered. His vision was for a free community, working in conjunction with the penal colony. He implemented a substantial public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. Under his leadership Hawkesbury district thrived. He visited the district on his first tour and recorded in his journal on 6 December 1810: \\"After dinner I chrestened the new townships...I gave the name of Windsor to the town intended to be erected in the district of the Green Hills...the township in the Richmond district I have named Richmond...\\" the district reminded Macquarie of those towns in England, whilst Castlereagh, Pitt Town and Wilberforce were named after English statesmen. These are often referred to as Macquarie's Five Towns. Their localities, chiefly Windsor and Richmond, became more permanent with streets, town square and public buildings. 126 Windsor Street 126 Windsor St was built 1840 for ex-convict turned successful businessman John Town (senior) and his wife Mary Pickett. Town had arrived in Australia in 1800 and after gaining his freedom had operated a milling business at Kurrajong. In the late 1970s, the building was threatened with demolition for a planned car yard. Demolition had already commenced when the building was purchased by the state government on the advice of the Heritage Council of New South Wales, the first to be acquired under new heritage preservation powers. The work on 126 Windsor Street was intended to serve as an example of the way a building in poor condition which was threatened by demolition can be restored and given a new lease of life at a moderate cost.Heritage Office, s170 History The Heritage Council auctioned the property in 1985. It was at some stage used as \\"Heritage Cottage\\", a museum and coffee shop, but this is no longer operating. Description French windows 126 Windsor Street is a single-storey cottage of three bays with a two-storey wing running parallel to the side street. It is constructed of brick, stuccoed and painted on exterior. Main roof is hipped and of iron, verandah roof is supported on turned timber columns. Exterior joinery is mostly intact.

Description and history The Pistol Factory Dwelling is located in eastern Hamden, set on a knoll above Whitney Avenue just north of its junction with Mather Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, two asymmetrically placed brick chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with windows in a slightly asymmetrical placement around the main entrance. The entrance is flanked by fluted boards that resemble pilasters, sidelight windows, and another set of fluted boards, and is topped by a half-round transom window. The side gable ends have narrow horizontal windows in them, and there is a small shed-roof ell extending to the rear. With The house was built in 1845 by Eli Whitney II to house skilled workers at a pistol factory he had established nearby (on a site now flooded by Lake Whitney). The house was built as a single-pile three-bay structure, with a single-story ell to the side, which was later (before 1860) raised to match the main block in height. The house was eventually sold to one of its tenants, and was moved in 1940 to accommodate road work (but retaining its orientation to the roadway). It is the only structure that survives that is related to the pistol factory, whose site was flooded in 1861 by Whitney in a bid to improve water power for a combined arms factory further downstream.

It is part of the L√∂tschberg-Simplon axis between Germany and Italy. It was opened in 1859 by the Swiss Central Railway (Schweizerische Centralbahn).  History The line from Bern to Thun was opened by the Swiss Central Railway on 1 July 1859. The line began in Wylerfeld and used the line opened from Olten to Bern station in 1858. In 1861, it was extended by a little over a kilometre from Thun to Scherzligen, where there was a connection to the steamboats on Lake Thun. These were initially the only way for passengers to continue their trips. From 1873, freight wagons were carried on a ferry service to D√§rligen station on the B√∂deli Railway (B√∂delibahn), which at that time was operated as an island operation. It was not until 1893 that the Lake Thun Railway (Thunerseebahn) opened a connection to D√§rligen. With the construction of Thun station (1923) between the two old Thun stations and the building of the navigation canal between the lakes (1925), the two old stations lost their former function. The old Thun station was converted into a carriage depot. Passenger services at Scherzligen station were abandoned and it was converted into sidings for the new station. The Central Railway was one of the major private railways that were nationalised and the line passed into the possession of the Swiss Federal Railways (Schweizerische Bundesbahnen, SBB) on 1 January 1902. The route between Bern Wylerfeld and Ostermundigen was relocated in 1912. The new line, which had been built as double track, was put into operation on 20 May 1912. The old line ran from the points at the western approach to the carriage sidings at Wylerfeld, continuing south of the grosse Allmend to Ostermundigen. With the opening of the L√∂tschberg mountain railway in 1913, the line gained importance as a feeder to the Simplon Railway for transit traffic to Italy. It was then gradually converted to double track up to 1921 and electrified in 1918/1919. The first part of the Thun‚ÄìScherzligen line was electrified from 2 December 1918 to allow BLS trains to enter Thun station. Electrification of the rest of the line to Bern followed on 7 July 1919. It was the first electrified line of the SBB that was not operated only as a test track and it was the first line electrified with single-phase alternating current at 15,000 Volt and a frequency of 16.7 Herz. The reason why the track was electrified before the Gotthard Railway, was that the BLS had already completed a power station in 1913, while a power station had to be built before electrical operations could commence on the Gotthard. With the construction and commissioning of the Lorraine viaduct and the building of the approach to Bern station along Dammstrasse/West Ring in 1941, the line via the Red Bridge was abandoned. The new line was built with two tracks. Since 1941, four mainline tracks have operated between Bern station and Wylerfeld. The L√∂chligut‚ÄìWankdorf connecting line was put into operation on 21 May 1967. This ended the reversal of (through) freight trains at the oblique junction in Bern Wylerfeld, because freight trains are now able to run directly from Zollikofen to Ostermundigen. Allmendingen station, which had been opened on 20 July 1922, was closed at the timetable change in 1982 and public transport services to the community were replaced by a VBW/SZB bus service.  Operations In long- distance traffic, the line is served by InterCity services on the Interlaken‚ÄìBasel and Brig‚ÄìBasel/‚ÄìZ√ºrich‚ÄìRomanshorn routes as well as EuroCity services on the Milan‚ÄìBasel route. In local traffic, BLS AG operates line S1 of the Bern S-Bahn and the Bern‚ÄìBrig/‚ÄìZweisimmen RegioExpress service (using L√∂tschberger sets). Freight transport is dominated by through freight trains to Italy, including those on the rolling highway.

Lyons was born in Whitechapel, London, to German Jewish parents. He became a tailors' machiner, joining the Amalgamated Society of Tailors, and in time became the secretary of its Jewish branch. In 1885, he joined the Social Democratic Federation, and while attending one of its meetings he was arrested for obstructing the police. Because he was Jewish, he was given a harsh sentence of two months' imprisonment with hard labour, and a fine of 40 shillings. William Morris attended the court hearing, and was successful in getting the sentence overturned. The late 1880s saw much unemployment, and Lyons worked with Philip Krantz to organise the Jewish Unemployed Committee. He lobbied Hermann Adler, Chief Rabbi, to support unemployed Jewish workers, but Adler was entirely unsympathetic. In 1888, the East End Jewish Master Tailors' Association rejected a list of demands for better working conditions, submitted by Jewish tailors. A House of Lords Committee on the subject of sweatshop labour in tailoring also failed to make any recommendations. As a result, Lewis organised a strike, in conjunction with two small unions representing machiners and pressers. The strike gained support, and three weeks later, 6,000 tailors had stopped work, and John Burns, Tom Mann and Ben Tillett addressed meetings. On 12 September, the Jewish Master Tailors' Association proposed concessions, including a maximum twelve-hour working day, but withdrew them at the last moment, instead falsely claiming that agreement had been reached and the strike was over. This tactic was unsuccessful, and eventually on 3 October an agreement was reached, conceding all the union's demands, and also banning piece work. Following the strike, the smaller unions merged to form the International Tailors', Machiners' and Pressers' Trade Union, and Lyons agreed to become its full-time president. He campaigned for the removal of middlemen, and for wholesalers which manufactured goods to do so in their own workshops. This was opposed by the employers, and Lyons led a further strike, but the union's members were not fully in support, and at the end of 1891, it split. The part led by Lewis renamed itself as the International Journeyman Tailors', Machiners' and Pressers' Trade Union, and focused on enabling Jewish tailors to refuse to work on the Sabbath. In 1892, Lyons returned to campaigning on behalf of unemployed Jewish workers. On this occasion, he persuaded Adler to meet with him, but Adler made clear that he believe Lyons was overestimating the problem. Lyons continued this campaign for a few years, but as the union's membership fell, he decided to move to Bristol and open a cigar shop. Lyons returned to London in about 1900, where he repeatedly took on the leadership of small unions of Jewish tailors, but then resign or be dismissed on the grounds of his poor financial management and advocacy of a joint organisation of workers and small masters. In 1909, he established the London Tailors' Council, and was its first chair, but he began suffering from poor health and had to resign the post shortly afterwards.

It is found off of the eastern and western coasts of Australia, and lives in tropical and temperate waters 435‚Äî1,300 meters deep. Males and females grow to a maximum total length of 93.9 and 103.4 centimeters, respectively, and are brown in color.  Description  The total maximum length of the longspine chimaera for males is typically roughly 93.9 centimeters, and roughly 103.4 centimeters for females. It is brown in color and has deciduous skin, with males having short claspers 11-13% of their body length.  Distribution and conservation  The longspine chimaera occurs exclusively in waters off the coasts of Australia. It lives on the west coast in the eastern part of the Indian Ocean and on the east coast in the western Pacific Ocean, and is native to New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia. However, one specimen was seen near the coast of Tasmania, south of Victoria, on 1 April 1988. The population of the species or its relative trend is unknown, but it is not severely threatened. It is not a commercial target, but it is sometimes accidentally caught by trawls in deep waters. Most fisheries which operate in areas where the longspine chimaera lives, mostly fish in waters shallower than the typical depth range of the species. However, some fisheries, notably the Australian Commonwealth-managed Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery and the Coral Sea Fishery, catch fish in deeper waters, sometimes where the longspine chimaera occurs. This could be a potential threat to the species. There are currently no conservation actions occurring for this species, and as of February 2015, it is listed as Least Concern by IUCN.  Behavior and habitat  The longspine chimaera is a marine species, living in tropical waters and warmer temperate waters. It is most commonly found from waters 800 meters deep to 1,300 meters deep, although it often lives in waters as shallow as 435 meters in depth as well. The species is oviparous, like the rest of the species in the order Chimaeriformes. Besides this, very few biological facts are known about the longspine chimaera.

Born to a Jewish family in Eastern Europe, Finn became a tailors' machiner in Leeds, in England. He was fluent in both English and Yiddish, and became the Leeds correspondent of the Poilishe Yidel. He joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), and tried to promote solidarity between Jewish workers and socialists in the city. He remained with the SDF until 1885, when he was part of the breakaway which formed the Socialist League. In 1884, Finn worked with James Sweeney of the Jewish Tailors' Society to lead a strike. This was unsuccessful, as the union had no funds and so could not provide strike pay. The following year, Finn led a further strike, calling for a reduction in the length of the working day. This was better planned, and strikebreakers imported from London were given pre-paid return train tickets to encourage them to leave. This was successful, but Finn faced victimisation by employers and struggled to find work, instead relocating to Boston, Massachusetts. In America, Finn continued working in tailoring, and was also active in the local socialist group. In 1893, he returned to England, this time settling in the East End of London, and in 1895 he was elected as secretary of the London United Ladies' Tailors' Trade Union. He also wrote a pamphlet, Voice of the Alien, arguing that Eastern European workers were not taking the jobs of English people, but were instead contributing to the economy.

The church was designed by Edmund Blacket and built from 1819 to 1859 by James Atkinson, senior; and the schoolhouse was built by John Brabyn. The church is also known as the St. John's (Blacket) Church, while the hall (former schoolhouse) is also known as the Macquarie Schoolhouse/Chapel and the Wilberforce Schoolhouse. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 August 2010.  History  The Darug (various spellings) occupied the area from Botany Bay to Port Jackson north-west to the Hawkesbury and into the Blue Mountains. The cultural life of the Darug was reflected in the art they left on rock faces. Before 1788, there were probably 5,000 to 8,000 Aboriginal people in the Sydney region. Of these, about 2,000 were probably inland Darug, with about 1,000 living between Parramatta and the Blue Mountains. They lived in bands of about 50 people, and each band hunted over its own territory. The Gommerigal-tongarra lived on both sides of South Creek. The Boorooboorongal lived on the Nepean from Castlereagh to Richmond.Kohen, 1993, pp. 6‚Äì8 Little information was collected about the Aborigines of the Hawkesbury before their removal by white settlement so details of their lifestyle have to be inferred from the practices of other south-eastern Aborigines. It is believed they lived in bark gunyahs. The men hunted game and the women foraged for food. On 15 December 1810, Macquarie issued an Order laying out five towns along the Hawkesbury River. One at Green Hills would be called Windsor. Another at Richmond Hill District would be called Richmond. A third in the Nelson district would be named Pitt Town. The village in the Phillip district would be called Wilberforce and the fifth in the Evan district was Castlereagh. Nearby settlers would be allotted sites on these towns to build.HRNSW, 7, pp 469-70 Reverend Samuel Marsden was instructed by Macquarie on 2 February 1811 to consecrate the burial grounds at the new towns on the Hawkesbury including Wilberforce. Surveyor Evans would show him the areas set aside.SRNSW 4/3490D, p. 97 Macquarie Schoolhouse Macquarie's Instructions from the Colonial Office included not just the establishment of towns but also the creation of schools, a policy with which Macquarie was in complete agreement. His Order of 11 May 1811 strongly recommended to parents and family heads \\"The Education and Instruction of the Youth of both Sexes being an Object of the utmost Importance, as laying the Foundation of many Advantages to the rising Generations\\". Macquarie encouraged local residents to fund and establish schools themselves but also assisted with government funds.Barkley & Nichols, 1994, p. 45 His Order of 11 May 1811 encouraged the establishment of schoolhouses at the initiative of local communities and promised to contribute A¬£25 of government money to each schoolhouse. At the same time, he directed that settlers should no longer bury their dead on their farms but in the burial grounds consecrated and measured out \\"some time since\\" in places such as Wilberforce.Sydney Gazette, 18 May 1811, p. 1 Schoolhouses were often used for religious purposes until churches were erected near them in the 1850s. These combined schoolhouses, chapels and schoolmaster's residences were a feature of early Macquarie towns on the Hawkesbury. They were built at Castlereagh, Wilberforce, Pitt Town and Richmond often sited in commanding positions with a square nearby.HRA, 1, X, 692‚Äì3 Reverend Cartwright was paid A¬£10 before 1 July 1812 for \\"inclosing the Burial Ground at the Township of Wilberforce\\".Sydney Gazette, 24 October 1812, p2 Macquarie's journal noted he visited Wilberforce on 21 May 1813 to mark the site for a new schoolhouse.Waymark, 1970, np.

On 20 April 1818 he informed Samuel Marsden that apart from schools in major centres there were also inferior schools at places such as Wilberforce teaching the rudiments of education.HRA, I, 9, 780-1 In 1819, a new brick building replaced the earlier temporary one.Wymark, 1970, np Convicted London joiner and carpenter James Gough (1790-1876) who arrived on the Earl Spencer in 1813 and gained his conditional pardon in 1821, won the private contract to build a school at Wilbeforce.Dalkin, 2014, 31 By 30 September 1819, John Brabyn had been paid A¬£200 for \\"erecting a School-house and temporary Place of Worship at Wilberforce\\".Sydney Gazette, 8 January 1820, p2 On 31 May 1820, D Wentworth paid Brabyn an additional A¬£85/16/1 for enlarging and completing the School House.Wentworth Papers, ML D1, p 217d. This may have funded the skillion at the rear. The skillion addition seems to have been an afterthought to accommodate the schoolmaster but seems to be almost contemporary with the main building as the brick work and fireplace are bonded into the main building. It has been claimed that it was built of sun- dried bricks with stone quoins and was whitewashed with lime to which fat had been added to protect it from the weather. However, in the absence of documentary proof or physical analysis to confirm it this claim cannot be verified. The original roof was of open timberwork with three tie beams. Shutters originally protected the windows. At a later stage, verandahs were added on the western, southern and part of the eastern side. In September 1821, the Sydney Gazette reported that there were \\"thriving and ably-conducted Public Schools\\" at Wilberforce, Pitt Town and Richmond.Sydney Gazette, 29 September 1821, p. 2 The Schoolmaster at Wilberforce was William Gow who lived in the lower rooms.

The schoolhouse was no longer used as a church after the new St John's Church was completed in 1859. The land had not yet been vested in the Church. On 9 August 1858, surveyor Charles S Whitaker transmitted his plan of the allotment in Wilberforce for the Church of England Church, School and Parsonage. The plan showed the new Church along Macquarie Street and the school building at the rear, plus fencing and some topography.C.697.730, Crown Plan On 16 July 1863, an area of 7 acres 2 roods and 15 perches at Wilberforce, part of Section 13, was dedicated to the public for a Church of England Church, School and Parsonage.C T 142 f 201 A formal grant for the school site was not issued until 16 February 1872. An area of 3 acres 1 rood 21 perches was granted to William Bragg, John Henry Fleming and James Rose Buttsworth as trustees of the schoolhouse site (T-shaped parcel of land) under Church of England. On the same day, the church and parsonage sites on either side were also granted.C T 142 f 200, f 202 In 1864, Inspector McCredie reported to the Council of Education that the schoolhouse was much in need of repair. In 1865, he reported it had been repaired for A¬£80.Wymark, 1970, np. Varying dates have been given for the closure of the building as a school. One source gives the date as 1874. However, Wilberforce was not on the 1879 list of Denominational Schools closed since 1872.V & P L A N S W, 1879-80, volume 3, p. 353 The 1880 list of Anglican Denominational Schools operating listed one at Wilberforce with 42 pupils enrolled.V & P L A N S W, 1880-1, volume 2, p 243 The new Public School opened on 6 July 1880 and the older schoolhouse apparently closed that year. The 1881 list of Anglican Denominational Schools did not include one at Wilberforce.V & P L A N S W, 1882, volume 2, p. 780 Thereafter, it seems to have been used as a church hall. When surveyor Charles Robert Scrivener surveyed Wilberforce on 22 August 1894, his plan showed the \\"Old Church\\" i.e. schoolhouse and the \\"New Church\\".C.1610.1507, Crown Plan A drawing of the schoolhouse by William Johnson dated about 1900 showed what appeared to be a brick building with a shingle roof, five multi-paned sash windows on the upper floor and four on the lower with central doorway and verandah at front, apparently also shingled. A brick chimney was at the side.PIC R80 LOC672-B, NLA A verandah was added on the western side at an unknown date clad with shingles later replaced by corrugated iron. The exterior was cement rendered in 1911 to arrest the fretting of the brickwork and the skillion was also cement rendered shortly afterwards. A photograph by Kerry & Co dated from 1890 (copied in 1932) showed the roof as shingled.SLV H18463 A photograph of 1920 showed the schoolhouse with a shingled roof.Barkley & Nichols, 1994, p. 56 Another photograph dated as 1937 showed the roof clad with corrugated iron, suggesting that it was re- roofed in the 1920s or 1930s.Bowd, 1994, p. 148 The former steep staircase was replaced by one with a gentler grade in 1966. The original shutters have disappeared. A photograph of 1970 in Wymark showed the original multi-paned windows replaced by what appear to be double-hung sash windows. Another photo in Wymark which is not as clear suggests that the windows had been replaced as early as 1920. A fire in 1985 meant much of the roof and interior timberwork was replaced. A tombstone for John Howorth (died 1804) located on the south side of the Macquarie schoolhouse was moved here in 1960 from the farm near the river south of the village where he was originally buried. It is also included in this listing. It demonstrates burial practices on the Hawkesbury before official cemeteries were established there in Macquarie's period as governor.  St John's Church  At a public meeting on 4 November 1846 called by Reverend T. C. Ewing, public support for building a new church for Wilberforce was sought. The schoolroom used as a place of worship was no longer large enough for the congregation and according to Joshua Vickery \\"a school-room was not a proper place in which to worship\\". A committee was formed to erect the new church and a sum of A¬£100/15/0 was subscribed. If A¬£300 could be raised they were entitled to government aid.SMH, 9 Nov 1846, pp. 2‚Äì3 By February 1848, a plan of the proposed church prepared by Edmund Blacket, was available for viewing at the schoolhouse.SMH, 24 Feb 1848, p. 1 A grant of A¬£450 was approved by the Executive Council of NSW in 1850 to erect the church. Reverend T C Ewing informed the Colonial Secretary on 24 January 1854 that construction of the church had been delayed by the gold rushes. He asked if the funds in support were still available.CSIL58/3344 SRNSW 4/3384 The builder was James Atkinson. On 13 August 1856, James Atkinson, senior, builder of Windsor advertised for \\"three or four good Quarrymen and three or four good Masons, to perform the work of a Church\\".SMH, 13 Aug 1856 p. 1 Reverend Frederic Barker, Bishop of Sydney, laid the foundation stone of the new church on 17 December 1856.SMH, 22 Dec 1856, p. 2 After architect Edmund T. Blacket approved the work completed up to 27 April 1857 by J Atkinson amounting in value to A¬£648, the bulk of funds voted by parliament were transferred to the church. Alexander Dawson, the Colonial Architect, valued the work at A¬£1,310 on 11 September 1858. The balance of A¬£20 of the grant was then paid to the church on 17 September 1858. The Bishop of Sydney consecrated the new church on 12 April 1859 and 29 people were confirmed.SMH, 16 April 1859 p 5 The teacher at the school, John Wenban, presented a sundial to the church at its consecration and it remains in place.Church of England Historical Society Journal, 15, 4, Dec 1970, p. 90 A photograph by Kerry & Co dated from 1890 (copied in 1932) showed the church roof as shingled. A photograph of 1920 also showed the church with a shingled roof. The roof was reclad with fibro slates in 1950. In 1914, the interior and exterior stonework was tuckpointed. An oak Communion Table and Reredos were presented by the parishioners to the church at the centenary of the schoolhouse/chapel. Electric light was installed in St John's Church in 1934. In 1970, three hanging kerosene lamps were still suspended from the ceiling. The east and west windows ( and 1878) are memorials to Dunston family members. The Dunston family was one with a long association with the district and church. John Henry Fleming's memorial window () commemorates another with a close association with the church.  Description   Macquarie Schoolhouse  The Macquarie School House at Wilberforce is the only surviving example of a small number of school houses which combined a schoolroom and schoolmaster's residence with the schoolroom serving as a church on Sundays. The school house is a two-storey Colonial Georgian building with a hipped roof and ground floor verandah to the west and south. The verandah roof returns along the east side where it becomes part of a rear skillion. The front facade, facing west, is divided into five bays. The former schoolhouse is constructed of brick. The bricks to the main building are soft bricks of local red clay. It is not clear whether the bricks were fired or were just sundried. The few bricks in the original part of the building that are visible have lost their outside skin. The bricks to the skillion appear to be of a different clay, suggesting that the skillion was a slightly later addition. Render on the external walls and plaster on the internal walls makes it difficult to assess these bricks in detail. The roof is sheeted in galvanised steel with close eaves and the walls are rendered with ashlar coursing. The render dates from . Sandstone quoins are on the corners of the front (west) elevation. There are two corbelled brick chimneys, one on the north side and one on the east. Both chimneys are expressed on the external face of the wall. The framing to the verandah is not original. When the verandah was replaced, the verandah roofline was also altered at the southeast corner. The skillion meets the wall of the main building at a higher level than the verandah. Early photos show the roof of the skillion continuing across the full length of the east side. The verandah roof now returns around the southeast corner to meet the south wall of the skillion. Windows to the ground floor are nine over six pane double hung sashes to the original part of the building. The skillion has windows with six over six pane double-hung sashes. Windows to the first floor are six over six pane double-hung sashes and are unusual in having a deep timber frame at the head. All the windows in the main part of the building have timber lintels. Those in the skillion have low brick arches. The doors are ledged and sheeted with beaded boards. The front door retains its original gudgeon pins and iron brackets for the internal security rail. It is in an arched opening with a rendered panel above the transom. A series of plaques on the south wall of the building record the construction and development of the building and commemorate a number of the schoolmasters who served at the school. Internally, the building has a simple layout. The ground floor of the main part of the building has two rooms and a stair hall. The skillion also has two rooms connected by a very low door. The first floor is a single large room. A later six panelled door connects the north room of the main building to the north room of the skillion. The walls of the ground floor rooms are plastered. Ceilings in the ground floor of the main part of the building are sheeted and battened, ceilings in the skillion are ripple iron. The first floor has exposed roof framing. Three heavy timber tie beams that appear to be original survive. The main roof framing and boards above were replaced after the 1985 fire. The fireplace at the north end of the first floor retains some elements of the original timber chimneypiece. A headstone for John Howorth (died 1804), now located next to the schoolhouse, is included in the listing. It was moved in the 1960s from its original location where he was buried on a Hawkesbury farm . It dates from the period before the establishment of the burial ground at Wilberforce when the dead were buried on their farms. It is believed to be the oldest known tombstone from the Hawkesbury region.Jack, 1986:84 The site contains a significant view corridor from the verandah of the Schoolhouse to the Wilberforce Cemetery. St John's Church St John's Anglican Church is a Victorian Academic Gothic style church set at an angle to the street to enable the church to face east. The church is a simple gabled building of four bays, with a gabled chancel at the east end, a gabled porch on the south side and a gabled vestry on the north side of the chancel. The church has a steeply pitched roof of compressed cement sheet shingles, replacing the original timber shingles. Modern colorbond barge flashings have replaced the original exposed ends of the shingles and battens. The roof steps down at the east end to mark the narrowing of the church for the chancel. The body of the walls of the church are of pointed sandstone, with smooth-faced stone around the narrow pointed arched windows. The walls have been repointed in cementious mortar. At the west end is an elegant belfry, still with its bell. The windows are framed in metal and have diamond pattern leadlight to the top and bottom sashes. The central sash is a pivot sash. Taller stained glass windows are at the east and west ends. The doors are framed and sheeted in pointed-arched openings. Moulded timber battens have been applied to the external face of the doors to emphasise the appearance of vertical joints. A simple iron handrail is on the side of the southern entry porch. An important feature on the north wall is the original sundial, still marking the time with accuracy. It is painted with the hours of the day in Roman numerals, the date 1859 and the initials of its creator John Wenban. Internally, the church retains its original sandstone walls, although these have been painted in the vestry. It is not known whether the exposed cedar hammerbeam roof trusses and timber boarding are original fabric. The internal fixtures and fittings are largely non-original fabric. These include: the cedar pulpit, dado and altar rail in the chancel: the gothic style cedar altar; the iron cord cleats fixed to cedar roses on the windows, and brass hooks holding iron brackets for candles that are fixed to the cedar roses. An oak Communion Table and Reredos date from 1920. Around the walls of the church are a variety of memorial tablets commemorating notable local citizens, former ministers and those lost in war as well as tablets marking commemorative events. The two light East window is a memorial to Elizabeth Dunston who died in 1899 and her husband John Dunston who had died in 1876. Another window in the nave is in memory of John Fleming, who died in 1894. The West end windows are in memory of John Thomas Dunstan, who died in 1878. The manufacturer is not known.  St John's Church  St John's Church is substantially intact in its form, setting and external appearance apart from the replacement of the original timber shingle roof with cement sheet shingles. Much of the internal detail and fittings is also intact. Some sandstone blocks have weathered more quickly than others but most are in excellent condition. Some of the joints on the keystones over the northern and southern entry porches have cracked but apart from a small crack where the southern wall joins the south-east buttress, the rest of the joints appear to be in fine condition. A few asbestos slates on the roof are slipping. Overall, the church appears to be in excellent condition. As the location of the original temporary schoolhouse/chapel, one of the earliest known buildings in Wilberforce, which pre-dates the current 1819 Macquarie schoolhouse/chapel, this site has archaeological potential. Since the location of the original school/chapel building is not known, potentially the whole site is involved. Although modified over the years and repaired after fire damage, the Macquarie Schoolhouse still retains its original form and fenestration. Some of the internal joinery, notably the roof tie-beams, and the hardware on some doors still survives. In view of its age, the Schoolhouse has a high degree of original fabric. St John's Church is intact in its form and setting apart from the replacement of the original timber shingle roof with cement sheet shingles. Much of the internal detail and fittings are non-original fabric.

His scheme of establishing a school, church and burial ground at an elevated and/or central position was completely realised at Wilberforce during his governorship. He chose the sites of the town, church and burial ground personally. His creation of these towns in 1810 was an important expression of the developmental philosophy of settlement coupled with deliberate social engineering to control convict society and to implant a moral economy into their lifestyles. The establishment of the Schoolhouse demonstrated the importance Governor Macquarie attached to educating the children of the emancipated convicts of the Hawkesbury who constituted the rising generation of colonial freeborn. Of all the church/school/cemetery centres established in the four towns where this combination was established (i.e. Castlereagh, Pitt Town, Wilberforce and Richmond) the combination at Wilberforce is the one which is mostly intact, with the schoolhouse surviving from his governorship in conjunction with the cemetery in a commanding position above the town. By laying out the village, selecting the site of the square, church and cemetery, plus promoting the construction of the schoolhouse-cum-chapel, Governor Lachlan Macquarie left his personal signature on the village of Wilberforce. The curtilage includes the significant view corridor from the verandah of the Schoolhouse to Wilberforce Cemetery. The church of St John completed in 1859 to the design of architect Edmund T Blacket added an additional element which secured the continued use of this site for its original purpose by enabling the congregation to continue meeting in a building which could accommodate them all. St John's Anglican Church is a fine example of a simple rural church in the Victorian Gothic style by the esteemed nineteenth-century architect Edmund Blacket. Blacket designed over 100 churches, of which over 30 were small churches often in rural locations for small congregations. Designed in 1847 and erected between 1857 and 1859, St John's Church at Wilberforce is intact in its form and setting and a fine example of Blacket's early, small rural churches. The church has a rare example of a vertical sundial in Australia, the work of the former schoolmaster, John Wenban. St John's Anglican Church and Macquarie Schoolhouse was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 August 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It meets this criterion of State significance because the Wilberforce Schoolhouse was erected to meet the desire of Governor Lachlan Macquarie to promote education and religion at the core of the towns he laid out on the Hawkesbury. His scheme of establishing a school, church and burial ground at an elevated and/or central position was fully realised at Wilberforce during his governorship. He chose the sites of the town, church and burial ground personally. His creation of these towns on the Hawkesbury in 1810 was an important expression of the developmental philosophy of settlement coupled with deliberate social engineering to control convict society and to implant a moral economy and education of the young into their lifestyles. The establishment of the Schoolhouse demonstrated the importance Governor Macquarie attached to educating the children of the emancipated convicts of the Hawkesbury who constituted the rising generation of colonial freeborn. Of all the church/school/cemetery centres established in these towns, Wilberforce is the one which is most intact, with the schoolhouse surviving from his governorship in conjunction with the cemetery in a commanding position above the town. The Schoolhouse is also significant as the location of the annual muster from 1823. The site includes the significant view corridor from the verhadah of the Schoolhouse to the Wilberforce Cemetery. The church of St John completed in 1859 to the design of architect Edmund T Blacket added an additional element which secured the continued use of this site for its original purpose by enabling the congregation to continue meeting in a building which could accommodate them all. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. It meets this criterion of State significance because the Wilberforce Schoolhouse and its site have a close association with Governor Lachlan Macquarie. It was erected to meet his desire to promote education and religion at the core of the towns he laid out on the Hawkesbury. His scheme of establishing a school, church and burial ground on an elevated and/or central position was fully realised at Wilberforce during his governorship. He chose the sites of the town, church and burial ground personally. His creation of these towns in 1810 was an important expression of the developmental philosophy of settlement coupled with deliberate social engineering to control convict society and to implant a moral economy into their lifestyles. The establishment of the Schoolhouse demonstrated the importance Governor Macquarie attached to educating the children of the emancipated convicts of the Hawkesbury who constituted the rising generation of colonial freeborn. Not only did he establish the policy regarding the towns and their schools-cum-chapels but he personally visited the sites to select the best positions. By laying out the village, selecting the site of the square, church and cemetery, plus promoting the construction of the schoolhouse-cum-chapel, Governor Lachlan Macquarie left his personal signature on the village of Wilberforce. Of all the church/school/cemetery centres established in the towns, this is the one which is most intact, with the schoolhouse surviving from his governorship in conjunction with the cemetery in a commanding position above the town. The Schoolhouse is also significant as the location of the annual muster from 1823. The church of St John was completed in 1859 to the design of architect Edmund T Blacket who was a church architect of considerable significance since his Gothic style churches largely created the ecclesiastical style of building so strongly associated with the Victorian era in NSW. Wilberforce Schoolhouse and St John's are also associated with John Wenban, a noted early schoolteacher who taught at the school for many years and who donated the unusual sundial which graces the exterior of St John's Church. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Macquarie schoolhouse is of high aesthetic significance as a surviving and reasonably intact substantial Old Colonial Georgian building. Changes to the building have not altered its original form and symmetry. Deliberately sited near one of the highest points in the town to ensure the prominence of the church in the burgeoning community, with the adjacent church it remains a focal point in the townscape. St John's Anglican Church is a fine example of a simple rural church in the Victorian Gothic style by the esteemed nineteenth-century architect Edmund Blacket. Blacket designed over 100 churches, of which over 30 were small churches often in rural locations for small congregations. Designed in 1847 and erected between 1857 and 1859, St John's Church at Wilberforce is intact in its form and setting and a fine example of Blacket's early, small rural churches. The church has a rare example of a vertical sundial in Australia, the work of the former schoolmaster, John Wenban. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It meets this criterion of State significance because the Macquarie schoolhouse was the focus for education in Wilberforce until the 1870s whilst the schoolhouse and its successor St John's Church in association with its cemetery have been the core of religious activity in Wilberforce until the present day providing an unbroken chain of use and association for the community stretching back for nearly 200 years. The present church community at Wilberforce is a strong one, with worshippers drawn from beyond the Hawkesbury and is larger than the size of the village would suggest. A number of services are held each Sunday. The Blacket church is used for a traditional service in the morning for those who prefer that form of worship. The commanding position of the site, with the schoolhouse and St John's Church, plus the associated burial ground, have provided a strong and visible focus for community identity. The Hawkesbury was an important focus for early settlement from the 1790s. As the community grew, younger sons and the adventurous set out to settle newer lands, a process that continued throughout the nineteenth century. Since Wilberforce was one of the hearthlands of early Australia from which numerous families and individuals ventured forth to settle new lands and establish new communities elsewhere, it possesses a strong attraction for a broad spectrum of people who live beyond the district and draws them back to visit and refresh their family associations with Wilberforce. Church and cemetery are invariably a goal for many such visitors. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As the sole surviving example of a Macquarie town, with the original church/schoolhouse and cemetery still at the core of the village design as laid out by Macquarie, it meets this criterion of State significance. Only at Wilberforce is there tangible physical evidence of the manner in which Macquarie implemented his policy of social engineering through town planning with the civilising elements of education and religion at the core. A combined school and church at the centre of town or in a high position, coupled with a cemetery where all people were directed to inter their dead continually exposed former convicts to these influences with greater or lesser impact. The loss of key elements of the same combinations in the other towns he established means that only at Wilberforce can the full physical, sensory and aesthetic impact of this scheme be experienced. As a site with early buildings, most notably the original temporary schoolhouse/chapel one of the earliest known buildings in Wilberforce which pre-dates the current 1819 Macquarie schoolhouse/chapel, the site has archaeological potential. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It meets this criterion of State significance because Governor Lachlan Macquarie's scheme of establishing a school, church and burial ground on an elevated and/or central position was fully realised at Wilberforce during his governorship. Of the four towns he established where Macquarie laid out a schoolhouse/chapel ‚Äì Castlereagh, Pitt Town, Wilberforce and Richmond ‚Äì only the Wilberforce example survives. The loss of elements of similar groups in other Macquarie towns or the loss of the inter-connectness of their parts means that the Macquarie Schoolhouse and St John's Church are arguably the purest expressions today of what Lachlan Macquarie sought to establish as key anchor points in his townscapes and in his programme of civilising convict society and ameliorating its less moral elements. His creation of these towns was an important expression of the developmental philosophy of settlement coupled with deliberate social engineering to control convict society and to implant a moral economy into their lifestyles. Of all the church/school/burial ground combinations established in the towns, Wilberforce is the one which is most intact, with the schoolhouse surviving from his governorship in conjunction with the cemetery in a commanding position above the town. The church of St John completed in 1859 to the design of architect Edmund T Blacket added an additional element which secured the continued use of this site for its original purpose. The elements of schoolhouse, church and cemetery are inter-dependent. Views between the different elements reinforce the power of religion and education and the hope that they would reinforce each other in re-making a new more moral society. Views into and out of the site intensified that objective. The school and church looked down from a commanding position. One had to look upwards to view the church and school. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It meets this criterion of State significance because the Wilberforce Macquarie Schoolhouse and burial ground with its later addition of the Blacket church are the epitome of what Lachlan Macquarie wished to implement as demonstrable elements of power, education and religion. The loss of elements of similar groups in the other Macquarie towns or the loss of the inter-connectedness of their parts means that the Macquarie Schoolhouse and St John's are arguably the purest expressions today of what Lachlan Macquarie sought to establish as key anchor points in his townscapes and in his programme of civilising convict society and ameliorating its less moral elements. St John's Anglican Church is a good representative example of the Victorian Gothic church. Features that are typical of the style include the steeply pitched roof, high quality stonework, belfry, chancel and narrow pointed arched windows. The simplicity of the church is a feature of his designs for rural churches and it is a fine and largely intact example of his rural work. Edmund Thomas Blacket designed over 100 churches, of which over 30 were small churches often in rural locations for small congregations. St John's Church of England at Wilberforce was one of his small rural churches, designed in 1847 and erected between 1857 and 1859. Comparable small churches include St Mark's, Picton (1850‚Äì7), St John the Evangelist, Hartley (1857‚Äì9), St James, Pitt Town (1857‚Äì9) and Holy Trinity, Berrima (1849‚Äì). A small later church built for a modest rural community is All Saints, Condobolin (1878‚Äì9). Though there is no definite evidence that he designed it, circumstantial evidence points to Blacket as the designer. Many other churches designed by E T Blacket were for large towns such as Wellington and Goulburn or for Sydney or its suburbs, which were of a different order and scale to his smaller rural churches. St John's Anglican Church is a fine example of a simple rural church in the Victorian Gothic style by the esteemed nineteenth-century architect Edmund Blacket. Blacket designed over 100 churches, of which over 30 were small churches often in rural locations for small congregations. Designed in 1847 and erected between 1857 and 1859, St John's Church at Wilberforce is intact in its form and setting and a fine example of Blacket's early, small rural churches.

Young worked in a clothing factory in Leeds. He was a founder member of the Leeds Wholesale Clothing Operatives' Union in 1889, and was elected as its first general secretary. Employers in Leeds announced that any members of the union would be blacklisted, but Young avoided this by recording membership in secret. Although the Factory Times complained that it should not have avoided confrontation in this way, the tactic proved successful, and by 1893 the union had more than 1,000 members. From the start, Young had hoped to expand the union across the UK, and in 1894 he negotiated a merger with the Bristol Clothing Operatives' Union, forming the Amalgamated Union of Wholesale Clothing Operatives (AUCO). That year, the union announced a strike in opposition to wage cuts for pressers. Cutters, who were exempt from the cuts, opposed the strike action, and many resigned from the union. However, the action was backed by the Amalgamated Jewish Tailors', Machinists' and Pressers' Trade Union, and also by the new Independent Labour Party. The strike was resolved in May, but the union's finances were greatly depleted. Under Young's leadership, the union continued to grow, and by 1900 it had fourteen branches across the country, and by 1915 this had grown to 36 branches, with a total of 12,000 members. That year, the AUCO merged into the United Garment Workers' Trade Union and, although Young was in poor health, he was elected as its secretary, serving until 1920, when it became part of the Tailor and Garment Workers' Union. Young became the treasurer of the new union. He also served on the management committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions, until at least 1927.

He was a retainer of Lord Pingyuan, namely Zhao Sheng. Mao lived in Zhao for three years but success eluded him. In 257 BC, after the Battle of Changping, Zhao refused to cede territory to the Qin. As a result, Qin attacked Handan, the capital of Zhao. On its part, Zhao sought assistance from the Chu state. Mao Sui recommended himself to the Chu State and was successful in persuading the Chu to assist Zhao. In return, Mao Sui gained fame, and it was widely believed that: \\"A good tongue of Mao Sui is stronger than a million soldiers.\\"  Biography   Background  Mao Sui was born in Jize. Acknowledged for outstanding intelligence and talent as a young man, he succeeded in both academic and military training. He went to Handan, the capital of Zhao, and was introduced to Lord Pingyuan. Pingyuan had more than 3,000 retainers that had been employed in various capacities, such as civil and military strategists, guardians, butchers, liquor sellers, etc. In 257 BC, Qin army besieged Handan. Having realized that Handan was endangered, Mao Sui helped the Chu and Zhao form an alliance. He was then awarded the position of imperial adviser by the king of Zhao.  Mao Sui zi jian  During the Warrior states period, after the Battle of Changping, Qin had completely vanquished Zhao. The army general of Qin, Bai Qi wanted to push his advantage and lead soldiers to besiege the capital of Zhao, Handan. Qin's army went ahead and besieged Handan, and the situation was extremely dangerous. The king of Zhao ordered Prince Ping Yuan to ask for help from the Chu. Prince Ping Yuan summoned all his attendants and selected 20 civil and military officers to go together. He had already picked 19 attendees, and only one remained to be picked. At this point, Mao Sui came forward and recommended himself to Prince Ping Yuan. He said: \\"My lord, I heard that you will go to the Chu state to sign covenant with them. You also wish to take 20 attendants with you, but now there is still one person missing, so I want to follow you to Chu state.\\" Prince Ping Yuan asked him: \\"How long have you been with me?\\" \\"3 years,\\" he answered. Prince Ping Yuan said: \\"A talented person is like an awl in the bag, the awl will poke the bag and show its ability immediately. You have been with me for 3 years but did not show your ability, I have never heard of you. This is because you do not have any talents. Therefore, you cannot follow with us, just stay behind!\\" Mao Sui answered: \\"My lord, today is the date when I ask you to put me in your bag. I will show up my ability. If you had put me in the bag earlier, I may have already pierced the whole bag!\\" Finally, Prince Ping Yuan agreed and included Mao Sui in the group. When Prince Ping Yuan and his attendants arrived at the Chu, the king of Chu only met Prince Ping Yuan. They negotiated from morning till afternoon in the palace, but it did not yield any concrete results. Mao Sui strode up the steps and shouted from afar: \\"The matter of sending troops is either harmless or profitable. It is very simple and clear, then why do you still hesitate?\\" Mao Sui had interrupted their conversation. This angered the king, and he asked Prince Ping Yuan: \\"Who is he?\\" Prince Ping Yuan answered: \\"He is Mao Sui, he is my attendant.\\" The king shouted to Mao Sui: \\"Get out! I am talking to your master, how dare you! Why do you interrupt us?\\" Mao Sui realized that the king was angry. He was not afraid, but moved even closer to the monarch. He held his sword to the king and said: \\"Your Majesty, the reason you have the courage to yell at me is simply because you are the king with many bodyguards. But now no one can protect you, I can just cut your head off immediately. Your Majesty, your life is in my hands!\\" The king was scared and decided to listen to him. Mao Sui did not ask for help from Chu directly. He persuaded the king from another angle. He said: \\"Qin defeated you in the battle of Yanying and (the army general Bai Qi led the soldiers to defeat Chu in this battle. The capital of Chu, Yan, was lost and soldiers from Qin also burned the king's tomb of Chu and killed thousands of people). You lost your capital and retreated to Chen (current Henan province), your people were killed, and your ancestor's tomb and civilization were destroyed. Don't you feel ashamed? Even I feel ashamed of you! If you assist Zhao, it would benefit both of us. This is a good opportunity for you to take revenge. Don't you want to redeem your reputation and dignity?\\" Then he continued: \\"Now that we are here, we can put up a united front against Qin. It is for Chu rather than for Zhao, but you are so tardy in stating your position. What right do you have to yell at me in front of my master?\\" Mao Sui's words made the king feel very embarrassed, but at the same time it aroused within him the will to fight. Thus, he, Prince Ping Yuan and Mao Sui licked the blood of animal (usually chicken) and swore (This was a tradition of oath in ancient China, the idea was that putting blood on the mouth solemnified the words of the treaty of alliance, and signified the punishment that would come on whoever broke the agreement) Three months later, the allied forces of Zhao and the Chu defeated Qin's army and saved Han Dan. After Prince Ping Yuan returned to Zhao, he treated Mao Sui as the most honorable guest. He said with a deep sigh: \\"This time King of the Chu will never look down upon Zhao just because of Mao Sui.\\"  Later life  There are very few records about Mao Sui except 'Mao Sui zi jian', but this story is very famous in China. There are very few records about him after 'Mao Sui zi jian' in the gazetteer, Jize Xian Zhi. Although he was conferred the title of imperial adviser after 'Mao Sui zi jian', but due to jealousy from other officers, king of Zhao also did not adopt Mao Sui's admonishments anymore. Mao Sui felt he was underrated by the king. So he resigned and returned to his hometown. Having reached his hometown, he stayed for 20 years and lived with the village folk. In 230 BC, there was a drought in Jize, in which all the crops withered. People from other villages had to leave their hometowns and beg for a living. At this time, Mao Sui spent all his savings to help his folks, so that they could get over this famine. In return, they all appreciated Mao Sui's generosity. Mao Sui park The only one named as such, Mao Sui park is located in the Jize county of Hebei province. In order to popularize the spirit and culture of Mao Sui, this park perfectly combines historical culture with modern humanistic spirit and natural ecology. Mao Sui park was built in 2009, and it has been improved upon over the years. The park comprises 8 hectares of lakes, 6 hectares of hills, 19 hectares of greenery, landscaping and cultural facilities. The total area is 33 hectares. It has truly integrated the lake, forests, mountains and culture seamlessly. In terms of structure, the park is divided into one lake, one mountain, three islands, eight scenic spots and nine districts, and is incorporated with eight historical and cultural landscapes. At the same time, the park also includes recreation, viewing and water sports, all of which render it a good venue for leisure and entertainment for the surrounding residents. Mao Sui was born in Jize county, and here it is a household name. The statue of Mao Sui on the square occupies the center of the park, and serves to highlight the profound contribution of 'Mao Sui'. Therefore, the park has been named as 'Mao Sui Park'. It also reflects the pride of local people. The park has nine functional areas, such as the square area, the plants area and so on, which serve as viable open spaces for people to enjoy fitness and leisure. During the Spring Festival of 2016 when various cultural events were held, Mao Sui Park created a new record of the number of tourists, having received more than 30,000 visitors per day and ranking first in the list of the province's 4A-level parks. During the Spring Festival of 2017, number of tourists visiting Mao Sui Park once again established a new record. Total number of visitors reached more than 160,000 people, and the daily flow was pegged at more than 50,000 people. Mao Sui Statue Mao Sui statue was completed in 2012 and is located in Mao Sui theme park. Currently, it is the largest single statue in China and is made of red sandstone. It depicts that Mao Sui held a long sword in his left hand. Stretching to a height of 11.09 meters, it weighs 142 tons. This statue has been designed by Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The sculpture also reflects the iconic viewpoint of Mao Sui theme park. Film To promote and instill the spirit of 'Mao Sui', Propaganda Department of Hebei Provincial Party Committee, Hebei film and TV Production Center and Propaganda Department of Jize county joined hands in cooperation to make the film titled legend of Mao Sui (). This film reinterprets the story of 'MAO SUI ZI JIAN' that took place 2200 years ago, and highlights the contribution of Mao Sui as also his outstanding character. The film was based in the Warring States era, and focused on the famous Hebei persuader Mao Sui. When the Qin State besieged Zhao State, Mao Sui volunteered to go to the Chu State with Prince Ping Yuan of Zhao Sheng. Mao Sui persuaded the king of Chu to send troops to save Zhao State which was in danger. The film revolves around the legend of Mao Sui because of his courage and bravery. This film was released in China in 2013 and will be released overseas by HuaXia Film Distribution Co., Ltd. Idiom  This historical story also finds a place in form of a famous idiom in China, ÊØõÈÅÇËá™Ëñ¶ 'M√°o Su√¨ z√¨ ji√†n' which means to volunteer for a task or to recommend oneself. This idiom is usually used as a compliment. Mao Sui was a brave person and his self-recommendation is representative of his brave character. It serves as a metaphor for someone that must be brave enough and responsible enough to deal with things.  Tomb  There are two records pertaining to Mao Sui's grave. The first record in the Yong Nian Xian Zhi shows that the grave is in the Hebei province, Yong Nian county. The second record shows his grave to be in current Shandong province according to the gazetteerTeng Xian Zhi. The grave in Shandong had been destroyed in the Cultural Revolution. In the spring of 1991, people in Guanqiao town along with the Government rebuilt the tomb, and it was completed in the autumn of the same year. The tomb was dome- shaped. Famous calligrapher Wang Xuezhong's inscription titled \\"Tomb of Mao Sui\\" is placed at the front of the tomb. In 1992, the wall and gate constructions were completed with small bricks and small tiles. In the summer of 1998, a 5-meter high monument was built in front of the tomb.

It supports talented children in the sciences and education to promote social mobility in Russia. The Foundation was established on 10 October 2016. Its mission is to provide additional education opportunities in math, the natural sciences and technology to secondary-school students in the regions where Andrey Melnichenko's companies, fertiliser producer EuroChem and coal energy company SUEK, operate (many are in remote industrial areas of Russia). Melnichenko's companies reportedly spent over $500 million on social and charitable projects in Russia in the last 15 years. The Foundation operates through a network of nine centres it created. It provides state-of-the-art laboratories and technical equipment (tools, computers, video conferencing facilities for remote teaching). Three centers are partnerships with local municipalities and six are based at major technical universities in the regions. The Foundation funds classroom and laboratory space, management and teaching staff salaries and equipment. At these centres, it runs formal after-school programmes with classes in math, chemistry, biology, astronomy, physics and robotics. Students spend an average of 14 hours per week at its centres. The students range in age from 11 to 17 (5th through 11th grades) and come primarily come from lower- and middle-income families. Participation in the programmes is free of charge. In 2019, there are nearly 2,700 students attending the Foundation's centres. The Foundation's programmes exist in over thirty Russian regions.  Activity  The Foundation created a network of educational centres for schoolchildren in the cities where EuroChem and SUEK have a presence. There, children undertake in-depth study of mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering and technical creativity, programming, robotics, as well as astronomy and Earth sciences. According to media reports, since October 2019, the Foundation opened nine Centres of Children's Creativity in Science and Engineering (in cities and towns in Kemerovo region, Altai territory, Stavropol region, Tula region).

It is now in the Yorkshire Museum. Discovery and date The fossil was discovered in Whitby in 1995 by Alan Gurr whilst on a field trip to the site led by geologist Phil Manning. A chunk of sandstone fell from cliff face and was inspected by the finder, who spotted the fragment of vertebra. As it is not identifiable to species level, it gained the nickname 'Alan' in commemoration of its finder. It was located in the Saltwick Formation, a Mesozoic formation. Manning recovered the fossil from the base of a coastal cliff section, some 600 m east of Whitby East Pier. Although the source horizon was not definitively located, based on the relative position of the vertebra in the cliff, resting on top of the Dogger Formation, the fossil came from the Aalenian period of the Middle Jurassic and dates to 175.6 ¬± 2.0-171.6 ¬± 3.0 million years ago. This date makes the fossil the earliest evidence of a eusauropod dinosaur from the United Kingdom. Description The fossil is a proximal caudal vertebra encased within sandstone and measuring 145 mm in length.

(BRO) was a professional bull riding organization based in Englewood, Colorado, United States. History Inspired by years of successful unsanctioned stand-alone bull-riding events, businessman and former bull rider, Shaw P. Sullivan and investment banker Erick Dickson created the first organization dedicated exclusively to bull riding in the United States, Bull Riders Only, Inc. (BRO). They founded the organization in 1991, with the first season happening that year. BRO did not charge its riders entrance fees, unlike the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). The organization held its first event in June 1991; despite grossing only $40,000, the other four events that year were successful enough that they held 11 events in the second season, with total prizes of $20,000. The organization instituted what is now known as the sudden-death format in bull riding, where the contestants compete in rounds until a winner is established. BRO's first such event had 30 contestants; the top 18 proceeded to the next round, and then the top 10 competed for the cash prizes. BRO attracted many of the top PRCA bull riders from the 1990s such as Charlie Sampson, Tuff Hedeman, Cody Lambert, Ted Nuce, Jim Sharp, Scott Mendes, Ty Murray, and Adriano Moraes. Every year, BRO would expand the number of events it had, with the season concluding with a world finals event. Since its first season, BRO events were televised on the Prime Network, ESPN and Fox Sports Networks. The inaugural BRO world finals event for the 1991 season took place in Long Beach, California. The 1992 BRO world finals took place in Denver, Colorado. The 1993 world finals took place once again in Long Beach, California. The 1994 and 1995 world finals events took place again in Denver, Colorado. The 1996 world finals took place in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1992, after the Justin Boots World Bull Riding Championship in Scottsdale, Arizona, about a dozen of the best bull riders in the PRCA planned to create their own bull-riding tour, in much the same way as the BRO organization had done a few years earlier. Many bull riders who competed in BRO were unhappy with the terms of their contracts, such as Sullvan's insistence on choosing which sponsorship logos riders could wear, how prize money would be disbursed, and which bulls each rider would get on; they felt they should have control of these matters, instead. Tuff Hedeman recalled, \\"We basically said, 'Screw you.'\\" The number of original investors grew to 21 and included PRCA and BRO bull riders. They formed the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) as its own separate tour as a way for them to decide how the bull-riding competition was run. Michael Gaffney, one of the founders of the PBR, described how tough it was to make ends meet when he was bull riding in the PRCA. He said that when BRO came along, it paid more, but he described Sullivan as a dictator. At one meeting in Denver, many veteran riders walked out after Sullivan tried to get some of the most notable riders to sign exclusivity rights. Riders such as Hedeman, Lambert, and Cody Custer were in this group, which Sullivan needed to attract enough fans. For younger riders like himself, Gaffney related that Sullivan used \\"ploy and scare tactics\\" to sign that contract. Sullivan had tried to get Hedeman and Lambert into events, but left out Custer out because, according to Gaffney, \\"he didn't like him.\\" Eventually, all of the riders gave Sullivan an ultimatum: include Custer or none of them would compete. By the 1997-1998 season, BRO was struggling financially as a result of the previous season‚Äôs world finals being the most expensive event the organization had ever produced, and also because the bull riding market in the United States at the time could not support two professional tours. At the end of the season, BRO went out of business. David Fournier, from Raceland, Louisiana, is one of the founders of the PBR, a seven-time NFR qualifier and four-time qualifier for the PBR World Finals. He lays the blame for the failure of BRO squarely on the shoulders of its founder, Shaw Sullivan. According to Fournier, Sullivan was resolute that riders attempt three bulls a night, but after two, they \\"didn't have anything left\\", yet they were paired with Bodacious-like eliminator matchups. He said, \\"Had BRO taken care of the business end of it and let the bull riders control the bull-riding part of it, I think it would be what the PBR is today.\\" Organization The BRO headquarters were established in Englewood, Colorado. After BRO started up, most of the bull riders continued to compete in both BRO and the PRCA. Once the PBR had also been founded in 1992, its headquarters were in nearby Colorado Springs, Colorado. The PBR had its first competitive season in 1994, in which they held eight events and disbursed $250,000 in prize money. Like the PRCA, the PBR hosted its world championships in Las Vegas, Nevada. However, unlike the PRCA‚Äôs National Finals Rodeo, which was held at the Thomas and Mack Center, the PBR‚Äôs finals event was held in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The PBR had quite successful sponsorship, allowing it to compete with BRO. In 1995, the PBR expanded to 12 major league events, plus a series of several minor league events. They hired Randy Bernard to serve as CEO. By 1997, both BRO and the PBR were holding approximately two dozen events each. However, PBR paid out more money for all of its regular season events than BRO did for its one and two-day events. By the end of its 1997-98 season, BRO went out of business. This business with these two organizations and their tours also had an effect on the PRCA; the bull riding in that organization was greatly diminished. Bull riders in the PRCA reduced their riding to just enough to try to make the lucrative National Finals Rodeo. On the other hand, the PBR tour, requiring its top riders to compete in all of its major league events, was considered a better choice financially and physically. In October 1993, at the Rosemont Horizon in, 30 bull riders from BRO, including Dan Wolfe, came to demonstrate their skills at the Acme Bull Riders Only Main Event. \\"It's like a 100 percent adrenaline rush,\\" says Wolfe, 22. \\"The bull acts, and you react. It's kind of like a dance.\\" A lot of preparation took place for the Rosemont Horizon to handle a bull-riding event. Dirt, equipment, and bulls came from distances all around. However, one of the event's backers, Stedman Graham, was not pleased with the turnout, but he did recognize that market needed to be developed. The year 1993 was the third time that Sullivan held the Acme Bull Riders Only Main Event, but it was the first for Chicago. For the Bull Riders Only tour that year, the Rosemont Horizon was the 12th event of a 13 city tour. The championship round is held in Long Beach in November and by that time $250,000 in prize money would have been disbursed. One of the biggest participants and contributors to both the PRCA and BRO was bull riding champion and hall-of-famer Tuff Hedeman. He holds three world championships in the PRCA, one in 1993 in BRO, and one in 1995 in the PBR. He was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame and the Bull Riding Hall of Fame, among many others. Hall-of-Famer and 8-time PRCA world champion bull rider Don Gay said that, \\"Without Tuff, there would be no stand-alone bull-riding events other than Bull Riders Only (BRO). Without Tuff, the PBR would never have happened.\\" In August 1993, the Bull Riders Only tour stopped in the Delta Center. To date that year, Hedeman was first in the world standings, with $20,275 earned. Jim Sharp was in second place with $14,000 in earnings. In 1993, BRO paid out a total $286,000 in prize money. The championship finished on November 20 in Long Beach, California, paying out $50,000. Bull rider Richard Rule spent over 15 years traveling the country to ride bulls in the PRCA and BRO. He ranked in the top 25 riders persistently and was highly regarded by his fellow competitors. His top accomplishment was capturing the Mountain States Circuit Bull Riding Championship in 1985. Terry Don West Terry Don West is best known for riding the infamous bull Bodacious. He also has five world champion bull rider titles between the PRCA, IPRA and BRO. West had attempted Bodacious four times and gotten a qualified ride twice. The 1996 BRO World Championships were held April 3-5, 1997 at the Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Despite some injuries, Terry Don West was intent on riding a bull named Woolly Bully on finals night. Not only did West manage to ride the bull for 8 seconds, but he turned in a 91 point score. \\"This, tonight, is a dream come true,\\" West said of that night's ride which won him the 1996 Bull Riders Only world championship title. Bull rider Shane Thurston came in second place with an 84 on the bull Nitro. Thurston and West made the only qualified rides in the championship round. West was reported as saying he would ride the infamous bull Bodacious in a sponsored match for the Bull Riders Only Championship in April 1997. The plan at that point was to bring the bull out of retirement to face West or another cowboy if West was not signed up by BRO officials in time for the week of October 3-5. The event was planned to take place in Las Vegas. Retired in 1995, BRO planned a big event to bring him out of retirement in 1996 and have a special matchup with a bull rider. Although the bull was retired due to injuries he was causing riders, many want to see him buck again for another ride. It was planned to have him buck at the BRO World Championship in Las Vegas. The then rider in the works to match up with him was Terry Don West, who just won the PRCA bull riding champion title. \\"I don't think anyone craves getting on that bull,\\" said West recently. \\"But if the money's right, that would be the reason I would want to get on him. We're in negotiations, and I'm sure there are other guys wanting a shot at him, too. But I think the fans out there would love to see me matched up with him.\\" The president of BRO, Shaw Sullivan, assured everyone that Bodacious would not be put into a draw. \\"It'll be a match,\\" Sullivan said. \\"With West matched against him, it would be the rankest bull in the world and the rankest bull rider.\\" The event was planned to be held at the Thomas and Mack Arena. It was to be broadcast by the Fox Television Network to 100 million homes. Tuff Hedeman's best ride on Bodacious In 1993, Tuff Hedeman participated in the 1993 BRO World Finals, in Long Beach, California. He remained resolute in his determination to get a qualified ride on Bodacious. \\"He was like a monster once he matured. Even the good guys were super scared of him. You‚Äôd see world champions ride him for a jump or two and then get off.\\" This time, Hedeman scored 95 points on Bodacious in his third attempt on him. Hedeman felt this ride was the best in his career. He explained \\"the judges told me they wished I hadn't been the first guy out. They were saving some room, on the chance that there would possibly be a better ride. But when it was over they said they'd have marked me higher if I'd ridden last. Sammy Andrews, who owned Bodacious, said he'd have marked me 98 or 99, and that it was the best ride he'd ever seen\\". There are those who consider it the greatest ride in history, \\"a near perfect exhibition of balance and anticipation.\\" The ride was good enough for Hedeman to win enough money to win the BRO world championship that year. End of Bodacious‚Äô career Bodacious was to be brought out of retirement one final time in the spring of 1997. On Saturday, April 5, 1997, Terry Don West planned to take on Bodacious for a fifth and final time in an attempt to break their 2-2 tie. Fox Television talked West into it, with the $10,000 purse being donated to Sunrise Children's Hospital. This event was to cap off the $1 million Wrangler Bull Riders Only (BRO) 1996 World Championships at the Thomas & Mack Center. \\"I hope this is the last time they buck that bull. He will kill somebody,\\" said West, who was the reigning PRCA World Bull Riding Champion at the time. West nervously climbed into Bodacious' pen for a photography session at Harrah's. The bull was accompanied by a familiar cow and two calves to keep him calm. \\"He'll tear the pen up,\\" West said. \\"When I got in there, he gave me a look, saying 'Don't get no closer. You'll pay for it.'\\" West, then 31 years old, was slated to wear a chest vest and a face mask. He also pre-purchased additional insurance. \\"Bo hasn't forgotten how to buck,\\" said West. However, two nights before the match scheduled with Bodacious, West had a match with a bull named Bananarama. Bananarama fell back against the chute while West was getting ready, pinning West and resulting in two black eyes, a broken ankle, and a concussion. West was not able to compete the following night nor to take on Bodacious by Saturday night at their scheduled time. Thus, West's fifth ride with Bodacious never took place. Fox nevertheless donated the money to the children's hospital. This meant that Bo's retirement stayed in effect, and at that time, it was well along the second year. Also notable regarding Bodacious' career and BRO is that Bodacious was the 1995 BRO Bull of the Year. Bodacious was profiled on BRO telecasts on the Cowboy Lifestyle Network.

While there, he met a group of engineers from Scotland who were working on a Russian government contract, and they persuaded him to emigrate to Glasgow. Sclare arrived in 1889, and soon found work as a marine engineer. He joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and soon served as secretary and then president of his branch. Due to his socialist views and trade union activity, in 1906 Sclare was asked to become secretary of the Leeds Jewish Tailors', Machinists' and Pressers' Union. The previous secretary, Sam Freedman, had been sacked for stealing union funds, and the union was short of money. Within his first year, Sclare almost doubled membership to 900. Sclare was elected to the executive of Leeds Trades Council, and as the union expanded, it offered many new facilities to members, including a Labour Hall, kosher food, burial, and prayer facilities. In both 1907 and 1908, he led strikes against piecework, both proving partially successful. A further strike in 1911 led to arbitration which improved the pay and conditions of the union's members, and membership had reached 4,500 by 1915. However, Sclare's ambition to open branches of the union in other cities proved unsuccessful. Instead, in 1915 he took it into a merger which formed the United Garment Workers' Trade Union (UTGWU). Sclare was a member of Poale Zion, and his motions in support of political and civil rights for Jewish people were passed by the Trades Union Congress in 1915 and 1916. He chaired the Leeds branch of the Workers' League for Jewish Emancipation. Sclare became the financial secretary of the UTGWU, and remained a leading figure after it merged into the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers.

As a two-year-old in 2016 she won the JRA Award for Best Two-Year- Old Filly after winning all three of her races including the Grade 1 Hanshin Juvenile Fillies. In the following year she took the Tulip Sho and ran third in the Oka Sho before taking the Yushun Himba and was again rated the best of her age and sex in Japan, winning the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Filly. She remained in training for two more seasons but failed to win again. Background Soul Stirring is a brown mare with a white blaze and a white sock on her left hind leg bred in Hokkaido by the Yoshida family's Shadai Group. She was sent into training with Kazuo Fujisawa. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Frankel, an undefeated racehorse whose other progeny have included Cracksman and Without Parole. Soul Stirring was the second foal of Stacelita, a multiple Group 1 winner in both Europe and the United States. As a descendant of the German mare Schonbrunn (foaled 1966) she was closely related to many other major winners including Sagace, Zagreb and Steinlen. Racing career 2016: two-year-old season Soul Stirring began her racing career by winning a race for newcomers over 1800 metres at Sapporo Racecourse on 31 July 2016. On 22 October the filly returned for the Ivy Stakes at Tokyo Racecourse and won from Persian Knight, a colt who went on to win the Mile Championship. The filly was then stepped up to Group 1 class for the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies over 1600 metres at Hanshin Racecourse in which she was ridden by Christophe Lemaire started the 1.8/1 favourite against eighteen opponents. Soul Stirring tracked the leaders before going to the front in the straight and won by one and a quarter lengths from the Artemis Stakes winner Lys Gracieux. Lemaire commented \\"I‚Äôm ecstatic. It's so special because I used to also ride her dam Stacelita... I was confident from the beginning and we were in a good position and she was relaxed. She easily hit the front at the stretch and with her big strides and stamina; I think she can go a little bit further in distance\\". Soul Stirring won the JRA Award for Best Two-Year-Old Filly, taking 290 of the 291 votes. 2017: three-year-old season Soul Stirring began her second season in the Tulip Sho at Hanshin on 4 March when she started odds-on favourite and won by two lengths from the 52/1 outsider Miss Panthere with Lys Gracieux in third. On 9 April, Soul Stirring was made 2/5 favourite for the Grade 1 Oka Sho over the same course and distance. Racing on soft ground she raced in mid division, but despite making progress in the straight she was beaten into third place behind Reine Minoru and Lys Gracieux. Lemaire explained \\"The track condition was against her and she kept changing leads. She wasn‚Äôt able to show her true form in this race\\". In the Yushun Himba over 2400 metre at Tokyo Soul Stirring was partnered by Lemaire and started the 1.4/1 favourite in an 18-runner field which included Lys Gracieux, Reine Minoru, Admire Miyabi (Queen Cup), Mozu Katchan (Flora Stakes) and Deirdre. Soul Stirring raced just behind the leaders along the inside rail before switching to the right to make her challenge in the straight. She gained the advantage in the straight and won comfortably by one and three quarter lengths from Mozu Katchan. After the race Lemaire said \\"Soul Stirring certainly has inherited the power both from her sire (Frankel) and her dam. I was quite confident coming into this race. I wasn't sure yet about the distance as it was her first time (at 2,400m) so I wanted her in a good position which I did because she is quick out of the gate. She also has a good lasting speed so I was able to give her the go from early at the stretch and sustain our bid right up to the finish\\". After a summer break Soul Stirring returned in autumn for three races in which she was matched against older hores and male opposition. In October she ran eighth behind Real Steel when favourite for the Mainichi Okan and then came home sixth to Kitasan Black in the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho. On her final run of the season Soul Stirring came home seventh of the seventeen runners behind Cheval Grand in the Japan Cup at Tokyo on 26 November. In January 2018, Soul Stirring won the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Filly, beating Mozu Katchan by 162 votes to 120. 2018 & 2019: four- and five-year-old seasons Soul Stirring remained in training as a four-year-old in 2018. She began her campaign by running unplaced behind Miss Panthere in the Hanhin Himba Stakes over 1600 metres on 7 April and then came home seventh to Jour Polaire in the Victoria Mile over the same distance at Tokyo on 13 May. The Queen Stakes over 1800 metres at Sapporo on 29 July saw Soul Stirring earn her first prize money of the year as she finished third to Deirdre and Frontier Queen. She returned after the summer break for the Fuchu Himba at Tokyo on 13 October but ran poorly and finished tenth of the thirteen runners behind Deirdre. On her first and only run as a five-year-old Soul Stirring ran unplaced behind Normcore in the Victoria Mile on 12 May.

Kansas voters chose nine electors, or representatives to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice-President. Background Kansas had been a powerfully Republican state during the 1920s (as it had been during its first quarter-century of statehood), although it did not possess the isolationist sentiment found in Appalachia or the Upper Midwest.Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 420-426 In 1928 large-scale anti-Catholic voting swept a state substantially part of the Ozark ‚ÄúBible Belt‚Äù, so that whereas Kansas had been less anti-Democratic than more northerly Plains states in 1920 and 1924, it became Herbert Hoover‚Äôs best state in the entire nation at the next election cycle. However, Hoover‚Äôs first term saw disaster on two fronts for the Great Plains: the economic calamity of the Great Depression was combined with a major drought in the region from 1930 onwards. Consequently, agricultural states like Kansas, which had already been hit by declining prices during the 1920s, were severely affected by a wave of foreclosures and outmigration.Burns, James Macgregor; The Crosswinds of Freedom, 1932-1988; Roosevelt, despite the strong Republican bent of the state, saw a major opportunity in the Plains States, visiting Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota extensively during his campaign in September.Grant, Phillip A.; ‚ÄòEstablishing a Two-Party System: The 1932 Presidential Election in South Dakota‚Äô; Presidential Studies Quarterly, volume 10, no. 1: ‚ÄúPoliticizing the Presidency‚Äù, 1789-1980 (Winter, 1980), pp. 73-77 Outside of the prosperous Northeast,Phillips; The Emerging Republican Majority, p. 44 Hoover‚Äôs attempts at apologetics were a complete failure,Carcasson, Martin; ‚ÄòHerbert Hoover and the Presidential Campaign of 1932: The Failure of Apologia‚Äô, Presidential Studies Quarterly, volume 28, No. 2, ‚ÄúThe Buck Stops Here: Decision Making in the Oval‚Äù (Spring, 1998), pp. 349-365 with the result that Roosevelt carried every state west of the Appalachians.

Finney, 437 U.S. 678 (1978), was a landmark Supreme Court case against the Arkansas Department of Correction. The litigation lasted almost a decade, from 1969 through 1978. It was the first successful lawsuit filed by an inmate against a correctional institution. The case also clarified Arkansas penitentiary system prison's unacceptable punitive measures. Hutto v. Finney was a certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit..  Background  In their 1998 book Policy Making and the Modern State: How the Courts Reformed America, Malcolm M. Feeley and Edward L. Rubin traced the history of prison reform in Arkansas to 1965 and the case of Talley v. StephensThe superintendent at Cummins was Dan D. Stephens. 247 F. Supp. 683 (1965), a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas on behalf of prisoners at Cummins prison, located along the Arkansas River, 75 miles southeast of Little Rock, in Lincoln County, Arkansas. The presiding judge was Judge J. Smith Henley, who was familiar with \\"the long series of scandals involving the Arkansas prison system\\". Feeley and Rubin described Cummins prison farm in the mid-1960s, \\"on the eve of events that were to transform it and initiate the judicial prison reform process\\" where \\"trusty guards\\", \\"reliable\\" armed prisoners‚àíhardened felons themselves‚àíon foot and on horseback, supervised long lines of prisoners who were working in the vast fields \\"six days a week, ten hours a day\\". Prisoners also worked as house servants in the plantation homes of Cummins officers. Concerned about a \\"federal court takeover\\" similar to the federal response after then-Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard to Little Rock Central High School on September 4, 1957 to prevent desegregation, Arkansas' prison officials improved some of the conditions for prisoners. On February 18, 1970, Judge J. Smith Henley wrote that, \\"For the ordinary convict a sentence to the Arkansas Penitentiary.. .amounts to a banishment from civilized society to a dark and evil world completely alien to the free world, a world that is administered by criminals under unwritten rules and customs completely foreign to free world culture.\\" According to a 1971 article published in The University of Chicago Law Review, in Holt v. Sarver (1969) (), Judge J. Smith Henley ruled that the \\"entire Arkansas penitentiary system prison, as then operated, constituted cruel and unusual punishment\\" and that some aspects of the system were unconstitutional and ordered administrators to implement changes and report on progress towards implementation. According to an October 1978 article in the American Bar Association Journal, the ten-year long litigation against the Arkansas Department of Correction in Supreme Court Hutto v. Finney 437 U.S. 678 (1978) began in 1969. SCOTUS determined that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited the practice of using punitive isolation for more than 30 days. Defense attorneys for the prisoners, Philip E. Kaplan and Jack Holt Jr., began their work in December 1969 with the first litigation challenging conditions in the Arkansas prison system. This case involved a challenge to the practice of \\"punitive isolation\\" in Arkansas prisons which was often done for indiscriminate periods of time in crowded windowless cells. Kaplan and Holt Jr. also defended the prisoners in Holt v. Sarver. In his 2007 paper published in the University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law, professor Seth F. Kreimer traced the history of court decisions prior to Hutto v. Finney, in relation to what constitutes \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" in prison systems, in terms of violating the Eighth Amendment. Jackson v. Bishop 404 F.2d 571 (8th Cir. 1968), in which then-judge Harry Blackmun abolished corporal punishment in Arkansas' penitentiary system, \\"constituted a leading precedent in the application of the recently- incorporated Eighth Amendment to prison practices.\\"  Procedural history  Hutto v. Finney (1978) was the first successful lawsuit filed by an inmate against a correctional institution. The case also clarified the Arkansas' prison system's unacceptable punitive measures. During the trial, the prisoners' living conditions were scrutinized. By June 23, 1978, as part of the Finney v Hutto series, there \\"had been three published district court opinions, five additional unpublished interim memoranda and orders of the district court, and three opinions in the appeals court regarding the Arkansas Department of Correction and the administration of the Arkansas prison system. All of the findings of unconstitutionality of the Arkansas prison system as cruel and unusual punishment by the district court had either been affirmed or never challenged\\". Amicus briefs The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and others filed amicus briefs \\"urging affirmance\\" in support of the Respondent. Over a dozen attorneys general and assistant attorneys general, from across the country filed briefs for the Petitioner. Counsel of Record Garner L. Taylor, Jr., Assistant Attorney General of Arkansas, was the Chief Lawyer for the Petitioners with then-Arkansas Attorney General, Bill Clinton, and Robert Alston Newcomb also on the brief. The Chief Lawyer for the Respondents was Philip E. Kaplan, with Jack Holt, Jr., and seven other attorneys. Decision The Supreme Court handed down its decision in Hutto v. Finney on June 23, 1978. They called for a limit on the amount of time prisoners spent in solitary confinement. The Court fined the Department of Correction $20,000 because of the reluctance of prison officials to remedy the unconstitutional prison conditions in Arkansas. Culture In 2011, the Old State House Museum hosted an award-winning exhibition, co-curated by Brian Robertson, Tony Perrin, and Bobby Roberts, entitled, Badges, Bandits & Bars: Arkansas Law and Justice exploring Arkansas' \\"history of crime and punishment from pre-territorial days to the mid-1980s\\". \\"Behind Bars\\" dealt with \\"Arizona's seemingly endless quest to reform its prison system\\".

The 1st Army Corps (since 1961 Field Army Corps 1) existed from 1891 to 2003. In 1891, the Swiss army was first divided into four army corps. Paul C√©r√©sole, a member of the Federal Council from 1870 to 1875 and father of the pacifist Pierre C√©r√©sole, was in 1891 given command of the 1st Army Corps, which he commanded until 1898. In 1917, the army was divided into six divisions, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of which were included in the 1st Army Corps. Outline of the 6 Divisions of the Swiss Army, \\"Ordre de Bataille\\" of 1917  World War II  After war mobilization in World War II of 2 September 1939, the 3rd Division became the army reserve in the area Laupen - Aarberg - Ins - Murten to prepare the barrier between Neuch√¢tel and Lake Biel (Operation Order No. 1). The Murten area was upgraded as a cornerstone of the advanced position with additional reinforcements and operated by the Border Brigade 2 and the Light Brigade 1. Shortly before the outbreak of war, the border troops (troop order 1938) were reorganized with 11 border brigades (Gz Br). During the entire Second World War, the border brigades remained in their home region, the mission area and subordination were often adapted. The 1st Army Corps had the border brigades 1-3.  Cold War  Dispositions of Field Army Corps 1 are shown in the west of Switzerland in this 1992 map In 1945, the 1st Army Corps was reinforced with the Light Brigade 1, the Mountain Infantry Regiments (rgt inf mont) 5, 6, 7, the Mountain Fusilier Battalion (Geb F√ºs Bat) 17, and the 3rd Division became the 3rd Mountain Division. In 1947 a Panzerj√§gerabteilung reinforced the corps. The headquarters was in Berne until the end of World War II and was relocated to Lausanne in 1955. During the Cold War, Engine Infantry Regiment 2 of Mechanized Division 1 was scheduled to occupy the infantry barrier between its two tank regiments. In 1961, due to the Army 61 structure plan changes, the following changes were made: The 1st Division became the Mechanized Division (Divm√©c) 1, the 2nd Divisional Division (Div fr) 2, and the 3rd Division was converted into the Field Division 3. Then came the Border Brigade 3 (br fr 3) and the territorial brigade (br ter) 1. The fortress Saint-Maurice became the Fortress Brigade 10 and was transferred to Mountain Army Corps 3. Due to the basic disposition Zeus of 1992 the FAK 1 comprised the Mechanized Division 1, the Field Divisions 2 and 3, Border Brigades 1-3, and, as corps troops, Cyclist Regiment 4 and Genieregiment 5 (Engineer Regiment 5). The Army 95 reforms led to the dissolution of Border Brigades 1, 2, and 3, Mechanized Division 1, and fortifications. With the new Army XXI plan all army corps and divisions were dissolved at the end of 2003.NZZ of 3 November 2003: farewell from field army corps 4  Corps Room and Attack Axes  The Swiss Army has due to the Hague Convention the duty to defend their territory from the country's borders according to the principle of Armed Neutrality. Admin.ch: Agreement on rights and obligations of the neutral powers and persons in the event of a land war. Completed in The Hague on October 18, 1907] The zone of responsibility of FAK 1 was with about 8000 square kilometers, the largest of all field army corps spaces and included the cantons Geneva, Vaud, Neuch√¢tel, Freiburg, Berne and Law. It was bilingual and was mainly in the Western Switzerland and consisted of the three sections of the Northern Jura (barri√®re du Jura), middle part (about 70 km wide) of the Mittellands and the Prealps in the south. It ranged from Geneva to Kleinl√ºtzel, from Lake Geneva to Emme and the Vaud, Friborg and Bernese foothills.

After the war against Negan and the Saviors, he married Nabila and several years after Rick Grimes' assumed death, they conceived three children. Much like Daryl Dixon, Simon and Sasha Williams, Jerry is an original character that does not have a counterpart in the comic book series of the same name. Appearances Season 7 Jerry first appeared in the episode \\"The Well\\" where he was seen in the auditorium with King Ezekiel and Shiva. Jerry also accompanies Ezekiel and the others as they gather feral pigs in the city to give to the Saviors. In \\"Rock in the Road\\", Jerry appeared next to King Ezekiel when he was refusing a deal with Rick Grimes about the rebellion against the Saviors. In \\"New Best Friends\\", during an offering for the Saviors, things got tense when Richard and Jared, a hostile Savior, started to argue. Because of this, Jerry and the others aim their weapons towards the Saviors, although nonetheless, the confrontation was stopped by the leaders of both groups. Before returning to their community, the group visited Carol at her new home and Jerry took the time to give her a fruit cake. In \\"Bury Me Here\\", a week after their meeting, the same team ventured to give the Saviors again an offering of twelve melons but before the meeting they had crossed a various, strangely put obstacles that prevented their passage to the meeting. When the group arrived to the meeting, the Saviors were surprised that one of the melons were missing in the box, Gavin orders to Jared to execute a member of their group as a punishment. Jerry witnessed as Benjamin was injured in the leg by Jared and in an act of despair for helping the boy, he ended up dying of blood loss. Finding the last missing melon, Jerry and the group met again with the Saviors to deliver what was missing and with horror he watched as the cause of Benjamin's death was Richard, who was killed by Morgan with his own hands. In \\"The First Day of the Rest of Your Life\\", Jerry prepares with Carol, Morgan and King Ezekiel to help Rick in the war against the Saviors and save Carl from certain death at the hands of Negan with the help of Shiva along with the Hilltop.

In \\"How It's Gotta Be\\", after saving Rick from being killed by the Saviors when inspecting the remains of the Sanctuary, Jerry separates himself from the group back to the Kingdom and helps his friends in a possible battle but on the way he was ambushed and captured by the Simon and his group of Saviors who beat him until he was seriously injured. In addition, after the Saviors intercepted Maggie's and her group's trip to the Sanctuary, clarifying that one of them should be killed as punishment for the attacks they had been made, Gary was about to execute Jerry but Simon ordered him not to do so and instead ended the life of one of Maggie's soldiers. In \\"Dead or Alive Or\\", Jerry energetically helped prepare the place for an impending attack by the Saviors and accompanied Maggie to the makeshift prison where all the captive Saviors were to make it clear that they were going to decrease their food ration due to all the people who now took refuge in the community but later she decided with a change of heart that the Saviors will leave for a few minutes a day in pairs and under the close supervision of the guards.

On the way to Washington D.C., Jerry is seen patrolling and guarding the perimeter of the routes. When Rick and his group arrived at the Sanctuary to deliver the materials the Saviors, they discovered a message on the wall that highlighted that some were still with Negan, Jerry assured Daryl to ignore the person who had done it; and after the visit, he accompanied Ezekiel on his trip to the Kingdom, promising Carol to take care of him during her absence. In \\"The Bridge\\", Jerry was one of the people who served in the construction of the bridge that would allow trade between all the communities and temporarily settled in the small camp they had established as a base of operations with his loving interest. When a herd of walkers approached to the construction zone putting everyone's life at risk, Jerry was one of those responsible for activating the alarms to divert the walkers away from the group. In \\"Warning Signs\\", Jerry watches the group as the Saviors begin to blame Daryl and Anne for being the murderers of Justin, a member of their group. They grab axes in order for retaliation, but it was stopped by Rick with his gun warning everyone to back off.

In \\"Who Are You Now?\\", six years later after Rick's assumed death, Jerry married Nabila and conceived 3 children. When the water and light pipes in the Kingdom were getting worse, Jerry got under way to repair them and in the process while talking with Carol, he joked as the queen of the community and the mother of a prince. However, his pleasant talk was interrupted by the sudden explosion of one of the water pipes, and Jerry next to the king and Carol ran to see what had happened and watched with delight as Henry had come forward to repair the damage caused. In \\"Bounty\\", following the preparations for the fair, Jerry accompanied Ezekiel and a group of Kingdommers that went out to look for more supplies to offer during the event and went into an abandoned theater to get a light bulb to repair the old movie projector. In the process, Jerry managed to find the piece they needed in company with Dianne but accidentally dropped it into a room infested with walkers and along with his companions they risked fighting the walkers to recover it. In \\"Chokepoint\\", when Jerry went for a supply run, he was attacked by a group of plunderers called \\"The Highwaymen\\" (similar to the Saviors) demanding the payment of a toll for all those attending the great community fair, Jerry informed his king what had happened and agreed with his plan to eliminate them to maintain the safety of his community. However, Carol decided to put the situation in her hands and managed to converse with their leader Ozzy and his group in a peaceful way and convince them to protect the roads they took with the Kingdom so in return they can be part of the fair and the communities. Having established an agreement with the Highwaymen, Jerry and his group returned to the Kingdom and getting ready for the fair. In \\"The Calm Before\\", Jerry attended the fair and after hearing an emotional speech from Ezekiel about reuniting the communities, he began to enjoy the event of the fair in the company of Nabila and his three children.

Despite of the risk that the route belonged to the territory of the Whisperers, the Kingdommers managed to arrive safely to the Hilltop Colony. Season 10 In \\"Lines We Cross\\", a few months has passed after the harsh winter, Jerry was part of the militia and they trained on the beach of Oceanside for battle in case that the Whisperers will return, but during the winter the Whisperers had mysteriously disappeared from the area. When a satellite crashed to the Whisperers' territory, the crash caused a forest fire enough to destroy the entire Oceanside. Because of the danger, Jerry and the militia crossed the border that divided them from the Whisperers in order to extinguish the fire. Development and reception Jerry's character entered the recurring cast in the episode \\"The Well\\" of the seventh season. However, Andrews was promoted to a series regular starting the tenth season. Erik Kain of Forbes in the episode \\"Bounty\\" praised the development of Cooper Andrews and wrote: \\"Jerry is wonderful. Cooper Andrews needs to do a movie with Jason Momoa where they're brothers who just chill and crack jokes and drink beer and maybe solve mysteries or save the world or something. I'd watch that movie.\\" Writer for Comicbook Brandon Davis also praised Jerry's development and said: \\"Jerry, played by Cooper Andrews, brought a layer of humor to the AMC series which fan have been unfamiliar with. After all, this is a show which earned its popularity on the mantra of, 'No one is safe.'\\" Nat Berman of TV Overmind also praised the character played by Andrews and wrote: \\"If you are a fan of The Walking Dead, then you know that Cooper Andrews' character, Jerry, is a faithful steward to (the former) King Ezekiel, played by Khary Payton. The character played by Andrews brings a much-needed air of comic relief to a show that can be downright terrifying at times.\\" Dustin Rowles of Uproxx praised Andrews and wrote: \\"The actor who plays The Walking Deads new best character is Cooper Andrews, and if he looks familiar, it's probably because you've seen Halt and Catch Fire, where he plays the similarly delightful Yo-Yo Engberk.\\"  References  Characters created by Robert Kirkman Drama television characters Fictional Samoan people Fictional zombie hunters Male characters in television Television characters introduced in 2016 The Walking Dead characters ","title":"Jerry (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"58789039","text":"Alfred McMurray (4 November 1914 ‚Äì 30 June 1988) was an Irish first-class cricketer.

In the next episode \\"Warning Signs\\", Arat is captured by Cyndie and other survivors from Oceanside, who reveal that Arat was one of the soldiers ordered by Simon to kill the men of their community, and Arat specifically killed Cyndie's 11-year-old brother. Daryl and Maggie find them just as they are about to execute a tearful Arat who insists that she had no choice and has changed. After Arat admits that she told Cyndie \\"no exceptions\\" when Cyndie begged for her brother's life, Maggie and Daryl walk away. Cyndie then impales Arat in the head with a spear, killing her and avenging her brother in the same spot Arat murdered the boy. Development and reception During a Twitter chat with fans, actress Elizabeth Ludlow stated that \\"I think Arat was always an independent woman but losing her family and friends changed her.\\" She also used the words \\"#Survivor\\" \\"#Independent\\" and \\"#Misunderstood\\" to describe the character. In her portrayal of the character, the actress received negative reactions for killing fan-favorite character Olivia: \\"I did receive my fair share of negativity for killing Olivia but it was expected. She was an extremely loved character so I had an expectation of negativity when I read the script for that day. The love I have received and continue to receive heavily outweighs the negativity though so it's easy not to pay attention to that stuff.\\" Arat is killed in the ninth-season episode \\"Warning Signs\\". Entertainment Weekly noted that although Arat had become one \\"of the more cooperative members of the Sanctuary\\", the Oceansiders killed her \\"after Cyndie told them the story of how Arat killed her 11-year-old sibling, of how Arat smiled when she did it and replied to Cyndie's begs with 'no exceptions'\\". Forbes commented that \\"when Cindy explains that Arat killed her mom and her brother---an 11-year-old boy who she killed with a smile and the words \\"No exceptions\\"---Daryl and Maggie turn and walk away. It's a great moment.\\" TV Line commented that \\"Maggie and Daryl turned and walked away, leaving Arat to be murdered while screaming that she'd changed.\\" Uproxx commented that \\"I'm not entirely sure that Maggie chose incorrectly.

It was renamed Minju Chongnyon on the occasion of the Second Congress of the Democratic Youth League of North Korea in September 1946. It got the name Rodong Chongnyon when the Democratic Youth League of Korea was reorganized into the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea in May 1964. The current name, Chongnyon Jonwi was adopted when the youth league became the Kim Il-sung Socialist Youth League in January 1996.

He chose the name Neiriz as artist name after the origin of his family in the Neiriz region of Iran. He has lived in Berlin since 1964.Dance III, 1995 Excavation, 1986 Great Mask, 1988 Metamorphosis I, 1997 Excavation, 1999 Anahita, 2000-2001 Tornado in the studio, 2000 Biography Sadighi Neiriz spent his childhood and youth in Tehran. At the age of 17 Neiriz moved to West Berlin, to take up art studies. He began to study in 1966, initially Architecture at the Berlin University of the Arts (UdK), but after a few semesters he switched to Art Photography, which he was practising continuously in the 1970s. From 1972 onward he studied Art History and Archaeology at the Technical University (TU), Art History and Ethnology at the Free University (FU) ‚Äì in connection with excursions and archaeological excavations. During his studies, Neiriz attended several excavations in the surroundings of the Alban Hills located southeast of Rome. In the course of his studies and in close contact to the Museum of Islamic Art, Neiriz‚Äô later orientation towards Islamic Studies was amplified: ‚ÄúAfter I had experienced a kind of cultural epiphany, I went [1975] to Iran to study archaeology, and to dedicate myself to Persian literature and philosophy\\"1. From summer 1976 to winter 1977 Neiriz attended the lectures of Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr on philosophy of Suhrawardi at the University of Tehran, and of Professor Abdolhossein Zarrinkoob on the Masnavi of Rumi. During that period his main studies were Archaeology with Professor Ezzatollah Negahban, followed by various excavation expeditions in 1977 under Negahban‚Äôs direction in the east of Sefid Rud. After a year, Neiriz returned to Berlin, but soon went back to Esfahan, to do research for his doctoral thesis at the Madrasah Chahar Bagh under the supervision of Professor Honarfar. During a break in one of the traditional tea rooms he discovered an antique nomadic kilim, which brought up associations with compositions of classical modern paintings, and he set out to search for similar pieces. Neiriz started a collection, explored origins, travelled to the nomads and their khans. Gallery Neiriz /Exhibitions For over thirty years, Gallery Neiriz provided the economic foundation in the life of Hamid Sadighi Neiriz. His activities as an art dealer formed a close liaison with the collector. Both these callings were completed by documentary filming and scientific publications on nomadic weavings (with Karin Hawkes), partly in connection with donations to museums and exhibitions. The beginning of Neiriz‚Äôs work as a painter fell into the early days of the gallery, but without public attention. When painting, Neiriz follows his need for expression, which does not go beyond the private sphere, and is located beyond the art market. Neiriz‚Äôs various facets in dealing with art, especially as a dealer and collector, finds its parallel in his own artistic work. The first major exhibition of his paintings took place 2001/02 at the Spandau Citadel.2. The exhibition did not only show paintings (1980‚Äì99) and photographs (1972‚Äì74) of the artist Neiriz, but also works of African Tribal Art.3. In 2014 he presented his works together with a chamber music performance at the Galerie Forum Berlin am Meer. The exhibition closing on 27th of June 2014 marked the farewell of Gallery Neiriz after 34 years. In March 2017 he had a solo exhibition titled ‚ÄúMasks‚Äú at Galerie Madesta in Regensburg.4 Painting In his early paintings (1972-1979)could be mainly figurative-surrealistic tendencies. With time, it moved to a more abstract gestural painting techniques in proximity to Informal Art, Tachism or Abstract Expressionism ‚Äì tendencies formed immediately after World War II, which continue until today.5 They are regarded as a further development of Abstract Art, originating in the 19th century, but are perceived as autonomous movements only at the beginning of Modernism in the 20th century.6 Neiriz‚Äô study of the world art, mostly in direct contact with originals, his own Iranian background, his knowledge of history and religion, and his domicile in the west-east oriented cultural metropolis of Berlin flow into his work. Three groups determine Neiriz‚Äô 2001/2002 exhibition at the Spandau Citadel, differentiated by his series ‚ÄúExcavations‚Äù, ‚ÄúFragments‚Äù and ‚ÄúMasks‚Äù, which stand for the archaic ethno-religious elements of his art. The reappearing title \\"Mask\\"underlines the importance of the mask for Neiriz, especially those of African Tribal Art.7 With his work cycles Neiriz takes up the sensual and spiritual experiences in dealing with ancient art and translates them into his own artistic forms of expression. Photography Photography played a significant role in Neiriz‚Äô early years and was followed by several exhibitions: e.g. at the ‚ÄúGoethe-Institut‚Äú in Tehran in December 1978 during the Iranian Revolution which showcased his social critical photographs taken in Iran before the revolution, one in 1979 at the ‚ÄúDeutsch-Franz√∂sische Gesellschaft‚Äú in Berlin, titled ‚ÄúTableaux Parisiens‚Äú which presented his street and architectural photographs taken in Paris. The Tehran exhibition included colored as well as black and white photographs. Neiriz‚Äô photography exhibitions in Tehran were well attended and soon he was hailed as ‚Äúthe mystic Hamid is a thoughtful artist of the Revolution.8 Dr. Javad Mojabi describes Neiriz as a \\"thinking artist, equipped with an aesthetic eye and intellectual approach to photography. He encourages his audience to explore behind the decorative veneer of his themes, uncovering deeper, innate aspects of objects as metaphors, so that content or conflict becomes visible. His photographs show a wealth of symbolism, often connected to religion and mysticism\\".9 Footnotes Neiriz Kilim Collection Kilims became the main emphasis of Berlin based ‚ÄúGallery Neiriz‚Äù, which was established together with Karin Pregley Hawkes und Robin Hawkes in Berlin on April 1st 1980, with Neiriz‚Äô discoveries from his travels. Soon it advanced to one of the leading galleries of ‚ÄúNon-European Art‚Äù. Although ancient nomadic weaving of the Near East remained the focus, over time African and Oceanic Tribal Art, Islamic and Buddhist Art, archaeological objects from China, Persia, and ancient America, Japanese woodblock prints and Chinese furniture were added. Neiriz' knowledge of kilims is not only based on ethnological studies. The experience that he gained during many travels plays an equally important role. In accompanying nomadic tribes on their migration from winter to summer quarters, he experienced their understanding of nature and the cosmos. In the 1998/99 weavings from the Neiriz Collection were shown in the exhibition ‚ÄúDas Bauhaus webt‚Äù (‚ÄúBauhaus Weaves‚Äù). Here, for the first time nomadic weaves were seen in direct comparison with Bauhaus products. An important inspirer of Bauhaus weaving, Paul Klee (1879‚Äì1940), was also interested in nomadic art and whose ‚Äúfeeling was subject to similar primal fears. Sources 1 - Comp.

She was involved in the women's movement from 1907 and served on the municipal council of N√¶stved from 1909. As a member of the Danish Women's Society, she contributed in particular to children's welfare, later serving as president of the organisation from 1924 to 1931. Representing the Liberal Party, from 1928 until her death in 1932 she served as an alternate in the Landsting. Biography Born on 3 January 1876 in Aarhus, Elisabeth Amalie Petersen was the daughter of the station master Hans Ludvig Schjellerup Parelius (1853‚Äì1930) and Amalie Marie Bendixen (1843‚Äì1895). She was admitted to the Polytechnical Institute in 1899 but broke off her studies shortly afterwards, becoming a teacher at Fru Skjold's girls' school in N√¶stved. In April 1902, she married the lawyer Jacov Oluf Severin Petersen who, like herself, was also interested in politics. When women were first permitted to stand for municipal elections, in 1909 she was elected to N√¶stved Town Council for the Liberal Party, serving until 1921. During the First World War, she successfully oversaw emergency measures, including the establishment of public kitchens. Following the extension of women's voting rights to the Rigsdag in 1915, she became a member both of the board for the N√¶stved district and of the central board for Zealand and Bornholm. After becoming a founding member of the N√¶stved branch of the Danish Women's Society in 1907, she was elected to the organisation's central management board in 1909 and became district president for Zealand in 1916. She did much to support arrangements for children, succeeding in having contributions for single mothers extended to widows with children in 1910. As head of the children's department of the Women's Society, she called for the establishment of more nurseries and care centres for children. Petersen's interest in children led to her becoming the first woman in Denmark to be appointed to a regional school board, namely that of Tybjerg Herred, where she served from 1921 to 1929. In connection with the national elections in 1918, she encouraged women not only to vote but to stand as candidates. The results were however disappointing with only four women being elected to the Folketing and five to the Landsting. Unlike her colleague Gyrithe Lemche, she did not support the establishment of parties consisting only of women but called for women to stand side by side with men in the existing parties. In 1924, she was elected president of the Danish Women's Society, a position she maintained until 1931. She displayed good qualities of leadership, gaining the respect of the membership in her efforts to achieve long-term objectives. On her husband's death in 1928, she moved to Copenhagen where she served in the Landsting and in the Rigsdag. She fought for more gender equity and called for implementation of the 1919 Act on Equal Pay for Women and Men in Public Serves and the 1921 Act on Equal Access to Public Posts and Employment. She also strove to obtain better conditions for housekeeping mothers, calling for the establishment of university courses in housekeeping. Despite suffering from cancer, she held her post at the Landsting until her death. She died in Copenhagen on 7 September 1932 and was buried in N√¶stved.

He sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1830 to 1832. Leader was the oldest son of William Leader, who owned extensive estates in County Cork, including the family's homes at Mount Leader near Millstreet and Dromagh Castle neat Kanturk. After education at Trinity College Dublin, the King's Inn and the Middle Temple, he was called to the Irish bar in 1798. His father's estates included the coal mines of the north Cork coalfield, which Leader developed further with the help of a government loan. An ally of Daniel O'Connell, he unsuccessfully contested the County Cork constituency at the 1812 general election as a supporter of Catholic Emancipation. In 1828, the year he succeeded to his father's estates, he was nominated with O'Connell's support at the Tralee by-election, but was not elected. At the 1830 general election, Leader's name was suggested for several seats, but he was eventually nominated for Kilkenny City as a Liberal supporter of reform. He was re-elected at the 1831 general election, and supported the Reform Acts as they passed through the House of Commons, but vigorously opposed the Irish Reform Bill's failure to significantly expand the franchise. At the 1832 general election he chose not to sign the Repeal Association's pledge and stood down from Parliament. Leader died at Nasville, County Cork on February 1836. His eldest son Nicholas succeeded to his estates, and in 1861 was elected as a Conservative MP for County Cork.

History  The construction of the fort dates back to the 12th century when the city of Kurnool was used as a base for halting before crossing Tungabhadra river. Kurnool was occupied by Vijayanagara ruler Devaraya II and Achyutaraya who succeeded Krishnadevaraya built the initial fort between 1530 and 1542. The fort has different gateways and bastions.

The fort is named after Konda Reddy, the last ruler of Alampur who was imprisoned in the fort by the Kurnool Nawab in the 17th century. Locals and legend state that Konda Reddy was under attack, and used the tunnels that the fort housed to escape. Konda Reddy eventually escaped from the fort, but had to loose his territory to Golconda Nawabs. The tunnels are now locked and closed off from the public, but the fort is open to touring.

She was active in Fort Worth's park league, the Fort Worth Library Association, and the Fort Worth Art Association. Shelton became one of Fort Worth's first female real estate developers and homebuilders. Early life Anna Shelton, born at the family home north of Fort Worth on August 20, 1861, was the youngest of four children born to Dr. John Foster Shelton, Jr. (1826-1891) and Martha Moore Bronaugh Shelton (1831-1874).Texas Department of State Health Services. Texas Death Certificates, 1903‚Äì1982. Austin, Texas, US. Dr. John Shelton was a physician in Tarrant County prior to serving as a surgeon in the Confederate army, leaving his wife to care for the children and homestead. After the Civil War, the Sheltons moved into the city for the children to attend school; Dr. Shelton opened a drugstore on Weatherford Street in downtown Fort Worth. After the death of her mother, Dr. Shelton sent Anna back to Hopkinsville to attend Bethel Women's College, the girls' academy her mother had also attended. Anna returned to Fort Worth to care for her widower father in 1890, and moved in with her sister's family after her father's death the following year. Career A bigamy scandal involving her sister's husband (and Fort Worth mayor), W.S. Pendleton, drove Anna Shelton to eschew traditional women's roles and \\"fashion herself into the civic-minded, informed, 'new woman.' Recognizing that she, as a single woman, had the advantage of sole ownership and control of her property, she mastered real estate law and banking practices and started buying and selling real estate for profit in the late 1890s.\\" Shelton also tutored in English at Fort Worth University, which had been established by the Methodist Episcopal Church on the city's south side in 1881. Deciding she did not want to pursue a teaching career, in 1902 she left her position to study French and Spanish literature in Paris and New York for six months. She ultimately became one of Fort Worth's first female real estate developers and homebuilders, a successful venture that gave her a reputation as a shrewd businesswoman. Among other projects, Shelton was responsible for building a number of homes in the Fairmount neighborhood in Fort Worth's Near Southside. Women's clubs Shelton was a member of the '93 Club and a charter member of the Sorosis Club, two early Fort Worth women's clubs. The '93 Club, named after the year it was formed, focused on literature and art appreciation. Its motto was \\"Knowledge Is Power.\\" In 1903, Shelton was a founder of the Sorosis Club, whose name came from the Latin term for sisters. As an officer in both clubs, a delegate to start and national conventions of women's clubs, the state director on the board of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and officer in the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs, she recognized the need to bring together Fort Worth's many woman's clubs into one umbrella organization with a shared physical space. In 1923, she organized a meeting of leaders from eleven local women's clubs to form a new \\"parent\\" organization, The Woman's Club of Fort Worth. The eleven charter clubs included her own '93 Club and Sorosis Club, as well as the Fort Worth Federation of Women's Clubs, Woman's Wednesday Club, Monday Book Club, Shakespeare Club, Penelope Club, Euterpean Club, History Club, College Women's Club, and Harmony Club. As the founder of The Woman's Club of Fort Worth, she was also named by the club's charter as the first president of its board of directors. The club benefited tremendously from her professional relationships and reputation as a successful businesswoman. With her influence, the club was able to secure bank loans and finance services. Prominent local woman Etta O. Newby even donated the mansion that became the club's first headquarters based on Shelton's business acumen. Under Shelton's leadership, the club expanded its campus, acquiring more property and additional buildings; Anna Shelton Hall is named in her honor. During the Great Depression, the club assumed control of the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra; Shelton was one of two members of The Woman's Club to serve as the symphony's director. In response to criticism of her plans for The Woman's Club of Fort Worth, she is quoted as saying, \\"No one has the right to tell me what I cannot do.\\" Suffering from chronic illness, Shelton retired from the presidency of The Woman's Club in June 1939, having served sixteen years in the position. Shelton has been eulogized as \\"the personality that animated and combined all the facets of Club activities...With her death in 1939, an era of the Club which can never be recaptured passed from the community.\\" Civic involvement During the first decade of the twentieth century, Shelton was active with the city's Park League, serving on its Arbor Day and school gardening competition committees. Shelton was also active in Progressive Era politics, having been selected to represent Tarrant County at the 1920 state Democratic convention in support of Pat Morris Neff's gubernatorial campaign and the party's women's suffrage platform. Shelton was on the board of the Fort Worth Library Association and the Fort Worth Art Association, which organized the city's first public library and art museum, though she was often at odds with library director and fellow clubwoman and suffragist Jennie Scott Scheuber. In 1922, she was among the trustees of the Fort Worth Library Association who petitioned for an amendment to the city charter in an attempt to maintain the Association's control of the library and protect it from municipal government politics. Death Shelton died at Cook Memorial Hospital on August 28, 1939, having suffered from arteriosclerosis for a number of years and enduring a ten-month hospital stay in 1937. Her simple funeral service, led by Reverend Albert Venting of Cleburne, was held at The Woman's Club of Fort Worth's Anna Shelton Hall. She was buried alongside her parents in the Shelton family plot at Pioneers Rest cemetery.

The GRB was determined to be from Earth near the host galaxy 2MASX J12320498-1056010 in the constellation Virgo. The characteristics of GRB 150101B are remarkably similar to the historic event GW170817, a merger of neutron stars. Observations In October 2018, astronomers reported that GRB 150101B, 1.7 billion light years away from Earth, may be analogous to the historic GW170817, a gravitational wave detected in 2017, which is about 130 million light years away, and associated with the merger of two neutron stars. The similarities between the two events, in terms of gamma ray, optical and x-ray emissions, as well as to the nature of the associated host galaxies, are considered \\"striking\\", and this remarkable resemblance suggests the two separate and independent events may both be the result of the merger of neutron stars, and both may be a hitherto- unknown class of kilonova transients. Kilonova events, therefore, may be more diverse and common in the universe than previously understood, according to the researchers. According to one of the study researchers, Eleonora Troja, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big step to go from one detected object to two. Our discovery tells us that events like GW170817 and GRB 150101B could represent a whole new class of erupting objects that turn on and off in X-rays and might actually be relatively common.‚Äù Troja further stated, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been able [to] identify this kilonova without gravitational wave data, so maybe in the future, we‚Äôll even be able to do this without directly observing a gamma-ray burst.‚Äù Another researcher, Geoffrey Ryan, said,‚ÄúWe have a case of cosmic look-alikes. They look the same, act the same and come from similar neighborhoods, so the simplest explanation is that they are from the same family of objects.‚Äù According to co-author, Alexander Kutyrev, ‚ÄúIf the next such observation reveals a merger between a neutron star and a black hole, that would be truly groundbreaking. Our latest observations give us renewed hope that we‚Äôll see such an event before too long.‚Äù Another researcher, Hendrik Van Eerten, noted, ‚ÄúWe need more cases like GW170817 that combine gravitational wave and electromagnetic data to find an example between a neutron star and black hole. Such a detection would be the first of its kind. Our results are encouraging for finding more mergers and making such a detection.\\"  See also  * GRB 080319B * Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory  References   External links  * January 2015 events 20150101 150101B ","title":"GRB 150101B"},{"id":"58789760","text":"Khodayevsky () is a rural locality (a settlement) in 12 let Oktyabrya Selsoviet of Pospelikhinsky District, Altai Krai, Russia.

When Sanju finally reveals his love of Anu to Viswanath, Viswanath is stuck in a dilemma as he needs to keep up his word and be a friend to Sanju by helping him gain Anu's love, while still protecting Anu and trying to keep her away from Sanju's advances. After the hilarious and emotional chaos that ensues, Anu finally reveals to Sanju that she too loved him all along and asks him to take her away and marry her. When Viswanath gets to know about this, he too angrily and emotionally tells Sanju to take her away and marry her as he is very fed up of the situation. However, to Viswanath's shock, Sanju leaves the next morning (Anu's wedding day) while Anu is still at home. Sanju reveals that he did this as he did not want to hurt Viswanath, as he had to be a good friend to him, and he also realised that Viswanth will know best for his daughter. Soon, Viswanath arrives in Kakinda with Anu and happily gives his blessing for them to get married, as he realises that only Sanju can make Anu happy the whole life .

Biography Thoenen studied medicine at the Universities of Bern and Innsbruck, graduating in 1953 and receiving his doctorate from Bern in 1957. In 1961 he joined the research laboratories of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffmann LaRoche, leaving in 1968 to spend a year working with the Axelrod group at NIMH. In 1971 he joined the newly-formed Biocentre at the University of Basel as research group leader in Neurobiology. In 1977 he relocated to Munich where the Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry had offered him the directorship of a new institute - what is now the Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology - which he led until his retirement in 1996. Research While testing dopamine analogues at Hoffman-LaRoche, he was surprised by the toxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine on sympathetic nerves and investigated its mechanisms of action. Its selective effect on dopaminergic neurons has made it a useful tool in animal models of Parkinson's disease. This line of research had an unexpected payoff. While working with Axelrod at NIMH, Thoenen discovered that repeated stimulation of the adrenal medulla led to increased levels of the monoamine synthesis enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. Trans-synaptic enzyme induction had never previously been detected: it transpired that it was a general phenomenon. At Basel, his attention turned to nerve growth factor and other neurotrophins. His laboratory made a series of groundbreaking contributions to the field, including the cloning of brain derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor. Almost all his subsequent research focused on this class of proteins, the elucidation of their physiological functions, and the factors that influenced their expression and release - including other growth factors, the presynaptic release of neurotransmitters, glucocorticosteroids, and stress. His work has been instrumental in demonstrating the importance of neurotrophins for brain plasticity (the formation and pruning of synaptic connections in, for example, learning and memory), and has pursued their relevance for remediating nerve damage and dementia. Awards Thoenen won the Feldberg Award (1980), the Clo√´tta Prize (1985), the Charles A. Dana Award for Pioneering Achievement in Health (1994) and the Neuronal Plasticity Prize (1994). He received the Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience of the Society for Neuroscience (1995) and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Neuroscience Research (1997) jointly with Eric M. Shooter. He was awarded the Ernst Jung Gold Medal in 2007. He was a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and a foreign member of the National Academy of Sciences. He received honorary doctorates from the Universities of W√ºrzburg and Zurich.

It transported goods and was used as a hospital ship transporting wounded troops to land-based treatment facilities. Post-war it was moved to Belgrade and used for housing employees of the Belgrade Excavator Company and their families. Beginning in the 1990s, the ship fell into disrepair. It was finally purchased by Skitrack International, restored and opened to the public as a tourist attraction and a public space in Belgrade, Serbia, in 2016. Names The ship was originally named after the Sip Canal, one of the key strategic positions of the German army on the Danube at Djerdap/Iron Gates gorge during the Second World War. Large and heavy ships have long struggled to move upstream against the fast, strong current of the Danube river. To overcome this, a railroad track was built beside the canal. Trains ran along the track using thick cables to drag ships upstream against the current. As this ship was one of the heaviest in the fleet, it was named Sip. After the Sip Canal was flooded in 1969 with the construction of the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station, the ship was renamed Concrete Ship in accordance with ferryman superstition. History World War II During the Second World War, the global scarcity of raw steel inspired German engineers to design and create concrete ships. They used up to 70% less steel in their construction than traditional steel vessels. The idea of building concrete ships dates back to 1848 in France. Around 100 such ships were constructed in the United States during World War I for similar reasons. Concrete ships are immune to magnetically- triggered naval mines. Adolf Hitler ordered the production of 50 concrete ships to deliver necessary raw materials (such as oil, weaponry, food etc.) through the mine-filled rivers of Nazi Germany. The Sip was built in 1943 in the second round of production. It was constructed in Ostvind (Swinemunde), by Schalenbau KG, Dyckerhoff & Widmann KG. It was part of a fleet that ensured the continuous flow of oil from Romania to Germany, as well as other necessary raw materials along the entire Danube river. Additionally, the ship played an important role in the care and transportation of seriously wounded troops to land-based hospitals in Austria and Germany for further treatment. The Sip had multiple specialized areas for hospital functions: ambulance and operating room, wards for the wounded, hospital mess, storerooms for food, water, and medicines, as well as a staff room. The Sip did not have engines. They were removed to make room for the steam boiler and the central heating system, by which the entire ship was heated during the winter. The ship was essentially a trailer that needed to be propelled by tugboats or other self-propelled boats that also transported raw materials to German army installations. Post- War Ownership of the Sip was transferred to the Belgrade Excavator Company (BBP) after the end of the Second World War as compensation for their ships destroyed by the Luftwaffe. With the central heating system and the partitioned interior already in place, BBP easily transformed it into a \\"housing ship\\" for employees and their families working on the reconstruction of New Belgrade. The Sip was berthed on the right bank of the Sava river not far from the Gazela Bridge. It remained anchored there for more than three decades. It had 20 rooms, four shared bathrooms and sanitary facilities, a large lounge, a living room, a room for a janitor, a boiler room and a large terrace on the ship's deck. It was home to parents who worked for BBP and children who grew up and studied in Belgrade. Many generations grew up on this housing ship. When a family left the ship after fulfilling their contract, another family from the interior of Yugoslavia would move in. \\"Black Days\\" At the beginning of the 1990s, the breakup of Yugoslavia led to the collapse of many companies, including BBP. The Sip, now called the \\"Concrete Ship\\", was left to the workers who maintained it and the local population who secured it until the war years passed. As the bad wartime situation lingered, the \\"Concrete Ship\\", which was still anchored on the right bank of the Sava near the Belgrade Fair, became a place where the homeless and other wanderers found refuge. On New Year's Eve 2009, due to the irresponsibility of the people guarding it, a storm along the rocky coast caused damage to the \\"Concrete Ship\\" and it became partially submerged. As the years passed, the deterioration of the ship was exacerbated by thieves stripping it for secondary raw materials. \\"New Birth\\" After the political upheaval in 2013, and the ambitions of the new Serbian government led by then Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, the preparation of the ground for the implementation of the modern Serbian-Arabic project the \\"Belgrade Waterfront\\" began. The private company Dunav Group Aggregates,, the legal successor of the privatized Belgrade Excavator Company (BBP), was given a deadline to remove the damaged \\"Concrete Ship\\". Due to the very high cost of returning it to seaworthiness, the decision was made to destroy it with mines and clear the coast of its remains. To preserve a valuable and authentic historical object, Skitrack International from Belgrade stepped in to undertake the risk and obligation to rescue the \\"Concrete Ship\\" from complete destruction. They managed to purchased it from Dunav Group Aggregates at the last moment. The restoration of the \\"Concrete Ship\\" took two years. It opened to the public in 2016 as a piece of history, a tourist attraction, and a cultural space. See also *Capella, another concrete ship built in the same period.

Sir Hervey Elwes, 2nd Baronet (c. 1683‚Äì1763), of Stoke-by-Clare, Suffolk, was a British landowner and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1706 and 1722. He had the reputation of being an extreme miser. Early life Elwes was baptized in July 1683, the eldest son of Gervase Elwes of Stoke College and his wife Isabella Hervey, daughter of Sir Thomas Hervey of Ickworth, Suffolk. His father died in about 1687. As a child, he suffered from consumption so that he had a poor constitution and a thin spare body. He was timid, and extremely diffident, had no friends and no interests apart from hoarding up his money and partridge setting. He was admitted at Queens‚Äô College, Cambridge on 22 June 1702. His grandfather Sir Gervase Elwes, 1st Baronet died on 11 April 1706 and he succeeded to the baronetcy and estate. The estate was so debt-ridden that his uncle, John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, advised him either to sell his lands or marry a rich wife. In the event he never married nor sold the estates but lived a life of abject penury. Political career Elwes was a loyal Whig, and succeeded to his grandfather's parliamentary seat. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Sudbury at a by-election on 16 December 1706. He became a Freeman, of Sudbury in 1706. His uncle tried unsuccessfully in 1707 to get him a grant of his grandfather's office under the duchy of Lancaster. He was re-elected at the 1708 general election and voted for Dr Sacheverell's impeachment in 1710. He was defeated at Sudbury in the 1710 election, but was returned unopposed in 1713. He voted in 1714 against the expulsion of Richard Steele. He was returned unopposed again as MP for Sudbury at the 1715 British general election but withdrew from politics in 1722. Later life and legacy Elwes spent the next forty years of his life restoring his fortune by exercising severe economy. Much of the time he spent alone at Stoke, and was described as ‚Äòperhaps the most perfect picture of human penury that ever existed‚Äô. He died unmarried on 22 October 1763, aged about 80. He left at least a quarter of a million to his nephew, John Meggott, who took the name Elwes, and modelling his way of life on his uncle's, became as famous a miser. The baronetcy passed to a cousin.

Festival d'Avignon 1986 Pierre Georges Cornil Jansen (28 February 1930 ‚Äì 13 August 2015 at Saint-Pierre-Saint-Jean)Mort du compositeur Pierre Jansen, fid√®le collaborateur de Claude Chabrol., Le Monde was a French film scores composer. He was in particular the permanent collaborator of Claude Chabrol for whom he composed the music for many films.  Life  Born in Roubaix, Jansen did his first musical studies at the Conservatoire de Roubaix (piano and harmony) under the direction of Alfred Desenclos. He furthered his studies at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels (piano and harmony prizes) and writing studies with Andr√© Souris (harmony, counterpoint, fugue and orchestration). From 1952 onwards, he regularly attended classes with Olivier Messiaen and participated in the Ferienkurse f√ºr die neue Musik in Darmstadt. In 1958, a suite for piano and 18 instruments was premiered in Darmstadt, and later performed in Paris during a concert of the Domaine musical. In 1960, he renounced the achievements of the avant-garde and devoted himself to film music. He collaborated with Claude Chabrol of whom he became the official composer. About Pierre Jansen, the director of the French New Wave said: \\"I met a brother in music.\\" while the latter described his meeting with Chabrol as \\"decisive and unexpected.\\".Quote by Pierre Jansen in an interview given at France Musique He then worked with Claude Goretta, Francis Girod and Pierre Schoendoerffer. He also collaborated for television by composing music for Serge Moati and Jos√©e Dayan. In 1985, he composed for silent cinema, in collaboration with Antoine Duhamel, an extensive score for large orchestra to accompany the images of David Wark Griffith's famous Intolerance. This work was premiered by the Orchestre national d'√éle-de-France (Jacques Mercier conducting) and screened live at the Th√©√¢tre des Amandiers, then at the Festival d'Avignon. A version of this film, newly restored, was made in 2007. It required a new adaptation of the score. Rerecorded under the direction of Jean Deroyer, it was broadcast on Arte. This version is available on DVD. Gradually abandoning film music because he did not want to fall into commercial ease, he then devoted himself to his own work by composing concerts pieces. He taught orchestration at the √âcole normale de musique de Paris, as well as at the Conservatoire de Paris (CNSMDP).

She had two sisters Emine Menije (√ñke) and Mutahhara (Keskiner). Her father, a lawyer, prominent local journalist, poet and a member of the Young Turks, was imprisoned in Adana for opposition to Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II's (reigned 1876‚Äì1909) press censorship. He was killed in the prison on 17 May 1905, three months prior to his release. His death was officially declared as suicide.
