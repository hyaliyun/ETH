GVRR is owned and operated by the City of Grapevine. History and description The railroad operates passenger excursion trains using an 1896-era 4-6-0 steam locomotive and sometimes a diesel engine (an EMD GP7) to pull its 1920s-era Victorian coaches. Passengers board at Grapevine's historic Main Street station and the train operates over a 21-mile (34 kilometer) route to the Fort Worth Stockyards on former trackage that was owned by the St. Louis Southwestern Railway (aka the \\"Cotton Belt\\").http://railfanning.org/2016/03/taking-the- grapevine-vintage-railroad-back-in-time/ The main run starts in Grapevine and goes to the Fort Worth Stockyards. From its stop in the stockyards, the train then runs a separate excursion along the Trinity River to the 8th Ave Yard of the Fort Worth and Western Railroad, then returns to the stockyards. Upon return to the stockyards, the engine turns around via a turntable and runs around the train on a siding, then it departs back toward Grapevine. The route was formerly operated by the FWWR and was known as the Tarantula train. In 1999 and for a short period of time the FWWR contracted with Coe Rail, Inc. for operation of the Tarantula train. An accident with a freight train in 2000 caused the Fort Worth & Western to sever the relationship and took back control of passenger operations. Later that year the City of Grapevine expressed interest to FWWR owner William Davis in owning and operating the Tarantula train. After receiving an offer, the purchase was complete around 2005. The city named their new operation the Grapevine Vintage Railroad (GVRR) with FRA reporting mark: GVRX. Grapevine operated the train under trackage agreements with FWWR. When Trinity Metro began operating their TEXRail commuter line GVRR made arrangements for trackage rights on their right-of-way to Haltom City. From that point on GVRR uses FWWR trackage under the original agreement.  Special Excursions  In addition to the normal Grapevine-Fort Worth and Trinity River runs, GVRR offers many events and special excursions throughout the year. = North Pole Express = By far the railroad's most popular event, the North Pole Express runs every year late-November through December. The station and the train are both decorated for the occasion. For this out-and-back run, the train runs part of the way down the line from Grapevine until it gets to 'Reindeer Ridge', and then reverses back to Grapevine. As riders board the train, they are given a souvenir ticket, and Santa's Elves pass out hot chocolate in a souvenir mug. When the train gets to 'Reindeer Ridge', Mrs. Clause boards the train, and as the train heads back to Grapevine, each child is presented with a silver bell that says 'We Believe'. Back in Grapevine, riders get off the train and enter the North Pole, where they are greeted with a snowy forest path that leads them to Santa's Workshop. Once there, Santa, Mrs. Clause, and the elves perform a short musical, and afterwards guests are offered free pictures with Santa. = Day Out With Thomas = Although it is a short 25-30 minute trip, it is extremely popular for families with small children. For one weekend each year, a replica of Thomas the Tank Engine comes to Grapevine and leads the train for a short out- and-back excursion. At the station, riders will find photo opportunities with Thomas and other characters from the show, as well as activities that vary from year to year. These activities can include but are not limited to the Thomas and Friends Imagination Station, magic shows, live performances, and storytelling. = Kiss Me I'm Irish Express = Another out-and-back excursion, this ride is offered one Saturday in March, and offers riders 21 and older a souvenir Kiss Me I'm Irish mug, two free glasses of beer, and Irish-style hors d'oeuvres and desserts. = Jazz Wine Train = On this out- and-back excursion in mid-March, riders 21 and older experience live jazz music in each coach. Guests receive meals and wine tastings provided by local Grapevine businesses, as well as bottled water and a souvenir wine glass. = Witches Brew Train = Another 21 and older out-and-back trip, this excursion offers guests Halloween-themed food and entertainment, as well as two free glasses of craft beer in a souvenir stein. Costumes are highly encouraged on this run but not required. = Trick 'r' Treat Trains = A halloween themed excursion geared for the whole family. = Additional Seasonal Excursions = Although less popular, the Grapevine Vintage Railroad offers these themed excursions throughout the year: Christmas Wine Trains, After Christmas Trains, Spring Break Trains, Easter Bunny Train, Mother's Day Train, Memorial Day Train, Father's Day Train, Fourth of July Train, and Labor Day Train. Locomotives The \\"Vinny\\" locomotive at the Stockyards = 'Vinny' #2199 = Vinny is a 1953 EMD GP7u diesel locomotive. Originally owned by the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, it was purchased by the Grapevine Vintage Railroad in 2005. Vinny is the most used locomotive on the line while Puffy is down for repair. = 'Puffy' #2248 = The \\"Puffy\\" locomotive at the Stockyards displaying the old Tarantula branding Built by Cooke Locomotive Works in 1896, Puffy is the railroad's 4-6-0 steam locomotive. It was originally owned by the Southern Pacific Railroad for mixed passenger and freight use in California. Later in her life, she was converted into a fire train, and eventually ended up as a ceremonial engine in a private collection. Although at one point Walt Disney was eyeing her for a project that never came to be, she ended up in the hands of the Texas State Railroad in 1976. In 1993 #2248 was purchased by the FWWR. Puffy has been undergoing a complete rails- to-stack overhaul as part of her mandatory FRA inspection. The locomotive is expected to return to service in 2020. However work has stopped due to several reasons on 2248's status. = #2014, #2016 = #2014 and #2016 are two EMD FL9 diesel locomotives that have recently been acquired by the railroad. They were originally owned by the New Haven Railroad, numbered 2041 and 2044, respectively. They were transferred to ConnDOT/MTA Metro-North Railroad for commuter service between New York City and New Haven, CT when the New Haven Railroad was absorbed into Conrail. They remained under ConnDOT ownership until they were placed for sale which is when the FL9 locomotives were purchased by GVRR.

It was an attempt by the Union Army to seize the Boydton and Petersburg Plank Road and cut the South Side Railroad, a critical supply line to Petersburg, Virginia. Background At the Battle of Peebles' Farm earlier in October, the Union V Corps had seized a portion of the Confederate works around Hatcher's Run. The entire II Corps, under Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, was pulled out of the trenches and moved to operate against the Confederates' Boydton Line in conjunction with a simultaneous operation against the Richmond defenses along the Darbytown Road. The II Corps was reinforced by divisions from the V Corps, IX Corps, and Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg's cavalry division already operating in the area. Opposing forces =Union= =Confederate= Battle On October 27, Hancock marched across Hatcher's Run, brushed aside Confederate pickets and moved around the Confederate flank towards Burgess Mill. The division under Brig. Gen. Gershom Mott crossed the Boydton Plank Road and attacked Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton's Confederate cavalry threatening to cut it off from the main Confederate lines. Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill, who commanded the Confederate defenses in the area, reacted quickly to Hancock's threat. However, once his units moved to confront the Federals, Hill, in poor health, proved too sick to continue field command and turned over direction of his corps to Maj. Gen. Henry Heth. Heth put two divisions in Hancock's path, but the Federal commander drove up the Boydton Plank Road and pushed aside the opposing Confederates. At this time both Maj. Gen. George G. Meade and Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant rode out to the battlefield, where Meade immediately noticed a gap between Hancock and the V Corps. With the South Side Railroad still away, Meade realized that continuing the advance would only further isolate the II Corps, and so ordered Hancock to halt. Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford's V Corps division was ordered to link with the II Corps but became caught up in the dense woods. General Grant, meanwhile, made a personal reconnaissance of the Confederate works and, after coming under fire, determined that the Confederates were too strong and called off the offensive. Having never linked up with Crawford's division, Hancock's corps returned to Hatcher's Run crossing but found it blocked by Confederate cavalry. This left the entire II Corps isolated on the north side of Hatcher's Run without support. With the memory of Reams's Station infusing them, Heth and Hampton saw a golden opportunity to destroy the whole II Corps. Hancock's only line of retreat was the Dabney Mill Road, for which Heth was now aiming. Late in the afternoon, Brig. Gen. William Mahone's division attacked through the same woods that had stopped Crawford and seized the Dabney Mill Road, while a Confederate cavalry division under Maj. Gen. W.H.F. \\"Rooney\\" Lee moved up behind the Federals. Mahone moved so far around the Federal flank that Brig. Gen. Thomas W. Egan's II Corps division was forced to completely change fronts. Hancock was now surrounded on 3 sides with no line of retreat. But unlike at Reams's Station, the II Corps did not panic, and Hancock seized the initiative. Mahone had almost been too successful and found his division isolated in turn. Hancock ordered an attack on both Confederate flanks. Hampton failed to hold off the Union cavalry and Gregg was able to move up and aid in routing Mahone. The tables had thus turned and the Confederates, now threatened with encirclement, retreated up the Boydton Plank Road. Hancock retained his hold on the Boydton Plank Road and Grant left to him the decision whether to remain or withdraw to the initial Union lines. Although Hancock had repulsed the Confederate attack, his position was still very unstable. That night Hancock marched his men back to their original position. Aftermath With October nearly over, both armies settled into winter quarters. The Confederates maintained their hold on the Boydton Plank Road throughout the winter. Hancock had won a tactical victory over Heth's Confederates, partially erasing the stain of the rout at Reams's Station. No further significant action occurred on any front around Petersburg for the rest of the year. The Battle of the Boydton Plank Road marked the last battle of two distinguished Union generals in the Army of the Potomac. The following month, Winfield Hancock resigned from field command due to complications with the wound he received at Gettysburg. Then in January 1865, David McM. Gregg unexpectedly resigned his command. His letter of resignation alluded to an anxiety of being away from his home. Meade's chief-of-staff, Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys, assumed command of the II Corps and would resume the offensive against the Boydton Plank Road in February of the following year.

The plot revolves around a movement on the planet Vulcan to secede from the United Federation of Planets. The book alternates chapters that advance the main plotline with chapters that relate important scenes from Vulcan's history, and much of the book explores underlying themes in Vulcan philosophy and culture, especially the idea of cthia, a Vulcan philosophical (and possibly religious, depending on interpretation) concept translated in the book as \\"reality-truth ‚Äî seeing things the way they really are, instead of the way we would like to see them\\". Plot synopsis Certain Vulcan organizations, many with anti-human biases, have begun a movement calling for the secession of Vulcan from the United Federation of Planets, citing the emotionality and unpredictability of humans as dangerous factors for the further development of the planet Vulcan. The dispute is to be resolved by a planetwide vote, with televised debates by important figures for a certain time period beforehand. James T. Kirk and the rest of the crew of the Enterprise are called away from shore leave on Earth in order to serve as diplomats for Vulcan, arguing against the secession, as the odds that Vulcan will leave the Federation are considered very high. Spock, being half-human and half-Vulcan as well as a prominent Starfleet officer, is seen as one of the most important figures in the debate. While on Vulcan, the crew discovers (mostly through detective work by Dr. Leonard McCoy, using the aid of a sentient computer named \\"Moira\\" resident on the Enterprise) that the secession movement was sparked at least partially by T'Pring, Spock's childhood bride- mate, who has nursed a grudge against Kirk and Spock for years for the deception involved in their participation in the koon-ut-kalifee ceremony (described in the original series episode \\"Amok Time\\"). Using the financial resources and connections available to her after the death of Stonn, T'Pring funded many of the organizations seeking to spark anti-human prejudice in the larger Vulcan population, as well as arranging favorable contracts for them regarding Federation property that would revert to the care of the Vulcan government should the secession take place. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy consult heavily with Sarek, Spock's father and head ambassador from Vulcan to the Federation, and Amanda Grayson, his mother, regarding how to inform the Vulcan population of the corruption, but are interrupted by the news that T'Pau, a Vulcan elder and possibly the most respected living figure on Vulcan at that point, is dying. T'Pau makes the decision to transfer her katra (in a sense, her soul) to Amanda, instead of another Vulcan, proving her trust in certain members of the human race, and tells Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sarek, and Amanda that since T'Pring's plot was able to thrive in secrecy and subterfuge, it should be countered with openness and honesty, and that the information should simply be given to the Vulcan population. The news of the corruption throws the planet into turmoil, but the news of her death and cross-species katra transfer brings it to a muted standstill. By this point, Kirk and McCoy (who were, with Spock, invited to participate in the debates as Starfleet representatives), have already given their arguments against secession. Spock's argument concludes the debates, and the planet votes on the secession, which is decided by a large margin in favor of remaining in the Federation. Points of note Only half the book is devoted to the main plotline dealing with Spock, Kirk, McCoy, Sarek, Amanda, and T'Pring, with the remaining chapters retelling important scenes from the history of Vulcan. The \\"Vulcan chapters\\" chronicle the evolution of the Vulcan species from gentle forest- dwellers on a paradisical planet through the solar flare that decimated it and turned it into the desert it is known as in Star Trek continuity, to an incredibly warlike species slowly developing psychic powers through genetics and social breeding programs, through the development of space age technology, to the teaching and adoption of \\"cthia\\" (loosely translated as \\"reality- truth\\") by Surak as a unifying philosophy that ends millennia of war by the Vulcan race. These chapters conclude with the initial meeting of Sarek and Amanda Grayson and their decision to bear and raise Spock. The book is also notable for an understanding of actual scientific principles that many of the future technologies described in the book would have to implement, such as principles of linguistics, particle physics, and artificial intelligence. While obviously required to diverge somewhat from modern science by the necessities of remaining true to Star Trek continuity, possible and somewhat plausible details of implementation are given for a number of important technologies. The word \\"cthia\\" itself is not translated by the universal translation devices used by Kirk (who does not speak Vulcan), reflecting an understanding of difficulty in accurately translating complex cultural concepts between languages (almost always encountered in actual linguistics). McCoy, however, has taken a biochemical language-learning aid to assist his understanding of Vulcan, which is described as a \\"RNA messenger sequence\\" and works by biochemically adding cells to his brain that provide an understanding of Vulcan; RNA (or ribonucleic acid) is a main carrier of genetic information regarding protein synthesis in actual biology. \\"Moira\\" is the name of a computer on the Enterprise in the book that has been given artificial intelligence and a female personality and who uses \\"her\\" innate understanding of computers to retrieve information for Dr. McCoy, and is also presented in a way consistent with modern A.I. science at the time of the book's writing. Also notably, \\"she\\" argues against a fundamental difference between human intelligence and her own, using the phrase \\"protein chauvinist\\" to describe humans who believe their intelligence to be intrinsically superior to that of a computer with similar cognitive abilities. Continuity The book, which says that Surak was killed by terrorists, is contradicted by later televised Star Trek. Star Trek: Enterprise establishes that Surak instead had been killed by radiation poisoning. The book also alludes to the prior novel Strangers from the Sky in describing first contact between Humans and Vulcans, both of which were superseded by the film Star Trek: First Contact. Influence The novel spent eight weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List in 1988. The novel is a favorite of the 2009 film's co-writer Roberto Orci.

The Aktion began on December 21, and was carried out by Romanian soldiers, gendarmes, Ukrainian police, civilians from Golta,A district of Transnistria, see map. and local ethnic Germans under the commander of the Ukrainian regular police, Kazachievici. Thousands of disabled and ill inmates were forced into two locked stables, which were doused with kerosene and set ablaze, burning alive all those inside. Other inmates were led in groups to a ravine in a nearby forest and shot in their necks. The remaining Jews dug pits with their bare hands in the bitter cold, and packed them with frozen corpses. Thousands of Jews froze to death. A break was made for Christmas, but the killing resumed on December 28. By December 31, over 40,000 Jews had been killed.

Morrell, Airline Finance (Ashgate, 1997), p. 153. Details In a typical ETC transaction, a \\"trust certificate\\" is sold to investors in order to finance the purchase of an aircraft by a trust managed on the investors' behalf. The trust then leases the aircraft to an airline, and the trustee routes payments through the trust to the investors. Upon maturity of the note, the airline receives title to the aircraft. The lease is not a \\"true\\" lease because the airline receives title at the end. Therefore, ETCs are a form of secured debt financing similar to a mortgage. Because the aircraft is not owned by the airline until maturity, the aircraft is not considered airline property for the purposes of bankruptcy; however, alternative forms of financing such as mortgage and securitization lead to the same result, making this a relatively minor advantage in comparison to the tax benefits.Morrell, pp. 186-187. An Enhanced ETC, also known as a Double-E TC, is similar to a conventional ETC except that the security has been divided into two or more classes of securities, each with different payment priorities and asset claims. The more senior certificates (those with highest priority) have a higher credit rating and may obtain an investment grade rating for the particular issue. EETCs issues are similar to securitization transactions in that ownership remains with a separate trust rather than the operator, which has different tax implications.

It was presented to the President of Finland by Culture Minister Tanja Karpela. The amendment was accepted by the Finnish parliament in a vote on 5 October 2005. It came into effect on 1 January 2006. Purpose The purpose of the amendment was to update the copyright legislation for the special features of digital and network environments, and apply the changes required by the EU Copyright Directive. The amendment additionally includes national legislation solutions independent of the directive. The main features of the amendment are: * Unauthorized file sharing can be punished as a crime, even though it wouldn't be done for profit. * Downloading illegal copies on the Internet will be prohibited. Downloading for personal use won't be punished, but it may lead to claims for damages, if the copier knows or should have known that the source is illegal. * Importing illegally manufactured works and material is prohibited. * Circumventing copy prevention measures (i.e. DRM) to copy a work is prohibited. Circumventing the protection to watch or listen to the work is still legal. * Works bought from outside the European Economic Area may be distributed only if the first sale inside EEA was accepted by the author. A work bought for personal use may be distributed as before. * Archives, libraries and museums may produce copies of works for internal use using whatever technique necessary. Showing the work on a computer screen inside the facility is allowed. * Works may be copied using special techniques for people with disabilities without permission. * A published work may be presented publicly in services of worship and education without permission. Controversy =Prohibition of circumventing copy protection= Section 50a of the new law prohibits copying works for personal use if the work is protected by an \\"effective technical measure\\". Even an effective protection may be circumvented to watch or listen to the work, though. The restriction has been a subject of controversy and the interpretation is yet to see. Open questions are e.g. whether it's legal to circumvent a copy protection to convert the work to a format usable on a portable MP3 player, or whether a copy-protected CD can be reproduced as a standards-compliant audio CD to listen to it on a car radio. =Freedom of speech= Section 50b prohibits distributing products or services that make possible or facilitate the circumvention of copy protection. The preamble says that offering these services in an organized or commercial manner would be the kind of distribution that the law refers to. This has been seen as restricting the freedom of speech. Reception A demonstration against the bill was held in the afternoon of 4 October 2005. According to an estimate by the police, roughly 300 people participated. Almost all attendees were young adults and all political youth organizations from political right to left supported the demonstration.

It was built by hotelier E.M. Statler as part of his Statler Hotels chain. A prototype of the grand American hotel, it was called a \\"city within a city\\" and also contains an adjoining office building. It was the first hotel in the world to offer in-room radio in every room.  History  During the hotel's construction, it was discovered that the Statler's planned 155 foot height exceeded the maximum height of allowed by the Massachusetts State Building Code. However the building was granted a special exemption by Mayor James Michael Curley, making it the tallest building in the city for a time, with the exception of the Boston Custom House. The building, filling an entire triangular city block, has two uses. The western half houses the hotel, while the eastern half has, since the building's construction, served as offices. The hotel opened on March 10, 1927 as the Statler Hotel Boston. The Statler chain was sold to Hilton Hotels in 1954 and the hotel was renamed the Statler Hilton Boston. In December 1976 Hilton announced its plan to close the Statler Hilton Boston, which was prevented when the Irving M. Saunders family purchased the hotel and renamed it The Boston Park Plaza Hotel & Towers. The Saunders Hotel Group (Roger Saunders and sons) sold the Boston Park Plaza in 1997 to Starwood Hotels & Resorts. In 2011 Starwood sold the hotel for $126 million to a partnership between Highgate Hotels, Rockpoint Group, and the Donald Saunders Family, LLC. Two years later the Highgate/Rockpoint/Saunders partnership sold the hotel for $250 million to the Sunstone Hotel Investors REIT who retained Highgate to manage the hotel, and shortened the hotel's name to simply Boston Park Plaza. In 2016 Sunstone completed a $100 million renovation of the hotel and received a Four Diamond Award from AAA. In 2010, the hotel's Swan's Cafe was named one of the Top 5 Tea Houses in New England by Yankee magazine; it has since closed. From 1994 through 2018, the Boston Park Plaza was a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Park Plaza's HHoA listing was removed in early 2018. = Other tenants = The Statler Hotel building was also home to the Northern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite from 1927 to 1968, and radio station WEZE's broadcast studio from 1957 to 1977. George Carlin worked briefly as a DJ at WEZE in 1957.

It was written by Bill Wrubel and directed by series producer James Burrows. The episode was broadcast live on NBC in the United States on September 29, 2005, and was performed twice by the actors that evening for the East and West coasts. Alec Baldwin guest starred in \\"Alive and Schticking\\" and received an Emmy Award nomination for his performance. In the episode, Grace (Debra Messing) contemplates having an affair with a married man, while Jack (Sean Hayes) begins a new career as the host of his new talk show Jack Talk. Meanwhile, Will (Eric McCormack) tries to hide from Karen (Megan Mullally) the fact that her husband, Stan, is alive and faked his death due to troubles with the mob. Will also tries to stop his former boss, Malcolm (Baldwin), from dating Karen. Will & Grace creators and executive producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick were in favor of doing a live episode, and Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, thought it would be a good way to inaugurate the (at the time) final season of the show. Since airing, \\"Alive and Schticking\\" has received mostly positive reviews from television critics, who enjoyed watching the mistakes made by the actors and their attempts to hide their laughter during the live broadcast. The episode acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.81 and garnered the series' highest rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic since February 17, 2005, and biggest overall viewer total since February 24, 2005. Plot Will (Eric McCormack) reveals to Grace (Debra Messing) that Karen's (Megan Mullally) husband Stan is still alive. He learned this from his former boss, Malcolm (Alec Baldwin), a secret agent, who told him that Stan is now living under seclusion and faked his death because of troubles with the mob. Will makes Grace promise that she keep this information to herself, but she breaks the promise and tells Jack (Sean Hayes). When Malcolm later visits Will at his apartment and warns him to not to tell people about Stan's predicament, Karen and Rosario (Shelley Morrison) also arrive. At meeting Karen, Malcolm becomes fond of her, as does Karen of him, even asking him out on a date, to which he accepts. Will, however, tells Malcolm that he cannot date Karen because Malcolm is still protecting Stan from the mob. Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are discussing their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men as a legitimate reason to have an affair with a married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her. Production Alec Baldwin guest starred on Will & Grace at the request he get to work alongside Megan Mullally, who plays Karen on the show. \\"Alive and Schticking\\" was written by Bill Wrubel and directed by series producer James Burrows. In July 2005, it was announced by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) that Will & Grace's season premiere for season eight would be performed live. It was also confirmed that actor Alec Baldwin would appear in the episode. This was Baldwin's third appearance, as he guest starred in two episodes from season seven, playing Will's boss. His initial decision to do the show was to work with Megan Mullally, who plays Karen; \\"I just love Megan. And so I said, 'Well, if you let me do it with Megan.' And they said 'You got it.' So I went and did that with them for four [episodes]. It was fun. For me now, it's about who I work with.\\" Will & Grace creators and executive producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick were in favor of doing a live episode; \\"We love the idea of a live episode because we get to show the audience of Will & Grace what we've known from day one ‚Äî we work with the best cast in network television,\\" said Mutchnick. He noted that the live element would allow the writers to make changes in the script right up until the airing of the episode. Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, said the \\"challenging live platform launch\\" for Will & Grace would be a good way for the show to inaugurate its final season. In discussion of the episode, Burrows, the director of all Will & Grace episodes, commented: \\"This will be like the classic golden era of television that I was weaned on, where the audience sees everything. Directing a live broadcast will be a first for me, and as long as I have been in the business, there are very few firsts.\\" Debra Messing, in regards to the episode, said that the live premiere started the show's final season in a special way. Upon learning about the live telecast, the cast had mixed emotions. Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was nervous about the episode and hoped there would be cue cards. Debra Messing (Grace) \\"gasped loudly\\" when it was revealed that the technical demands of live television would mean that Burrows would not be directing on the stage floor, but would be up in a booth instead. Messing noted that she had never done live television, but in regards to the live broadcast, said, \\"It starts out our final season in a real special way.\\" Eric McCormack (Will) was intrigued about the idea and seemed to be ready for whatever happened; \\"It keeps it interesting for us. It stirs it up. It gives us a new way to do it.\\" Mullally revealed that the show's writing team was \\"notorious for tinkering with the script's laugh lines\\", even during the actual taping of the episodes. She hoped they would resist that urge for the live episode. Messing, however, was sure that the writers would interfere during the broadcasts; \\"I have a gut feeling that, like, 10 minutes before we go they'll be like, 'Oh, no, no, you know what? Change this line to this. Now we're locked ‚Äì go.'\\" Prior to the live episode, the cast had shot the second, third and fourth episodes of the season. Shortly before this episode, Mullally injured her foot and was unable to walk without crutches. The writers therefore had to put Mullally's character, Karen, in a cast and a motorized scooter, ostensibly because the character was recovering from an operation to correct a webbed toe. \\"Alive and Schticking\\" was performed live twice for viewers in the East and West coasts, with different jokes for each broadcast. The first show was broadcast at 8:30 p.m. (ET) for the East (this feed also aired live at 7:30 p.m. in the Central Time Zone) and the second three hours later at 11:30 p.m. ET (8:30pm PT) for the West. During the two performances, Messing and Hayes had \\"attacks of the giggles\\". An audience member who was in attendance commented that Messing and Hayes \\"were so bad at keeping a straight face\\" during a dress rehearsal that Burrows had to get on the show's PA system to yell at them. After both telecasts were aired, Burrows revealed that McCormack, Messing, Hayes, Mullally, and Baldwin \\"had a ball, but they also dreaded it.\\" Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Alive and Schticking\\" was watched by 9.81 million households, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode received a 4.4 rating/11 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. It also scored the series' highest 18‚Äì49 rating since February 17, 2005, and biggest overall viewer total since February 24, 2005. \\"Alive and Schticking\\" finished 21st in the weekly ratings for the week of September 26‚ÄìOctober 2, 2005. In 2006, Baldwin was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the \\"Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series\\" category for this episode. Dana Stevens of Slate magazine wrote that Eric McCormack \\"never lost his cool throughout the episode; he was the most professional\\". \\"Alive and Schticking\\" received positive reviews. Fort Worth Star-Telegram contributor Robert Philpot, who gave the episode a B+ rating, thought it was a pleasant surprise and an indication that there \\"might be some life\\" left in the show. He added that the episode feels fresher because of the \\"rapid-fire dialogue, farcical situations and ubiquitous double-entendres. And although this live edition was inarguably a stunt, it did prove that real people ‚Äî and not mere machines ‚Äî laugh at the characters and the jokes.\\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also noted that the episode showed that Will & Grace still had a bit of life left.

He moved to Germany in 1912, where he earned a doctorate in zoology from the University of Leipzig in 1915. During World War I he served in the German army. Mertens worked at the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt for many years, beginning as an assistant in 1919, and retiring as Director Emeritus in 1960. He also became a lecturer at Goethe University Frankfurt in 1932, and became a Professor there in 1939. Both jobs provided him with ample time for extensive travel and the study of lizards. He collected specimens in 30 countries. During World War II, he evacuated most of the collections of the Senckenberg Museum to small towns. He also had German soldiers who were fighting overseas collect and ship specimens to him. He was the author of several books on zoology, including La Vie des Amphibiens et Reptiles (1959). Mertens described at least 64 reptile species,Reptile species described by Mertens, according to the Reptile Database. and numerous amphibian species.Amphibian species described by Mertens, according to Amphibian Species of the World 6.0, an Online Reference.

The station, owned by Rogers Communications, airs a country music, news and sports format. The station originally launched in 1967 at 93.7 FM, and was acquired by Northern Broadcasting, the owners of CFCH. In 1979, CKAT adopted a country music format and moved to 101.9 FM. In 1980, CKAT and CFCH were sold to Telemedia. In 1996, Telemedia swapped the stations in a move similar to its 1990 switch involving CKSO and CIGM in Sudbury. CKAT took over CFCH's AM frequency, and CFCH moved to the FM station and adopted the new callsign CKFX. In 2002, Telemedia sold the stations to Standard Broadcasting, who shortly sold them to Rogers. In fall 2005, CKAT and CIGM underwent a format change, with country music cut back (although not entirely eliminated) in favour of increased news and sports programming. Since the change, both stations used the following slogans such as \\"Today's Country\\", \\"News Leader\\" and \\"Sports Leader\\". The station's general manager is Peter McKeown, a former morning man for many years on CHUR and CKAT.

It is equal to the number of seats available multiplied by the number of miles or kilometers flown. An available seat mile is the fundamental unit of production for a passenger-carrying airline.ATA handbook A unit in this case is one seat, available for sale, flown one mile. For example, an aircraft with 300 seats available for sale flying 1,000 statute miles would generate 300,000 ASMs for that particular flight. That the seats are available for sale is critical. An aircraft that had 300 seats but which was limited (for regulatory or technical reasons) to selling only 250 of them on a particular flight of 1,000 miles would generate 250,000 ASMs on that flight, not 300,000. Similarly, if passenger seats on a particular flight are dedicated to crew rest purposes, such seats would not be included in the calculation of ASMs for that flight.  Related quantities  = Cost per ASM / ASK (CASM / CASK) = Seat cost and trip cost for widebodies CASM (or CASK) is a commonly used measure of unit cost in the airline industry. CASM is expressed in cents to operate each seat mile offered, and is determined by dividing operating costs by ASMs. This number is frequently used to allow a cost comparison between different airlines or for the same airline across different time periods (say for one year vs the preceding year). A lower CASM means that it is easier for the airline to make a profit, as they have to charge less to break even. A low CASM, however, is by no means a guarantee of profitability. Further, CASM should only be compared across airlines with care. For instance, all other things being equal, an airline with a longer average stage length will have a lower CASM, because fixed costs will account for a lower portion of its total costs. For this reason, to be meaningful, CASM comparisons across different airlines generally require, at a minimum, that CASMs for all airlines be adjusted to a common stage length, or that the CASMs be graphed versus the stage length of all the airlines being compared. CASM is generally calculated for a particular airline (or portion of an airline‚Äîfor instance, an airline's Pacific operations as opposed to the entire airline) for a particular period of time‚Äîa year, a quarter, a month and so forth. It can also be calculated for a particular route of an airline. However, when it is calculated for anything other than the entire operation of an airline, the relevant costs will inevitably involve cost allocations that require judgments. For instance, the salary of the airline's senior management needs to be spread across the different parts of the airline and can be divvied up across its routes according to many different methodologies‚Äîby the number of flights on that route during that time period, by the number of flight hours on that route, etc. There is not necessarily any right method for making such cost allocations, but it is important when making comparisons across airlines that if an allocation methodology is relevant (i.e. less than the entire of each airline is being compared) then the same allocation methodology is used with each airline being compared. For a simple example of the calculation of CASM, in the second quarter of 2011, Southwest Airlines (including its AirTran Airways subsidiary) had operating costs of $3.929 bn and 31.457 bn ASMs, as reflected in Southwest's SEC Form 10-Q for that period.U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: Form 10-Q for Southwest Airlines Southwest's system CASM for the second quarter of 2011 was then: CASM = Direct Operating Cost / Available Seat Mile = $3.929 billion / 31.457 billion = 12.49 cents = Ex-fuel CASM or CASM ex-fuel = CASM excluding fuel is a commonly used measure to compare the cost performance of airlines excepting the cost of fuel. Due to the volatility of oil prices, airline fuel cost is generally not viewed as controllable (other than in the short-term via fuel hedging). Therefore, management's success at controlling costs is often judged by looking at how the airline's ex-fuel CASM changes from one period to another. For instance, in the second quarter of 2011 Southwest Airlines had fuel costs of $1.527 billion (again, including its AirTran subsidiary). Southwest's system CASM ex-fuel for the second quarter of 2011 was then: CASM ex-fuel = (Direct Operating Cost - Fuel Cost) / Available Seat Mile = ($3.929 billion - $1.527 billion) / 31.457 billion = 7.63 cents Again, care must be taken in comparing CASM ex-fuel across periods. In particular, if average stage length for the airline has changed significantly, this could have a significant impact on CASM ex-fuel. Southwest Airlines‚Äô first-quarter of 2018 CASM excluding fuel and special charges was 8.65 cents, roughly equivalent to JetBlue Airways and more than 20% lower than American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, while ULCCs are lower like Spirit Airlines at 5.83 cents while Frontier Airlines' is undisclosed. = Revenue per ASM (RASM) = RASM is a commonly used measure of unit revenue for airlines, expressed in cents received for each available seat mile and determined by dividing various measures of operating revenue by Available Seat Miles. This number is frequently used to allow a comparison between different airlines or a comparison of the same airline across periods. In theory, the higher the RASM the more profitable the airline should be, assuming that the CASM remains constant. Various measures of revenue may be used. Passenger RASM (or PRASM) is passenger (or scheduled ticket) revenue per ASM. Operating RASM or Total RASM is the airline's total operating revenue per ASM. So, for instance, in the second quarter of 2011, Southwest had scheduled revenue of $3.876 bn and total operating revenue of $4.136 bn. Southwest's system Passenger RASM and Operating RASM for the second quarter of 2011 were therefore: Passenger RASM = $3.876 billion / 31.457 billion = 12.32 cents Operating RASM = $4.136 billion / 31.457 billion = 13.15 cents Again, RASM comparisons across periods or across airlines also need to be made with care. All else being equal, revenue generally increases with average stage length. However, revenue generally does not increase as quickly as stage length, meaning that RASM typically decreases as average stage length increases. At constant prices, world airlines RASK fell by 51% from US¬¢17.5 in 1960 to 8.6 cents in 2015, while CASK went 54% down from 17.5 to 8.1. For the world airline industry between 2003 and 2017, CASK excluding fuel was around US¬¢6, fuel CASK was between US¬¢1 and US¬¢3.5, and RASK was between US¬¢7 and US¬¢10.

Biography Richard was born around 1060, the third son of William of the Principate, a Norman count, and Mary, daughter of Guy, the Lombard duke of Sorrento. He was also one of the many nephews of Robert Guiscard and Roger I of Sicily and in his early life Richard participated with his two famous uncles to the conquest of Sicily. In 1097, Richard joined his cousins, Bohemund of Taranto and Tancred, in their army on the First Crusade. Richard and Tancred were notable for being among the few Crusaders who could speak Arabic, an ability doubtlessly learned during the wars in Sicily, which had a strong Arab presence. Anna Komnene relates that when Richard crossed the Adriatic Sea, his ship was attacked and captured by the Byzantine fleet, who had mistaken him for a pirate. He was soon released and joined the main Crusader army marching through Bulgaria and Hungary. Along with Tancred, Richard refused to swear an oath of fidelity to the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus, preferring to cross the Bosphorus in secret. Richard was one of the commanders at the Battle of Dorylaeum in the summer of 1097. Richard and Tancred joined Bohemund at the siege of Antioch. Richard was among those captured with Bohemund in 1100 when ambushed by the Danishmends at the Battle of Melitene. From there Richard was sent to the emperor Alexius, who imprisoned him in Constantinople before he was finally released in 1103. His cousin Tancred then appointed him governor of Edessa in the winter of 1104, a city which he ruled until 1108. He was bitterly hated by the citizens of Edessa for being ruthless and greedy. During this time, Richard also acted as a diplomat, traveling to France and Italy and arranging the marriage of Bohemund to the princess Constance of France. He was a witness of the 1108 Treaty of Devol. He also participated in the ultimately disastrous campaigns Bohemund waged against the emperor Alexius, but may have been secretly plotting with Alexius against Bohemund. After Bohemund's death in 1111, Richard retired to Marash, where he died in the great earthquake of November 29, 1114.

Biography =Early life= Hiroaki Aoki was born in Tokyo, the son of Katsu and Yunosuke Aoki. Aoki and some friends started a rock and roll band called Rowdy Sounds, though Aoki eventually abandoned music for athletics. He would later explain, \\"I play bass. But I tell you why I change to wrestling: No good on tempo.\\" Aoki attended Keio University, where he competed in track and field, karate, and wrestling before being expelled for fighting. He qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics for wrestling in Rome, but did not compete. However, he later toured the United States and was undefeated in the wrestling 112-pound flyweight class. Aoki was offered wrestling scholarships from several different American colleges. He attended Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts, and later transferred to CW Post College on Long Island. =Move to the United States= He moved to New York City, going on to win the United States flyweight title in 1962, 1963 and 1964. He was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1995. =Restaurant business= In New York, Aoki worked seven days a week in an ice cream truck that he rented in Harlem while studying restaurant management at New York City Community College. After he received his associate degree in management in 1963, he used the $10,000 he had saved from the ice cream business to convince his father to co-invest in the first Benihana, a four- table teppanyaki restaurant on West 56th Street. \\"Benihana\\", taken from the Japanese name for safflower, was suggested by Aoki's father. According to family legend, Aoki's father was walking through the bombed-out ruins of post- war Tokyo when he happened across a single red safflower growing in the rubble. =Personal life= Rocky, who was married three times, once said that he had \\"three kids from three different women at exactly the same time.\\" He found out about the seventh with the third woman when he was sued for paternity. In 1973, Aoki launched Genesis, a softcore pornographic men's magazine. The title changed hands several times, eventually becoming an explicit publication long after Aoki's period of ownership. Despite not enjoying the mainstream popularity of rivals Playboy and Penthouse, the magazine remained in activity for nearly 40 years. Aoki partially funded and crewed the Double Eagle V, the first balloon to successfully cross the Pacific Ocean. The Double Eagle V launched from Nagashima, Japan on November 10, 1981, and landed in Mendocino National Forest in California 84 hours and 31 minutes later. It traveled a record . The Double Eagle V's four-man crew consisted of Rocky Aoki with Albuquerque balloonists Ben Abruzzo, Larry Newman, and Ron Clark. Overshadowed by the concurrent Space Shuttle mission STS-2, the Double Eagle V failed to attract the same degree of media attention as the earlier Double Eagle flights. After injuries suffered in a 1982 accident, the Tenafly, New Jersey resident told sportswriters that he was leaving the sport. He was an offshore powerboat racer along with the 1986 APBA world champion Powerboat throttleman Errol Lanier, a former Fort Lauderdale, Florida fireman who saved his life in a near fatal powerboat crash in 1979 under the Golden Gate Bridge. His third wife was Keiko Aoki, a businesswoman that he married in 2002.Kawaguchi, Judit Keiko Aoki May 28, 2009 Japan Times; retrieved April 13, 2017.Benihana founder's third wife loses bid for fortune March 31, 2016, timesunion.com; retrieved April 14, 2017. Before his death, he became a United States citizen. Insider trading On June 9, 1998, Aoki was charged with insider trading and profiting by more than $590,000 from it. The U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn, N.Y. charged Aoki with six counts of insider trading and one count of conspiracy based on trading upon inside information about Spectrum Information Technologies Inc. According to the indictment, Aoki learned through Donald Kessler, a former stock promoter, inside information concerning Spectrum's imminent hiring of John Sculley, then-chairman of Apple Computer Inc., as the chairman of Spectrum, and bought 200,000 shares of Spectrum stock. That stock rose 46% the day that this hiring was publicized. In 1999, Aoki pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and was fined $500,000 and given three years' probation. This incident was mentioned briefly in the 2013 Scorsese film \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\". Other In 2005, he sued four of his children (Grace, Kevin, Kyle, and Echo) for an alleged attempt to take control of the companies he founded, which, at the time, had an estimated value between US$60‚Äì100 million. Death Aoki died of pneumonia in New York City. At the time of his death he had been suffering from diabetes, Hepatitis C, and cirrhosis of the liver. His hepatitis was reportedly the result of a blood transfusion after a 1979 speedboat crash under the Golden Gate Bridge. At the time of his death, Rocky Aoki had seven children and was married to his third wife Keiko. These included musician Steve Aoki and model Devon Aoki. His grave is at the cemetery attached to Joshin temple in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo. Honors Aoki was the recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence.

CBD symptoms typically begin in people from 50 to 70 years of age, and the average disease duration is six years. It is characterized by marked disorders in movement and cognition, and is classified as one of the Parkinson plus syndromes. Diagnosis is difficult, as symptoms are often similar to those of other disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and dementia with Lewy bodies, and a definitive diagnosis of CBD can only be made upon neuropathologic examination.  Signs and symptoms  Because CBD is progressive, a standard set of diagnostic criteria can be used, which is centered on the disease's evolution. Included in these fundamental features are problems with cortical processing, dysfunction of the basal ganglia, and a sudden and detrimental onset. Psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions, although present in CBD, are much less prevalent and lack establishment as common indicators of the presence of the disease. Although corticobasal degeneration has a plethora of symptoms, some are more prevalent than others. In a study of 147 patients with CBD, it was found that all of them had at least one Parkinsonian sign, 95% having two and 93% had some higher order dysfunction (cognitive impairments like acalculia, sensory loss, dementia, neglect, etc.). In a separate study of 14 patients recorded 3 years after the onset of symptoms, many patients had high numbers of motor symptoms. 71% had bradykinesia (slow movements), 64% showed apraxia, 43% reported limb dystonia, and although more cognitive 36% had dementia. In another study of 36, over half had a useless/alien arm and 27% had a gait impediment[21]. From this we can see why CBD is hard to diagnose. Even if it can be distinguished as different from one of the other similar diseases, the varying combinations of symptoms creates a difficult path to diagnosis. = Motor and associated cortical dysfunctions = Some of the most prevalent symptom types in people exhibiting CBD pertain to identifiable movement disorders and problems with cortical processing. These symptoms are initial indicators of the presence of the disease. Each of the associated movement complications typically appear asymmetrically and the symptoms are not observed uniformly throughout the body. For example, a person exhibiting an alien hand syndrome (explained later) in one hand, will not correspondingly display the same symptom in the other hand. Predominant movement disorders and cortical dysfunctions associated with CBD include: * Parkinsonism * Alien hand syndrome * Apraxia (ideomotor apraxia and limb-kinetic apraxia) * Aphasia  Parkinsonism  The presence of parkinsonism as a clinical symptom of CBD is largely responsible for complications in developing unique diagnostic criteria for the disease. Other such diseases in which parkinsonism forms an integral diagnostic characteristic are Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Parkinsonism in CBD is largely present in an extremity such as the arm, and is always asymmetric. It has been suggested that non-dominant arm is involved more often. Common associated movement dysfunctions that comprise parkinsonism are rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disorder, with limb rigidity forming the most typical manifestation of parkinsonism in CBD. Despite being relatively indistinct, this rigidity can lead to disturbances in gait and correlated movements. Bradykinesia in CBD occurs when there is notable slowing in the completion of certain movements in the limbs. In an associated study, it was determined that, three years following first diagnosis, 71% of persons with CBD demonstrate the presence of bradykinesia.  Alien hand syndrome  Alien hand syndrome has been shown to be prevalent in roughly 60% of those people diagnosed with CBD. This disorder involves the failure of an individual to control the movements of their hand, which results from the sensation that the limb is \\"foreign\\". The movements of the alien limb are a reaction to external stimuli and do not occur sporadically or without stimulation. The presence of an alien limb has a distinct appearance in CBD, in which the diagnosed individual may have a \\"tactile mitgehen\\". This mitgehen (German, meaning \\"to go with\\") is relatively specific to CBD, and involves the active following of an experimenter's hand by the subject's hand when both hands are in direct contact. Another, rarer form of alien hand syndrome has been noted in CBD, in which an individual's hand displays an avoidance response to external stimuli. Additionally, sensory impairment, revealed through limb numbness or the sensation of prickling, may also concurrently arise with alien hand syndrome, as both symptoms are indicative of cortical dysfunction. Like most of the movement disorders, alien hand syndrome also presents asymmetrically in those diagnosed with CBD.  Apraxia  Ideomotor apraxia (IMA), although clearly present in CBD, often manifests atypically due to the additional presence of bradykinesia and rigidity in those individuals exhibiting the disorders. The IMA symptom in CBD is characterized by the inability to repeat or mimic particular movements (whether significant or random) both with or without the implementation of objects. This form of IMA is present in the hands and arms, while IMA in the lower extremities may cause problems with walking. Those with CBD that exhibit IMA may appear to have trouble initiating walking, as the foot may appear to be fixed to floor. This can cause stumbling and difficulties in maintaining balance. IMA is associated with deterioration in the premotor cortex, parietal association areas, connecting white matter tracts, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Some individuals with CBD exhibit limb-kinetic apraxia, which involves dysfunction of more fine motor movements often performed by the hands and fingers.  Aphasia  Aphasia in CBD is revealed through the inability to speak or a difficulty in initiating spoken dialogue and falls under the non-fluent (as opposed to fluent or flowing) subtype of the disorder. This may be related to speech impairment such as dysarthria, and thus is not a true aphasia, as aphasia is related to a change in language function, such as difficulty retrieving words or putting words together to form meaningful sentences. The speech and/or language impairments in CBD result in disconnected speech patterns and the omission of words. Individuals with this symptom of CBD often lose the ability to speak as the disease progresses. = Psychiatric and cognitive disorders = Psychiatric problems associated with CBD often present as a result of the debilitating symptoms of the disease. Prominent psychiatric and cognitive conditions cited in individuals with CBD include dementia, depression, and irritability, with dementia forming a key feature that sometimes leads to the misdiagnosis of CBD as another cognitive disorder such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Frontotemporal dementia can be an early feature.  Molecular features  Neuropathological findings associated with CBD include the presence of astrocytic abnormalities within the brain and improper accumulation of the protein tau (referred to as tauopathy). = Astroglial inclusions = Postmortem histological examination of the brains of individuals diagnosed with CBD reveal unique characteristics involving the astrocytes in localized regions. The typical procedure used in the identification of these astroglial inclusions is the Gallyas-Braak staining method. This process involves exposing tissue samples to a silver staining material which marks for abnormalities in the tau protein and astroglial inclusions. Astroglial inclusions in CBD are identified as astrocytic plaques, which present as annularly displays of blurry outgrowths from the astrocyte. A recent study indicated that produces a high density of astrocytic plaques in the anterior portion of the frontal lobe and in the premotor area of the cerebral cortex. = Tauopathy = The protein tau is an important microtubule-associated protein (MAP), and is typically found in neuronal axons. However, malfunctioning of the development of the protein can result in unnatural, high-level expression in astrocytes and glial cells. As a consequence, this is often responsible for the astrocytic plaques prominently noted in histological CBD examinations. Although they are understood to play a significant role in neurodegenerative diseases such as CBD, their precise effect remains a mystery. In recent years Corticobasal Degeneration is seen to be a tauopathy[22]. This is believed due to the most common indicator of CBD being a faulty tau protein. Tau proteins are integral in keeping microtubules stable and these defective cells create 4 microtubule-binding repeats[23]. These 4 binding repeats have increased affinity in binding with microtubules[25]. Because of this increased affinity, they form insoluble fibers (also called \\"paired helical filaments). Microtubules themselves keep the cell and cytoskeletal structure stable[24]. Thus, when Tau proteins create unnatural configurations, microtubules become unstable, and eventually leads to cell death. Diagnosis New diagnostic criteria known as the Armstrong criteria were proposed in 2013, although the accuracy of these is limited and further research is needed. =Criteria= * Insidious onset and gradual progression * Lasts 1 year or more * Meets one of the four subtypes: ** Possible CBS ** FBS or NAV ** PSPS plus at least one CBS feature other than limb rigidity or akinesia * No exclusion criteria present * More likely if onset is after age 50 * More likely if no family history (2 or more relatives) * More likely if no genetic mutation affecting T (e.g., MAPT) Possible corticobasal syndrome subtype Symptoms may be symmetric or asymmetric. One or more of: # limb rigidity or akinesia # limb dystonia # limb myoclonus, plus one of: # orobuccal or limb apraxia # cortical sensory deficit # alien limb phenomena (more than simple levitation) More likely (probable sporadic CBS) if: * Asymmetric presentation * Onset after age 50 * No family history (2 or more relatives) * No genetic mutation affecting T (e.g. MAPT) * plus two of: # limb rigidity or akinesia # limb dystonia # limb myoclonus * plus two of: # orobuccal or limb apraxia, # cortical sensory deficit # alien limb phenomena (more than simple levitation) Frontal behavioural-spatial syndrome subtype Two of: # executive dysfunction # behavioural or personality changes # visuospatial deficits NAV of primary progressive aphasia subtype Effortful, agrammatic speech plus at least one of: # impaired grammar/sentence comprehension with relatively preserved single word comprehension or # groping, distorted speech production (apraxia of speech) Progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome subtype Three of: # axial or symmetric limb rigidity or akinesia # postural instability or falls # urinary incontinence # behavioural changes # supranuclear vertical gaze palsy or decreased vertical saccade velocity  Exclusion criteria  These apply to all types of CBD. * Evidence of Lewy body disease * multiple system atrophy * Alzheimer's disease * ALS * semantic or logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia * structural lesion suggestive of focal cause * granulin mutation or reduced plasma progranulin levels * TDP-43 or fused in sarcoma (FUS) mutations The diagnostic criteria for clinical use may result in a misdiagnosis of other tau-based diseases. The probable criteria are proposed for clinical research. = Clinical vs. postmortem = One of the most significant problems associated with CBD is the inability to perform a definitive diagnosis while an individual exhibiting the symptoms associated with CBD is still alive. A clinical diagnosis of CBD is performed based upon the specified diagnostic criteria, which focus mainly on the symptoms correlated with the disease. However, this often results in complications as these symptoms often overlap with numerous other neurodegenerative diseases. Frequently, a differential diagnosis for CBD is performed, in which other diseases are eliminated based on specific symptoms that do not overlap. However, some of the symptoms of CBD used in this process are rare to the disease, and thus the differential diagnosis cannot always be used. Postmortem diagnosis provides the only true indication of the presence of CBD. Most of these diagnoses utilize the Gallyas-Braak staining method, which is effective in identifying the presence of astroglial inclusions and coincidental tauopathy. = Overlap with other diseases = Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is frequently the disease most often confused with CBD. Both PSP and CBD result in similar symptoms, and both display tauopathies upon histological inspection. However, it has been noted that tauopathy in PSP results in tuft- shaped astrocytes in contrast with the ring-shaped astrocytic plaques found as a result of CBD. Individuals diagnosed with PD often exhibit similar movement dysfunction as those diagnosed with CBD, which adds complexity to its diagnosis. Some other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) also show commonalities with CBD. = Neuroimaging = The types of imaging techniques that are most prominently utilized when studying and/or diagnosing CBD are: * magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) * single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) * fluorodopa positron emission tomography (FDOPA PET) Developments or improvements in imaging techniques provide the future possibility for definitive clinical diagnosis prior to death. However, despite their benefits, information learned from MRI and SPECT during the beginning of CBD progression tend to show no irregularities that would indicate the presence of such a neurodegenerative disease. FDOPA PET is used to study the efficacy of the dopamine pathway. Despite the undoubted presence of cortical atrophy (as determined through MRI and SPECT) in individuals experiencing the symptoms of CBD, this is not an exclusive indicator for the disease. Thus, the utilization of this factor in the diagnosis of CBD should be used only in combination with other clinically present dysfunctions.  MRI  MRI images are useful in displaying atrophied portions of neuroanatomical positions within the brain. As a result, it is especially effective in identifying regions within different areas of the brain that have been negatively affected due to the complications associated with CBD. To be specific, MRI of CBD typically shows posterior parietal and frontal cortical atrophy with unequal representation in corresponding sides. In addition, atrophy has been noted in the corpus callosum. Functional MRI (fMRI) has been used to evaluate the activation patterns in various regions of the brain of individuals affected with CBD. Upon the performance of simple finger motor tasks, subjects with CBD experienced lower levels of activity in the parietal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and supplementary motor cortex than those individuals tested in a control group.  SPECT  SPECT is currently being used to try to detect CBD. With many patients of CBD, there are areas in the basal ganglia which have difficulties receiving dopamine, typically asymmetrically. Specifically affected, are dopamine transporters which are presynaptic on the nigrostriatal cells[21]. SPECT is used to detect these abnormalities in Dopamine transporters. Given that many patients have asymmetrical loss of function and metabolism this can help differentiate patients with CBD and those with Alzheimer's[21]. SPECT studies of individuals diagnosed with CBD involve perfusion analysis throughout the parts of the brain. SPECT evaluation through perfusion observation consists of monitoring blood release into different locations in tissue or organ regions, which, in the case of CBD, pertains to localized areas within the brain. Tissue can be characterized as experiencing overperfusion, underperfusion, hypoperfusion, or hyperperfusion. Overperfusion and underperfusion relate to a comparison with the overall perfusion levels within the entire body, whereas hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion are calculated in comparison to the blood flow requirements of the tissue in question. In general, the measurements taken for CBD using SPECT are referred to as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). In general, SPECT reveals hypoperfusion within both the posterior regions of the frontal and parietal lobes. As in images gathered through MRI, SPECT images indicated asymmetry in the presentation of abnormalities throughout the brain. Additional studies have revealed the presence of perfusion anomalies in the thalamus, temporal cortex, basal ganglia, and pontocerebellar (from the pons to the cerebellum) locations within subjects' brains.  FDOPA PET  Research has suggested that the integrity of the dopamine system in the striatum has been damaged as an effect of CBD. Current studies employing the use of FDOPA PET scanning (FDOPA PET) as a possible method for identifying CBD have focused on analyzing the efficiency of neurons in the striatum that utilize the neurotransmitter dopamine. These studies have concluded that, in general, dopamine uptake was diminished in the caudate and the putamen. This characteristic also has the potential to be useful in distinguishing CBD from the similar PD, as individuals having been diagnosed with PD were more likely to have a lower uptake of dopamine than in individuals with CBD. Other clinical tests or procedures that monitor the presence of dopamine within the brain (Œ≤-CIT SPECT and IBZM SPECT) have shown similar findings. Œ≤-CIT serves as an indicator for presynaptic dopaminergic neurons, whereas IBZM is a tracer that shows an affinity for the postsynaptic neurons of the same type. Despite agreement with other imaging studies, these two SPECT methods suffer some scrutiny due to better accuracy in other imaging methods. However, Œ≤-CIT SPECT has proven to be helpful in distinguishing CBD from PSP and multiple system atrophy (MSA). = Corticobasal syndrome = All of the disorders and dysfunctions associated with CBD can often be categorized into a class of symptoms that present with the disease of CBD. These symptoms that aid in clinical diagnosis are collectively referred to as corticobasal syndrome (CBS) or corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS). Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, FTDP-17 and progressive supranuclear palsy can display a corticobasal syndrome. It has been suggested that the nomenclature of corticobasal degeneration only be used for naming the disease after it has received verification through postmortem analysis of the neuropathology. CBS patients with greater temporoparietal degeneration are more likely to have AD pathology as opposed to frontotemporal lobar degeneration.  Treatment  Because the exact cause of CBD is unknown, there exists no formal treatment for the disease. Instead, treatments focus on minimizing the appearance or effect of the symptoms resulting from CBD. The most easily treatable symptom of CBD is parkinsonism, and the most common form of treatment for this symptom is the application of dopaminergic drugs. However, in general only moderate improvement is seen and the relief from the symptom is not long-lasting. In addition, palliative therapies, including the implementation of wheelchairs, speech therapy, and feeding techniques, are often used to alleviate many of the symptoms that show no improvement with drug administration. There is no consensus on what causes CBD and so most of the treatment goes in helping symptoms. Unfortunately, many treatments are typically low in their success rates or have not been tested thoroughly or produced frequently. For example, in relation to the motor aspect of disability, CBD has a high resistance against treatments to help the dopamine intake like levodopa. A number of studies have reported no real levels of improvement based with the use of similar drugs/dopaminergic agonists. Because of the brains levels of inhibition, some medications have focused on creating an inhibition that would negate the effect. Many of these relaxants and anticonvulsants have some success but also have unwanted side effects[21]. Cognitive and associative effects of CBD are also hard to treat as we are still unsure of many of the treatments for the symptomatic diseases that ensue like dementia, aphasia, neglect, apraxia and others.  Epidemiology  Clinical presentation of CBD usually does not occur until age 60, with the earliest recorded diagnosis and subsequent postmortem verification being age 28. Although men and women present with the disease, some analysis has shown a predominant appearance of CBD in women. Current calculations suggest that the prevalence of CBD is approximately 4.9 to 7.3 per 100,000 people. The prognosis for an individual diagnosed with CBD is death within approximately eight years, although some patients have been diagnosed over 17 years ago (2017) and are still in relatively good standing, but with serious debilitation such as dysphagia, and overall limb rigidity. The partial (or total) use of a feeding tube may be necessary and will help prevent aspiration pneumonia, primary cause of death in CBD. Incontinence is common, as patients often can't express their need to go, due to eventual loss of speech. Therefore, proper hygiene is mandatory to prevent urinary tract infections. CBD research has been limited by the rarity of the disease and the lack of research criteria. It is estimated to affect 0.6-0.9 per 100,000 per year. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) without CBD is estimated to be ten times more common. CBD represents roughly 4‚Äì6% of patients with Parkinsonism. Average age at disease onset is about 64, with the youngest confirmed onset being at age 43. There may be a slight female predominance.  History  Corticobasal syndrome was first recognized in 1967 when Rebeiz, Kolodny, and Richardson Jr described three people with a progressive asymmetric akinetic- rigid syndrome combined with apraxia, which they named corticodentatonigral degeneration with neuronal achromasia. The condition was \\"mostly forgotten\\" until 1989, when Marsden et al. used the name corticobasal degeneration. In 1989 Gibb and colleagues provided detailed clinical and pathological descriptions in a further three cases adopting the name corticobasal degeneration, after which various other names included \\"corticonigral degeneration with nuclear achromasia\\" and \\"cortical basal ganglionic degeneration\\". Although the underlying cause of CBD is unknown, the disease occurs as a result of damage to the basal ganglia, specifically marked by neuronal degeneration or depigmentation (loss of melanin in a neuron) in the substantia nigra. Additional distinguishing neurological features of those diagnosed with CBD consist of asymmetric atrophy of the frontal and parietal cortical regions of the brain. Postmortem studies of patients diagnosed with CBD indicate that histological attributes often involve ballooning of neurons, gliosis, and tauopathy. Much of the pioneering advancements and research performed on CBD has been completed within the past decade or so, due to the relatively recent formal recognition of the disease. The Office of Rare Diseases in the United States created the first criteria in 2002, and the Armstrong clinical diagnostic criteria were created in 2013.  Society and culture  The Salt Path by Raynor Winn is an inspiring account of walking England's 630 mile South West Coast Path with her husband who had corticobasal degeneration.Raynor Winn (2018) The Salt Path, Penguin Books.

The YIMBY position supports increasing the supply of housing within cities where housing costs have escalated to unaffordable levels. YIMBYs often seek rezoning that would allow denser housing to be produced or the repurposing of obsolete buildings, such as malls, into housing. YIMBYs may also support public-interest projects like clean energy or alternative transport. The YIMBY movement has supporters across the political spectrum including left-leaning adherents who believe housing production is a social justice issue and free-market libertarian proponents who think the supply of housing should not be regulated by the government. YIMBYs argue cities can be made increasingly affordable and accessible by building more infill housing, and that greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by denser cities. History A 1993 essay published in the Journal of the American Planning Association entitled \\"Planners' Alchemy, Transforming NIMBY to YIMBY: Rethinking NIMBY\\" used 'YIMBY' in general reference to development, not only housing development. The pro-housing YIMBY position emerged in regions experiencing unaffordable housing prices. The Guardian said this movement began in the San Francisco bay area in the 2010s due to high housing costs created as a result of the local technology industry adding many more jobs to the region than the number of housing units constructed in the same time span. Political debate Equity groups in California have frequently opposed the movement, pointing to its Silicon Valley funding and younger, whiter constituency. At the same time, affordable- housing developers and environmental groups have endorsed YIMBY policies, while suburban homeowners have opposed changes to single-family zoning. YIMBYs advocate for market-rate housing and say this is essential for the viability of its development, which would create housing supply that would lower prices by satisfying demand. Those opposed say adding market-rate housing rather than subsidized and means-tested affordable housing in a high-demand region can worsen housing affordability for low and middle-income earners through the \\"sorting\\" process, whereby high-earning newcomers inhabit the newly built housing. YIMBYs say market-rate development (including luxury development) will eventually result in affordable housing since existing wealthy residents will occupy these new units by vacating less desirable housing in a process called \\"filtering.\\" YIMBYs say their anti-development counterparts obstruct development in defense of the status quo from which they alone benefit. Opponents have described YIMBY organizations as \\"self-interested political calculations\\" by special interests. YIMBYs and their opposition both cite concerns about the environment, quality of life, and social justice as motivating factors. Some journalists have said YIMBY and NIMBY positions are independent of the left‚Äìright political spectrum while scholars have called the NIMBY/YIMBY debate a false dichotomy. Academic research Academic research has yielded some generalizable results on the effects of upzoning, the root causes of unaffordability, and the most efficacious policy prescriptions to help low-income workers in prosperous cities. However, scholars have said more research is necessary to determine the full effects of upzoning and market-rate housing development on affordability for all income levels in prosperous cities. =Inclusionary Zoning= The California Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO) reported that parts of California which built more housing saw slower growth in rents for poor households and that market-rate development is associated with a protective effect against displacement, whereas the presence of an inclusionary-zoning mandate is not. =Housing supply and prices= Studies show that strict land use regulations reduce housing supply and raise the price of houses and land. =Filtering= Upzoning (rezoning for more housing) may not generate immediate housing production and can worsen affordability: a study by Yonah Freemark published in Urban Affairs Review in 2019 found rezoning for denser development near transit stations in Chicago led to a speculative increase in property values and no additional development after a period of five years. In follow-up commentary, Freemark said that the results had been misinterpreted as proof that upzoning will always raise housing prices. He said the study could describe the effects of upzoning, not the effects of new construction enabled by upzoning, and that affordability requirements (inclusionary zoning) could be included with upzoning. Freemark also said the findings of his study, which only looked at Chicago, were not necessarily generalizable to other regions and concluded that his study neither proved nor disproved that increases in housing density improve affordability. Another study published in Urban Studies in 2006 observed price trends within Canadian cities and noted very slow price drops for older housing over a period of decades; the author concluded that newly constructed housing would not become affordable in the near future, meaning that filtering was not a viable method for producing affordable housing, especially in the most expensive cities. =Sorting= In a 2020 Urban Studies article, Michael Storper and Rodriguez-Pose argue \\"that there is no clear and uncontroversial evidence that housing regulation is a principal source of differences in home availability or prices across cities.\\" The article was widely criticized by other scholars who say that Storper and Rodriguez-Pose set up a strawman (that upzoning will eradicate inequality on its own), and that the article \\"ignores much of the research on the topic, misstates or misunderstands the research it does cite, presents misleading and oversimplified analyses, and advances an argument that is internally inconsistent\\". = Racial segregation = Research shows that strict land use regulations contribute to racial housing segregation in the United States. Surveys have shown that white communities are more likely to have strict land use regulations and whites are more likely to support those regulations. = Economy = A 2019 study by Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti in the American Economic Journal found that liberalization of land use regulations would lead to enormous productivity gains. The study estimated that strict land use regulations \\"lowered aggregate US growth by 36 percent from 1964 to 2009.\\"  Examples  = Canada = In Toronto, Canada, a self-styled YIMBY movement was established in 2006 by community members in response to significant development proposals in the West Queen West area, and a YIMBY festival, launched the same year, has been held annually since. The festival's organizer stated that \\"YIMBYism is a community mindset that's open to change and development.\\" = Sweden = Yimby is an independent political party network founded in Stockholm in 2007, which advocates physical development, densification and promotion of urban environment with chapters in Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Uppsala. The group believes that the PBL (Plans and Constructions Act, from 1987) is a major impediment to any new construction, and should be eliminated or dramatically reformed. = United Kingdom = London YIMBY was set up in 2016, publishing its first report with the Adam Smith Institute in 2017 which received national press coverage. Its members advocate a policy termed 'Better Streets'. This proposal would allow residents of individual streets to vote by a two-thirds majority to pick a design code and allow extensions or replacement buildings of up to five or six stories, allowing suburban homes to be gradually replaced by mansion blocks. This flagship policy has achieved a degree of recognition, being endorsed by former Liberal Democrat MP Sam Gyimah and the leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg. Other YIMBY groups have been set up in individual London boroughs and in cities suffering similar housing shortages, such as Brighton, Bristol and Edinburgh. Members of the British YIMBY movement have been critical of established planning organisations such as the Town and Country Planning Association and the Campaign to Protect Rural England, accusing them of pursuing policies that worsen Britain's housing shortage. = United States = California Since 2014, in response to California's housing affordability crisis, several YIMBY groups were created in the San Francisco Bay Area. These groups have lobbied both locally and at the state level for increased housing production at all price levels, as well as using California's Housing Accountability Act (the \\"anti-NIMBY law\\") to sue cities when they attempt to block or downsize housing development. The New York Times explained about one organization: \\"Members want San Francisco and its suburbs to build more of every kind of housing. More subsidized affordable housing, more market-rate rentals, more high-end condominiums.\\" From 2018 to 2020, the lobbying group California YIMBY joined over 100 Bay Area technology industry executives in supporting state senator Scott Wiener's Senate Bills 827 and 50. The bills failed in the state senate after multiple attempts at passage. California YIMBY received $100,000 from Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman, $1 million from Irish entrepreneurs John and Patrick Collison through their company, Stripe, and $500,000 raised by Pantheon CEO Zach Rosen and GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. YIMBY groups in California have supported the split roll effort to eliminate Proposition 13 protections for commercial properties, and are supporting the ballot measure known as Proposition 15, which would implement this change. This change could incentivize local governments to approve commercial property development (for its attendant business, payroll, sales and property tax revenue) over residential development and would not provide funding earmarked for affordable housing development. Massachusetts Since 2012, several YIMBY groups were established in the greater Boston area. One group argues that \\"...more smart housing development is the only way to retain a middle class in pricey cities like Boston and Cambridge.\\" New York In 2011, a YIMBY news website was created that focuses on construction trends in New York City. In an interview with Politico, the creator stated: \\"Zoning is the problem, not development in this city. I think people don't really understand that.\\" Several YIMBY groups have also been created in New York City; according to an organizer: \\"In high-opportunity areas where people actually really want to live, the well-heeled, mostly white residents are able to use their perceived political power to stop the construction of basically anything,\\" adding that low-income communities don't share that ability to keep development at bay: \\"Philosophically, we think that the disproportionate share of the burden of growth has been borne by low income, minority or industrial neighborhoods for far too long.\\" = International = In September 2018, the third annual Yes In My Backyard conference, named \\"YIMBYTown\\" occurred in Boston, hosted by that area's YIMBY community. The first YIMBY conference was held in 2016 in Boulder, Colorado and hosted by a group that included Boulder's former mayor, who commented that: \\"It is clearer than ever that if we really care about solving big national issues like inequality and climate change, tackling the lack of housing in thriving urban areas, caused largely by local zoning restrictions, is key.\\" The second annual conference was held in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Oakland, California. These conferences have attracted attendees from the United States, as well as some from Canada, England, Australia, and other countries.

He represented District 7 on the City Council there from 1961 to 1993, making him the second-longest-serving council member in the history of the city. He was also the musical arranger for two of the mid-20th century's most popular dance melodies. Bernardi in 1974 Biography Bernardi was born on October 29, 1911Los Angeles Public Library reference file above a grocery store his family owned in Standard, Illinois, the son of musician Alfonso Bernardi and Nerina Biagini. His parents were immigrants who came to America by way of Ellis Island, from a small town in the province of Modena in the Emilia Romagna. His mother died in childbirth, and he was raised by his father, two grandmothers, an aunt and an uncle. When he was eleven, he was moved to the nearby town of Toluca, Illinois, where he later played varsity basketball.Richard Simon, \\"Bernardi's Iconoclasm Brings Acclaim, Enmity,\\" Los Angeles Times, San Fernando Valley edition, April 3, 1989Rick Orlov, \\"Valley's Ardent Fighter, 94, Dies,\\" Los Angeles Daily News\\", Political-Graveyard; accessed February 15, 2018. Bernardi attended the University of Detroit, where he planned to study journalism and become a sportscaster. He was playing saxophone in a dance band at Detroit's Graystone Ballroom when he met Lucille May Sawasky of Port Arthur, Ontario. They were married in 1933 and lived in Detroit briefly before moving to New York. The couple had four children, Joanne Marie Roots, Judith Ann, John Paul and (Ernani) James. They settled in Los Angeles in 1939 or 1940, and Bernardi began his second career as a contractor, building custom homes. After their children were grown, Lucille Bernardi went to work in the county probation department as a records clerk. When older, she suffered from Alzheimer's disease, and Bernardi, by then a City Council member, would bring her to work with him from their home in Van Nuys to watch television in his office.Jack Cheevers, \\"Lucille Bernardi Dies\\", Los Angeles Times, October 13, 1993. She died in 1993. Ernani Bernardi remarried in November 2001 to Eve Troutman.\\"Former Councilman Gets Hospital Tests\\", Los Angeles Times, December 20, 2011. Bernardi was described at age 74 in 1985 as \\"crusty, . . . short, bald and bespectacled,\\" and four years later he was said to have \\"a puckish sense of humor.\\" As he aged, his hearing deteriorated, and he wore special headphones at council meetings so he could hear what was going on.Richard Simon, \\"Bernardi Continues His Long Solo in City Politics,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 22, 1993 Even at age 86, he had \\"a booming voice and aggressive style.\\" He died of heart failure at the age of 94 on January 4, 2006. Music Bernardi's father, Alfonso, was a music teacher who taught his son how to play the saxophone. Ernani went on to become a musician, performing under the pseudonym Noni Bernardi as lead alto sax for several of big bands of the era such as those of Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey and Kay Kyser. He was known for his arrangements of Goodman's \\"And the Angels Sing\\" and Dorsey's \\"I'm Getting Sentimental Over You.\\"Richard Simon, \\"Bernardi Feted for 25 Years as City 'Naysayer,' \\" Los Angeles Times, May 31, 1986, page 6 Bernardi moved to California in 1940 to perform with Kay Kyser's Kollege of Musical Knowledge. His musical prowess was acknowledged in 1994, when at age 82 he was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ironically, as the Los Angeles Times pointed out, his star‚Äîand those of 29 other musicians and actors‚Äîwas funded by the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, an organization that Bernardi had been fighting with for years. The tribute is in the 7000 block of Hollywood Boulevard.Hugo Martin, \\"Turning the Tables,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 26, 1994 The ex-councilman continued playing the sax well into his eighties. In 2000 he was a regular at age 88 with his band booked, among other places, at a retro big band restaurant called Leon's Steak House in North Hollywood.

By 1957 a contractor in the San Fernando Valley, Bernardi ran for the Los Angeles City Council District 7 seat that year but finished third in the primary election, after James C. Corman, the eventual victor, and Kay Bogendorfer. When Corman was elected to Congress, Bernardi ran again in 1961 and was elected. He served eight terms until retiring in 1993. In 1961, District 7 covered Van Nuys, Sepulveda, Granada Hills and Sylmar,Carlton Williams, \\"12 Vie for 7th District Council Post,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 21, 1961 and in 1986 it covered Panorama City, part of Sun Valley and Sylmar.\\"Los Angeles' Realigned Council Districts,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 21, 1986, page B -3 For most of his early terms in office, Bernardi represented a \\"predominantly white working-class district in the mid- San Fernando Valley.\\" His backers included many Valley tax opponents who were behind the successful passage of California's Proposition 13 anti-tax measure. In 1986, a 12-vote majority of the City Council moved Bernardi's 7th District to a \\"largely new\\" part of the Valley for him, the northeast area, which contained more minorities than his former territory. One \\"City Hall lobbyist\\" opined that the measure in some way was a payback for Bernardi's public criticism of his colleagues. Yet he was reelected in 1989 by 55% to 45% over Fire Captain Lyle Hall, \\"who had more money, a more sophisticated mail campaign and labor unions' support that translated into scores of ready volunteers.\\" Bernardi also picked up support from Latino leaders in his new district.Amy Pyle and Stephanie Chavez, \\"Bernardi Win Is for Little People, His Backers Say,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 8, 1989 By the time Bernardi retired in 1993, the 7th District was 70 percent Latino and 19 percent African- American, encompassing one of Los Angeles's poorest areas.Jack Cheevers, \\"Elections: The Head of a Pacoima Youth Group Joins a Growing Field . . .,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 27, 1993 Registered voters were 39 percent Anglo, 30 percent Latino and 19 percent African-American.Scott Harris, \\"Last Press Release of the Anti-Politician,\\" Los Angeles Times, July 4, 1993 His tenure of 32 years has been surpassed only by the 35 years of Council Member John Ferraro. =Highlights= Bernardi was nicknamed \\"Mr. No\\" because of his opposition to city spending,John Schwada, \\"Bernardi Announces Bid for Mayor,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 15, 1993 and he was known as the City Council's \\"gadfly\\" because of his \\"pesky pursuit of lost causes,\\" but in 1985 he was successful in forcing the City Council to put a tough campaign-reform law on the April ballot after he circulated petitions that would have required a vote on an even tougher law. He did this by \\"enlisting the support of the League of Women Voters and a ragtag group made up mostly of retirees to qualify an initiative for the ballot.\\" Bernardi listed his campaign-reform success as among his most satisfying achievements, as well as an ordinance requiring all residential developments of five or more units to set aside at least 15 percent of the units for low and moderate-income families. He also supported rent control. He led successful campaigns for city charter amendments that limited police and firefighter pensions and that did away with a requirement that the city pay comparable wages to those of private industry. \\"I think he reflects a philosophy of misery\\" because of his efforts to cut allocations for human services, fellow Councilman David S. Cunningham, Jr. said.Richard Simon, \\"Council's Gadfly Relentlessly Pursues Lost Causes But Reform Measure Gives Him His Day in the Sun,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 17, 1985, page 1 The Los Angeles Times added: > Yet, there is a compassionate side to Bernardi.

He was seen as a \\"loner\\" on the 15-member City Council, lacking the spirit of compromise, thus limiting his political effect, yet longtime council president John S. Gibson, Jr. praised him for probably saving the city \\"millions of dollars over the years with his questioning.\\" In a ceremony marking his 25th anniversary on the council, he was presented with the \\"no\\" voting button from his desk, \\"which Councilman John Ferraro quipped was 'worn out' from overuse.\\" In 1987 he voted against supporting a Los Angeles Festival of Arts with money and services because it was \\"chintzy\\" for a $5.8 million festival to ask for help. He was joined by Council Members Gloria Molina and Nate Holden, who said not enough minority artists were represented.\\"Morning Report,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 27, 1987, page G-2 In 1988 Bernardi provided $70,000 from his $641,978-a-year office budget for police task forces to combat burglaries and drug trafficking in his district, and, even though he supported a lobbying group called FAIR, \\"devoted to using the harshest possible measures to reduce illegal immigration,\\"Bruce Kelley, \\"El Mosco,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 18, 1990 he helped establish a hiring hall to get immigrant workers off the street. Critics claimed that \\"as an aging white man,\\" he lacked \\"modern-day sensitivity\\" when, in August 1989, he called African-American Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas \\"Curly\\" during an \\"emotionally charged discussion of racism.\\" Ridley-Thomas rebuked Bernardi for the \\"condescending and racist\\" remark, and Bernardi apologized. In his last years on the council, he continued casting \\"no\\" votes: against building the Metro Rail subway, against establishing a downtown redevelopment project, against declaring Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a city holiday. He said he didn't mind recognizing the civil rights leader, but did not want to give city workers another day off. One of his final campaigns was against the practice of the City Council drawing its own district boundaries. He urged that instead the boundaries should be set by a special commission of retired Municipal Court judges. In a related comment, on his last day in office he issued a press release applauding the U.S. Supreme Court in its Shaw v. Reno decision invalidating the drawing of a serpentine- shaped Congressional district whose parts seemed to have nothing to do with each other than the fact they were inhabited mostly by black people. Campaign for mayor Bernardi ran for mayor of Los Angeles while he was in his last few months on the City Council in 1993, saying that the other candidates failed to address issues that were important to him‚Äîmostly slashing the size and cost of government. He ran a low-budget, no-frills campaign, and in the end received just 1 percent of the citywide vote.Jack Cheevers, \\"Bernardi Endorses Ex-Foe Hall,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 29, 1993 Post- council In 1994 Bernardi sued the city of Los Angeles and its redevelopment agency, alleging that the agency violated the state's open meetings law when it was considering plans for Downtown Los Angeles.Julie Tamaki, \\"Bernardi Suit Against City Is Dismissed,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 13, 1994 He helped finance the costs of his lawsuit by selling a videocassette of several big bands performing his favorite tunes.Hugo Martin, \\"Legal Bills,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 15, 1995 Eventually, appellate courts and the state supreme court ruled in favor of Bernardi in the main thrust of his claim, which effectively set a cap on the amount of money the agency could spend on the project.Eric Malnic, \\"Bernardi Wins Round Against CRA,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 26, 1996\\"Appeals Court Affirms CRA Spending Cap,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 21, 1997 In the 1990s he spoke against the idea of establishing neighborhood councils as part of a proposed city charter reform process.Efrain Hernandez Jr., Los Angeles Times, March 13, 1998 In 1999, City Council President John Ferraro appointed Bernardi to a committee to oversee the spending of $744 million in bond funds for police and fire stations.Patrick McGreevey, \\"Bernardi Is Top Choice to Oversee Bond Funds,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 10, 1999 References Access to some Los Angeles Times links may require the use of a library card.''

She is the primary figure of the Japanese new religion Tenrikyo. Followers, who refer to her as Oyasama („Åä„ÇÑ„Åï„Åæ), believe that she was settled as the Shrine of Tsukihi from the moment she experienced a divine revelation in 1838 until her death in 1887. Upon her divine revelation, she gave away most of her family's possessions and dismantled the family's house, thereby entering a state of poverty. She began to attract followers, who believed that she was a living goddess who could heal people and bless expectant mothers with safe childbirth. To leave a record of her teachings, she composed the Ofudesaki and taught the lyrics, choreography and music of the Service, which have become Tenrikyo's scripture and liturgy respectively. She identified what she claimed to be the place where God created human beings and instructed her followers to mark the place with a pillar and perform the liturgy around it, which she believed would advance humankind toward the salvific state of the Joyous Life. In the last several years of her life, she and her followers were arrested and detained a number of times by the Japanese authorities for forming a religious group without official authorization. A year after her death, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters received official authorization to be a church under the Shinto Main Bureau. Tenrikyo doctrine maintains that Nakayama Miki was the fulfillment of God's promise to humankind at creation, which was that after a certain number of years had elapsed, God would be revealed through the soul of the mother of humankind at the place of creation and inform humankind of its origins, purpose, and means of salvation. Doctrine also maintains that as the Shrine of God, Nakayama's words and actions were in complete accordance with the divine will and that upon her death, her soul withdrew from physical existence and became everliving. Biography =Childhood= Nakayama Miki, n√©e Maegawa, was born on 18 April 1798 (2 June) at dawn, around five o'clock in the morning. She was born in Sanmaiden Village, Yamabe County, Yamato Province, or present day Tenri, Nara, to a family of the farming class. Her father Maegawa Hanshichi was a member of the T≈çd≈ç clan and held the title of musokunin, a samurai-like status which entitled him to have a surname and carry a sword, though without stipend. He was also an ojoya, a head of a group of local villages. Her mother, Kinu, was from the Nagao family of the same village and was said to have excelled in needlework. In the first decade of her life, Miki learned how to write with a brush from her father and how to sew and spin cotton from her mother. From the ages of nine to eleven, she attended a private school for children at a nearby village, where she was educated in reading and writing. At home, she learned needlework from her mother and became proficient enough to make handicraft items and to cut garments out of wide bolts of cotton. The Maegawas were pious adherents of the Pure Land school of Buddhism and belonged to a local temple. In her childhood, Miki became familiar enough with Buddhist prayer so that by the age of twelve or thirteen, she was able to recite from memory various sutras as well the hymns from the J≈çdo Wasan. At that time, she expressed an interest in becoming a nun. However, Miki's parents, on the suggestion of Miki's aunt, Kinu, asked her to marry Nakayama Zenbei, the son of Miki's aunt. At first, Miki hesitated to agree to the request out of her desire to become a nun, but eventually she consented, on the condition that even when married she would be allowed to continue her Buddhist prayer. =Marriage= On 15 September 1810 (13 October), Miki took part in her bridal procession to the residence of the Nakayama family in the village of Shoyashiki. Dressed in a long-sleeved kimono, she was carried in a palanquin and was accompanied by attendants carrying a trousseau of five loads ‚Äì two chests of drawers, two long chests, and a pair of boxes. The Nakayama family, like the Maegawa family, held some prestige in the local area. The custom in Shoyashiki was for the male head of the Nakayama household to inherit the post of toshiyori (village head), and in Miki's lifetime, her father-in-law Zenyemon, and later, her husband Zenbei served as toshiyori. In addition, the Nakayama family was a major landholder in the village. In 1813, Miki's in-laws entrusted her with the management of all household affairs. The Life of Oyasama, Tenrikyo's biography of Miki, portrays her as a diligent and productive worker. According to its account she did every type of farm work except for the men's tasks of digging ditches and plowing rice fields, pulled more than half an acre of cotton a day, and wove fabrics twice as fast as the average woman. In the spring of 1816, she completed a training course known as the Fivefold Transmission at Zenpuku Temple, her parish temple in Magata Village (now a district of the city of Tenri). During the Fivefold Transmission, she attended lectures on the writings of H≈çnen, meditated, underwent tonsure, and made a vow to repeat the nenbutsu for the remainder of her life. Those who enrolled in the Fivefold Transmission were initiated into the mysteries of the Pure Land sect and were considered to have reached the highest level of faith. In June 1820, Nakayama Zenyemon, Miki's father-in-law, died at the age of sixty-two. In July 1821, Miki's first child, also named Zenyemon (later renamed Shuji) was born. Her first daughter Omasa and second daughter Oyasu were born in April 1825 and September 1827 respectively. In April 1828, Miki's mother-in-law Kinu, died. The anecdotes from The Life of Oyasama depict Miki as a charitable and forgiving mother. When a man was caught stealing a bag of rice from the Nakayama family's storehouse, Miki allowed him to keep the rice instead of turning him in to the authorities. When the mothers in her village suffered from a lack of milk, she would offer to nurse their infants. In 1828, one of the infants she was nursing, a boy named Adachi Terunojo, contracted smallpox. To pray for his recovery, she underwent a hundred-day prayer, walking barefoot to the village shrine every day. In 1830, Miki's second daughter Oyasu died. Her third daughter, Oharu, was born on 21 September 1831. Her fourth daughter, Otsune, was born on 7 November 1833 and died two years later in 1835. Her fifth daughter, Kokan, was born on 15 December 1837. =Revelation= On 26 October 1837, Nakayama Miki's eldest son, Sh≈´ji, felt an acute pain in his leg while sowing barley in the fields. A village doctor named Gensuke was summoned to treat the leg. When Sh≈´ji's condition did not improve, the family called for Nakatano Ichibei, a shugenja (ascetic monk) who was renowned in the area for his healing rituals. Ichibei offered prayers on three occasions, but after each time Sh≈´ji had only temporary relief before the pain returned. After Zenbei, Miki's husband, made another entreaty to Ichibei, he agreed to conduct an incantation (yosekaji), a ritual intended to invoke the Buddha's compassion. Over the course of a year, the incantation was conducted nine times. When Miki and Zenbei had sudden physical pains on the evening of 23 October 1838, Zenbei sent a messenger to Ichibei, who on that day was visiting his relatives in Shoyashiki for a local festival. Ichibei held another incantation the following morning. However, as the woman who regularly served as his medium, Soyo, was not available, he asked Miki to serve as medium instead. In the middle of the incantation, Tenrikyo's doctrine asserts that Miki had her first divine revelation. After the first revelation, Miki remained in a trance while the Nakayama family discussed how to respond to the request. Over three days, the family made several refusals, asking the divine presence to leave, but with each refusal Miki's trance grew in intensity and her responses became more severe. Then, at eight o'clock on the morning on 26 October 1838, Miki's husband Zenbei accepted the invitation on the family's behalf and her trance stopped. On this day, according to Tenrikyo's doctrine, Nakayama Miki was settled as the Shrine of Tsukihi and the Tenrikyo teachings were founded. =Poverty and ministry= Depiction of Nakayama Kokan spreading the divine name Tenri-O-no-Mikoto (Â§©ÁêÜÁéãÂëΩ) in Osaka. For the three years or so following the revelation, Miki secluded herself in a storehouse. In the 1840s, Miki gradually gave away her personal belongings and the possessions of the Nakayama family. Then Miki requested that her husband Zenbei dismantle the main house, starting with the roof tiles at the southeast corner followed by the tiles on the northeast corner and the gable walls. In 1848, she began to give sewing lessons at her home, and in 1852 her daughter Oharu was married to Kajimoto Sojiro, the younger brother of one of the sewing students. Around this time, her son Sh≈´ji opened a classroom at home and began to instruct the village children in reading and writing. On 22 February 1853, Miki's husband Zenbei died. In the same year, the dismantling of the Nakayama house was completed, and Miki sent her youngest daughter Kokan to Naniwa (in present day Osaka) to chant the divine name, thus marking the first instance of missionary work in the Tenrikyo tradition. In 1854, Miki began to administer the grant of safe childbirth (obiya-yurushi), first to her daughter Oharu during her pregnancy. After Oharu delivered the baby safely, expectant mothers who had heard about the grant visited the Nakayama residence and requested that the grant be administered to them as well. The grant, a form of faith healing, was conducted by stroking and breathing on the recipient's stomach three times. Recipients of the grant, Miki instructed, would be assured of a rapid and easy delivery and would not need to observe the postnatal customs of the day, such as wearing an abdominal band, not eating certain foods, or leaning against a support. =Scripture and liturgy= A song book of the Mikagura-uta. In 1864, Iburi Iz≈ç, a carpenter and a close disciple of Oyasama, constructed Tenrikyo's first house of worship, the Place for the Service (tsutome no basho). From 1866 to 1875, Miki taught the Mikagura-uta, the songs of Tenrikyo's liturgy, the Service. The Mikagura-uta is divided into five sections; sections one, two and three are performed seated with hand movements while sections four and five are dances. Section one was composed first, in 1866, followed by section five from January to August 1867. In 1870, sections two and four were composed, followed by section three in 1875. From 1869 to 1882, Miki composed what would later be called the Ofudesaki, a Tenrikyo scripture believed to contain her divine revelations. The Ofudesaki was written in the hiragana script and in the waka style of Japanese poetry, and has since been compiled into 1,711 verses divided into seventeen parts. In 1874, Miki collected the kagura masks she had requested from her older brother Maegawa Kyosuke. The kagura masks would be used for the Kagura Service, a subset of the Service. On 26 May 1875 (29 June), Miki located the Jiba, where she claimed was the spot where God created human beings. According to The Life of Oyasama, she identified the spot by walking randomly around the yard of her residence until her foot stopped. To confirm, she asked the other followers who were present to walk around blindfolded and their feet stopped at the same spot. She instructed her followers to mark this spot with a stand called the Kanrodai, or the stand of heavenly dew. Later that year, a wooden prototype of the Kanrodai, built by Iburi Iz≈ç two years earlier on Miki's request, was brought out of the storehouse of the Nakayama residence and placed on the Jiba. In 1877, Miki taught the women's instruments to be used in the liturgy ‚Äì shamisen, koky≈´, and koto. On 26 August 1880 (30 September), the liturgy was performed for the first time with the full set of instruments. In 1881, the construction of a stone version of the Kanrodai commenced with a search for stones in a nearby village. In May and September of the same year, the first and second layers of the stand, respectively, were put into place. However, in March 1882, the chief of the Nara police station confiscated the two layers, a measure taken to prevent the performance of the Service the next day. In the same year, Miki expressed her regret over the confiscation in the final verses of the Ofudesaki, completed that year, and made revisions to sections one and three of the Mikagura-uta. =Persecution= An early instance of persecution occurred in 1866, when several yamabushi monks caused a disturbance at Miki's residence and filed a complaint to the local magistrate's office regarding the activities taking place there. The magistrate's office questioned Miki and her followers and advised them to obtain government authorization first before continuing their activities. Miki's son Sh≈´ji went to the Yoshida Administrative Office of Shinto in Kyoto and received government authorization in 1867. However, the authorization became invalid in 1870 when the Yoshida Administrative Office was terminated by the recently installed Meiji government. In 1876, Miki's son Sh≈´ji obtained a license to operate a steam bath and inn as a pretense to allow more followers to gather without arousing suspicion from the police. =Death= The Life of Oyasama The Life of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo is the biography of Nakayama Miki published by Tenrikyo Church Headquarters. =Background= Efforts to compile a biography of Nakayama Miki began not long after her death in 1887. An instruction recorded in the Osashizu, dated 13 October 1890, requested that the followers produce a record of Nakayama's life.Nakayama, Shozen. \\"The Doctrine and Practice of Tenrikyo.\\" The Theological Persepctives of Tenrikyo: In Commemoration of the Centennial Anniversary of Oyasama. ed. Oyasato Research Institute, Tenri University. Tenri, Japan. 1986. p.9. In response to this request, Nakayama Shinnosuke, the first Shinbashira, supervised the composition of the script for the Besseki lectures, which was completed in 1896. Based on this script, Nakayama Shinnosuke wrote a biography dated 3 July 1898 (referred to as the katakana version) and another one around 1907 (the hiragana version). Nakayama Shinnosuke's hiragana version became the basis of future biography compilations including The Life of Oyasama.Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion (1997). Ky≈çsoden hensan shi [Compilation history of the Foundress' biography]. In Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten. (pp. 279-280). Tenri, Japan: Tenriky≈ç D≈çy≈´sha. Besides Nakayama Shinnosuke's writings, a number of other writings containing biographical information were produced by various individuals. When the Tenrikyo followers made a written request in December 1886 to establish a church, four early Tenrikyo leaders ‚Äì K≈çda Ch≈´sabur≈ç, Shimizu Yonosuke, Moroi Kunisabur≈ç, and Masuno Sh≈çbei ‚Äì submitted Saisho no yurai (ÊúÄÂàù‰πãÁî±Êù•) along with the request. In 1891, Hashimoto Kiyoshi wrote Tenriky≈çkai yurai ryakki (Â§©ÁêÜÊïô‰ºöÁî±Êù•Áï•Ë®ò), which was written to be submitted to groups outside the church. During the church's efforts to obtain sectarian independence at the turn of the century, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters commissioned biographies from non-Tenrikyo writers, Udagawa Bunkai in 1900 and Nakanishi Ushir≈ç in 1902. Around this time Tenrikyo followers such as Okutani Bunchi and Masuno Michioki independently wrote biographies as well. In 1925, the Department of Doctrine and Historical Materials was founded. The department gathered historical materials and produced \\"The Life of Oyasama; with Revised Historical Data\\" (Âæ°ÊïôÁ•ñ‰ºùÂè≤ÂÆüÊ†°Ë®ÇÊú¨) around 1936.The Theological Persepctives of Tenrikyo: In Commemoration of the Centennial Anniversary of Oyasama. p.9.Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion (1997).

This was later published in volumes 29, 30, 32, 37, and 47 of the journal Fukugen (Âæ©ÂÖÉ). =Compilation= In 1952, a group of scholars of Tenrikyo Church Headquarters known as the \\"K≈çki Committee\\" began to prepare a number of drafts of Oyasama's biography. In so doing, they decided to use the research of Nakayama Shinnosuke as the primary historical reference. The first draft was put together by an early Tenrikyo theologian, Ueda Yoshinaru, in the same year.

The name means \\"of irreproachable valor\\". Before the battle, both the Greek and Persian armies camped in front of each other for 10 days on the plain of Plateaea, with only small raids on each side. However, the Persians diverted the Greek water supply and cut off their supply of food, so the Greeks were forced to find a new camp. The plan was for the main contingent of Greeks to set out first during the night, with the Spartans guarding the rear. After the main contingent of Greeks had left the encampment, and it was time for the Spartans to set off to take up the rear, Amompharetus refused to leave the field without a fight, insisting that the unalterable law of Sparta forbade retreat from the battlefield. It took some convincing and rank-pulling on behalf of the Spartan regent, Pausanias, and a not inconsiderable amount of time, to compel Amompharetus and his unit to follow the maneuvering of the rest of the army. On discovering the Greeks had abandoned their positions and their Spartan allies, the leader of the Persian forces, Mardonius, launched an attack in haste. The Persian offensive was in disarray before battle was joined, and Mardonius soon lay dead and the Persian army crushed. There is another mention of Amompharetus (in Plutarch's Solon) as one of the five Spartans arbitrating the dispute over the island of Salamis between the citizens of Athens and Megara.

The first streetcars in Washington, D.C., were drawn by horses and carried people short distances on flat terrain; but the introduction of cleaner and faster electric streetcars, capable of climbing steeper inclines, opened up the hilly suburbs north of the old city and in Anacostia. Several of the district's streetcar lines were extended into Maryland, and two Virginia lines crossed into the district. The city experimented briefly with cable cars, but by the beginning of the 20th century, the streetcar system was fully electrified. By 1901, a series of mergers dubbed the \\"Great Streetcar Consolidation\\" gathered most local transit firms into two major companies. In 1933, a second consolidation brought all streetcars under one company, Capital Transit. Over the next decades, the streetcar system shrank amid the rising popularity of the automobile and pressure to switch to buses. After a strike in 1955, the company changed ownership and became DC Transit, with explicit instructions to switch to buses. The system was dismantled in the early 1960s; the last streetcar ran on January 28, 1962. Today, some streetcars, car barns, trackage, stations, and rights-of-way exist in various states of usage. Tracks are still visible on the 3200, 3300, and 3400 blocks of O St NW and P St NW. History =Early transit in Washington= Public transportation began in Washington, D.C., almost as soon as the city was founded. In May 1800, two- horse stage coaches began running twice daily from Bridge and High Streets NW (now Wisconsin Avenue and M Street NW) in Georgetown by way of M Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW/SE to William Tunnicliff's Tavern at the site now occupied by the Supreme Court Building. Service ended soon after it began. At Google Books. The next attempt at public transit arrived in the spring of 1830, when Gilbert Vanderwerken's Omnibuses, horse-drawn wagons, began running from Georgetown to the Navy Yard. The company maintained stables on M Street, NW. These lines were later extended down 11th Street SE to the waterfront and up 7th Street NW to L Street NW. Vanderwerken's success attracted competitors, who added new lines, but by 1854, all omnibuses had come under the control of two companies, \\"The Union Line\\" and \\"The Citizen's Line.\\" In 1860, these two merged under the control of Vanderwerken and continued to operate until they were run out of business by the next new technology: streetcars. =Horse- drawn streetcars= Washington and Georgetown Horsecars on Pennsylvania Avenue NW Streetcars began operation in New York City along the Bowery in 1832, but the technology did not really become popular until 1852, when Alphonse Loubat invented a side-bearing rail that could be laid flush with the street surface, allowing the first horse-drawn streetcar lines. The technology began to spread and on May 17, 1862, the first Washington, D.C., streetcar company, the Washington and Georgetown Railroad was incorporated. The company ran the first streetcar in Washington, D.C., from the Capitol to the State Department starting on July 29, 1862. It expanded to full operations from the Navy Yard to Georgetown on October 2, 1862. Another line opened on November 15, 1862. It was built along 7th Street NW from N Street NW to the Potomac River and expanded to the Arsenal (now Fort McNair) in 1875. A third line ran down 14th Street NW from Boundary Street NW (now Florida Avenue) to the Treasury Building. In 1863 the 7th Street line was extended north to Boundary Street NW. Metropolitan The Washington and Georgetown's monopoly didn't last long. On July 1, 1864, a second streetcar company, the Metropolitan Railroad, was incorporated. It opened lines from the Capitol to the War Department along H Street NW. In 1872, it built a line on 9th Street NW and purchased the Union Railroad (chartered on January 19, 1872). It used the Union's charter to expand into Georgetown. In 1873 it purchased the Boundary and Silver Spring Railway (chartered on January 19, 1872) and used its charter to build north on what is now Georgia Avenue. In June 1874, it absorbed the Connecticut Avenue and Park Railway (chartered on July 13, 1868; operations started in April 1873) and its line on Connecticut Avenue from the White House to Boundary Avenue. By 1888, it had built additional lines down 4th Street NW/SW to P Street SW, and on East Capitol Street to 9th Street. Columbia Chartered by Congress on May 24, 1870 and beginning operations the same year, the Columbia Railway was the city's third horse car operator. It ran from the Treasury Building along H Street NW/NE to the city boundary at 15th Street NE. The company built a car barn and stable on the east side of 15th Street just south of H Street at the eastern end of the line. Anacostia and Potomac River The Anacostia and Potomac River Railroad was chartered on May 5, 1870. It wasn't given approval by Congress until February 18, 1875, but it was constructed that year. The streetcars traveled from the Arsenal and crossed the Navy Yard Bridge to Uniontown (now Historic Anacostia) to Nichols Avenue SE (now Martin Luther King Avenue) and V Street SE where a car barn and stables were maintained by the company. In 1888 the Anacostia and Potomac River expanded from the Navy Yard to Congressional Cemetery, and past Garfield Park to the Center Market (now the National Archives) in downtown. It also expanded up Nichols Avenue past the Government Hospital for the Insane (now St. Elizabeths Hospital). Capitol, North O Street and South Washington Map of the Washington, D.C. Streetcar System at the end of the Horse Car era in 1888The last streetcar company to begin operation during the horsecar era was the Capitol, North O Street and South Washington Railway. It was incorporated on March 3, 1875, and began operation later that year. It ran on a circular route around downtown D.C. A P Street NW track was added in 1876. In 1881, the route was extended north and south on 11th Street West and tracks were rerouted across the Mall. It changed its name to the Belt Railway on February 18, 1893. Horse-drawn chariots and the Herdic Phaeton Company During this time, streetcars competed with numerous horse-drawn chariot companies. Starting on March 5, 1877, the date of President Hayes' inauguration, single-horse carriages began running on a route roughly parallel to the Washington and Georgetown's Pennsylvania Avenue route. After three years, streetcars forced the chariots out of business. This was followed almost immediately by the Herdic Phaeton Company. The electric streetcar, however, was too much for the company to compete with and when its principal stockholder died in 1896, it ceased operations. After the Herdic Company went under, the Metropolitan Coach Company began running horse-drawn coaches in conjunction with the Metropolitan Railroad, carrying passengers from 16th and T Streets NW to 22nd and G Streets NW. It began operations on May 1, 1897, with a car barn at 1914 E Street NW. In 1904, it became its own corporation. =The switch to electric power= Horsecars, though an improvement over horse drawn wagons, were slow, dirty and inefficient. Horses needed to be housed and fed, created large amounts of waste, had difficulty climbing hills and were difficult to dispose of. Almost as soon as they were instituted, companies began looking for alternatives. For example, the Washington and Georgetown experimented with a steam motor car in the 1870s and 1880s which was run on Pennsylvania Avenue NW near the Capitol several times, but was never placed in permanent use. Underground conduit system at 14th & G Streets, NWIn 1883, Frank Sprague, an 1878 Naval Academy graduate, resigned from the Navy to work for Thomas Edison. He wound up in Richmond, Virginia, where, on February 2, 1888, he put into service the first electric-powered streetcar system. After 1888, many cities, including Washington, turned to electric-powered streetcars. To get electricity to the streetcars from the powerhouse where it was generated, an overhead wire was installed over city streets. A streetcar would touch this electric wire with a long pole mounted on its roof. Back at the powerhouse, big steam engines would turn huge generators to produce the electricity needed to operate the streetcars. A new name was soon developed for streetcars powered by electricity in this manner; they were called trolley cars. Aerial view of a street corner with street cars in front of the Willard Hotel, at 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue in 1939 New electric streetcar companies =Eckington and Soldiers' Home= Opening day, Eckington and Soldiers‚Äô Home Railway at the terminus of the line at Seventh Street and New York Avenue, NW By 1888, Washington was expanding north of Boundary Street NW into the hills of Washington Heights and Petworth. Boundary Street was becoming such a misnomer that in 1890 it was renamed Florida Avenue. Climbing the hills to the new parts of the city was difficult for horses, but electric streetcars could do it easily. In the year following the successful demonstration of the Richmond streetcar, four electric streetcar companies were incorporated in Washington, D.C. The Eckington and Soldiers' Home Railway was the first to charter, on June 19, 1888, and started operation on October 17. Its tracks started at 7th Street and New York Avenue NW, east of Mount Vernon Square, and traveled 2.5 miles to the Eckington Car Barn at 4th and T Streets NE via Boundary Street NE, Eckington Place NE, R Street NE, 3rd Street NE and T Street NE. Another line ran up 4th Street NE to Michigan Avenue NE. A one-week pass cost $1.25. In 1889, the line was extended along T Street NE, 2nd Street NE and V Street NE to Glenwood Cemetery, but the extension proved unprofitable and was closed in 1894. At the same time, an extension was built along Michigan Avenue NE to the B&O; railroad tracks. In 1895, the company removed its overhead trolley lines in accordance with its charter and attempted to replace them with batteries. These proved too costly and the company replaced them with horses in the central city. In 1896, Congress directed the Eckington and Soldier's Home to try compressed air motors and to substitute underground electric power for all its horse and overhead trolley lines in the city. The compressed-air motors were a failure and in 1899 the company switched to the standard underground electric power conduit. =Rock Creek= The Rock Creek Railway was the second electric streetcar incorporated in D.C. It was incorporated in 1888 and started operations in 1890 on two blocks of Florida Avenue east of Connecticut Avenue. After completing a bridge over Rock Creek at Calvert Street on July 21, 1891, the line was extended through Adams Morgan and north on Connecticut Avenue to Chevy Chase Lake, Maryland. In 1893, a line was added through Cardozo/Shaw to 7th Street NW. =Georgetown and Tenleytown= The third electric streetcar company to incorporate, the Georgetown and Tenleytown Railway, was chartered on August 22, 1888. In 1890, the railway started operations connecting Georgetown to the extant village of Tenleytown. The line traveled the length of the Georgetown and Rockville Road (now Wisconsin Avenue NW), stretching from the Potomac River to the Maryland state line. In 1890 it was extended across the Maryland line to Bethesda. In 1897, the Washington and Rockville Railway was formed to extend the line to Rockville. Though the two companies legally acted as different entities, they traveled identical routes on identical rails and shared a car barn (owned by WRECo) on Wisconsin Avenue NW at the District boundary. By 1900, the tracks had extended to Rockville. =Washington and Great Falls - Maryland and Washington= Diagram of 1915 electric railroad routes near the later routes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, showing the Washington and Great Falls Electric Railway (the \\"Glen Echo Electric Railroad\\"), the Great Falls division of the Washington and Old Dominion Railway (the \\"Great Falls Electric Railroad\\") and the Washington- Mount Vernon line (the \\"Washington, Alexandria, and Mount Vernon Electric Railroad\\") and the East Arlington Branch of the Washington-Virginia Railway. Two more Washington D.C. streetcar companies operating in Maryland were incorporated by acts of Congress in the summer of 1892. The Washington and Great Falls Electric Railway was approved on July 28, 1892, to build an electric streetcar line from the Aqueduct Bridge to Cabin John Creek. It completed its track in August 1895. Because the railroad never reached Great Falls, but instead terminated at Cabin John, it was often referred to as the \\"Cabin John Trolley\\". The Maryland and Washington Railway was approved a few days later on August 1, 1892. It ran on Rhode Island Avenue NE from 4th Street NE reaching what is now Mount Rainier on the Maryland line in 1897. At its southern terminus it connected to the Eckington and Soldier's Home. =Capital Railway= The first electric streetcar to operate in Anacostia was the Capital Railway. It was incorporated by Colonel Arthur Emmett Randle on March 2, 1895, to serve Congress Heights. It was to run from Shepherds Ferry along the Potomac and across the Navy Yard Bridge to M Street SE. A second line would run along Good Hope Road SE to the District boundary. The line was built during the Panic of 1896 despite 18 months of opposition from the Anacostia and Potomac River. In 1897 it experimented with the \\"Brown System\\", which used magnets in boxes to relay power instead of overhead or underground lines, and with double trolley lines over the Navy Yard Bridge. Both were failures. By 1898, the streetcar line ran along Nichols Avenue SE to Congress Heights, ending at Upsal Street SE. At the same time the Capital Railway was incorporated, the Washington and Marlboro Electric Railway was chartered to run trains across the Anacostia River through southeast Anacostia to the District boundary at Suitland Road and from there to Upper Marlboro, but it never laid any track. =Baltimore and Washington= The Baltimore and Washington Transit Company was incorporated prior to 1894, with authorization to run from the District of Columbia, across Maryland to the Pennsylvania border. On June 8, 1896, it was given permission to enter the District of Columbia and connect to the spur of the Brightwood that ran on Butternut St NW. In 1897, it began construction on a line, known locally as the Dinky Line, that began at the end of the Brightwood spur at 4th and Butternut Streets NW, traveled south on 4th Street NW to Aspen Street NW and then east on Aspen Street NW and Laurel Street NW into Maryland. Later, between 1903 and 1917, a line was added running south on 3rd St NW and west on Kennedy St NW to Colorado Avenue where it connected to Capital Traction's 14th Street line. On March 14, 1914, it changed its name to the Washington and Maryland Railway. =East Washington Heights= The East Washington Heights Traction Railroad was incorporated on June 18, 1898. By 1903 it ran from the Capitol along Pennsylvania Avenue SE to Barney Circle, and by 1908, it went across the bridge to Randle Highlands (now known as Twining) as far as 27th St SE. By 1917 it had been extended out Pennsylvania Avenue past 33rd Street SE., but the company ceased operations by 1923.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1983/10/11/hero- of-1812-remembered/7f7a0a00-0106-43e7-ae07-c1625ccc9c75/ =Washington, Spa Spring, and Gretta= The last new streetcar company to form was the Washington, Spa Spring and Gretta Railroad. It was chartered by the state of Maryland on February 13, 1905, and authorized to enter the District on February 18, 1907. Construction began by March 22, 1908. In 1910, it began running cars along a single track from a modest waiting station and car barn near 15th Street NE and H Street NE along Bladensburg Road NE to Bladensburg. [On July 5, 1892, the District of Columbia Suburban Railway was incorporated to run streetcars along the same route - on Bladensburg Road NE from the Columbia tracks on H Street NE to the Maryland line and from Brookland to Florida Avenue NE, but it was never constructed]. Although initially planned to go as far as Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the line never ran further than an extension to Berwyn Heights, Maryland. The route was planned to promote development of company-owned land adjacent to the tracks, but it never successfully competed with established rail lines in the same area. Noting its diminished ambitions, it became the Washington Interurban Railway on October 12, 1912, and changed the Railway to Railroad in 1919. Conversion of horse cars to mechanical and electrical power On March 2, 1889, the District authorized every streetcar company in Washington to switch from horse power to underground cable or to electricity provided by battery or underground wire and in 1890 companies were authorized to sell stock to pay for the upgrades - provided they did not involve overhead wires. In 1892, one-horse cars were banned within the city, and by 1894 Congress began requiring companies to switch to something other than horse power while continuing to disallow overhead lines within the city. =Washington and Georgetown= After the March 2, 1889, law passed, the Washington and Georgetown began installing an underground cable system. Their 7th Street line switched to cable car on April 12, 1890. The rest of the system switched to cable by August 18, 1892. In 1892, they extended their track along 14th to Park Road NW. =Brightwood= On October 18, 1888, the day after the Eckington and Soldier's Home began operation, Congress authorized the Brightwood Railway to electrify the Metropolitan's streetcar line on Seventh Street Extended NW or Brightwood Avenue NW (now known as Georgia Avenue NW) and to extend it to the District boundary at Silver Spring. In 1890 they bought the former Boundary and Silver Spring line from the Metropolitan, but continued to operate it as a horse line. In 1892 it was ordered by Congress to switch to overhead electrical power and complete the line. The next year, the streetcar tracks reached Takoma Park via a spur along Butternut Street NW to 4th Street NW. In 1898, the Brightwood was ordered to switch to underground electric power on pain of having its charter revoked. =Metropolitan= The Metropolitan experimented with batteries in 1890 but found them unsatisfactory. On August 2, 1894, Congress ordered the Metropolitan to switch to underground electrical power. It complied, installing the underground sliding shoe on the north‚Äìsouth line in January 1895. The Metropolitan switched the rest of the system to electric power on July 7, 1896 In 1895, the Metropolitan built a streetcar barn near the Arsenal and a loop in Georgetown to connect it to the Georgetown Car Barn. In 1896 it extended service along East Capitol Street and built the East Capitol Street Car Barn, and extended its service to Mount Pleasant. =Columbia= Columbia Railway Company Car Barns aka Trinidad Cable Car Barns, Fifteenth Street NE & Benning Road NE. The barn was built in 1895, converted to electric power in 1899 and to a bus barn in 1942. In 1971 it was demolished. The Columbia decided to try a cable system, the last cable car system built in the United States. They built a new cable car barn and began operating the system on March 9, 1895. It became clear that the underground electrical system was superior, so it quickly abandoned cable cars and switched to electrical power on July 22, 1899. The last cable car in the city ran the next day. Using electricity from the power plant built to power its cable operation, the Columbia won permission in 1898 to build a line east along Benning Road NE, splitting on the east side of the Anacostia. One branch ran to Kenilworth, and the other, built in 1900, connected at Seat Pleasant with the terminus of the steam-powered Chesapeake Beach Railway. =Belt= In 1896 the Belt Railway tried out compressed air motors. The compressed air motors were a failure, and in 1899 the cars were equipped with the standard underground power system. =Anacostia and Potomac River= The Anacostia and Potomac River switched from horses to electricity in April 1900. This was the last horse-drawn streetcar to run in the District. =Virginia trolleys operating in Washington, D.C.= Two electric trolley companies serving Northern Virginia also operated in the District and a third received permission to do so, but never did so (see: Northern Virginia trolleys): The Washington & Arlington Railway was the first Virginia company given permission to operate in Washington. It was incorporated on February 28, 1892, with the right to run a streetcar from the train station at 6th Street NW and B Street NW to Virginia across a new Three Sisters Bridge. It was also allotted space in the Georgetown Car Barn. The company was never able to construct the new bridge, and so never operated in Washington. The Washington, Alexandria, and Mount Vernon Electric Railway began operating between Alexandria and Mount Vernon in 1892. On August 23, 1894, it was given permission to enter the District of Columbia using a boat or barge. However, the railroad never actually used any such watercraft. At Google Books. The railroad completed its tracks in 1896 and began serving a waiting station at 14th Street NW and B Street NW. From the waiting station it used the Belt Line Street Railway Company's tracks on 14th Street NW to reach the Long Bridge, a combined road and rail crossing of the Potomac River. In 1906, the Long Bridge's road and streetcar tracks were relocated to a new truss bridge (the Highway Bridge), immediately west of the older bridge. This span was removed in 1967. In 1902, the railroad moved its station, as the Belt Line's tracks were circling the block containing the site of a planned new District Building (now the John A. Wilson Building). The new station (address: 1204 N. Pennsylvania Avenue) extended along 12th Street NW from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to D Street NW, near the site of the present Federal Triangle Metro station and on the opposite side of 12th Street from the Post Office building.(1) At Google Books. (2) At Google Books. (3) Washington-Virginia Railway Co. timetable in At Google Books. On October 17, 1910, the Washington and Arlington, by then the Washington, Arlington & Falls Church Railroad, and the Washington, Alexandria and Mount Vernon merged to form the Washington‚ÄìVirginia Railway. The company had difficulty competing and in 1924 declared bankruptcy. In 1927 the two companies were split and sold at auction. The former Washington, Arlington & Falls Church Railroad reemerged as the Arlington and Fairfax Railway and continued to serve the city on the Washington-Virginia route until January 17, 1932, when the Mt. Vernon Memorial Highway (now the George Washington Memorial Parkway) opened. The Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad was chartered January 24, 1900, and authorized to enter the District on January 29, 1903. It crossed over the Aqueduct Bridge and terminated at a station immediately west of the Georgetown Car Barn. In 1912, it was incorporated into the new Washington and Old Dominion Railway and became the Great Falls Division of that company. =The Great Streetcar Consolidation= Token By the mid-1890s, there were numerous streetcar companies operating in the District. Congress tried to deal with this fractured transit system by requiring them to accept transfers, set standard pricing and by allowing them to use one another's track. But eventually, lawmakers settled on consolidation as the best solution. On March 1, 1895, Congress authorized the Rock Creek to purchase the Washington and Georgetown on September 21, producing the Capital Traction Company. In Google Books. In 1916 Capital Traction took ownership of the Washington and Maryland and its 2.591 miles of track. After Capital Traction's powerhouse at 14th and E NW burned down on September 29, 1897, the company replaced the cable cars with an electric system. The 14th Street branch switched to electric power on February 27, 1898, the Pennsylvania Avenue division on April 20, 1898, and the 7th Street branch on May 26, 1898. The Anacostia and Potomac River began expanding on June 24, 1898, by purchasing the Belt Railway; the next year, it bought the Capital Railway. Later that year, the Eckington and Soldier's Home purchased the Maryland and Washington. On June 27, 1898, the new, combined company changed its name to the City and Suburban Railway of Washington. Later that year, it bought the Columbia and Maryland Railway, which ran from Mount Rainier to Laurel. Between 1896 and 1899, three businessmen purchased controlling interests in the Metropolitan; the Columbia; the Anacostia and Potomac River; the Georgetown and Tennallytown; the Washington, Woodside and Forest Glen; the Washington and Great Falls; and the Washington and Rockville railway companies, in addition to the Potomac Electric Power Company and the United States Electric Lighting Company. They incorporated the Washington Traction and Electric Company on June 5, 1899, as a holding company for these interests. But the holding company had borrowed too heavily and paid too much for the subsidiaries and quickly landed in financial trouble. To prevent transit disruption, Congress on June 5, 1900, authorized the Washington and Great Falls to acquire the stock of any and all of the railways and power companies owned by Washington Traction. When Washington Traction defaulted on its loans on June 1, 1901, Washington and Great Falls moved in to take its place. On February 4, 1902, Washington and Great Falls changed its name to the Washington Railway and Electric Company, reincorporated as a holding company and exchanged stock in Washington Traction and Electric one for one for stock in the new company (at a discounted rate). Not every company became a part of Washington Railway immediately. The City and Suburban and the Georgetown and Tennallytown operated as subsidiaries of Washington Railway until October 31, 1926, when it purchased the remainder of their stock. The former Capital Traction Power House on the Georgetown waterfront. Built in 1910-11 it was shut down in 1935, decommissioned in 1943 and demolished in October 1968.During this time the streetcar companies continued to expand both trackage and service. The American Sight-Seeing Car and Coach Company started running tourist cars along Washington Railway streetcar tracks in 1902 and continued until it switched to large automobiles in 1904. In 1908, Washington Railway's U Street line was extended east down Florida Avenue NW/NE to 8th Street NE, and from there south down 8th Street NE/SE to the Navy Yard. On June 24, 1908, the first streetcars began service to Union Station along Delaware Avenue NE and by December 6 cars of both Capital Traction and Washington Railway were serving the building along Massachusetts Avenue NE. In 1908, the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway began service from Washington to Baltimore and Annapolis. Though technically an interurban, this railway utilized streetcar tracks from its terminal at 15th and H Streets NE and across the Benning Road Bridge where it switched to its own tracks in Deanwood. It was the main source of transportation to Suburban Gardens, known as \\"the black Glen Echo\\", the first and only major amusement park within Washington. The next major consolidation occurred on August 31, 1912, when the Washington Railway purchased the controlling stock of the Anacostia and Potomac River. This left six companies operating in Washington, four of which had less than 3 miles of track. It also led to Congress passing the \\"Anti- Merger Act\\", prohibiting mergers without Congress' approval and establishing the Public Utilities Commission. In 1914 a failed attempt was made to have the Federal Government purchase all of the streetcar lines and companies. Streetcars were unionized in 1916 when local 689 of the Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America won recognition after a three-day strike. Further consolidation came in the form of the North American Company, a transit and public utility holding company. North American began to acquire stock in Washington Railway in 1922, gaining a controlling interest by 1928. By December 31, 1933, it owned 50.016% of the voting stock. North American tried to purchase Capital Traction, but never owned more than 2.5% of Capital Traction stock. =Bustitution and competition= By 1916 streetcar use was reaching its peak in Washington, D.C. The combined systems had over 200 miles of track, with almost 100 in the city. Passengers could travel to Great Falls, Glen Echo, Rockville, Kensington and Laurel in Maryland; and to Mount Vernon, Alexandria, Vienna, Fairfax, Leesburg, Great Falls and Bluemont in Virginia. World War I saw further increases in passenger traffic. But the streetcars were also under increasing threat from competition. The first threat to the streetcars came with the introduction of gasoline powered taxicabs. The taximeter, invented in 1891, combined with the combustion engine, created a new form of public transportation. Taxicabs were put into service in Paris in 1899, in New York in 1907 and in Washington in 1908. Over the years, their numbers expanded. Taxis based and operating in the boundaries of the District of Columbia charged their fares with a zone system instead of taximeters, which is still in use. In 1909 the Metropolitan Coach Company began to switch from horse- drawn coaches to gasoline-powered coaches - replacing its entire system by 1913 - becoming a precursor to the bus companies. It was a financial failure though and on August 13, 1915, the company ceased operations. The gasoline- powered bus was invented in Germany in 1895 and motorized buses were introduced in New York City in 1905. As improvements, such as balloon tires, were made, buses became more popular. The first formal bus company in Washington, the Washington Rapid Transit Company, was incorporated on January 20, 1921. By 1932 it was carrying 4.5% of transit customers. Two years later, the last streetcar line was built. Just as the horse cars had replaced carriages and the electric streetcar replaced horse cars, so too were buses to replace the electric streetcars. In 1923, the number of streetcar companies operating in Washington cut in half as three companies switched to buses. The East Washington Heights became the first streetcar company to switch, replacing its two streetcars and one mile of track with a bus line. The Washington Interurban switched next and its tracks were removed when Bladensburg Road was repaved. In that same year, the Key Bridge was constructed and, as a result, the Washington and Old Dominion (the state of Virginia) gave up rail access to D.C. in exchange for a terminal in Rosslyn. When electric streetcars began, several lines also delivered freight on rail cars running on their lines. Capital Traction abandoned this service in 1931. In 1932, the Arlington and Fairfax Motor Transportation Company was established to replace the streetcar service of the Arlington and Fairfax which lost the right to use the Highway Bridge. The last Arlington and Fairfax streetcar departed from 12th Street NW and D Street NW, on January 17, 1932, abandoning all streetcar service in the city. In the summer of 1935 - after consolidation, several major lines were converted from streetcars to buses. The line from Friendship Heights to Rockville (formerly the Washington and Rockville), the P Street line (Metropolitan), the Anacostia-Congress Heights line (Capital Railway) and the Connecticut Avenue line in Chevy Chase (Rock Creek) were all replaced with buses. At the same time, the Chesapeake Beach Railway and the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis interurban ceased operations. With further bustitution, the Columbia Railway Company Car Barn was converted to a bus barn in 1942.The last streetcar on the Anacostia- Congress Heights line ran on July 16, 1935. =Monopoly= On December 1, 1933, Washington Railway, Capital Traction, and Washington Rapid Transit merged to form the Capital Transit Company. Washington Railway continued as a holding company, owning 50% of Capital Transit and 100% of PEPCO, but Capital Traction was dissolved. For the first time, street railways in Washington were under the management of one company. In tribute to Washington's use of PCC streetcars, this ex-Newark streetcar currently running in heritage streetcar service in San Francisco wears DC Transit colors. Capital Transit made several changes. As part of the merger, the Capital Traction generating plant in Georgetown was closed (and, in 1943, decommissioned) and Capital Transit used only conventionally supplied electric power. In 1935, it closed several lines and replaced them with bus service. Because the Rockville line in Maryland was one of the lines that was closed, the Capital Transit Community Terminal was opened at Wisconsin Avenue NW and Western Avenue NW on August 4, 1935. At the same time, the car barn on the west side of Wisconsin at Ingomar was razed and replaced with the Western Bus Garage. In 1936, the system introduced route numbers. On August 28, 1937, the first PCC streetcars began running on 14th Street NW. By early 1946, the company would place in service 489 of the streamlined, modern PCC model and, in the early 1950s, become the first in the nation to have an all-PCC fleet. (Here's a General Electric ad about PCC cars in Washington.) During the 1930s, city newspapers began pushing for streetcar tunneling. The Capitol Subway was built in 1906 and three years later, the Washington Post called for a citywide subway to be built. Nothing happened until Capital Transit took over. The full $35 million plan to depress streets as trenches for exclusive streetcar use never materialized, but in 1942 an underground loop terminal was built at 14th and C Streets SW under the Bureau of Engraving and on December 14, 1949, the Connecticut Avenue subway tunnel under Dupont Circle, running from N Street to R Street, was opened. At first, business was good for the new company. During World War II, gasoline rationing limited automobile use, but transit companies were exempt from the rationing. Meanwhile, wage freezes held labor costs in check. With increased revenue and steady costs, Capital Transit conservatively built up a $7 million cash reserve. In 1945 Capital Transit had America's 3rd largest streetcar fleet. (A map of the system in 1948) In 1946 in a decision by the United States Supreme Court in North American Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Supreme Court upheld the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and forced North American, because it also owned the Potomac Electric Power Co., to sell its shares of Capital Transit. Buyers were hard to come by, but on September 12, 1949, Louis Wolfson and his three brothers purchased from North American 46.5% of the company's stock for $20 per share and the Washington Railway was dissolved. For $2.2 million they bought a company with $7 million in cash. The Wolfsons began paying themselves huge dividends until, in 1955, the war chest was down to $2.7 million. During the same period, transit trips dropped by 40,000 trips per day and automobile ownership doubled. On December 29, 1954, Capital Transit lost one of its last freight customers when the East Washington Railway took over the delivery of coal from the B&O; to the PEPCO power plant at Benning. Previously this had been done using Capital Transit's steeple-cab electric locomotives operating over a remnant of the Benning car line. =DC Transit= Thomas Circle, 1943 In January 1955 the Capital Transit Company, then consisting of 750 buses and 450 streetcars, sought permission for a fare increase, but was denied. So that spring, when employees asked for a raise, there was no money available and the company refused to increase pay. Frustrated, employees went on strike on July 1, 1955. The strike, only the third in D.C. history and the first since a three-day strike in 1945, lasted for seven weeks. Commuters were forced to hitch rides and walk in the brutal summer heat. On July 18, 1956, after Wolfson dared the Senate to revoke his franchise claiming no other entrepreneur would take the company on, the Congress did just that. Months later, the franchise was sold to O. Roy Chalk, a New York financier who owned controlling interest in Trans Caribbean Airways, for $13.5 million. The company's name was then changed to DC Transit. In 1971, Robert W. Dickerson Jr. of Crozet, Virginia, became the first black superintendent of D.C. Transit. In the previous summer of 1970 D.C. Transit \\"...came under fire from a group of its black drivers for discrimination in promotions and assignments.\\" There were specific complaints about a lack of black leadership. Dickerson graduated from Jackson P. Burley High School, Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1953. He then attended Virginia State College. After serving in the US Army he joined DC Transit as a bus operator. He moved through the ranks from Depot Clerk, to Street Operation Supervisor, Dispatcher and Division Supervisor, Acting Co-ordinator of Operating Personnel, and finally on January 3, 1971, was promoted by the president, O. Roy Chalk, to Superintendent of Operating Personnel. =Abandonment= As part of the deal selling Capital Transit to O. Roy Chalk, he was required to replace the system with buses by 1963. Chalk fought the retirement of the streetcars but was unsuccessful, and the final abandonment of the streetcar system began on September 7, 1958, with the end of the North Capitol Street (Route 80) and Maryland (Route 82) lines. On January 3, 1960, the Glen Echo (Route 20), Friendship Heights (Route 30) & Georgia Avenue (Routes 70, 72, 74) streetcar lines were abandoned and the Southern Division (Maine Avenue) Car Barn was closed. This technically ended \\"trolley\\" cars in D.C. as only conduit operations remained. On December 3, 1961, the streetcar lines to Mount Pleasant (Routes 40, 42) and 11th Street (Route 60) were abandoned. The remaining system, including lines to the Navy Yard, the Colorado Avenue terminal, and the Bureau of Engraving (Routes 50, 54) and to the Calvert Street Loop, Barney Circle, and Union Station (Routes 90, 92) was shut down in January 1962. Early on the morning of Sunday, January 28, 1962, preceded by cars 1101 and 1053, car 766 entered the Navy Yard Car Barn for the last time, and Washington's streetcars became history. The last scheduled run, filled with enthusiasts and drunken college students, left 14th and Colorado at 2:17am and arrived at Navy Yard ten minutes late at 3:05am. One last special trip, carrying organized groups of trolley enthusiasts, set out after that and returned at 4:45am. By the afternoon of the 28th, workers began tearing out the streetcar tracks and platforms along 14th Street. Remnants =Streetcars= This 4-wheel, electric motor car was one of sixteen built for the Capital Traction Company by the American Car Company. Car#303 was assigned to the 7th Street line, which ran from the Wharves to Boundary. It was used as a motor car and regularly pulled a light trailer car until its retirement from regular service in 1913. This car, on display at the Museum of American History is the only Washington streetcar still in the District.After the system was abandoned, most of the cars were either destroyed or sold. Several hundred cars were scrapped, cut in half at the center door and junked. 101 of the streetcars were sold to Barcelona where some continued in service until 1971. 71 more were sold to Sarajevo where they ran until 1983 and some of them were used for construction of the only 9 articulated PCC streetcars ever; and 15 more went to Fort Worth, TX for use on the Tandy Center Subway until it shut down in 2002. About 20 streetcars remain of the hundreds that once plied the streets of Washington. None remain in active daily use, although one Capital Transit PCC car sold to Sarajevo has been restored and operates occasional special service in Sarajevo. Another, Capital Transit 1551, one of the 15 trams sold to Fort Worth, was repainted and transferred to the McKinney heritage streetcar in Dallas in 2002, but it has been out of service since 2006 with mechanical and electrical problems. Others serve as museum pieces. The only Washington streetcar still in the District is Capital Traction 303 which serves as an exhibit in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Washington and Georgetown 212 is also preserved by the Smithsonian, but stored in the Smithsonian's facility in Suitland, Maryland. Seven more, including D.C. Transit 1101 and 1540, Capital Transit 509, 522, 766 and 1430, and Washington Railway 650, are preserved at the National Capital Trolley Museum in the Washington suburbs. Three other cars owned by the Trolley Museum were destroyed in a fire on September 28, 2003. Farther from D.C., D.C. Transit 1470 is kept at the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke, Virginia, Capital Transit 09 is at Rockhill Trolley Museum in Rockhill Furnace, Pennsylvania, Capital Transit 010 is maintained at the Connecticut Trolley Museum and D.C. Transit 1304 is kept at the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine. Three of the Ft. Worth cars are held in storage by North Texas Historic Transportation with plans to place them in a yet-to-be-built museum. Finally, two of the Barcelona cars are privately owned and stored in Madrid, Spain, and Ejea de los Caballeros, Spain, and another two are in the Museu del Transport in Castellar de n'Hug, Spain (Photo of one). =Tracks= P Street NW tracks installed in the 1890s with its underground-power-line slot. The line ceased on January 3, 1960, when the Cabin John line (Route 20) was abandoned.Much of the track in D.C. was removed and sold for scrap. The complex trackwork on Capitol Plaza in front of Washington Union Station was removed in the mid-1960s. The Pennsylvania Avenue NW trackwork between the Capitol and the Treasury Building was removed during the street's mid-1980s redevelopment. Elsewhere, the track was buried under pavement. The loop tracks of the former Capitol Transit connection, behind the closed restaurant on Calvert Street NW, immediately east of the Duke Ellington Bridge, are extant under asphalt. The tracks on Florida Avenue also exist under pavement (as shown by the eternal seam above the conduit). Tracks also exist under Ellington Place NE, 3rd Street NE, 8th Street SE, and elsewhere. In 1977, the tracks on M and Pennsylvania in Georgetown were paved over. Perhaps the sole remaining visible trackage is the tracks and conduit in the center of the cobblestone of the 3200 through 3400 blocks of P Street NW and O Street NW in Georgetown. =Car barns and shops= Some car barns, or car houses as they were later known, survived in part or in whole. Georgetown Park front * The Washington and Georgetown Car Barn (later known as the M Street Shops) at 3222 M Street NW, which had served as stables for Gilbert Vanderwerken's omnibus line, a streetcar garage and maintenance shop and as a tobacco warehouse, was turned into a mall known as The Shops at Georgetown Park in 1981. Only the facade of the original car barn remains. * The Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company Car Barn at 1346 Florida Avenue NW, originally built in 1877 and sold in 1892, is known today as the west building of the Manhattan Laundry. It served as the home to the Booker T. Washington Public Charter School from 1999 to 2014. It's now home to the Franklin Hall bar, Maydan restaurant and La Colombe coffee. * The original Eckington Car Barn at 400 T Street NE burned down before 1920 and a new one was built to replace it. That building is now a postal vehicle maintenance facility. Navy Yard Car Barn * The Navy Yard Car Barn (officially the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Car House and colloquially \\"The Blue Castle\\") at 770 M Street SE is the sole surviving artifact of the cable car era. It served as a bus garage and is now home to two charter schools: KEY Academy, Richard Wright Public Charter School, and the Eagle Academy. In 2005, it was purchased by a developer who hoped to turn it into retail space. In January 2008, it was sold to another developer who intended to turn it into mixed-use development when the current lease expired in 2012. Instead it was sold to National Community Church in 2014 which hopes to build a multi-use performance venue and to create a mixed use marketplace. Old streetcar barn building in Georgetown * The Georgetown Car Barn at 3600 M Street NW, with \\"Capital Traction Company\\" still written above the main door, now serves as classroom and administrative space for Georgetown University. It includes the famous \\"Exorcist steps\\" that connect Prospect Street NW to M Street NW. O. Roy Chalk owned the building until 1992 when the Minneapolis-based Lutheran Brotherhood took possession of the property in a foreclosure. Developer Douglas Jemal bought it in May 1997. * The East Capitol Street Car Barn, at 1400 East Capitol Street NE, was used as a bus barn from 1962 to 1973 and then sat vacant until it was turned into condominiums. * The Decatur Street Car Barn (a.k.a. the Capital Traction Company Car Barn or Northern Carhouse), at 4615 14th Street NW, was built in 1906 and is now used as a Metrobus barn. One of three designed by Waddy Wood, it is the only car barn still used for transit. The Decatur Street Car Barn, built in 1906, is now a bus barn. * Benning Car House, the red brick building at the northeast corner of Benning Road & Kenilworth Avenue on the grounds of the Benning Road PEPCO plant, was built in 1941 and went out of service with the conversion of this carline to buses on May 1, 1949. The building has been structurally modified and still stands. *Grace Street Power House, at 3221 Grace Street. Built in 1917 by the D.C. Paper Manufacturing Company, the three-bay brick-and-steel structure was built to serve as the power house for the paper company. By 1919, the paper company was using a different power house and this one was purchased by the Capitol Traction Company, to use as a store room. Other car barns were demolished. * The Anacostia and Potomac River Car Barn at Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE and V Street SE is gone. * The Columbia Railway Car Barn in Trinidad served as a bus barn until it was demolished in 1971 and replaced with apartments. * The Metropolitan Street Railway Car Barn (a.k.a. the Seventh Street-Wharves Barn) and the adjacent shops on 4th Street SW were torn down in 1962 to make room for the Riverside Condominiums. * The Tenleytown Car Barn (a.k.a. Western Carhouse or Tennally Town Car Barn), the first car barn and powerhouse for the Tennallytown line, was built around 1897 at what is now the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue NW and Calvert Street NW.Photograph of Tenally Town Car Barn in It was removed sometime before 1920 and replaced around 1935. This second structure was removed before 1958. * The Capital Traction Company Powerhouse in Georgetown was torn down in 1968; the land it sat on is now part of the Georgetown Waterfront Park. * Falls Barn, near Georgetown University, was demolished between 1948 and 1958. * A car barn was built in Mount Pleasant around 1892, but it was gone by 1948. * A barn was built at 2411 P Street NW by the Metropolitan around 1870 and served as stables, a power house, car barn and repair shops. Much of the property was destroyed when Q Street was extended, but the remainder lasted until at least 1920. * The Brightwood Car House, at 5929 Georgia Avenue NW, was built in 1909 as a car barn and electric generation substation to replace a 'car stable' that burned down on January 16, 1898. It was designed by the engineer W.B. Upton who also designed the Eckington car barn. In 1955 PEPCO sold the car barn, and it ceased operation as a streetcar facility. It became the showroom and service center for Hicks Chevrolet which modified the facade. In 1976 the dealership was sold and became Curtis Chevrolet. Curtis Chevrolet closed on November 30, 2007, and was sold to Foulger-Pratt for redevelopment. Though the D.C. Historical Preservation Society asked Foulger-Pratt to reuse, not destroy, the car house,Moore, Wayetu. Historical Society Scrutinizing Plans for High-Rise on Former Car Lot in Brightwood. Black College View. 2008-04-06. in 2010, Walmart announced that they planned to raze the car barn and build a store on the site, to open in 2012. Plans by Walmart to bring the entire structure down were approved and demolition began on September 6, 2011. Demolition was shortly thereafter halted for a historical preservation review, but historic designation was denied and the entire structure came down in March 2012. The Walmart opened on December 2, 2013. The new structure included bricks and trusses from the original car barn, which is all that remains of it. =Stations and loops= Station at 14th Street NW and Colorado Avenue, NW A few stations and terminals have survived. Sometime after conversion of the Mt. Pleasant Line in December 1961, the Dupont Circle streetcar stations were used as a civil defense storage area for a few years and then left empty again. The space was once considered for a columbarium. In 1993 one of the stations was opened as a food court called DuPont Down Under, but after only 18 months it closed. In 2007, D.C. Council member Jim Graham began consideration of a suggestion to allow adult-themed clubs to move into the property. It has now been set aside as an arts space and is under the management of the Dupont Underground. The Colorado Avenue Terminal on 14th Street NW is still in use as a Metrobus stop and the Calvert Street loop just east of the Duke Ellington Bridge is still used as a Metrobus turnaround loop. There was a streetcar station in the center of Barney Circle but it was removed in the 1970s. The streetcar turnaround at 11th and Monroe NW is now the 11th and Monroe Streets Park. =Tunnels= The Dupont Circle streetcar station tunnel entrances, located where the medians of Connecticut Avenue NW now stand, north of N Street NW, and between R Street NW and S Street NW, were filled in and paved over in August 1964, leaving only the traffic tunnel. The C Street NW/NE tunnel beneath the Upper Senate Park remained in use as a one-way service road adjacent to the Capitol, but since 9/11 it has been closed to the public. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing underground loop is now part of a parking structure and storage area that is located directly underneath 14th Street SW. Tracks can still be seen in the floors in some locations of the Bureau. =Right-of-way= left The right-of-way of the Glen Echo line is mostly extant from the Georgetown Car Barn all the way to the Dalecarlia Reservoir filtration plant in DC and from the District line to Cabin John in Maryland. The DC section includes an abutment near an entrance to Georgetown University, a trestle over Foundry Branch in Glover Archibald Park, the median of Sherier Place NW from Cathedral Avenue NW to Manning Place NW and a strip of land along most of the right-or-way. Part of the right-of-way on the Georgetown campus was removed in the spring of 2007 to create a turning lane off of Canal Road NW. Bridge #1 at Georgetown University was removed in 1976. The section from the aqueduct to Foxhall Road was purchased by the District of Columbia in the early 1980s to construct a crosstown watermain. In 1980 and 1981, the three other bridges along the right-of-way - Bridge #3 at Clark Place, Bridge #4 next to Reservoir Road, and Bridge #5 over Maddox Branch in Battery Kemble Park - were removed during the construction of the water main. Bridge #6 over the Little Falls Branch Valley was removed sometime prior to 2000. The wide median of Pennsylvania Avenue SE from the Capitol to Barney Circle was built in 1903 to serve as a streetcar right of way. It now serves as urban greenspace. =Other remnants= Extant manhole cover from the Anacostia and Potomac River Railroad Company Perhaps the most visible remnant of the streetcar system is the Metrobus system, run by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). On January 14, 1973, WMATA purchased DC Transit and the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company (followed on February 4 by the purchase of AB&W; Transit Company and WMA Transit Company) unifying all the bus companies in D.C. Many of today's WMATA's bus routes are only marginally changed from the streetcar lines they followed. For example, the #30 streetcar route that ran from Barney Circle to Friendship Heights is now the #30 bus line that runs from Anacostia through Barney Circle to Friendship Heights. Lamppost on Klingle Bridge that also carried overhead line to power streetcars Still other remnants include the Potomac Electric Power Company, the electric portion of Washington Traction and Electric Company, which remains the D.C. area's primary electrical power company; some streetcar-related manhole covers that remain in use around town; and four tall lampposts for Capital Traction's overhead wires on the Connecticut Avenue Bridge over Klingle Valley in Cleveland Park. The poles likely date back to the bridge's construction in 1931.

Marie, Ontario. The station was originally launched by Algonquin Radio, a local business consortium led by Carmen Greco, with a 250 watt signal at 1400 on the AM dial. In 1961, the station moved to 920 AM, and increased its signal to 10,000 watts daytime and 5,000 watts nighttime. Well known program announcers in the early and mid 1960s included morning man, Dave Carter, Art Christmas, country music specialist Bill Haight, Johnny Meadows (who for a period of time was also the program director of the station) and host of the evening rock show, Barry Sarazin. News announcers included Karl Sepkowski (news director), Russ Hilderley and on the weekends Norm Fera. In 1964, Algonquin launched CKCY-FM. The station operated on a frequency of 104.3 MHz with an effective radiated power of 6,760 watts. The program director and principal announcer for the FM station was Richard (\\"Dick\\") Gasparini. In contrast to the station's 'AM' programming, CKCY-FM focussed on a diet of 'easy listening' music during the day and classical music in the evenings. In the 1960s and 1970s, Harry Wolfe, the play-by-play voice of the Ontario Hockey League's Sault Greyhounds, hosted a daily call-in talk show called Open Mike. By then, CKCY had become the principal Top 40 music station in the Twin Saults. Among the station's alumni is current Hamilton City Councillor Bob Bratina. In 1976, the stations were acquired by Huron Broadcasting, who also launched CKCY-TV in 1978. Huron subsequently sold the radio stations to a new business consortium, CKCY 920 Ltd., in 1985. That group subsequently sold them to Mid-Canada Radio in 1988, and Mid-Canada in turn was acquired by the Pelmorex Radio Network in 1990. In 1984, CKCY received CRTC approval to move from 920 kHz to 540 kHz.Decision CRTC 84-80 The change to AM 540 was never implemented. CKCY remained at AM 920 until its permanent sign-off in 1992. Due to the economic circumstances of the Sault Ste. Marie market, with competition from stations in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan severely curtailing the profitability of the Ontario stations, Pelmorex shut down the AM station in 1992.Public Notice CRTC 1992-62 The FM station is still operating as CJQM-FM.Decision CRTC 93-51 The final song to be played by CKCY was Sweeney Todd's 1975 single \\"Roxy Roller\\" at approximately 11:56 pm on August 30, 1992. Once the song was completed, an automated, repeating farewell message was broadcast past midnight and continued for several days. The actual date when CKCY ceased transmitting is not known.

Gnash is available both as a standalone player for desktop computers and embedded devices, as well as a plugin for several browsers.Gnash Project It is part of the GNU Project and is a free and open-source alternative to Adobe Flash Player. It was developed from the gameswf project. Gnash was first announced in late 2005Welcome to the Gnash project! Gnash mailing list, 20 December 2005 by software developer John Gilmore. , the project's maintainer is Rob Savoye. The main developer's web site for Gnash is located on the Free Software Foundation's GNU Savannah project support server. Gnash supports most SWF v7 features and some SWF v8 and v9, however SWF v10 is not supported.  History  Writing a free software Flash player has been a priority of the GNU Project for some time. Prior to the launch of Gnash, the GNU Project had asked for people to assist the GPLFlash project. The majority of the previous GPLFlash developers have now moved to the Gnash project and the existing GPLFlash codebase will be refocused towards supporting embedded systems. The primary distribution terms for Gnash are those of the GNU GPL. However, since Gnash was started using the codebase of the gameswf project, which is in the public domain, code developed by the Gnash project which might be useful in gameswf is placed in the public domain.  Technical details  = Architecture = Adobe only provides an outdated version (11.2) of its official player for Linux on IA-32 and an AMD64 developer preview release in a binary-only form. Gnash, however, can be compiled and executed on many architectures, including x86, ARM, MIPS, and PowerPC. It also supports BSD-based operating systems. An early port for RISC OS, which has never had Macromedia/Adobe Flash support beyond Flash 3, does exist, as well as an early port for BeOS, where Flash support terminated at Version 4. Development of a port to AmigaOS 4.1 has also recently begun. A port to the Haiku Operating System also exists. Gnash requires one of AGG, Cairo, or OpenGL for rendering. In contrast to most GNU projects, which are typically written in C, Gnash is written in the C++ programming language because of its gameswf heritage. = Flash compatibility = Gnash can play SWF files up to version 7, and 80% of ActionScript 2.0. The goal of the Gnash developers is to be as compatible as possible with the proprietary player (including behavior on bad ActionScript code). However, Gnash offers some special features not available in the Adobe player, such as the possibility to extend the ActionScript classes via shared libraries: sample extensions include MySQL support, file system access and more. For security reasons the extension mechanism must be compiled-in explicitly and enabled via configuration files. = Video support = Gnash supports playback of FLV videos and allows playing some FLV files from YouTube, Myspace, ShowMeDo and other similar websites (older files with sound ‚Äì newer files without playing sound). FLV support requires FFmpeg or GStreamer to be installed on the system. Some other free-software programs, such as MPlayer, VLC media player or players for Windows based on the ffdshow DirectShow codecs can play back the FLV format if the file is specially downloaded or piped to it. Version 0.8.8 was released 22 August 2010. Rob Savoye announced that Gnash should now work with all YouTube videos.Gnash Project Rob's Blog Version 0.8.8 has GPU support, which pushed it ahead of the proprietary Adobe Flash Player in Linux, until Flash 10.2 came out with hardware acceleration built in. Gnash still suffers from high CPU usage. A Flashblock plugin can be installed by the user, turning on the Flash support on a case-by-case, as needed basis. YouTube video controls and full screen mode is functioning, although version 0.8.8 has a bug that can cause YouTube to display \\"Invalid parameters\\". Many popular Flash games do not work with Gnash 0.8.8.  Cygnal  Cygnal is the Gnash Project's Flash Media Server-compatible audio and video server. It handles negotiating the copyright metadata exchange, as well as streaming the content. It will need to handle many thousands of simultaneous network connection, and support running on large GNU/Linux clusters. It should support handling multiple streams with differing content, as well as a multicast stream with a single data source. Due to the patent issues surrounding MP3, and the fact that FLV and ON2 are closed formats, one of the main goals of this project is to support free codes and free protocols as the primary way of doing things.

As of March 2012, the lead developer reported donations were barely enough to pay for hosting the project on the web.  Adobe Flash Player End-User License Agreement  One problem for the project is the difficulty of finding developers. The current developers have never installed Adobe's Flash player, because they fear that anyone who has ever installed the Adobe Flash Player has at the same time accepted an agreement not to modify or reverse engineer Flash player. Therefore, the Gnash project has only about 6 active developers, as of November 2010. Such generic clauses, however, may be against national anticompetition laws when used in normal software license agreements.

The term stadia comes from a Greek unit of length Stadion (equal to 600 Greek feet, pous) which was the typical length of a sports stadium of the time. Stadiametric rangefinding is used for surveying and in the telescopic sights of firearms, artillery pieces, or tank guns, as well as some binoculars and other optics. It is still widely used in long-range military sniping, but in many professional applications it is being replaced with microwave, infrared, or laser rangefinding methods. Although much easier to use, electronic rangefinders can give away the shooter's position to a well-equipped adversary, and the need for accurate range estimation existed for much longer than electronic rangefinders small and rugged enough to be suitable for military use.  Principle  Table for range estimation showing target sizes, distances and corresponding angular measurements. Angular sizes are given in milliradians (mil), ranges in meters, and target sizes are shown in both in centimeters, millimeters and inches. Targeting reticule of the M67 recoilless rifle, correctly ranging a tank at 275 m range. Antitank weapons of the 1940‚Äì70s used stadiametric range estimation based on the average sizes of armoured fighting vehicles The stadia method is based upon the principle of similar triangles. This means that, for a triangle with a given angle, the ratio of opposite side length to adjacent side length (tangent) is constant. By using a reticle with marks of a known angular spacing, the principle of similar triangles can be used to find either the distance to objects of known size or the size of objects at a known distance. In either case, the known parameter is used, in conjunction with the angular measurement, to derive the length of the other side. Stadiametric rangefinding often uses the milliradian (\\"mil\\" or \\"mrad\\") as the unit of angular measurement. Since a radian is defined as the angle formed when the length of a circular arc equals the radius of the circle, a milliradian is the angle formed when the length of a circular arc equals 1/1000 of the radius of the circle. For telescopic angles, the approximations of sin(alpha) = tan(alpha) = alpha greatly simplify the trigonometry, enabling one to scale objects measured in milliradians through a telescope by a factor of 1000 for distance or height. An object 5 meters high, for example, will cover 1 mrad at 5000 meters, or 5 mrad at 1000 meters, or 25 mrad at 200 meters. Since the radian expresses a ratio, it is independent of the units used; an object 6 feet high covering 1 mrad will be 6000 feet distant. In practice, it can be seen that rough approximations may be made with a right triangle whose base (b) is equal to the distance of the 'rangefinder' from the eye; with the aperture (a) being the hole through which the target is sighted ‚Äì the apex of this triangle being on the surface of the user's eye. For a standard distance from the eye (b) of 28\\" (71.12 cm); this being the common length of an archer's draw: :28\\" √ó 1 milliradian ‚âà 0.028\\" (0.071 cm) -- stadia factor 1000 :10 milliradians ‚âà 0.280\\" (0.711 cm) -- stadia factor x 100 :100 milliradians ‚âà 2.80\\" (7.112 cm) -- stadia factor x10 The approximate range of an object one foot (30.48 cm) in height covering roughly 100 milliradians is 10 feet (3.048 m) or: :Range (r) = approximate height of object (h) √ó (1000 √∑ aperture in milliradians (a)) :r = h(1000/a) ‚Üí where r and h are identical units, and a is in milliradians. :r = h/a ‚Üí where r and h are identical units, and a is in radians The above formula functions for any system of linear measure provided r and h are calculated with the same units. Surveying Stadia readings used in surveying can be taken with modern instruments such as transits, theodolites, plane-table alidades and levels. When using the stadia measuring method, a level staff is held so that it appears between two stadia marks visible on the instrument's reticle. The stadia rod has measurements written on it that can be read through the telescope of the instrument, providing a known remote height for the distance calculations. An instrument equipped for stadia work has two horizontal stadia marks spaced equidistant from the center crosshair of the reticle. The interval between stadia marks in most surveying instruments is 10 mrad and gives a stadia interval factor of 100. The distance between the instrument and a stadia rod can be determined simply by multiplying the measurement between the stadia hairs (known as the stadia interval) by 100. The instrument must be level for this method to work directly. If the instrument line of sight is inclined relative to the staff, the horizontal and vertical distance components must be determined. Some instruments have additional graduations on a vertical circle to assist with these inclined measurements. These graduated circles, known as stadia circles, provide the value of the horizontal and the vertical measurements as a percentage of the inclined stadia measurement. This system is sufficiently precise for locating topographic details such as rivers, bridges, buildings, and roads when an accuracy of 1/500 (0.2%, 2000ppm) is acceptable. Stadia readings are also used to provide repeated, independent observations for improved accuracy and to provide error checking against blunders in levelling. The stadia method of distance measurement is primarily historical for surveying purposes, as distance nowadays is mostly measured by electronic or taping methods. Total station instruments do not have stadia lines marked on the reticle. Traditional methods are still used in areas where modern instruments are not common or by aficionados to antique surveying methods.

The lender is given a senior secured interest on the asset and an assignment of the lease and lease payments. The lessee typically makes payments directly to the lender as the lease payments are assigned to the lender. The term may also refer to a lease agreement wherein the lessor, by borrowing funds from a lending institution, finances the purchase of the asset being leased. The lessor pays the lending institution back by way of the lease payments received from the lessee. Under the loan agreement, the lender has rights to the asset and the lease payments if the lessor defaults.

Unlike most others, Fancher seems to have met most of the people who played major roles in his formative years, in person, at the YIPL/TAP meetings that were taking place on the Lower East Side of New York City. Fancher's peers included several hackers and phone phreaks of the day.MindVox: Last Exit For The Lost The hacker publication Phrack is filled with out-of-character rants at the games Fancher was playing.http://www.phreak.org/archives/The_Hacker_Chronicles_II/phrk1/ph079.txt:: Phrack Magazine :: :: Phrack Magazine :: :: Phrack Magazine :: All of this culminated right around the time MindVox was first launched, with Phrack's first (and only) humor issue (Phrack #36) Phrack Magazine, also called \\"Diet Phrack\\", which was filled with LOD members stepping out from behind their usual handles and acting more like what the world had grown to expect from their rival gang, MOD (Masters of Deception). Among other articles, such as Chris Goggans' \\"jive\\" version of the Book of MOD :: Phrack Magazine :: that set off the Great Hacker War, Phrack 36 included the first and last, official publication of an article co-written by Fancher and Kroupa, called \\"Elite Access\\",:: Phrack Magazine :: which was a cynical and funny expose of the \\"elite\\" and private hacker underground of the day.

Although MindVox quickly became notorious for the escapades of its hard-partying clientele, there is little or no evidence that Fancher was involved personally in the wild lifestyles of its members. However, he was at least indirectly affected, in that by 1995 Kroupa's drug use was fast becoming legendary and his ability to function on a daily basis was diminishing.

Bailey is currently the president of production at Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, a role he has served since his appointment in 2010. Career As a co-founder and executive of LivePlanet, Bailey served as executive producer for The Emperor's Club, the Emmy Award-nominated Project Greenlight, Push, Nevada (which he also co-wrote with Ben Affleck), producer Best Laid Plans, Matchstick Men, and Gone Baby Gone. From 2004-08, Bailey continued as chairman and board member of LivePlanet while under a writing-producing deal at ABC Studios. In 2008, the film wing of LivePlanet was dissolved and Bailey teamed with Disney to form the production banner Ideology Inc, which produced Tron: Legacy, the sequel to the 1982 film Tron. In November 2009, it was announced that Bailey would produce a remake of the 1979 film The Black Hole, which never materialized. He co-wrote (with Ted Griffin) the original screenplay for the 2016 film Solace, starring Anthony Hopkins and Colin Farrell. In January 2010, Bailey was named president of production at Walt Disney Studios, overseeing live-action films produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Touchstone Pictures. Under Bailey, Disney has pursued a tentpole film strategy, which included an expanded slate of large-budget films, including franchise sequels, original films, and live-action adaptations of their animated films. The studio found particular success with the latter type of films, which began with the commercial success of Alice in Wonderland (2010), and continued with Maleficent (2014), Cinderella (2015), The Jungle Book (2016), Pete's Dragon (2016), Beauty and the Beast (2017), Aladdin (2019), and The Lion King (2019), alongside other fairy-tale properties such as Oz The Great and Powerful (2013) and Into the Woods (2014). Other tentpole films including The Lone Ranger (2013), Tomorrowland (2015) and literary adaptations of John Carter (2012), The BFG (2016), and A Wrinkle in Time (2018), became box-office disappointments. Despite the renewed focus on tentpole films, the studio continued to produce smaller, \\"brand-deposit\\" films, such as The Muppets (2011) and Saving Mr. Banks (2013), a period drama which was the first time the studio had depicted its co-founder onscreen.

It consists of musicians from Penang who were popular in their home state earlier on in their career. History There were earlier line-ups of this band but the original line-up mentioned were the ones that took the Alleycats to great height of achievements musically. The Alleycats was always on top of the musical scene in Malaysia even before it was signed up as a recording band. This line-up secured a performance contract in the Mocambo Club situated in Central, a business sector on Hong Kong island in 1976. It was supposed to be a three-month contract but the band's success in wooing the crowd earned it three yearly contracts bundled with TV and concert appearances as means of promoting the band. It became a hit with the locals in Hong Kong. It was not until it left Hong Kong to start a new performance contract in Singapore that the band was spotted by major recording companies. The Alleycats started out in 1978 by signing a contract with Polygram Records-Philips to produce an album. It went to Hong Kong to record its album in Dragon Studio. Later, Lion Studio in Singapore was responsible for mastering the Alleycats' albums. Its first released album was Terima Kasih (Thank You), with their first single Senandung Semalam (Yesterday's Serenade). The existence of this band was vital to the Malaysian music industry. With more than twenty recordings, it had contributed to the development of the Malaysian music industry and is still regarded as one of the legendary Malaysian pop music bands of all time in the country. Despite the changes, the band is still active in performing and recording. The Alleycats have a strong fan base from all walks of life in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. Band members The original members of the band were: *David Arumugam on vocals *Loganathan Arumugam on vocals *Tan Chin Hock on drums *Shunmugam Arumugam on lead guitar *Chester Anthony Passerella on saxophone *Khoo Fook Sin and Grenville Pereira (Gren) on keyboards *Frank Ong on bass guitar. The current members are: *David Arumugam on vocals *Glenville Charles Salay on vocals *Priyadashini Loganathan (also known as Dasha Loga) on vocals *David John on drums, *Nazaruddin Abdullah on lead guitar *Loh Kum Swee (also known as Jimmy Loh) on bass guitar *Prawing Aroonratana (also known as Mike Prawing) on keyboards. Their music is said to be influenced by Air Supply, Phil Collins, Bee Gees, Billy Joel, David Gates & Bread, Santana and Paul McCartney. Most of the Alleycats albums were produced by Eric Yeo. Most of its hit songs were penned by music supremo M. Nasir with the lyrics composed by S.Amin Shahab. The M. Nasir/S.Amin combination were most noticeable on hit songs such as Hingga Akhir Nanti (Till The End), Andai Aku Pergi Dulu (If I Go Before You), Sekuntum Mawar Merah Sebuah Puisi (A Red Rose And A Poem), Setahun Sudah Berlalu (A Year Has Passed), Seribu Bintang (A Thousand Stars), Nota Terakhir (This Last Note). On 27 December 2019, former bass player Frank Ong died of lung cancer aged 54. Death of Loganathan Loganathan Arumugam, a vocalist of the Alleycats, died on 4 June 2007 following an 8-month battle with lung cancer. His death was deeply mourned by Alleycats fans as reported in the press and media. An Alleycats Music Video Competition, held as a tribute to the late Loganathan Arumugam of Alleycats was conducted between 25 June 2006 ‚Äì 25 July 2007. This was jointly organised by NGT Solutions (M) Sdn Bhd and Universal Music Malaysia, with the support from Multimedia Development Corporation (MDeC). It was in line with the government's initiative in encouraging contentpreneurs to develop local content and to be able to identify creativity in the minds of Malaysians. A year after the loss of Loga to lung cancer, the Alleycats was the lead artiste in a concert organised by the Lung Foundation of Malaysia (LFM) to raise money for its activities. Established in November 2005, LFM is a non-profit Foundation geared towards offering support for patients afflicted with lung diseases to enable them to lead a better quality lifestyle with minimal suffering.

He is known for co-founding Facebook, Inc. and serves as its chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder. He also is a co-founder of the solar sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot and serves as one of its board members. Born in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched the Facebook social networking service from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. As of September 2020, Zuckerberg's net worth is $111 billion, making him the 4th-richest person in the world. He is the only person under 40-years-old in Forbes' list of the 20 richest people. Since 2010, Time magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people in the world as a part of its Person of the Year award. In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked 10th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People. Early life Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York. His parents are Karen (n√©e Kempner), a psychiatrist, and Edward Zuckerberg, a dentist. He and his three sisters, Randi, Donna, and Arielle, were brought up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, a small Westchester County village about north of Midtown Manhattan. Zuckerberg was raised in a Reform Jewish household, and his ancestors hailed from Germany, Austria and Poland. He had a Star Wars-themed bar mitzvah when he turned 13. At Ardsley High School, Zuckerberg excelled in classes. After two years, he transferred to the private school Phillips Exeter Academy, where he won prizes in mathematics, astronomy, physics, and classical studies. In his youth, he also attended the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth summer camp. On his college application, Zuckerberg stated that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team. Software developer =Early years= Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. His father taught him Atari BASIC Programming in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at Mercy College near his home while still in high school. In one program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called \\"ZuckNet\\" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a \\"primitive\\" version of AOL's Instant Messenger, which came out the following year. A New Yorker profile said of Zuckerberg: \\"some kids played computer games. Mark created them.\\" Zuckerberg himself recalls this period: \\"I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it.\\" The New Yorker piece noted that Zuckerberg was not, however, a typical \\"geek-klutz\\", as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma. Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a close friend, notes that Zuckerberg was \\"really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff\\", recalling how he once quoted lines from the Roman epic poem Aeneid, by Virgil, during a Facebook product conference. During Zuckerberg's high school years, he worked under the company name Intelligent Media Group to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine. =College years= alt=Mark Zuckerberg with a laptop, facing the camera The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a \\"reputation as a programming prodigy.\\" He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House. In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. According to Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, \\"he built the site for fun.\\" Hasit explains: > We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of > everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and > placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to > the site had to choose who was \\"hotter\\" and according to the votes there > would be a ranking. The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was \\"completely improper.\\" The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched \\"Thefacebook,\\" originally located at thefacebook.com. Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product. The three complained to The Harvard Crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation in response. Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement. The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares. Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete his project. In January 2014, he recalled: > I remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or > two after‚ÄîI opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, > \\"You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world.\\" But I > just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of > what it comes down to is we just cared more. On May 25, 2017, at Harvard's 366th commencement Day, Zuckerberg, after giving a commencement speech, received an honorary degree from Harvard. Career =Facebook= On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room. An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, \\"The Photo Address Book\\", which students referred to as \\"The Facebook\\". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers. Once at college, Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a \\"Harvard thing\\" until Zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate Dustin Moskovitz. They began with Columbia University, New York University, Stanford, Dartmouth, Cornell, University of Pennsylvania, Brown, and Yale. Samyr Laine, a triple jumper representing Haiti at the 2012 Summer Olympics, shared a room with Zuckerberg during Facebook's founding. \\"Mark was clearly on to great things,\\" said Laine, who was Facebook's fourteenth user. Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and some friends moved to Palo Alto, California in Silicon Valley where they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel, who invested in the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California. They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: \\"It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me.\\" He restated these goals to Wired magazine in 2010: \\"The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open.\\" Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie about financing strategies for Facebook. On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark. When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained: > I guess we could ... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with > ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little > less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 > percent taken up with ads ... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we > aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things > running; we are growing at the rate we want to. In 2010, Steven Levy, who wrote the 1984 book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, wrote that Zuckerberg \\"clearly thinks of himself as a hacker\\". Zuckerberg said that \\"it's OK to break things\\" \\"to make them better\\". Facebook instituted \\"hackathons\\" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project. The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg, regularly attended. \\"The idea is that you can build something really good in a night\\", Zuckerberg told Levy. \\"And that's part of the personality of Facebook now ... It's definitely very core to my personality.\\" Vanity Fair magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 \\"most influential people of the Information Age\\". Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the Vanity Fair 100 list in 2009. In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in New Statesmans annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures. In a 2011 interview with PBS shortly after the death of Steve Jobs, Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at Facebook that was \\"focused on building as high quality and good things as you are\\". Zuckerberg and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev during their meeting at the Russian leader's residence outside Moscow, October 1, 2012 On October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg visited Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market. Russia's communications minister tweeted that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away Russian programmers and instead consider opening a research center in Moscow. In 2012, Facebook had roughly 9 million users in Russia, while domestic clone VK had around 34 million. Rebecca Van Dyck, Facebook's head of consumer marketing, claimed that 85 million American Facebook users were exposed to the first day of the Home promotional campaign on April 6, 2013. On August 19, 2013, The Washington Post reported that Zuckerberg's Facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer. At the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt conference, held in September, Zuckerberg stated that he is working towards registering the 5 billion people who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook. Zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the Internet.org project, whereby Facebook, with the support of other technology companies, seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet. Zuckerberg was the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2014, which was attended by 75,000 delegates. Various media sources highlighted the connection between Facebook's focus on mobile technology and Zuckerberg's speech, claiming that mobile represents the future of the company.  Zuckerberg's speech expands upon the goal that he raised at the TechCrunch conference in September 2013, whereby he is working towards expanding Internet coverage into developing countries. Alongside other American technology figures like Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook, Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei, known as the \\"Internet czar\\" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&A; session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in Mandarin Chinese; although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector. Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&A; session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time, because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could \\"learn how to better serve the community\\". Zuckerberg receives a one-dollar salary as CEO of Facebook. In June 2016, Business Insider named Zuckerberg one of the \\"Top 10 Business Visionaries Creating Value for the World\\" along with Elon Musk and Sal Khan, due to the fact that he and his wife \\"pledged to give away 99% of their wealth ‚Äî which is estimated at $55.0 billion.\\" In January 2019, Zuckerberg laid plans to integrate an end-to-end encrypted system for three major social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. On August 14, 2020, Facebook integrated the chat systems for Instagram and Messenger on both iOS and Android devices. The update encouraged cross-communication between Instagram and Facebook users. =Wirehog= A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created by Wayne Chang, was launched. i2hub focused on peer-to-peer file sharing. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called Wirehog, a precursor to Facebook Platform applications. =Platform, Beacon, and Connect= Zuckerberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland (January 2009). On May 24, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Platform, a development platform for programmers to create social applications within Facebook. Within weeks, many applications had been built and some already had millions of users. It grew to more than 800,000 developers around the world building applications for Facebook Platform. On November 6, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Beacon, a social advertising system that enabled people to share information with their Facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites. For example, eBay sellers could let friends know automatically what they have for sale via the Facebook news feed as they listed items for sale. The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users. Zuckerberg and Facebook failed to respond to the concerns quickly, and on December 5, 2007, Zuckerberg wrote a blog post on Facebook, taking responsibility for the concerns about Beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service. In 2007, Zuckerberg was added to MIT Technology Review's TR35 list as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35. On July 23, 2008, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Connect, a version of Facebook Platform for users. =Internet.org= In a public Facebook post, Zuckerberg launched the Internet.org project in late August 2013. He explained that the primary aim of the initiative is to provide Internet access to the five billion people who are not connected as of the launch date. According to Zuckerberg, Internet.org would also create new jobs and open up new markets using a three-tier strategy. He stated in his post: > The world economy is going through a massive transition right now. The > knowledge economy is the future. By bringing everyone online, we'll not only > improve billions of lives, but we'll also improve our own as we benefit from > the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world. Giving everyone the > opportunity to connect is the foundation for enabling the knowledge economy. > It is not the only thing we need to do, but it's a fundamental and necessary > step. Internet.org faced significant opposition in India, where activists said its limited internet ran counter to the idea of net neutrality; Zuckerberg said that a limited internet was better than no internet. Internet.org was shut down in India in February 2016. Zuckerberg later met with Narendra Modi, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai in the San Francisco Bay Area to discuss how to effectively establish affordable internet access in less developed countries. He also changed his Facebook profile picture to extend his support to Digital India to help rural communities stay connected to the internet. =Legal controversies= ConnectU lawsuits Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU). They filed a lawsuit in 2004; it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in federal court in Boston. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash. In November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of 02138, a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni. They included Zuckerberg's Social Security number, his parents' home address, and his girlfriend's address. Facebook filed to have the documents removed; the judge ruled in favor of 02138. Saverin lawsuit A lawsuit filed by Eduardo Saverin against Facebook and Zuckerberg was settled out of court. Though terms of the settlement were sealed, the company affirmed Saverin's title as co- founder of Facebook. Saverin signed a non-disclosure contract after the settlement. Pakistan criminal investigation In June 2010, Pakistani Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes after a \\"Draw Muhammad\\" contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation named the anonymous German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the country's police to contact Interpol to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for blasphemy. On May 19, 2010, Facebook's website was temporarily blocked in Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of May. Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the United Nations General Assembly. Paul Ceglia In June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood pellet fuel company in Allegany County, upstate New York, filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was Facemash, the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name thefacebook.com until January 1, 2004. Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as \\"completely frivolous\\". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement. On October 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested Ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of \\"tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars.\\" Ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and Zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of Facebook, although after examining their emails, investigators found there was no mention of Facebook in them. Some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after Ceglia's arrest. Palestinian terror attacks On July 2, 2016, Israeli cabinet minister Gilad Erdan accused Zuckerberg of having some responsibility for deadly attacks by Palestinians against Israelis. According to him, the social network was not doing enough to ban posts to its platform that incite violence against Israelis. \\"Some of the victims' blood is on Zuckerberg's hands\\", Erdan said. Hawaiian land ownership In January 2017, Zuckerberg filed eight \\"quiet title and partition\\" lawsuits against hundreds of native Hawaiians to purchase small tracts of land which they own. This land is contained within the 700 acres of land in the Hawaiian island of Kauai that Zuckerberg had purchased in 2014. When he learned that Hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other 49 states, he dropped the lawsuits.Mark Zuckerberg hits back at 'misleading' claims he is suing Hawaiian landowners, Wired, January 20, 2017\\"Facebook's Zuckerberg officially drops Hawaii 'quiet title' actions\\", Pacific Business News, February 26, 2017 =Testimony before U.S. Congress= On April 10 and 11, 2018, Zuckerberg began testifying before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation regarding the usage of personal data by Facebook in relation to the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data breach. He has called the whole affair a breach of trust between Aleksandr Kogan, Cambridge Analytica, and Facebook. Zuckerberg has refused requests to appear to give evidence on the matter to a Parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom. On 1 October 2020, the US Senate Commerce Committee unanimously voted to issue subpoenas to the CEOs of top three tech firms, including Facebook‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg, Google‚Äôs Sundar Pichai and Twitter‚Äôs Jack Dorsey. The subpoenas aimed to force the CEOs to testify about the legal immunity the law affords tech platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934. US Republican argued that the law unduly protected social media companies against allegations of anti-conservative censorship. = Breakthrough Starshot = Zuckerberg co-founded and is a board member of the solar sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot. Depictions in media =The Social Network= Jesse Eisenberg (pictured) played Zuckerberg in The Social Network A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, The Social Network was released on October 1, 2010, starring Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, \\"I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive.\\" Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a \\"good guy\\". The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as \\"big juicy fun\\" rather than \\"reportage\\". The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York magazine, \\"I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling\\", adding, \\"What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?\\" Upon winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture on January 16, 2011, producer Scott Rudin thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg \\"for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other.\\" Sorkin, who won for Best Screenplay, retracted some of the impressions given in his script: :I wanted to say to Mark Zuckerberg tonight, if you're watching, Rooney Mara's character makes a prediction at the beginning of the movie. She was wrong. You turned out to be a great entrepreneur, a visionary, and an incredible altruist. On January 29, 2011, Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both said it was the first time they had met. Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, \\"It was interesting.\\" In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explained that he was \\"nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him ...\\" He added, \\"Mark has been so gracious about something that's really so uncomfortable ... The fact that he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It's the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable.\\"\\"Jesse Eisenberg Calls Mark Zuckerberg \\"Sweet\\" and \\"Generous\\" in His Funny Oscar Nominees Lunch Interview\\" Popsugar, February 7, 2011\\"Mark Zuckerberg Meets Jesse Eisenberg On The 'Saturday Night Live' Stage\\" NPR, January 30, 2011 Disputed accuracy Jeff Jarvis, author of the book Public Parts, interviewed Zuckerberg and believed Sorkin made up too much of the story. He stated, \\"That's what the internet is accused of doing, making stuff up, not caring about the facts.\\"Rohrer, Finlo. \\"Is the Facebook movie the truth about Mark Zuckerberg\\" BBC, September 30, 2010 According to David Kirkpatrick, former technology editor at Fortune magazine and author of The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World, (2011),\\"The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World\\", release date February 1, 2011 \\"the film is only \\"40% true ... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie.\\" He says that \\"a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false\\", and concludes that primarily \\"his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the Internet\\". Although the film portrayed Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at Harvard, Zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs. Kirkpatrick agreed that the impression implied by the film is \\"false\\". Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, noted that the \\"image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated ... It is fiction ...\\" He likewise dismissed the film's assertion that he \\"would deliberately betray a friend.\\" =Other depictions= Graffiti depicting Zuckerberg on the Israeli West Bank barrier in Bethlehem, July 2018 Zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of The Simpsons titled \\"Loan-a Lisa\\", which first aired on October 3, 2010. In the episode, Lisa Simpson and her friend Nelson encounter Zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs' convention. Zuckerberg tells Lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful, referencing Bill Gates and Richard Branson as examples. On October 9, 2010, Saturday Night Live lampooned Zuckerberg and Facebook. Andy Samberg played Zuckerberg. The real Zuckerberg was reported to have been amused: \\"I thought this was funny.\\" Stephen Colbert awarded a \\"Medal of Fear\\" to Zuckerberg at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, \\"because he values his privacy much more than he values yours\\". Zuckerberg appears in the climax of the documentary film Terms and Conditions May Apply. (paid) Zuckerberg was parodied in the South Park episode \\"Franchise Prequel\\". On December 7, 2018, Epic Rap Battles of History released a rap battle between Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Philanthropy and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Chan and Zuckerberg in Prague, Czech Republic, 2013 In 2010, Zuckerberg donated an undisclosed amount to Diaspora, an open-source personal Web server that implements a distributed social networking service. He called it a \\"cool idea\\". Zuckerberg founded the Start-up: Education foundation. On September 22, 2010, it was reported that Zuckerberg had donated $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey. Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, \\"The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate.\\" Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously. The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff. On December 9, 2010, Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and investor Warren Buffett signed \\"The Giving Pledge\\", in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50 percent or more of their wealth to charity.  In December 2012, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan announced that over the course of their lives they would give the majority of their wealth to \\"advancing human potential and promoting equality\\" in the spirit of The Giving Pledge.The Giving Pledge website. Retrieved December 3, 2015 On December 19, 2013, Zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million Facebook shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, to be executed by the end of the month‚Äîbased on Facebook's valuation as of then, the shares totaled $990 million in value. On December 31, 2013, the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for 2013.  The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazine's annual list of 50 most generous Americans for 2013, having donated roughly $1 billion to charity. In October 2014, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated US$25 million to combat the Ebola virus disease, specifically the West African Ebola virus epidemic. On December 1, 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan pledged to transfer 99% of their Facebook shares, then valued at US$45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, their new organization that will focus on health and education. The funds will not be transferred immediately, but over the course of their lives. Instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to, as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and other billionaires have done, Zuckerberg and Chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company (LLC). Some journalists and academics have said the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative conducts philanthrocapitalism. In 2016, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave $600 million to create the tax-exempt charity Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, a collaborative research space in San Francisco's Mission Bay District near the University of California, San Francisco, with the intent to foster interaction and collaboration between scientists at UCSF, University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University. Intellectual property generated would be jointly owned by Biohub and the discoverer's home institution. Unlike foundations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which open up all research funded to unrestricted access and reuse by the public, Biohub retains the right to commercialize any research it funds. Inventors will have the option of making their discoveries open-source, with permission from Biohub. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Zuckerberg donated $25 million to a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-backed accelerator that is searching for treatments for the disease. He also announced $25 million in grants to support local journalism that was impacted by the pandemic and $75 million in advertisement purchases in local newspapers by Facebook, Inc., where Facebook will market itself.https://www.axios.com/mark-zuckerberg- facebook-local-news-coronavirus-41b7e6ee-2a19-4d51-b05f-1ff3980d6948.html Politics Zuckerberg listening to President Barack Obama before a private meeting where Obama dined with technology business leaders in Woodside, California, February 17, 2011. In 2002, Zuckerberg registered to vote in Westchester County, New York, where he grew up, but did not cast a ballot until November 2008. Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters Spokeswoman, Elma Rosas, told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg is listed as \\"no preference\\" on voter rolls, and he voted in at least two of the past three general elections, in 2008 and 2012. Zuckerberg has never revealed his own political views: some news outlets consider him to be a conservative, while others consider him liberal. On February 13, 2013, Zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Zuckerberg's particular interest on this occasion was education reform, and Christie's education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools. Later that year, Zuckerberg hosted a campaign fundraiser for Newark mayor Cory Booker, who was running in the 2013 New Jersey special Senate election. In September 2010, with the support of Governor Chris Christie, Booker obtained a US$100 million pledge from Zuckerberg to Newark Public Schools.Christine Richard, \\"Ackman Cash for Booker Brings $240 Million Aid From Wall Street\\", Bloomberg, October 28, 2010 In December 2012, Zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas. Zuckerberg with Argentine President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, 2015 On April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led the launch of a 501(c)(4) lobbying group called FWD.us. The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, a close friend of Zuckerberg. The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the United States, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public, yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either pull their Facebook ad buys or not buy Facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of Zuckerberg ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline, and in opposition to Obamacare among Republican United States senators who back immigration reform. A media report on June 20, 2013 revealed that Zuckerberg actively engaged with Facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a FWD.us video. In response to a claim that the FWD.us organization is \\"just about tech wanting to hire more people\\", the Internet entrepreneur replied: \\"The bigger problem we're trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly.\\" In June 2013, Zuckerberg joined Facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration. The company first participated in the event in 2011, with 70 employees, and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march. The 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional. Zuckerberg and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, 2016 When questioned about the mid-2013 PRISM scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013, Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government \\"blew it.\\" He further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies. Zuckerberg placed a statement on his Facebook wall on December 9, 2015 which said that he wants \\"to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world\\" in response to the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2015 San Bernardino attack. The statement also said that Muslims are \\"always welcome\\" on Facebook, and that his position was a result of the fact that \\"as a Jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities.\\" On February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten \\"Black Lives Matter\\" phrases on the company walls and had written \\"All Lives Matter\\" in their place.

If the borrower defaults, the lender can seize and sell the collateral, but if the collateral sells for less than the debt, the lender cannot seek that deficiency balance from the borrower‚Äîits recovery is limited only to the value of the collateral. Thus, nonrecourse debt is typically limited to 50% or 60% loan-to-value ratios, so that the property itself provides \\"overcollateralization\\" of the loan. The incentives for the parties are at an intermediate position between those of a full recourse secured loan and a totally unsecured loan. While the borrower is in first loss position, the lender also assumes significant risk, so the lender must underwrite the loan with much more care than in a full recourse loan. This typically requires that the lender have significant domain expertise and financial modeling expertise.  Consumer finance  In Europe, mortgage loans secured by personal residences are usually recourse loans. Most states in the United States also permit recourse for residential mortgages, but antideficiency statutes in a minority of states require nonrecourse mortgages. Around 13 states can be classified as nonrecourse states, depending on a researcher's classification standards.Ghent, Andra C. and Kudlyak, Marianna, \\"Recourse and Residential Mortgage Default: Theory and Evidence from U.S. States\\" (July 10, 2009). Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Working Paper No. 09-10. The authors classify eleven states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin) as nonrecourse. The authors also discuss the reasoning for this classification on a state-by-state basis. In several of the nonrecourse states some form of recourse is available but impractical due to lengthy and expensive judicial proceedings, jury trials, and extended redemption periods. The Connecticut Office of Legislative Research, relying on data from the National Consumer Law Center, concluded that at least 10 states can be generally classified as nonrecourse for residential mortgages. Self-directed IRA investors who choose to purchase investment real estate are able to leverage their purchase with a nonrecourse loan. Due to Internal Revenue Service regulations, it would be deemed a violation of the qualified retirement account status to personally guarantee any loan on real estate owned by a self-directed IRA. A property assessed clean energy (PACE) loan, used by some states to fund residential energy improvements, is an example of a loan that is nonrecourse to the borrower.  Commercial lending  Nonrecourse debt is typically used to finance commercial real estate, shipping, or other projects with high capital expenditures, long loan periods, and uncertain revenue streams. It is also commonly used for stock loans and other securities-collateralized lending structures. Since most commercial real estate is owned in a partnership structure (or similar tax pass-through), nonrecourse borrowing gives the real estate owner the tax benefits of a tax-pass-through partnership structure (that is, loss pass- through and no double taxation), and simultaneously limits personal liability to the value of the investment. A nonrecourse debt of $30 billion was issued to JPMorgan Chase by the Federal Reserve in order to purchase Bear Stearns on March 16, 2008. The nonrecourse loan was issued with Bear Stearns's less liquid assets as collateral, meaning that the Federal Reserve will absorb the loss should the value of those assets be below their collateralized value. The legal financing industry provides nonrecourse financial products used to provide financial assistance to plaintiffs involved in a contingency-based lawsuit like a car accident. The funds are provided to the consumer on the potential settlement amount. This money is true nonrecourse funding, if the case is lost, one does not owe the company funding the lawsuit anything. This is a purchase of an asset and not a loan.  Characterization in corporate finance  Nonrecourse debt is usually carried on a debtor company's balance sheet as a liability, and the collateral is carried as an asset. For U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the interaction among the concepts of (1) the \\"amount realized\\" upon a disposition, (2) the amount of nonrecourse debt, and (3) the amount of adjusted basis in the property is fairly complex. The tax consequences of a disposition depend on whether the taxpayer acquired the property with the nonrecourse debt already attached, or whether the taxpayer took out the nonrecourse debt after acquisition of the property, and the relative relationships between fair market value and purchase price and disposition price. Upon a sale or other disposition of property under U.S. income tax law, a taxable gain generally results where the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition of property exceeds the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted basis in that property. Generally, the amount realized is the amount of cash and other consideration received by the taxpayer. The amount of any loan forgiven or discharged is generally part of that consideration.\\"Determination of amount and recognition of gain or loss\\", Taxalmanac.com. The adjusted basis is the sum of the following: * The amount of the original cost incurred by the taxpayer when the property was acquired, including the amount of any nonrecourse debt assumed by the owner/taxpayer as part of the acquisition (also known as \\"original basis\\"), * Plus the costs of improvements (if any) made by the taxpayer to the property, * Less the amount of depreciation (or similar) deductions allowed (or allowable) to the taxpayer on that property. If the amount realized exceeds the amount of adjusted basis, the taxpayer has realized a gain at the time of disposition. If the adjusted basis exceeds the amount realized, a loss has been incurred.Discharge of liabilities The federal income tax effect of nonrecourse debt may be explained by first considering the tax effect of a disposition involving recourse debt (that is, a debt in which the property provides first security coverage, and the borrower/taxpayer is personally liable for any deficiency that may remain after the lender forecloses against the property), and then contrasting against similar facts involving nonrecourse debt, as follows: As an example, suppose: # The unpaid principal of the recourse debt is $100,000; # The fair market value of the property is $80,000; # The taxpayer's adjusted basis in the property is $45,000. Assuming that the creditor forecloses on the property and that the $20,000 excess of the debt over the property's fair market value ($100,000 less $80,000) is contractually discharged (for didactic symmetry with the nonrecourse example, let's assume, contrary to the commercial point of a recourse loan, that the debt is outright forgiven by the creditor, with no actual payment), the taxpayer would realize the $20,000 amount as income from the discharge of indebtedness. That $20,000 of forgiveness would be taxable to the taxpayer as ordinary income even though the taxpayer received no cash at the time of the discharge.Unless the $20,000 qualifies as being excludable under . The $35,000 excess of the fair market value over the adjusted basis ($80,000 less $45,000) would be treated as a taxable capital gain on the \\"sale or other disposition\\" of the property‚Äîagain, even though the taxpayer received no cash at the time of the foreclosure. Assuming the same facts except that the debt is nonrecourse, the result would be quite different. The taxpayer would realize zero taxable ordinary income from the discharge of debt. Instead, the entire $55,000 difference between the unpaid principal of the debt and the taxpayer's adjusted basis ($100,000 less $45,000) would be treated as a taxable capital gain on the \\"sale or other disposition\\" of the property‚Äîagain, even though no cash is received by the taxpayer at the time of foreclosure.Commissioner v. Tufts, 461 U.S. 300 (1983); Crane v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 331 U.S. 1 (1947). At the sale, foreclosure or other disposition, nonrecourse debt incurred as part of the financing of the acquisition, and money extracted from an investment by mortgaging out, are treated the same: both are taxable realization only at the time of the property's disposition,Estate of Levine v. Commissioner, 72 T.C. 780, 792 (1979), aff'd, 634 F.2d 12 (1980) (a \\"nonrecourse mortgage debt is a debt of the property owner since he is, in reality, a quasi-obligor on the debt, notwithstanding the fact that the debt is owed by the property.\\"); Woodsam Associates, Inc. v. Commissioner, 16 T.C. 649 (1951), aff'd, 198 F.2d 357 (2d Cir. 1952) (the excess of the amount of the debt over the adjusted basis of the property is gain, and will be treated as capital gain, subject to the rules on depreciation recapture). even if, at time of disposition, the property is worth less than the amount of the mortgage. Nonrecourse debt that is in place at the time of acquisition of the property is included in basis, Crane v. Commissioner,Crane v.

Marie's Highland Broadcasting as an AM station, broadcasting at 1240 kHz on the AM dial. The station aired a mixture of original programming and simulcasting of the Sault station CJIC and was a CBC Radio affiliate until 1985. In 1976, an ownership shuffle in the Sault gave CJWA to Huron Broadcasting, which converted the station's simulcast source to its own CKCY. In 1985, CKCY and CJWA were acquired by CKCY 920 Ltd.,Decision CRTC 85-67 who again changed the station's simulcasting source, this time to CKCY's sister station CJQM.

In January 1950, \\"Central Provinces and Berar\\" province was renamed Madhya Pradesh state. After November 2000, Korea and the former princely state of Changbhakar became Koriya district of Chhattisgarh state. Korea had an area of 1,631 sq. miles and a population of 126,874 as of 1941. Location The state of Korea, which included 400 villages, was in what is now Chhattisgarh state. It bordered Rewa to the north and also to the southwest; Surguja State to the east; the British district of Bilaspur (Central Provinces) to the south; and Changbhakar State to the west. History Korea State was founded in the 17th century. The ruling family of Koriya were Rajputs of the Balendu Rajvanshi dynasty who came to Koriya from Rajputana in the 13th century and conquered the country. Before the coming of the Marathas, it is alleged that the rajas of Koriya \\"lived in perfect independence, and never having been necessitated to submit to the payment of any tribute, they had no occasion to oppress their subjects.\\" This situation changed in 1790 when Korea had to pay tribute to the Marathas. Historically Korea State also seems to have had some indefinite feudal relations with Surguja, but the British government ignored this claim when Koriya was ceded to them by the Bhonsle Raja of Nagpur in 1818. On 24 Dec 1819 the state became a British protectorate. Upon the extinction of the direct line in 1897, a distant collateral branch of the ruling family was recognized as successor by the British Raj.‡§°‡§º‡§æ.‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§Ö‡§≤‡§Ç‡§ó-‡§õ‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä‡§∏‡§ó‡§¢‡§º ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§®‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Å/Tribes ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Å/Castes (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§™‡§¨‡•ç‡§≤‡•Ä‡§ï‡•á‡§∂‡§®, ‡§¶‡§ø‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡•Ä) In 1891, the Raj decided that the five states of the Surguja group (Surguja, Udaipur, Jashpur, Korea, and Changbhakar), as well as the states of Bonai, Gangpur, Seraikela, and Kharsawan, formerly known as the Tributary Mahals of Chhota Nagpur, were not part of British India, and revised sanads were issued in 1899 formally recognizing them as feudatory states and defining their relations with the British Raj.‡§°‡§º‡§æ.‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§Ö‡§≤‡§Ç‡§ó-‡§õ‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä‡§∏‡§ó‡§¢‡§º ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∏‡§§‡•á‡§Ç ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Å (‡§µ‡•à‡§≠‡§µ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡§æ‡§∂‡§®, ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§™‡•Å‡§∞) Rulers The rulers of the state have apparently always held the title of 'Raja' and were so recognized by the British as early as 1819.Princely States of India =Rajas= *.... - ....

This is a mathematical model designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, project, or any other investment. Typically, then, financial modeling is understood to mean an exercise in either asset pricing or corporate finance, of a quantitative nature. It is about translating a set of hypotheses about the behavior of markets or agents into numerical predictions. At the same time, \\"financial modeling\\" is a general term that means different things to different users; the reference usually relates either to accounting and corporate finance applications or to quantitative finance applications. While there has been some debate in the industry as to the nature of financial modeling‚Äîwhether it is a tradecraft, such as welding, or a science‚Äîthe task of financial modeling has been gaining acceptance and rigor over the years.Nick Crawley (2010). Which industry sector would benefit the most from improved financial modeling standards?, fimodo.com. Accounting In corporate finance and the accounting profession, financial modeling typically entails financial statement forecasting; usually the preparation of detailed company-specific models used for decision making purposes and financial analysis. Applications include: *Business valuation, especially discounted cash flow, but including other valuation approaches *Scenario planning and management decision making (\\"what is\\"; \\"what if\\"; \\"what has to be done\\" ¬ß39 \\"Corporate Planning Models\\". See also, ¬ß294 \\"Simulation Model\\".) *Capital budgeting, including cost of capital (i.e. WACC) calculations *Financial statement analysis / ratio analysis (including of operating- and finance leases, and R&D;) *Project finance modeling *Cash flow forecasting and ALM-related *Credit decisioning: Credit analysis and Consumer credit risk; impairment- and provision-modelling *Working capital- and treasury management *Management accounting: Activity-based costing, Profitability analysis, Cost analysis To generalize as to the nature of these models: firstly, as they are built around financial statements, calculations and outputs are monthly, quarterly or annual; secondly, the inputs take the form of \\"assumptions\\", where the analyst specifies the values that will apply in each period for external / global variables (exchange rates, tax percentage, etc....; may be thought of as the model parameters), and for internal / company specific variables (wages, unit costs, etc....). Correspondingly, both characteristics are reflected (at least implicitly) in the mathematical form of these models: firstly, the models are in discrete time; secondly, they are deterministic. For discussion of the issues that may arise, see below; for discussion as to more sophisticated approaches sometimes employed, see and . Modelers are often designated \\"financial analyst\\" (and are sometimes referred to (tongue in cheek) as \\"number crunchers\\"). Typically, the modeler will have completed an MBA or MSF with (optional) coursework in \\"financial modeling\\". Accounting qualifications and finance certifications such as the CIIA and CFA generally do not provide direct or explicit training in modeling. At the same time, numerous commercial training courses are offered, both through universities and privately. For the components and steps of business modeling here, see the list for \\"Equity valuation\\" under ; see also for further discussion and considerations. Although purpose-built business software does exist (see also Fundamental Analysis Software), the vast proportion of the market is spreadsheet-based; this is largely since the models are almost always company-specific. Also, analysts will each have their own criteria and methods for financial modeling.See for example, Valuing Companies by Cash Flow Discounting: Ten Methods and Nine Theories, Pablo Fernandez: University of Navarra - IESE Business School Microsoft Excel now has by far the dominant position, having overtaken Lotus 1-2-3 in the 1990s. Spreadsheet-based modelling can have its own problems,Danielle Stein Fairhurst (2009). Six reasons your spreadsheet is NOT a financial model , fimodo.com and several standardizations and \\"best practices\\" have been proposed.Best Practice, European Spreadsheet Risks Interest Group \\"Spreadsheet risk\\" is increasingly studied and managed; see model audit. One critique here, is that model outputs, i.e. line items, often inhere \\"unrealistic implicit assumptions\\" and \\"internal inconsistencies\\". (For example, a forecast for growth in revenue but without corresponding increases in working capital, fixed assets and the associated financing, may imbed unrealistic assumptions about asset turnover, leverage and/or equity financing. See .) What is required, but often lacking, is that all key elements are explicitly and consistently forecasted. Related to this, is that modellers often additionally \\"fail to identify crucial assumptions\\" relating to inputs, \\"and to explore what can go wrong\\". Here, in general, modellers \\"use point values and simple arithmetic instead of probability distributions and statistical measures\\"Peter Coffee (2004). Spreadsheets: 25 Years in a Cell, eWeek. ‚Äî i.e., as mentioned, the problems are treated as deterministic in nature ‚Äî and thus calculate a single value for the asset or project, but without providing information on the range, variance and sensitivity of outcomes.Prof. Aswath Damodaran.

Quantitative finance In quantitative finance, financial modeling entails the development of a sophisticated mathematical model. Models here deal with asset prices, market movements, portfolio returns and the like. A general distinction is between: \\"quantitative financial management\\", models of the financial situation of a large, complex firm; \\"quantitative asset pricing\\", models of the returns of different stocks; \\"financial engineering\\", models of the price or returns of derivative securities; \\"quantitative corporate finance\\", models of the firm's financial decisions. Relatedly, applications include: *Option pricing and calculation of their \\"Greeks\\" *Other derivatives, especially interest rate derivatives, credit derivatives and exotic derivatives *Modeling the term structure of interest rates (bootstrapping / multi-curves, short rate models, HJM) and credit spreads *Credit scoring and provisioning *Corporate financing activity prediction problems *Portfolio optimization *Real options *Risk modeling (Financial risk modeling) and value at risk *Dynamic financial analysis (DFA) *Credit valuation adjustment, CVA, as well as the various XVA *Unemployment Insurance Benefit Financing Model (UIBFM) These problems are generally stochastic and continuous in nature, and models here thus require complex algorithms, entailing computer simulation, advanced numerical methods (such as numerical differential equations, numerical linear algebra, dynamic programming) and/or the development of optimization models. The general nature of these problems is discussed under , while specific techniques are listed under . For further discussion here see also: Financial models with long- tailed distributions and volatility clustering; Brownian model of financial markets; Martingale pricing; Extreme value theory; Historical simulation (finance). Modellers are generally referred to as \\"quants\\" (quantitative analysts), and typically have advanced (Ph.D. level) backgrounds in quantitative disciplines such as statistics, physics, engineering, computer science, mathematics or operations research. Alternatively, or in addition to their quantitative background, they complete a finance masters with a quantitative orientation,Mark S. Joshi, On Becoming a Quant. such as the Master of Quantitative Finance, or the more specialized Master of Computational Finance or Master of Financial Engineering; the CQF is increasingly common. Although spreadsheets are widely used here also (almost always requiring extensive VBA); custom C++, Fortran or Python, or numerical analysis software such as MATLAB, are often preferred, particularly where stability or speed is a concern. MATLAB is often used at the research or prototyping stage because of its intuitive programming, graphical and debugging tools, but C++/Fortran are preferred for conceptually simple but high computational-cost applications where MATLAB is too slow; Python is increasingly used due to its simplicity and large standard library. Additionally, for many (of the standard) derivative and portfolio applications, commercial software is available, and the choice as to whether the model is to be developed in-house, or whether existing products are to be deployed, will depend on the problem in question. The complexity of these models may result in incorrect pricing or hedging or both. This Model risk is the subject of ongoing research by finance academics, and is a topic of great, and growing, interest in the risk management arena.Riccardo Rebonato (N.D.). Theory and Practice of Model Risk Management. Criticism of the discipline (often preceding the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 by several years) emphasizes the differences between the mathematical and physical sciences, and finance, and the resultant caution to be applied by modelers, and by traders and risk managers using their models. Notable here are Emanuel Derman and Paul Wilmott, authors of the Financial Modelers' Manifesto. Some go further and question whether mathematical- and statistical modeling may be applied to finance at all, at least with the assumptions usually made (for options; for portfolios). In fact, these may go so far as to question the \\"empirical and scientific validity... of modern financial theory\\".http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/Triana-fwd.pdf Notable here are Nassim Taleb and Benoit Mandelbrot.

Grab a Kimono\\", The New York Times, January 30, 2011. In 1968, the play was adapted by Williams into the film Boom!, co-starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and directed by Joseph Losey. The film was a disastrous vehicle for both stars.  Synopsis  The play is set in Italy and centers on a dying, wealthy woman, Mrs. Flora Goforth, who catches a young man, Christopher Flanders, allegedly trespassing on her estate. Dialogue between the two makes up much of the play. As a character, Mrs. Goforth is in a position where under the traditions of classic drama she could be a Stoic, but she deliberately rejects the consolations of philosophy and chooses, instead, to affirm eroticism and mysticism. Mrs. Goforth dies at the end of the play after making these affirmations as her definitive statement about Life.Taubman, Howard. \\"Tennessee Williams's 'Milk Train. The New York Times.

Hopes played domestic cricket for Queensland, and had represented Australia in One Day International and Twenty20 cricket. Domestic career Hopes was earmarked for higher honours in national youth teams but took a few years to settle once graduating to the first-class level. He played as a 13-year-old in the state's under-age sides before progressing to the Australian Under-19 team - he scored 105, 71 and 51 at the 1998 Youth World Cup. Hopes played for Australia's Under-19s side as a batsman but as his career has progressed he has become more of a bowling all-rounder. Hopes made his Queensland debut in 2001. He has five Pura Cup centuries for Queensland and two one-day hundreds, but is also a successful bowler. In the domestic competition in 2005/06, he collected 15 wickets at 18.33 in the ING Cup and 16 at 22.56 in the Pura Cup, however he was unable to transfer his regular success into the international arena. He had opened innings for Queensland in 2006/07 scoring 553 runs and taking 21 wickets in the Pura Cup, and capturing a season-high 20 victims and a first one-day century in the FR Cup. The IPL franchise King's XI Punjab picked him up and he was a fine contributor in the opening season, but missed the second event to rest an injury, and was hurt in the lead-up to the third tournament. In 2010/11, he was handed the state captaincy replacing Chris Simpson. He was named Sheffield Shield Player of the Series for the 2010/11 series. He became 49th captain of the state. In November 2010, Hopes picked up 3 for 40 and then top scored with 73 as the Bulls pushed well past Tasmania's disappointing 196 on the second day at Bellerive Oval. In December 2010, he took-up coaching role of Queensland as caretaker coach began with a victory after he replaced Trevor Barsby on a sensational day for the Bulls where they bowled out Western Australia on 136 and won the match by 76 runs. In Big Bash match against Tasmania, he scored unbeaten 65 runs and also affected a run-out and took a one-handed catch to dismiss Ryan ten Doeschate was declared the Man-of-the-Match. In Big Bash match against New South Wales, he scored unbeaten 62 runs 38 balls and the set match off the very first ball when James Hopes bowled Usman Khawaja who chopped a pull back onto his stumps. In 2011, an allround performance from Hopes led Queensland to a comfortable six-wicket victory against New South Wales in Ryobi Cup. Hopes provided a solid start with 41 off 56 deliveries before this he took 4 wickets for 16 runs. Hopes took six-wicket haul and ensured that Queensland finished in third place on the 2010/11 Sheffield Shield table with victory by an innings and three runs over Victoria. Hopes was named the Sheffield Shield Player of the Series for 2010/11 at the State Cricket Awards in Hobart. Hopes finished season with averaged of 58.70 with the bat and 20.11 with the ball winning 23 votes won the award ahead of Tasmania allrounder Luke Butterworth. In 2011 Big Bash League, Hopes was signed with the Brisbane Heat. At the end of Queensland's 2016/17 Australian domestic season, Hopes retired from all cricket. International career thumb He made eight ODI appearances in 2004/05. He did not take more than a wicket in a match although his batting showed promise with a top score of 43 against Sri Lanka. Hopes was dropped from the squad at the end of the VB Series and missed the tour to South Africa, but when Shane Watson suffered a calf problem in Bangladesh he was replaced by his Queensland teammate. Despite the late-season promotion, Hopes was cut from the national contract list and told to re-impress in interstate competition. When another Watson injury occurred Hopes was put on World Cup standby before regaining his Cricket Australia deal. Hopes' most productive day at elite level came in 2010 when his 5 for 14 ensured Australia would not be embarrassed by Ireland in an ODI in Dublin. The career-best figures were a deserved reward for a low-key player who pops in to deliver handy overs or scramble late runs. His 57 off 26 balls against West Indies at MCG was one of three career half-centuries, coming after he had been an ODI fixture for most of 2009. In 31 matches he scored 501 runs at 25 and added 27 wickets. In 2007/08, he experienced a busy campaign with 24 ODIs as he took part in all of Australia's one-day series. In March 2008, Hopes scored his maiden ODI half century during his 28th match, scoring 63 off 80 balls against India in the 2nd final of the 2007/08 Commonwealth Bank Series. His effort though was in vain as India went on to win the game and the series.

He was headmaster of Taunton School (1966‚Äì1970) and then Head Master of Westminster School (1970‚Äì1986). In 1986 he became head of the Laura Ashley Foundation and was on the Board of The Observer newspaper from 1986 to 1993. In 1989 he became executive chairman of the Portman Group. Education Rae was educated at Bishop Stortford College, an independent school in Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire, and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. Westminster School Rae became Headmaster of Westminster School, an independent school in Central London, in 1970. During his time there he became a prominent and oft-heard voice on educational questions in the British media. He modernised the school and rescued it from its perilous financial position. To do this, he cut staffing and moved the science department from its cramped building to a modern building within easy reach of the school. During his time at the school girls first became full-time members of the school, in 1973. In 1976 a new day house, Dryden's, was created. It is located next to Wren's and under College, just off Little Dean's Yard. In 1981 to cope with the increased numbers of girls a new boarding house, Purcell's, was opened located about 200m from Little Dean's Yard. In the same year a new building was bought for the Under School ‚Äì Adrian House in Vincent Square. Although it has been asserted that he was forced to resign because of negative reactions to his wife Daphne Rae publishing, A World Apart in 1983, detailing their joint experiences during their time at Taunton and Harrow, and raising the issue of gay teachers, he remained at the school until 1986. According to his posthumously published diary, his departure was a combination of exceeding the typical term of headmastership (10 years), his opposition to the Assisted Places Scheme, and a desire to find a new challenge. Media appearances During the 1980s, Rae wrote newspaper articles and regularly appeared as a panellist on programmes such as Question Time on BBC 1 and Any Questions on BBC Radio 4, and as an interviewee on Newsnight on BBC 2, in which he often argued for the need for schools to be tolerant and to \\"apply common sense\\" when dealing with minor infractions of the rules or end-of-term 'high jinks', and that a sense of humour was almost a pre-requisite of \\"firm but fair\\" discipline when dealing with teenage pupils, and especially teenage boys.Newsnight, BBC 2, February 1983 He said that drug-taking was entirely unacceptable, but that pupils should only be expelled if they had committed serious offences, such as supplying and/or selling drugs, or had dishonestly claimed to be innocent when given the chance to 'own up'.Question Time, BBC 1, April 1985 He also said that he believed that a co-educational school environment had many merits. He also emphasised that, in his opinion, it was not merely the right of parents to choose to educate their children at independent schools, but also the right of educators not employed by the state to provide education. Works Rae was a prolific writer on education, his works including Letters to Parents, The Public School Revolution, and a professional autobiography, Delusions of Grandeur. His 1960 novel, The Custard Boys, shortlisted for the John Llewellyn Rees Memorial Prize, was adapted to make the 1962 film Reach for Glory, which won a United Nations Award, and again for the 1979 film under the novel's original name. In 1983, he assisted Roland Joffe in the production of the film The Killing Fields, and in 1986 he became head of the Laura Ashley Foundation. He was on the board of The Observer newspaper from 1986 to 1993, and in 1989 became executive chairman of the Portman Group, which advocates responsible drinking. During the 1970s he published a short series of novels for teenagers, borrowing for the purpose the names, and to some extent the characters, of his own children. His edited diaries were published in 2009 as The Old Boys' Network: A Headmaster's Diaries 1979‚Äì1986 (). Commemoration John Rae's ashes lie off the cloisters of Westminster Abbey, near a door from Little Dean's Yard used by Westminster boys when they go \\"Up Abbey\\".

Leech was a Scotsman of Irish descent. In 1916, during World War One, he joined the Royal Navy, where he became naval heavyweight champion. He later worked in mines and as a newsagent, he ran several papers, among them Fighting Call, later incorporating another paper, Freedom. He also ran a radical bookshop, Bakunin Press Bookshop, on Buchanan Street, Glasgow, named after anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. The shop was associated with the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation. Political Activity Leech was turned onto politics primarily through his experiences of the war. His conduit for radicalism was Alex Howie. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, there were attempts to co-ordinate the activities of London Freedom Group, the APCF and the United Socialist Movement which ushered in the creation of Fighting Call, edited by Leech. But a number of disagreements with its secretary Guy Aldred and one of its leading members, Jenny Patrick led to a feud and Leech's departure to the Glasgow Anarchist Communist Federation, later becoming Anarchist Federation of Britain. During this time he worked closely with Vernon Richards' publication - Spain and the World. In 1937 he gave shelter to a number of anarchists of the Schwarzrotgruppe (a group advocating the assassination of Adolf Hitler), fleeing Nazi Germany after a foiled plot to end the F√ºhrer's life. It was Leech's initiative which formed the Glasgow Anarchist-Communist Federation in the same year. War Resistance During the Second World War Frank Leech was one of many Glasgow Anarchists who made attempts to resist various aspects of the war such as conscription. Participation in Air Raid Precautions and compulsory fire-watching schemes was deprecated by Glasgow Anarchists. As British Anarchist Federation member Eddie Fenwick explained when prosecuted for refusing to fire watch at his workplace, since the \\"owners of private property had denied him the elementary rights of man, he was entitled to refuse to protect private property.\\" When Leech was fined for refusing to comply with the fire watching regulations, and then imprisoned after declining to pay, he went on hunger strike in Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow, explaining afterwards that he would not \\"be used by any ruling class in their wars ... I am determined that our dictators will only conscript my dead body. Not whilst there is breath in it will I submit to them.\\" After going without food for 17 days Leech was released when friends paid his fine. In August 1940 four members of the Glasgow Anarchist Federation - James Kennedy, Frank Dorans, Eddie Shaw and Frank Leech - were prosecuted for allegedly inciting people to evade liabilities relating to conscription laid down in the National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939. The basis of the charge was that they had advertised the offer of information and advice for prospective conscientious objectors, and had held mock tribunals to help COs prepare their cases. The four defendants were found not guilty, however, since in the judge's opinion their actions had not amounted to incitement. One of the foremost methods of war resistance advocated by Leech and the APFC was that similar to modern conscientious objector status. Since, however, as a rule, the anti- parliamentarians did not conceal their willingness to fight in the class war, in many cases they failed to satisfy the Tribunals' frequent requirement that applicants should demonstrate conscientious objection to all warfare. Once the process of Tribunal and Appellate Tribunal had been exhausted, unsuccessful COs were required to undergo medical examination before being enlisted. Refusal to submit to examination was a criminal offence. In April 1944 Frank Leech reported that \\"Dozens of our members have served twelve months sentences for refusing M.E. [Medical Examination].\\" Quotations *\\"Did our boys join up to be used against their fellow workers?\\", regarding the use of Scottish soldiers to counter a strike in Glasgow. *\\"We would like to see you forming Committees to prepare for the taking over of the factory and commencing the production of the goods you require.\\", on a strike in 1943-1944, at Barr and Stroud's engineering factory in Glasgow, when 2000 women went on strike, 13 December 1943, in support of a pay demand. He was speaking for the Glasgow Anarchists. *\\"We Glasgow Anarchists issued a leaflet calling workers to resist conscription by a General Strike . . . there was no response. Ever since, in common with other groups and individual workers, we have fallen back on individual resistance.\\", referring of attempts at resisting the Second World War.

It was designed in 1989 by Fung Fung Lee () of Stanford University, and subsequently codified in 1995 into RFC 1843. The HZ, short for Hanzi (), encoding was invented to facilitate the use of Chinese characters through e-mail, which at that time only allowed 7-bit characters. Therefore, in lieu of standard ISO 2022 escape sequences (as in the case of ISO-2022-JP) or 8-bit characters (as in the case of EUC), the HZ code uses only printable, 7-bit characters to represent Chinese characters. It was also popular in USENET networks, which in the late 1980s and early 1990s, generally did not allow transmission of 8-bit characters or escape characters. History HZ superseded the earlier \\"zW\\" encoding, which marked entire lines as being GB2312 text by beginning them with the characters \`zW\`. Structure and use In the HZ encoding system, the character sequences \\"~{\\" and \\"~}\\" act as escape sequences; anything between them is interpreted as Chinese encoded in GB2312 (the most significant bits are ignored). Outside the escape sequences, characters are assumed to be ASCII. An example will help illustrate the relationship between GB2312, EUC-CN, and the HZ code: { border=1 cellpadding=4 style=\\"border-collapse: collapse;\\" + Various forms of the GB2312 code (0xD2BB) for the character \\"‰∏Ä\\" (one) --- !

However, when situations allow, the escape sequences \\"~{\\" and \\"~}\\" sometimes surround characters represented in EUC-CN; this alternative use allows Chinese to be readable either with the help of HZ decoder software, or with a system that understands EUC-CN. Additionally, the specification defines that: * the sequence \\"~~\\" is to be treated as encoding a single ASCII \\"~\\" and, * the character \\"~\\" followed by a newline is to be discarded. However, not all HZ decoders follow these two rules. HZ encoders and decoders The first HZ encoder and decoder were written in 1989 by the code's inventor for the Unix operating system. The program, also for the Unix operating system, was also among the first and one of the most popular HZ decoders. It deviates from the specification in that it will display the escape sequences (i.e., \\"~{\\" and \\"~}\\"), and it does not treat \\"~~\\" and \\"~\\" followed by a newline specially.

Characters included bogans Brett & Craig, Dimitri the dodgy mobile phone dealer, DJ Panfa and Rosso Crowe. Characters * Brett and Craig are bogans that dress badly and speak in very strong Australian ocker accents, who were supposedly from Adelaide, South Australia. Pranks involved these two Aussies in short shorts out in Los Angeles and make the people on the street uncomfortable by saying things such as \\"I bet yous wanna get on this [boat] and have sex, don't you?\\" * Dimitri, (Merrick) an electronics store salesman who offered poor quality goods. This part of the show was shot at Precision Installations in Blakehurst, New South Wales. Dimitri was of Mediterranean heritage and appears to be very temperamental. He regularly misinterprets what other characters say and takes offence presuming they insulted his sister. Immediately thereafter, his aggression turns physical and he generally kicks or punches the air.

BGA is located in Franklin, Tennessee, US. Founded in 1889, the school was originally located in part on the site of the Battle of Franklin in the American Civil War. BGA has two campuses. The Harpeth Campus is located on Franklin Road in the historic Cox House and is home to Grades K-4. The Glen Echo campus is located off Mack Hatcher Parkway and is home to Grades 5-12. History The Cox House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, currently serves as the Battle Ground Academy Lower School. Battle Ground Academy was established in 1889, and it was named for its original location during the Civil War Battle of Franklin.Boyd, Lucas G. \\"Battle Ground Academy.\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, retrieved 2015/03/06. The first campus was erected at the corner of Columbia Avenue and Cleburne Street. S. V. Wall and W. D. Mooney were chosen as the first to lead the new academy. In 1902, the original school building burned at which time the school was relocated to Columbia Avenue in Franklin. BGA was established to educate boys originally and girls began to attend some time later. The school operated as a day school though students came from outside the local area to attend. They boarded in private homes until the first dormitory was built in 1922. At this time, BGA evolved to become a boarding and day school. After the construction of the first dormitory, the decision was made to change to an all-male student body. The departure of the last girl students in 1929 ushered in a half-century when BGA was a boys' school. In the early 1970s, the boarding program was phased out. BGA once again welcomed girls to its student body. At present, the female enrollment accounts for approximately 50 percent of the student body. In 1996, the location of the Battle Ground Academy Upper School changed to the current site on Ernest Rice Lane (off of Mack Hatcher Parkway). In 2003, the Middle School joined the Upper School on the Glen Echo campus. Additionally, in 1998, Battle Ground Academy acquired the former Harpeth Academy. This became the BGA Lower School on Franklin Road. Currently, the school operates with two physical campuses and has three divisions: Lower School, Middle School, and Upper School. Traditions BGA has long-standing traditions including the Honor Code, the Greer and Plato societies, and the \\"Tug\\". George I. Briggs, Headmaster from 1925 through 1944, formed two literary societies at BGA in 1925. One of the aforementioned societies was the Greers (in honor of Greer \\"Daddy\\" Peoples). The other society was the called the Platos in honor of the Greek philosopher. After many years of competition in sports and debates, the Greers and Platos societies engaged in their first tug-of-war in 1935. In the high school \\"Tug\\", a rope is stretched across the Harpeth River with the Greers on one side and the Platos on the other. The senior representative from the team who wins the most points in year-long competition - including a daily assembly trivia question, faculty and student quiz bowl, debate, community service drives, arm wrestling, and others - chooses which side of the river will be their tug-of-war position. Student Honors The BGA Artist Guild was established in 1987 after two senior art students approached the drama and art teachers to request that a group be formed to recognize student achievement in arts. The organization started small and met a couple of times each quarter for fun. As the Guild grew in size and prestige, the group began to have public performances. Guild Night has become a tradition for parents and students each year. The Artist Guild allows BGA to encourage, recognize and nurture excellence in arts.http://www.battlegroundacademy.org/podium/default.aspx?t=22110 Board of Trust Merit Scholarships are provided to some of BGA's most promising incoming freshmen. This scholarship program was established in 2005 to recognize outstanding academic performance. Digamma is an in-school honor society. Members are BGA students who are sophomores, juniors or seniors having a cumulative academic GPA of 3.1. These students have no grade below 87 for the previous semester in any academic subject, have been enrolled in BGA for two full semesters, and have had no honor offenses.

The company's products were built around early Intel and Zilog microprocessors, the S-100 bus and the CP/M and MP/M Operating System software from Digital Research. Micromation's headquarters and manufacturing plant were both located in San Francisco. Unlike other computer companies of the same era, Micromation's products were targeted primarily at business users rather than hobbyists or consumers. The systems could be used to run a wide variety of software applications including the popular WordStar word processing program from Micropro and many other programs available for the CP/M and MP/M operating systems. The company built some of the first multi-user computer systems based on microprocessor technology and supported as many as 16 CRT terminals for users. A unique feature of Micromation systems was that they were also \\"multi-processor\\", meaning that a single system could contain as many as 16 separate CPUs, one for each user. This allowed the system to support multiple users without sacrificing performance. Most other multi-user systems of the day used a single CPU to run applications for multiple users which resulted in lower performance. Micromation built and sold thousands of computer systems in the U.S, Canada, Europe, South America and Australia before going out of business in 1985. Like most of the early microcomputer companies, Micromation was not able to adapt to the changing marketplace following the introduction of the IBM PC in 1981.  History  Micromation Mariner Micromation was founded in 1977 by Ben Cooper, an electronic engineer and former officer in the U.S. Navy. The company's headquarters were located in downtown San Francisco and manufacturing was located in the South of Market area of the city. Micromation's first major product was an S-100 bus floppy disk controller card called the \\"Doubler\\", named for its ability to record information on 8\\" floppy diskettes at twice the bit density previously available, allowing users to store approximately 256 kilobytes of data on each side of an 8\\" diskette instead of 128 kilobytes. While the Doubler board was successful with hobbyists building and supporting their own S-100 computers, Micromation began to focus on building complete S-100 computer systems. The first full system was called the Z-Plus or Z-System, and affectionately become known as \\"The Coffin Computer\\" due its finished wooden sides and elongated shape. Micromation was an early OEM supplier to Zendex Corporation of a single board implementation of the Intel SBC-202 Double Density MMFM Floppy Disk Controller in 1980. This disk controller was the only Multibus-I product made by Micromation. Zendex wholesaled hundreds of the Micromation boards in the Zendex Development Systems and wrote a User Manual and added quality assurance and customer support for retail customers under the Zendex model number ZX-200. Zendex later reverse engineered the product and began second sourcing itself just as Micromation discontinued the product to focus on S-100 systems. The M/System, Mariner and MiSystem models followed, all of which were multi- user, multi-processor business computers which ran a Micromation-modified version of Digital Research's MP/M operating system.

It can be viewed as nitric oxide with one electron removed. This ion is usually obtained as the following salts: NOClO4, NOSO4H (nitrosylsulfuric acid, more descriptively written ONSO3OH) and NOBF4. The ClO and BF salts are slightly soluble in acetonitrile (CH3CN). NOBF4 can be purified by sublimation at 200‚Äì250 ¬∞C and . NO+ is isoelectronic with CO, CN‚àí and N2. It arises via protonation of nitrous acid: :HONO + H+ NO+ + H2O Chemical properties =Hydrolysis= NO+ reacts readily with water to form nitrous acid: : NO+ + H2O ‚Üí HONO + H+ For this reason, nitrosonium compounds must be protected from water or even moist air. With base, the reaction generates nitrite: : NO+ + 2 NaOH ‚Üí NaNO2 + Na+ + H2O =As a diazotizing agent= NO+ reacts with aryl amines, ArNH2, to give diazonium salts, ArN. The resulting diazonium group is easily displaced (unlike the amino group) by a variety of nucleophiles. Reaction of nitrosonium with aniline to form a diazonium salt =As an oxidizing agent= NO+, e.g. as NOBF4, is a strong oxidizing agent: * vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium, [NO]+ in CH2Cl2 solution has a redox potential of 1.00 V (or 1.46‚Äì1.48 V vs SCE), * vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium, [NO]+ in CH3CN solution has a redox potential of 0.87 V vs. (or 1.27‚Äì1.25 V vs SCE). NOBF4 is a convenient oxidant because the byproduct NO is a gas, which can be swept from the reaction using a stream of N2. Upon contact with air, NO forms NO2, which can cause secondary reactions if it is not removed. NO2 is readily detectable by its characteristic orange color. =Nitrosylation of arenes= Electron-rich arenes are nitrosylated using NOBF4.E. Bosch and J. K. Kochi. \\"Direct Nitrosation of Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Ethers with the Electrophilic Nitrosonium Cation\\". Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1994, volume 59, pp. 5573‚Äì5586. One example involves anisole: : CH3OC6H5 + NOBF4 -> CH3OC6H4NO + HBF4 Nitrosonium, NO+, is sometimes confused with nitronium, NO, the active agent in nitrations. These species are quite different, however. Nitronium is a more potent electrophile than is nitrosonium, as anticipated by the fact that the former is derived from a strong acid (nitric acid) and the latter from a weak acid (nitrous acid). =As a source of nitrosyl complexes= NOBF4 reacts with some metal carbonyl complexes to yield related metal nitrosyl complexes.T.

He drummed in various bands in early 1960s such as The Islanders, The Electric Five and Nameless. Gradually Walli switched from drums to electric guitar. After Nameless had split, Walli started as a solo guitarist in The Typhoons. The Typhoons split when its members had to join the obligatory military service. Professional career In spring 1966 Walli launched his professional musical career as guitarist when he started playing with Jormas, a band which was extremely popular not only in Finland but in the rest of Scandinavia too. During the seven months Hasse Walli spent in Jormas, they toured expansively Finland, Sweden and Denmark, Walli also appearing on the band's album and singles. Again, Jormas split too when its members had to join military service; Walli finding soon himself doing a brief stint in The Frankies of Johnny Liebkind. However, soon Hasse Walli became frustrated in having to play soft pop, when the rawer sounds of The Yardbirds and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (which especially inspired Walli) started to make waves in the mid-60s rock scene. With his friend M√•ns Groundstroem, Edward Vesala (who was not to spend a lot of time in the band) and British expatriate Jim Pembroke, Walli initiated a new band dedicated to this sound, which was baptized Blues Section, and which was to become a groundbreaking act in the whole Finnish rock scene. Another great inspiration to Blues Section was the Jimi Hendrix gig in May 1967 at Kulttuuritalo, Helsinki. Blues Section lasted until the late 1968, during which time Walli recorded with the band their seminal eponymous album, several singles, film music and other material later to be heard on various collection albums, and played over 150 live gigs. During this period Walli also played guitar in the jazz band Otto Donner Treatment, the composer-musician Henrik Otto Donner being the essential and extremely innovative producer figure behind Blues Section and their record label Love Records. Hasse Walli playing drums in the 1960s Following the split of Blues Section, Hasse Walli played for some time in the band of light pop singer Tapani Kansa and as a bar musician at the restaurant Fennia. In summer 1969 Walli was planning a new band called Paradise with the former Jormas members Pepe Willberg, Kikke Bergholm and Matti Oiling, which never came into being, though Willberg later on used the name Paradise with his own band. On 31 August 1969 Hasse Walli was involved in a car accident which interrupted his career for a while after when he was returning from a gig. Walli's injured left hand was operated and the guitarist, forced to take a break from playing, spent some time in the bohemian circles of Copenhagen, leading a vagrant life also as a street musician in French Riviera. After returning to Finland, Hasse Walli played for a while with Kirka & D'Islanders, in a band called Zeus producing Vesa-Matti Loiri's first album 4+20 and collaborating with jazz musician Make Lievonen. Hasse Walli Eternal Band was a jazzy project which worked under different line-ups from 1968 to 1971, playing among all at the first Ruisrock festival of Turku in 1970. Other jazz projects of this period where Walli contributed were Irina Milan & Tabu, Simo Big Band, Carita Holmstr√∂m's backing band, Paroni Paakkunainen & Unisono and German Heinz Sauer-G√ºnther Lenz Quintet; furthermore, he played with Edward Vesala and Junnu Aaltonen, also at Afrikan T√§hti band of pop singer Maarit. Walli's Punainen Lanka ensemble where Eija Ahvo and Harri Saksala sang and which explored folk music of Finland and America, was part of 70s leftist political song movement gaining strong foothold in Finland. The band Piirpauke, combining folk music, ethnic sounds (later to be known as world music) to progressive jazz rock, was one of Hasse Walli's best-known musical projects, starting in 1975. The major figure in the band was Sakari Kukko, a multi- instrumentalist playing saxophone, flute and keyboards, who had played with Walli in various ensembles, Kukko-Walli Quartet among them. The best known Piirpauke track is the hypnotic Konevitsan kirkonkellot from the band's eponymous 1975 debut album, based on a traditional Karelian folk song. The band had an enormous live success and Hasse Walli stayed in Piirpauke about three years, later returning to the band for its tours in 1983 and 1994. In the late 1970s Hasse Walli was active in ELMU, a society established in 1978 to propagate live music in a time when disco and recorded music were worryingly diminishing the working opportunities of musicians playing live. This was also the time when Walli got more and more interested in world music. His enthusiasism for reggae started in 1977 after having seen Bob Marley performing live in Stockholm. Hasse Walli had visited a youth festival in Cuba with Punainen Lanka and Sakari Kukko, and he formed in 1979 Hasse Walli Projekti which played Cuban music and reggae rhythms. The first eponymous solo album of Hasse Walli was released in 1981, the year when Walli was also chosen the Musician of the Year by Katso magazine. The next year, when he had his band Hasse Walli All Stars, saw the second album, called Sounds Afro! By this time Walli had seriously gotten into African music, and he dissolved the band and travelled in January 1982 to Dakar, the capital of Senegal, to explore local sounds such as Mbalax, Senegalese pop. Jamming with local musicians at clubs, Walli practiced hard to get into the heart of this musical style quite differing from the Western genres of rock, blues and jazz he had already learned to master. Hasse Walli played with some musicians who had been performing with the legendary Youssou N'Dour. On returning to Finland and enriched by his experiences in Senegal, Walli started a band called Dakar Sound. Afro-Line was another band of Walli he started with Congolese expatriate Marie-Alphonse Liwata, releasing the albums Viva Africa (1983), Dakar Nights (1985) and Close to the Line (1987). During the years 1983‚Äì86 Hasse Walli shuttled between Gambia, Dakar and Finland. By 1988 Walli felt he had finally learned enough to compose and arrange Mbalax music and start an all-African band for this (Walli's earlier Afro bands had mostly consisted of Finnish musicians), and he returned to Dakar for this purpose. Soon got together the new band, called Asamaan, with such musicians as Manel Diop, Yamar Thiam, Aladji Oumar Faye, Omar Cheikh Diene, Pape Sarr and Mousse Gueye. The first Asamaan album Modern Mbalax came out in 1989, receiving excellent reviews in world music circles. Walli and Asamaan played at folk music, jazz and rock festivals, doing also some street performances in Helsinki. Asamaan published two more albums, African Sky (1990) and, with a new line-up, Teranga (1993). Film director Kari Happonen documented Mbalax music scene in Dakar and Asamaan in his 1991 documentary Mbalax! Rytmin l√§hteill√§. Teranga marked the end of Hasse Walli's Afro period. When he returned from Senegal to Finland in June 1993, he thought the time might be now right to return to his 1960s musical roots, and the band Suuret Setelit was launched, playing rock and rhythm & blues. The gigs of Suuret Setelit were eagerly checked by a completely new generation of Hasse Walli fans. Suuret Setelit lasted until 1995, the year Walli also performed together with Remu Aaltonen, the last remaining member of the legendary 70s band Hurriganes. Hasse Walli also played several Back to the 60s type of concerts with some his peers from that period such as Danny; never forgetting his love of African music, either. In recent years Walli has been touring with his current band Hasse Walli Power Trio. Additionally, he has worked with guitarist and singer Steve Webb, and they have released two albums together. Trivia Hasse Walli's younger brother was Petri Walli of Kingston Wall.

Career Cooper started playing rugby with Pencoed before moving to Bath in the West Country. Cooper made his international debut in 2001 against Italy, when many were claiming him to be the successor to Rob Howley. He toured to Japan in later that year. After Howley's retirement in 2002 he was given his first run in the side in 2003, becoming first choice for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. He returned to play in Wales after that tournament with the Celtic Warriors, but he found himself scrapping with the ScarletsDwayne Peel for the scrum half jersey during the 2004 Six Nations. He joined the Newport Gwent Dragons in 2004 when the Celtic Warriors were disbanded, but his form went downhill and Dwayne Peel secured the scrum half shirt with some stunning performances during Wales' Grand Slam in the 2005 Six Nations. Despite playing mostly on the bench for Wales he was selected for the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, but with three other scrum halves on the tour he struggled to get game time as he was last in the pecking order behind Peel, Matt Dawson and Chris Cusiter. With the emergence of Mike Phillips he struggled to fight for his way into the Wales team as he became a distant third choice. He moved to Gloucester in 2007. He made the Wales squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup but still as third choice scrum half and he played just one match as substitute against Japan. He got another chance for Wales on a tour to South Africa in 2008 when Phillips and Peel both were injured. He impressed in two matches against South Africa and kept his place ahead of Peel and the still injured Phillips for the Autumn internationals that year, including a 21‚Äì18 win over Australia. He was injured during the 2009 Six Nations but returned to the Wales side for the summer tour to North America. The tour did not go well and he was replaced at half time by Peel against Canada. He left Gloucester in 2009 after losing his place to Rory Lawson and moved to the Cardiff Blues to replace Jason Spice. He played again for Wales in the 2010 Six Nations against England and Scotland but was replaced by Richie Rees for the remainder of the tournament.

As with RSX-11 and VMS, Dave Cutler was the principal force behind the development of this operating system. Cutler's team developed the product after moving to the Seattle, Washington area to form the DECwest Engineering Group, DEC's first engineering group outside New England. Initial target platforms for VAXELN were the \\"backplane interconnect\\" computers such as the model code-named Scorpio. At the time there were no VAX microcomputers. When VAXELN was well under way, Cutler spearheaded the next project, the MicroVAX I--the first VAX microcomputer. Although it was a low-volume product compared with the New England-developed MicroVAX II, the MicroVAX I demonstrated the set of architectural decisions needed to support a single- board implementation of the VAX computer family, and it also provided a platform for embedded applications written in VAXELN. The VAXELN team made the decision, for the first release, to use the Pascal language as its system programming language. Other languages, including C, were supported in later releases of the system. The small and very focused development team built the first product in approximately 18 months. VAXELN allowed a developer to write a self-contained embedded system application that would run on VAX (and later MicroVAX) hardware with no other operating system present. The system was debuted in Las Vegas in the early 1980s, with a variety of amusing applications written by the development team, ranging from a system that composed and played minuets to a robotic system that played and solved the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Trivia The system was originally supposed to be named ELAN (Executive for Local Area Network), but DEC discovered at the last minute that it was trademarked in a European country where DEC wished to conduct business. The company holding the trademark to ELAN was the Slovenian sports equipment manufacturer Elan. In order to avoid litigation DEC quickly renamed it to VAXELN by dropping the A, much to the disgruntlement of the developers. Some documentation and marketing material had already been printed referring to the product as ELAN, and samples of these posters were prized for many years by members of the original team.

At the , the town had a population of 1,717. Just off the beach is Broulee Island, currently joined to the mainland, but in past years the connecting spit has been covered by water, at times a very deep navigable channel with a strong current. The first harbour in the area south of Batemans Bay was established at Broulee behind what is now known as the island. Although settlement had already commenced on the shores of the nearby Moruya River, it was not easily navigable due to a sandbar at its mouth. History The Broulee area was surveyed and gazetted in 1837 and land sales commenced in 1840. At that time a post office was opened with mail being delivered each week over the mountains from Braidwood. Henry Clarke took up farming in the Broulee area in the 1840s after emigrating from Ireland. The first court in the district was established also in 1840 and in 1841 Broulee was made the centre of a police district which covered the area from Jervis Bay to Eden, New South Wales. In 1841 a flood washed away the sandbar at the mouth of the Moruya River. Land up the river was for sale from 1848 and the Moruya town site surveyed in 1850 and the town gazetted in 1851. That year gold was discovered at Araluen inland from Moruya and near Braidwood. The road from Moruya to Araluen became the preferred route and the functions that had been at Broulee shifted to the growing town of Moruya. In 1859 the court, including the building, was relocated to Moruya. The building of the Erin-go-Bragh Hotel was also shifted from Broulee Island to Campbell St, Moruya. The inn building was first used as a store and later became the storekeeper's home. The building was demolished in 1978 as part of the development of the new Eurobodalla Shire offices. Footings of the inn building can still be seen on the island. Broulee harbour was lost in 1873 as removal of vegetation for an access road on the land spit eroded the spit and isolated what is now known as Broulee Island. In the last decades of the twentieth century, the spit or tombolo has reformed. Landmarks and townships There is a lighthouse on Burrewarra Point to the north of Broulee. Businesses in the town include a pharmacy / doctor / general store / post office / liquor outlet / fuel. There is a take-away food outlet and a real estate agency. The southern beach has a Surf Lifesaving Club with facilities including toilets, accessed from a road below the headland. There is also a boat launching ramp here, but weather conditions need to be right. There is no police station, the closest being Moruya. The Rural Fire Service has a volunteer station. There are a number of schools in the area, the largest being St Peters Anglican college catering for years Kindergarten to Year 12. Tourist attractions From 1972 the island has been managed as the Broulee Island Nature Reserve. There is a modern caravan park with on-site vans and cabins available. Another camping area (basic) is located at the southern end of the South Beach, adjacent to Moruya Airport and Moruya River (boat ramp). There are other accommodation options including a motel, bed and breakfast establishments, and holiday cottages for rent. Activities in the area include surfing, swimming, wind surfing, fishing (beach, rock, estuary, ocean) walks, bicycling. Vehicle touring to nearby scenic beaches and headlands is popular. There are 4WD opportunities in nearby State Forests and National Parks. In recent years, the numbers of visiting whales especially the southern right whale (may rest and stay in the area, sometimes entering into Moruya River) and humpback whale show increase in adjacent waters. Bottlenose dolphins, Australian sea lions, and sea turtles can be observed from shores as well. Mogo is a nearby village with artists, crafts and food, as well as historic Mogo Goldfields and the Mogo Zoo.

The TAC upholds the theological doctrines of the Affirmation of St. Louis. Each of the respective jurisdictions utilizes a traditional Book of Common Prayer deemed free of theological deviation. Most parishioners of these churches would be described as being traditional Prayer Book Anglicans in their theology and liturgical practice. Some Anglo-Catholic parishes use the Anglican Missal in their liturgies. The TAC is governed by a College of Bishops from across the Communion and headed by an elected Primate.The Traditional Anglican Communion Concordat . The TAC was formed in 1991. Archbishop Louis Falk was its first primate. He was succeeded in 2002 by Archbishop John Hepworth of the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia. The current Primate is Archbishop Shane Janzen of the Anglican Catholic Church of Canada. The TAC churches have been formed outside of the Anglican Communion churches over a number of different issues. The principal issue has been the ordination of women. Other issues include liturgical revisions, the acceptance of homosexual activity and the importance of Apostolic tradition within the Church.  History  In 1991, the Traditional Anglican Communion was formed to create a united communion of Continuing Anglican Churches, which originated in the Affirmation of St. Louis, which repudiated the revision of the Book of Common Prayer, in addition to other issues, such as the ordination of women. With the beginning of the 21st century, \\"the communion reported 14 member churches with a total of 300,000 members spread over six continents.\\" In October 2007 the bishops of TAC formally expressed the desire to enter into full unity with the See of Rome without losing core Anglican distinctives.Hepworth, John. \\"Anglican Communion: Rome and the TAC\\" The full petition accepted the ministry of the Bishop of Rome, and the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated, on 5 July 2008, that it was giving serious consideration to the prospect of corporate union with groups of Anglicans and on 29 October 2009 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith announced Pope Benedict XVI's intention to create a new type of ecclesiastical structure,Note of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith About Personal Ordinariates for Anglicans Entering the Catholic Church called a personal ordinariate, for unspecified groups of Anglicans entering into full communion with the See of Rome. On 4 November 2009, Pope Benedict signed the apostolic constitution, Anglicanorum coetibus, which was released on 9 November 2009 and on 3 March 2010, in Orlando, Florida, the eight members of the House of Bishops of the Anglican Church in America ‚Äî the United States branch of the TAC ‚Äî voted unanimously to formally ask the Holy See to be accepted as a personal ordinariate.Campbell, Christian (March 3, 2010). \\"TAC Formally Requets Personal Ordinariate for USA\\".

He is known for designing the first electrically amplified stringed instrument to be marketed commercially. He was also a founder of National Stringed Instrument Corporation and Rickenbacker (originally Rickenbacher) guitars. Biography He was born in Coleman County, Texas on March 18, 1899. Beauchamp performed in vaudeville, playing the violin and the lap steel guitar, before he settled in Los Angeles, California. During the 1920s, he experimented with the creation of electric lap steel guitars, electric guitars, electric bass guitars, electric violins, and instrument amplifiers. In 1931, he joined with Paul Barth and Adolph Rickenbacker to form the Ro-Pat-In Corporation to produce and sell electrified string instruments. The most notable of these, the Rickenbacher A-22 (and A-25) lapsteel guitar - known as the \\"frying pan\\" - is widely regarded as the first mass-produced electric guitar. Production of the instrument began in 1932. In 1937, Beauchamp secured a United States patent for his version of the electric guitar. Beauchamp married Myrtle Johnston in 1917. They had two children, Frances and Nolan. He died of a heart attack in 1941 while deep sea fishing near Los Angeles.

It is a senior rugby club in Dublin, Ireland, playing in Division 1A of the All-Ireland League. History Terenure College RFC was founded on November 14, 1851. With a great love for the game and concerned that past pupils were not playing rugby union after leaving school, Rev. Fr Jackie Corbett, O.Carm., chaired a meeting of rugby playing past pupils of Terenure College in the Hotel Lenehan, Harcourt Street, Dublin. Those present included Johnny Corrigan, Hugh Clarke, Joe Clarke, Sean Ryan, P.P. Maguire, Colm O' Nolan, Niall Thunder, Hugh Milroy, Dick Dunlop, Des Giltrap, Jack Hearne and Dudley Fisher. Terenure Collegians Rugby Football Club was formed. Fr. Corbett was elected first President. J.P. Clarke was elected Hon. Secretary, Johnny Corrigan as Hon. Treasurer and Hugh Milroy as Club Captain. Terenure played their first match shortly afterwards against the Terenure College SCT at the time. The club won 8 points to 3. It took until January 8, 1959 for Terenure to be promoted to a Senior club after fourteen applications to the Leinster Branch, that after winning five Junior 1 titles and many other trophies. Two years later Mick Hipwell was selected to play for Ireland, Terenure's first Irish international. Mick played against England at Twickenham. The years 1965-7 were successful seasons for Terenure under the captaincy of Eddie Coleman (later to be IRFU president), as they won the Leinster Senior league twice in a row. Terenure College RFC has had many players play for Ireland including Mick Hipwell, Brendan Sherry, Paul Haycock, Ciaran Clarke, Niall Hogan, David Corkery, Girvan Dempsey, and Eric Miller. Terenure has also supplied personnel to the Irish team at other levels including Paddy 'Rala' O'Reilly as Baggage Master to the Senior Team and British and Irish Lions (2009 tour to South Africa), Colin Phillips as Baggage Master to the Irish 'A', U21 and U19 Teams and the Japanese Senior Team, Liaison Officer to the Fijian Team on their Autumn Tour '09 and Samoan Team on their Autumn Tour '10, Argentina on their Autumn Tour 2012 Baggage Master/Assistant Manager Irish U20 2011/2012 for both Six Nations and Junior World Cup in Cape Town South Africa and Martin Searson as Baggage Master to U19's. The Club now Leinster have benefited greatly from Terenure's 'rugby factory' with former players such as Girvan Dempsey, David Blaney, Niall Hogan, Mark Egan, James Blaney, David McAllister and Brian Blaney playing for the province. Terenure field the most adult teams in the province of Leinster, with seven adult teams fielded each week. In addition, 450 boys and girls play mini-rugby every Sunday. They have been crowned the best club in d6 west. Terenure College has provided two Presidents of the IRFU - M. H. Carroll (1984‚Äì85) and E. Coleman (2000‚Äì01) and one president of the Leinster Branch - D. Lamont (2009‚Äì2010) Coached by former Munster and Leinster hooker James Blaney and coaches John Coffey and Derm Blaney.

Jones found employment as an engine wiper at the age of 13 with the narrow gauge South Pacific Coast Railroad at Boulder Creek, California. At 17, Jones was promoted to fireman, and later became an engineer. The South Pacific Coast Railroad, which had been acquired by the Southern Pacific Railroad, was converted to a standard gauge road by 1909. Jones was among the first to work the first standard gauge portions of the line out of San Jose, ultimately advancing to the Coast Daylight run between San Francisco and San Luis Obispo. After World War II, he was in charge of the reassembly of the preserved locomotive Gov. Stanford for Stanford University; the locomotive is currently on display at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. Jones married Geraldine McGrady, the schoolteacher at Wright's Station, located south of Los Gatos. After settling down in Los Gatos on a prune orchard known as \\"The Ranch\\", the Jones family grew to include two sons, Robert and Neal, and two daughters, Betty and Geraldine. The Ranch was located at the corner of Daves Avenue and the Santa Clara-Los Gatos Road (today's Winchester Boulevard). Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad The 2-spot on the turn table On the docks of San Francisco in 1939, Jones discovered an gauge steam locomotive built in 1905 and designed to run on the Venice Miniature Railway in Venice Beach, California. He bought the little engine, nicknamed the 2-spot, for $100 and got it running again on a miniature railway he and his railroad buddies constructed on the ranch, dubbed the \\"Wildcat Railroad\\". His only sons Robert and Neal were casualties of World War II, and Jones operated his \\"Wildcat Railroad\\" for the neighborhood children, every Sunday until his death in 1968 in memory of his two lost sons. The railroad attracted people from across the valley and beyond, including Walt Disney, who considered purchasing some of Jones' collection of miniature railway equipment. The two became friends, and Jones was behind the throttle of Disney's narrow gauge locomotives on opening weekend at Disneyland on July 17, 1955. In addition, the Wildcat Railroad's logo, depicting a smiling cartoon wildcat with an engineer's cap, was designed by Disney animator Ward Kimball. Jones retired from the Southern Pacific Company in 1949. In January 1959, it is said Jones ceremoniously ran the last train out of Los Gatos before the rails were taken up throughout the town. Jones died of leukemia in 1968 at the age of 83, and his \\"Wildcat Railroad\\" was purchased by local residents who formed a non-profit organization to relocate and operate it at Oak Meadow Park and Vasona Park in Los Gatos (a plaque on a wall at the corner of Winchester and Daves marks the original location of the railroad). The railroad opened for regular operations in July 1970 after nearly two years of restoration and construction, which included salvaging an Southern Pacific piggyback flatcar from a wreck and using it as a bridge over Los Gatos Creek. In 1972, a extension was built, adding a working grade with a trestle and bringing the railroad into Vasona Park, an extension built following complaints that the ride was too short (the original route simply went around Squirrel Hill and came back, the bridge over the creek being double-tracked so the train could run in both directions to even out the wear on the rails; after the extension, it remained double-tracked until the mid-1990s, when it was single-tracked, and fencing was added between the two pedestrian paths and the tracks). By 1992, the railroad was averaging well over 100,000 riders each year. It was also in 1992 that the railroad acquired its first diesel locomotive. Previously, the railroad had solely operated the steam locomotive that Billy had discovered in San Francisco in 1939. Realizing the need for a larger locomotive fleet, the railroad pursued options to acquire a more reliable diesel locomotive. Local businessman and railroad enthusiast Albert B. Smith purchased a brand new diesel-hydraulic locomotive from Chicago Locomotive WorksLocomotive Works: history, 122/53-60; mention, 8/31 and donated the locomotive to the railroad. Smith died a year later, and the diesel was, in later years, named for him. In 1994, the 2-spot was in need of a new boiler and complete overhaul. In the meantime, the new diesel, dubbed #2502 and painted in the Southern Pacific's Black Widow paint scheme, would serve as the primary locomotive of the railroad for eleven years. After a ten year restoration project, the 2-spot finally returned to service in July 2005. The occasion marked the 100th birthday of the steam locomotive and also celebrated the 35th anniversary of the Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad in Vasona Park Diesel locomotives #3502 and #2502 The railroad purchased another diesel locomotive in 2006 and dubbed it #3502. It wears the colors of the Chicago and North Western Railway. #3502 started construction at the Chicago Locomotive Works, but was finished by the Merrick Light Railway Works after CLW went under (CLW had a history of trying to scam the railroad). 3502 was later named Larry H. Pederson, in honor of a railroad board member. Both diesels, built in the style of an EMD GP60M, continue to operate weekdays during summer and weekends during winter and early spring. A third diesel, #4, built in 2005 by volunteer Tom Waterfall in the style of a Davenport Locomotive Works locomotive, is used in work train service, and also sees use as a yard switcher. The restored 2-spot operates weekends from late spring until the end of fall, with sporadic weekday appearances. In May 2013, the railroad took delivery of a second steam locomotive, #5. The locomotive is a 4-6-2 oil burner built by the Merrick Light Railway Works, which also built 3502. The 5-spot was put in rotation with the 2-spot to avoid having to use 2502 or 3502 when either steam locomotive breaks down. Several local media outlets printed information that the 2-spot would be retired, and the 5-spot would replace her. However, railroad management stated on Facebook that the 2-spot would \\"always be a staple of the railroad\\". #5 is identical to locomotive #1919, which operates at the Little Amerricka Amusement Park in Marshall, Wisconsin, the only difference being that #1919 runs on a gauge two inches narrower than the BJWRR. The railroad had owned another steam locomotive, #3, a 2-6-0 oil burner that had operated on the Venice Miniature Railway with #2, before operating at the Eastlake Park Scenic Railway as #1903. The locomotive was planned to be restored to operation, but was eventually sold to volunteer Ken Middlebrook when it was determined that the 3-spot was too small to handle the trains. In its place, the railroad opted to commission Merrick to build the more powerful #5. Middlebrook is currently restoring the locomotive. The railroad owns five open-air passenger cars, four of which came from Billy Jones' ranch, and a special handicap car for wheelchair passengers. Each of the regular cars can seat up to 24 passengers, while the handicap car can seat up to three wheelchairs or roughly 12 passengers. A train composed of all five cars can carry 108 passengers. This can create capacity issues on the railroad's busiest days. To alleviate this issue, the railroad commenced construction on a fifth regular car, which is slightly different in construction, using modular seats for easier cleaning. Because the original car drawings are lost, the railroad had to resort to reverse-engineering one of the existing cars. The car, named LIVE OAK, entered revenue service on December 10, 2016. A full six-car train can seat up to 132 passengers at once, 120 if the handicap car is not used. In addition to the passenger cars, the railroad also owns a utility flat and a ballast hopper for work trains, plus three flatcars donated to the railroad in 2015, one of which recently had a pair of couplers attached. A self-propelled motorcar affectionately known as the \\"Putt-Putt\\" was used as a weedspraying car until it was scrapped sometime in 2012 for being unsafe, as well as the city forbidding the use of conventional weedspray in Vasona Park, forcing the railroad to use its own blend, as well as pull weeds by hand. Historic Savage carousel The Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad also operates a historic Savage carousel named after one of the organization's founders, William \\"Bill\\" Mason. The carousel is located next to the railroad's depot in Oak Meadow Park and has its own unique history, having taken part in the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco.

It is often found as the dihydrate, Na2MoO4¬∑2H2O. The molybdate(VI) anion is tetrahedral. Two sodium cations coordinate with every one anion.Braithwaite, E.R.; Haber, J. Molybdenum: An outline of its Chemistry and Uses. 1994. Elsevier Science B.V. Amsterdam, The Netherlands. History Sodium molybdate was first synthesized by the method of hydration.Spitsyn, Vikt.

The anhydrous salt is prepared by heating to 100 ¬∞C. :MoO3 + 2NaOH + H2O ‚Üí Na2MoO4*2H2O Uses The agriculture industry uses 1 million pounds per year as a fertilizer. In particular, its use has been suggested for treatment of whiptail in broccoli and cauliflower in molybdenum-deficient soils. However, care must be taken because at a level of 0.3 ppm sodium molybdate can cause copper deficiencies in animals, particularly cattle. It is used in industry for corrosion inhibition, as it is a non-oxidizing anodic inhibitor. The addition of sodium molybdate significantly reduces the nitrite requirement of fluids inhibited with nitrite-amine, and improves the corrosion protection of carboxylate salt fluids.Vukasovich, Mark S. Lubrication Engineering 1980. 36(12). 708-12. In industrial water treatment applications where galvanic corrosion is a potential due to bimetallic construction, the application of sodium molybdate is preferred over sodium nitrite. Sodium molybdate has the advantage in that the dosing of lower ppm's of molybdate allow for lower conductivity of the circulating water. Sodium molybdate at levels of 50-100 ppm offer the same levels of corrosion inhibition that sodium nitrite at levels of 800+ ppm. By utilizing lower concentrations of sodium molybdate, conductivity is kept at a minimum and thus galvanic corrosion potentials are decreased.M.

In 1973, Fort Smith Chief Francois Paulette, along with sixteen NWT Chiefs, attempted to file a caveat at the land titles office in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories to gain a legal interest in of land in Northwest Territories, Canada. The Chiefs claimed the land, by virtue of their Aboriginal rights, and sought to prevent the construction of the proposed Mackenzie Valley Gas Pipeline. The land office referred the caveat to the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories. Justice William Morrow, the only sitting judge of that court at the time, held a six-week hearing process to establish whether signatories of Treaty No. 8 and Treaty No. 11 had fully understood the meaning of the treaties they had signed in 1900 and 1921 respectively. Hearings were held in a number of communities in the Northwest Territories (some only accessible by plane), with some hearings being held in informal settings for the convenience of witnesses, many of whom were elderly. Many witnesses testified that the Denesoline signatories did not believe that Treaty No. 8 and No. 11 extinguished their Aboriginal rights to the land and that the Treaties were unfulfilled. Justice Morrow agreed with these witnesses and ruled that the Chiefs had established a case for claiming Aboriginal rights sufficiently to warrant the filing of a caveat. Although the ability to register the caveat was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada, Justice Morrow's findings in respect to Aboriginal rights were not overturned. The Paulette case resulted in the initiation of the Dene/Metis comprehensive land claim process.

It was shot in various locations around Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was directed by Alex Zamm and starred Dabney Coleman, Will Friedle, and Elisabeth Harnois.  Plot  Duncan Fletcher (Will Friedle) is an average teenager in search of a date to his school's spring dance due to a bet he made with his friends, Larry and Arthur. At the mall, he meets a girl named Hallie (Elisabeth Harnois), who happens to be the daughter of the President of the United States, George Richmond (Dabney Coleman), hiding from the Secret Service after she snuck off during one of the presidential campaigns. Duncan, not realizing this, asks her to his school's dance. She accepts and gives him her address. At the White House, as Hallie tells her father about her date, the president refuses to let her go out due to a fundraiser tonight, but after a brief discussion with his wife and first lady, Carol Richmond (Mimi Kuzyk), he reluctantly complies. That night, Duncan's family prepare to throw a house party for his father's company. As Duncan tells his family about his date, he asks his father, Charles Fletcher (Jay Thomas), if he could borrow the company car, a red BMW 525i. His father declines, but Duncan takes the company car anyway and goes to Hallie's to pick her up, only to end up at the White House. When he enters, Hallie has Duncan meet her father, and Duncan is informed that there are limitations on where they can and cannot go, and that the Secret Service will be with them the entire time. Though Hallie says that she and Duncan are only going to dinner and a movie, she and Duncan sneak away from the Secret Service at the movie theater after pretending to share a kiss on the floor. Once the Secret Service agents realize that they are missing, they call Director Dan Thornhill (Frank Moore), whom then informs the president. Once the president learns of this, he orders for Duncan's family to be brought to the fundraiser. Hallie suggests that they go shopping to buy new clothes for their date at a store called F/X, where Hallie tries on many outfits in the dressing room while Duncan buys a holographic ring from a conventional gumball machine during his wait. Once Hallie finishes, she emerges from the dressing room in a pink mini-dress and shows it to Duncan, before removing her hairpin. She then picks an outfit for Duncan - an expensive leather coat. However, before they can go to the dance, Hallie wants to go to a new night club that opened recently called Club Alien. During the house party at the Fletcher's residence, Mr. Fletcher realized that Duncan disobeyed him after he noticed the company car missing in the garage and tries to hide this from his boss, Herb. The family is then visited by the Secret Service, who inform them that Duncan has ran away with the president's daughter and orders them to see the president at the fundraiser. The Secret Service men also informed them that Duncan and Hallie were last seen driving in a red BMW that Herb overhears and is crossed with Charles for letting his son drive the company car. While Hallie drives to Club Alien in Duncan's vehicle, they stop at a red light and encounter trouble with a truck of red necks who flirt at Hallie, much to her annoyance. Hallie warns the red necks to back off, as she believes that Duncan would defend her from them, prompting one of the red necks to threaten Duncan. However, Duncan urges Hallie to run the red light, accidentally treading over the redneck's foot. As they encounter many obstacles throughout the night, both their fathers search for them through the city, resulting in their arrest for a traffic violation when a traffic cop fails to recognize the President, although they are released later by their families. Duncan and Hallie both manage to return home safely, but are unhappy as they realize after their first kiss how much they like each other. Though they never make it to the dance, Duncan feels satisfied with the outcome of the date. Though Duncan's father grounds him, after he cooled off for a bit, he is no longer grounded and he begins to spend more time with his son until he learns that Duncan used his father's credit card. Duncan loses the bet and pays his friends, since he did not bring Hallie with him. When President Richmond arrives at Duncan's school to thank him for Hallie's date, he allows Duncan to continue seeing Hallie and strikes up a friendship with Duncan's family. As a result, Duncan's reputation at school improves from his status as the boyfriend of the President's daughter and Duncan's father is promoted at work after his boss is allowed to meet the President and play golf with him. Hallie and Duncan are able to pursue a real relationship and happily go on a second date with the President's approval and the Secret Service SUVs and Marine One accompanying them.

Ben Vorlich (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Mh√πrlaig) is a Scottish mountain situated between the northernmost section of Loch Lomond and Loch Sloy. It is one of the Arrochar Alps, though it lies separate from the other peaks in the range, as indicated by the large topographic prominence. It is the highest point of the historic county of Dunbartonshire. The A82 road and the West Highland railway line run on the eastern side of Ben Vorlich, above the shoreline of Loch Lomond. The peak forms a north-south ridge on the western side of Loch Lomond, with a subsidiary ridge known as Little Hills running from the summit east down to the shores of the loch. There are three small summits around 800 m apart along the main ridge; the central one is the highest, though the southern one has a trig point. Unlike many Scottish peaks, there is no single route up Ben Vorlich that is used to the virtual exclusion of all others. Most walkers elect to follow one of the ridges: several points on the southern ridge may be reached by way of the track leading to Loch Sloy, the Little Hills can be climbed from Ardvorlich on the lochside and an ascent of the northern ridge is usually commenced from a point between Ardlui and Inverarnan.

In the event of war with the Soviets, American soldiers could be flown with their \\"to-accompany-troops\\" (TAT) gear on Civil Reserve Air Fleet commercial airliners to use this pre-positioned equipment. The equipment was set up in unit configurations to aid in force building and movement to support the US Army's general defensive plan (GDP). In the early 1980s, most of the equipment for POMCUS came from US Army units in the USA that had to be upgraded to meet specifications for pre-positioning in Europe. By the late 1980s, the plan had evolved to pre-position Six Divisions of equipment in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.Three Divisions were pre- positioned, with other sites being considered for the other three divisions, when the Berlin wall fell, and the Soviet Union no longer existed. Plans were then cut back severely and sites that were considered in Belgium and the Netherlands were cancelled. POMCUS was considered to be so important that a \\"Warm-Base\\" Hospital was completed in the Netherlands, in 1988. The hospital was completely equipped, so that in the event of war, Doctors could be flown in and immediately take care of injured military personnel. The hospital had the latest equipment available at that time, and was kept in operating condition by local Dutch personnel. Originally, POMCUS sites were primarily simply guarded, fenced-in lots of pre-loaded, maintained vehicles and weapons systems ready to roll, although the precursor to POMCUS sites was a series of underground storage areas liberated from the Germans in Pirmasens and the outlying areas Husterhoeh Kaserne utilised to store combat-readied armour. During the late 1960s-1980s, the above-ground POMCUS facilities were updated into large aluminium-over-steel warehouses, which provided the benefits of less weathering and lower maintenance requirements for the systems stored in them, as well as providing first-line defence against EMP radiation which could affect the electronics in both the communications systems and the recently implemented solid-state ignition systems on some vehicles. POMCUS sites were one of the first Army installations that used Bar Codes on equipment, so that whenever a piece of equipment left a warehouse the bar code registered that the equipment had left its storage area.

It was built on sand between 1961 and 1964. The lighthouse took over duties and replaced the historical Roter Sand Lighthouse on 1 September 1964. The latter had been built from 1883 to 1885.  General aspects  The Alte Weser Lighthouse was built between 1961 and 1964. It consists of steel-coated ferroconcrete and a steel superstructure. It was built offshore into a sand bed at a depth of 11 m below mean sea level. Its height measures about 40 m above msl. Depending on the color of the light beam, its visibility is between 18 and 23 sm. The only inhabited place where the Alte Weser or Roter Sand Lighthouse can be seen with the naked eye is the German island of Wangerooge.  Technical data  The light characteristic is \\"F WRG\\", i.e. a continuous light, coloured white, red or green depending on the bearing of the lighthouse. The light is emitted by a 2000 Watts Xenon lamp. On low visibility conditions a foghorn sounds a signal, the Morse code letters \\"AL\\" with an interval of one minute. On the tower a number of additional navigational and meteorological devices are installed next to the optics. Directional antennae and a radar serve as means of security in the Weser approach while an anemometer and an automated tide gauge collect data on wind conditions and water levels. The tower has a built-in emergency power system and provides accommodation for a maintenance crew.  Construction  The Roter Sand (German transl. \\"red sand\\") is located in the outer Weser waterway in the German Bight, southern North Sea. At the end of the 1950s the lighthouse had been badly damaged by corrosion, corrosion, and leaching of its concrete. To replace the old lighthouse, the Alte Weser was built in the years 1961‚Äì1964 not far from the former location. Simultaneously, the conditions for the ships' traffic in the \\"Outer-Weser\\" waterway were intended to be improved and the new lighthouse was planned to be established as an offshore part of the radar chain on the Weser between Bremen and the North Sea (fig. 1). The novel form of the tower (fig. 2), i.e. its downward tapering tower shaft together with its cantilevered upper storeys was based on a design by engineer Andreas Carstens, Bremerhaven. The conical design of the tower was intended to minimize exposure to waves and drift ice. The German Waterway Administration, the Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt (WSA) Bremerhaven as the responsible governmental agency, assigned the task of workmanship to a cooperative of companies: Philipp Holzmann, Strabag Bau AG, Hermann Moeller. This cooperative instructed the Howaldtswerke in Kiel to carry out the steelworks. The steelwork's for the tower shaft, the upper storeys and the equipment were carried out in a dry dock of the Howaldts factory in Kiel (fig. 3). The tower shaft was towed through the Kiel Canal towards its destination site in the Outer-Weser waterway (fig. 6). For this purpose a floating offshore lift platform which had been supplied with a central cut-out for the tower was used. At the site the shaft was lowered and subsequently jetted into the sand to the intended depth. After feeding in a layer of underwater concrete, the shaft was evacuated and the additional layers of ferroconcrete were installed (fig. 5). Frequently, adequate supply of building materials was hampered and delayed, because relatively small coasters had been contracted for transport, which were quite sensitive to the state of the sea and weather conditions. Timing was especially important in order to ensure joints were constructed correctly. To this end, all building materials needed for the underwater concrete had to arrive on time and without delay. Therefore, an optimal weather period was required. A further interruption happened due to two accidents. The first was fatal when a sudden leak killed two workers. However, the exact reason for the accident was never fully revealed. The tower shaft which had been lowered and jetted into the sand had to be abandoned. The upper storeys were detached and transported back to Kiel on the offshore lift platform for later use. One year later the upper storeys were re-used on a second tower shaft nearby. The old stump of the tower shaft remains underground today. The storm surge of 1962 which cost many human lives in Hamburg and other places on the German coast had no impact on the construction of the lighthouse. The first accident did however force a new start to the works in Kiel, causing a delay of one year. The second accident happened because of a malfunction of the gripper at the front legs of the offshore lift platform. A second platform had to be used in order to repair and replace the first one. In the third year, after the lift platform had been repaired, the construction works resumed at the tower shaft and were subsequently completed. Next, the offshore lift platform could pick up the upper storeys which were still stored at Kiel (fig. 6) to join them with the tower shaft in the North Sea. Under favourable weather conditions the upper storeys were placed on top of the tower without complications (fig. 7). Now, the completing works such as installation of the optics including the corresponding blinds and the installation of the standby sets were implemented. The power supply of the lighthouse demanded special attention. A 6 kV cable was run from the Robbenplate Lighthouse (fig. 1) towards Alte Weser, jetted in using a special device (Einspuelstiefel, Fig. 8) and threaded into the tower through a protective cable conduit. In addition, measures had to be taken to adopt the same cable for the planned Tegeler Plate Lighthouse (see below). The foundation of the building was safeguarded with stone ballast poured down on bush mats against rinsing and water erosion. In 1964 the light of Alte Weser Lighthouse went into service (fig. 9). In 1972 the four keepers were displaced when the lighthouse became automated.

This effort simultaneously made it possible to take the light vessel Bremen out of service. As a location for the new lighthouse the Tegeler Plate sand bar was chosen. The tower shaft, as well as the upper storeys of the Tegeler Plate Lighthouse, were intended to be entirely built as steel construction. The tower shaft's height of about 46 m as well as the local shallow water conditions (i.e. average low tide about 2.50 m above ground level) made it possible to pile jet the tower shaft 18 m deep into the sand in one step. To this end, jetting the tower shaft into sand as a first step was considered to be followed by placing the upper storeys on top as a second step. In this manner corrections of slight discrepancies of the shaft could be made. After the steelworks had been carried out at Wilhelmhaven, the tower shaft and the upper stories were brought to the intended position by a salvage ship carrying heavy water pump systems, and were jetted into the sandy ground. The power cable already installed at the Alte Weser Lighthouse was integrated. The Tegeler Plate Lighthouse went into service in 1966 ‚Äì it was unmanned and operated remotely from the beginning. Only emergency quarters were set up for maintenance workers. The base was secured through stone ballasting. With these arrangements two important steps for the deepening project of the Outer Weser waterway had been accomplished.  In popular culture  Alte Weser Lighthouse was featured on a German stamp in 1976. Alte Weser Lighthouse, as well as Tegeler Plate, Roter Sand and others, were shown on various paintings by Katharina Noack.

Akbar Tandjung (born Sibolga, North Sumatra; 14 August 1945) is an Indonesian politician who is a former chairman of Golkar Party. He served as a minister under former presidents Suharto and B.J. Habibie. He was Speaker of the People's Representative Council (DPR) from 1999 to 2004. In 2002 he was convicted of corruption over the embezzlement of funds intended for food relief for the poor, but the conviction was overturned on appeal in 2004. Early life and education Djandji Akbar Zahiruddin Tandjung was born 14 August 1945 in Sibolga during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. The son of Zahiruddin Tandjung and Siti Kasmijah, he is a Muslim Batak by ethnicity. He is the 13th of 16 siblings, four of whom died before adulthood. He attended the Muhammadiyah People's School in Sorkam, Central Tapanuli, North Sumatra province. He also attended Nasrani Elementary School in Medan, North Sumatra. In Jakarta, he attended Cikini Junior High School and then Kanisius High School, graduating in 1964. He studied at the University of Indonesia, where he was active in student movements and served as president of the Faculty of Technology. From 1972 to 1974, he was president of the influential Indonesian Muslim Students Association (HMI). He also joined the Indonesian National Youth Committee (KNPI), which is affiliated to Golkar. Political career In 1976, then-Golkar leader Amir Murtono invited Akbar to stand for election for the party. In 1977, Akbar was elected to the House of Representatives, representing Golkar for East Java province. He was re-elected in 1982 and 1987. In the late 1980s, when long-serving president Suharto started to more actively seek Muslim support, Akbar became deputy secretary general of Golkar. Under Suharto, he served as State Minister for Youth Affairs and Sport from 1988 to 1993. He then served as State Minister of Housing from March 1993 to May 1998. Under Suharto's successor B.J. Habibie, he served as State Secretary from May 1998 to May 1999. He was chairman of Golkar from 1998 to 2004, helping to rebuild the party following Suharto's 1998 resignation. At the Golkar convention in December 2004, Akbar lost the party's chairmanship to Jusuf Kalla, at that time the country's vice president. Akbar has remained an influential figure within Golkar. Ahead of the 2014 Indonesian presidential elections, he criticized Golkar's plan to nominate then-party chairman Aburizal Bakrie for the presidency.Margareth Aritonang, 'Golkar less than united ahead of elections', The Jakarta Post, 23 November 2013. The party ended up dropping Bakrie as its candidate and threw its weight behind Prabowo Subianto, with Akbar serving as one of his campaign advisers. In 2017, Akbar expressed concern that Golkar could lose legislative seats in Indonesia's 2019 elections because of a negative public perception of its chairman, Setya Novanto. He said the party should make changes to improve its image. Corruption conviction, appeal and acquittal In September 2002, Central Jakarta District Court sentenced Akbar to three years in jail for embezzling Rp 40 billion (about $4.8 million) in state funds that were supposed to have been spent on a 1999 food program for the poor. Prosecutors had recommended a four-year jail sentence, although the maximum penalty for corruption and abuse of power is 20 years. Two other people involved in the scandal, Dadang Sukandar and Winfried Simatupang, were each sentenced to 18 months in jail. The two served their time in Jakarta's Cipinang penitentiary, but Akbar never went to jail. He remained free pending a lengthy appeal process and continued to hold his government and political jobs. In January 2003, Jakarta High Court upheld his conviction. In February 2004, a panel of five Supreme Court judges overturned Akbar's corruption conviction on the grounds he had just been following orders in 1999 from then-president B.J. Habibie. After the ruling, a dissenting judge, Abdul Rahman Saleh, said Akbar had engaged in \\"corrupt practice\\" and was guilty of \\"shameful conduct because he failed to show minimal appropriate efforts to protect state money‚Äù.

In early development, it serves as a suspension for the endosperm of the coconut during the nuclear phase of development. As growth continues, the endosperm matures into its cellular phase and deposits into the rind of the coconut pulp. The liquid inside young coconuts is often preferred to the liquid of a ripened coconut. Coconut water from young green coconuts is also known specifically as buko juice in Philippine English.  Harvesting  Fresh coconuts are typically harvested from the tree while they are green. A hole may be bored into the coconut to provide access to the \\"meat\\" (liquid and pulp). In young coconuts, the liquid and air may be under some pressure and may spray slightly when the inner husk is first penetrated. Coconuts that have fallen to the ground are susceptible to rot and damage from insects or other animals. Products Plain coconut water has long been a popular drink in tropical countries, where it is available fresh, canned, or bottled. Coconuts for drinking are served chilled, fresh, or packaged. They are often sold by street vendors who cut them open with machetes or similar implements in front of customers. Coconut water for retail can be found in ordinary aluminum cans, Tetra Paks, glass bottles or plastic bottles, sometimes with coconut pulp or coconut jelly included. Coconut water can be fermented to produce coconut vinegar. It is also used to make nata de coco, a jelly-like food. Nutritional value Providing of food energy in a amount, coconut water is 95% water and 4% carbohydrates, with protein and total fat content under 1% each (table). Coconut water contains small amounts of vitamins and dietary minerals, all under 10% of the Daily Value (DV). =Risks= One health risk arising from excessive consumption of coconut water is an overabundance of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia), inducing acute kidney failure, heart arrhythmia, loss of consciousness and eventually death. Hyperkalemia and loss of consciousness after the consumption of several liters of coconut water were reported only as a clinical case study in association with one individual's use of a commercial product following physical exertion. The Food and Drug Administration has identified a risk of bacterial contamination in coconut water sold as \\"raw\\". Anecdotal sources describe coconut water being used in southern part of India for senicide, the killing of elderly people, a procedure known as thalaikoothal. In this custom, the elderly person is made to drink an excessive amount of coconut water, eventually resulting in fever and death, the exact causes of which were not determined. Commercialization Since the early 21st century, coconut water has been marketed in Western countries as a natural energy or sports drink having low levels of fat, carbohydrates, and calories, and significant electrolyte content. = False advertising = Marketing claims attributing health benefits to coconut water are not based on science and are disallowed by certain regulatory agencies like the United States Food and Drug Administration which warned producers about misleading marketing claims that coconut water is antiviral, can lower cholesterol, can regulate blood glucose levels, and other false claims, as inappropriate for the product. Some companies have faced class action lawsuits over false advertising claims that the product was \\"super-hydrating\\", \\"nutrient-packed\\", and \\"mega-electrolyte\\". The plaintiffs also alleged that one company, Vita Coco, falsely claimed that its product had \\"15 times the electrolytes found in sports drinks\\" and misrepresented the levels of sodium and magnesium as advertised. The company denied any wrongdoing and settled the lawsuit for US$10 million in April 2012.  Medical use in Cambodia  Although substituting coconut water for saline is not recommended by physicians today, it was a common practice during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. The Documentation Center of Cambodia cited the practice of allowing untrained nurses to administer green coconut water during the Pol Pot regime as a crime against humanity.

It is generally employed with children aged 3 years through 11 and provides a way for them to express their experiences and feelings through a natural, self- guided, self-healing process. As child experiences and knowledge are often communicated through play, it becomes an important vehicle for them to know and accept themselves.  Play as therapy  According to Jean Piaget, \\"play provides the child with the live, dynamic, individual language indispensable for the expression of [the child‚Äôs] subjective feelings for which collective language alone is inadequate.\\" Play helps a child develop mastery over his innate abilities resulting to a sense of worth and aptitude. During play, children are driven to meet the essential need of exploring and mastering their environment. Play also contributes in the advancement of creative thinking. Play likewise provides a way for children to release strong sentiments making them feel relieved. During play, children play out undesirable life experiences by breaking them down into smaller parts, discharging emotional states or frames of mind that go with each part, integrating every experience back into the understanding they have of themselves and gaining a higher level and a greater degree of mastery. General Play therapy is a form of counseling or psychotherapy that uses play to communicate with and help people, especially children, to prevent or resolve psychosocial challenges. This is thought to help them towards better social integration, growth and development, decreased aggression, emotional modulation, social skill development, empathy, and trauma resolution. Play therapy also develops self-efficacy and coping skills Play therapy can also be used as a tool for diagnosis. A play therapist observes a client playing with toys (play-houses, pets, dolls, etc.) to determine the cause of the disturbed behavior. The objects and patterns of play, as well as the willingness to interact with the therapist, can be used to understand the underlying rationale for behavior both inside and outside of therapy session. Caution, however, should be taken when using play therapy for assessment and/or diagnostic purposes. According to the psychodynamic view, people (especially children) will engage in play behavior in order to work through their interior obfuscations and anxieties. According to this particular viewpoint, play therapy can be used as a self-help mechanism, as long as children are allowed time for \\"free play\\" or \\"unstructured play.\\" However, some forms of therapy depart from non-directiveness in fantasy play, and introduce varying amounts of direction, during the therapy session. An example of a more directive approach to play therapy, for example, can entail the use of a type of desensitization or relearning therapy, to change troubling behaviors, either systematically or through a less structured approach. The hope is that through the language of symbolic play, such desensitization will likely take place, as a natural part of the therapeutic experience, and lead to positive treatment outcomes. History Play has been recognized as important since the time of Plato (429‚Äì347 B.C.) who reportedly observed, \\"you can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation\\" [This quote may be erroneously attributed to Plato, see https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/07/30/hour-play/]. In the eighteenth century, Rousseau (1712‚Äì1778), in his book Emile, wrote about the importance of observing play as a vehicle to learn about and understand children. Friedrich Fr√∂bel, in his book The Education of Man (1903), emphasized the importance of symbolism in play. He observed, \\"play is the highest development in childhood, for it alone is the free expression of what is in the child's soul...children's play is not mere sport. It is full of meaning and import.\\" The first documented case, describing the therapeutic use of play, was in 1909 when Sigmund Freud published his work with \\"Little Hans\\". Little Hans was a five-year-old child who was suffering from a simple phobia. Freud saw him once briefly and recommended that his father take note of Hans' play to provide insights that might assist the child. The case of \\"Little Hans\\" was the first case in which a child's difficulty was related to emotional factors. Hermine Hug-Hellmuth formalized the play therapy process by providing children with play materials to express themselves and emphasize the use of the play to analyze the child. In 1919, Melanie Klein (1955) began to implement the technique of using play as a means of analyzing children under the age of six. She believed that child's play was essentially the same as free association used with adults, and that as such, it was provide access to the child's unconscious. Anna Freud (1946, 1965) utilized play as a means to facilitate positive attachment to the therapist and gain access to the child's inner life. In the 1930s David Levy developed a technique he called release therapy. His technique emphasized a structured approach. A child, who had experienced a specific stressful situation, would be allowed to engage in free play. Subsequently, the therapist would introduce play materials related to the stress-evoking situation allowing the child to reenact the traumatic event and release the associated emotions. In 1955, Gove Hambidge expanded on Levy's work emphasizing a \\"structured play therapy\\" model, which was more direct in introducing situations. The format of the approach was to establish rapport, recreate the stress-evoking situation, play out the situation and then free play to recover. Jesse Taft (1933) and Frederick Allen (1934) developed an approach they entitled relationship therapy. The primary emphasis is placed on the emotional relationship between the therapist and the child. The focus is placed on the child's freedom and strength to choose. Carl Rogers (1942) expanded the work of the relationship therapist and developed non-directive therapy, later called client-centered therapy. Virginia Axline (1950) expanded on her mentor's concepts. In her article entitled 'Entering the child's world via play experiences', Axline summarized her concept of play therapy, stating, \\"A play experience is therapeutic because it provides a secure relationship between the child and the adult, so that the child has the freedom and room to state himself in his own terms, exactly as he is at that moment in his own way and in his own time\\" (Progressive Education, 27, p. 68). Axline also wrote Dibs in Search of Self, which describes a series of play therapy sessions over a period of a year. In 1953 Clark Moustakas wrote his first book, Children in Play Therapy. In 1956 he compiled Publication of The Self, the result of the dialogues between Moustakas, Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and others, forging the humanistic psychology movement. Filial therapy, developed by Bernard and Louise Guerney, was a new innovation in play therapy during the 1960s. The filial approach emphasizes a structured training program for parents in which they learn how to employ child-centered play sessions in the home. In the 1960s, with the advent of school counselors, school-based play therapy began a major shift from the private sector. Counselor-educators such as Alexander (1964); Landreth; Muro (1968); Myrick and Holdin (1971); Nelson (1966); and Waterland (1970) began to contribute significantly, especially in terms of using play therapy as both an educational and preventive tool in dealing with children‚Äôs issues. 1973 Moustakas continued his journey into play therapy and published his novel The child's discovery of himself. Moustakas' work as being concerned with the kind of relationship needed to make therapy a growth experience. His stages start with the child's feelings being generally negative and as they are expressed, they become less intense, the end results tend to be the emergence of more positive feelings and more balanced relationships. Models An individual engaging in sandplay therapy. Equipment used for sandplay therapy. An example of spontaneous adult psychotherapic sand play. Play therapy can be divided into two basic types: non-directive and directive. Non-directive play therapy is a non-intrusive method in which children are encouraged to work toward their own solutions to problems through play. It is typically classified as a psychodynamic therapy. In contrast, directive play therapy is a method that includes more structure and guidance by the therapist as children work through emotional and behavioral difficulties through play. It often contains a behavioral component and the process includes more prompting by the therapist. Directive play therapy is more likely to be classified as a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. Both types of play therapy have received at least some empirical support. On average, play therapy treatment groups, when compared to control groups, improve by .8 standard deviations. =Nondirective play therapy= Non-directive play therapy, also called client-centred and unstructured play therapy, is guided by the notion that if given the chance to speak and play freely under optimal therapeutic conditions, troubled children and young people will be able to resolve their own problems and work toward their own solutions. In other words, non-directive play therapy is regarded as non- intrusive. The hallmark of non-directive play therapy is that it has few boundary conditions and thus can be used at any age. This therapy originates from Carl Rogers' non-directive psychotherapy and in his characterisation of the optimal therapeutic conditions. Virginia Axline adapted Carl Rogers's theories to child therapy in 1946 and is widely considered the founder of this therapy.Kendrick, P., Wilson, K., & Ryan, V. (1992) Play Therapy: A Nondirective Approach for Children and Adolescents. North Yorkshire, UK: Elsevier Science Limited. Different techniques have since been established that fall under the realm of non-directive play therapy, including traditional sandplay therapy, family therapy, and play therapy with the use of toys. Each of these forms is covered briefly below. Play therapy using a tray of sand and miniature figures is attributed to Margaret Lowenfeld, who established her \\"World Technique\\" in 1929. Dora Kalff combined Lowenfeld's World Technique with Jung's idea of the collective unconscious and received Lowenfeld's permission to name her version of the work \\"sandplay\\" (Kalff, 1980). As in traditional non-directive play therapy, research has shown that allowing an individual to freely play with the sand and accompanying objects in the contained space of the sandtray (22.5\\" x 28.5\\") can facilitate a healing process as the unconscious expresses itself in the sand and influences the sand player. When a client creates in the sandtray, little instruction is provided and the therapist offers little or no talk during the process. This protocol emphasises the importance of holding what Kalff (1980) referred to as the \\"free and protected space\\" to allow the unconscious to express itself in symbolic, non-verbal play. Upon completion of a tray, the client may or may not choose to talk about his or her creation, and the therapist, without the use of directives and without touching the sandtray, may offer supportive response that does not include interpretation. The rationale is that the therapist trusts and respects the process by allowing the images in the tray to exert their influence without interference. Sand tray therapy can be used during family therapy. The limitations presented by the boundaries of the sandtray can serve as physical and symbolic limitations to families in which boundary distinctions are an issue. Also when a family works together on a sandtray, the therapist may make several observations, such as unhealthy alliances, who works with whom, which objects are selected to be incorporated into the sandtray, and who chooses which objects. A therapist may assess these choices and intervene in an effort to guide the formation of healthier relationships. Using toys in non-directive play therapy with children is another common method therapists employ. This method was derived from the creative toys used in Freud's theoretical orientations. The idea behind this method is that children will be better able to express their feelings toward themselves and their environment through play with toys than through verbalisation of their feelings. Through these actions, then, children may be able to experience catharsis, gain more or better insight into their consciousness, thoughts, and emotions, and test their own reality. Popular toys used during therapy are animals, dolls, hand puppets, crayons, and cars. Therapists have deemed toys such as these more likely to encourage dramatic play or creative associations, both of which are important in expression. Efficacy Play therapy has been considered to be an established and popular mode of therapy for children for over sixty years. Critics of play therapy have questioned the effectiveness of the technique for use with children and have suggested using other interventions with greater empirical support such as cognitive behavioral therapy. They also argue that therapists focus more on the institution of play rather than the empirical literature when conducting therapy Classically, Lebo argued against the efficacy of play therapy in 1953, and Phillips reiterated his argument again in 1985. Both claimed that play therapy lacks in several areas of hard research. Many studies included small sample sizes, which limits the generalisability, and many studies also only compared the effects of play therapy to a control group. Without a comparison to other therapies, it is difficult to determine if play therapy really is the most effective treatment. Recent play therapy researchers have worked to conduct more experimental studies with larger sample sizes, specific definitions and measures of treatment, and more direct comparisons. Research is lacking on the overall effectiveness of using toys in non-directive play therapy. Dell Lebo found that out of a sample of over 4,000 children, those who played with recommended toys vs. non-recommended or no toys during non-directive play therapy were not more likely to verbally express themselves to the therapist. Examples of recommended toys would be dolls or crayons, while example of non-recommended toys would be marbles or a checker game. There is also ongoing controversy in choosing toys for use in non-directive play therapy, with choices being largely made through intuition rather than through research. However, other research shows that following specific criteria when choosing toys in non-directive play therapy can make treatment more efficacious. Criteria for a desirable treatment toy include a toy that facilitates contact with the child, encourages catharsis, and lead to play that can be easily interpreted by a therapist. Several meta analyses have shown promising results toward the efficacy of non-directive play therapy. Meta analysis by authors LeBlanc and Ritchie, 2001, found an effect size of 0.66 for non-directive play therapy. This finding is comparable to the effect size of 0.71 found for psychotherapy used with children, indicating that both non-directive play and non-play therapies are almost equally effective in treating children with emotional difficulties. Meta analysis by authors Ray, Bratton, Rhine and Jones, 2001, found an even larger effect size for nondirective play therapy, with children performing at 0.93 standard deviations better than non-treatment groups. These results are stronger than previous meta-analytic results, which reported effect sizes of 0.71, 0.71, and 0.66. Meta analysis by authors Bratton, Ray, Rhine, and Jones, 2005, also found a large effect size of 0.92 for children being treated with non- directive play therapy. Results from all meta-analyses indicate that non- directive play therapy has been shown to be just as effective as psychotherapy used with children and even generates higher effect sizes in some studies. There are several predictors that may also influence the effectiveness of play therapy with children. Number of sessions is a significant predictor in post- test outcomes, with more sessions being indicative of higher effect sizes. Although positive effects can be seen with the average 16 sessions, there is a peak effect when a child can complete 35-40 sessions. An exception to this finding is children undergoing play therapy in critical-incident settings, such as hospitals and domestic violence shelters. Results from studies that looked at these children indicated a large positive effect size after only 7 sessions, which provides the implication that children in crisis may respond more readily to treatment Parental involvement is also a significant predictor of positive play therapy results. This involvement generally entails participation in each session with the therapist and the child. Parental involvement in play therapy sessions has also been shown to diminish stress in the parent-child relationship when kids are exhibiting both internal and external behaviour problems. Despite these predictors which have been shown to increase effect sizes, play therapy has been shown to be equally effective across age, gender, and individual vs. group settings. =Directive play therapy= Directive play therapy is guided by the notion that using directives to guide the child through play will cause a faster change than is generated by nondirective play therapy. The therapist plays a much bigger role in directive play therapy. Therapists may use several techniques to engage the child, such as engaging in play with the child themselves or suggesting new topics instead of letting the child direct the conversation himself. Stories read by directive therapists are more likely to have an underlying purpose, and therapists are more likely to create interpretations of stories that children tell. In directive therapy games are generally chosen for the child, and children are given themes and character profiles when engaging in doll or puppet activities. This therapy still leaves room for free expression by the child, but it is more structured than nondirective play therapy. There are also different established techniques that are used in directive play therapy, including directed sandtray therapy and cognitive behavioral play therapy. Directed sandtray therapy is more commonly used with trauma victims and involves the \\"talk\\" therapy to a much greater extent. Because trauma is often debilitating, directed sandplay therapy works to create change in the present, without the lengthy healing process often required in traditional sandplay therapy. This is why the role of the therapist is important in this approach. Therapists may ask clients questions about their sandtray, suggest them to change the sandtray, ask them to elaborate on why they chose particular objects to put in the tray, and on rare occasions, change the sandtray themselves. Use of directives by the therapist is very common. While traditional sandplay therapy is thought to work best in helping clients access troubling memories, directed sandtray therapy is used to help people manage their memories and the impact it has had on their lives. Roger Phillips, in the early 1980s, was one of the first to suggest that combining aspects of cognitive behavioral therapy with play interventions would be a good theory to investigate. Cognitive behavioral play therapy was then developed to be used with very young children between two and six years of age. It incorporates aspects of Beck's cognitive therapy with play therapy because children may not have the developed cognitive abilities necessary for participation in straight cognitive therapy. In this therapy, specific toys such as dolls and stuffed animals may be used to model particular cognitive strategies, such as effective coping mechanisms and problem-solving skills. Little emphasis is placed on the children's verbalizations in these interactions but rather on their actions and their play. Creating stories with the dolls and stuffed animals is a common method used by cognitive behavioral play therapists in order to change children's maladaptive thinking. Efficacy The efficacy of directive play therapy has been less established than that of nondirective play therapy, yet the numbers still indicate that this mode of play therapy is also effective. In 2001 meta analysis by authors Ray, Bratton, Rhine, and Jones, direct play therapy was found to have an effect size of .73 compared to the .93 effect size that nondirective play therapy was found to have. Similarly in 2005 meta analysis by authors Bratton, Ray, Rhine, and Jones, directive therapy had an effect size of 0.71, while nondirective play therapy had an effect size of 0.92. Although the effect sizes of directive therapy are statistically significantly lower than those of nondirective play therapy, they are still comparable to the effect sizes for psychotherapy used with children, demonstrated by Casey, Weisz, and LeBlanc. A potential reason for the difference in the effect size may be due to the amount of studies that have been done on nondirective vs. directive play therapy. Approximately 73 studies in each meta analysis examined nondirective play therapy, while there were only 12 studies that looked at directive play therapy. Once more research is done on directive play therapy, there is potential that effect sizes between nondirective and directive play therapy will be more comparable. = Electronic Games = The prevalence and popularity of video games in recent years has created a wealth of psychological studies centered around them. While the bulk of those studies have covered video game violence and addiction, some mental health practitioners are becoming interested in including such games as therapeutic tools. Since the introduction of electronic media into popular culture, the nature of games has become \\"increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature.\\" The commonalities between electronic and traditional play (such as providing a safe space to work through strong emotions) infer similar benefits. Video games have been broken into two categories: \\"serious\\" games, or games developed specifically for health or learning reasons, and \\"off-the-shelf\\" games, or games without a clinical focus that may be re-purposed for a clinical setting. Use of electronic games by clinicians is a new practice, and unknown risks as well as benefits may arise as the practice becomes more mainstream. Most of the current research relating to electronic games in therapeutic settings are focused on alleviating the symptoms of depression, primarily in teens and adolescents. However, some games have been developed specifically for children with anxiety and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), The same company behind the latter intends to create electronic treatments for children on the autism spectrum, and those living with Major Depressive Disorder, among other disorders. The favored approach for mental health treatment at this time is through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). While this method is effective, it is not without its limits: for example, boredom with the material, patients forgetting or not practicing techniques outside of a session, or the accessibility of care. It is these areas that therapists hope to address through the use of electronic games. Preliminary research has been done with small groups, and the conclusions drawn warrant studying the issue in greater depth. Role-playing games (RPGs) are the most common type of electronic game used as part of therapeutic interventions. These are games where players assume roles, and outcomes depend on the actions taken by the player in a virtual world. Psychologists are able to gain insights into the elements of the capability of the patient to create or experiment with an alternate identity. There are also those who underscore the ease in the treatment process since playing an RPG as a treatment situation is often experienced as an invitation to play, which makes the process safe and without risk of exposure or embarrassment. The most well- known and well-documented RPG-style game used in treatment is SPARX. Taking place in a fantasy world, SPARX users play through seven levels, each lasting about half an hour, and each level teaching a technique to overcome depressive thoughts and behaviors. Reviews of the study have found the game treatment comparable to CBT-only therapy though one review noted that SPARX alone is not more effective than typical treatment. There are also studies that found role- playing games, when combined with the Adlerian Play Therapy (AdPT) techniques, lead to increased psychosocial development. ReachOutCentral is geared toward youth and teens, providing gamified information on the intersection of thoughts, feelings, and behavior. An edition developed specifically to aid clinicians, ReachOutPro, offers more tools to increase patients' engagement. Biofeedback (sometimes known as applied psychophysiological feedback) media is more suited to treating a range of anxiety disorders. Biofeedback tools are able to measure heart rate, skin moisture, blood flow, and brain activity to ascertain stress levels, with a goal of teaching stress management and relaxation techniques. The development of electronic games utilizing this equipment is still in its infancy, and thus few games are on the market. As point of fact, The Journey to Wild Divine's developers have asserted that their products are a tool, not a game, though the three installments contain many game elements. Conversely, Freeze Framer's design is reminiscent of an Atari system. Three simplistic games are included in Freeze Framer's 2.0 model, using psychophysiological feedback as a controller. The effectiveness of both pieces of software saw significant changes in participants' depression. A biofeedback game initially designed to assist with anxiety symptoms, Relax to Win, was similarly found to have broader treatment applications. Extended Attention Span Training (EAST), developed by NASA to gauge the attention of pilots, was remodeled as an ADHD aid. Brain waves of participants were monitored during play of commercial video games available on Playstation, and the difficulty of the games increased as participants' attention waned. The efficacy of this treatment is comparable to traditional ADHD intervention. Several online-only or mobile games (Re-Mission, Personal Investigator, Treasure Hunt, and Play Attention) have been specifically noted for use in alleviating disorders other than those for anxiety and mood. Re- Mission 2 especially targets children, the game having been designed with the knowledge that today's youth are immersed in digital media. Mobile applications for anxiety, depression, relaxation, and other areas of mental health are readily available in the Android Play Store and the Apple App Store. The proliferation of laptops, mobile phones, and tablets means one can access these apps at any time, in any place. Many of them are low-cost or even free, and the games do not need to be complex to be of benefit. Playing a three-minute game of Tetris has the potential to curb a number of cravings, a longer play time could reduce flashback symptoms from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and an initial study found that a visual-spatial game such as Tetris or Candy Crush, when played closely following a traumatic event, could be used as a \\"'therapeutic vaccine\\" to prevent future flashbacks. While the field of allowing electronic media a place in a therapist's office is new, the equipment isn't necessarily so. Most children are familiar with modern PCs, consoles, and handheld devices even if the practitioner is not. An even more recent addition to interacting with a game environment is virtual reality equipment, which both adolescent and clinician might need to learn to use properly. The umbrella term for the preliminary studies done with VR is Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET). This research is based on traditional exposure therapy and has been found to be more effective for participants than for those placed in a wait list control group, though not as effective as in- person treatments. One study tracked two groups - one group receiving a typical, lengthier treatment while the other was treated via shorter VRET sessions - and found that the effectiveness for VRET patients was significantly less at the six-month mark.  Efficacy  In the future, clinicians may look forward to using electronic media as a way to assess patients, as a motivational tool, and facilitate social in-person and virtual interactions. Current data, though limited, points toward combining traditional therapy methods with electronic media for the most effective treatment. Parent/child play therapy Several approaches to play therapy have been developed for parents to use in the home with their own children. Training in nondirective play for parents has been shown to significantly reduce mental health problems in at-risk preschool children. One of the first parent/child play therapy approaches developed was Filial Therapy (in the 1960s - see History section above), in which parents are trained to facilitate nondirective play therapy sessions with their own children. Filial therapy has been shown to help children work through trauma and also resolve behavior problems. Another approach to play therapy that involves parents is Theraplay, which was developed in the 1970s. At first, trained therapists worked with children, but Theraplay later evolved into an approach in which parents are trained to play with their children in specific ways at home. Theraplay is based on the idea that parents can improve their children‚Äôs behavior and also help them overcome emotional problems by engaging their children in forms of play that replicate the playful, attuned, and empathic interactions of a parent with an infant. Studies have shown that Theraplay is effective in changing children‚Äôs behavior, especially for children suffering from attachment disorders.Booth, P.B. & Jernberg, A.M. (2010). Theraplay: Helping Parents and Children Build Better Relationships Through Attachment-Based Play. San Francisco, CA: Josey-Bass. In the 1980s, Stanley Greenspan developed Floortime, a comprehensive, play-based approach for parents and therapists to use with autistic children.Greenspan, S.I. & Wieder, S. (2006). Engaging Autism: Using the Floortime Approach to Help Children Relate, Communicate, and Think. Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press. There is evidence for the success of this program with children suffering from autistic spectrum disorders.Solomon, R., J. Necheles, C. Ferch, and D. Bruckman (2007). Pilot study of a parent training program for young children with autism: The P.L.A.Y. Project Home Consultation program\\" Autism, Vol 11 ( 3) 205-224. Lawrence J. Cohen has created an approach called Playful Parenting, in which he encourages parents to play with their children to help resolve emotional and behavioral issues. Parents are encouraged to connect playfully with their children through silliness, laughter, and roughhousing.Cohen, J. L. (2001). Playful Parenting. New York, NY: Ballantine Books, . In 2006, Garry Landreth and Sue Bratton developed a highly researched and structured way of teaching parents to engage in therapeutic play with their children. It is based on a supervised entry level training in child centred play therapy. They named it Child Parent Relationship Therapy.Bratton, S., Landreth, G., Kellam, T., & Blackard, S. (2006). Child Parent Relationship Therapy (CPRT) Treatment Manual: A 10-Session filial therapy model. New York, NY: Routledge. The manual includes a CD-ROM of all training materials for ease of reproduction. These 10 sessions focus on parenting issues in a group environment and utilises video and audio recordings to help the parents receive feedback on their 30-minute 'special play times' with their children. More recently, Aletha Solter has developed a comprehensive approach for parents called Attachment Play, which describes evidence-based forms of play therapy, including non-directive play, more directive symbolic play, contingency play, and several laughter-producing activities. Parents are encouraged to use these playful activities to strengthen their connection with their children, resolve discipline issues, and also help the children work through traumatic experiences such as hospitalisation or parental divorce.Solter, A.

It was the brainchild of Charles W. Adams, an entrepreneur who had founded \\"Adams Associates\\" who were best remembered as the authors of computer equipment surveys during this period. Keydata was located in Technology Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Project MAC, the seminal venture sponsored by MIT which saw the development of MULTICS one of the earliest time sharing software systems. UNIX is a derivative of MULTICS. In addition, IBM's Cambridge Scientific Center was located in Technology Square and this R&D; center developed the first IBM virtual memory system computer, CP/CMS. This was initially installed on a modified IBM System/360 Model 40 computer with the informal name of the \\"Cambridge box.\\" Later IBM used modernized technology for the 360/67 and, today, all modern computers use \\"virtual memory.\\" The coincident location of the nexus of time sharing and virtual memory developers in Cambridge resulted in a heady climate of information technology state-of-the-art knowledge sharing which Keydata profited by, although its UNIVAC computer architecture permitted only software-based implementations. At the time, the fashion was the idea that computer power would be made available on a network connection of a \\"dumb\\" terminal to a \\"smart\\" mainframe computer utility, sharing mammoth computer power with thousands, if not millions, of users. Keydata used a UNIVAC 490 computer to provide commercial applications such as inventory management and accounting applications on a network basis to slow Teletype-based terminals in customer locations and replaced in-house computers and other services with its highly customized parameter-driven distribution and manufacturing applications. Other seminal services were initially implemented on this service, such as Instinet, a stock trading service now owned by Reuters which trades large block transactions on US securities markets, and a very early network inventory network application for Shell Oil company. At its peak, Keydata had hundreds of customers on-line but was never able to compete with emerging micro-computer applications which took over the market, at first, with copies of Keydata developed applications.

Ep = epidermis; C = cortex; BF = bast fibres; P = phloem; X = xylem; Pi = pith Women in southern Norway weaving with linden bast fibres Ndimbu mask from Tanganyika, made with wood, hair and bast Bast fibre (also called phloem fibre or skin fibre) is plant fibre collected from the phloem (the \\"inner bark\\", sometimes called \\"skin\\") or bast surrounding the stem of certain dicotyledonous plants. It supports the conductive cells of the phloem and provides strength to the stem. Some of the economically important bast fibres are obtained from herbs cultivated in agriculture, as for instance flax, hemp, or ramie, but also bast fibres from wild plants, as stinging nettle, and trees such as lime or linden, wisteria, and mulberry have been used in the past. Bast fibres are classified as soft fibres, and are flexible. Fibres from monocotyledonous plants, called \\"leaf fibre\\", are classified as hard fibres and are stiff. Since the valuable fibres are located in the phloem, they must often be separated from the xylem material (\\"woody core\\"), and sometimes also from the epidermis. The process for this is called retting, and can be performed by micro-organisms either on land (nowadays the most important) or in water, or by chemicals (for instance high pH and chelating agents) or by pectinolytic enzymes. In the phloem, bast fibres occur in bundles that are glued together by pectin and calcium ions. More intense retting separates the fibre bundles into elementary fibres, that can be several centimetres long. Often bast fibres have higher tensile strength than other kinds, and are used in high-quality textiles (sometimes in blends with cotton or synthetic fibres), ropes, yarn, paper, composite materials and burlap. An important property of bast fibres is that they contain a special structure, the fibre node, that represents a weak point, and gives flexibility. Seed hairs, such as cotton, do not have nodes. Etymology The term \\"bast\\" derives from Old English b√¶st (‚Äúinner bark of trees from which ropes were made‚Äù), from Proto- Germanic *bastaz (‚Äúbast, rope‚Äù). It may have the same root as Latin ' (\\"bundle\\") and Middle Irish basc (\\"necklace\\"). Use of bast fibre Plants that have been used for bast fibre include flax (from which linen is made), hemp, jute, kenaf, kudzu, linden, milkweed, nettle, okra, paper mulberry, ramie, and roselle hemp. Girl in a dress of bast fibre, Rio Chimor√©, Bolivia 1908‚Äì1909. Bast fibres are processed for use in carpet, yarn, rope, geotextile (netting or matting), traditional carpets, hessian or burlap, paper, sacks, etc. Bast fibres are also used in the non-woven, moulding, and composite technology industries for the manufacturing of non-woven mats and carpets, composite boards as furniture materials, automobile door panels and headliners, etc. From prehistoric times through at least the early 20th century, bast shoes were woven from bast strips in the forest areas of Eastern Europe. Where no other source of tanbark was available, bast has also been used for tanning leather.

The festival is held in a snow castle, built from snow with window panes and other features made of ice. Each winter the castle is built on Yellowknife Bay, on Great Slave Lake. The castle is designed and the construction is supervised by Snowking, Anthony Foliot. The design evolves every year and the castle has grown to include an auditorium, cafe, courtyard, slide, parapets and turrets. Once it is completed, the snow castle becomes a hub for winter arts activity in Yellowknife. The month-long festival includes concerts, art shows, children's theatre, and more. Carvers augment the castle with snow and ice sculptures.  History  Courtyard of the ice castle, 2014 The first Snowking castle was built in 1996.There's a massive castle made of snow in Canada - complete with ice slide From humble beginnings in Yellowknife's Woodyard neighbourhood, where the castle was little more than tunnels in snowbanks augmented by blocks of snow cut from wind-formed snow drifts, the Snowking's Winter Festival has grown into a month-long event based around a large castle built of snow. In the early years, Snowking and Sir Shiverin' Sam built forts of snow with their children near their homes on the shore of Yellowknife Bay. Over the years, the \\"castle\\" grew, and at some point moved out onto the ice of the bay. Each year the structure became larger and more elaborate. Crew members came and went over the years, but the Snowking remained dedicated to his kingdom. Funding was secured so that the castle could continue to operate and to grow each year. In 2009, the Government of Canada provided $16,900 of funding for the 2009 festival via the Building Communities Through Arts and Heritage Program of the Department of Canadian Heritage. In 2004, Foliot received $5,000 from the Northwest Territories Business Development Fund for the operation of the festival.

He made a bungy jump from the Eiffel Tower in 1987 and founded the first commercial bungy site in 1988. Early life Hackett was born in Pukekohe, and grew up on Auckland's North Shore. He attended Westlake Boys High School between 1972 and 1974, where he played rugby union. He left school at the age of sixteen to serve an apprenticeship as a carpenter-joiner. During this time he took up snowboarding and skiing. He moved to Perth where he sold encyclopaedias for four months, later returning to New Zealand to set up a construction business. Bungy jumping Inspired by the Vanuatu ritual called land diving and the Oxford University Dangerous Sports Club experimental jumps in the 1970s, Hackett and fellow adventurer Chris Sigglekow, sought ways to make bungy jumping safe. Using a mathematical formula developed by New Zealand's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, he created a super-stretchy elastic bungy cord in the mid-1980s. In November 1986, Hackett, along with Sigglekow, performed his first amateur bungy jump from the Upper Harbour Bridge (Greenhithe Bridge) in Auckland, citing it as \\"one of the most riveting experiences of my life.\\" Following this Hackett made jumps from a bridge in Hamilton, the Auckland Harbour Bridge and other bridges in the North Island. These first jumps were made using a parachute harness, however, Hackett created a method where the harness was tied to the ankle and demonstrated its use by jumping off the Auckland Harbour Bridge a second time. Hackett travelled to Paris in 1986 as part of the New Zealand Speed Skiing Team. While there he jumped off the Pont de la Caille and a cable car at the Tignes ski resort. He made what became a famous bungy jump off the Eiffel Tower in Paris on 26 June 1987, receiving a brief jail sentence for the illegal feat and generating international attention to the sport. Back in New Zealand, Hackett launched his own company, AJ Hackett Bungy, and created a site on the Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge in Queenstown, New Zealand in 1988 to become the world's first commercial public bungy. He later expanded his company by founding bungy sites in Australia, France (Souleuvre Viaduct in Normandy), Russia (Sochi), Germany, the United States, Mexico, Indonesia, and Macau. He is credited with launching New Zealand's adventure tourism industry and helping to develop a safe code of operation for bungy jumping in use internationally. Hackett initially partnered with Henry van Asch, but the two split in 1997 with van Asch taking over the New Zealand-based business. In 2006 Hackett published his autobiography, Jump Start, which chronicles his bungy jumping adventures. =Records and accomplishments= Hackett is widely known for his many bungy stunts that have earned him Guinness records and personal milestones, including: * 1988: Jumping off the Auckland Stock Exchange Tower, claiming the title as being the world's first bungy off a building * 1990: Jumping out of a helicopter for the first time * 2000: Jumping off the Royal Gorge Bridge, also known as the highest suspension bridge in the world * 2006: Opening and jumping out of the Macau Tower in Macao measuring above ground and holding the title as the highest commercial bungy * 2007: Doubling the previous record of out of a helicopter with 1,499.6 metres in Malaysia with his new bungy technology allowing bungy stretches of over 1 kilometre On 6 November 2007, Hackett was honoured by New Zealand television show This Is Your Life. His company, AJ Hackett Bungy, was recognised by Westpac Queenstown Chamber of Commerce with a Business Excellence Award in the large business category. In the 2017 Queen's Birthday Honours, Hackett was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to adventure tourism.

It is a registered charity under English law. History =Early years (1986‚Äì89)= Following the high- profile disappearance of estate agent Suzy Lamplugh from Fulham in July 1986, two sisters, Janet Newman and Mary Asprey, co-founded the National Missing Persons Helpline. With no news of Lamplugh's whereabouts media attention moved to the apparent lack of support for missing persons' families, such as Paul and Diane Lamplugh. The sisters established the Trust's initial work on missing people. =Helpline (1990‚Äì92)= From a bedroom at the sisters' home in East Sheen, south west London, a start-up service was formed in early 1990. The service used the Freefone number 0500 700 700 ( and this continued in operation until June 2017 when Ofcom closed down all remaining 0500 numbers). Meanwhile, the Suzy Lamplugh Trust moved towards issues surrounding personal safety and safety in the workplace. Initially Mary and Janet and a small team of volunteers simply comforted callers to the helpline. However, they soon realised families wanted more than just telephone support. In 1992, having re- mortgaged their houses, Mary and Janet applied to register National Missing Persons Helpline (NMPH) as a charity. =Expansion (1993)= By the time it became a registered charity in April 1993, NMPH needed new offices to provide a complete range of services for relatives, enabling the charity to both find and support. This expansion was greatly helped by founders of the Big Issue, who secured premises in Mortlake. Missing People is still based there today. ITN's Sir Trevor McDonald ‚Äì later to become a Vice Patron, instigated invaluable publicity. Where funding allowed, new staff and volunteers joined and the information taken from each caller regarding a disappearance became more detailed and more accurate. A department offering Publicity was born. The success of the charity was cemented in its first year by an office visit from Diana, Princess of Wales in October. =Getting the message home (1994)= In February 1994 the resources of NMPH were stretched to the limit by the horrific discoveries at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. Calls to the helpline from relatives of missing people trebled and extra volunteers had to be brought in to answer the phones. New callers reported relatives missing for the first time, even though some had vanished ten years ago or even more. Distressed families already in touch with the helpline called again, in case their missing relative might figure in the investigation. The police directed anxious families to NMPH for comfort and support. Gloucestershire Police called too, seeking help on identifying the bodies found at Cromwell Street and elsewhere. Their initial interest was in women reported missing from Worcestershire and Gloucestershire in the 1970s and 1980s. Some 390 names were supplied including Alison Chambers and Carol Cooper who were later identified as victims. At the same time, details mentioned by Frederick West were passed to NMPH for checking against our database. One result of this was the identification of Juanita Mott another of the victims discovered at Cromwell Street. A positive side effect of the charities role in the investigation was the reunion of 110 non-victim families in less than two months. On 27 June 1994 the charity took over the Message Home Helpline from the Mothers' Union, allowing adult missing people to pass a message home. In response to NMPH's growing achievements the charity was honoured that The Duchess of Gloucester GCVO accepted the role of Patron. The Duchess continues to attend performances on our behalf and raise morale of staff and volunteers with regular visits. =Recognition (1996‚Äì1998)= In 1996 Asprey and Newman were honoured for their services to charity with OBEs. In 1998 both were honoured with the \\"UK Women of Europe Award\\" and in the same year given the European Women of Achievement Humanitarianism Award and The Rotary Foundation's prestigious Paul Harris Fellowships. =Lost from View (2002)= The charity celebrated its 10th birthday. Jointly with the University of York, NMPH produced Lost from View in February 2002. Funded by the Nuffield Foundation, for the first time research used the charity's unique database of all types of missing people to provide information and trends about the missing phenomenon. =Pioneering work (2003‚Äì2004)= Further accolades followed in 2003 when Mary and Janet were invited by The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to a reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the contribution of Pioneers to the life of the Nation. 2003 also saw the national roll out of the 'Missing from Care' project for local authorities 'looked after children' in September. This work for young people continued in May 2004 when NMPH launched the Runaway Helpline, as a direct response to a recommendation in the 2002 report by The Social Exclusion Task Force. =Financial problems (2005‚Äì2006)= The media reported that after years of inadequate funding and little input from the private sector, NMPH was to close. Under the direction of the co-founders, Sir Norman Wakefield was appointed as advisor and formed a consortium of charitable organisations that offered financial support. After an outpouring of public support the Home Office too announced emergency funding for the charity. In September 2005, Paul Tuohy joined the charity as their first Chief Executive. The charity reformed its Board of Trustees and started a considerable process of strategic planning. =Relaunch (2007‚Äì2008)= In May 2007 ‚Äì 2008 the charity relaunched as \\"Missing People\\". This reflected the considerable strategic developments that had been made and the fact that the charity now provided a range of services rather than a single helpline. Also in May, less than one week after her disappearance, missing three-year-old Madeleine McCann had become headline news around the globe. On International Missing Children's Day (26 May) an appeal by the charity was projected onto Marble Arch to highlight Madeleine's disappearance and the plight of missing children across the UK. In August Missing People launched the first comprehensive online \\"missing map\\" in the UK and Missing People TV' ‚Äì the first online channel featuring appeals of missing people. In October the charity along with other NGOs from the English Coalition for Runaway Children asked the government to ‚Äòstop missing the missing issue‚Äô. This led to the government developing a strategy on the protection of young runaways for the first time ever. In 2007 the charity also teamed up with the police to hold their first joint conference on \\"missing\\". Delegates came from across the globe came to Blackpool to debate and learn about the latest developments. In November 2007 Missing People won two awards for its website ‚Äì which received more than 40 million hits in its first year. In December the BBC launched ‚ÄòReunited‚Äô ‚Äì a season of hard hitting programmes about family members seeking to contact missing relatives and the complex reasons people run away. =Missing people march (2008)= In March 2008 hundreds of families of the missing joined together to march through London to highlight the impact of someone going missing from their family. The march was organised and led by Nicki Durbin, mother of missing Luke Durbin, who went missing after a night out in Ipswich, Suffolk in 2006; Val Nettles, mother of missing Damien Nettles, who was last seen in Cowes on the Isle of Wight in 1996 and Jill Blonsky. Radiohead supported the charity with the donation of an exclusive one-off remix tape. April saw the first of the award-winning series Missing Live on BBC One. Successes included finding more than 100 people over the four-week show. Missing People's financial position was strengthened by a landmark decision by the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) to grant the charity ¬£310,000 in June 2008 and by the appointment of five new trustees, which led to a shortlisting at the Third Sector Awards 2009 for most improved Trustee Board. In October 2009 Missing People and Iceland supermarket teamed up to launch milk carton appeals for the missing, following on from the success of a previous initiative with Iceland which had helped to find more than 17 people across millions of cartons. The first new appeal was for Andrew Gosden, a 14-year-old boy last seen at King‚Äôs Cross Station. In December 2009 Missing People launched the first report into the experiences of, and impacts on, the families of missing people called ‚ÄòLiving in Limbo‚Äô. Also in December Missing People teamed up with 95.8 Capital FM to launch the Runaway Helpline text service, the first free helpline text service for young people, which was funded by Vodafone Foundation. =116xxx telephone number issued (2009)= In 2009, Ofcom introduced the first harmonised European numbers for harmonised services of social value, allocating 116 000 to the Missing People service. This number is free to call from mobiles and landlines. =0500 telephone number withdrawn (2017)= The existing 0500 700 700 telephone number continued to operate in parallel with the new 116 000 number for many years. Finally, in June 2017, Ofcom withdrew all 0500 numbers, and the 0500 line was no more. The 0500 number had been free to call from landlines but had cost up to 40p per minute to call from a mobile telephone. Working with the police Missing People works in partnership with police forces and other agencies across the UK to help find missing children and adults and support their family or carer. Missing people offers publicity opportunities to police forces and at the request of the police Missing People can send a missing person a text message informing them about the charity and the support we can offer. These services are available at no direct cost to police forces, the missing person or their family. Events International Missing Children's Day is one day a year when people remember missing children and their families. The charity mark this day by holding their Big Tweet for Missing Children. For 24 hours the charity harnesses the power of Twitter to publicise missing children appeals. The charity tweets a different missing child appeal every 30 minutes for 24 hours and are supported in this by a range of celebrities and organisations. In 2013 The Big Tweet for Missing Children was sponsored by The Sun newspaper and celebrities including Simon Cowell and Stephen Fry endorsed the campaign making it the most successful Big Tweet in the charity's history. Missing People's Twitter handle is @MissingPeople. Miles for Missing People is an annual running event held by the charity Missing People. The popular event, includes a 10K, a 3K and a kids run as well as entertainment and family activities, is held on or around 25 May to mark International Missing Children's Day. Hundreds of supporters and families of missing people join together to participate in the races and fundraise for the charity raising thousands of pounds for the charity's work. The Missing People Cycle Challenge is another of Missing People's popular challenge events which takes place in June or July each year and involves groups of cyclists cycling from Edinburgh to London over a five-day period. The tough challenge is an incredibly rewarding and moving experience for the participants as they support each other through the intense five-day experience in order to raise funds to help support the families of Missing People. The Missing People Choir was founded by the charity in 2014.

The square planar molecular geometry in chemistry describes the stereochemistry (spatial arrangement of atoms) that is adopted by certain chemical compounds. As the name suggests, molecules of this geometry have their atoms positioned at the corners of a square on the same plane about a central atom. Examples Numerous compounds adopt this geometry, examples being especially numerous for transition metal complexes. The noble gas compound XeF4 adopts this structure as predicted by VSEPR theory. The geometry is prevalent for transition metal complexes with d8 configuration, which includes Rh(I), Ir(I), Pd(II), Pt(II), and Au(III). Notable examples include the anticancer drugs cisplatin [PtCl2(NH3)2] and carboplatin. Many homogeneous catalysts are square planar in their resting state, such as Wilkinson's catalyst and Crabtree's catalyst. Other examples include Vaska's complex and Zeise's salt. Certain ligands (such as porphyrins) stabilize this geometry.  Splitting of the energy of the d-orbitals in square planar transition metal complexes  Representative d-orbital splitting diagrams for square planar complexes featuring œÉ-donor (left) and œÉ+œÄ-donor (right) ligands. A general d-orbital splitting diagram for square planar (D4h) transition metal complexes can be derived from the general octahedral (Oh) splitting diagram, in which the dz2 and the dx2‚àíy2 orbitals are degenerate and higher in energy than the degenerate set of dxy, dxz and dyz orbitals. When the two axial ligands are removed to generate a square planar geometry, the dz2 orbital is driven lower in energy as electron-electron repulsion with ligands on the z-axis is no longer present. However, for purely œÉ-donating ligands the dz2 orbital is still higher in energy than the dxy, dxz and dyz orbitals because of the torus shaped lobe of the dz2 orbital. It bears electron density on the x- and y-axes and therefore interacts with the filled ligand orbitals. The dxy, dxz and dyz orbitals are generally presented as degenerate but they have to split into two different energy levels with respect to the irreducible representations of the point group D4h. Their relative ordering depends on the nature of the particular complex. Furthermore, the splitting of d-orbitals is perturbed by œÄ-donating ligands in contrast to octahedral complexes. In the square planar case strongly œÄ-donating ligands can cause the dxz and dyz orbitals to be higher in energy than the dz2 orbital, whereas in the octahedral case œÄ-donating ligands only affect the magnitude of the d-orbital splitting and the relative ordering of the orbitals is conserved.

The Jay Bird Democratic Association was an all-White political organization formed in 1887 by young men to challenge and regain control of the county government from the biracial coalition of former White and Black Republicans who had dominated the county Democratic party and county government since 1869. Murders and political assassinations were committed against persons in each faction in 1888 and 1889.Caldwell, Clifford R.; DeLord, Ron (2016-03-03).

Lynching In Texas. Retrieved 2020-05-09. Fort Bend County, Texas The Jaybird-Woodpecker War ended when the Jaybirds defeated the Black- supported Woodpeckers in a battle in Richmond, Texas, the county seat of Fort Bend County, in August 1889. With support from Texas Governor Lawrence Ross and the Houston Light Guards (the first uniformed state militia company formed after the Civil War), a complete reorganization of county government resulted in the removal or resignation of all Woodpecker officials and the selection of Jaybirds or persons acceptable to the Jaybirds to fill those offices. Fort Bend Courthouse became the epicenter of the Jaybird-Woodpecker War. After a turbulent era of more than 20 years, the White citizenry once more controlled the government. The effects of the post-Reconstruction feud echoed in local politics for decades. The Jaybird victory basically restored White supremacy in the county. They disfranchised the Black voters in the county by using a \\"Whites-only\\" ballot in preliminary party voting from 1889 until 1953. The Jaybird organization and the disfranchisement spread to other counties in the state and remained active politically until the civil rights movement. This device lasted until 1950, when Willie Melton and Arizona Fleming won a lawsuit against the practice in United States District Court, though it was overturned on appeal. In 1953, they ultimately won their suit when the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Jaybird primary unconstitutional in Terry v. Adams, the last of the white primary cases.  Roots of the conflict  The roots of the Jaybird-Woodpecker violence stretch back to the emergence of antebellum plantation society in Fort Bend Country and the end of the American Civil War. The conflicts over slavery and racist White supremacy was a common denominator impacting how the war began, played out, and influenced Fort Bend political and social life for over 100 years. = Antebellum Plantation Society in Fort Bend County = Fort Bend County was colonized by families of the Old 300, who had purchased land rights from Stephen F Austin and the Mexican government in the 1820s and the pacification of local Native American tribes. Within the decades leading up to the American Civil War, Fort Bend country grew into one of the largest and most prosperous slaveholding communities in Texas. Black slaves were either moved with the white colonists or were illegally shipped to Galveston, Texas since slavery was illegal under Mexican law until the Republic of Texas was established in 1836. Slavery was the cornerstone of these plantations that needed laborers for the cotton, sugarcane, and corn agricultural crops. As the demand for these products, especially cotton, increased, the slave labor force \\"expanded from 1,559 slaves in 1850 to 4,127 slaves in 1860.\\" The slaveowners dominated the Fort Bend economy, controlled its politics, and occupied the top rung on the social ladder. Then, voting to secede and join the Confederacy in February 1861. Not surprisingly, 100% of the White male voters voted in favor of secession. Over 100 men from Fort Bend County joined men from neighboring counties and enlisted in a new regiment of what was become known as Colonel Benjamin Terry's Texas Rangers to defend slavery, plantations, and their values of White supremacy over Blacks. Ironically, his son, Kyle Terry who was five years old at time, emerged as one of the leaders some 30 years later in the Jaybird-Woodpecker War, except, unlike his father, he supported the Woodpeckers against the Jaybirds and the White supremacist supporters. = Post-Civil War Society in Fort Bend County = After the conclusion of the American Civil War, the 13th Amendment was ratified, in 1864, the result being that millions of slaves were suddenly free. In Fort Bend County, this new amendment resulted in the freeing of Blacks, who accounted for over 80% of the population at that time. With the enactment of the 15th Amendment in 1870, Black males were given the right to vote, who essentially became a powerful Republican voting block. As a result of outnumbering White males, the vote of freedmen carried most elections that occurred during Reconstruction, the period after the Civil War when Texas was under military rule while transitioning back to statehood in the Union. Also significant was the breaking up of the old plantations into smaller land units, many of which were either purchased by new immigrant farmers from Europe or were rented by Black sharecroppers. While resisting emancipation and Black enfranchisement, plantation elite surprisingly cooperated with the biracial county government that emerged during Reconstruction. Between 1869 and 1889, 44 Black men held different positions in Fort Bend County that included varied roles as sheriff, county commissioner, justice of the peace, and constable. At one point of Fort Bend Reconstruction, more than 50% of the county offices were held by Black politicians. They were actively supported by a small number of Whites who participated in county government as Republicans or as independent Democrats. This meant they did not run or support the all-White Democratic ticket during elections. Unlike other Texas counties at that time, Fort Bend Country actually enjoyed racial co-operation and peace during this post-Civil War era. Despite losing political power and some economic power with the splintering of plantations, Fort Bend Whites maintained their hold on the county economically and socially. White land owners controlled over 80% of the land, which resulted in a high level of tenant farmers and sharecroppers as captured in the 1880 census. Local Whites also erected social boundaries to keep Whites and Blacks segregated. County schools were segregated. According to an 1882-1883 tax assessor report, 193 White children attended one of the five White-only schools, while 1,679 Black students attended one of the 30 Black- only schools. Vigilante citizen groups were also formed to keep Blacks in the county in order, especially from preventing social interactions between Blacks and Whites. = Deep Divisions = While the Jaybird-Woodpecker war was not inevitable, the emergence of younger White males wanting to renew White supremacy and the national Democratic renewal of the late 1880s created an emotionally charged political atmosphere in Fort Bend County. Within the White community, tensions increased between those who supported the Republican or independent county officials and a politically frustrated White community of former slaveowners. The Whites supporting the current biracial politicians wanted to preserve the status quo. The majority of Whites resented the independent Democrats for their \\"treasonous behavior\\" in supporting Blacks' right to vote and to hold public office. They also wanted to increase their political representation, especially with an increase in taxes for all Black and White property owners. Taxes were high and portions of that money went directly into the pockets of officeholders. With these sentiments peculating in the mid- to late 1880s, many young men in Fort Bend County were fed up with the Whites' inability to change county politics via the ballot box. They brought together and formalized the informal vigilante groups into the Jay Bird Democratic Association in July 1888. Conflict The conflict allegedly derived its name from Bob Chapel, a local African-American man who was said to sing about jaybirds and woodpeckers.Yelderman, Pauline. The Jay Bird Democratic Association of Fort Bend County: A White Man's Union. (Waco: Texian Press, 1979). The Jaybirds were White Democrats opposed to the participation of Blacks in local politics, as an alliance of Blacks and Whites (formerly Republican) had elected county officials for 20 years since Reconstruction. The Woodpeckers were nominally Democrats, too, with representatives elected largely by Black voters. An election was held November 6, 1888, that was supervised by Texas Rangers. All of the Woodpecker candidates were elected or re-elected (many had won election in 1884) to their slate of office. This engendered further hostilities from the Jaybirds. In the spring of 1889, Kyle Terry, then a Woodpecker official appointed as the tax assessor, murdered Ned Gibson, a leader of the Jaybirds. He had been on his way to testify in an unrelated cattle-rustling trial against a friend of Terry's being held in a neighboring town. Terry was arrested, but posted bail and moved to Galveston. On January 21, 1890, he was gunned down by Gibson's brother Volney Gibson and a group of Jaybirds, while walking up the stairs to the Galveston courtroom for the preliminary hearing in his trial for the murder of Ned Gibson. Retaliatory murders occurred on both sides, including the 1889 killing of the local sheriff Tom Garvey (a Woodpecker). The violence culminated in the Battle of Richmond, the county seat, on August 16, 1889, when Sheriff Garvey was killed. Seven people were killed in all these incidents. Following this, Governor Lawrence Sullivan Ross declared martial law and dispatched troops from the Houston Light Guards, along with more Texas Rangers. He arrived with the state militia to negotiate a settlement. After the violence subsided, most of the county government resigned. In finding replacements for resigned officials, the Jaybird politicians were the only ones who had sufficient wealth to post bonds for the open offices, and the Jaybirds refused to post bonds for the opposition.Rice, Lawrence Delbert. \\"The Negro in Texas 1874-1900\\" 1968 https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu- ir/bitstream/handle/2346/15468/31295005457121.pdf?sequence=1 As a result, the county government was reorganized under the control of the Jaybird faction. This was formalized through a meeting held on October 3, 1889, and the former officeholders were told to leave town. Subsequently, the Jaybirds held a meeting on October 22, 1889, creating the Jaybird Democratic Organization of Fort Bend County. It dominated local politics for decades into the 1950s. The faction established a \\"White-only\\" preliminary ballot for county offices. This effectively disenfranchised African Americans because the only competitive contest was that within the Democratic Party. A similar White primary measure was adopted by the state legislature in the early 20th century. The Jaybird Democrats retained control until their provision was overturned by a ruling by the United States Supreme Court in Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461 (1953). By that time, two White primary processes authorized by the state government had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court; the second was in Smith v. Allwright (1944).

The songs collected on this release demonstrate major recurrent themes in Bragg's work: highly critical commentary on Thatcherite Britain, laced with poetic love songs.

The children learn simple arithmetic, Dhivehi and some Arabic, and practice reciting the Qur'an. These private schools no longer exist, as western style schools replaced them in the 1980s-1990s¬∑ The first western-style school in the Maldives is the Majeediyya School, a secondary established in 1927.

This Project constituted a comprehensive programme of educational development comprising Expansion of Primary Education, Teacher Training, Curriculum Development, Educational Radio, Community Education Programme for Adult Education and Textbook Development and Printing. The first School under this Project was opened in Baa Atoll Eydhafushi in March 1978 followed by another in HDh. Kulhudhuffushi in March 1979. Schools construction was continued in all atolls and was later complemented by Primary Schools construction project by Japan. Curriculum Development began in 1976, while Teacher Training began in 1977. Simultaneously other Programmes were introduced and continued through the 1970s and until the mid 1980s from where on the First Ten Year Master Plan for Educational (1986-1995) began implementation. Second Master Plan was implemented 1996-2005. These were the bases of educational development in the Maldives begun by the government of President Nasir continued by President Gayoom.

Emotions can be shared across individuals in many different ways both implicitly or explicitly. For instance, conscious reasoning, analysis and imagination have all been found to contribute to the phenomenon. The behaviour has been found in humans, other primates, and dogs. Emotional contagion is important to personal relationships because it fosters emotional synchrony between individuals. A broader definition of the phenomenon suggested by Schoenewolf is \\"a process in which a person or group influences the emotions or behavior of another person or group through the conscious or unconscious induction of emotion states and behavioral attitudes\\". One view developed by Elaine Hatfield, et al., is that this can be done through automatic mimicry and synchronization of one's expressions, vocalizations, postures and movements with those of another person. When people unconsciously mirror their companions' expressions of emotion, they come to feel reflections of those companions' emotions. Etymology The phrase \\"emotional contagion\\" embodies the idea that humans synchronize their own emotions with the emotions expressed by those around them, whether consciously or unconsciously. In a 1993 paper, Psychologists Elaine Hatfield, John Cacioppo, and Richard Rapson define it as \\"the tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of another person's and, consequently, to converge emotionally\\" (p. 96). Hatfield, et al., theorize emotional contagion as a two-step process: Firstly, we imitate people, e.g., if someone smiles at you, you smile back. Secondly, our own emotional experiences change based on the non-verbal signals of emotion that we give off. For example, smiling makes one feel happier and frowning making one feel worse. Mimicry seems to be one foundation of emotional movement between people. Emotional contagion and empathy have an interesting relationship, in that they share similar characteristics, with the exception of the ability to differentiate between personal and pre-personal experiences, a process known as individuation. In The Art of Loving (1956), social psychologist Erich Fromm explores these differences, suggesting that autonomy is necessary for empathy, which is not found in emotional contagion. Influencing factors There are several factors that determine the rate and extent of emotional convergence in a group. Some of these are: membership stability, mood-regulation norms, task interdependence and social interdependence. Besides these event-structure properties, there are personal properties of the group's members, such as openness to receive and transmit feelings, demographic characteristics and dispositional affect that influence the intensity of emotional contagion. =Research= Research regarding the concept of emotional contagion has been conducted from a variety of perspectives, including organizational, social, familial, developmental, and neurological contexts. While early research suggested that conscious reasoning, analysis, and imagination accounted for the idea of emotional contagion, it has been concluded that some forms of more primitive emotional contagion are far more subtle, automatic, and universal. Hatfield, Cacioppo, and Rapson's 1993 research into emotional contagion reported that people's conscious assessments of others' feelings were heavily influenced by what others said. People's own emotions, however, were more influenced by others' nonverbal clues as to what they were really feeling. Recognizing emotions and acknowledging their origin can be one way to avoid emotional contagion. Transference of emotions has been studied in a variety of situations and settings, with social and physiological causes being two of the largest areas of research. In addition to the social contexts discussed above, emotional contagion is a concept that has been studied within organizations. Schrock, Leaf, and Rohr (2008) discuss that organizations, like societies, have emotion cultures that consist of languages, rituals, and meaning systems, including rules about the feelings workers should, and should not, feel and display. They state that the concept of emotion culture is quite similar to the notion of \\"emotion climate\\" (p. 46), which has also been synonymously referred to as morale, organizational morale, and corporate morale. Furthermore, Worline, Wrzesniewski, and Rafaeli (2002) mention that organizations have an overall \\"emotional capability\\" (p. 318), while McColl- Kennedy and Smith (2006) examine the concept of \\"emotional contagion\\" (p. 255) specifically in customer interactions. These terms are arguably all attempting to describe a similar phenomenon; each term is different from one another in subtle and somewhat indistinguishable ways. Future research might consider where and how the meanings of these terms intersect, as well as how they differ. = Controversy = A controversial experiment demonstrating emotional contagion using the social media platform Facebook was carried out in 2012 on 689,000 users by filtering positive or negative emotional content from their news feeds. The experiment sparked uproar among people who felt the study violated personal privacy. The 2014 publication of a research paper resulting from this experiment, \\"Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks\\", a collaboration between Facebook and Cornell University, is described by Tony D. Sampson, Stephen Maddison, and Darren Ellis (2018) as a \\"disquieting disclosure that corporate social media and Cornell academics were so readily engaged with unethical experiments of this kind.\\" Tony D. Sampson et al. criticize the notion that ‚Äúacademic researchers can be insulated from ethical guidelines on the protection for human research subjects because they are working with a social media business that has ‚Äòno obligation to conform‚Äô to the principle of ‚Äòobtaining informed consent and allowing participants to opt out‚Äô.‚Äù A subsequent study confirmed the presence of emotional contagion on Twitter without manipulating users' timelines. Beyond the ethical concerns, some scholars criticized the methods and reporting of the Facebook findings. John Grohol, writing for Psych Central, argued that despite its title and claims of \\"emotional contagion,\\" this study did not look at emotions at all. Instead, its authors used an application (called \\"Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count\\" or LIWC 2007) that simply counted positive and negative words in order to infer users' sentiments. He wrote that a shortcoming of the LIWC tool is that it does not understand negations. Hence, the tweet \\"I am not happy\\" would be scored as positive: \\"Since the LIWC 2007 ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication, so do the researchers.\\" Grohol concluded that given these subtleties, the effect size of the findings are little more than a \\"statistical blip.\\" > Kramer et al. (2014) found a 0.07%‚Äîthat's not 7 percent, that's 1/15th of > one percent!!‚Äîdecrease in negative words in people's status updates when the > number of negative posts on their Facebook news feed decreased. Do you know > how many words you'd have to read or write before you've written one less > negative word due to this effect? Probably thousands. Types Emotions can be shared and mimicked in many different ways. Early investigators of emotional contagion believed that \\"conscious reasoning, analysis and imagination accounted for this phenomenon.\\" However, it is known now that some forms of emotional contagion are more subtle and automatic than early theorists suggested. =Implicit= Unlike cognitive contagion, emotional contagion is less conscious and more automatic. It relies mainly on non-verbal communication, although it has been demonstrated that emotional contagion can, and does, occur via telecommunication. For example, people interacting through e-mails and \\"chats\\" are affected by the other's emotions, without being able to perceive the non-verbal cues. One view, proposed by Hatfield and colleagues, describes the emotional contagion process as a primitive, automatic and unconscious behavior. According to this research group, it takes place through a series of steps. When a receiver is interacting with a sender, he perceives the emotional expressions of the sender. The receiver automatically mimics those emotional expressions. Through the process of afferent feedback, these new expressions are translated into feeling the emotions the sender feels, thus leading to emotional convergence. I Another view, emanating from social comparison theories, sees emotional contagion as demanding more cognitive effort and being more conscious. According to this view, people engage in social comparison to see if their emotional reaction is congruent with the persons around them. In this case, the recipient uses the emotion as a type of social information to understand how he or she should be feeling. People respond differentially to positive and negative stimuli, and negative events tend to elicit stronger and quicker emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses than neutral or positive events. Thus, unpleasant emotions are more likely to lead to mood contagion than are pleasant emotions. Another variable that needs to be taken into account is the energy level at which the emotion is displayed. As higher energy draws more attention to it, the prediction is that the same emotional valence (pleasant or unpleasant) expressed with high energy will lead to more contagion than if expressed with low energy. =Explicit= Contrary to the automatic infection of feelings described above, there are times when others' emotions are being manipulated by a person or a group in order to achieve something. This can be a result of intentional affective influence by a leader or team member. Suppose this person wants to convince the others of something, he may do so by sweeping them up in his enthusiasm. In such a case, his positive emotions are an act with the purpose of \\"contaminating\\" the others' feelings. A different kind of intentional mood contagion is by giving the group a reward, or treat, in order to alleviate their feelings. In the organizational psychology literature, a growing body of research is dedicated to the aspects of emotional labor. In short, it deals with the need to manage emotions so that they are consistent with organizational or occupational display rules, regardless of whether they are discrepant with internal feelings. In regard to emotional contagion, in work settings that require a certain display of emotions, one finds himself obligated to display, and consequently feel, these emotions. In a process where surface acting develops into deep acting, emotional contagion is the byproduct of intentional affective impression management. In workplaces and organizations =Intra- group= Many organizations and workplaces are currently encouraging team- work. This is a move driven by studies conducted by organizational psychologists that highlight the benefits of work-teams. Emotions come into play and a group emotion is formed. The group's emotional state has an influence on factors such as cohesiveness, morale, rapport and the team's performance. For this reason, organizations need to take into account the factors that shape the emotional state of the work-teams, in order to harness the beneficial sides and avoid the detrimental sides of the group's emotion. Managers and team leaders should be even more cautious with their behavior, since their emotional influence is greater than that of a \\"regular\\" team member. It has been shown that leaders are more emotionally \\"contagious\\" than others. =Employee/customer= The interaction between service employees and customers is considered an essential part of both customers' assessments of service quality and their relationship with the service provider. Positive affective displays in service interactions are positively associated with important customer outcomes, such as intention to return and to recommend the store to a friend. It is the interest of organizations that their customers be happy, since a happy customer is a satisfied one. Research has shown that the emotional state of the customer is directly influenced by the emotions displayed by the employee/service provider via emotional contagion. But, this influence is dependent on the degree of authenticity of the employee's emotional display, such that if the employee is only surface-acting, the contagion of the customer is poor, in which case the beneficial effects stated above will not occur. Neurological basis chimpanzees, dogs, cats, birds, and reptiles, and can occur across species. Vittorio Gallese posits that mirror neurons are responsible for intentional attunement in relation to others. Gallese and colleagues at the University of Parma found a class of neurons in the premotor cortex that discharge when macaque monkeys execute goal-related hand movements or when they watch others doing the same action. One class of these neurons fires with action execution and observation, and with sound production of the same action. Research in humans shows an activation of the premotor cortex and parietal area of the brain for action perception and execution. Gallese continues his dialogue to say humans understand emotions through a simulated shared body state. The observers' neural activation enables a direct experiential understanding. \\"Unmediated resonance\\" is a similar theory by Goldman and Sripada (2004). Empathy can be a product of the functional mechanism in our brain that creates embodied simulation. The other we see or hear becomes the \\"other self\\" in our minds. Other researchers have shown that observing someone else's emotions recruits brain regions involved in (a) experiencing similar emotions and (b) producing similar facial expressions. This combination of activations indicates that the observer activates (a) a representation of the emotional feeling of the other individual which would lead to emotional contagion and (b) a motor representation of the observed facial expression that could lead to facial mimicry. In the brain, understanding and sharing other individuals' emotions would thus be a combination of emotional contagion and facial mimicry. Importantly, more empathic individuals experience more brain activation in emotional regions while witnessing the emotions of other individuals. =Amygdala= The amygdala is one part of the brain mechanism that underlies empathy and allows for emotional attunement and creates the pathway for emotional contagion. The basal areas including the brain stem form a tight loop of biological connectedness, re-creating in one person the physiological state of the other. Psychologist Howard Friedman thinks this is why some people can move and inspire others. The use of facial expressions, voices, gestures and body movements transmit emotions to an audience from a speaker.

History Leighton Park was opened in 1890 by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), as a public school for boys. It was founded after Grove House School, also a Quaker school, closed in 1877. Grove School had educated notable personalities such as Lord Lister, Alfred Waterhouse and Thomas Hodgkin. Leighton Park grew from four boys in 1890 to 103 in the 1920s. The junior school became the independent Crosfields School, making Leighton Park solely a senior school. By 1970 the school had 300 pupils, and in 1975 girls were admitted to the sixth form. In 1993 the school became fully coeducational. Today the school is home to around 475 pupils drawn from over 32 different countries. In 2015, the school celebrated its 125-year anniversary.https://www.ukboardingschools.com/news/leighton-park-school- celebrates-125th-anniversary/ In March 2016, the school was granted planning permission to develop the main hall and music department into the Music and Media Centre (MMC) which will enhance the facilities for teaching Music and Media at the school. The building is scheduled to be finished in January 2019.https://www.leightonpark.com/about-the-school/facilities-development Traditions and routines Leighton Park, due to its Quaker heritage, has customs and traditions which differ from those in Anglican schools. These include: *\\"Collect\\": A daily meeting similar other schools' assemblies, in which pupils gather for presentations and talks. Every collect ends with a silence lasting several minutes to reflect on the topic addressed. Unlike many school assemblies, hymns are not sung. These generally occur on Mondays, Fridays and alternating Wednesdays. *\\"Meeting for Worship\\": A weekly event similar to Quaker meetings across the country. The meeting lasts about 20‚Äì25 minutes and is held in silence to reflect on thoughts and feelings, with a free forum for anyone to stand up and speak about issues on their mind. This occurs on Thursday mornings before lessons begin. *\\"Monthly Meeting\\": A meeting in which pupils can air grievances on any matter. It is usually chaired by the head boy and head girl. The school senior management are usually present to respond. These occur monthly on Tuesday mornings. *In the spirit of Quaker teachings, pupils and staff refer to each other on a first name basis in order to create a sense of equality.

Taniela Bolea was the original publisher. The majority shares were later owned by the Fijian government. The newspaper suspended publication and has remain closed since 2010. The FDP suffered criticism from its commencement in 1989 to its closure in 2010 that it represented an extreme ethnic Fijian/Itaukei viewpoint in Fiji's national discourse. The evidence for this conclusion is inconclusive. No other newspaper in Fiji has attempted to reach as wide a multicultural cross-section of the people as the FDP through the provision of five separate language publications. The staff of the newspaper was always multi-ethnic in complexion, representative of a wide range of religious and political viewpoints, and of both genders. As far as ideological orientation of the editorial staff is concerned, it is fair to suppose that once the Fiji government took an official role as major share- holder in the newspaper (late 1990s), the FDP was obliged to toe the government line, but again, this is an oversimplification of the facts. Content analysis of the FDP in comparison with Fiji's other major dailies, the Fiji Times and Fiji Sun does not bear this out. History The first Daily Post (Volume 1, No. 1) appeared as a 24-page tabloid with a red masthead, Saturday, 23 September 1989. The cover story, headlined ‚ÄòFiji Now Drugs Transit Point‚Äô, was by Karalaini Naciqa. That first edition contained court reports, special reports, an editorial, a feature on the Consumer Council, a children‚Äôs page, a page of international news, and a back page devoted to sport. The second edition of the FDP appeared Monday (25 September 1989, Volume 1, No.2) and carried the newspaper‚Äôs first ‚ÄòLetters to the Editor‚Äô. The newspaper listed Kameli Rakoko as ‚ÄòSports Editor‚Äô and Robert Wendt (now deceased) was named as ‚ÄòChief Sub-Editor‚Äô. In its first year, the newspaper served as an incubator for new journalists as well as a refuge for disaffected others. Stories and articles appeared by Mark Langan (former managing editor of the Samoa Daily News), Percy Kean, Filimoni Verebalavu, Kini Nalatu, Hari Gounder, and Kamal Iyer. In 1990 the FDP management was listed as Publisher, Taniela Bolea; Editor, Isimeli Koroi; Western Manager, Hari Gaunder; Accountant, Ashok Kumar; Advertising Manager, Simione Celua; Circulation Manager, John Singh; and Production Manager, Mohammad Ali. Four years into its operation, the FDP was, at the end of 1993, publishing editions of 40 to 68 pages varying according to daily demand and advertising. The publisher was still Taniela Bolea, but the Editor was Nemani Delaibatiki (replacing Isimeli Koroi). Ravin Lal had taken over as Advertising Manager (from Simione Celua), the Production manager was Aisea Itautoka (replacing Mohammed Ali), and Circulation was in the hands of Vishwa Nand (in place of John Singh). By 1994, Distribution was under Timoci Rabo; Systems Manager was John Mansell; and the Suva office under Elenoa Lagataki. \`Sidetracks‚Äô with the late (and great) Robert Keith-Reid was a popular column at that time. Cartoons were occasional with ‚ÄòMafi‚Äôs World‚Äô the feature. By 1997 Laisa Taga was Managing Editor (replacing Floyd Takeuchi and Nemani Delaibatiki), Greg Pooran had become Acting Advertising Manager and a new position of Marketing Manager was held by Andrew Joseph. Another new position of Financial Controller was held by Anura Bandara. In 1999, James Ah Koy, Finance Minister at the time, persuaded the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) government to purchase a majority holding in the newspaper to assist government in public dissemination and explanation of its legislation and policies. Despite government support, by 2000, the FDP was losing ground to the newly founded Fiji Sun. A new management group was thereby brought in to run the ailing newspaper. In 2005 the measures undertaken by that management group became the subject of Court action and criminal investigation brought on by the FDPs new Australian owner- publisher, Alan Hickling. Hickling had successfully bought a portion of both government and small share-holders' shares to acquire the newspaper. The government retained its reduced percentage of the FDP shares, while Alan Hickling increased his percentage shares giving him the controlling interest. During its time, the FDP was located at several addresses. It began as an office in Three Miles, Nabua (corner of Fletcher Road and Ratu Mara Road), before moving to Valelevu, Nasinu. The administration, editorial and advertising departments then split off and moved to Toorak (Toorak Road), Suva, leaving the press and production at Valelevu. The admin-ed-adv departments then moved downtown to Greig Street, Suva, before moving finally to Ackland Street, Vatuwaqa. The FDP has also been responsible for publishing several ethnic newspapers each with its own editorial staff under the supervision and control of the English-language newspaper. The ethnic Fijian (now known as 'itaukei') language newspaper called Volasiga began under Samisoni Bolatacigi almost simultaneously with the inception of the FDP. In the mid-1990s, an ethnic Rotuman-language newspaper, No'ia Rotuma, commenced under the editorial direction of Aisea Eiali. At this time, an ethnic Indian Hindi-language newspaper Ramnik Joyati also commenced under the FDP flagship. In the early 2000s, two ethnic Chinese-language newspapers were also published by the FDP. These were the Chinese Mail and the Chinese Post - each taking a different perspective of China's role in the world.  2006 coup d'√©tat  On Saturday, 2 December 2006 the FDP published what was alleged to be the military's timetable for taking control of the Qarase-led SDL government. The newspaper also reported that day that the incumbent Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase, would be removed from power on 4 December (2006). Both reports were wrong, but warnings and intimidation from unknown persons led to concerns about the safety of staff and the FDP premises were evacuated at 3.30 pm, on 4 December and remained closed for a period of 24 hours. A further threat prevented the FDP from publishing on 5 December 2006, but it was the only newspaper to publish on the day after the coup (6 December). On 8 December 2006, FDP General Manager, Mesake Koroi, was detained and questioned by soldiers at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks. Two days later, Koroi left for his village of Mavana on the Lau island of Vanua Balavu where he remained for three months. The newspaper continued to publish under Editor-in-Chief, Dr Robert Wolfgramm, News Editor, Mithleshni Gurdayal, and Legal Officer, Api Mataitoga. On 14 December 2006, Wolfgramm and Mataitoga were also taken to the military camp and detained for questioning whereupon Wolfgramm had his passport confiscated and was informed of his deportation to Australia. Wolfgramm's deportation was not followed through and his passport was returned to him through the Office of the Fiji Human Rights Commission on 5 January 2007. The FDP had been refusing to accept Military interference in its publications in the wake of the military coup which deposed the Qarase-led SDL government on 5 December 2006. In the two years leading up to the coup, numerous editorials were critical of the military leadership's position on the twice-elected government of deposed Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase. On 17 October 2008, the FDP published a letter-to-the-editor that was deemed to be in contempt of court by the Attorney-General. The letter was similar to that which was later published in the Fiji Times and for which the publishers and editors of both newspapers were charged and legal proceedings begun. The FDP case has not been resolved. Following the imposition of Fiji Public Emergency Regulations on 10 April 2009, censors were allocated to the newsrooms of all of Fiji's media including the FDP. Protests by various media against this measure initially took the forms of either black ink, blank spaces, or blurb. Eventually, the FDP negotiated a working relationship with this difficulty. In February 2010, suffering the combined effects of falling staff morale, shrinking circulation, censorship demands, and weighty unresolved court cases, the FDP suspended publication and closed.

It runs south from the United States Capitol to the D.C.‚ÄìMaryland line, intersecting with Southern Avenue. After it enters Maryland, the street becomes Indian Head Highway (Maryland Route 210) at the Eastover Shopping Center, a terminal or transfer point of many bus routes. History Map showing the route of Asylym Avenue {in red} east of Fort Carroll and Fort Greble, and below the bluffs the local roads which would eventually be the lower route of South Capitol Street. South Capitol Street from the United States Capitol to the Anacostia River was part of the L'Enfant Plan of streets for the District of Columbia. The Residence Act of 1790 gave President George Washington the authority to select the location for the national capital, and the area comprising the District of Columbia was chosen in late 1790. A surveying commission was chosen in January 1791, and in August 1791 Pierre Charles L'Enfant had delivered his plan for the city to Washington. Construction of the segment of South Capitol Street from the Capitol to the Anacostia River occurred over the decade, as the roadway was surveyed, trees were felled, brush and stumps removed, a roadway graded, and the street later paved with a variety of surfaces (wood blocks, granite blocks, oiled earth, aggregate, and macadam). The area east of the Anacostia River remained mostly farms and forest with few roads. The area was served primarily by the Navy Yard Bridge, constructed in 1820. The first residential development in the area was Uniontown (now the neighborhood of Anacostia), begun in 1854. The following year, the federal government constructed the Government Hospital for the Insane (later known as St. Elizabeths Hospital). To serve the hospital, Asylum Avenue was constructed from the Navy Yard Bridge to the new hospital and then, running on the east side of a line of hills, down to the District‚ÄìMaryland line. Additional construction in the area occurred during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). The United States Department of War constructed the George Washington Young cavalry magazine on of land on Giesborough Point. Two forts, Fort Carroll and Fort Greble, were constructed on the bluffs that began just west and adjacent to Asylum Road. After the war, the Barry Farm housing development for freed slaves opened in 1867 and was rapidly occupied. Aslyum Avenue was named Nichols Avenue in 1879 in honor of hospital superintendent Charles Henry Nichols. Asylum Avenue/Nichols Avenue was the only major southward road through the area until the 1890s, when the lower portion of South Capitol Street was constructed. A bridge connecting South Capitol Street to the area south of the Anacostia River was first proposed in 1889, but never acted on.; However, in 1890, Colonel Arthur E. Randle founded the settlement of Congress Heights. The development was wildly successful, and he invested heavily in the Belt Railway, a local streetcar company. In 1895, Randle founded the Capital Railway Company, which constructed streetcar lines over the Navy Yard Bridge and down Nichols Avenue to Congress Heights. The rapid development of Congress Heights and the areas adjacent to the streetcar line on Nichols Avenue led the government of the District of Columbia to extend South Capitol Street into the area east of the Anacostia River. The topography of the area largely dictated the route. Beginning near St. Elizabeths Hospital, a line of bluffs extended roughly southward until it reached what is now Chesapeake Street SW. (Fort Greble sat atop the southernmost of these cliffs.) To the west of these bluffs were broad, flat lowlands which provided views of the Potomac River and the city of Alexandria, Virginia. In 1893, the city surveyed South Capitol along the western side of these bluffs, laying out a broad avenue. Once the bluffs ended, the route followed existing local roads and curved eastward to connect with Livingston Road (now the Indian Head Highway) at the District-Maryland line. But because of the lack of development south of Congress Heights, South Capitol Street was only constructed to its intersection with Nichols Avenue. The two ends of South Capitol Street remained unconnected, however. Congress again considered building a South Capitol Street bridge in 1902 and 1926, but nothing came of these plans. The Army Corps of Engineers finally extended South Capitol Street from Nichols Avenue to the District boundary in 1940. Congress also approved a South Capitol Street bridge in 1940, but the onset of World War II prevented its funding and construction. The South Capitol Street bridge was finally constructed in 1949 at a cost of $5 million. It was dedicated to Frederick Douglass in October 1965. Route North of the Anacostia River, South Capitol Street runs in a straight north‚Äìsouth line. South Capitol Street begins at Southwest Drive, an access road on the south side of the grounds of the United States Capitol. It travels a half block south, and crosses Independence Avenue. Since roads on the grounds of the Capitol are closed to the public, this intersection has traditionally been the beginning of South Capitol Street. It widens from a two-lane to four-lane thoroughfare just before reaching Washington Avenue SE, and then passes beneath Interstate 695. Northbound traffic on South Capitol Street may access Interstate 695 westbound, and eastbound Interstate 695 traffic may leave the elevated highway and access southbound South Capitol Street. South Capitol Street passed beneath M Street SE/SW via an underpass, although access roads on both sides of South Capitol Street provide service either way on M Street. South Capitol Street bifurcates alongside Nationals Park, home of the Washington Nationals major league baseball team. Its last intersection north of the Anacostia River is with Potomac Avenue SE. South Capitol Street crosses the Anacostia via the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge, which is angled on a northwest‚Äìsoutheast line so that the bridge's southwest terminus does not occur on land owned by Joint Base Anacostia‚ÄìBolling. A \\"mixing bowl\\" of off- and on-ramps provides access to southbound Suitland Parkway, with an adjacent cloverleaf interchange giving access to Firth Sterling Avenue and the Anacostia Washington Metro station as well as northbound Interstate 295. South Capitol Street then follows a winding path along the eastern border of Joint Base Anacostia‚ÄìBolling. Deceleration lanes provide access to Malcolm X Avenue SE and the main gates of Joint Base Anacostia‚ÄìBolling and Interstate 295 again. South Capitol Street angles south-southeast at Overlook Avenue SW, passing below Interstate 295 and continues winding south-southeast until it reaches Southern Avenue. It is coterminous with Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE for a single block between Halley Place SE and 2nd Street SW before winding toward Southern Avenue and the District boundary line. The section of South Capitol Street between Washington Avenue SW and Suitland Parkway is part of the National Highway System. South Capitol Street forms the north-northeastern boundary of Oxon Run Park Taxation Without Representation Street The D.C. City Council attempted to rename a portion of South Capitol Street adjacent to Nationals Park in 2008 as \\"Taxation Without Representation Street\\" in order to bring attention to the city's lack of voting rights in Congress. The goal, according to advocates, was to boost awareness by changing the address of Nationals Park. The name change required congressional approval. Congress failed to act on the bill, and it never became law. References ;Notes ;Citations Bibliography    Streets in Washington, D.C.

It revolves around the themes of reality and illusionary beliefs, as do many of Dick's works. Additionally, it touches on Nazi ideology. Publication Dick originally published the story as a novelette in the magazine Fantastic, titled \\"The Novelty Act\\". He expanded the plot and titled the novel First Lady of Earth. Before publication, the title was changed to The Simulacra. The novel was originally published in 1964 as a paperback by Ace Books.\\"The Simulacra: Dick keeps his multiple story lines percolating\\". Fantasy Literature, by Sandy Ferber. It was one of four novels released by Dick that year.\\"Pulp, Packaged\\". New York Times, By DAVE ITZKOFF JUNE 24, 2007 Setting Set in the middle of the twenty-first century, after World War Three, The Simulacra is the story of several protagonists within the United States of Europe and America (USEA), formed by the merger of (West) Germany and the United States, where the whole government is a fraud and the President (der Alte, \\"the Old Man\\") is a simulacrum (android). Other global superpowers are the French Empire, People's Republic of China and Free (Black) Africa. The war may have involved tactical nuclear weapons. Poland has become the global focus of communist authority, with its administrative centre in Warsaw. Society is stratified into 'Ges' (German Geheimnistr√§ger, \\"bearers of the secret\\" (the elite)) and 'Bes' (German Befehlstr√§ger, \\"implementers of instruction\\" (professional and artisanal)) classes. Political and broadcast media power are highly consolidated. The Democratic and Republican parties have merged to become the 'Democrat-Republican Party' and the networks have amalgamated into the 'United Triadic Network'. Actual political power has devolved to a permanent First Lady, Nicole Thibodeaux, whose consorts are a series of male presidents ‚Äì die Alten. The current Alte, Rudi Kalbfleisch, is a simulacrum. Since the death of the original \\"Nicole\\", her role has been portrayed by four consecutive human actors, the latest of which is Kate Rupert. This is the Geheimnis (secret), possession of which ensures the conferral of elite Ges status. A secretive governing council controls the USEA; the manufacturer of the current der Alte-simulacrum, exerts some influence. Plot Kalbfleisch, whom Nicole dislikes, appears only momentarily in the story; because of planned obsolescence, he will soon suffer a heart attack and be replaced. The contract for the next simulacrum, Dieter Hogbein, has been awarded to 'Frauenzimmer Associates', and the previous contractor, 'Karp und S√∂hne Werke' is unhappy about this change. One subplot involves the Karp und S√∂hne Werke threatening exposure of what has been a state secret over the last five decades. A. G. Chemie, the leading USEA psycho-pharmaceutical drug cartel, has engineered the prohibition of psychotherapy under the \\"MacPhearson Act.\\" However, the USEA is willing to let Doctor Egon Superb continue to treat Richard Kongrosian, a well known pianist who performs in the White House, and who holds the delusory belief that his body odor is lethal. Kongrosian can play piano using only his telekinetic abilities; Nicole Thibodeaux is anxious to keep him under control, as are Wilder Pembroke, head of the National Police, and members of the covert national governance council. Bertold Goltz, an alleged neofascist, is seemingly trying to overthrow the government, and runs the 'Sons of Job', a religious paramilitary organisation. Actually, he is head of the covert USEA governing council. There is a subplot that involves Charles (Chic) Strikerock, Vince, his brother and a cut-price colonisation spacecraft sales firm (known as \\"Loony Lukes\\") involved in Martian colonisation. Mars boasts insectoid life, the sentient and empathic 'papoola', while Ganymede is inhabited by multicellular primitive life forms. As the plot develops, the der Alte- simulacrum is revealed as an android and Kate/Nicole is disclosed as an impostor, this undoing the raison d'etre for ges/bes class stratification. Bertold Goltz is killed by a National Police detachment, as is the rest of the covert governing council. Using telekinesis, Kongrosian kills Pembroke before he can overthrow Nicole in a coup d'√©tat and teleports her to safety at his secluded Northern US home. Karp und Sohnen rebel against the abortive coup, however, and soon the National Police and USEA armed forces are engaged in civil war, with active use of low-yield nuclear weapons. Re-emerging Neanderthals (or \\"chuppers\\"), happy at this turn of events, gather near Kongrosian's home in anticipation that self-destruction of Homo sapiens might give them another opportunity to dominate Earth.

It specializes in \\"security and resilience\\", and in collecting, managing and exploiting information to reveal so-called \\"actionable intelligence\\", \\"threat intelligence\\", \\"fraud containment\\" and customer insight. It also sells clients software for large-scale data exploitation, and analytics for intelligence- grade security and financial crime work. History The business was founded in 1971 as Smith Associates carrying out research on defence matters for the UK Government. It was incorporated in 1977 and renamed Detica in 2001. It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002. In 2003 Detica acquired Rubus, an Information Technology services company. It went on to launch Streamshield, an internet security software product, in 2004. In 2005 Detica acquired Extraprise UK, a systems integrator. In 2006 it bought the consultancy Evolution, the computer forensics business Inforenz and a financial service consultancy M.A. Partners. In 2007 it acquired the US homeland security consultancy DFI International. In July 2008, prospects of a bidding war for Detica emerged after BAE Systems made an informal offer. On 28 July 2008 the board of Detica and BAE Systems announced that the latter had made a formal cash offer of ¬£9.40 for all issued and to-be-issued share capital. After acquiring over 92% of outstanding shares with shareholder approval, BAE declared its offer for Detica unconditional on 25 September 2008. In 2010, BAE Systems acquired Stratsec, the largest cyber security consultancy in Australia. In 2011, BAE Systems acquired the Irish Norkom Technologies, a financial crime and financial compliance software maker, and the Danish cyber and intelligence company ETI/AS, which previously helped law enforcement and telecommunication providers in data-crime investigations. In 2013 it won an 8-year UK government service contract for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and partnered with Vodafone for smartphone and tablet security services. On 1 February 2014, BAE Systems Detica was renamed BAE Systems Applied Intelligence to reflect its ambitions for more global growth across its \\"Applied Intelligence portfolio\\". In October 2014, Kevin Taylor was appointed as Managing Director, following Martin Sutherland's departure to De La Rue. In December 2014 BAE Systems Applied Intelligence acquired Perimeter Internetworking Corp., trading as SilverSky, a commercial cyber services provider. In May 2017, Julian Cracknell took over from Kevin Taylor as Managing Director. In June 2017, an investigation by the BBC and the Danish newspaper Dagbladet Information showed that BAE Systems Applied Intelligence had been selling a mass surveillance technology called Evident to the governments of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Morocco and Algeria. An anonymous former employee of ETI, the Danish company which developed Evident and was bought by BAE Systems in 2011, told the BBC: \\"[With Evident,] you'd be able to intercept any internet traffic. If you wanted to do a whole country, you could. You could pin-point people's location based on cellular data. You could follow people around. They were quite far ahead with voice recognition. They were capable of decrypting stuff as well.\\" As the countries this equipment was sold to have poor human-rights records, there was criticism of the sales from campaign groups like Campaign Against Arms Trade and Privacy International. In response to the accusations, BAE Systems claimed: \\"\\"BAE systems works for a number of organisations around the world within the regulatory framework of all relevant countries and within our responsible trading principles.\\" During the Danish Business Authority's processing of the company's application to be allowed to export to Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar, it asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assess whether there was a risk of the product being used for human rights violations, as required by EU law, to which the full response was, each time, \\"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs finds no reason to object to the attached application\\". Operations The company claims four particular areas of expertise: cyber security; detection and prevention of financial crime; communications intelligence; and 'digital transformation'. The company operates in the following five main industrial sectors: national security and law enforcement; financial institutions (banking and insurance); telecommunications; civil government (including healthcare); transport, energy and utilities. Offices The company head office is in Guildford in the United Kingdom, with branch offices in 19 countries across Europe, North America, Australia, and Southeast Asia.

Count Gastone Brilli-Peri (24 March 1893 ‚Äì 22 March 1930) was an Italian racing driver, who won the 1925 Italian Grand Prix in an Alfa Romeo P2, securing the inaugural World Manufacturers' Championship title for Alfa Romeo. Known simply as \\"Brilli\\", his face had been permanently scarred in an accident during a Tour of Italy motorcycle race. He used to race wearing a hat similar to a Basque beret, which is now known in Italy as a brilliperi. Biography Brilli-Peri was born in Florence into a noble family. He debuted in a bicycle race in 1907, aged 14. In 1911 he won the Tuscan cycling championship. In 1912 he bought a motorcycle, and in 1914 he debuted in a race at the Lake Trasimeno, winning the 1st Motogiro of Italy in the same year. He first raced as car driver just after World War I, where he had acted as motorcycle driver. In 1925, in an Alfa Romeo P2, he won his first Grand Prix at the Italian Grand Prize at Monza. In 1929, still in the Alfa Romeo P2, he won the Circuit of Cremona and the Tripoli Grand Prix in Italian Libya. Brilli-Peri was killed in 1930 during Saturday practice for the sixth Tripoli Grand Prix. Free practice had been scheduled from 11am to 1:50pm and Brilli-Peri, who knew the track well having won the race one year earlier, came to test the cars of his team, the Scuderia Materassi. He first made one lap on his car, then moved to the vehicle of his teammate Clemente Biondetti, which had carburation problems. Brilli-Peri made one lap with Biondetti's car and then jumped again in his Talbot for another stint. However, during the second lap he crashed heavily near the village of Suq al Jum‚Äôah (also known as Suk el Giuma or Sugh el Giumaa (ÿ≥ŸàŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖÿπÿ©)) and was killed on impact. According to eyewitnesses, while negotiating a fast left-handed bend, the car bounced on the irregular surface of the track. Brilli-Peri could not control it anymore and went straight into the right embankment, being ejected from the vehicle. The accident happened around 12h50. The race (composed of two heats - the first of them for voiturettes only - and a final), was won by Baconin Borzacchini in a Maserati. Clemente Biondetti won the voiturette heat and was classified third in the final. Brilli-Peri died at the age of 37 years. Today the stadium of his native city, Montevarchi, is named in his honour. The Italian actress Nancy Brilli is a niece of Brilli-Peri.

The pervasive use of propaganda by the Nazis is largely responsible for the word propaganda itself acquiring its present negative connotations.Welch, 6. Propaganda in Mein Kampf Adolf Hitler devoted two chapters of his 1925 book Mein Kampf, itself a propaganda tool, to the study and practice of propaganda.These are chapter VI, \\"War Propaganda\\", and XI, \\"Propaganda and Organization\\". He claimed to have learned the value of propaganda as a World War I infantryman exposed to very effective British and ineffectual German propaganda., Welch, 10; see Mein Kampf, ch. VI. The argument that Germany lost the war largely because of British propaganda efforts, expounded at length in Mein Kampf, reflected then-common German nationalist claims. Although untrue ‚Äì German propaganda during World War I was mostly more advanced than that of the British ‚Äì it became the official truth of Nazi Germany thanks to its reception by Hitler.Welch, 11. Mein Kampf contains the blueprint of later Nazi propaganda efforts. Assessing his audience, Hitler writes in chapter VI: > Propaganda must always address itself to the broad masses of the people. > (...) All propaganda must be presented in a popular form and must fix its > intellectual level so as not to be above the heads of the least intellectual > of those to whom it is directed. (...) The art of propaganda consists > precisely in being able to awaken the imagination of the public through an > appeal to their feelings, in finding the appropriate psychological form that > will arrest the attention and appeal to the hearts of the national masses. > The broad masses of the people are not made up of diplomats or professors of > public jurisprudence nor simply of persons who are able to form reasoned > judgment in given cases, but a vacillating crowd of human children who are > constantly wavering between one idea and another. (...) The great majority > of a nation is so feminine in its character and outlook that its thought and > conduct are ruled by sentiment rather than by sober reasoning. This > sentiment, however, is not complex, but simple and consistent. It is not > highly differentiated, but has only the negative and positive notions of > love and hatred, right and wrong, truth and falsehood.Mein Kampf citations > are from the Project Gutenberg-hosted 1939 English translation by James > Murphy As to the methods to be employed, he explains: > Propaganda must not investigate the truth objectively and, in so far as it > is favorable to the other side, present it according to the theoretical > rules of justice; yet it must present only that aspect of the truth which is > favorable to its own side. (...) The receptive powers of the masses are very > restricted, and their understanding is feeble. On the other hand, they > quickly forget. Such being the case, all effective propaganda must be > confined to a few bare essentials and those must be expressed as far as > possible in stereotyped formulas. These slogans should be persistently > repeated until the very last individual has come to grasp the idea that has > been put forward. (...) Every change that is made in the subject of a > propagandist message must always emphasize the same conclusion. The leading > slogan must, of course, be illustrated in many ways and from several angles, > but in the end one must always return to the assertion of the same formula. History of Nazi propaganda =Early Nazi Party (1919‚Äì33)= Hitler put these ideas into practice with the reestablishment of the V√∂lkischer Beobachter, a daily newspaper published by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) from February 1925 onwards, whose circulation reached 26,175 in 1929. It was joined in 1927 by Joseph Goebbels's Der Angriff, another unabashedly and crudely propagandistic paper. During most of the Nazis' time in opposition, their means of propaganda remained limited. With little access to mass media, the party continued to rely heavily on Hitler and a few others speaking at public meetings until 1929. One study finds that the Weimar government's use of pro- government radio propaganda slowed Nazi growth. In April 1930, Hitler appointed Goebbels head of party propaganda. Goebbels, a former journalist and Nazi party officer in Berlin, soon proved his skills. Among his first successes was the organization of riotous demonstrations that succeeded in having the American anti-war film All Quiet on the Western Front banned in Germany.Welch, 14. =In power (1933‚Äì39)= A 1937 anti-Bolshevik Nazi propaganda poster. The translated caption: \\"Bolshevism without a mask ‚Äì large anti-Bolshevik exhibition of the NSDAP Gauleitung Berlin from November 6, 1937 to December 19, 1937 in the Reichstag building\\". On 13 March 1933, the Third Reich established a Ministry of Propaganda, appointing Joseph Goebbels as its Minister. Its goals were to establish enemies in the public mind: the external enemies which had imposed the Treaty of Versailles on Germany, and internal enemies such as Jews, Romani, homosexuals, Bolsheviks, and cultural trends including \\"degenerate art\\". A major political and ideological cornerstone of Nazi policy was the unification of all ethnic Germans living outside the Reich's borders (e.g. in Austria and Czechoslovakia) under one Greater Germany. In Mein Kampf, Hitler denounced the pain and misery of ethnic Germans outside Germany, and declared the dream of a common fatherland for which all Germans must fight.Hitler, Adolf. Mein Kampf. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999 Throughout Mein Kampf, he pushed Germans worldwide to make the struggle for political power and independence their main focus, made official in the Heim ins Reich policy beginning in 1938. For months prior to the beginning of World War II in 1939, German newspapers and leaders had carried out a national and international propaganda campaign accusing Polish authorities of organizing or tolerating violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland. On 22 August, Adolf Hitler told his generals: The main part of this propaganda campaign was the false flag Operation Himmler, which was designed to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany, in order to justify the invasion of Poland. Research finds that the Nazis' use of radio propaganda helped it consolidate power and enroll more party members. There are a variety of factors that increased the obedience of German soldiers in terms of following the Nazi orders that were given to them regarding Jews. Omer Bartov, a professor on subjects such as German Studies and European History, mentioned in his book, ‚ÄúHitler‚Äôs Army: Soldiers, Nazis, and War in the Third Reich‚Äù, how German soldiers were told information that influenced their actions. Bartov mentioned that General Lemelson, a corps commander, explained to his German troops regarding their actions toward Jews, ‚ÄúWe want to bring back peace, calm and order to this land‚Ä¶‚Äù German leaders tried to make their soldiers believe that Jews were a threat to their society. Thus, German soldiers followed orders given to them and participated in the demonization and mass murders of Jews. In other words, German soldiers saw Jews as a group that was trying to infect and take over their homeland. Omer Bartov‚Äôs description of the Third Reich explains the intense discipline and unity that the soldiers had which played a role in their willingness to obey orders that were given to them. These feelings that German soldiers had toward Jews grew more and more as time went on as the German leaders kept pushing further for Jews to get out of their land as they wanted total annihilation of Jews.  Anti-semitism  \\"He is to blame for this war!\\" by Hans Schweitzer Adolf Hitler and Nazi propagandists played on widespread and long-established German anti-Semitism. The Jews were blamed for things such as robbing the German people of their hard work while themselves avoiding physical labour. Hitler declared that the mission of the Nazi movement was to annihilate \\"Jewish Bolshevism\\", which was also called \\"Cultural Bolshevism\\".Kershaw, p.257 Hitler asserted that the \\"three vices\\" of \\"Jewish Marxism\\" were democracy, pacifism and internationalism,Kershaw, p.303 and that the Jews were behind Bolshevism, communism and Marxism.Kershaw, p.259 Joseph Goebbels in 1937 The Great Anti- Bolshevist Exhibition declared that Bolshevism and Jewry were one and the same. At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels declared that \\"Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself.\\"Goebbels speech at the 1935 Nuremberg Rally Der St√ºrmer, a Nazi propaganda newspaper, told Germans that Jews kidnapped small children before Passover because \\"Jews need the blood of a Christian child, maybe, to mix in with their Matzah.\\" Posters, films, cartoons, and fliers were seen throughout Germany which attacked the Jewish community. One of the most infamous such films was The Eternal Jew directed by Fritz Hippler. A study finds that the Nazis' use of radio propaganda incited anti-Semitic acts. Nazi radio was most effective in places where anti-Semitism was historically high but had a negative effect in places with historically low anti-Semitism.  Euthanasia  The Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring was introduced on 14 July 1933, and various propaganda was used to target the disabled. A special euthanasia program, called Aktion T4 began in 1939, related propaganda arguments were based on the books, Die Freigabe der Vernichtung lebensunwerten Lebens (\\"Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Living\\"), written by Karl Binding and Alfred Hoche and the book Human Heredity Theory and Racial Hygiene, written by Eugen Fischer, Erwin Baur and Fritz Lenz.  Nuremberg Laws  In 1935, anti-semitic laws in Nazi Germany were introduced known as the Nuremberg Laws, the laws excluded non-Aryans and political opponents of the Nazis from the civil-service and any sexual relations and marriage between people classified as \\"Aryan\\" and \\"non- Aryan\\" (Jews, Romani, Blacks) was prohibited as Rassenschande or \\"race defilement\\". The Nuremberg Laws were based on notions of racial purity and sought to preserve the Aryan race, who were at the top of the Nazi racial hierarchy and were said to be the √úbermenschen \\"Herrenvolk\\" (master race), and to teach the German nation to view the Jews as subhumans.  Political opponents  Soon after the takeover of power in 1933, Nazi concentration camps were established for political opponents. The first people that were sent to the camps were political opponents, especially communists and socialists.M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten, 21 March 1933, online scan They were sent because of their ties with the Soviet Union and because Nazism greatly opposed Communism. Nazi propaganda dismissed the Communists as \\"Red subhumans\\".Michael Burleigh, The Third Reich: A New History, p.144 Goebbels used the death of the Nazi Party's Sturmabteilung (SA) Berlin leader Horst Wessel who was killed in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party of Germany as a propaganda tool for the Nazis against \\"Communist subhumans\\".Daniel Siemens, The Making of a Nazi Hero: The Murder and Myth of Horst Wessel., p.143  Treaty of Versailles  When the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, non-propagandists newspapers headlines across the nation spoke German's feelings, such as \\"Sch√§ndlich!\\" (\\"Shameful!\\") which appeared on the front page of the Frankfurter Zeitung in 1919. The Berliner Tageblatt, also in 1919, predicted: \\"Should we accept the conditions, a military furore for revenge will sound in Germany within a few years, a militant nationalism will engulf all.\\"Abel, Theodore. Why Hitler Came into Power. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1986. Hitler, knowing his nation's disgust with the Treaty, used it as leverage to influence his audience. He would repeatedly refer back to the terms of the Treaty as a direct attack on Germany and its people. In one speech delivered on 30 January 1937 he directly stated that he was withdrawing the German signature from the document to protest the outrageous proportions of the terms. He claimed the Treaty made Germany out to be inferior and \\"less\\" of a country than others only because blame for the war was placed on it. The success of Nazi propagandists and Hitler won the Nazi party control of Germany and eventually led to World War II.German Propaganda Archive, \\"Hitler Speech\\" 2004.

Until the conclusion of the Battle of Stalingrad on 2 February 1943, German propaganda emphasized the prowess of German arms and the humanity German soldiers had shown to the peoples of occupied territories. Pilots of the Allied bombing fleets were depicted as cowardly murderers and Americans in particular as gangsters in the style of Al Capone. At the same time, German propaganda sought to alienate Americans and British from each other, and both these Western nations from the Soviet Union. One of the primary sources for propaganda was the Wehrmachtbericht, a daily radio broadcast from the High Command of the Wehrmacht, the OKW. Nazi victories lent themselves easily to propaganda broadcasts and were at this point difficult to mishandle. Satires on the defeated, accounts of attacks, and praise for the fallen all were useful for Nazis. Still, failures were not easily handled even at this stage. For example, considerable embarrassment resulted when the Ark Royal proved to have survived an attack that German propaganda had hyped. Goebbels instructed Nazi propagandists to describe the invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) as the ‚ÄúEuropean crusade against Bolshevism‚Äù and the Nazis then formed different units of the Waffen-SS consisting of mainly volunteers and conscripts. After Stalingrad, the main theme changed to Germany as the sole defender of what they called \\"Western European culture\\" against the \\"Bolshevist hordes\\". The introduction of the V-1 and V-2 \\"vengeance weapons\\" was emphasized to convince Britons of the hopelessness of defeating Germany. Problems in propaganda arose easily in this stage; expectations of success were raised too high and too quickly, which required explanation if they were not fulfilled, and blunted the effects of success, and the hushing of blunders and failures caused mistrust. The increasing hardship of the war for the German people also called forth more propaganda that the war had been forced on the German people by the refusal of foreign powers to accept their strength and independence. Goebbels called for propaganda to toughen up the German people and not make victory look easy. Nur f√ºr deutsche Fahrg√§ste (\\"Only for German Passengers\\"), a Nazi slogan used in occupied territories, mainly posted at entrances to parks, cafes, cinemas, theatres and other facilities. On 23 June 1944, the Nazis permitted the Red Cross to visit the concentration camp Theresienstadt to dispel rumors about the Final Solution, which was intended to kill all Jews. In reality, Theresienstadt was a transit camp for Jews en route to extermination camps. In a sophisticated propaganda effort, fake shops and caf√©s were erected to imply that the Jews lived in relative comfort. The guests enjoyed the performance of a children's opera, Brundibar, written by inmate Hans Kr√°sa. The hoax was so successful for the Nazis that they went on to make a propaganda film Theresienstadt. The shooting of the film began on 26 February 1944. Directed by Kurt Gerron, it was meant to show how well the Jews lived under the \\"benevolent\\" protection of the Third Reich. After the shooting, most of the cast, and even the filmmaker himself, were deported to the concentration camp of Auschwitz where they were murdered. Hans Fritzsche, who had been head of the Radio Chamber, was tried and acquitted by the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal. Anti-Semitism during World War II Anti- semitic wartime propaganda served a variety of purposes. It was hoped that people in Allied countries would be persuaded that Jews should be blamed for the war. The Nazis also wished to ensure that German people were aware of the extreme measures being carried out against the Jews on their behalf, in order to incriminate them and thus guarantee their continued loyalty through fear by Nazi-conjectured scenarios of supposed post-war \\"Jewish\\" reprisals.Richard Breitman et al. (2005). OSS Knowledge of the Holocaust. In: U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis. pp. 11‚Äì44. [Online]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Available from: Cambridge Books Online [Accessed 21 April 2016]. page 27 Especially from 1942 onwards, Nazi media vilified arch-enemies of Nazi Germany as Jewish (Franklin Delano Roosevelt) https://research.calvin.edu/german- propaganda-archive/franklin-roosevelt.htm or in the cases of Josef Stalin and Sir Winston Churchill abject puppets of an international Jewish conspiracy intent on ruining Germany and Nazism.https://www.bytwerk.com/gpa/winstonchurchill.htm Media =Books= The Nazis and sympathizers published many books. Most of the beliefs that would become associated with the Nazis, such as German nationalism, eugenics and anti-Semitism had been in circulation since the 19th century, and the Nazis seized on this body of existing work in their own publications. The most notable is Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf detailing his beliefs. The book outlines major ideas that would later culminate in World War II. It is heavily influenced by Gustave Le Bon's 1895 The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, which theorized propaganda as a way to control the seemingly irrational behaviour of crowds. Particularly prominent is the violent anti-Semitism of Hitler and his associates, drawing, among other sources, on the fabricated \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" (1897), which implied that Jews secretly conspired to rule the world. This book was a key source of propaganda for the Nazis and helped fuel their common hatred against the Jews during World War II. For example, Hitler claimed that the international language Esperanto was part of a Jewish plot and makes arguments toward the old German nationalist ideas of \\"Drang nach Osten\\" and the necessity to gain Lebensraum (\\"living space\\") eastwards (especially in Russia). Other books such as Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes (\\"Racial Science of the German People\\") by Hans G√ºnther and Rasse und Seele (\\"Race and Soul\\") by Dr. (published under different titles between 1926 and 1934) attempt to identify and classify the differences between the German, Nordic, or Aryan type and other supposedly inferior peoples. These books were used as texts in German schools during the Nazi era. The pre-existing and popular genre of Schollen-roman, or novel of the soil, also known as blood and soil novels,Richard Grunberger, The 12-Year Reich, p 351, was given a boost by the acceptability of its themes to the Nazis and developed a mysticism of unity.Pierre Aycoberry The Nazi Question, p8 Pantheon Books New York 1981 The immensely popular \\"Red Indian\\" stories by Karl May were permitted despite the heroic treatment of the hero Winnetou and \\"colored\\" races; instead, the argument was made that the stories demonstrated the fall of the Red Indians was caused by a lack of racial consciousness, to encourage it in the Germans.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p. 79 Other fictional works were also adapted; Heidi was stripped of its Christian elements, and Robinson Crusoe's relationship to Friday was made a master-slave one. Children's books also made their appearance. In 1938, Julius Streicher published Der Giftpilz (The Poisonous Mushroom), a storybook that equated the Jewish people to poisonous mushrooms and aimed to educate children about the Jews. The book was an example of anti-Semitic propaganda and stated that \\"The following tales tell the truth about the Jewish poison mushroom. They show the many shapes the Jew assumes. They show the depravity and baseness of the Jewish race. They show the Jew for what he really is: The Devil in human form.\\" Textbooks \\"Geopolitical atlases\\" emphasized Nazi schemes, demonstrating the \\"encirclement\\" of Germany, depicting how the prolific Slav nations would cause the German people to be overrun, and (in contrast) showing the relative population density of Germany was much higher than that of the Eastern regions (where they would seek Lebensraum).Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p. 76 Textbooks would often show that the birth rate amongst Slavs was prolific compared to Germans.Otto Helmut, \\"Fertility and Race: The Growth of the Slavs in Europe\\", Volk in Gefahr, (1938) Geography text books stated how crowded Germany had become. Other charts would show the cost of disabled children as opposed to healthy ones, or show how two-child families threatened the birthrate. Math books discussed military applications and used military word problems, physics and chemistry concentrated on military applications, and grammar classes were devoted to propaganda sentences.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p. 77 Other textbooks dealt with the history of the Nazi Party. Elementary school reading text included large amounts of propaganda. Children were taught through textbooks that they were the Aryan master race (Herrenvolk) while the Jews were untrustworthy, parasitic and Untermenschen (inferior subhumans). Course content and textbooks unnecessarily included information that was propagandistic, an attempt to sway the children's views from an early age. Maps showing the racial composition of Europe were banned from the classroom after many efforts that did not define the territory widely enough for party officials. Fairy tales were put to use, with Cinderella being presented as a tale of how the prince's racial instincts lead him to reject the stepmother's alien blood (present in her daughters) for the racially pure maiden.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p. 77-8 Nordic sagas were likewise presented as the illustration of F√ºhrerprinzip, which was developed with such heroes as Frederick the Great and Otto von Bismarck.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p. 78 Literature was to be chosen within the \\"German spirit\\" rather than a fixed list of forbidden and required, which made the teachers all the more cautiousMilton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933‚Äì45 p194 1995 University of Chicago Press Chicago although Jewish authors were impossible for classrooms.Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933‚Äì45 p192 1995 University of Chicago Press Chicago While only William Shakespeare's Macbeth and The Merchant of Venice were actually recommended, none of the plays were actually forbidden, even Hamlet, denounced for \\"flabbiness of soul.\\"Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933‚Äì45 p193 1995 University of Chicago Press Chicago Biology texts, however, were put to the most use in presenting eugenic principles and racial theories; this included explanations of the Nuremberg Laws, which were claimed to allow the German and Jewish peoples to co-exist without the danger of mixing.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p. 85 Science was to be presented as the most natural area for introducing the \\"Jewish Question\\" once teachers took care to point out that in nature, animals associated with those of their own species. Teachers' guidelines on racial instruction presented both the handicapped and Jews as dangers. Despite their many photographs glamorising the \\"Nordic\\" type, the texts also claimed that visual inspection was insufficient, and genealogical analysis was required to determine their types and report any hereditary problems.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p. 86 However, the National Socialist Teachers League (NSLB) stressed that at primary schools, in particular, they had to work on only the Nordic racial core of the German Volk again and again and contrast it with the racial composition of foreign populations and the Jews. Books for occupied countries In occupied France, the German Institute encouraged the translation of German works although chiefly German nationalists, not ardent Nazis, produced a massive increase in the sale of translated works. The only books in English to be sold were English classics, and books with Jewish authors or Jewish subject matter (such as biographies) were banned, except for some scientific works. Control of the paper supply allowed Germans the easy ability to pressure publishers about books. =Comics= The Nazi-controlled government in German-occupied France produced the Vica comic book series during World War II as a propaganda tool against the Allied forces. The Vica series, authored by Vincent Krassousky, represented Nazi influence and perspective in French society, and included such titles as Vica contre le service secret anglais, and Vica d√©fie l'Oncle Sam. =Films= thumbLeni Riefenstahl with Heinrich Himmler at Nuremberg in 1934 The Totenehrung (honouring of dead) at the 1934 Nuremberg Rally. SS leader Heinrich Himmler, Adolf Hitler and SA leader Viktor Lutze (from L to R) on the stone terrace in front of the Ehrenhalle (Hall of Honour) in the Luitpoldarena. In the background is the crescent-shaped Ehrentrib√ºne (literally: tribune of honour). The Nazis produced many films to promote their views, using the party's Department of Film for organizing film propaganda. An estimated 45 million people attended film screenings put on by the NSDAP. Reichsamtsleiter Neumann declared that the goal of the Department of Film was not directly political in nature, but was rather to influence the culture, education, and entertainment of the general population. On 22 September 1933, a Department of Film was incorporated into the Chamber of Culture. The department controlled the licensing of every film prior to its production. Sometimes the government selected the actors for a film, financed the production partially or totally, and granted tax breaks to the producers. Awards for \\"valuable\\" films would decrease taxes, thus encouraging self-censorship among movie makers. Under Goebbels and Hitler, the German film industry became entirely nationalised. The National Socialist Propaganda Directorate, which Goebbels oversaw, had at its disposal nearly all film agencies in Germany by 1936. Occasionally, certain directors such as Wolfgang Liebeneiner were able to bypass Goebbels by providing him with a different version of the film than would be released. Such films include those directed by Helmut K√§utner: Romanze in Moll (Romance in a Minor Key, 1943), Gro√üe Freiheit Nr. 7 (The Great Freedom, No. 7, 1944), and Unter den Br√ºcken (Under the Bridges, 1945). Schools were also provided with motion picture projectors because the film was regarded as particularly appropriate for propagandizing children.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, p21 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York Films specifically created for schools were termed \\"military education.\\" Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will, 1935) by film-maker Leni Riefenstahl chronicled the Nazi Party Congress of 1934 in Nuremberg. It followed an earlier film of the 1933 Nuremberg Rally produced by Riefenstahl, Der Sieg des Glaubens. Triumph of the Will features footage of uniformed party members (though relatively few German soldiers), who are marching and drilling to militaristic tunes. The film contains excerpts from speeches given by various Nazi leaders at the Congress, including Adolf Hitler. Frank Capra used scenes from the film, which he described partially as \\"the ominous prelude of Hitler's holocaust of hate\\", in many parts of the United States government's Why We Fight anti-Axis seven-film series, to demonstrate what the personnel of the American military would be facing in World War II, and why the Axis had to be defeated. Der ewige Jude (The Eternal Jew, 1940) was directed by Fritz Hippler at the insistence of Goebbels, though the writing is credited to Eberhard Taubert. The movie is done in the style of a documentary, the central thesis being the immutable racial personality traits that characterize the Jew as a wandering cultural parasite. Throughout the film, these traits are contrasted to the Nazi state ideal: while Aryan men find satisfaction in physical labour and the creation of value, Jews only find pleasure in money and a hedonist lifestyle. The main medium was Die Deutsche Wochenschau, a newsreel series produced for cinemas, from 1940. Newsreels were explicitly intended to portray German interests as successful.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, p32 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York Themes often included the virtues of the Nordic or Aryan type, German military and industrial strength, and the evils of the Nazi enemies. =Fine art= Arno Breker's sculptures of the Nordic man made him Hitler's favorite sculptor. By Nazi standards, fine art was not propaganda. Its purpose was to create ideals, for eternity. This produced a call for heroic and romantic art, which reflected the ideal rather than the realistic. Explicitly political paintings were very rare. Still more rare were anti-Semitic paintings, because the art was supposed to be on a higher plane. Nevertheless, selected themes, common in propaganda, were the most common topics of art. Sculpture was used as an expression of Nazi racial theories. The most common image was of the nude male, expressing the ideal of the Aryan race. Nudes were required to be physically perfect.Susan Sontag, Fascinating Fascism At the Paris Exposition of 1937, Josef Thorak's Comradeship stood outside the German pavilion, depicting two enormous nude males, clasping hands and standing defiantly side by side, in a pose of defense and racial camaraderie. Landscape painting featured mostly heavily in the Greater German Art exhibition, in accordance with themes of blood and soil. Peasants were also popular images, reflecting a simple life in harmony with nature, frequently with large families.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, p25 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York With the advent of war, war art came to be a significant though still not predominating proportion. The continuing of the German Art Exhibition throughout the war was put forth as a manifestation of German's culture. =Magazines= In and after 1939, the Zeitschriften-Dienst was sent to magazines to provide guidelines on what to write for appropriate topics. Nazi publications also carried various forms of propaganda. Neues Volk was a monthly publication of the Office of Racial Policy, which answered questions about acceptable race relations. While mainly focused on race relations, it also included articles about the strength and character of the Aryan race compared to Jews and other \\"defectives\\". The NS-Frauen-Warte, aimed at women, included such topics as the role of women in the Nazi state. Despite its propaganda elements, it was predominantly a women's magazine.Leila J. Rupp, Mobilizing Women for War, p 45, , It defended anti-intellectualism, urged women to have children, even in wartime, put forth what the Nazis had done for women, discussed bridal schools, and urged women to greater efforts in total war. Der Pimpf was aimed at boys, and contained both adventure and propaganda. Das deutsche M√§del, in contrast, recommended that girls take up hiking, tending the wounded, and preparing to care for children. Far more than NS-Frauen-Warte, it emphasized the strong and active German woman. Signal Signal was a propaganda magazine published by the Wehrmacht during World War II and distributed throughout occupied Europe and neutral countries. Published from April 1940 to March 1945, \\"Signal\\" had the highest sales of any magazine published in Europe during the period‚Äîcirculation peaked at 2.5 million in 1943. At various times, it was published in at least twenty languages. An English edition was distributed in the British Channel Islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, and Sark, which were occupied by the Wehrmacht during the war. The promoter of the magazine was the chief of the Wehrmacht propaganda office, Colonel Hasso von Wedel. Its annual budget was 10 million Reichmarks, roughly $2.5 million at the pre-war exchange rate. The image that Signal transmitted was that of Nazi Germany and its New Order as the great benefactor of European peoples and of Western civilization in general. The danger of a Soviet invasion of Europe was strongly pointed out. The quality of the magazine itself was quite high, featuring complete reviews from the front lines rich in information and photos, even displaying a double center-page full-colour picture. In fact, many of the most famous Second World War photos that are to be seen today come from Signal. The magazine contained little to no anti-Semitic propaganda, as the contents were mainly military.Meyer, S.L. Signal:Hitler's Wartime Picture Magazine London:1976 Bison Publishing Co. Introduction, Pages 1‚Äì2 =Newspapers= The V√∂lkischer Beobachter (\\"People's Observer\\") was the official daily newspaper of the NSDAP since December 1920. It disseminated Nazi ideology in the form of brief hyperboles directed against the weakness of parliamentarism, the evils of Jewry and Bolshevism, the national humiliation of the Versailles Treaty and other such topics.Welch, 12. It was joined in 1926 by Der Angriff (\\"The Attack\\"), a weekly and later daily paper founded by Joseph Goebbels. It was mainly dedicated to attacks against political opponents and Jews ‚Äì one of its most striking features were vehemently antisemitic cartoons by Hans Schweitzer ‚Äì but also engaged in the glorification of Nazi heroes such as Horst Wessel.Welch, 13. The Illustrierter Beobachter was their weekly illustrated paper. Other Nazi publications included; * Das Reich, a more moderate and highbrow publication aimed at intellectuals and foreigners; * Der St√ºrmer, the most virulently antisemitic of all; * Das Schwarze Korps, an SS publication, aiming at a more intellectual tone. After Hitler's rise to power in 1933, all of the regular press came under complete Nazi editorial control through the policy of Gleichschaltung, and short-lived propaganda newspapers were also established in the conquered territories during World War II. Alfred Rosenberg was a key member of the Nazi party who gained control of their newspaper which was openly praised by Hitler. However, Hitler was dissatisfied by Rosenberg's work and slandered Rosenberg behind his back, discrediting his work. Newspapers in occupied countries In Ukraine, after Nazis cracked down on the papers, most papers printed only articles from German agencies, producing the odd effect of more anti-American and anti-British articles than anti-Communist ones. They also printed articles about antecedents of German rule over Ukraine, such as Catherine the Great and the Goths. =Photography= Adolf Hitler rehearsing poses for his speeches in photos reportedly taken in 1927. The Nazis used photographers to document events and promote ideology. Photographers included Heinrich Hoffmann and Hugo Jaeger. Hoffmann worked in his father's photographic shop and as a photographer in Munich from 1908. He joined the NSDAP on 6 April 1920. After Hitler took over the party in 1921, he named Hoffmann as his official photographer, a post he held for over a quarter- century. A photograph taken by Hoffmann in Munich's Odeonsplatz on 2 August 1914 show a young Hitler among the crowds cheering the outbreak of World War I and was used in Nazi propaganda. Hitler and Hoffmann became close friends‚Äîin fact, when Hitler became the ruler of Germany, Hoffmann was the only man authorized to take official photographs of him. Hoffmann's photographs were published as postage stamps, postcards, posters and picture books. Following Hoffmann's suggestion, both he and Hitler received royalties from all uses of Hitler's image (even on postage stamps), which made Hoffmann a millionaire. In 1933 he was elected to the Reichstag and in 1938 Hitler appointed him a 'Professor'. Hitler's field headquarters, Hitler with staff, May or June 1940, Heinrich Hoffmann front row far right Nine photographs taken by Hoffman reveal how Hitler rehearsed poses and his hand gestures. He asked Hoffmann to take pictures so that he could see how he looked while speaking. Egon Hanfstaengl, son of Hitler's one-time foreign press officer Ernst \\"Putzi\\" Hanfstaengl, said in a documentary, Fatal Attraction of Hitler: \\"He had that ability which is needed to make people stop thinking critically and just emote.\\" =Posters= \\"We have only one goal... Victory at all costs!\\" ‚Äî Parole der Woche 29 April 1942 Wochenspruch der NSDAP 11 January 1943 quotes Hermann G√∂ring: \\"We do not want to leave to our children and descendants what we can do ourselves.\\" Poster art was a mainstay of the Nazi propaganda effort, aimed both at Germany itself and occupied territories. It had several advantages. The visual effect, being striking, would reach the viewer easily.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, p22 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York Posters were also, unlike other forms of propaganda, difficult to avoid.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, p24 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York Imagery frequently drew on heroic realism. Nazi youth and the SS were depicted monumentally, with lighting posed to produce grandeur. Parole der Woche wall newspapers were published by the Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda of the Third Reich. The first edition was distributed on 16 March 1936. Every week an estimated 125,000 posters were administered to the public from 1936 to 1943. Word of the Week posters were politically skewed and meant to rally public opinion in support of the Nazi efforts. The posters set out to educate and unify the German people before and especially during World War II. The posters were placed in train cars, buses, platforms, ticket windows ‚Äì anywhere there was dense traffic flow. Very few individuals, at the time, owned a car, most biked, walked, or used public transportation daily. Exposure to the Word of the Week posters was high in German cities. The messages and Nazi ideologies \\"stared out at the mass public for a week at a time in tens of thousands of places German pedestrians were likely to pass in the course of a day\\". Jeffery Herf, author of The Jewish Enemy: Nazi Propaganda During World War II and the Holocaust, described the poster campaign as a \\"combination of newspaper editorial, political leaflet, political poster, and tabloid journalism\\".Adolf Hitler personally appointed artist Hans Schweitzer, known as Mj√∂lnir, with the task of translating Nazi ideology into images for the wall newspaper. The posters were 100 centimeters high and 212 centimeters wide. The visual style of the posters was bold text and Nazi influenced colors, it meant to capture the attention of the German passersby. The text was big so that several people could read it at the same time and from a distance of a few feet. The majority of the posters were centered on Jews and the Allied countries of Great Britain, the United States of America and Russia. During the time period when anti-Semitic articles decreased in publications, the anti-Semitic rhetoric was ramped up in The Word of the Week posters. From 1941 to 1943 about twenty-five percent of The Word Of The Week posters included an attack on Jews. The Jews were depicted as enemies because of their supposed economic war, capitalism, and connection to the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. The Nazi regime fostered the idea that the Jews were the masterminds behind all oppositional political forces. Images often showed a Jewish figure positioned behind, or above, symbols of economic and political influence. Additionally, it was also common to depict the Allied forces of Great Britain, the United States and Russia as overtaken by Jewry. Posters were also used in schools, depicting, for instance, an institution for the feeble-minded on one hand and houses on the other, to inform the students that the annual cost of this institution would build 17 homes for healthy families. =Radio= Before Hitler came to power, he rarely used radio to connect with the public, and when he did so non-party newspapers were allowed to publish his speeches. This changed soon after he came to power in 1933. Hitler's speeches became widely broadcast all over Germany, especially on the radio, itself introduced by the Ministry of Propaganda. They were shown in weekly newsreels and reprinted in large editions in books and pamphlets all across Germany. Hitler's speeches became so significant to the Nazis that even restaurants and pubs were expected have their radios on whenever he was delivering one, and in some cities public speakers were used so passersby could hear them. Nazi propaganda emphasized and portrayed his speeches so that their main points appeared in weekly posters and were all over Germany by the hundreds of thousands. Nazi propaganda also used radio as an important tool to promote genocide. Internal broadcasts Recognising the importance of radio in disseminating the Nazi message, Goebbels approved a scheme whereby millions of cheap radio sets (the Volksempf√§nger) were subsidised by the government. In the \\"Radio as the Eighth Great Power\\" speech, Goebbels proclaimed: :It would not have been possible for us to take power or to use it in the ways we have without the radio....It is no exaggeration to say that the German revolution, at least in the form it took, would have been impossible without the airplane and the radio. ...[Radio] reached the entire nation, regardless of class, standing, or religion. That was primarily the result of the tight centralization, the strong reporting, and the up-to-date nature of the German radio....Above all it is necessary to clearly centralize all radio activities, to place spiritual tasks ahead of technical ones,...to provide a clear worldview, By the start of the Second World War, over 70% of German households had one of these radios, which were deliberately limited in range in order to prevent loyal citizens from considering other viewpoints in foreign broadcasts. Radio broadcasts were also played over loudspeakers in public places and workplaces. In private homes, however, people could easily turn off the radio when bored and did so once the novelty of hearing the voice from a box wore off; this caused the Nazis to introduce many non-propaganda elements, such as music, advice and tips, serials and other entertainment. This was accelerated during the war to prevent people from tuning in enemy propaganda broadcasts; though Goebbels claimed in his Das Reich article that it was to make the radio a good companion to the people, he admitted the truth in his diary. External broadcasts William Joyce, who was \\"Lord Haw-Haw\\" to British wartime listeners, now under arrest, lies in an ambulance under armed guard before being taken from British Second Army Headquarters to a hospital. Philippe Henriot in 1934, who later became a Vichy minister and broadcaster for the Nazis. As well as domestic broadcasts, the Nazi regime used radio to deliver its message to both occupied territories and enemy states. One of the main targets was the United Kingdom, to which William Joyce broadcast regularly, gaining the nickname 'Lord Haw-Haw'. Joyce first appeared on German radio on 6 September 1939 reading the news in English but soon became noted for his often mischievous propaganda broadcasts.Mary Kenny, Germany Calling, Dublin, 2003, p. 175 Joyce was executed in 1946 for treason. Although Joyce was the most notorious, and most regularly heard, of British propagandists, other broadcasters included Norman Baillie-Stewart, Jersey-born teacher Pearl Vardon, British Union of Fascists members Leonard Banning and Susan Hilton, Barry Payne Jones of the Link and Alexander Fraser Grant, whose show was aimed specifically at Scotland, also broadcasting through the 'New British Broadcasting Service'.Sean Murphy, Letting the Side Down: British Traitors of the Second World War, Stroud, 2006, pp. 50‚Äì102 Broadcasts were also made to the United States, notably by Robert Henry Best and 'Axis Sally' Mildred Gillars. Best, a freelance journalist based in Vienna, was initially arrested following the German declaration of war on the US but before long he became a feature on propaganda radio, attacking the influence of the Jews in the US and the leadership of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who succeeded Winston Churchill in Nazi propaganda as \\"World-Enemy Number One\\". Best was later sentenced to life imprisonment for treason. Gillars, a teacher in Germany, mostly broadcast on similar themes as well as peppering her speech with allegations of infidelity against the wives of servicemen. Her most notorious broadcast was the 'Vision of Invasion' radio play, broadcast immediately prior to D-Day, from the perspective of an American mother who dreamed that her soldier son died violently in Normandy.John Carver Edwards, Berlin Calling: American Broadcasters in Service to the Third Reich, New York, 1991 France also received broadcasts from Radio-Stuttgart, where Paul Ferdonnet, an anti- Semitic journalist, was the main voice during the Phoney War.Philippe Randa, Dictionnaire comment√© de la Collaboration fran√ßaise, 1997 Following the occupation, Radio Paris and Radio-Vichy became the main organs of propaganda, with leading far-right figures such as Jacques Doriot, Philippe Henriot and Jean H√©rold-Paquis regularly speaking in support of the Nazis. Others who broadcast included Gerald Hewitt, a British citizen who lived most of his life in Paris and had been associated with Action Fran√ßaise.Murphy, Letting the Side Down, pp. 85‚Äì87 Domestic broadcasters were also used to galvanise support for occupation in Belgium, where Ward Hermans regularly spoke in support of the Nazis from his base in Bremen,David Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, London: Heinemann, 1972, p. 155 and the Italian Social Republic, to where Giovanni Preziosi broadcast a vehemently anti-Semitic show from his base in Munich.Ray Moseley, Mussolini: The Last 600 days of Il Duce, 2004, p. 118 Pro- Nazi radio broadcasts in the Arabic language aired in North Africa, crafted with the help of Mohammad Amin al-Husayni and other Arab exiles in Berlin to highlight Arab nationalism. They recast Nazi racist ideology to target Jews alone, not all Semites. Downplaying Mussolini's operations in Africa, they touted the anti-colonialism of the Axis powers.Jeffrey Herf, Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World (Yale University Press, 2009) =Speakers= The Nazi party relied heavily on speakers to make its propaganda presentations, most heavily before they came to power, but also afterwards. Hitler, in Mein Kampf, recounted that he had realized that it was not written matter but the spoken word that brought about changes, as people would not read things that disagreed, but would linger to hear a speaker. Furthermore, speakers, having their audiences before them, could see their reactions and adjust accordingly, to persuade. His own oratory was a major factor in his rise, and he despised those who came to read pre-written speeches. Such speakers were particularly important when it was not wanted that the information put across not reach foreigners, who could access the mass media. Schools were instituted to substitute for the political conflict that had formed the old speakers. In 1939, , speaking of his own experience as an early speaker, urged that they continue. Sturmabteilung speakers were used, though their reliance on instinct sometimes offended well-educated audiences, but their blunt and folksy manner often had its own appeal. The ministry would provide such speakers with information, such as how to spin the problems on the eastern front, or how to discuss the cuts in food rations. The party propaganda headquarters, sent the Redner-Schnellinformation [Speakers' Express Information] out with guidelines for immediate campaigns, such as anti-Semitic campaigns and what information to present. Specific groups were targeted with such speakers. Speakers, for instance, were created specifically for Hitler Youth. These would, among other things, lecture Hitler Youth and the BDM on the need to produce more children. Speakers often addressed political or military rallies, which were well- orchestrated events with banners and marching bands. Prosecution Chart of Nazi propaganda shown at International Military Tribunal Historiography Nazi propaganda is a relatively recent topic of close study.Welch, 4 Historians of all persuasions, including Eastern Bloc writers, agree about its remarkable effectiveness. Their assessment of its significance, however ‚Äì whether it shaped or merely directed and exploited public opinion ‚Äì is influenced by their approach to wider questions raised by the study of Nazi Germany, such as the question of whether the Nazi state was a fully totalitarian dictatorship, as argued by Hannah Arendt, or whether it also depended on a certain societal consensus.Welch, 3‚Äì5. In addition to media archives, an important primary source for the study of the Nazi propaganda effort are the reports on civilian morale and public opinion that the Sicherheitsdienst and later the RMVP compiled from 1939 on. Another are the Deutschland-Berichte, reports gathered by underground agents of the Sopade that particularly dealt with German popular opinion.Welch, 7 See also * Themes in Nazi propaganda * Amt Rosenberg * American propaganda during World War II * Black propaganda * British propaganda during World War II * Children's propaganda in Nazi Germany * Japanese propaganda during World War II * Censorship in Germany * LTI ‚Äì Lingua Tertii Imperii * Propaganda in the Soviet Union * Propaganda of Fascist Italy * Rommel myth * Wunderwaffe * XGRS Bibliography  References Further reading External links * Advertising Evil: Pro-Nazi Posters ‚Äì slideshow by Life magazine * Calvin University.

Although records show that it has been implemented since the 1990s, CAOS is still an active research discipline which brings together orthopedic practitioners with traditionally technical disciplines, such as engineering, computer science and robotics.  Goals and Targeted Outcomes  The principal idea behind CAOS is that operative outcomes will be improved through the use of computer technology. Taking the example of joint replacement, the task of the surgeon is to integrate the new joint components into the patient's existing anatomy; CAOS technologies allow the surgeon to: * Plan the component placement in advance, including determination of the appropriate component sizes; * Measure the intra-operative placement of the components in real time, making sure that the plan is adhered to; * Measure the post-operative result  Procedural Approaches  CAOS does not substantially deviate from traditional surgical procedures, because the intended goal is to improve the overall operative outcome of the surgery. In image-based procedures, the patient still undergoes similar pre-operative screenings (consultations, scans, etc.). However, CAOS allows the surgeon to also create a \\"patient jig\\", which is a 3-D printed model of the skeletal structure of interest that aids the surgeon in the pre-operative planning stage. There are a variety of CAOS procedures depending on the system and navigation preferences. CAOS is initially divided into two categories: an active system, in which the entire procedure can be completed by a robot with little or no help necessary from the surgeon; and a passive system, in which a robot or computerized program aids the surgeon in completing the procedure. Regardless of a passive or active system, CAOS requires a mode of navigation to accurately carry out procedures. There are three methods of navigation used to carry out the surgery. * CT-Based: utilizes CT imaging to construct a 3-D* model of the patient's anatomy to guide the surgeon either: through a step-by- step walk through of the procedure; or providing real-time feedback of the operation to the surgeon. Both methods allow the surgeon to easier visualize anatomical landmarks, thus increasing both precision and accuracy of prosthetic implants. * Fluoroscopy-Based: allows the surgeon to take multiple fluoroscopic images (at different angles) of the surgical site, which provides landmarks for instrument and prosthetic placement. Fluoroscopic imaging can be either 2-D or 3-D*, and is static - it does not provide video-like feedback to the surgeon due to its nature of using still images taken during the procedure, but it significantly reduces radiation exposure to the patient. * Imageless: involves the computer constructing a digitized anatomical model of the area of interest by referencing the results of the patient's Orthopedic tests, such as joint rotation angles, flexion/extension angles, etc. Although a digital image is constructed by the computer, there are no image-taking processes in both the pre-operative and intra-operative stages thereby eliminating radiation exposure, and reducing operation time. *The 3-D images are created when the computer interacts with body parts via infrared lights and gate detectors. With CAOS, the surgeon can more accurately pinpoint anatomical landmarks that might be hard to see in a small incision. A chosen navigation system then guides the surgeon through different bone cuts and finally to implantation.  Shortcomings  Although CAOS has advantages in both the accuracy and precision of the procedure at hand, it is still not widely accepted within the orthopedic community for various reasons. One such reason is the increased medical costs to the patient. Regardless of the navigation preference, the inclusion of computer technology results in increased hospital expenditures, which are then billed to the patient. Since CAOS is still an area of active research, insurance plans are also unlikely to cover the cost of the procedures. Some studies suggest CAOS can be cost- effective for the hospital under the circumstance that a large volume of procedures are conducted on geriatric patients. Other than costs, each of the navigation methods has a shortcoming: CT-based navigation systems increase radiation exposure to the patient; fluoroscopy-based navigation increases the duration of the procedure due to the surgeon pausing to take images for an appropriate template; and imageless navigation relies heavily upon the skill of the surgeon to input accurate values derived from Orthopedic tests.  Current Development Status  There is evidence that implants and procedures undertaken with computer-assisted orthopedic surgery have significantly higher levels of accuracy and precision However, it is not conclusive that CAOS technologies result in a significant long-term improvement in operative outcome, studies suggest that CAOS may lower revision rates. Further, because of the functional adaptability of bone, errors in component placement may become unimportant in the long term. Due to the relatively short time period over which CAOS has developed, long-term follow-up studies have not yet been possible. Whilst the surgeon (or even medical students in laboratory studiesCobb, J.P. et al.: Navigation Reduces the Learning Curve in Resurfacing Total Hip Arthroplasty, page 90, Clinical Orthopaedics & Related Research (463)) can achieve better results in terms of planned vs. achieved placement of components, it is not clear whether the plan has been constructed optimally. Currently, computer-assisted orthopedic surgery is mostly used in knee implant surgery because of the precision the surgeon get with femoral and tibial bone cuts. It is also used to navigate acetabular components placement where correct cup inclination is crucial. Although CAOS is still not widely accepted by many orthopedic surgeons, it is shown to be an incredibly useful tool in facilitating the training of new surgeons due to the creation of images to help visualize anatomical landmarks for procedures. More developments are being made to reduce both costs, and radiation exposure while providing accurate guidance to the surgeon via ultrasound imaging. This navigation method is still currently being tested, and is not readily available for clinical use.

The terms of the loan will be governed by a \\"Securities Lending Agreement\\", which requires that the borrower provides the lender with collateral, in the form of cash or non-cash securities, of value equal to or greater than the loaned securities plus agreed-upon margin. Non-cash refers to the subset of collateral that is not pure cash, including equities, government bonds, convertible bonds, corporate bonds, and other financial products. The agreement is a contract enforceable under relevant law, which is often specified in the agreement. As payment for the loan, the parties negotiate a fee, quoted as an annualized percentage of the value of the loaned securities. If the agreed form of collateral is cash, then the fee may be quoted as a \\"short rebate\\", meaning that the lender will earn all the interest that accrues on the cash collateral and will \\"rebate\\" an agreed rate of interest to the borrower. Key lenders of securities include mutual funds, insurance companies, pension plans, exchange traded funds and other large investment portfolios.Lemke, Lins and Smith, Regulation of Investment Companies ¬ß8.02[1] (Matthew Bender, 2013). Securities lending is an important means of eliminating \\"failed\\" transactions as well as enabling hedge funds and other investment vehicles to sell shares short.Lemke, Lins, Hoenig and Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds, Chapter 6 (Thomson West, 2012).  History  Securities lending has been going on for over 40 years. The first formal equity lending transactions took place in the City of London in the early 1960s but it really took off as an industry in the early 1980s. The practice has evolved from a back office operation to a common investment practice that enhances returns for big financial institutions. Market size Until the start of 2009, securities lending was only an over-the-counter market, so the size of this industry was difficult to estimate accurately. According to the industry group ISLA, in the year 2007 the balance of securities on loan globally exceeded ¬£1 trillion. In July 2015, the value was $1.72 trillion (with a total of $13.22 trillion available on loan) ‚Äì similar to levels before the 2008 financial crisis. An example In an example transaction, a large institutional money manager with a position in a particular stock allows those securities to be borrowed by a financial intermediary, typically an investment bank, prime broker or other broker- dealer, acting on behalf of one or more clients. After borrowing the stock, the client - the short seller - could sell it short. Their objective is to buy the stock back at a lower price thereby creating a profit. By selling the borrowed stocks, the short seller generates cash that becomes collateral paid to the lender. The cash value of the collateral would be marked-to-market on a daily basis so that it exceeds the value of the loan by at least 2%. NB: 2% is the standard margin rate in the US, whereas 5% is more usual in Europe. Often a bank serves as the lending agent, receiving the cash collateral and investing it until it must be returned. The income from the reinvested cash collateral is divided by paying the borrower a rebate and then dividing the remaining amount between the securities lender and the agent bank. This allows major investment funds to earn incremental income on their portfolio holdings. Where the lender is a pension plan, the transaction may need to comply with various exemptions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).Lemke and Lins, ERISA for Money Managers ¬ß¬ß2:113 ‚Äì 2:114 (Thomson West, 2013). Legalities Securities lending is legal and clearly regulated in most of the world's major securities markets. Most markets mandate that the borrowing of securities be conducted only for specifically permitted purposes, which generally include: #to facilitate settlement of a trade, #to facilitate delivery of a short sale, #to finance the security, or #to facilitate a loan to another borrower who is motivated by one of these permitted purposes. When a security is loaned, the title of the security transfers to the borrower.. This means that the borrower has the advantages of holding the security, as they become the full legal and beneficial owner of it. Specifically, the borrower will receive all coupon and/or dividend payments, and any other rights such as voting rights. In most cases, these dividends or coupons must be passed back to the lender in the form of what is referred to as a \\"manufactured dividend\\". The initial driver for the securities lending business was to cover settlement failure. If one party fails to deliver stock to you it can mean that you are unable to deliver stock that you have already sold to another party. In order to avoid the costs and penalties that can arise from settlement failure, stock could be borrowed at a fee, and delivered to the second party. When your initial stock finally arrived (or was obtained from another source) lender would receive back the same number of shares in the security they lent. The principal reason for borrowing a security is to cover a short position. As you are obliged to deliver the security, you will have to borrow it. At the end of the agreement you will have to return an equivalent security to the lender. Equivalent in this context means fungible, i.e. the securities have to be completely interchangeable. Compare this with lending a ten euro note. You do not expect exactly the same note back, as any ten euro note will do. As a result of Regulation SHO, adopted by the SEC, short sellers typically must either possess the shares they are selling short or have a right to obtain them in order to cover the short sale. Securities classification and easy-to-borrow In securities lending, securities are classified by their availability to be borrowed. Highly liquid securities are considered \\"easy\\"; these products are easily found on the market should someone decide to borrow them for the purpose of selling them short. Securities that are illiquid in the market are classified as \\"hard\\". Due to various regulations, a short sale transaction in the United States and some other countries must be preceded by locating the security and quantity that one would like to be able to sell short in order to avoid naked shorting. However, the lending broker can create a list of securities that do not require such a locate. This list is referred to as an easy-to-borrow (abbreviated as ETB) list, and is also known as blanket assurances. Such a list is generated by broker-dealers based on \\"reasonable assurance\\" that the securities on the list are readily available upon customer request. However, if a security on the list cannot be delivered as promised (a \\"failure to deliver\\" would occur), the assumption of reasonable grounds no longer applies. In order to provide better grounding for such assumptions, the ETB list must be at most 24 hours old. Securities lenders Securities lenders, often simply called sec lenders, are institutions which have access to 'lendable' securities. This can be asset managers, who have many securities under management, custodian banks holding securities for third parties or third party lenders who access securities automatically via the asset holder's custodian. The international trade organization for the securities lending industry is the International Securities Lending Association. According to a June 2004 survey, their members had euro 5.99 billion worth of securities available for lending. In the US, the Risk Management Association publishes quarterly surveys among its (US based) members. In June 2005, these had USD 5.77 billion worth of securities available. Other industry associations of note include the Australian Securities Lending Association (ASLA), the Canadian Securities Lending Association (CASLA), the Pan Asia Securities Lending Association (PASLA), and the South African Securities Lending Association (SASLA). Typical borrowers include hedge funds and the proprietary trading desks of investment banks. Use of the term =In investment banking= In investment banking, the term \\"securities lending\\" is also used to describe a service offered to large investors who can allow the investment bank to lend out their shares to other people. This is often done to investors of all sizes who have pledged their shares to borrow money to buy more shares, but large investors like pension funds often choose to do this to their unpledged shares because they will receive interest income. In these types of agreements, the investor still receives any dividends as normal, the only thing they cannot generally do is to vote their shares. =In private securities-collateralized lending= The term \\"securities lending\\" is sometimes used correctly in the same context as a \\"stock loan\\" or individual \\"securities-collateralized loan\\". The former refers to the actual lending typically of banks or brokerages to other institutions to cover short sales or for other temporary purposes. The latter is used in private or institutional securities-backed loan arrangements across a wide spectrum of securities. In recent years, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has cautioned all consumers to avoid non-recourse transfer-of-title stock loans, but they enjoyed a brief popularity before the SEC and IRS came to shut almost all such providers down between 2007‚Äì2012, reclassifying non-recourse transfer-of-title title stock loans as fully taxable sales at inception (See FINRA advisory link below). Today, it is widely accepted that the only legally valid consumer lending programs involving stocks or other securities are those in which the stocks remain in the client's title and account without sale through a fully licensed and regulated institution with membership in the SIPC, FDIC, FINRA and other mainline regulatory organizations, with their own audited financial statements. These are usually in the form of securities- based credit lines. In 2011, the FINRA issued an investor alert on stock-based loan programs. In the alert, FINRA recommended investors ask several questions, including: 1) What happens to my stock once I pledge it as collateral? (FINRA states that securities should never be sold to fund the loans); 2) Does the lender have audited financials? (FINRA noted that any publicly traded major brokerage/bank that reports will need to have audited financial data available for investors); and 3) Is the institution managing the loan and accounts fully licensed and in good standing? Currently such institutional credit line programs are available only through long-standing depository relationships with institutional brokerages and their banking arms, and typically come with large depository minimums. However, there are a few securities-based credit line programs currently available in the general market that allow access at competitive rates and terms without such advance depository or client relationships. (A search for terms such as \\"wholesale stock loan\\" or \\"no title transfer stock loan\\" usually brings up a list of such providers.) Securities lending lifecycle Unlike a buy / sell trade, a securities lending transaction has a life-cycle that starts with the trade settling, and continues through until it is finally returned. During this life cycle, various life cycle events will occur: #Settlement ‚Äì Perhaps obvious, but both the initial trade and the subsequent return have to be instructed to market correctly and settlement monitored #Collateralization ‚Äì As mentioned above, the lender must receive collateral to ensure that they are adequately covered in the event of borrower default. Securities lending is very safe for lenders, since they will always receive the additional margin value above the value of the securities lent ‚Äì margins range from 2‚Äì10% usually, depending upon lender risk profile and the settlement market. The collateral process differs depending on collateral method ‚Äì main ones used are cash, cash pool, bilateral collateral and RQV through a triparty provider (such as Bank of New York, JP Morgan Chase, Euroclear or Clearstream). #Billing ‚Äì For most securities lending transactions, fees or rebates will accrue and will then be reconciled and paid on a monthly billing cycle. This ensures again that the lender is receiving their fee for the trade in a timely manner, and able to pass it along to the original beneficial owner. #Dividends ‚Äì If a security is borrowed over an announced cash dividend record date, then the borrower must 'manufacture' back the dividend to the original owner of the securities through a dividend payment. #Corporate actions ‚Äì If a security is borrowed over an announced corporate action record date ‚Äì be it mandatory or voluntary in nature ‚Äì the borrower must process the corporate action as per the instructions from the lender. #Returns ‚Äì Once the borrower no longer requires a security, they can initiate a return by calling it in to the trading desk of the lender. Securities lending vendors Historically, the securities lending market has been a very manually intensive one, with post-trade processing involving many man hours of effort. In recent years, various vendors have appeared to help provide much needed automation in the industry. The market leader in Europe for post-trade processing, Pirum, has been providing such automation services to its clients since 2000, more recently working with Eurex on automating CCP services. With pressures in the industry driving for more transparency and balance sheet optimization since the global financial crisis of 2008 many more technology vendors are creating solutions to meet the impending regulations.

The wilderness was designated by an act of Congress in 1980. Managed by the U.S. Forest Service, Black Elk Wilderness is part of Black Hills National Forest. This 13,426 acre (54 km¬≤) region is considered sacred to Native Americans, especially the Sioux and is named after Black Elk, an Oglala Sioux holy man. Mount Rushmore National Memorial is immediately to the north and much of the rest of the wilderness is bordered by other protected land under the jurisdiction of state and federal agencies. Black Elk Peak, which at 7,242 feet (2,207 m) is the tallest mountain in South Dakota, is located in the wilderness, and one can see into four different states from the summit. Craggy peaks and rocky slopes mixed with ponderosa pine, spruce and fir trees make for a varied ecosystem. Mountain goats and bighorn sheep inhabit the more rugged mountain slopes, while mule deer, whitetail deer, and elk are more common in the forested valleys. A sizeable population of hawks and falcons also inhabit the wilderness. U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season. By 2010, 80 percent of the trees in the wilderness had been killed by the Mountain pine beetle.

She was the second ship named for Captain Percival Drayton, a career naval officer who served during the American Civil War. Drayton was launched 26 March 1936 by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Miss B. E. Drayton, great-grandniece of Captain Drayton, and commissioned 1 September 1936, with Commander R. G. Pennoyer in command. Service history After her shakedown cruise to Europe from 6 October to 5 December 1936, Drayton underwent final trials and acceptance. Then sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, 6 June 1937 to join the Scouting Force at San Diego, California, 19 June. On 4 July she got underway to take part in the fruitless search for the lost aviator Amelia Earhart, participating in maneuvers at Pearl Harbor before her return to San Diego 30 July. For the next two years, Drayton exercised along the west coast, in the Hawaiian Islands, and in the Caribbean. Draytons homeport from 12 October 1939 was Pearl Harbor. With war raging in Europe and tension increasing in the pacific, Drayton joined in the constant exercises and tactical problems preparing the fleet for action. =World War II= Underway as plane guard for in TF 12 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Drayton, with the force returned to Pearl Harbor 13 December 1941 after searching for Japanese raiders. Between 24 December 1941 and 7 January 1942, she escorted a convoy to Christmas Island, making two attacks on submarines en route. Four days later she got underway in the screen of for an air strike on Bougainville on 20 February, returning to Pearl Harbor on the 24th. After screening a tanker to Suva Harbor, Fiji Islands, Drayton sailed for the United States 25 March and arrived at San Pedro, California, 5 April. She joined in training exercises and patrol duty on the west coast until 1 August 1942. USS Drayton in October 1941. Drayton sailed from Pearl Harbor 17 November 1942 for action in the Solomon Islands. She sortied from Espiritu Santo 29 November with TF 67 to intercept a Japanese naval force guarding transports en route to reinforce Guadalcanal. That night, the American ships battled a determined Japanese force off Tassafaronga. When the action was over, Drayton picked up 128 survivors, including the commanding officer from , and returned to Espiritu Santo 2 December. Drayton continued to operate in the Solomons campaign, bombarding Munda, New Georgia, and protecting transports bound for the Russell Islands. She escorted the unladen transports to Wellington, New Zealand, then returned to Noumea 7 March 1943 for exercises and patrol with TF 64. Drayton sailed from Noum√©a 13 May 1943 as escort for a transport convoy and arrived at Townsville, Australia 4 days later. Through the summer, she escorted Australian transports carrying troops from Townsville to Milne Bay for the lengthy fighting on vast New Guinea. Drayton patrolled and gave fire support during the invasion landings at Lae on 4 September and bombarded Finschhafen on 22 September. After brief overhaul at Brisbane, Australia, Drayton returned to the New Guinea area, escorting transports to Arawe, New Britain, for the landings of 15 December, and covered the marine landings near -Cape Gloucester 26 December. She screened high-speed transports from Buna Roads to the invasion of Saidor 2 January, and aside from a brief voyage to Sydney to replenish, remained on patrol and escort duty for the occupation of the Bismarck Archipelago. Drayton carried troops for the invasion of Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands. Here she joined in the bombardment 29 February 1944 and remained to provide fire support. She returned with reinforcement troops from Milne Bay 4 March and began operating as headquarters for the Landing Craft Control Officer for the Admiralties. Drayton bombarded Pityilu Island 12 March then sailed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus, escorting an LST convoy before returning to New Guinea. The destroyer got underway from Milne Bay, New Guinea, 22 March 1944 and escorted transports to Canton Island on her way to the west coast. Following an overhaul at San Francisco, California, Drayton trained out of Pearl Harbor before arriving at Eniwetok 8 August. For the next 2 months she patrolled off Maloelap, Wotje, Jaluit, and Mille‚Äîbypassed Japanese-held atolls in the Marshall Islands. USS Drayton wearing dazzle camouflage, in 1944. Drayton reported to the 7th Fleet at Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, on 20 October 1944; 5 days later, she got underway for patrol and escort duty in newly invaded Leyte Gulf, where she arrived 29 October. Her service in this operation included a voyage to New Guinea to bring back transports laden with reinforcements. On 6 December while screening a convoy of LCMs and LCIs to San Pedro Bay, Drayton was attacked by a twin-engine bomber which scored a near miss, killing two and wounding seven of the destroyer's crew. The next day she repulsed a group of strafing planes before they could damage her charges, and later the same morning engaged 10 or 12 enemy fighters. One aircraft crashed into the No. One 5 inch gun mount, killing 6 and wounding 12 men. Drayton extinguished her fires and carried out her mission, convoying her charges safely to harbor and then sailing unassisted to Manus, New Guinea for repairs. Her repairs completed, Drayton sailed from Manus 26 December 1944 for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, 9 January 1945. She gave fire support until the 13th, then sailed to San Pedro Bay to escort a support convoy to the beachhead. From 27 January to 18 February, she served on patrol and gave fire support, bombarding enemy troops in the foothills and destroying a strong point in a cave. Continuing to operate in the Philippines, Drayton participated in the landings at Mangarin Bay, Puerto Princesa, Cebu, Ormoc Bay, and Masbate City. On 23 April 1945, Drayton stood out of San Pedro Bay for the invasion of Borneo, screening the actions at Tarakan from 1 to 27 May and at Balikpapan from 1 to 21 July. Returning to Manila 29 July, she got underway 7 August, and arrived at New York 12 September. Drayton was decommissioned 9 October 1945 and sold for scrap 20 December 1946. Awards Drayton received 11 battle stars for World War II service. Legacy The USS Drayton is depicted on the insignia of the Bath, Maine Fire Department.

They were professional- level digital SLR cameras built by Eastman Kodak's Kodak Professional Imaging Solutions division. They were based on the Nikon Pronea 6i APS SLR camera and were aimed at a lower price point than other models in the Kodak DCS range.http://www.epi-centre.com/reports/9807acs.html Epi-Centre, Kodak DCS 315, John Henshall, July/August 1998 The 1.5 megapixel DCS 315 was launched in 1998, while the 3 megapixel DCS 330 was launched in 1999. The DCS 315 was the first digital SLR camera to incorporate an image preview LCD and inbuilt JPEG processing. The two cameras had different sized CCD imaging chips, both of which were smaller than either 135 film or APS-C film frames. The 315's imager had a crop factor of 2.6 relative to 135 film (\\"35mm\\"), while the 330's was larger with a factor of 1.9. The Kodak modification to the Pronea 6i involved removing the camera's film back and mounting instead a Kodak digital back. This not only covered the back of the camera, but also extended beneath it, approximately doubling the camera's height. This was required to accommodate the large PC cards used as storage media, the six AA batteries required to power the camera, and the circuitry for image processing. The Kodak back had two display screens. The upper was a full-color screen used for viewing taken shots. The lower LCD displayed the camera's settings. An infrared filter was mounted just behind the lens mount. This had to be removed in order to fit certain Nikkor lenses, including the IX-Nikkor lenses designed for the APS format camera. The DCS 315 was substantially faster than the 330 since only half as much data needed to be stored per shot. The 315 also allowed image storage in the smaller JPEG format, while the 330 only allowed Kodak's proprietary .TIF RAW format.

It is frequently cited in discussions about newly emerging forms of media in the scientific community in German-speaking countries. Riepl, the chief editor of Nuremberg's biggest newspaper at the time, stated in his dissertation about ancient modes of news communications (original title: \\"Das Nachrichtenwesen des Altertums mit besonderer R√ºcksicht auf die R√∂mer\\") that new, further developed types of media never replace the existing modes of media and their usage patterns. Instead, a convergence takes place in their field, leading to a different way and field of use for these older forms. This hypothesis is still considered to be relevant, explaining the fact that new media never make the \\"old\\" media disappear. The principle forms the basis for Niels Ole Finnemann's analyses of the 5 majors matrices of media, stating \\"the general principles in the transition from one matrix to another as follows: The emergence of a new medium is accompanied by: a) a restructuring of the whole matrix implying b) a refunctionalisation of older media c) which often results in the development of new functions, eventually utilising hitherto un-used or even unknown qualities and functions of old media, ‚Äî functions which may be as important as the new medium itself. E.g., the telegraph and innovation of print media: The telegraph allowed the transmission of news across a much wider space in a much shorter time, thereby also creating a platform for the development of a new print medium: printed newspapers. d) Finally we can also observe that new media often emerge because of information overload in older media.\\" Niels Ole Finnemann. 2001. The Internet - A new communicational Infrastructure:p. 15. Papers from The Centre for Internet Research, University of Aarhus. Support for the continued validity of Riepl's law came from the highly regarded CEO of the Alex Springer publishing group Mathias D√∂pfner who, in May 2006 wrote in a leading German newspaper Die Welt \\"I believe in Riepl's law...Books have not replaced storytelling.

It is served by Sydney Trains T3 Bankstown line services. History The original Erskineville station, situated on the north side of Erskineville Road, opened on 15 October 1884 as part of the construction of the Illawarra line to Hurstville. A new station, constructed on the south side of the overbridge, opened on 16 June 1912. The lines through Erskineville were quadruplicated on 15 June 1913 with the current arrangement of platforms. Historically, the station was served by Bankstown, East Hills and Illawarra services, however since the early 1990s it has only been served by the former.Station Information A to F State Rail Authority 1997Erskineville Station NSWrail.netErskineville Railway Station Group NSW Environment & Heritage Immediately north of Erskineville, the Eastern Suburbs line emerges from underground to join the Illawarra line. This connection opened in 1979. Only the two western platforms are used, although the eastern pair are used by Eastern Suburbs and Illawarra line services when the Bankstown line is closed for engineering work. To the west of the station, lie two incomplete platforms. They were originally built in the 1970s as part of the construction of the Eastern Suburbs line when the alignment between Sydenham and Erskineville was expanded to accommodate six tracks. This was abandoned as a cost-cutting exercise. The CityRail Clearways Project envisaged reviving this plan, with stopping trains serving only the newly completed western platforms. However, this project was cancelled in November 2008.Mini-Budget 2008/09 page 25 New South Wales Treasury November 2008 Future As part of the Sydney Metro project, in 2024 the Bankstown line will be converted to a rapid transit line with a new underground line north of Sydenham that will bypass Erskineville.

Along with Anderson, they decided to form their own band, originally called the Baby Machines.Thompson, Dave (2000) Alternative Rock, Miller Freeman, , p. 478-9 Bassist Steve Rippon joined and they changed their name to Lush. When Barham left, \\"the remaining members of Lush placed ads in local papers looking for Barham's replacement, but they couldn't find the singer they wanted and Berenyi took over the vocals\\". From 1987 until 1996, she played with Lush, releasing several albums, singles and music videos and toured extensively through the UK, North America, Japan, Australia and other countries. She and Acland also collaborated with members of Cocteau Twins and Moose, releasing one song in 1991 under the name Lillies.Miki Berenyi of Lush in the Von Pip Musical Express Interview, contains a link to the title Lush officially announced their breakup in February 1998, following Acland's suicide in October 1996. After Lush split, Berenyi appeared on the Rentals' album Seven More Minutes (1999). She also contributed vocals to a remix of a Flat 7 track by Robin Guthrie (who also produced Lush's early work) and appeared on Seinking Ships' debut album, Museum Quality Capture, released in 2010. When asked if she missed anything about her time in Lush, Berenyi stated, \\"I miss the excitement and energy of playing live and the camaraderie of touring‚Äîbeing with the band and crew in a foreign country is like going on holiday with your mates but even more fun because it‚Äôs free.\\" She also said, \\"I enjoyed being in the band immensely, I‚Äôm glad I did it\\". Berenyi later worked for a magazine as a sub-editor and did not perform for many years. She explained: \\"I was never a proper guitarist‚Äîonly in the context of Lush. I played the guitar to write songs on and to play live\\". Lush, including Berenyi, announced a reunion on 28 September 2015. They toured extensively throughout 2016 and released an EP of new material; \\"Blind Spot\\" in April of that year. Bassist Phil King left the band in October 2016 and as a consequence Lush played their final farewell gig, with Michael Conroy of Modern English on bass at Manchester Academy on 25 November 2016. In September 2018, Berenyi announced that she had formed a new band, Piroshka, with Welch, Conroy and former Moose member K.J. \\"Moose\\" McKillop. Berenyi and partner McKillop have two children.Aston, Martin (2013). Facing the Wrong Way: The Story of 4AD. The Friday Project. Their debut album, Brickbat, was released by Bella Union on 15 February 2019.  Influences  In 2020, Berenyi cited The Shangri-Las as an influence for their harmonies and lyrics.

Several related materials are known, including four polymorphs of FePO4 and two polymorphs of the dihydrate FePO4¬∑(H2O)2. These materials find several technical applications as well as occurring in the mineral kingdom.Roncal-Herrero, T., Rodriguez-Blanco, J.D., Benning, L.G., Oelkers, E.H.

Structure  The most common form of FePO4 adopts the structure of Œ±-quartz. As such the P and Fe have tetrahedral molecular geometry. At high pressures, a phase change occurs to a more dense structure with octahedral Fe centres. Two orthorhombic structures and a monoclinic phase are also known. In the two polymorphs of the dihydrate, the Fe centre is octahedral with two mutually cis water ligands.  Uses  Iron(III) phosphate can be used in steel and metal manufacturing processes. When bonded to a metal surface, iron phosphate prevents further oxidation of the metal. Its presence is partially responsible for the corrosion resistance of the Iron pillar of Delhi. Iron phosphate coatings are commonly used in preparation for painting or powder coating, in order to increase adhesion to the iron or steel substrate, and prevent corrosion, which can cause premature failure of subsequent coating processes. It can also be used for bonding fabrics, wood, and other materials to iron or steel surfaces. Anhydrous iron phosphate has been investigated as an intercalation electrode in a lithium-ion battery despite having low electronic conductivity. =Pesticide= Iron phosphate is one of the few molluscicides approved for use in the practice of organic farming. Pesticide pellets containing iron phosphate plus a chelating agent, such as EDTA, leach heavy metals from soil into groundwater. The Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) reported the EDTA content and stated products were likely to be no safer than metaldehyde baits. Ferric phosphate slug and snail baits marketed in the U.S. contain EDTA. Legislation Iron(III) phosphate is not allowed as food additive in the European Union. It was withdrawn from the list of allowed substances in the directive 2002/46/EC in 2007.

It is served by Sydney Trains T2 Inner West & Leppington line services. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Former Petersham station building Petersham Station was opened on 6 January 1857 as a halt. A goods yard was established in 1882 and soon afterwards plans were prepared to quadruplicate the main line from Sydney to Homebush. This resulted in a further reorganisation of the Petersham yard so that the main station building was sited \\"up\\" on the platform and a new iron footbridge was built to cross the new railway and connect up with a new island platform where the earlier building was demolished and replaced by an elegantly designed curved roof structure. The new station building and footbridge were all designed by George Cowdery who was also responsible for the design of several other large and elaborate station buildings, including Newcastle (1876), Werris Creek (1883) and Cootamundra (1887). The plan of the station was based on the standard developed by John Whitton but the design and detailing of the station buildings and footbridge were much more elaborate than most station designs used elsewhere. In 1891, the present subway was built and another island platform building constructed to serve the slow tracks. Access to the platforms from this subway closed after 1988.Stations & Tracks Volume 1 Main Suburban State Rail Authority 1988 A turn-back siding previously located between the local tracks has now been removed.\\"Reading the Railway Landscape\\" Australian Railway History May 2010 Volume 61 no 871 This turn back siding was located on land now used for the training college west of the station. The Main Suburban line through Petersham was quadruplicated in 1892.\\"NSW Railway Passenger Services 1880-1905\\" Australian Railway History Vol 56 No 810 April 2005 page 141 A pedestrian subway was provided in 1892 at the western end of the station, connecting Trafalgar and Terminus Streets. Access to the platforms from this subway closed after 1988. Additional land was purchased in 1911 for a large goods yard and, with a new goods shed built in 1913, made Petersham a major suburban station serving passengers and freight. In 1926, the addition of a further two tracks and electrification as part of a second stage of sextuplication and electrification of the Main Suburban line resulted in a major change to the way the station operated. The 1885 station building was closed and eventually became the offices of the District Signal Engineer. The other platform buildings were demolished and replaced by a brick building. The goods yard was gradually phased out and closed shortly after the second world war. In 1954 the north wing of the 1885 building was taken over by the Railways and Tramways Hospital Fund, and the present eastern wing was added. Upgrades to the station took place in the late 1990s, with the wooden steps on the footbridge being replaced due to their slipperiness in wet weather, a small but high-roofed shed at the east end of the platform being removed for security reasons, and the area under the lower part of the platform stairs also being fenced-off for similar concerns. As of October 2020, the station is undergoing substantial upgrades, including two lifts providing ambulant access to the platform, new access ramps, lighting and CCTV upgrades, as well as improved access infrastructure such as bicycle parking and an accessible parking space. Training college In 1967, the Department of Railways granted the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum use of the former goods sidings pending its moving to Enfield.\\"The New South Wales Rail Transport Museum: The First Thirty Years\\" Roundhouse January 1994 page 5 On 6 November 1987, this site was opened by the State Rail Authority as a training college, being officially opened by Minister for Transport Ron Mulock.\\"Staff Training College\\" Railway Digest February 1988 page 48 It was refurbished in 2008 with the two Tulloch trailers replaced with S set carriages Petersham Rail Leighton Contractors As well as various pieces of rail signalling and track infrastructure, the training college has two S set carriages.

Petersham Railway Station is entered from Trafalgar Street to the south and Terminus Street to the north. The station group has a former wayside platform and station building (currently offices) and island platform accessed via the footbridge. The former station building is generally accessed from Terminus Street. To the north of the station on Terminus Street is a residential area while to the south and across Trafalgar Street by industrial and commercial buildings. ;Former station building (1885 with 1954 alterations) The \\"first class station building\\" is a symmetrical composition in an ornate Italianate style with a high parapeted central block, a central tower, and flanked by lower supporting buildings. The main block is fronted to the south by a platform awning supported by cast iron columns with decorative cast iron lace work. The width of this platform has been reduced since it was decommissioned. The Terminus Street elevation is accessed via sandstone steps onto a veranda, supported on cast iron columns with decorative lacework, which spans the extent of the central block. An access door under this veranda has been created off the lower landing of the stone steps to the west. The exterior walls are face brickwork with painted moulded cement decorative elements. To the eastern end of the original building is a rendered brick extension. Infill sections have been constructed between the previously separate wings to the east and west and 2 garage doors under the eastern wing (there was previously a garage door located further to the east which has subsequently been bricked up). Recent restorations have included new tuck pointing and the reinstatement of most of the doors and windows to the south elevation, although several remain non operational. The works also saw the roof replaced in corrugated steel sheeting in place of the original slate. The oval vents to the roof were reinstated. These works have been undertaken in an appropriate and sensitive manner obviously with reference to the original architectural drawings. There have been several changes to the existing building internally, mostly as a result of changing function. There are several new openings in the partition walls, and these have been treated so as to complement the original style of the building. The doors and windows to the north elevation are for the most part, original, with the reproduced doors and windows to the south elevation to match. All mouldings such as skirtings, architrave and cornices are in keeping with the age of the building. From the garage and subfloor space it would appear that much of the timber floor structure has been replaced. These floors are carpeted above. Many of the later partition walls and fittings have been worked around the existing fabric and would for the most part be considered \\"reversible\\". There is Perspex secondary glazing to the openings on the south side in an attempt to keep out the noise of the passing trains. The former station building was in good condition at the time of heritage listing. The exterior of this building is largely intact and has been subject to extensive restoration in recent years. The offices which occupy the 1954 extension and a small section of the original 1885 building are not considered significant. While this extension to the west has little merit, it does not detract from the integrity of the main building. Likewise, infill sections are poorly executed but do not have a major impact on the integrity of the 1885 building. The interior contains many architectural features, both original and reproductions, which contribute to the significance and integrity of the building as a whole. ;Platform Building (1926) A rectangular face brick building (all painted) with a gabled roof and integral shallower sloped cantilevered awnings. The face brick in stretcher bond has been painted. The building is seven bays in length, with the bays defined by engaged brick piers which coincide with the awning supports. Original chimneys have been removed. The cantilever awning is on standard double bowed steel brackets supported on decorative cement cornices on engaged brick piers and bolt fixings to the station building brick walls. The soffit is the underside of the corrugated steel roof fixed to intermediate exposed purlins. There is a decorative timber fascia at the junction with the brick wall. Vertical timber boards form a valance at each end. The edge of the awning is finished with a plain timber fascia. The awning roof, as for the main roof, is corrugated steel. The window openings have brick sills and arched brick heads with original timber sashes. Security grilles have been fitted to all doors and windows and modern services fixed to the building. The canopy to the eastern end is completely modern ( 1990s). The planter box to the western end is thought to be where the stairs once accessed the subway. The interior is much altered from original plans dated 1925. The booking office and associated functions were relocated to be housed in this building when the subway was closed. Some original features remain including the mini corrugated metal ceilings and pressed metal ceiling roses, moulded bead detail to rendered and set walls, cornices and architraves. Windows are original sashes however the doors are replacements. The floor is covered in vinyl and may have original timber floorboards under. The existing waiting room, which is currently used as a store has the original bench seating. The toilets have been relocated from the original plans to the western end of the building and these rooms now have little merit. The platform building was in good condition at the time of heritage listing. While the exterior is mainly intact, the interior has been modified to meet ever- changing operational requirements. This, coupled with the fact that there a more intact examples of this type of platform building elsewhere, has reduced the integrity of this particular building. ;Signal box (1927) External: A timber framed structure with fibre cement cladding on brick base. Access is on the eastern side, via precast concrete stairs, onto cantilevered concrete platform. The small external toilet is accessed off the concrete platform to the south. To the north-east and north-west corners there are timber framed multi paned sliding casement windows with security grilles to the exterior. The building features a Dutch gable roof with fibre cement slates and decorative finials with a timber louvred vent to the gablets. Internally, it has typical ceiling detail with a raked section to perimeter and cover mouldings. The metal bracing across the ceiling is also typical in signal boxes of this period. The interior walls have fibre cement sheet and batten cladding. The original signalling equipment still remains. The signal box is mostly intact with all its signalling equipment, original fibre cement slate tiles and weatherboard walls. It was reported to require maintenance attention at the time of heritage listing. ;Platforms Platform 1 (Up) and Platform 2 (Down) form an island platform with asphalt surface and original brick facing. The platform to the former station (to the north) has been made narrower and is not currently used. ;Canopies There is a modern canopy at the edge of the stairs that leads down from the footbridge onto the platform and it provides shelter to the space between the stairs and the platform building. The canopy has a slight butterfly roof and is constructed of Colorbond steel sheets resting on steel I beams and columns. ;Footbridge (1883) The footbridge comprises a deck connecting both Trafalgar and Terminus Streets and stairs that lead down to the platform and the streets. The entire structure rests on original brick piers, cast iron columns, arches and steel trestles. Refurbished in 1992 the footbridge has a concrete deck and stairs with painted steel handrails and balustrades. The riveted metal lattice work to the underneath of the deck of the footbridge is original. ;Pedestrian Subway (1891) The subway runs from north to south under the rail tracks and accommodates the two entries into the station. It has brick walls and a ceiling made of original concrete slabs reinforced with steel joists. However, as the walls are almost entirely covered in graffiti it is difficult to ascertain original fabric. The subway originally had a booking office and stairs leading up to the platforms. However at some point both were bricked in and this has resulted in the subway having no connections with the platforms and serving as only a crossing under the tracks. ;Retaining walls There are brick retaining walls along Terminus Street made of English bond brickwork from the platform to former station building with an opening for stairs to footbridge. The wall continues up Terminus Street to the east for approximately 100 metres. ;Moveable items of heritage significance * Safe in Station Manager's Office * Honours Board in Station Manager's Office * Photographs in Station Manager's Office & Terminus Street Building * NSWGR Sink in garage of Terminus Street Building ;Integrity Despite the moderate integrity of the island platform buildings and the limited integrity of the subway, overall the Petersham Station Group is assessed as having a high level of integrity based on the condition and intactness of the Terminus Street former station building, the footbridge and the signal box.  Heritage listing  Petersham Railway Station has State significance as the station with its group of largely intact, original structures dating from the 1880s establishment of the station through to the 1891 quadruplication and the 1927 sextuplication of the line, is able to demonstrate the growth and expansion of the railways in the late 19th and early 20th century. The building serves to mark the alignment of the first railway in NSW, that being the 1855 Sydney to Parramatta line; The 1880s former station building is the largest and most elaborate 19th century station building constructed for the Sydney suburban rail system and is the only major \\"First Class\\" station building known to have been built in Sydney in the 19th century and is therefore unique in the history of the New South Wales Government Railways. It is a fine example of a late Victorian Italianate station dating from 1885, and although compromised by later alterations and additions is substantially intact and capable of restoration. The building is unusual and of significance by being reached from the street by a grand stair in the classical manner and having a landscaped forecourt to a suburban street and forms a major part of an important historic railway precinct including the bridge and signal box and is a significant landmark in this part of Petersham, which retains much of its 19th century built street character. The station is one of a select number of similar buildings designed by the office of the Engineer for the Existing Lines Branch, George Cowdery, with the 1883 iron pedestrian bridge and steps also designed by Cowdery; Petersham railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Petersham Railway Station has State significance as the station with its group of largely intact, original structures dating from the 1880s establishment of the station through to the 1891 quadruplication and the 1927 sextuplication of the line, is able to demonstrate the growth and expansion of the railways in the late 19th and early 20th century. The extant 19th and 20th century platforms, buildings, footbridge, subway and signal box are collectively able to demonstrate important historical phases of suburban railway development. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Petersham Railway Station is significant for its association with Engineer-in- Chief George Cowdery under whose direction the extant 1880s former station building and footbridge were designed, the design and detailing of the station building and footbridge being more elaborate than most station design used elsewhere. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Petersham Railway Station has State aesthetic significance with its 1880s \\"first class station building\\" which displays complicated roof forms, large symmetrical plan and awnings supported on cast iron columns. The building has a prominent presence to both Terminus Street and as viewed from the island platform and footbridge. The 1920s \\"initial island\\" platform building is significant with its design showing linear form, gable roof and integrated awnings. The 1880s footbridge with stairs leading down the platforms and streets has been altered considerably in terms of the recasting of the stairs and deck and installation of new handrails and balustrades. However the footbridge has a number of 1880s elements namely brick piers, cast iron columns, arches, steel trestles and latticework to the deck and overall retains is aesthetic quality. The signal box which dates from 1927 has technical significance as it contains all its signalling equipment demonstrating signalling technology of this era. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Petersham Railway Station has rarity in terms of its \\"first class station building\\" and the footbridge, with the station building being the only 'first class station building' in the Sydney area and the footbridge being the second oldest surviving footbridge in NSW and a unique example within the suburban network. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The building on platform 1/2 has been altered internally but it retains a high level of integrity to its exterior and is representative of a common form of standard platform building design. With seven bays the building is one of the larger examples of its type and is therefore an excellent representation of this type. The signal box at Petersham Railway Station has characteristic features of this type of signal box namely its elevated brickwork base, timber framed, fibre cement clad operating level structure and Dutch gable roof and has a high level of integrity as its original signalling equipment has been retained and it still has original fibre cement slate roof tiles, making it an excellent example.

It is served by Sydney Trains T2 Inner West & Leppington line services. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Stanmore Station was opened in 1878 with a signal box erected in 1881. The present station buildings were built in 1885, and the station reopened on 17 January 1886. The existing island platform building originally fronted Douglas Street on the north side and was built to a similar design to the disused station building at Petersham. In 1885 the original pedestrian subway was built, and a new signal box (relocated from Petersham) replaced the existing signal box. The Main Suburban line through Stanmore was quadruplicated in 1891, at which time its platform became an island platform and an awning was added to the original street facade. The platforms were also extended to 156 m and an additional platform built on the northern side of the new Up Suburban track. The station reflects the changes that came with track amplification, its original northern street frontage converted skilfully to an island by Cowdery, its relocated and extended subway and its parcels office on the new north frontage. Further changes to the station included new barriers and a booking office in 1897; a ladies toilet on the Down Local platform in 1900; the island platforms extended in 1905; the signal box closed and Down platform extended in 1913; and stairways covered in 1923. The main line was sextuplicated in 1927 in association with electrification works; with these changes, a new pedestrian subway was built in 1926 and the Up Suburban platform demolished.\\"Sydney Electric Trains from 1926-1960\\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin April 2001 page 128 In 1960 the Up booking office was relocated to Platforms 1 and 2 and the parcels office located in the former booking office. Up until the 1980s, a few morning peak services from the North Shore line called at platform 1 for the benefit of Newington College students. Platforms and services Transport links Transit Systems operates one route via Stanmore station: *412: Martin Place to Campsie station Stanmore station is served by one NightRide route: *N50: Liverpool to City (Town Hall)  Description  Stanmore Railway Station is entered from Trafalgar Street to the south and Douglas Street to the north via the pedestrian subway. The buildings are located at an important road intersection, with shopping precincts to both the north and south. The station group comprises a wayside platform with building, island platform with building, pedestrian subway, and parcel's office to the north. The current Inner West line uses the two southernmost tracks of the six tracks passing through the station. The station complex include the Platform 1/2 and Platform 3 station buildings (both 1886), the former parcels and booking office (1913) and the pedestrian subway (1926). Platform 1/2 dates from 1880s, extended in 1891, while Platform 3 dates from 1880s. The integrity of Stanmore Railway Station as a whole is considered to be high based on the fact that the platform buildings, the subway, and the parcels office are rarely seen so intact on the one site. ;Platform building - Platform 1/2 The \\"second class station\\" building is flanked by attached wing structures with a combination of hipped and gable roof forms. The awnings are integrated with the hipped roof to the east and west wings, and extend from below the line of the eaves to the central section of the roof. The roofing material for both the awning and the roof is corrugated steel which has replaced the original corrugated galvanised iron roofing. There are transverse gables, which face north and south, and feature decorative barge boards, finials and ridges. The hipped roofs to east and west have original chimneys and ventilated lanterns. The brickwork is painted and features a decorative dentilled course to the eastern and western ends. There are brick pilasters, with moulded rendered capitals, to the central section on the south side and in one instance the capital has been modified to accommodate a down pipe. The window openings to the western end of the building have been amended to suit the toilet facilities this section of the building now accommodates. Where this section of the building joins the waiting room there is cracking at the junction of the brickwork externally. Air-conditioning units and modern services and conduits have been fixed to the brickwork and in front of windows on the northern elevation of this building. The awning structure consists of timber beams with stop chamfers, and purlins with beaded edge detail, supported by original cast iron columns (which have NSWGR insignia) with new corrugated metal roof sheeting. The Station Manager's office and the booking office (at the eastern end of the building) have some original extant fabric, including pressed metal ceilings and cornices, ceiling rose, original windows and architraves (with modern security grilles). New partition walls have been constructed to create a toilet and CCTV equipment room. The store room adjacent to the Station Manager's office has (possibly original) floorboards and timber ceiling lining. The main waiting room has timber lining boards to the ceiling with a beaded profile and original mouldings. The timber floors and fixed bench seating remain and are in good condition. There is a pair of double leaf panelled doors and original windows, with timber architrave and sill boards, all in sound condition. The timber floors and fixed bench seating are also in good condition. There is a chimney breast and hearth to the western end of the room, with the opening bricked up. The waiting room, adjacent to the ladies toilet, has an original ceiling rose, door, windows and architraves and has a dado rail and skirting which is in keeping with the age of the building. There is a chimney breast and hearth to the eastern end of the room, with the opening bricked up. The building was reported to be in good condition at the time of heritage listing, although a few surface cracks had developed in the brickwork. The building is largely intact externally although its interiors have been modified to meet ever- changing operational requirements. It retains a number of original external features namely the chimneys, ventilated lanterns, and decorative dentilled course to the brickwork and original cast iron columns with NSWGR insignia. Some of the original elements retained to the interior include pressed metal ceilings, cornices, ceiling rose, original windows, architraves, floorboards, timber ceiling lining, fixed bench seating, a pair of double leaf panelled doors and original but bricked up chimney breasts. Modern services such as air-conditioning, lighting and CCTV have been installed yet they do not detract from the integrity of the buildings overall. ;Platform Building - Platform 3 The \\"second class station\\" is a brick building with a central open waiting room and enclosed rooms to either end (painted to all but Trafalgar Rd elevation). The building has a hipped roof form with original chimneys to either end. The awning extends from below the line of the eaves and the roofing material for both the awning and the roof is corrugated steel, which has replaced the original corrugated galvanised iron roofing. The awning is to the same detail as the one on Platform 1‚Äì2, supported by original cast iron columns, new corrugated metal roof sheeting, modern services and conduits are fixed to original elements. The brick wall to Trafalgar Road has been extended to both the east, to full height adjacent to the former ticket window, and to the west to provide toilet facilities. The toilet addition (c.1900) to the far west of the building is accessed through an opening in an original external wall. The former booking office (now storage) to the eastern end of the building has some original features including ceiling rose, original windows and architraves (the ticket window has been painted out to inside). There is a chimney breast but no fireplace opening. The waiting area to the central section has timber lining boards to the ceiling, with a beaded profile and a scotia moulding. The original timber floors and fixed bench seating are in good condition. The storage to the western end has some original features including ceiling rose, original windows and mouldings including dado rail, skirtings, architraves and sill boards and chimney breast but no fireplace opening. The building was reported to be in moderate condition at the time of heritage listing. The building is largely intact externally although its interiors have been modified to meet ever-changing operational requirements. It retains a number of original external features namely the chimneys and original cast iron columns with NSWGR insignia. Some of the original elements retained to the interior include a ceiling rose, original windows, architraves, floorboards, timber ceiling lining, fixed bench seating and an original but bricked up chimney breast. Modern services such as air- conditioning, lighting and CCTV have been installed yet they do not detract from the integrity of the buildings overall. ;Former parcels and booking office The Federation period brick building consists of two rooms which are currently used as storage. The external brickwork is in good condition, with new vents installed at low level. The original windows remain with the original coloured glazing (obscured to the exterior by security grilles). There is some damage to gutter fascia to the north-west corner. Externally, modern services and conduits have been fixed to the original fabric. There is a fibre cement slate half-gabled roof in a diamond pattern to north, east and west roof face with dormer details, with corrugated metal roofing to the south. The rainwater fixtures have been replaced. The original door, windows and architraves remain with dado rail, skirting and wall vents which are in keeping with the age of the building. There is mini-corrugated metal sheeting to ceiling. Modern lighting, services and conduits have been face fixed to walls and ceilings. The timber glazed partition seems to be a later addition. Generally the building is in good condition with original fabric both internally and externally. Unsympathetic repairs, to the roof in particular, graffiti and adhesive marks on the brickwork do somewhat reduce the integrity of this buildingbut can be remedied. ;Platforms Platform 1 and Platform 2 (Up) form an island platform. Platform 1 is not currently in use except by trains during track work or in emergencies. Platform 3 (Down) is a wayside platform. All the platforms have asphalt surfaces and original brick faces. ;Pedestrian Subway The subway is face brick, with recessed detail to stairs, and a painted render finish to subway. There are areas of replacement brickwork and repairs to pointing are visible. The covered stair to Platform 1-2 is a painted timber framed structure with lining boards over rafters, which is in good condition. There are security grilles covering the openings to the outside. The timber elements are all fairly plain except at the entrance to the platform where there are stop chamfered posts and mouldings to rafters. There is modern lighting and service conduits and pipes face fixed to the walls. The concrete stairs are relatively new. The subway has been changed but it also retains original fabric namely the brick walls, the steel girder and concrete ceiling. ;Historically significant moveable items * Safe in Station Manager's Office * Desk/Shelving Unit in Station Manager's Office * Bench seating to waiting Rooms = Modifications and dates = * 1881: Block signal box erected. * 1885: New signal box from Petersham re-erected; original pedestrian subway built. * 1891: Platforms extended to 156 m and an additional platform built on the northern side of the new Up Suburban track. * 1897: Barriers and booking office provided. * 1900: Ladies toilet on Down Local platform. * 1905: Island platforms extended. * 1913: Signal box closed; Down platform extended. * 1923: Stairways covered. * 1926: New pedestrian subway built in association with widening to six tracks; Up Suburban platform demolished due to track amplification. * 1928: Local and Suburban lines electrified to Homebush. * 1944-46 Modifications to former booking/parcel office (subject to confirmation) * 1955: Main lines electrified to Homebush. * 1960: Up booking office relocated to Platforms 1 and 2; parcels office located in former booking office.  Heritage listing  Stanmore Railway Station has State significance for its group of largely intact, original structures dating from the 1880s establishment of the station through to the 1891 quadruplication and the 1927 sextuplication of the line, which are able to demonstrate the growth and expansion of the railways in the late 19th and early 20th century. It is significant for its collection of railway structures namely the 1880s platform buildings, the 1910s former parcels and booking office and the 1920s subway which have remained largely intact and form a cohesive group which is able to effectively represent suburban railway stations of the late 19th century. The extant 1880s platform buildings are excellent examples of \\"second class station\\" buildings which have a high level of integrity. The group remains relatively intact and is a significant landmark in the local area. Stanmore railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Stanmore Railway Station has State significance as the station with its group of largely intact, original structures dating from the 1880s establishment of the station through to the 1891 quadruplication and the 1927 sextuplication of the line, is able to demonstrate the growth and expansion of the railways in the late 19th and early 20th century. The 1880s platform buildings, the 1910s former parcels and booking office and the 1920s subway collectively represent key historic phases of suburban railway development. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Stanmore Railway Station is significant for its association with Engineer-in-Chief George Cowdery who was influential in guiding the changes made to the station as part of the 1891 quadruplication of the line namely the conversion of the existing island Platform 1-2 and the construction of the former parcels and booking office along Douglas Street. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Collectively the complex of station structures at Stanmore Railway Station have local aesthetic significance. The 1880s \\"second class station buildings\\" displays large central brick buildings flanked by attached wing structures, hipped roofs with a transverse gable and awnings supported by original cast iron columns with decorative brackets. The former parcels and booking office is an example of the Federation style architecture prevalent in late 19th and early 20th century suburban railway stations. Together the platform buildings along Trafalgar Street and the subway and former parcels and booking office along Douglas Street form significant landmarks in the local area. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The platform buildings at Stanmore Railway Station are largely intact externally and retain a large amount of original fabric externally and internally and are therefore amongst the best examples of this type of platform building. The subway has been changed but it retains characteristic features of a subway namely connecting the street to the platforms and has some original fabric and is therefore a good representation.

The signatories bound themselves to keep secret the contents of the treaty until a general peace was concluded.  Negotiations  In 1915 Lieutenant-Colonel Christopher Thomson, a fluent French speaker, was sent to Bucharest as British military attach√© on Kitchener's initiative to bring Romania into the war. But when there he quickly formed the view that an unprepared and ill-armed Romania facing a war on three fronts against Austria- Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria would be a liability not an asset to the allies. This view was brushed aside by Whitehall and he signed (with foreboding) a Military Convention with Romania on 13 August 1916.Masefield, Sir Peter G: To Ride the Storm: The Story of the Airship R.101, pp. 16‚Äì17 (1982, William Kimber, London) Thompson became head of the British Military Mission. Terms Proposed demarcation line with Hungary. Note that the 1916 treaty did not give Bessarabia to Romania. Ethno-linguistic map of Austria-Hungary, 1910 (for comparison) The treaty had two parts: a political treaty (seven articles) and a military convention (seventeen articles). The Romanian government was to declare war on Austria-Hungary, in accordance with the stipulations in the military convention, on August 28 (new style) the latest, according to the political treaty. In exchange, it was to receive the following territories: * Transylvania, Cri»ôana and Maramure»ô, territories ruled by Hungary, but with an ethnic Romanian majority and Hungarian and German minorities, with its western border reaching the Tisza river.The lights that failed: European international history, 1919‚Äì1933; Zara Z. Steiner, 2005, p.94 * The whole Banat territory The Routledge companion to Central and Eastern Europe since 1919, Adrian Webb, 2008, p.7 ruled by Hungary, with a mixed Romanian (37.42 %), German (24.50 %), Serbian (17.97 %) and Hungarian (15.31 %) population. * Most of Bukovina (the whole region except the part north of the Pruth river), the territory ruled by Austria, with a Romanian majority population. The exact borders stipulated by the treaty were those of prewar Romania (Article I) and those it was allowed to annex from Austria- Hungary, up to a line of demarcation described in Article IV: In Article IV Romania also bound itself not to construct fortifications opposite Belgrade and to indemnify Serbs from Banat for their properties if they emigrated from Romania in the two years following the conclusion of peace. In Article V of the political convention, the signatories promised not to make separate peace and also bound Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia to let Romania annex the territories from Article IV at an eventual Peace Treaty. The Entente also guaranteed Romania equal rights with its allies at the Peace Conference in Article VI of the political treaty. Article VII bound the signatories to maintaining secrecy of the convention until a general peace was signed. The military convention stated that Romania was to attack Austria-Hungary from the south while Russia committed itself to start an offensive on the Austrian front to support the Romanian advance into Transylvania. Also, the Russian High Command promised to send two infantry divisions and one cavalry division into Dobruja to protect the rear of the front from a Bulgarian attack.Kiri»õescu, p. 180 The French and the British pledged to start an offensive on the Thessaloniki front in order to force Bulgaria out of the war. Romania in the war In the morning of 27 August 1916 (14 August O.S.), a Crown Council was held at the Cotroceni Palace, convened by King Ferdinand, which decided to honor the treaty with the Entente Powers. On that day, Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary, and launched three armies of 440,000 men the same night across the passes of the Southern and Eastern Carpathians. The advance of the Romanian Army was initially unopposed, as Austria-Hungary had not stationed considerable forces along the Romanian border. By mid- September, however, the attack was halted, with German, Bulgarian and Turkish troops advancing into Dobruja and threatening to outflank the Romanian Army from the south-east. By October, the Romanian Army was pushed out of Transylvania with the help of German reinforcements, and by the end of 1916 the capital Bucharest had fallen, along with Wallachia and Dobruja, under the control of the Central Powers, while the Romanian government retreated to Ia»ôi. Thompson, now head of the British Military Mission, had to alleviate the consequences of Romania's capitulation, and he personally supervised the destruction of the Romanian oil wells to deny them to Germany.Masefield, pp. 16‚Äì17 (1982, William Kimber, London) In 1917, the Romanian Army recovered and succeeded in stopping German attempts to break the front, in spite of the disintegration of the Russian Army after the February Revolution. The exit of Russia from the war in March 1918 with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk left Romania alone in Eastern Europe, and a peace treaty between Romania and the Central Powers (Treaty of Bucharest (1918)) was negotiated in May 1918. The toll of the campaign was approximately 220,000 dead for Romania, but in the end it gained Transylvania, two-thirds of the Banat, Bukovina, and Bessarabia.

Romero's Knightriders, is a 1981 American drama film written and directed by George A. Romero and starring Ed Harris, Gary Lahti, Tom Savini, Amy Ingersoll, Patricia Tallman, and Christine Forrest. It was filmed entirely on location in the Pittsburgh metro area, including Fawn Township and Natrona during the summer of 1980. The film represents a change of pace for Romero, known primarily for his horror films; it is a personal drama about a travelling renaissance fair troupe. Plot Billy leads a traveling troupe that jousts on motorcycles. \\"King William\\", as he styles himself, tries to lead the troupe according to his Arthurian ideals. However, the constant pressure of balancing those ideals against the modern day realities and financial pressures of running the organization are beginning to strain the group. Billy is also plagued by a recurring dream of a black bird. Tensions are exacerbated by Billy's constantly pushing himself despite being injured and the arrival of a promoter named Bontempi, who wants to represent the troupe. After Billy spends a night in jail watching a member of his troupe beaten because Billy has refused a payoff to a corrupt local cop, Billy returns to the fairground where the troupe is next to perform and is shocked that some members want to join with the promoter. His sense of betrayal is heightened when his queen, Linet, admits that her feelings for him may not be the reason she remains with the troupe. Things come to a head after Morgan, leader of the dissident faction who believes he should be king, wins the day's tournament and a fight breaks out between the troupe and rowdy members of the crowd. Billy faces an Indian rider with a black eagle crest on his breast plate, the black bird of his dreams. Billy defeats the Indian but aggravates his injury; later commissioning the Indian as a knight in his troupe. Morgan and several other riders leave the troupe to follow Bontempi. Billy's loyal supporter Alan also departs with his new girlfriend Julie and friend Bors to try to sort out his emotions. Billy and the remainder of the troupe settle at the fairground to await the dissidents' return. Troupe member Pippin comes to terms with his homosexuality and finds love with Punch. Alan's girlfriend, Julie, has run away from home to escape her alcoholic and abusive father and her weak-willed mother. While Alan is soul searching, he realizes Julie is using him as an escape and that he really desires Billy's Queen Linet. Alan takes a confused and hurt Julie home to her parents. Meanwhile, Morgan's riders succumb to infighting. Alan finds Morgan and helps him realize that there can only be one king and he sees about signing with Bontempi. However, after seeing rowdy drunken behavior in his friends, Morgan and his riders return to Billy's fair to challenge for the crown. Billy announces his retirement and sets forth the rules: all knights compete, and any man knocked off his motorcycle is out. Morgan is victorious, and is crowned king by Billy. Angie, the troupe's mechanic, is then crowned queen by Morgan, after he realizes she is the woman he loves. Linet finds love with Alan. Billy leaves the troupe, accompanied by the silent eagle-crested knight, and returns to thrash the crooked cop. While riding again, Billy, weak and hallucinatory from loss of blood from his injury, has a vision of riding an actual horse. Immediately afterwards he is struck by an oncoming truck. The entire troupe gathers at Billy's funeral to say farewell to its fallen king.

George Romero has claimed the medieval hobbyist organization, the Society for Creative Anachronism, to be one inspiration for the film. A shorter cut of the film (running 102 minutes) was released in Europe. In the movie's credits, the writer Stephen King is referred to as \\"Hoagie man,\\" as he makes a few sarcastic comments during the troupe's first performance while munching on a large sandwich. Critical reception Christopher John reviewed Knightriders in Ares Magazine #9 and commented that \\"[with] the exceptional soundtrack, excellent photography, sharp writing, directing and editing, let alone the performances of a well trained cast, it is worth the time and effort to see Knightriders. It is the best movie of 1981 so far.\\" Tony Williams, in his book The Cinema of George A. Romero, said \\"Knightriders is a highly personal and sincere film revealing Romero's Utopian ideals in a cinematically allegorical manner. Although flawed by its long running time and some over-emphatic dialogue scenes, it is nonetheless one of the directors's major achievements which deserves better recognition.Williams, Tony.

It is worn by Sikh men who cut their hair and other guests when they are in a Gurdwara. Covering the head is respectful in Sikhism and if a man is not wearing a turban, then a rumƒÅl must be worn before entering the Gurdwara. RumƒÅls are also worn by Sikh children on their topknot, and by Sikh males while engaging in athletic activities. In most Gurdwaras, there is often a basket of rumƒÅls outside for welcoming in more guests. If there are no rumƒÅls supplied by the Gurdwara then a clean and plain handkerchief is the most suitable cloth to use. Outside the context of Sikhism, a rumƒÅl is simply the Urdu, Hindi, Nepali and Bengali word for handkerchief, and will be understood as such. Its association with Sikhism is not implied. The rumƒÅl was used by the Thugees in India as a method of strangulation. A coin was knotted in one end of the scarf, and would be swung around the neck of the victim, who would then be strangled.

The eastern half of the area is dominated by the Broadwater Farm Estate (\\"BWFE\\"), a Corbusian experiment in high-density social housing, dominated by concrete towers connected by walkways, built in the late 1960s using cheap but fire-vulnerable pre-fabricated concrete panels. The western half of the area is taken up by Lordship Recreation Ground, one of north London's largest parks. Broadwater Farm in 2011 had a population of 4,844.14 Output areas within the West Green ward make up Broadwater Farm and all have a N17 Postcode http://ukcensusdata.com/west-green-05000282#sthash.W4nK4B0.xrMyJkWE.dpbs The estate is owned by Haringey London Borough Council. Following the publication of Alice Coleman's Utopia on Trial in 1985, the area acquired a reputation as one of the worst places to live in the United Kingdom. This perception was exacerbated when serious rioting erupted later that year. However, following a major redevelopment programme, crime rates dropped dramatically, and the burglary rate was virtually zero percent in 2005. Well known for its large Afro-Caribbean heritage, it is one of the most ethnically diverse locations in London; in 2005 its official population of 3,800 included residents of 39 different nationalities. Broadwater Farm was completed in the early 1970s and built using the same Taylor Woodrow-Anglian system of prefabricated panels as Ronan Point. In June 2018, following tests conducted after the Grenfell Tower fire, Haringey Council announced hundreds of families would have to be evacuated because eleven of the towers are at risk of catastrophic collapse in the event of a fire. At least two may have to be demolished. Location The Moselle valley, 1619 (South shown at the top of the map). Broadwater Farm is situated in the valley of the Moselle, approximately six miles (10 km) north of the City of London. It is situated in a deep depression immediately south of Lordship Lane, between the twin junctions of Lordship Lane and The Roundway. It is immediately adjacent to Bruce Castle, approximately 547 yards (500 m) from the centre of Tottenham, and 1.2 miles (2 km) from Wood Green. History =Early history= Until the opening of the nearby Bruce Grove railway station on 22 July 1872 the area was still rural, although close in proximity to London and the growing suburb of Tottenham. Aside from a small group of buildings clustered around neighbouring Bruce Castle, the only buildings in the area were the farmhouse and outbuildings of Broadwater Farm, then still a working farm. Broadwater Farm, 1892 Following construction of the railways to Tottenham and Wood Green, suburban residential development in the surrounding area took place rapidly. However, due to waterlogging and flooding caused by the River Moselle, Broadwater Farm was considered unsuitable for development and remained as farmland. By 1920, Broadwater Farm was the last remaining agricultural land on Lordship Lane, surrounded by housing on all sides. Despite being deep in the Moselle valley, the Estate dominates the area. The mural on the Debden building is more than twice the height of the neighbouring Victorian houses. In 1932 Tottenham Urban District Council purchased Broadwater Farm. The western half was drained and converted for recreational use as Lordship Recreation Ground, while the eastern half was kept vacant for prospective development and used as allotments. Heavy concrete dikes were built to reduce flooding of the Moselle in Lordship Recreation Ground, whilst on the eastern half of the farm, the river was covered to run in culvert as far as Tottenham Cemetery. =Broadwater Farm Estate= In 1967, construction of the Broadwater Farm Estate began on the site of the allotments. An area of the southeastern part of the park was used to replace the allotments destroyed by the new construction. As initially built, the estate contained 1,063 flats, providing homes for 3,000-4,000 people. The design of the estate was inspired by Le Corbusier, and characterised by large concrete blocks and tall towers. 750px Because of the high water table and the flood risk caused by the Moselle, which flows through the site, no housing was built at ground level. Instead, the ground level was entirely occupied by car parks. The buildings were linked by a system of interconnected walkways at first floor level known as the \\"deck level\\". Shops and amenities were also located on the deck level. While this reduced flood risk for residences and businesses, it resulted in there being no \\"eyes on the street\\" at ground level, and decreased the feeling of community. The 12 interconnected buildings were each named after a different World War II RAF aerodrome. The most conspicuous buildings are the very tall Northolt and Kenley towers, and the large ziggurat-shaped Tangmere block. =Deterioration= Layout of the Broadwater Farm Estate By 1973, problems with the estate were becoming apparent; the walkways of the deck level created dangerously isolated areas which became hotspots for crime and robbery, and provided easy escape routes for criminals. The housing was poorly maintained by authorities. It suffered badly from water leakages, pest infestations (including a serious outbreak of cockroaches) and electrical faults. More than half of the people offered accommodation in the estate refused it, and the majority of existing residents had applied to be re-housed elsewhere. In 1976, less than ten years after the estate opened, the Department of the Environment concluded that the estate was of such poor quality that the only solution was demolition. While residents objected to conditions on the estate, some also opposed the demolition plan. Relations between the community and the local authority became increasingly confrontational. A process of redevelopment began in 1981, but was hampered by a lack of funds and an increasingly negative public perception of the area. Utopia on Trial Hawkinge block, showing the building constructed on a deck of stilts above the floodplain, and the remnants of the deck-level walkway running along the first floor. By the time Alice Coleman's critique of 1960s planned housing, Utopia on Trial (1985), was published, the estate was regarded as being representative of unsuccessful large-scale social housing projects. When a major exhibition by Le Corbusier in the mid-1980s was unable to attract sponsorship, the refusal of sponsors to be associated with his name was attributed to the \\"Broadwater Farm factor\\". The book's criticism of alleged \\"lapses of civilised behaviour\\" on Le Corbusier-inspired estates, claiming that residents of such buildings were far more likely to commit and to be victims of anti-social behaviour, were highly influential on the Thatcher government. Although the book focused on Tower Hamlets and Southwark and did not discuss Broadwater Farm, by the time it was published, the estate was becoming synonymous with this type of housing. The government began to put pressure on Haringey London Borough Council to improve the area. Tenants' Association and the Youth Association The Tangmere ziggurat block Although the demographics of Broadwater Farm at the time were roughly 50% black and 50% white, the Tenants' Association was all white. It was regarded with increasing distrust by black residents and those whites who were not connected with the Association. In 1981, residents set up the rival \\"Youth Association\\". It was praised by many members of the local black community for challenging the Special Patrol Group's perceived harassment of local youths and of black residents of the estate. In 1983, the council gave the Tenants' Association an empty shop to use as an office and a vague authority to \\"deal with local problems\\". This apparent favoritism heightened antagonism between the Tenants' Association and Youth Association, which in turn set up its own youth club, advice centre, estate watchdog and local lobbying group. Early regeneration projects Despite a lack of funds and willingness on the part of the council to commit to regeneration, by 1985 progress was made in solving the area's problems. Pressure from the Tenants' Association and the Youth Association forced the council to open a Neighbourhood Office. In 1983, a tenants' empowerment agency, Priority Estates Project, was appointed to coordinate residents' complaints and concerns. Residents were included on interview panels for council staff dealing with the estate. Kenley and Northolt towers and Hornchurch block.A number of initiatives aimed at providing activities for disaffected local youths and at integrating the mixture of ethnic communities in the area appeared to be succeeding; Sir George Young, then Minister for Inner Cities, secured significant funding for improvements. Broadwater Farm began to be seen as a case study in regenerating a failed housing development. Princess Diana paid a visit to the estate in February 1985, to commend the improvements being made, but much of the apparent progress was superficial. The problems caused by the deck-level walkways had not been solved; children from Broadwater Farm were still under- achieving academically in comparison to the surrounding areas; the unemployment rate stood at 42%; and there was a mutual distrust between the local residents--particularly those from the Afro-Caribbean community--and the predominantly White British and non-local police force. =Broadwater Farm riot= There had been earlier riots in Brixton and in Handsworth in Birmingham, which were indicative of a period of rising racial tension, during which some police methods such as raids, saturation policing and stop and search tactics increased the frustration of some members of the black community. Floyd Jarrett, whose home was about a mile from the Farm, was arrested by police on 5 October 1985, having given false details when stopped in a car with an allegedly false tax disc. While he was in custody, four officers attended his home to conduct a search. During the search, his mother Cynthia Jarrett collapsed and died. It has never been satisfactorily concluded how and why Cynthia Jarrett died, and whether it was a heart attack or due to police actions. Tangmere block, with its distinctive ziggurat structure. The holes in the wall at first floor level left by the demolition of the deck- level walkways are clearly visible.The next day, 6 October 1985, saw a small demonstration outside Tottenham police station, which initially passed off relatively peacefully other than a bottle being thrown through one of the station's windows. At 3.15 pm two officers were attacked and seriously injured by the crowd, suffering gunshot wounds. Three journalists were also treated for gunshot wounds. Murder of PC Keith Blakelock At 6.45 pm a police van answering a 999 call to Broadwater Farm was surrounded and attacked. As further police officers made their way to the area, rioters erected barricades on the deck level and the emergency services withdrew from the deck level. At 9.30 pm fire broke out in a newsagent's shop on the deck level of the Tangmere block. Firefighters attempting to put out the fire came under attack, and police attended to assist them. As the situation escalated, police and firefighters withdrew. In the withdrawal, PCs Keith Blakelock and Richard Coombes became separated from other officers. A group of around 40 people attacked them with sticks, knives and machetes, leading to PC Blakelock's death and serious injuries to PC Coombes. As news of the death spread, the rioting subsided. Local council leader Bernie Grant claims to have been misquoted as saying that \\"What the police got was a bloody good hiding\\". Three local residents, Mark Braithwaite, Engin Raghip and Winston Silcott, were convicted of PC Blakelock's murder. However, three years later their convictions were overturned when it was discovered that police notes of their interviews had been tampered with. The person or persons guilty of the murder have never been identified but in 2010, a man was arrested on suspicion of murdering PC Blakelock. =Reconstruction= \\"Waterfall\\" mural After the events of 1985, Broadwater Farm became the focus of an intensive ¬£33 million regeneration programme in response to the problems highlighted by the riots. The all-white Tenants Association was restructured more accurately to reflect the community, and residents' concerns seriously addressed by the authorities. A local management team was brought in to oversee improvements to the estate and to collect rents and enforce regulations, instead of continuing to attempt to run the estate centrally from Haringey Council's central offices. The deck level was dismantled and the overhead walkways demolished, with the shops and amenities relocated to a single ground-level strip of road to transform the semi-derelict Willan Road into a \\"High Street\\" for the area. The surrounding areas were landscaped and each building redesigned to give it a unique identity. A network of council-run CCTV cameras was installed to monitor the streets and car parks, and each building staffed by a concierge to deter unwanted visitors. Two giant murals were painted which now dominate the area, one of a waterfall on the side of Debden block and one depicting Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., John Lennon and Bob Marley on Rochford block. Disused shops left empty following the withdrawal of businesses after the riots were converted into low-cost light industrial units to provide employment opportunities for residents and prevent capital from flowing out of the area. Since the redevelopment, the flow of people leaving the estate has slowed to a trickle, and there is now a lengthy waiting list for housing. Demolition proposed Following tests conducted in the wake of the 2017 Grenfell Tower disaster, Haringey Council announced on 20 June 2018 the evacuation of two of the blocks. Eleven of the blocks were structurally unsafe and vulnerable to collapse if a gas pipe or gas canister were to explode or if vehicle were to strike the base of the buildings. Tangmere House, a six-storey block, and Northholt, an 18-storey block, are those worst affected, and would be demolished. The blocks were built using the same large-panel system used on Ronan Point, where a gas explosion in 1968 caused progressive collapse, killing four people. =Safety worries= Broadwater Farm was built using the same Taylor Woodrow-Anglian system of panels as Ronan Point. The domino-like system of large structural slabs speeded the building and allowed cheaper, less expert labour to be used to assemble the prefabricated panels. Even so, construction standards were ignored; mortar joints stuffed with newspaper reduced drying time and weakened the buildings. The blocks were inspected for safety in 1985 about the same time that gas was installed. Gaps, wide enough to see the flat below, were found between the external wall panels and the edge of the floor slabs. The gaps opened and closed depending on temperature. Fire could push them out of alignment and would cause the collapse of the building. Crime rates Since the regeneration, Broadwater Farm now has one of the lowest crime rates of any urban area in the world. In the first quarter of 2005, there were not any reported robberies or outdoor assaults on Broadwater Farm, and only a single burglary, from which all property was recovered and the suspect arrested; this compares with 875 burglaries, 50 robberies and 50 assaults in the third quarter of 1985, immediately preceding the riot. In an independent 2003 survey of all the estate's residents, only 2% said they considered the area unsafe, the lowest figure for any area in London. The estate also has the lowest rent arrears of any part of the borough.

The Broadwater Farm Community Centre is in the foreground. In 2005 the Metropolitan Police disbanded the Broadwater Farm Unit altogether as it was no longer required in an area with such a low crime rate. Places of interest Bruce Castle, once the home of Rowland Hill, inventor of the postage stamp, is on the north side of Lordship Lane immediately opposite Broadwater Farm. It was built by William Compton in the 16th century, and has been a public museum since 1906. It houses the public archives of Haringey Council, as well as a large display on the history of the postal system. Broadwater Farm is home to the Broadwater United football coaching programme. Set up in the aftermath of the events of 1985 with the intention of providing a focus for local youths, it has subsequently produced a number of professional footballers, including Jobi McAnuff, Lionel Morgan and Jude Stirling, son of the programme manager Clasford Stirling. Facilities =Schools= In 2007 a new Children's Centre opened on the estate, with nursery places for 104 children. It is considered one of the best designed nursery schools in the world, and won the Royal Institute of British Architects's Award for 2007. Broadwater Farm contains three primary schools, the general Broadwater Farm Primary School and the Moselle and William C Harvey schools for pupils with special needs. An ongoing programme is underway to integrate the three schools onto a single campus. Secondary education is provided by nearby Woodside High School, formerly named White Hart Lane School, approximately 200m outside the Broadwater Farm area. =Shops= Following the riots, many shops in Broadwater Farm withdrew from the area, and those that remained closed following the demolition of the deck level. Broadwater Farm is consequently extremely poorly served by shops. Haringey Council has provided 21 small \\"enterprise units\\" at a deliberately low cost to entice firms to open in the area, but these have proved hard to fill. However, Broadwater Farm is only 400m from the shops and supermarkets of Tottenham High Road, and approximately 2 km from the Shopping City supermall at Wood Green. =Transport= Due to the waterlogged ground and lack of population prior to the containment of the Moselle, Broadwater Farm was bypassed by the Underground. Bruce Grove railway station, 400m east of the estate, connects the area to central London. Because of the narrow streets, double-decker and bendy buses are unable to serve the area. From 11 February 2006 the W4 route, which utilises Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Dart to navigate the narrow streets and sharp bends, was diverted to run into the estate, providing direct public transport links for the first time. A number of other bus routes run along Lordship Lane, immediately to the north and Philip Lane to the south. Turnpike Lane Underground station is within walking distance to the south west. Demographics There are currently between 3800 and 4000 residents of Broadwater Farm. Following the events of 1985 a number of local residents left and were replaced mainly by recent immigrants particularly Kurds, Somalis and Congolese, but still maintains its large Afro-Caribbean heritage. In 2005, approximately 70% of residents were from an ethnic minority background and 39 different languages were spoken on the estate. In 2011, 13.4% of residents were White British, 11.9% were Asian and 36.1% were Black. The Broadwater Farm Estate following regeneration, as seen from Lordship Recreation Ground.

He is considered, like his contemporary and admirer Auguste Rodin, to be an artist working in a post-Impressionist style. Biography and works Rosso was born in Turin, where his father worked as a railway station inspector, and the family moved to Milan when Rosso was twelve. At the age of 24, after a spell in the army, Rosso enrolled at the Brera Academy, from which he would soon be expelled after punching a student who refused to sign a petition that Rosso had circulated demanding that live models and body parts be used for the drawing classes, which was a standard practice in Italian academies at the time.Sharon Hecker, \\"Ambivalent Bodies: Medardo Rosso‚Äôs Brera Petition,\\" The Burlington Magazine 142, no. 1173 (December 2000): 773‚Äì77. In his 1889 almanac of living artists, Angelo de Gubernatis offered a romanticized portrait of Rosso's early years as an artist: > (He) rebelled at each school, with each method, with each Academy, abhoring > anything that smacked of trade, of artifice, soon found himself alone, > without support, without master, without counselors, and with a bunch of > captive and envious colleagues who tripped him, when he tried his way and to > demonstrate his abilities, his ingenuity. But the Biblical saying \\"Go > alone!\\" did not frighten him, even in those long daily vigils struggling > with a whole system which for many years had triumphed, despite the strong > supporters of this and that opponent, he felt his strength increase, > developed his talent, he conceived a vast new artistic horizon never before > seen, and began to work and hold it to the test.\\"Ribelle ad ogni scuola, ad > ogni metodo, ad ogni Accademia, abborrendo tutto ci√≤ che sa di mestiere, di > artifizio, si trov√≤ presto solo, senza appoggio, senza maestro, senza > consiglieri con un branco di cattivi e d'invidiosi che gli si mettevano fra > i piedi ogni qualvolta egli tentava farsi strada e dar prova delle sue > attitudini, del suo ingegno.

Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 435. Starting in 1881 in Milan, Rosso began producing bronze busts and figures that reflected largely Realist influences, with works such as The Hooligan (1882) and Kiss Under the Lamppost (1882). Rosso's style began to change after 1882, possibly due to the discovery of Impressionism, and some of his first works during this period, including Portinaia (Concierge) (1883‚Äì84) and Carne altrui (Flesh of Others) (1883‚Äì84) begin to \\"suggest a loss of detail in favor of sketchy modeling, flattened planes, and gently modulated surfaces to soften the play of light and shadow.\\"Sharon Hecker, \\"Medardo Rosso,\\" The Encyclopedia of Sculpture, ed. Antonia Bostrom, vol. 3 (New York/London: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2004), 1471. Rosso never made preparatory drawings for his sculptures, opting instead to work directly with the clay from which he would then make a working model in plaster, which was then used to created the negative mold into which he would cast in bronze using the cire perdue method, and he also cast works in plaster, and, much later, wax with a plaster interior. Some art historians have suggested that Rosso traveled to Paris in 1884 and worked in the studio of sculptor Jules Dalou,Cf. Margaret Scolari Barr, Medardo Rosso (New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1963), 26, among others but no historical record has corroborated this. In Milan, Rosso continued to cast small-scale works throughout the mid-1880s, in addition to a series of entries for public monuments, such as a funeral monument to the critic Filippo Filippi. Rosso relocated to Paris in 1889, where he would live and work until after World War I. While in Paris, he met and impressed a number of influential personalities, including writer Emile Zola, whom Rosso convinced to say that he owned a cast of Birichino, thereby elevating the artist's stature,Sharon Hecker, \\"Everywhere and Nowhere: Medardo Rosso and the Cultural Cosmopolitan in Fin- de-si√®cle Paris,\\" in Strangers in Paradise: Foreign Artists and Communities in Modern Paris, 1870‚Äì1914, ed. Susan Waller and Karen L. Carter (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2015), 143‚Äì54. as well as the engineer and patron of the Impressionists Henri Rouart, of whom Rosso cast a portrait in bronze by 1890. During his Parisian period, Rosso also began to experiment with photography in his studio, and he photographed the works under a variety of lighting conditions, foci, and compositions in order to capture different impressions of these three-dimensional works, often further manipulating the printing process and cropping, folding, scratching, or painting the photographic prints to create focused glimpses of the sculptural subjects.Sharon Hecker, \\"Life, Work, and Era,\\" in Medardo Rosso: Experiments in Light and Form (St. Louis: Pulitzer Arts Foundation, 2016), 17-20. As a sculptor, one of Rosso's principal concerns was to subject the physical mass of sculpture to the transient and ephemeral effects of light. So by means of rough, spontaneous modeling that he would then cast in bronze, plaster, or wax. Rosso maintained a studio in Paris in which he created his own foundry, at a time when most sculptors sent their molds away to professional foundries to be cast. This freedom afforded Rosso the opportunity to manipulate the surfaces of his works in highly unorthodox ways, often retaining what others would have regarded as \\"casting errors\\" and elected not to clean away the plaster investment that would be left upon a bronze work after casting. To Rosso, these interventions were designed to create visual or optical effects that by which the materiality of sculpture, as central as it was to his practice, was subordinate the impression of the viewer: > Light being of the very essence of our existence, a work of art that is not > concerned with light has no right to exist. Without light it must lack unity > and spaciousness ‚Äî it is bound to be small, paltry, wrongly conceived, based > necessarily upon matter.... A work of sculpture is not made to be touched, > but to be seen at such or such a distance, according to the effect intended > by the artist. Our hand does not permit us to bring to our consciousness the > values, the bones, the colours‚Äîin a word, the life of the thing. For seizing > the inner significance of a work of art, we should rely entirely on the > visual impression and on the sympathetic echoes it awakens in our memory and > consciousness, and not on the touch of our fingers.Medardo Rosso, > ‚ÄúImpressionism in Sculpture, an Explanation,‚Äù The Daily Mail, October 17, > 1907, 10. Rosso maintained his studio in Paris, where he exhibited his sculptures and sold works to major collectors and museums. He established a friendship with Auguste Rodin, and the two artists exchanged works, although their relationship dissolved when, following a debate about artistic influence in the press, an embittered Rosso felt Rodin had failed to acknowledge his debt to him. In 1906, Rosso realized his last original subject with the work Ecce puer (Behold the Child); following series of unsuccessful attempts to create a portrait of a five-year-old Alfred William Mond, Rosso happened to glimpse him standing later behind a drawn curtain, inspiring the impression conveyed by the finished work.Margaret Scolari Barr, Medardo Rosso (New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1963), 58-59. In the last twenty years of his life he created no new original subjects, but focused on recasting previous works in different ways.Sharon Hecker, \\"Reflections on Repetition in the Sculpture of Medardo Rosso.\\" Medardo Rosso: Second Impressions. (exh. cat., Harvard Art Museums). Harry Cooper and Sharon Hecker. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2003. Toward the end of his life, he suffered from diabetes and died in Milan, aged 70, after the amputation of the affected leg in 1928. Exhibitions From 2 October to 23 November 1963, The Museum of Modern Art in New York presented Medardo Rosso, 1858-1928, the first major museum exhibition of the artist's work in the United States. In the exhibition catalogue, curator Margaret Scolari Barr wrote that \\"Rosso's art is complex, ambiguous, his vision poetic as much as objective.\\". From 17 October 2014, to 27 June 2015, the Center for Italian Modern Art presented an installation of sculpture, drawing, and experimental photography by the modernist artist, which revealed the range of an artist known primarily for his three-dimensional work. From 11 November 2016 to 13 May 2017, the Pulitzer Arts Foundation in St. Louis is presenting Medardo Rosso: Experiments in Light and Form, the largest exhibition of the artist's work in a US museum since the 1963 MoMA show.

Lord Scarman was appointed by then Home Secretary William Whitelaw on 14 April 1981 (two days after the rioting ended) to hold the enquiry into the riots. The Scarman report was published on 25 November 1981. The terms of reference for the enquiry were \\"to inquire urgently into the serious disorder in Brixton on 10‚Äì12 April 1981 and to report, with the power to make recommendations\\". 1981 Brixton riot The riot took place in Brixton, London on 11 April 1981. At the time when Brixton underwent deep social and economic problems ‚Äî high unemployment, high crime, poor housing, no amenities ‚Äî in a predominantly African-Caribbean community. The Metropolitan Police began Operation Swamp 81 at the beginning of April, aimed at reducing street crime, mainly through the heavy use of the so-called sus law, which allowed police to stop and search (and ultimately jail) individuals on the basis of a mere 'suspicion' of wrongdoing. Plain clothes police officers were dispatched into Brixton, and in five days almost 1,000 people were stopped and searched.YouTube Battle for Brixton, YouTube Battle for Brixton The riot resulted in 299 injuries to police and 65 injuries to members of the public; over a hundred vehicles were burned, including 56 police vehicles; and almost 150 buildings were damaged, with 28 burned. There were 82 arrests. Reports suggested that up to 5,000 people were involved in the riot.  Evidence  As part of the inquiry the following individuals and groups gave evidence: The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (Counsel - Mr J Hazan QC and Mr L Marshall Concern), the Council for Community Relations of Lambeth, London Borough of Lambeth, Brixton local community groups and clubs, the Brixton Legal Defence Group, and the Commission for Racial Equality.  Findings and recommendations  According to the Scarman report, the riots were a spontaneous outburst of built-up resentment sparked by particular incidents. Lord Scarman stated that \\"complex political, social and economic factors\\" created a \\"disposition towards violent protest\\". The Scarman report highlighted problems of racial disadvantage and inner city decline, warning that \\"urgent action\\" was needed to prevent racial disadvantage becoming an \\"endemic, ineradicable disease threatening the very survival of our society\\". Scarman found unquestionable evidence of the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of 'stop and search' powers by the police against black people. The report details the use of arbitrary roadblocks, the stopping and searching of pedestrians and mass detention (943 stops, 118 arrests and 75 charges). Operation Swamp 81 was conducted by the police without any consultation with the community or the home-beat officers. Liaison arrangements between police, community and local authority had collapsed before the riots and according to the Scarman report, the local community mistrusted the police and their methods of policing. Scarman recommended changes in training and law enforcement, and the recruitment of more ethnic minorities into the police force. According to the report \\"institutional racism\\" did not exist, but positive discrimination to tackle racial disadvantage was \\"a price worth paying\\".  Reception  The theme of the Scarman report was broadly welcomed, accepted and endorsed by politicians, police commissioners, the press and community relations officials. Some of the report's recommendations were implemented. \\"Hard policing\\" continued and new measures were taken to create greater public trust and confidence in official institutions. Multi-agency and \\"soft\\" policing emerged through community consultation, youth and \\"race relations\\" services. However, in 1999, the Macpherson Report stated that many of the Scarman report recommendations had been ignored and that, in fact, the Metropolitan Police was \\"institutionally racist\\". The Scarman report pushed the issue of law and order, and specifically policing, onto the mainstream agenda. The debate in the House of Parliament to mark the publication of the Scarman report on the 26 November 1981 had as its theme \\"law and order\\" and the then leader of the Liberal Party, David Steel, argued that \\"urgent action\\" to prevent a drift into lawlessness was necessary. A subsequent debate on March 1982 referenced the events of 1981 and focused on the impact of street violence, crime, decaying urban conditions, and the danger of \\"more violence to come\\" if changes in both police tactics and social policy were not swiftly introduced. While both the Conservative and Labour speakers in the parliamentary debate on the riots accepted the need to support the police, substantial disagreement centred on the issue of what role social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the streets. As a consequence of the Scarman report a new code for police behaviour was put forward in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984; and the act also created an independent Police Complaints Authority, established in 1985, to attempt to restore public confidence in the police. \\"Community relations\\" and \\"institutional racism\\" Scarman reported a shift from a concern about \\"race relations\\" to \\"community relations\\". According to Paul Rich, Lord Scarman's views expressed in the Scarman report most closely resembled that of the mid-Victorian era. Scarman was concerned with the \\"plight\\" of the ethnic communities in UK inner cities and their relationship with the rest of the national \\"community\\". He concluded that it was essential that \\"people are encouraged to secure a stake in, feel a pride in, and have a sense of responsibility for their own area\\". While the importance of community involvement in policing was recognised, the Scarman report pointed to \\"community redevelopment and planning\\" as the main area of concern. Scarman called for a policy of \\"direct coordinated attack on racial disadvantage\\". The Scarman report sought to locate the riots in the social, economic and political context of the acute deprivation in Brixton at the time. Lord Scarman identified the causes of the riots in the pathology of the Caribbean family, in the question of bilingualism amongst Asian children and in the undefined problem of policing a multi-racial society. In doing so Scarman highlighted what Robert Beckford has termed a \\"pathological image of Black youth\\". According to the report: > \\"Without close parental support, with no job to go to, and with few > recreational facilities available the young Black person makes his life the > streets and the seedy, commercially-run clubs of Brixton. There he meets > criminals, who appear to have no difficulty obtaining the benefits of a > materialist society.\\" The Scarman report does not apportion blame to the police. While the report acknowledges that \\"ill considered, immature and racially prejudiced actions of some officers\\" contributed to the riots Lord Scarman only acknowledges \\"unwitting discrimination against Black people\\". The report concludes that \\"The allegation that the police are the oppressive arm of a racist state not only display a complete ignorance of the constitutional arrangements of controlling the police, it is an injustice to the senior officers of the force.\\" In his recommendations Scarman accepts that \\"hard\\" policing, such as stop and search operations, would be necessary in the future in areas characterised by severe social problems. Hence the Scarman report seeks to establish how policing could be enforced without provoking further outbreaks of disorder.

It was discovered on 15 September 1900, by German astronomers Max Wolf and Friedrich Schwassmann at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany. The C-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.6‚Äì3.6 AU once every 5 years and 5 months (1,987 days). Its orbit is tilted by 13 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.17. Based on assumptions made by the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link, the body has a low albedo of 0.06, a typical value for a carbonaceous asteroid. In 2014, photometric light-curve observations at the Los Algarrobos Observatory (OLASU, I38), Uruguay, has given a rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 in magnitude. It was the last among the first 500 numbered asteroids to have its period measured for the first time (also see 398 Admete). The minor planet was named by Max Wolf in honor and gratitude of U.S. optician John Brashear at Allegheny in Pennsylvania, who equipped Wolf's new telescope with state of the art optics (lenses for the 16-inch photographic doublet). Some of the finest astronomy equipment of the early 20th century were produced at Allegheny by Brashear. The body was the first discovery Wolf made with his new instrument. Wolf also expressed his gratitude by granting the naming of another of his discoveries to the American optician, who named it 484 Pittsburghia, after his home city. Brashear is also honored by a Martian and a lunar crater. The minor planet 5502 Brashear was later directly named after the famous American astronomer and instrument builder.

It was discovered on 21 September 1900, by astronomers Max Wolf and Arnold Schwassmann at the Heidelberg- K√∂nigstuhl State Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named for the ancient Hercynian Forest, known to the Romans as \\"Hercynia silva\\".  Orbit and classification  Hercynia is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.3‚Äì3.7 AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,896 days; semi- major axis of 3.00 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 13¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins two days after to its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Hercynia is a common S-type, while in the SMASS classification it is a rare L-type asteroid. Polarimetric observations also determined an L-type. Alternatively, the Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) characterized Hercynia as a metallic M-type asteroid. = Rotation period = Several rotational lightcurves of Hercynia have been obtained from photometric observations since 1985. Lightcurve analysis gave a consolidated, slightly longer-than average rotation period of 21.806 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.10 and 0.36 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, Hercynia measures between 33.70 and 42.27 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1435 and 0.191. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts an albedo of 0.1654 from IRAS, and derives a diameter of 38.57 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.64.

Family Aurelian Townshend was the son of John Townshend of Dereham Abbey, Norfolk. Both Aurelian and his sister, Frances, were born before 12 December 1583, at which date they are mentioned in the will of Thomas Townshend of Crimplesham, Norfolk. Aurelian was a third cousin of Sir Roger Townshend and of the historian Hayward Townshend (c. 1577 ‚Äì 1603√ó21).; . Townshend's mother was named Anne, and is said to have been the daughter of Sir Richard Catlin..Beal states that she was the daughter of Sir Robert Catlin (d.1574), Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench; however Baker states that Sir Robert Catlin's only daughter was named Mary, and that she married Sir John Spencer. Career Very little is well established about Townshend's life. He was one of the Cavalier poets, and his masque Tempe Restored was performed on Shrove Tuesday of 1632 and had in its cast Queen Henrietta Maria and fourteen court ladies. Robert Cecil directed Aurelian's education and sent him to Europe to study. Within three years, Townshend was back in England. He then spent time in France as Edward Herbert's friend and aide who \\"spoke French, Italian and Spanish in great perfection,\\" but this was for a year. In 1613, he became the librettist of Inigo Jones. He became a friend of Thomas Carew's, and wrote poetry for around five years. Carew referred to Townshend in his \\"In Answer of an Elegiacal Letter, upon the Death of the King of Sweden, from Aurelian Townshend, Inviting Me to Write on That Subject\\" (published in 1640), where he indicates that Townshend was more engaged in the political world than he. From such heights as the court masque, Townshend rapidly fell. In 1643, he appears as \\"a poore and pocky Poet, (who) would bee glad to sell an 100 verses now at sixpence a piece, 50 shillings an 100 verses\\" before the House of Lords, seeking protection from creditors. The \\"pocky\\"-ness implies that, with his debts, Townshend had acquired disease (although not necessarily venereal disease). Other than these few facts, little can be sure. According to Cokayne, Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford, married, as his second wife, shortly before 12 April 1673, Diana Kirke, daughter of George Kirke, 'the well known Groom of the Bedchamber', by his second wife, Mary Townshend, daughter of Aurelian Townshend. They had a son, Charles, who died as an infant, and with the death of the 20th Earl the heirs male of Aubrey de Vere, 10th Earl of Oxford, came to an end, 'and the earldom of Oxford, created in 1142, became extinct'.. Works Townshend's poetry is remarkably formal and simultaneously free. His language is delicate, and his lines musical. T. S. Eliot praised the musicality of Townshend's poetry, and Hugh Kenner argues that Townshend's mixture of formality and liberty set the stage for Andrew Marvell, while others consider him distinctly minor (e.g. Rumrich and Chaplin).

The ACIA is the first comprehensively researched, fully referenced, and independently reviewed evaluation of Arctic climate change and its impacts for the region and for the world. The project was guided by the intergovernmental Arctic Council and the non-governmental International Arctic Science Committee. Three hundred scientists participated in the study over a span of three years. The 140-page synthesis report Impacts of a Warming Arctic was released in November 2004, and the scientific report later in 2005.http://amap.no/acia/ The ACIA Secretariat is located at the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Subsequent studies The NOAA State of the Arctic Report 2006 updates some of the records of the ACIA report. Taken collectively, the observations presented in the NOAA report show convincing evidence of a sustained period of warm temperature anomalies in the Arctic, supported by continued reduction in sea ice extent, observed at both the winter maximum and summer minimum, and widespread changes in Arctic vegetation. The warming trend is tempered somewhat by shifts in the spatial patterns of land temperatures and ocean salinity and temperature. While there are still large region to region and multiyear shifts in the Arctic climate, the large spatial extent of recent changes in air temperature, sea ice, and vegetation is greater than observed in the 20th century. The NOAA report is a review of environmental conditions during the past five years relative to those in the latter part of the 20th century, conducted by an international group of twenty scientists who developed a consensus on information content and reliability.NOAA State of the Arctic Report 2006 As an annual follow-on activity to the 2006 NOAA State of the Arctic report, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Arctic Report CardNOAA. Arctic Report Card. Updated annually. presents annually updated, peer-reviewed information on recent observations of environmental conditions in the Arctic relative to historical records. The conclusion for 2010 is that a return to previous Arctic conditions is unlikely. Record temperatures across Canadian Arctic and Greenland, a reduced summer sea ice cover, record snow cover decreases and links to some Northern Hemisphere weather support this conclusion. In April 2008, the World Wildlife Fund's report, Arctic Climate Impact Science ‚Äì An Update Since ACIA was launched at the meeting of the Arctic Council. It provides a large, updated review of Arctic climate impact science since the 2005 ACIA. The full report can be freely downloaded from the WWF web site. =Arctic Biodiversity Assessment= ACIA called for improved capacity to monitor and understand changes in the Arctic and to improve and enhance long-term Arctic biodiversity monitoring. In response to this recommendation the Conservation of Arctic Flora & Fauna (CAFF) The Working Group of the Arctic Council has embarked upon the Arctic Biodiversity Assessment. The ABA will be used to identify gaps in the data record, identify the main stressors and key mechanisms driving change. It will synthesize existing data and research on Arctic biodiversity to form a baseline which will provide policy makers and conservation managers with a synthesis of the most current scientific research and traditional ecological knowledge. It will provide a much needed description of the current state of the Arctic's ecosystems and biodiversity. The ABA will serve as a baseline for use in global and regional assessments of Arctic biodiversity and form a key piece in the process of understanding what is happening and focusing efforts on those areas where it is most needed. The availability of such information in an easily accessible format will be of great value to the governments, organisations, and peoples of the Arctic region in their struggle to ensure the sustainability of arctic biodiversity and arctic communities. =Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program= In further response to the ACIA call for better monitoring CAFF has established the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (CBMP). The CBMP is an international network of scientists, government agencies, Indigenous organizations and conservation groups working together to harmonize and integrate efforts to monitor the Arctic's living resources. Its goal is to facilitate more rapid detection, communication, and response with respect to the significant biodiversity- related trends and pressures affecting the circumpolar world. The CBMP is the cornerstone program of the Arctic Council's Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna Working Group.

It was discovered on 22 October 1900, by German astronomer Max Wolf at the Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The X-type asteroid has a rotation period of 7.3 hours. It was named after Rembrandt's wife, Saskia van Uylenburgh.  Orbit and classification  Saskia is a core member of the carbonaceous Themis family (), one of the largest asteroid families named after 24 Themis. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.7‚Äì3.6 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (2,016 days; semi-major axis of 3.12 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 1¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg the night after its official discovery observation.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Saskia van Uylenburgh (1612‚Äì1642), wife of renowned Dutch painter Rembrandt (4511 Rembrandt). The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, this asteroid's spectral type is ambiguous, closest to a dark F-type asteroid, and somewhat similar to that of a C- and X-type (FCX), while in both the Tholen- and SMASS-like taxonomy of the Small Solar System Objects Spectroscopic Survey (S3OS2), Saskia is an X-type asteroid. It has also been characterized as a primitive P-type asteroid by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). = Rotation period = In April 2007, a rotational lightcurve of Saskia was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.36 magnitude (). In December 2016, an identical period with an amplitude of 0.28 magnitude was determined by Daniel Klinglesmith at Etscorn Campus Observatory , New Mexico (). This result supersedes two previous observations that gave a period of 7.34 and 7.349 hours, respectively (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, Saskia measures between 39.8 and 44.1 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.06 and 0.112, while the Japanese Akari satellite determined a diameter of 43.10 kilometers with an albedo of 0.069.

The promotion, aiming to boost sales during the global recession of the early 1990s, offered two complimentary roundtrip plane tickets to the United States, worth about ¬£600, to any customer purchasing at least ¬£100 in Hoover products. However, Hoover had been experiencing dwindling sales as a result of the economic downturn and a sharp increase in competing brands, and was not prepared for the consumer response to the promotion. They were counting on not many people actually applying and getting the tickets by making the application process and terms tough. They were also counting on the average purchase to be much more than ¬£100. The resulting demand was disastrous for the 84-year-old company. Hoover's response to these multi-million dollar losses was to cancel the ticket promotion after consumers had already bought the products and filled in forms applying for tickets. Reneging on the offer resulted in protests and legal action from customers who failed to receive the tickets they had been promised. The campaign was a financial disaster for the company and led to the loss of Hoover's Royal Warrant after a 2004 BBC Documentary. The European branch of the company was eventually sold to one of its competitors, Candy, having never recovered from the losses, the promotion and the subsequent scandal.  Prior to the promotion  The Hoover appliance company prior to the incident had held a 50% share of their corner of the market for almost 40 years. In the 1980s Hoover was operating under the parent company Maytag and was rapidly expanding with the potential to claim a larger share of a growing market. This period of expansion, however, coincided with the UK's entry into a major economic recession, and Hoover was beginning to face competition from newly established British vacuum companies such as Dyson. From 1987 to 1992, Hoover's profits fell from $147 million to $74 million, and their share of the UK vacuum cleaning market dropped. When several attempts at creating novel products (such as a talking vacuum cleaner) failed to stimulate interest, to correct their financial trajectory, Hoover's executives decided to create an exciting marketing promotion that would encourage the public to purchase what was quickly becoming mounting piles of unsold products. In order to do this, Hoover would offer free round trip airline tickets to the United States to individual customers who had bought at least ¬£100 worth of the unsold wares. Free flights promotion Hoover promised free airline tickets to any customer who purchased a Hoover product worth at least ¬£100. This meant that, on top of their cleaning appliance, the customer would also receive a round trip to the United States. The promotion garnered a huge response from the public and Hoover was not able to keep up with the demand. Expecting modest engagement, Hoover had partnered with a small (now defunct) airline company called JSI Travel, who were in a similar position: struggling under the weight of the recession and desperate to unload cheap flights. Hoover and JSI arranged a deal in which Hoover would unload huge amounts of excess products, while JSI Travel would sell bulk flights to Hoover while handling bookings. Hoover made the application process as arduous as possible in the hope that only a minor percentage of those who bought an appliance would get the flights. To attain the minimum amount of free tickets given away, the following strategy was put into place: * When a customer purchased a Hoover appliance for at least ¬£100 at certain select department stores, they had to mail in their receipt along with their application within 14 days of making their purchase. *Hoover then sent back a registration form which needed to be completed and returned within 14 days. *Hoover would then send out a travel voucher. The customer then had 30 days to choose three combinations of departure airports, dates and destinations. *Hoover retained the right to refuse the combinations selected by the customer, subsequently insisting that the customer select a further three alternatives. *Additionally, Hoover reserved the right to also refuse the alternatives and offer a combination of their own choosing. This meant that the customer's flight would take place on a date and from a location that was likely to be inconvenient, rendering the customer less likely to use the tickets. Hoover's slogan for their new promotion was \\"Two free flights! Unbelievable!\\", which immediately caught the attention of the British public. As it became increasingly apparent that Hoover did not have the means necessary to fulfil the promotion, they began to receive negative attention from the British press. The initial approach was to offer two round trip tickets to European destinations; this promotion proved extremely popular with customers. Few customers used the vouchers, so Hoover expanded the options to include destinations in the United States. The addition of American locations caused a surge in consumer response because the airline tickets held an approximate retail value of ¬£600 and could be attained for an outlay of just ¬£100. Consumers were increasingly purchasing the cheapest products available to satisfy the ¬£100 requirement, sometimes not returning to pick up their order. Hoover had to increase their production and hire new employees to meet the increased demand. Hoover had estimated that they would receive 50,000 applications, but the final total was around 300,000. JSI Travel folded as Hoover decided to extend ticket offers to the United States. Hoover increased complexity of the process to redeem the vouchers. Public response was vocal and resulted in protests and an extended court case that continued until 1998. Public response, repercussions and legal action The British public reacted angrily to the fiasco and Hoover's failed marketing attempt. One man, David Dixon, claimed that in addition to not receiving airline tickets, the Hoover washing machine he had purchased to obtain a trip to the USA had broken down. He claimed that a Hoover technician who had come to fix the machine had said, \\"If you think buying a washing machine's going to get you two tickets to America, you must be an idiot\\", which led him to take action against Hoover. In 1993, the Hoover Holidays Pressure Group was formed, led by Harry Cichy and Sandy Jack, to protest against the company's broken promises. After buying some shares in Hoover's parent company, Maytag, the pressure group went to the Maytag Annual General Meeting in Newton, Iowa. Jack expressed his concerns to the CEO of Maytag, Len Hadley, which made headline news. In 1994, Jack took Hoover to court over the free flight promotion. The BBC Watchdog programme's investigation of customer complaints about the promotion brought the matter to even wider public attention. A number of Hoover executives lost their jobs as a result of the fiasco, including William Foust, the Managing Director and President of Hoover; Brian Webb, Vice-President of Marketing; and Michael Gilbey, Director of Marketing Services. Despite the European division the company being sold to Candy in 1995, lawsuits concerning the fiasco continued into 1998. BBC documentary In 2004, a BBC documentary was made on the anniversary of Cichy and Jack's visit to Newton in 1994. Part of the Trouble at the Top series, the 'Hoover Flights Fiasco' was watched by 1.7 million viewers. As a result, the British Royal Family withdrew Hoover's Royal Warrant.

Lind (born July 9, 1947) is an American conservative author, described as being aligned with paleoconservatism. He is the author of many books and one of the first proponents of fourth-generation warfare (4GW) theory. Director of The American Conservative Center for Public Transportation. He used the pseudonym Thomas Hobbes in a column for The American Conservative. Early life Lind graduated from Dartmouth College in 1969 and from Princeton University in 1971, where he received a master's degree in history. In 1973, having grown tired of doctoral work at Princeton, Lind wrote to his Senator Robert Taft Jr. requesting his help in securing a job with Amtrak. In response, Taft instead offered Lind a job in his office, where he eventually began analyzing defense policy (Taft being a member of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services). Views on warfare and US military In 1989, alongside several U.S. officers, Lind helped to originate fourth-generation war (4GW) theory. Lind served as a legislative aide for Senator Robert Taft, Jr., of Ohio from 1973 through 1976 and held a similar position with Senator Gary Hart of Colorado from 1977 to 1986. He is the author of the Maneuver Warfare Handbook (Westview Press, 1985) and co-author, with Gary Hart, of America Can Win: The Case for Military Reform. With Bruce Gudmundsson, Lind hosted the program Modern War on the now-defunct satellite television network NET. Lind has written for the Marine Corps Gazette, Defense and the National Interest, (D-N-I.net), and The American Conservative.Lind, William. A Tea Party Defense Budget, The American Conservative (February 2011) According to writer Robert Coram's book Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed The Art of War, during lectures on maneuver warfare, Lind was sometimes criticized for having never served in the military, for having \\"never dodged a bullet, he had never led men in combat, he had never even worn a uniform and clearly spending way too much time playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.\\" Coram writes that when challenged by an officer, Lind \\"cut him off at the knees.\\"Robert Coram, Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed The Art of War, published 2004 by Back Bay Books, p. 383 William S. Lind is a believer in the idea that \\"The Great Replacement\\" is an aspect of \\"4th Generation Warfare\\". Political career and related writings Lind was the Director of the Center for Cultural Conservatism at the Free Congress Foundation. He advocates a Declaration of Cultural Independence by cultural conservatives in the United States, in the belief that the federal government ceased to represent their interests and began to coerce them into negative behavior and affect their culture in a negative fashion. The foundation believes that American culture and its institutions are headed for a collapse and that cultural conservatives should separate themselves from that calamity. It also supports setting up independent parallel institutions with a right to secession and a highly- decentralized nature that would rely on individual responsibility and discipline to remain intact but prevent the takeover of the institutions by those hostile to cultural conservatism. Lind has authored and co-authored (with Paul Weyrich) a number of monographs on behalf of the Free Congress Foundation attempting to persuade American conservatives to support government funding for mass transit programs, especially urban rail transit. The pair also write about Cultural Marxism as being an organized conspiracy against the traditional Christian values of America. Lind was Associate Publisher of a quarterly magazine called The New Electric Railway Journal from its launch in 1988 until 1996,Kunz, Richard R. (Spring 1996). \\"From the Editor: Cutting the Cord\\". The New Electric Railway Journal, p. 2. and from January 1994, he also co-hosted a monthly program about light rail on the National Empowerment Television network; the program used the same name as the magazine.\\"Watch our trolleys take to the air\\". The New Electric Railway Journal, Spring 1994, p. 31. As a paleoconservative, Lind has often criticized neoconservatives in his commentaries. While not a libertarian, he has also written for LewRockwell.com. He is a self-proclaimed conservative and monarchist. He is a supporter of a non-interventionist foreign policy. In his column of December 15, 2009, Lind announced that he was leaving the staff of the Center unexpectedly and that his series of articles was on hiatus. = Other views = Lind has advocated for police to have rocket-propelled grenades as standard issue and for a return to death by hanging as a common sentence for crime in \\"urban areas.\\" Lind is a key proponent of the cultural Marxism conspiracy theory and asserts that Marxists control much of modern popular media and that political correctness can be directly attributed to Karl Marx. =Fiction= Lind also wrote Victoria: A Novel of 4th Generation War, in which a group of \\"Christian Marines\\" leads an armed resistance against cultural Marxism as the American federal government collapses. =Criticism= In the Southern Poverty Law Center report \\"Reframing the Enemy\\" (2003), Bill Berkowitz said that Lind was the principal promoter and popularizer of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, which claims that a cabal of Jewish- Germans philosophers, the Frankfurt School, had seized control of American popular culture, and have been systematically subverting the Christian nation that is the US. That the conspiracists‚Äô preoccupation with the Jewishness of most Frankfurt School intellectuals confirms that Cultural Marxism is an anti- Semitic canard. The SPLC reported that in 1999 Lind wrote, \\"The real damage to race relations in the South came, not from slavery, but [from] Reconstruction, which would not have occurred if the South had won [the civil war].\\" In ‚ÄúThe Widening Gap Between the Military and Society‚Äù (1997), journalist Thomas E. Ricks said that Lind's rhetoric of Marxist cultural subversion is different from the \\"standard right-wing American rhetoric of the ‚Äô90s\\", because Lind said that the \\"next real war we fight is likely to be on American soil.\\" In The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad (2003) Fareed Zakaria said that \\"There are those in the West who agree with bin Laden that Islam is the reason for the Middle East's turmoil.

It was discovered by astronomer Max Wolf at the Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany on 9 January 1901. The carbonaceous C-type asteroid (FX) has a rotation period of 12.9 hours. It was named after Megaera from Greek mythology.  Orbit and classification  Megaira is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2‚Äì3.4 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,712 days; semi-major axis of 2.8 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 10¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg Observatory with its official discovery observation on 9 January 1901.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Megaera, the avenging spirit from Greek mythology. She is one of the three Erinyes (Furies), who bring retribution on those guilty of sins. The was also mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (). It was the first numbered minor planet detected in the 20th century.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification-SMASS classification, Megaira is closest to a dark F-type asteroid, and somewhat similar to an X-type, though with an unusual (U) and noisy spectra (:). In the Bus‚ÄìBinzel SMASS classification it is a common carbonaceous C-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In March 2019, a rotational lightcurve of Megaira was obtained from photometric observations by Frederick Pilcher. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of magnitude (). The result supersedes previously published period determinations. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Megaira measures between 55.09 and 85.50 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.03 and 0.06. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link takes an albedo of 0.0469 from Petr Pravec's revised WISE data and calculates a diameter of 78.29 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.47.

Family Logan was born in Dennistoun, Glasgow, a member of a family of entertainers; the tradition began with his parents who were the music hall act Short and Dalziel. His aunt, from whom he took his stage surname, was Broadway performer Ella Logan. His sister was actress and singer Annie Ross, and his brother is vocalist Buddy Logan. Career Educated at Gourock High School, Inverclyde, and latterly Bellahouston Academy, Glasgow, Logan left school at the age of 14. His family, in the 1930s and 1940s, toured the small music halls of Scotland and Northern Ireland and ran seasons at the Metropole, Glasgow and in the Theatre, Paisley, where Logan became house manager for the family. He was in pantomime by 1944, playing the cat in Dick Whittington and His Cat, and soon became a comedy star with BBC Scotland. His connection with pantomime continued throughout his life, most famously with the long-running pantomimes produced by Howard & Wyndham in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Aberdeen.Alhambra Glasgow by Graeme Smith, published 2011The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation by Graeme Smith, published 2008 Logan, starring with Jack Radcliffe and Eve Boswell, held the record number of performances of the famed Five Past Eight shows staged each summer at the Alhambra Theatre. Logan purchased the Empress Theatre for ¬£80,000 in 1964. He refurbished it, reopening it as the New Metropole. One of the last events to be staged there was the first Scottish production of the rock musical Hair. His first acting role was in the film Floodtide (1949), a drama set on Clydeside. His other film roles included The Wild Affair (1964), Carry On Abroad (1972), Carry On Girls (1973), Captain Jack (1999), and The Debt Collector (1999) with Billy Connolly. His London stage debut came in The Mating Game (1973). He staged an adaptation of Oor Wullie, the Sunday Post comic strip character, for the Dundee stage. His one-man musical based on the life of Scottish entertainer Sir Harry Lauder was called Lauder (1976). Logan collected Lauder memorabilia, which is now housed in the Scottish Theatre Archive at the University of Glasgow. Other theatrical events included The Entertainer (1984), Brighton Beach Memoirs (1989), Bill Bryden's The Ship, The Comedians (1991), On Golden Pond (1996) and Death of a Salesman at the Pitlochry Festival (1992). In 1991, he had a supporting role in the Swedish comedy film Den ofrivillige golfaren which was partly filmed in Scotland. Logan was awarded an honorary doctorate by Glasgow Caledonian University (1994), honoured with an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for \\"services to Scottish theatre\\" in 1996, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in 1998. His last two performances were at Pitlochry Festival Theatre and Glasgow's Pavilion Theatre respectively. An extensive archive of his personal papers and performance ephemera is now held by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland archives. Logan published his autobiography, It's a Funny Life, in 1998.

Originally published in 1955, it was also released by Fontana Books in 1960. MacLean's experiences in the Royal Navy during World War II provided the background and the Arctic convoys to Murmansk provided the basis for the story, which was written at a publisher's request after he'd won a short-story competition the previous year. Some editions carry a prefatory note disavowing any connection between the fictional HMS Ulysses and the of the same name. Plot The novel features HMS Ulysses, a light cruiser that is well armed and among the fastest ships in the world. Her crew is pushed well beyond the limits of endurance and the book starts in the aftermath of a mutiny. Ulysses puts to sea again to escort FR-77, a vital convoy heading for Murmansk. They are beset by numerous challenges: an unusually fierce Arctic storm, German ships and U-boats, as well as air attacks. All slowly reduce the convoy from 32 ships to only five. Ulysses is sunk in a failed attempt to ram a German cruiser after all her other weapons had been destroyed. This echoes events in which British G-class destroyer and , an armed merchant cruiser, sacrificed themselves by engaging larger opponents. The book uses a set of events to paint moving portrayals of the crew and the human aspects of the war. Maclean's heroes are not especially motivated by ideals, they rarely excel at more than one task and they are overcome by a respectable enemy. It is their resilience that pushes these seamen to acts of heroism. The realism of the descriptions, the believable motivations of the characters and the simplicity of the line of events make the story all the more credible, though the number of coincidental accidents that plague the crew is startling. Ships featured in HMS Ulysses HMS Ulysses is similar to the real cruisers. MacLean had served in of that class. HMS Stirling an obsolete World War I-era of the Ceres sub-group (referred to as Cardiff Class in the novel). Stirling is virtually untouched during most of the novel, until the final act where Stirling is repeatedly attacked by dive bombers . Aircraft carriers Defender, Invader, Wrestler and Blue Ranger, are American-built escort carriers. Accidents and enemy attacks conspire to remove all the aircraft carriers from service before the convoy is even halfway to Russia. Defender in particular is rendered inoperable due to freak accident which results in the aircraft flight deck being partially torn off during a heavy storm. Smaller escorts included HMS Sirrus, an S-class destroyer, the most newly built warship in the escort group. HMS Vectra and HMS Viking, World War I-vintage s. HMS Portpatrick, a , another obsolete World War I design. HMS Baliol, a Type 1 described as \\"diminutive\\" and completely unseaworthy for the harsh weather of the North Atlantic. Furthermore, there is HMS Nairn, a , HMS Eager, a Fleet Minesweeper, and HMS Gannet, a sloop, nicknamed Huntley and Palmer due to her boxy superstructure resembling a biscuit tin. Background Alistair Maclean had written a short story, which was published to acclaim. A literary agent asked him to write a novel and Maclean originally refused, believing there was no future in it. However his boat business failed so he decided to write a novel. The book was based on real life convoys Maclean had participated in when a sailor aboard HMS Royalist. Maclean later described his writing process: > I drew a cross square, lines down representing the characters, lines across > representing chapters 1-15. Most of the characters died, in fact only one > survived the book, but when I came to the end the graph looked somewhat > lopsided, there were too many people dying in the first, fifth and tenth > chapters so I had to rewrite it, giving an even dying space throughout. I > suppose it sounds cold blooded and calculated, but that's the way I did it. Reception The book sold a quarter of a million copies in hardback in England in the first six months of publication. It went on to sell millions more. Literary significance and criticism The novel received good critical notices, with a number of reviewers putting it in the same class as two other 1950s classic tales of World War II at sea, Herman Wouk's The Caine Mutiny and Nicholas Monsarrat's The Cruel Sea. Allusions/references from other works The same background of the World War II Murmansk convoys, with the combination of extreme belligerent action and inhospitable nature pushing protagonists to the edge of endurance and beyond, appears in Dutch novelist Jan de Hartog's The Captain (1967). Comparisons may also be drawn with Wolfgang Ott's 1957 novel Sharks and Little Fish, written from the viewpoint of a sailor who serves on surface ships and submarines of the World War II German navy, the Kriegsmarine. The use of ship names derived from classical mythology is a well-established practice of the Royal Navy. However, commentator Bill BaleyBill Baley. The Enduring Homer, Chapter 3 suggests that the choice of Ulysses might have been less than accidental. \\"Unlike in Joyce's famous book, there are here no specific scenes clearly reminiscent of specific ones in Homer's Odyssey; but overall, it was Homer's Ulysses who gave Western culture the enduring template of a long and harrowing sea voyage where peril waits at every moment and of which few of the crew would survive to see the end.\\" References to HMS Ulysses in other works Valentin Pikul chose a quotation from the novel as an epigraph to his Requiem for Convoy PQ-17. Film, TV and theatrical adaptations =Abandoned film projects= Film rights were bought by Robert Clark of Associated British Picture Corporation in the 1950s for ¬£30,000. He arranged for a script to be written by R. C. Sheriff, who had just adapted The Dambusters for Associated British; because of the amount of naval detail included, it proved troublesome for Sherriff. However, ABPC never made the film. Another proposed film version was announced by the Rank Organisation at the Cannes Film Festival in 1980 but then was abandoned when Rank pulled out of filmmaking. HMS Ulysses has never been filmed but it was adapted by Nick McCarty for a BBC Radio 4 play of the same name which was first aired on 14 June 1997 in the Classic Play series. It starred Sir Derek Jacobi as Captain Vallery and Sir Donald Sinden as Admiral Starr.

Discovery It was discovered by Max Wolf and Luigi Carnera on January 17, 1901, and was assigned the provisional designation 1901 FX. It was named after Tisiphone of Greek mythology. Physical properties A number of positional observations of Tisiphone were carried out in 1907, 1913, and 1914. In 1992 a simple check of 466 Tisiphone's position was made by the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers (ALPO). The asteroid was found to be in the expected position to within observational errors. Further checks were carried out in 1996, and 2006 (pdf) with the asteroid in its expected position both times. In 1997 Tisiphone was studied by Worman and Christianson at the Feder Observatory located near Minnesota State University, Moorhead, with the goal of determining its rotational period. A period of 8.824 ¬± 0.009 was arrived at, with the lightcurve data showing two distinct maxima and minima in its rotation. In 2001 Lagerkvist et al. published their results on a study of the Cybele asteroid family, which includes 466 Tisiphone. Relative photometric observations of Tisiphone were carried out in 1998 and 1999 using the 1.2 m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory located at the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Astronomie in Heidelberg, Germany.

The carbonaceous asteroid was named for the housemaid of the discoverer's family.  Classification and orbit  Lina is a core member of the Themis family, an ancient population of carbonaceous outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.5‚Äì3.8 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (2,025 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 0.4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Lina was first observed at Heidelberg a few days prior to its official discovery observation. The body's observation arc begins with its identification as ' at Heidelberg in 1915, or 14 years after its official discovery observation.  Naming  This minor planet was named for \\"Lina\\", a domestic housemaid of the discoverer's family at Heidelberg. The members of Max Wolfs household figure prominently in the names of his discoveries, but background information on the name's origin behind most of them have been lost. Wolf also named 482 Petrina and 483 Seppina after the household's two dogs, a practice that was later discouraged by the IAU. Naming citation for Lina was first mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  It has been characterized as a CPF-type and P-type asteroid by Tholen and NEOWISE, respectively. = Photometry = In December 2006, a rotational lightcurve of Lina was obtained by American astronomer Robert Buchheim at Altimira Observatory () in California. Light-curve analysis gave a rotation period of 16.33 hours with a brightness variation of 0.15 magnitude (). Its odd light curve shows multiple peaks, contrary to the classically shaped double-peaks seen in bimodal light curves, that have two maximums and two minimums per rotation. Linas unusual triple-peak shape made it difficult to fit a period. Other photometric observations were taken by Edward Tedesco in the 1970s (8.3 hours; Œî mag; ), by Pierre Antonini and Raoul Behrend in January 2006 (16.478 hours; Œî0.18 mag; ), and by Scott Marks and Michael Fauerbach in February 2007 (16.54 hours; Œî0.13 mag; ). = Diameter and albedo = According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Lina measures between 58.60 and 69.34 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.043 and 0.06. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link still adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is an albedo of 0.043 and a diameter of 69.34 kilometers at an absolute magnitude of 9.83, while more recent results by NEOWISE and Spitzer tend toward a higher albedo of 0.06 and a shorter diameter of 58.60 and 59.7 kilometer, respectively.

Rhomphaias were weapons with a straight or slightly curved single-edged blade attached to a pole, which in most cases was considerably shorter than the blade. Although the rhomphaia was similar to the falx, most archaeological evidence suggests that rhomphaias were forged with straight or slightly curved blades, presumably to enable their use as both a thrusting and slashing weapon. The blade was constructed of iron and used a triangular cross section to accommodate the single cutting edge with a tang of rectangular cross section. Length varied, but a typical rhomphaia would have a blade of approximately 60‚Äì80 cm and a tang of approximately 50 cm. From the length of the tang, it can be presumed that, when attached to the hilt, this portion of the weapon would be of similar length to the blade. Usage Used almost exclusively by the Thracians, examples have been found dating from 300-400 BC. As a weapon, the rhomphaia was feared (like the falx) because of the cutting power afforded to it by its design. The falx forced the only documented change in Roman armour brought about by an encounter with a new weapon. After encountering the falx in Dacia, the Romans added extra reinforcing bars to their helmets to protect against the powerful blows of this weapon. According to some researchers, this weapon was developed by the Bessi, that were actively involved in mining and metalworking.–ë–æ–Ω–µ–≤, –ß–∞–≤–¥–∞—Ä. –ü—Ä–∞—Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –ø–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞. —Ç–æ–º 2 (–ë-–ö). –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è: –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—á–Ω–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ ¬´–ü—Ä–æ—Ñ. –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω –î—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤¬ª, 2008. , —Å—Ç—Ä. 24. Differences from the falx The rhomphaia's blade was straight or only slightly curved, while the falx's blade was significantly curved. Because its straighter blade facilitated a thrusting motion, as well as an overhead or sidewards hacking motion, the rhomphaia could be used by tightly packed troops as a defensive weapon. However, the straighter blade limited the use of the cutting edge. Rhomphaia in historical texts =Roman= Rhomphaia was first a \\"spear\\", later a \\"sword\\" (Plutarch: Life of Aemilius Paulus 18; Eustathius, on Iliad verse VI 166; Hesychius; also Luke 2:35 and the Revelation of John of Patmos, several times.). In Latin, it has the forms: *rumpia (Livy, Aulus Gellius, Ascon. ad Mil.) *romphea (Isidore of Seville.), *romphaea vel romfea (CGL 7, 212). W. Tomaschek listed the Macedonian rof√©ja, rufja \\"thunderbolt\\" and the Albanian rruf√´ as derivatives of that word. In Albanian folk beliefs the lightning was regarded as the \\"fire of the sky\\" (zjarri i qiellit) and was considered the \\"weapon of the deity\\" (arma/pushka e per√´ndis√´), indeed an Albanian word to refer to the lightning is rrufeja, related to the Thracian rhomphaia, an ancient pole weapon. The Thracian rhomphaia contains the stem *rump- in the Latin rumpo, -ere \\"to break, to tear\\". =Byzantine= A weapon called rhomphaia was also mentioned in Michael Psellos' Chronographia where he describes it as a \\"one-edged sword of heavy iron which they [the palace guards at Constantinople] carry suspended from the right shoulder\\". This was possibly a reference to the Varangian Guard and their two handed axe, probably a Dane axe. However, Niketas Choniates describes the bodyguards of the emperor Andronikos I Komnenos as removing \\"the two-edged swords from their shoulders\\". Being two-edged, these weapons do not resemble Dane axes.Choniates, p 148 It is also mentioned in Anna Komnene's Alexiad. She explains that during the battle, her father, Alexios I Komnenos, fought against the rebel Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder. Alexius happened upon a horse saddled for an emperor, which also had a number of grooms, some of whom \\"had in their hands the great iron swords which normally accompany the emperors\\".Anna Comnena, trans E. R. A. Sewter, The Alexiad, (1969, Penguin), Pp.42. However, Anna does not name these as rhomphaia, but her editor and translator E.R.A.

Lonetree (born November 6, 1961), son of a Winnebago father and Navajo mother, served nine years in prison for espionage. During the early 1980s, Lonetree was a Marine Corps Security Guard stationed at the Embassy of the United States in Moscow. Lonetree is the first U.S. Marine to be convicted of spying against the United States. Lonetree, who was stationed in Moscow as a guard at the U.S. Embassy in the early 1980s, confessed in 1987 to selling documents to the Soviet Union. Lonetree was seduced by a 25-year-old female KGB officer named \\"Violetta Seina\\" in that year. He was then blackmailed into handing over documents when he was assigned to Vienna, Austria. These documents included the blueprints of the U.S. Embassy buildings in Moscow and Vienna and the names and identities of U.S. undercover intelligence agents in the Soviet Union. He was tried in a military court in Quantico, Virginia and convicted of espionage on August 21, 1987. In May 1991, Lonetree filed an appeal, asking that his conviction be overturned because he had never learned the identity of one accuser, but this was denied. He initially received a 30-year sentence with a reduction in rank from E-5 to E-1, a fine of $5,000, the loss of all military pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Alfred M. Gray, Jr., recommended to the Secretary of the Navy that Lonetree's sentence be reduced from 30 to 15 years in a letter written in 1989 that said that the effect of Private Lonetree's actions \\"was minimal.\\" In addition, he said, the Marine's motivation \\"was not treason or greed, but rather the lovesick response of a naive, young, immature and lonely troop in a lonely and hostile environment.\\" His sentence was reduced to 15 years, but he was released in 1996 after serving 9 years at the United States Disciplinary Barracks.

The great helm or heaume, also called pot helm, bucket helm and barrel helm, is a helmet of the High Middle Ages which arose in the late twelfth century in the context of the Crusades and remained in use until the fourteenth century. The barreled style was used by knights in most European armies between about 1220 to 1350 AD and evolved into the frog-mouth helm to be primarily used during jousting contests. History Great helms were worn with cloth and fiber padding on the inside, here shown removed from the helmet. In its simplest form, the great helm was a flat-topped cylinder of steel that completely covered the head and had only very small openings for the eyes and mouth. Later designs gained more of a curved design, particularly on the top, to deflect or lessen the impact of blows. The great helm ultimately evolved from the nasal helmet, which had been produced in a flat-topped variant with a square profile by about 1180.Gravett, p. 17 From this type of helmet an intermediate type, called an 'enclosed helmet' or 'primitive great helm', developed near the end of the 12th century. In this helmet the expansion of the nasal produced a full face-plate, pierced for sight and breathing. This helmet was largely superseded by the true great helm by c. 1240.Gravett, Plate D and p. 54 A later variant with a more conical top is known as a 'sugarloaf helm'. In Spanish they are called yelmo de Zaragoza, referring to Zaragoza where they were introduced for the first time in the Iberian peninsula.David Nicolle, Medieval Warfare Sourcebook vol I Although the great helm offered vastly superior protection than previous helmets, such as the nasal helm and spangenhelm, it limited the wearer's peripheral vision, and in addition to being heavy, the mass-produced form (flat-topped without ventilation holes) provided little ventilation and could quickly overheat in hot weather. Knights usually wore the great helm over a mail coif (hood) sometimes in conjunction with a close-fitting iron skull cap known as a cervelliere. The later development of the cervelliere, the bascinet, was also worn beneath the great helm; men-at-arms would often remove the great helm after the first clash of lances, for greater vision and freedom of movement in melee combat. The bascinet had a mail curtain attached, a camail or aventail, which superseded the coif. Mail throat and neck defences such as these were made obsolete when plate gorgets were introduced, around 1400. The bascinet evolved from its early skull cap form to supersede the great helm for combat. The great helm fell into disuse during the 15th century; however it was used commonly in tournaments where a version of the great helm, the frog-mouthed tilting helm, evolved.  Decoration  von Pranckh family, 14th century, with the crest of two bullhorns. (Side view) The Great Helm was often blackened, lacquered or painted, and frequently bore decorations such as: * Ventilation decoration (crosses and symbols) * Visor (horizontal and vertical \\"cross\\") decorations * Crests, such as crowns, feathers, caps of maintenance, wings, lions, etc. Contemporary reenactors The great helm is today especially popular amongst live-action role players and used in Medieval reenactment of the 13th and 14th centuries. It is inexpensive, easy to manufacture with even rudimentary equipment (metal scissors, drill, rudimentary anvil, rivets and hammer), and provides good protection for the head against both sharp and blunt weapons. Its biggest drawback is the square edges, that crumple very easily under blunt force trauma, and poor ventilation and air circulation. This can make it very hot in warm weather, although not much heavier, hotter or more cumbersome than a number of other medieval helmet styles. However period-accurate methods of padding and suspending the helmet can drastically improve the wearer's experiences. Modern reenactment versions of great helms weigh 1.5 to 3 kg. They are sometimes but not always made from thicker steel than medieval originals yet are not usually overly heavy, cumbersome, or uncomfortable. Although visor slits are usually only some 20‚Äì30 mm wide, they do not greatly restrict the field of vision as they are very close to the wearer's eyes to reduce parallax.Source Noticeboard in Stafford Castle on 1 October 2011 medieval armoury.

Helminthic therapy, an experimental type of immunotherapy, is the treatment of autoimmune diseases and immune disorders by means of deliberate infestation with a helminth or with the eggs of a helminth. Helminths are parasitic worms such as hookworms, whipworms, and threadworms that have evolved to live within a host organism on which they rely for nutrients. These worms are members of two phyla; nematodes, which are primarily used in human helminthic therapy, and flat worms (trematodes). Helminthic therapy consists of the inoculation of the patient with specific parasitic intestinal nematodes (or other helminths). A number of such organisms are currently being investigated for their use as treatment including: Trichuris suis ova, commonly known as pig whipworm eggs; Necator americanus, commonly known as hookworms; Trichuris trichiura ova, commonly referred to as human whipworm eggs; and Hymenolepis diminuta, commonly known as rat tapeworm cysticerci. While the latter four species may be considered to be mutualists ‚Äì providing benefit to their host without causing longterm harm ‚Äì there are other helminth species that have demonstrated therapeutic effects but which also have a potential to cause less desirable or even harmful effects and therefore do not share the ideal characteristics for a therapeutic helminth. These include Ascaris lumbricoides, commonly known as human giant roundworm; Strongyloides stercoralis, commonly known as human roundworm; Enterobius vermicularis, commonly known as pinworm or threadworm; and Hymenolepis nana, also known as dwarf tapeworm. Current research targets Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, multiple sclerosis and asthma. Helminth infection has emerged as one possible explanation for the low incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies in less developed countries, while reduced infection rates have been linked with the significant and sustained increase in autoimmune diseases seen in industrialized countries.  Incidence of autoimmune diseases and parasitic infestation  While it is recognized that there is probably a genetic disposition in certain individuals for the development of autoimmune diseases, the rate of increase in incidence of autoimmune diseases is not a result of genetic changes in humans; the increased rate of autoimmune-related diseases in the industrialized world is occurring in too short a time to be explained in this way. There is evidence that one of the primary reasons for the increase in autoimmune diseases in industrialized nations is the significant change in environmental factors over the last century. It is posited that the absence of exposure to certain parasites, bacteria, and viruses is playing a significant role in the development of autoimmune diseases in the more sanitized and industrialized Western nations. Lack of exposure to naturally occurring pathogens and parasites may result in an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases. Correlational data has shown the prevalence of helminthic infections to be greatest south of the equator where the rates of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis are low. This is consistent with the hygiene hypothesis which suggests that helminthic infections protect individuals from developing auto-immune diseases rather than being an agent responsible for inducing them. A complete explanation of how environmental factors play a role in autoimmune diseases has still not been proposed. Epidemiological studies such as the meta-analysis by Leonardi-Bee et al., however, have helped to establish the link between parasitic infestation and their protective role in autoimmune disease development.  Hypotheses  Although the mechanism(s) of autoimmune disease development is(are) not fully understood, there is broad agreement that the majority of autoimmune diseases are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to innocuous antigens; these are generally called the hygiene hypothesis, but exist in several variants. One version proposes that the dysfunction is driven by a branch of the immune system known as the T helper cells (T or TH). Two other refinements to the hygiene hypothesis exist: The \\"old friends\\" hypothesis, and the \\"microbiome depletion\\" hypothesis. =TH1 vs. TH2 response regulation= Extra-cellular antigens primarily trigger the TH2 response, as observed with allergies, while intracellular antigens trigger a TH1 response. T cells can be divided into subtypes based on the characteristic cytokines they secrete. TH2 immune responses result in the release of cytokines associated with inflammation reduction such as interleukin 4, interleukin 5, and interleukin 10. These cytokines are thought to reduce the symptoms of many autoimmune disorders. Conversely, TH1 immune responses are characterized by the cytokines interferon gamma (IFNŒ≥) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFŒ±), both of which are thought to increase inflammation and worsen the progression of autoimmune diseases and their symptoms. The antagonism between these two types of immune response is a central theme of one proposal for the biological basis of the hygiene hypothesis, which suggests that there is a regulatory action between the two types of response. The observation that allergies and autoimmune response are increasing at a similar rate in industrialized nations appears to undermine this explanation of hygiene hypothesis. =Learned appropriate response = The hygiene hypothesis proposes that appropriate immune response is in part learned by exposure to micro-organisms and parasites, and in part regulated by their presence. In industrialized nations, humans are exposed to somewhat lower levels of these organisms, potentially resulting in unbalanced immune systems. The development of vaccines, hygienic practices, and effective medical care have diminished or eliminated the prevalence and impact of many parasitic organisms, as well as bacterial and viral infections. This has been of obvious benefit with the effective eradication of many diseases that have plagued human beings. However, while many severe diseases have been eradicated, humans' exposure to benign and apparently beneficial parasites has also been reduced commensurately. The central thrust of the hypothesis is, therefore, that correct development of regulatory T cells in individuals may depend on exposure to organisms such as lactobacilli, various mycobacteria, and helminths. Lack of exposure to sufficient benign antigens, particularly during childhood, is sometimes suggested as a cause of the increase in autoimmune diseases and diseases for which chronic inflammation is a major component in the industrialized world. =Old friends hypothesis= The old friends hypothesis modifies the hygiene hypothesis by proposing that regulatory T cells can only become fully effective if they are stimulated by exposure to microorganisms and parasites that have low levels of pathogenicity and that have coexisted universally with human beings throughout our evolutionary history. This hypothesis has recently been given more credibility by a study demonstrating the impact of infectious organisms, and helminths in particular, upon genes responsible for the production of various cytokines, some involved in the regulation of inflammation, in particular those associated with the development of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease. =Microbiome depletion hypothesis= The microbiome depletion hypothesis posits that the absence of an entire class of organisms from the human inner ecology is a profound evolutionary mismatch that destabilizes the immune system, resulting in disease: The microbiome is \\"depleted\\". The way to correct the dysregulation is to \\"reconstitute\\", or replenish, keystone species in healthy individuals prior to the development of human diseases of modern living. As keystone organisms, helminths are central to correcting immune dysregulation, and their replenishment may prevent disease. The biome depletion hypothesis departs from a drug model approach, which remains the current focus of helminthic therapy as evidenced by numerous clinical trials now underway for existing disease states.  Proposed mechanism of action  Experimental data support the hypothesis that clinically induced helminthic infections have the ability to alleviate or mitigate immune responses. Most autoimmune disorders are believed to involve hyperactive TH1 or TH17 immune responses that are down-regulated by the promotion of a TH2 response by helminths. Helminths secrete immunoregulatory molecules that promote the induction of regulatory T cells while inhibiting the function of antigen presenting cells and other T cells. As such, helminthic therapy attempts to restore homeostasis by shifting a hyperactive TH1 pro-inflammatory response to a TH2 response with reduced inflammation. Human and animal studies have provided evidence of decreased TH1 and TH17 immune responses with a shift to TH2 cytokine production resulting in significantly decreased levels of interleukin 12 and IFNy with simultaneous increases in the regulatory T cells, interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and interleukin 10 of test subjects. These observations indicate that helminth therapy can provide protection against autoimmune disease not only through prevention, since helminths can be present before autoimmune disease develops, but also after autoimmune responses are initiated. Furthermore, responses of type-2 T helper cells rarely kill the parasitic worms. Rather, the TH2 response limits the infection by reducing the viability and reproductive capacity of the parasite. Given the down regulation of TH1 and TH17 immune responses with helminthic therapy, immune responses to other pathogens and allergens may be suppressed. Consequently, unmonitored and uncontrolled helminthic infections may be associated with suppressed immunity to the viruses and bacteria that normally trigger TH1 and TH17 immune responses required for protection against them, leading to illness or disease.  Research  Evidence in support of the idea that helminthic infections reduce the severity of autoimmune diseases is primarily derived from animal models. Studies conducted on mice and rat models of colitis, muscular sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and asthma have shown helminth-infected subjects to display protection from the disease. The first clinical studies of helminthic therapy in humans started about 10‚Äì15 years ago with the use of Trichirus suis. While helminths are often considered a homogenous group, considerable differences exist between species and the species used in clinical research varies between human and animal trials. As such, caution must be exercised when interpreting the results from animal models. Helminthic therapy is currently being studied as a treatment for several (non-viral) autoimmune diseases in humans including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, and atherosclerosis. It is currently unknown which clinical dose or species of helminth is the most effective method of treatment. Hookworms have been linked to reduced risk of developing asthma, while Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm infection) was associated with an increased risk of asthma. Similarly, Hymenolepis nana, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis, Enterobius vermicularis, and Trichuris suis ova have all been found to lower the number of symptom exacerbations, reduce the number of symptom relapses, and decrease the number of new or enlarging brain lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis at doses ranging from 1,180 to 9,340 eggs per gram. However, Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis and Enterobius vermicularis are not considered suitable for therapeutic use in humans because they do not meet the criteria for a therapeutic helminth. Trichuris suis ova has been used in most cases to treat autoimmune disorders because it is thought to be non-pathogenic in humans and therefore has been presumed safe. The use of Trichuris suis ova has been granted by the USA Food and Drug Administration as an investigational medicinal product (IMP). It begins when the eggs are ingested. The worms then colonize the caecum and colon of the human gut for a short period of time. The beneficial effect is temporary because the worms only live for a few weeks. Because of this short life span, treatments need to be repeated at intervals. Trichirus suis removes any wider public health issues due to species- specificity and lack of chronic infection. The hookworm Necator americanus has been granted an IMP license by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority in the U.K. Necator americanus larvae are administered percutaneously and migrate through the vasculature and lungs to the small intestine. They feed on the blood from the mucosa. This hookworm is likely to be relatively safe, although it can cause temporary gastrointestinal side effects, especially following the initial inoculation, or with increased doses. High doses can also cause anemia. The general ideal characteristics for a therapeutic helminth are as follows: * Little or no pathogenic potential * Does not multiply in the host * Cannot be directly spread to close contacts * Produces a self-limited colonization in humans * Produces an asymptomatic colonization in humans * Does not alter behaviour in patients with depressed immunity * Is not affected by most commonly-used medications * Can be eradicated with an anti-helminthic drug * Can be isolated free of other potential pathogens * Can be isolated or produced in large numbers * Can be made stable for transport and storage * Easy to administer  Potential side effects  Helminths are extremely successful parasites capable of establishing long-lasting infections within a host. During this time, helminths compete with the host organism's cells for nutrient resources and thus possess the potential to cause harm. However, the number of organisms hosted by individuals undergoing helminthic therapy is very small and any side effects are typically only encountered in the first three months of infection. In the long term, the vast majority of clinically infected individuals are asymptomatic, with no significant nutrient loss. In fact, nutrient uptake can be enhanced in some subjects who are hosting a small number of helminths. If the side effects from helminthic therapy were to become unmanageable, they can be alleviated by the use of anti-helminthic medications. The most common clinical symptoms which may be encountered while undergoing helminthic therapy can include: * Fatigue * Gastrointestinal discomfort * Anemia * Fever * Abdominal pain * Weight loss * Anorexia * Diarrhea * General malaise  See also  * Antihelminthics * Diseases of affluence * Effects of parasitic worms on the immune system * Gut flora * Ichthyotherapy * Malariotherapy * Medical leech * Trematodes  References   Bibliography   External links  * Helminthic Therapy Wiki Allergology Biologically-based therapies Nematodes and humans Helminthology ","title":"Helminthic therapy"},{"id":"2846351","text":"Alan Sparhawk (born 1969) is an American musician and singer-songwriter.

He met Mimi Parker when he was 9, after his family moved to Minnesota. Sparhawk began writing his own compositions at an early age. He later married Parker and eventually began performing with her in the band Low in Duluth, Minnesota in 1993. Low released their first album in 1994. As of 2015, Low has released eleven full-length studio albums. As of 2010, the group is composed of founding members Sparhawk (guitar and vocals) and Mimi Parker (drums and vocals), joined by newer addition Steve Garrington (bass guitar).Interview with Alan Sparhawk, Duluth News Tribune, March 6, 2008. The music of Low is characterized by slow tempos and minimalist arrangements. Early descriptions sometimes referred to it as rock subgenre called \\"slowcore\\". However, Low's members ultimately disapproved of the term.Sparhawk: \\"What's the cheesiest? Slow-core. I hate that word. The most appropriate is anything that uses the word minimal in it, but I don't think anybody's made one up for that.\\"QRD magazine interviewIn another interview, Sparhawk claimed that a friend coined the term: \\"this friend of ours in a record store was always joking around ... and he said, 'I got it! You should call it \\"slowcore\\"!' ... It was a total joke, and I think I mentioned it at one of our interviews.\\" \\"Interview with Low\\", Chord magazine, Jess Hemerly, April 2007, p. 44. Parker and Sparhawk's striking vocal harmonies represent perhaps the group's most distinctive element; critic Denise Sullivan writes that their shared vocals are \\"as chilling as anything Gram and Emmylou ever conspired on‚Äîthough that's not to say it's country- tinged, just straight from the heart.\\" Sparhawk is also a member of the blues- roots band Black Eyed Snakes, the blues-dub jam band Los Besos, and the rock band Retribution Gospel Choir. He also occasionally plays solo shows in his hometown. As a solo artist, Sparhawk released his debut album entitled Solo Guitar in August, 2006. He also released a track on a various artists compilation, Songs for the End of the World, as Hollis M. Sparhawk & Her Father, and the track \\"Be Nice To People With Lice\\" on the various artists compilation album See You on the Moon!. In 2007 he did a Take-Away Show acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon. Sparhawk has done charity work with the Maasai tribe in Kenya. After a friend of his became a friend of the village of Namuncha, he played a Christmas show in order to raise funds to build a school there, where students had previously been meeting in the shade outside. He calls the experience of visiting the Maasai one of the most spiritual of his life. Alan and Mimi live in Duluth, Minnesota, with their two children.

What are said to be the remains of Saint Agnes are below the high altar. The church is built over the Catacombs of Saint Agnes, where the saint was originally buried, and which may still be visited from the church. A large basilica with the same name was built nearby in the 4th century and its ruins can be seen near Santa Costanza, in the same site. The existing church was built by Pope Honorius I in the 7th century, and largely retains its original structure, despite many changes to the decoration. In particular the mosaic in the apse of Agnes, Honorius, and another Pope is largely in its original condition. The current Cardinal Priest of the Titulus S. Agnetis Extra moenia is Camillo Ruini. History A very large basilica was built some metres from the present church in the 4th century, to which was attached the large private mausoleum for Constantina, the daughter of Constantine I. The mausoleum was later converted into a church, which survives and is now known as Santa Costanza (she was venerated as a saint, even though she was not one officially). It contains very important 4th century mosaics, especially large areas of ceiling in a secular style, but also two small apse mosaics, one including an early depiction of Jesus in what has become the standard style of long fair hair and a halo. The large basilica decayed during the decline of Rome, and was replaced in the 7th century by the present much smaller church, commissioned by Pope Honorius I. The lower part of the walls from about half of one side of the Constantinian basilica, and its apse, can still be seen. The new church was over what was believed to be Agnes's grave. The floor level of the 7th-century church is some two metres above the level of the catacomb floor, and the public street entrances are at the level of the 2nd floor gallery. A long wide internal set of steps, lined with inscriptions from the catacombs and other ancient buildings set into the walls, leads down from the street level to the floor level of the church. The apse mosaic from Honorius's time is still present, and less affected by restoration than most mosaics of this date. On a gold ground, a central standing figure of Agnes in the costume of a Byzantine empress is flanked by Honorius, offering a model of the building, and another pope, whose identity is uncertain. The church was also built with a separate upper gallery for women (matronaeum), similar to that of San Lorenzo fuori le mura. Saint Emerentiana was also buried here. The catacombs are on three levels, dating from the 2nd to the 5th centuries; part of the highest level dating to the 2nd century can be visited by a guided tour. Though no paintings remain in place, there are a number of inscriptions and engraved images of interest. Many more inscriptions line the large staircase leading from the main convent above to the church. It is in this church that on the feast day of St. Agnes (January 21), two lambs are specially blessed, usually by the pope after a pontifical high Mass; their wool is later woven into pallia, ceremonial neck-stoles sent by the popes to newly elevated Metropolitan- archbishops to symbolise their union with the papacy. The church was assigned to the Canons Regular of the Lateran by Pope Innocent VIII in 1489; and they continued to serve it after Pope Clement XI made it a parish church by Pope Clement XI in 1708.

The gate has been separated from the Aurelian Walls, and looks like a castle, with the two towers and the double entrance. It is, therefore, sometimes called \\"Castelletto\\". The Porta San Paolo (San Paolo Gate) is one of the southern gates in the 3rd-century Aurelian Walls of Rome, Italy. The Via Ostiense Museum (') is housed within the gatehouse.https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome/attractions/porta-san- paolo/a/poi-sig/1592665/359975 It is in the Ostiense quarter; just to the west is the Roman Pyramid of Cestius, an Egyptian-style pyramid, and beyond that is the Protestant Cemetery.  History  The original name of the gate was ', because it was located at the beginning of via Ostiense, the road that connected Rome and Ostia. Via Ostiense was an important arterial road, as evidenced by the fact that upon entering the gate of the same name, the road split, with one direction leading to the famous Emporium, the great market of Rome. The gatehouse is flanked by two cylindrical towers, and has two entrances, which had been covered by a second, single-opening gate, built in front of the first by the Byzantine general Belisarius (530s‚Äì540s). The structure is due to Maxentius, in the 4th century, but the two towers were heightened by Honorius. Its original ‚Äî Latin ‚Äî name was ', since it opened on the way to Ostia. Later, it was renamed to the Italian ', because it was the exit of Rome that led to the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls. In 549, Rome was under siege; the Ostrogoths of Totila entered through this gate, because of the treason of the Isaurian garrison. On 10 September 1943, two days after the armistice between the Allies and Italy had been agreed, Italian military and civil forces tried to block German seizure of the city, with 570 casualties.

He is also a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional and was named one of Microsoft's seven Windows Pioneers. Biography He graduated with a Master of Science in Mathematics from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1975. Aside from writing books about Windows programming he has contributed to various magazines about computers. He had an interest in electronic music and in 1977 started building electronic music instruments out of CMOS chips. In 1979, Petzold started building a computer-controlled digital electronic music synthesizer based on the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. This experience of digital circuitry and assembly language programming formed the basis of his book Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software. Petzold purchased a two-diskette IBM PC in 1984 for $5,000. This debt encouraged him to use the PC to earn some revenue so he wrote an article about ANSI.SYS and the PROMPT command. This was submitted to PC Magazine for which they paid $800. This was the beginning of Petzold's career as a paid writer. In 1984, PC Magazine decided to do a review of printers. They asked all current New York contributors to help with the review. Petzold showed the staff some small assembly-language programs he had written. Soon he was busy writing little 300-500 byte .COM file utilities for PC Magazine. Petzold was soon getting so much freelance work from PC Magazine that he was able to quit his job. Microsoft then decided that Microsoft Systems Journal would cover both DOS and Windows programming. Jonathan Lazarus, who contracted with Microsoft, recruited Petzold to write some articles. Petzold wrote the article A Step-by-Step Guide to Building Your First Windows Application\\" for MSJ, Vol.1, No. 2 (December 1986) which he believes was the first article about Windows programming to appear in a magazine. Petzold told some people at a Microsoft-related function that he really enjoyed writing this type of article. This news was relayed to Microsoft Press editor-in-chief Susan Lammers. This resulted in Petzold being contracted to write the first edition of Programming Windows from January until August 1987.

It is a parameter used in sociology, psychology, and other psychometric or behavioral sciences. Concurrent validity is demonstrated when a test correlates well with a measure that has previously been validated. The two measures may be for the same construct, but more often used for different, but presumably related, constructs. The two measures in the study are taken at the same time. This is in contrast to predictive validity, where one measure occurs earlier and is meant to predict some later measure.McIntire, S.A. and Miller, L.A., Foundations of Psychological Testing,2nd Edition, Sage Publishing Co., 2005. In both cases, the (concurrent) predictive power of the test is analyzed using a simple correlation or linear regression. Alignment with classical conceptions of validity  Concurrent validity and predictive validity are two types of criterion-related validity. The difference between concurrent validity and predictive validity rests solely on the time at which the two measures are administered. Concurrent validity applies to validation studies in which the two measures are administered at approximately the same time. For example, an employment test may be administered to a group of workers and then the test scores can be correlated with the ratings of the workers' supervisors taken on the same day or in the same week. The resulting correlation would be a concurrent validity coefficient. This type of evidence might be used to support the use of the employment test for future selection of employees. Concurrent validity may be used as a practical substitute for predictive validity. In the example above, predictive validity would be the best choice for validating an employment test, because using the employment test on existing employees may not be a strong analog for using the tests for selection. Reduced motivation and restriction of range are just two possible biasing effects for concurrent validity studies. Contrasting similar terms Concurrent validity differs from convergent validity in that it focuses on the power of the focal test to predict outcomes on another test or some outcome variable. Convergent validity refers to the observation of strong correlations between two tests that are assumed to measure the same construct. It is the interpretation of the focal test as a predictor that differentiates this type of evidence from convergent validity, though both methods rely on simple correlations in the statistical analysis.

A native of Turin, he was one of Italy's top racing drivers of the 1920s. Bordino won the 1922 Italian Grand Prix and also raced in the 1925 Indianapolis 500, finishing 10th. He died in 1928 during practice for a race at Alessandria after he hit a dog, causing his car to overturn and land in a river, drowning him. Sir Henry Segrave described him as ‚Äúthe finest road race driver in the world.‚Äù Georgano 1971, p.174-5 He was renowned for his speed and courage, although his race successes did not necessarily meet that promise. Racing career Pietro Bordino was born on 22nd November, 1887 in Turin, His father got work as a caretaker at the new FIAT factory. Montagna 1989, p.226 In 1904, as a 17-year old he started his racing career as a riding mechanic with Vincenzo Lancia and Felice Nazzaro. He accompanied Lancia in the 1905 Gordon Bennett Cup, finishing second, and they were second to Nazzaro in the 1907 Targa Florio. Fondi 2006, p.49 In 1908, he again accompanied Lancia in the FIAT works team at the French Grand Prix at Dieppe, where they retired, and the Coppa Florio, where they came fifth and Nazzaro won. Fondi 2006, p.328 In the same year he got to drive a FIAT for himself, winning the French hill-climb at Ch√¢teau-Thierry. Rendall 1993, p.96-7 Again in 1910, he won his class in the Modena speed-trial for FIAT, which was also the final race for Vincenzo Lancia. Montagna 1989, p.17 He continued with speed record attempts the next year, driving a FIAT using a 300 bhp engine of an airship at Brooklands and the Saltburn sands. The 1913 Targa Florio was a 2-day lap of Sicily and for the first time he broke away from FIAT to drive one of his former team-mate's own cars. After nearly fourteen hours driving, he brought his Lancia home in third. Fondi 2006, p.331 Bordino returned to Sicily after the Great War for the twelfth Targa Florio in 1921. Driving a 3-litre Fiat 801 he retired on the second lap. Fondi 2006, p.337 Later in the year, he drove for Fiat in the first Italian Grand Prix, held near Brescia. Taking the lead from the start, he set the early pace, including the fastest lap of the race of over 150 mph, until forced to retired with a broken oil-pump. Montagna 1989, p.20 Ineligible for the new 2-litre formula coming in the next year, Bordino and his Fiat 801 were taken across the Atlantic to race in America. Ludvigsen 2008, p.33 In six starts, at the beginning of the season, he won two short, sprint races on wooden-board ovals at Beverly Hills and Santa Rosa in California. In 1922, the new Italian racing circuit was opened at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza. Bordino and Nazzaro completed the first test laps on July 28 in a Fiat 501, with construction completed in a remarkable 100 days. In September, Bordino won the inaugural race, for sports cars, in a Fiat. He won the Italian Voiturette Grand Prix in a Fiat 502 ‚Äì a new 1.5-litre design using half the engine of the 801. Ludvigsen 2008, p.34 For the second Italian Grand Prix, at Monza a few days later, despite heavy rain 100000 spectators turned out (arriving in almost 25% of Italy‚Äôs complete automobile fleet of 41000 cars at the time). Fiat had introduced their new 804 model for the 2-litre formula, and were the strong favourites on their home track. They had dominated the recent, blue riband French Grand Prix, won by Nazzaro. In that race the suspension of Bordino's Fiat had collapsed while he was leading, fortunately without significant injury. But an almost identical accident earlier in the race had killed Nazzaro's nephew. The race was diminished, as most of the other works teams had cancelled their attendance. From a promising 38 entries, only six started, including Bordino, Nazzaro and Enrico Giaccone for Fiat. Once again, Bordino took the lead from the start. By the 50th of 80 laps there were only three cars left running, and Bordino could ease off to take a comfortable victory from Nazzaro. Montagna 1989, p.24 Overnight, Bordino became a national celebrity, and his hard-driving style in the red Fiats earned him the nickname of Diavolo Rosso (Red devil). Rendall 1993, p.98-9 In the 1923 Grand Prix, Fiat had its ground-breaking, supercharged Tipo 805. Earlier in practice, Bordino and teammate Giaccone had been out testing together when the suspension on their Fiat broke, throwing them off the track. Giaccone died of his wounds later in hospital, while Bordino injured his neck and dislocated his shoulder (or broke his wrist). Rendall 1993, p.104-5 He drove the race with his arm in a sling, and his riding mechanic helping to change gears. Montagna 1989, p.26-8 He set the fastest lap before retiring from the excessive pain. Fellow Fiat team-member, Carlo Salomano, took victory, the first Grand Prix win for a supercharged car. Ludvigsen 2008, p.37 The 1924 Targa Florio was to be a race between the Alfa Romeo and Mercedes works teams. Fiat entered Bordino in a smaller, 1.5-litre supercharged 501SS model. Despite giving away a power advantage, his consistency gave him third place and winning his class. The Fiats were outmatched at the French Grand Prix by the new Alfa Romeos. Though Bordino duelled for the lead with Antonio Ascari's Alfa Romeo initially, his brakes soon faded. Victory went to Giuseppe Campari's Alfa. Rendall 1993, p.108 In 1925, Bordino took a Fiat 805 across to America to run in the Indianapolis 500. Adapted into a single-seater, he ran several races in the lead-up without great success. In the main race itself he qualified eighth on the grid. He had to stop early in the race to change spark-plugs that cost him two laps. He then injured his hand during a pit- stop. His relief driver, Frenchman Antoine Mourne, took over and brought the Fiat home to finish tenth. Pietro Bordino and the Fiat 806 at the 1927 Milan GP Fiat had retired its works team for several years, but in 1927 surprised the racing world with the powerful new Tipo 806, and its V12 supercharged 1.5-litre engine. Too new to endure the four-hour Italian Grand Prix, the team gave the prototype to Bordino to race in the Milan Grand Prix supporting race at the same meeting. Despite heavy rain, he dominated the race and easily won the car's first and only race. Rendall 1993, p.120 When Fiat chose to stop its racing program for good, Bordino bought a new Bugatti Type 35B to race in the 1928 Italian Driver's Championship. The third round at the end of March, the Circuito del Pozzo, was one of the fastest tracks, but the heavy rain made driving conditions very difficult. Bordino led at the start, but after getting a puncture and falling two laps behind, he retired. The next weekend, he competed in the second Mille Miglia in a Bugatti Type 43 tourer. The 1000-mile race went from Brescia to Rome and back. The race was won by the veteran Campari in an Alfa Romeo, while Bordino finished two hours behind in sixteenth, after over 21 hours racing. A fortnight later was the Circuito di Alessandria, next race in the Italian Championship. Bordino took the opportunity in the intervening weekend for some race testing. He had been offered a works drive by Bugatti for that race and the following Targa Florio. He was just completing a lap, coming back into the city when a dog ran into the street in front of the car. Hitting the animal at 70 km/h, the suspension and steering were wrecked. Despite his best efforts, Bordino lost control as the car spun off the road, got airborne and tumbled down the roadside cliff to the Tanaro River. Bordino was thrown from the car and found dead a few hundred metres downstream. His mechanic, Giovanni (or Pietro) Lasagna, was crushed by the car and critically injured but eventually recovered. In commemoration, the race would be thereafter renamed the Circuito Pietro Bordino. Pietro Bordino was buried in the Cimitero Monumentale di Torino.

It faces onto the Piazza Navona, one of the main urban spaces in the historic centre of the city and the site where the Early Christian Saint Agnes was martyred in the ancient Stadium of Domitian. Construction began in 1652 under the architects Girolamo Rainaldi and his son Carlo Rainaldi. After numerous quarrels, the other main architect involved was Francesco Borromini.For the building history of the church and extensive documentation, see Gerhard Eimer, La Fabbrica di S. Agnese in Navona, Stockholm 1970 The church is a titular deaconry, with Gerhard Ludwig M√ºller being the current Cardinal-Deacon. As well as religious services, the church hosts regular classical concerts in the Borromini Sacristy, from sacred Baroque works to chamber music and operas.  History View into frescoed cupola and pendentives; apse on left, entrance with organ and tomb of Pope Innocent X on right The building of the church was begun in 1652 at the instigation of Pope Innocent X whose family palace, the Palazzo Pamphili, is adjacent to this church. The church was to be effectively a family chapel annexed to their residence (for example, an opening was formed in the drum of the dome so the family could participate in the religious services from their palace).The Doria-Pamphili family own the church to this day. The first designs for a centralised Greek Cross church were prepared by the Pamphili family architect, Girolamo Rainaldi, and his son Carlo Rainaldi in 1652. They reorientated the main entrance to the church from the Via Santa Maria dell‚ÄôAnima, a street set one urban block away from the piazza, to the Piazza Navona, a large urban space that Innocent was transforming into a showcase associated with his family. It had been the intention to build the new church over the old church which would become the crypt; this meant the new church was to be raised well above piazza level, but this idea was abandoned once construction started. The original drawings are lost but it is thought that the Piazza Navona facade design included a narthex between two towers and broad stairs descending to the piazza.Magnuson T. Rome in the Age of Bernini, Stockholm, 1986, Vol 2, 56 Harsh criticism was made of the design, including the steps down to the piazza which were thought to project excessively, so Carlo Rainaldi eliminated the narthex idea and substituted a concave facade so that the steps would not be so intrusive.Magnuson, 1986, v2, 60 The idea of the twin towers framing a central dome may be indebted to Bernini's bell towers on the facade of Saint Peter's basilica. Nonetheless, Rainaldi's design of a concave facade and a central dome framed by twin towers was influential on subsequent church design in Northern Europe.Magnuson, 1986, v2, 61. In 1653, the Rainaldis were replaced by Borromini. Borromini had to work with the Rainaldi ground plan but made adjustments; on the interior for instance, he positioned columns towards the edges of the dome piers which had the effect of creating a broad base to the dome pendentives instead of the pointed base which was the usual Roman solution.Blunt, A. Borromini, Harvard University Press, 157 His drawings show that on the fa√ßade to Piazza Navona, he designed curved steps descending to the piazza, the convex curvature of which play against the concave curvature of the fa√ßade to form an oval landing in front of the main entrance. His fa√ßade was to have eight columns and a broken pediment over the entrance. He designed the flanking towers as single storey, above which there was to be a complex arrangement of columns and convex bays with balustrades. By the time of Innocent's death in 1655, the fa√ßade had reached the top of the lower order. Innocent's nephew, Camillo Pamphili, failed to take interest in the church and Borromini became disheartened, eventually leading to his resignation in 1657. Carlo Rainaldi was reappointed and made a number of modifications to Borromini's design including an additional storey to the flanking towers and simplifying their uppermost parts. On the death of Camillo, his wife Olympia (Aldobrandini), commissioned Bernini to take over. He was responsible for the straightforward pediment above the main entrance and for the emphatic entablature in the interior. In 1668, Olympia's son, Camillo, took over responsibility for the church. He reinstated Carlo Rainaldi as architect and engaged Ciro Ferri to create frescoes for the interior of the dome. Further decorations were added; there were large scale sculptures and polychrome marble effects. None of these are likely to have been intended by Borromini. Interior Skull of Saint Agnes Main altar with the relief of The Holy Family by Domenico Guidi The cupola is frescoed with the Apotheosis of St Agnes, begun in 1670 by Ciro Ferri and finished after his death in 1689 by Sebastiano Corbellini. The pendentives of the dome were painted with the Cardinal Virtues (1662-1672) by Bernini's prot√©g√©, Giovanni Battista Gaulli. In the sacristy, there is a painting depicting the Glory of St Agnese by Paolo Gismondi. The near-circular interior, actually a Greek cross design, is circumferentially surrounded by marble sculptural Baroque masterpieces, dedicated to individual martyred saints. There are four altars in the pillars with reliefs, unusually set in semi-circular niches. Among the sculptural decoration are the following: *The Two Holy Families (1676) by Domenico Guidi - The main altar initially was intended to hold a Miracle of Saint Agnes commissioned from Alessandro Algardi, but who died shortly after receiving the commission. Algardi provided a small model while a full scale plaster model (now in the Oratorio dei Filippini) was made by his assistants Ercole Ferrata and Guidi., cat. no. 45. For some reason the project for the Miracle ensemble was dropped, and instead Guidi created a marble relief, depicting The Holy Family according to his design. *Death of Saint Alexius by Giovanni Francesco Rossi is the relief above the first altar on the right. *Martyrdom of Saint Emerentiana by Ercole Ferrata, with the upper portion completed by Leonardo Reti is on the second altar on the right. *Martyrdom of Saint Eustace by Melchiorre Caf√† is on the first altar on the left. Due to Caf√†'s sudden early death large parts of the relief were completed by his master, Ferrata, and his workshop. *Death of Saint Cecilia by Antonio Raggi is on the second altar on the left. *Saint Agnes on the Pyre by Ercole Ferrata is in the second altar of the transept on the right is the *On the second altar of the transept on the left is the St Sebastian (c.1717-1719) with a statue by Pier Paolo Campi, and also boasts two marble angels by his master Pierre Le Gros which might well be Le Gros' very last works.Gerhard Bissell, Pierre Le Gros 1666-1719, Reading (Si Vede) 1997, pp. 121-122. The statues of Saint Agnes and of Saint Sebastian are placed in an illusionistic architecture of colored marble. *Tomb Monument of Pope Innocent X (1729) by Giovanni Battista Maini - The monument originally planned on a grand scale, but was executed placed above the main entrance in a far more modest monument. *The stucco decorations in the niches' semi-domes with angels presenting the symbols of the respective saint are by Ferrata's workshop. Inside the church is also a shrine for Saint Agnes, containing her skull and a marble relief by Alessandro Algardi. Origin of name and legends The name of this church is unrelated to the ‚Äòagony‚Äô of the martyr: in agone was the ancient name of Piazza Navona (piazza in agone), and meant instead, from the Greek, ‚Äòin the site of the competitions‚Äô, because Piazza Navona was built on the site of an ancient Roman stadium of the Greek model, with one flat end, and was used for footraces. From ‚Äòin agone‚Äô, the popular use and pronunciation changed the name into ‚ÄòNavona‚Äô, but other roads in the area kept the original name.As, for example, the Corsia Agonale, a short road that connects the piazza with the Palazzo Madama. Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers is situated in front of the church. It is often said that Bernini sculpted the figure of the \\"Nile\\" covering his eyes as if he thought the facade designed by his rival Borromini could crumble atop him. This story, like many urban legends, persists because it has a ring of authenticity, despite the fact that Bernini's fountain predates the facade by some years. Borromini and Bernini became rivals, and more, for architectural commissions. Most prominently, during the Pamphili papacy, an official commission was established to study defects that had arisen in the foundations of the belltowers (built under Bernini's guidance) in the facade of Saint Peter's Basilica. In testimony before the commission, Borromini was one of many harsh critics that assailed the project's engineering. Ultimately, in a severe blow to Bernini's prestige as an architect, the facade bell-towers were torn down, and never rebuilt. =Cardinal-Deacons= *Lorenzo Cardinal Antonetti 1998-2013 *Gerhard Ludwig Cardinal M√ºller 2014-present Gallery File:Parione - s Agnese in Agone interno 1020592.JPGView towards the main altar File:SantAgneseAgone-Cupola01-SteO153.JPGCupola with Frescos by Ferri File:St Agnese in Agone Rome interior 01.jpgThe Death of Saint Alexius by Rossi File:St Agnese in Agone Rome interior 05.jpgThe Death of Saint Cecilia by Raggi File:Sant'agnese in agone, interno 09.JPGThe Martyrdom of Saint Eustace by Caf√† File:Sant'agnese in agone, interno 06.JPGThe Martyrdom of Saint Emerentiana by Ferrata File:St Agnese in Agone Rome interior 02.jpgSaint Agnes on the Pyre by Ferrata File:St Agnese in Agone Rome interior 06.jpgStatue of Saint Sebastian by Campi and Angels by Le Gros File:SantAgneseAgone-InnocenzoX-SteO153.JPGTomb of Innocent X by Maini File:Shrine Saint Agnes.JPGShrine of Saint Agnes See also *Palazzo Pamphilj References External links * Official Website * \\"Sant'Agnese in Agone\\", by Nyborg. *High-resolution 360¬∞ Panoramas and Images of Sant'Agnese in Agone  Art Atlas Roman Catholic churches completed in 1657 Agnese Agone Baroque architecture in Rome Burial places of popes Catholic congregations established in the 17th century 1657 establishments in Italy Churches of Rome (rione Parione) Church buildings with domes ","title":"Sant'Agnese in Agone"},{"id":"2846386","text":"The Waterside Meadery, Penzance A meadery is a winery that produces honey wines or meads.

Both horses were later voted into the American Hall of Fame. The victory deprived Sunday Silence of the Triple Crown. It was also the second-fastest Belmont in history, behind only the record performance of Secretariat in 1973. Easy Goer was the first two- year-old champion to win a Triple Crown race since Spectacular Bid in 1979. Easy Goer also ran the fastest mile on dirt by any three-year-old in the history of Thoroughbred racing with a time of 1:32 2/5, which was a second faster than Secretariat's stakes record, and one-fifth of a second off of the world record set by Dr. Fager in 1968. Easy Goer is the only horse in racing history to win the Belmont, Whitney, Travers, Woodward and Jockey Club Gold Cup and the only 3-year-old to win the Whitney, Woodward and Jockey Club Gold Cup while defeating older horses in the latter three. Easy Goer is one of only two horses to win the Champagne, Belmont, and Travers. He is also one of only two horses to notch a Belmont Stakes, Whitney and Travers triple, and the only one to do so in the same year. Additionally, he is one of only five horses to tally a Whitney-Travers double in the same year. Since 1919, Easy Goer is one of only ten horses to sweep the Belmont, Travers and Jockey Club Gold Cup. Since 1973, Easy Goer is one of only eight horses that have won three consecutive Grade I races longer than 1 1/8 miles on dirt (or synthetic). On the Blood-Horse List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, Easy Goer is ranked #34. Racing career Bred and owned by Ogden Phipps, Easy Goer was a son of Alydar out of the 1981 American Champion Older Female Horse Relaxing (by Buckpasser). Trained by Shug McGaughey and ridden by Pat Day, the uncommonly muscular, big, powerful, long-striding chestnut colt with a white star won 14 of his 20 races, including nine Grade I wins at distances of seven furlongs, eight furlongs, nine furlongs, ten furlongs and twelve furlongs, and placed second five times. Easy Goer's racing career was also marked by his closely matched rivalry with Sunday Silence, who held a three to one edge in their head to head races. Easy Goer defeated Sunday Silence by eight lengths in the Belmont and finished second to him in the Kentucky Derby by two and a half lengths, Preakness by a nose and Breeders' Cup Classic by a neck. Both horses were later voted into the American Hall of Fame. McGaughey described Easy Goer as, \\"a big, strong horse, and jockey Pat Day helped him by not crucifying him in his races and bringing me back something. He had soundness problems, but we stayed on top of it. His action was so athletic, so natural, so fluid; he glided over the track; he ran very fast and did it so easily. He captured the public; he was a brilliantly fast horse, exciting to watch, and he had a great following. I had always dreamed of having a horse like Easy Goer. Easy Goer is by far the best that I've ever had.\\" Day stated, \\"Easy Goer was the best horse I ever rode. He was the most talented and he had a big engine and a lot of heart and desire. He did what he did with continuing ailments.\\" Racing writer Steve Haskin described Easy Goer as \\"Adonis-like, the closest thing physically to Secretariat. He was plagued by terrible ankles his entire career, but was placed upon a throne at an early age and justified all the adoration. Easy Goer was a horse with God-given talent who appeared to have everything ‚Äì looks, class, pedigree, speed, and stamina.\\" Racing writer Edward L. Bowen said: \\"Easy Goer was a glowing chestnut with a fluid stride that belied his short pasterns and less than perfect foot. Pasterns notwithstanding, he had the look of greatness, and he ran to his looks. He was a horse who tempted horsemen and fans to slip into their thoughts the phrase, 'the most perfect horse you can imagine.' Easy Goer was large but not too large. He was elegant but not dainty. He was powerful but not gross. To the aesthete taking in the whole rather than haggling over the parts, the dictionary simply proved inadequate: Easy Goer was not just perfect, he was \\"damned perfect.\\" Blood-Horse pedigree analyst Avalyn Hunter's assessment of Easy Goer was that \\"Easy Goer combined blistering speed over a mile with thoroughly genuine stamina.\\" Tom LaMarra, of Blood-Horse, wrote: \\"Easy Goer is mentioned in the same breath with some of the greatest horses of all time.\\" Joe Drape of The New York Times described Easy Goer as a \\"powerful, massive, raw talent with an enormous stride.\\" Hall of Fame trainer John Veitch stated, \\"Easy Goer had more weapons and was more versatile than his father Alydar.\\" Bud Delp, trainer of Spectacular Bid, said, \\"I hadn't seen the kind of pistonlike action in a horse since Spectacular Bid. Easy Goer had the same kind of stride, which was effortless.\\" His running style was multifaceted and flexible, and he was able to adjust to racing conditions; he could go to the lead or come from behind, he was able to put pressure on speed horses and stay with a faster pace, or drop back if needed. Among his peak performances, Easy Goer ran 124 and 122 Beyer Speed Figures. Easy Goer also routinely ran in the 120 Beyer Speed Figure range on a regular basis in his races, while arch-rival Sunday Silence did so rarely and only when it was required for him to prevail. It is noteworthy that Easy Goer's overall speed figures were substantially superior to principal rival Sunday Silence, despite Sunday Silence's slight three to one edge in their head-to-head races. Furthermore, Easy Goer ran the fastest Beyer Speed Figure performance by any two-year-old, as well as the fastest Beyer Speed Figure performance in any Triple Crown race since Beyer racing figures were first published. =1988: two-year-old season= Before his career began, Easy Goer was shipped to McGaughey at the Payson Park Training Center in Indiantown, Florida, where he spent the winter getting acquainted with the starting gate and underwent basic training. His trainer noted some faults in his conformation. He had puffy, problematic ankles, a clubfoot, and a turned-out left knee, all providing the potential for injury once the horse began serious workouts. However, McGaughey was captivated with Easy Goer the first time he saw him, but really felt he had something special when he watched him for the first time with a set of horses. \\"He gave the impression he could gallop those horses to death,\\" McGaughey said. At age two, Easy Goer won his maiden race at seven furlongs at Saratoga Race Course under a hand ride in a final time of 1:22 3/5, defeating Is It True by two and a half lengths after being forwardly placed two lengths off the early leaders and having to steady on the backstretch, and, as McGaughey stated, \\"Running two or three seconds faster than the other maiden race run at the same distance that day at Saratoga.\\" Easy Goer's time was notably impressive taking into account that it was approximately fifteen lengths faster than that aforementioned maiden race run at the same distance that day at Saratoga. Easy Goer came out of that race with a sore left shin. McGaughey was concerned because he thought he might have to stop the colt's training; however, treatment by hosing and poulticing the leg to draw out the heat was successful. McGaughey decided to wait and have Easy Goer's legs further treated after the Breeders' Cup that November. Easy Goer continued to train at Saratoga. Three weeks later, he then won a 6 1/2 furlong allowance race by five and a half lengths at Belmont Park, again under little urging, running one-fifth of a second off the track record in 1:15 2/5, while carrying five pounds more than his opponents. Easy Goer's time was particularly exceptional considering that on the same day at Belmont, older allowance horses ran the same distance just under two seconds slower. His trainer said after the race, \\"Then I knew I was training something special.\\" Three weeks after that near- record performance, Easy Goer next won the seven-furlong Grade I Cowdin Stakes with little encouragement, defeating Is It True again by four lengths. Easy Goer was never more than three and a half lengths behind the early leaders, who ran quick early fractions of 22 2/5 and 45 3/5, before drawing away through the stretch. He also defeated Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt Mercedes Won, who was the Hopeful Stakes and Florida Derby winner. He ran the seven furlongs in 1:23 3/5. The final time was more than two seconds off Devil's Bag's 1983 stakes record, but the Belmont track was producing uncommonly slow times that day. Two weeks later Easy Goer won the $557,000 one-mile Grade I Champagne Stakes with little exertion, again defeating Is It True by four lengths, after vying for command and running a half length to a length and a half behind the leader through fast fractions of 22 4/5 and 45 3/5. He also defeated the Belmont Futurity winner Trapp Mountain and Young America Stakes winner Irish Actor. His 1:34 4/5 final time for the mile was three-fifths of a second off the Champagne stakes record, and tied for fourth- fastest in Champagne Stakes history behind Vitriolic, Seattle Slew (1:34 2/5), and Devil's Bag (1:34 1/5). In the Frizette Stakes run at the same distance that day at Belmont, future Hall of Fame champion Open Mind fell a nose short of catching Some Romance at the wire. Some Romance ran the mile in 1:36 4/5, two seconds, or approximately 12 lengths, slower than Easy Goer. Additionally, in this Champagne Stakes, Easy Goer ran the fastest Beyer Speed Figure performance (116 Beyer) of any two-year-old since Beyer racing figures were first published. Racing analyst Andrew Beyer stated, \\"Easy Goer was the most brilliant American two-year-old of the decade.\\" Racing writer Steven Crist stated, \\"Easy Goer is among the fastest two-year-olds of the last two decades.\\" Three weeks after the Champagne Stakes, he finished second by a little more than a length in his last race of his two-year-old season, the Grade 1 Breeders' Cup Juvenile on a muddy track at Churchill Downs. He lost to Is It True, a horse he had defeated three times earlier in the year by a combined ten and a half lengths, having jumped the tire tracks left by the starting gate late in the homestretch, and seemed to be struggling and uncomfortable with the muddy Churchill track. He earned $697,500 and was named Champion two-year-old colt and was the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby. After the Breeders' Cup, he was shipped to New York to have his shins pinfired, and then sent to Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Florida, to recuperate. =1989: three-year-old season= At three, Easy Goer started his year in Florida by winning the Swale Stakes in the fastest seven furlongs of the Gulfstream Park meeting in a time of 1:22 1/5 while carrying ten pounds more than the runner up. He \\"exploded\\" around the far turn to an almost nine length win defeating Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes and Nassau County Stakes winner Tricky Creek. He then won the one mile Grade II Gotham Stakes by thirteen lengths in stakes and track record time while conceding nine pounds and five pounds to the second and third-place finishers respectively, including future world record holder (on turf at one mile) Expensive Decision, winner of the Kelso Handicap and Saranac Handicap. He ran within one to two lengths of the leaders throughout the race, who were running a very rapid pace of 44 1/5 and 1:08 3/5, before running past them and widening away. He won handily and his winning time of 1:32 2/5 for the mile set a new track record, a second faster than Secretariat's stakes record, the fastest mile on a dirt surface by any three-year-old Thoroughbred in history, and a fifth of a second off Dr. Fager's world record. Easy Goer's unofficial gallop-out time of 1:45 4/5 for 1 1/8 miles, was 1 1/5 seconds faster than the track record set in 1973 by Riva Ridge, and only two fifths of a second slower than Secretariat's former nine-furlong world record on dirt set in the 1973 Marlboro Cup. His next race was the mile and an eighth Grade I Wood Memorial, which in 1989 was run two weeks after the Gotham Stakes and two weeks before the Kentucky Derby. Easy Goer ran close to the lead the entire race and won by three lengths over Federico Tesio Stakes winner Rock Point. He was timed in a relatively moderate 1:50 3/5. However, students of time pointed out that Aqueduct was playing about two seconds slower than normal on the day. =Rivalry with Sunday Silence= Easy Goer was most remembered for his rivalry with Sunday Silence. The two first met in the 1989 Kentucky Derby, run on May 6, with Easy Goer going into the Derby off only 13 days rest running previously in the Wood Memorial, run on April 22; with Sunday Silence going into the Derby off a full month's rest running prior in the Santa Anita Derby, run on April 8. Sunday Silence won the Derby by 2¬Ω lengths over Easy Goer in the relatively slow time of 2:05 on a muddy track similar to the Breeders' Cup Juvenile the previous year. Easy Goer had a small crack in his left front heel that was found the week leading into the Kentucky Derby. The crack was serious enough to cause discomfort and possibly keep him from running. Easy Goer had a history for his difficulty to handle a muddy track at Churchill Downs and seemed to be struggling with the footing. Easy Goer also had traffic trouble in the race, being cut off by Northern Wolf during the first quarter-mile, causing him to check, and Dansil drifted into his path in the final eighth of a mile in the home stretch, causing Easy Goer to alter course. Multiple Grade I winner Awe Inspiring finished third. Sunday Silence won in spite of swerving in sharply to the left bumping into Northern Wolf, then veering out, while being hit by Valenzuela in the home stretch. After the Derby, both horses returned to action two weeks later in the 1989 Preakness Stakes. Throughout Preakness week, as late as the day before the race, Easy Goer's front feet were being soaked in a tub of Epsom salts due to small scratches or cracks on both heels. His ankles and knees were also given ultrasound. Easy Goer, after breaking in the air at the start, made a big, early move down the backstretch which catapulted him to a two-length lead over Sunday Silence with a half mile remaining, with the six-furlong split being run in a rapid 1:09 3/5. Sunday Silence then challenged around the far turn, with both horses running the fastest mile split in Preakness history in 1:34 1/5. Following a nose-to-nose duel for the last quarter mile with Easy Goer running in very tight quarters near the rail, Sunday Silence won by a nose in a fast final time of 1:53 4/5. Jockey Pat Day was criticized for reining Easy Goer's head sideways to the right in deep stretch with a short lead right before the finish line. Day criticized himself, calling his ride \\"a mistake.\\" Bill Christine of the Los Angeles Times, and trainer McGaughey also expressed their opinions on the mistakes they thought Day made during the race. After the race, Day went to McGaughey's barn at Pimlico, after he had been criticized for his ride. Day said, \\"It ran through my mind that I might lose the mount on Easy Goer,\\" Day said. \\"But then I shared some thoughts--I won't tell you what--with Shug and I felt better.\\" After the Preakness, both rivals returned to action three weeks later in the 1989 Belmont Stakes. During that era, New York was the only state in America that banned all race-day drugs and medications; New York didn't allow horses to race on any drugs, while the rest of the country did. The trainer of Sunday Silence, Charlie Whittingham, was angered that the controversial veterinarian Alex Harthill, who treated Sunday Silence earlier for the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, was not licensed in New York and prohibited from practicing. When the gate opened, both Easy Goer and Sunday Silence ran in close attendance to the pace-setting leader through swift early fractions, with Easy Goer making his move around the turn propelling himself to the lead; he then opened up a substantial lead through the stretch. Easy Goer defeated Sunday Silence by eight lengths in the time of 2:26 producing the second fastest Belmont Stakes in history, behind Secretariat, and denied Sunday Silence the Triple Crown. Easy Goer became the first two-year-old champion to win a Triple Crown race since Spectacular Bid in 1979. In the process, Easy Goer seemed to vindicate his reputation as the reigning champion two year-old. The jockey of Sunday Silence, Pat Valenzuela, described Easy Goer's performance as that of a superhorse. The race was run over a fast but not unusually quick track. Easy Goer earned a 122 Beyer Speed Figure, the best in any Triple Crown race since these ratings were first published in 1987. =Remainder of season= Easy Goer went on that year to win the mile and an eighth Grade I Whitney Handicap at Saratoga, defeating older horses by over four lengths in near record time. The older horses he defeated in this Whitney were: Cryptoclearance, earner of just under $3.4 million and winner of the Donn Handicap, Pegasus Stakes, and Widener Handicap; Brooklyn Handicap, Nassau County and Excelsior Handicap winner Forever Silver; Stuyvesant Handicap, Queens County Handicap, and Stymie Handicap winner It's Academic; and Fayette Handicap and Ben Ali Handicap winner Homebuilder. He missed the stakes and track record in the Whitney by 2/5 of a second. The record was then held by Tri Jet, the only horse to ever run a faster Whitney than Easy Goer. Easy Goer earned the time even though he steadied while being trapped and boxed in around the far turn, and he ran his last eighth of a mile in eleven and two- fifth seconds. McGaughey said after the race, \\"I don't know if I've ever seen a horse run the last eighth of a mile that fast going long on the dirt. Sometimes, you see it on the grass when a horse has gone a slow paced mile.\\" Two weeks later at Saratoga, he won the $1.08 million mile and a quarter Grade I Travers Stakes over Grade I Arlington Classic winner Clever Trevor with moderate effort by three lengths also in near-record time. He missed the Travers record by 4/5 of a second. It was the third fastest in Travers history, behind General Assembly and Honest Pleasure. Trainer Jerry Hollendorfer decided to skip the Travers with Haskell Invitational Stakes and Hollywood Futurity winner King Glorious primarily because, during that era, New York banned all race-day drugs and medications, and King Glorious had been treated with Lasix in all nine of his races. New York didn't allow horses to race on any drugs, while the rest of the country did. The trainer of Sunday Silence, Charlie Whittingham, may have chose to skip the Travers because he was angered that the controversial veterinarian Alex Harthill, who treated Sunday Silence earlier in the year, was not licensed in New York and prohibited from practicing. He also may have chose to skip the Travers to rest the horse, as he didn't run Sunday Silence in any race during that month of August. Easy Goer then won the $809,000 mile and a quarter Grade I Woodward Stakes by two lengths on a muddy track, again defeating older horses while carrying more weight and being stuck in traffic, boxed in on the rail and checking hard twice. Easy Goer's victory seemingly squashed the perception that muddy or wet tracks were his Achilles' heel. Day said after the race, \\"Mud is different everywhere.\\" The older horses he defeated in this Woodward were: Metropolitan Handicap, Arkansas Derby and Philip H. Iselin Stakes winner Proper Reality; and Oaklawn Handicap and Gulfstream Park Handicap winner Slew City Slew. This was the final time the Woodward was run at the mile and a quarter distance before being permanently shortened in distance to a mile and an eighth. Three weeks later, he won the $1.09 million mile and a half Grade I Jockey Club Gold Cup by four lengths, again defeating older horses, included among them were the aforementioned Cryptoclearance, who finished second. He also defeated Breeders' Cup Turf and Molson Export Million winner Prized by over 20 lengths in this race, a horse who had defeated Sunday Silence earlier in the year in the Grade II Swaps Stakes. The track was playing dull and slow, but despite the dullness of the racing surface, moderate pace, and relatively slow final time, he ran his sixth and final quarter-mile his fastest, coming home in 24.12 seconds. This was the final time the Jockey Club Gold Cup was run at the mile and a half distance prior to being permanently shortened in distance to a mile and a quarter. The rivalry with Sunday Silence concluded in the Breeders' Cup Classic, run on November 4 at 1¬º miles. With champion honors at stake, the race was labeled \\"Race of the Decade\\" by the horse racing media. Easy Goer was favored by the wagering public based on his Belmont Stakes win and four subsequent Grade I wins, three against older horses. Sunday Silence's regular rider, Patrick Valenzuela, had recently been suspended for cocaine use. Trainer Charles E. Whittingham assigned the mount to Chris McCarron. Easy Goer came into the 10-furlong Classic off the 12-furlong Gold Cup, run on October 7‚Äîa potentially difficult parlay for a trainer, because the longer race can have the hazardous consequence of dulling the colt's natural speed and blunting the quickness that he might need in a shorter race, while generating the horse's stamina at the expense of speediness. In contrast, trainer Charlie Whittingham had run Sunday Silence only twice in the five months since the Belmont, both times over a 1¬º-mile distance‚Äîin the Grade II Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park, where he finished second, and two months later in the Sept. 24 Super Derby at Louisiana Downs, which he won, giving him six weeks rest into the Classic. Easy Goer ran 11 lengths off the lead, about seven lengths behind Sunday Silence, behind the brisk opening fractions of 22:2/5 and 46:1/5, but made a big run down the backstretch and got near his rival at the half-mile point. Sunday Silence then made a charge turning for home and gained the lead in the final furlong, four lengths ahead of Easy Goer. Easy Goer closed ground late with another big move but lost by a diminishing neck to Sunday Silence, who was under strong urging by McCarron, with a final time of 2:00 1/5. Blushing John, the American Champion Older Dirt Male Horse that year, finished behind the top two in third. The victory assured Sunday Silence Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse and Horse of the Year honors for 1989. After the race, McGaughey said, \\"Sunday Silence had a perfect trip and we made a couple of mistakes. Pat and I agree that he made riding mistakes in the Preakness. But in the other races, there were circumstances that contributed to what happened. Maybe when Pat grabbed him after the start, the horse didn't understand what he was doing. Then Pat was content to sit and wait behind Sunday Silence, as he had done before, and the other horse got away from us. In my heart, I think Easy Goer is the better horse; I think anybody would say that if those two ran against each other ten times, each would probably win five.\\" Day said his ride wasn't the best, while also stating, \\"I've said it before, I think Easy Goer was better than Sunday Silence, despite his three to one edge in the head to head races. I'll go to my grave believing that. We lost two photos to him and the one in the Preakness was due to a rider error on my part.\\" Current Daily Racing Form publisher Steven Crist stated in his New York Times article in January 1990 that had the question on the ballot been, \\"Who is the better horse, Sunday Silence or Easy Goer?\\", his view was that a lot more than 19 people would have voted against Sunday Silence. Crist also stated, \\"Easy Goer was a great horse and so was Sunday Silence. I still think Easy Goer had more pure, raw talent. Sunday Silence held the three to one edge over Easy Goer in the races they met, but he never beat him in a way that proved he was just plain better. In Easy Goer's best race, he walloped Sunday Silence by eight lengths in the Belmont. In a few of his close defeats, Easy Goer had legitimate excuses: he lost the Derby on a muddy track he had difficulty handling, and lost the Preakness by only a nose after a dubious ride. In the Classic, where Sunday Silence held him off by a neck, Easy Goer just missed, but left no one thinking it could not have gone the other way.\\" Daily Racing Form's Mike Watchmaker concurred, stating, \\"To this day, you won't have any trouble finding people who believe that Easy Goer was a better racehorse than Sunday Silence. I know this, because I am one of them.\\" \\"Paul Moran of the Los Angeles Times and Newsday agreed, stating, \\"Sunday Silence is Horse of the Year, but most still believe Easy Goer is the better horse. Sunday Silence is Horse of the Year despite never having won at a mile and a half (the classic distance for most of the world) and never having given weight while defeating older horses, as Easy Goer did in three races. He is Horse of the Year despite going one for three during a span of five months while Easy Goer won the Belmont, Whitney, Travers, Woodward and Jockey Club Gold Cup.\\" Easy Goer is the only horse in history to win the Whitney, Travers, Woodward, and Jockey Club Gold Cup. In three of these races, he defeated older horses, becoming one of the few three-year-olds in modern American racing history to do so. Only three Hall of Fame champions (Easy Goer, Kelso, and Slew o' Gold) have ever won the Whitney, Woodward, and Jockey Club Gold Cup in the same year, but Easy Goer was the only three-year-old to complete the triple. He is one of only two horses to ever win the Champagne, Belmont Stakes, and Travers. He is also one of only two horses to notch a Belmont Stakes, Whitney, and Travers triple, and he was the only one to do so in the same year. Additionally, he is one of only five horses to tally a Whitney-Travers double in the same year, with the other four being Key to the Mint, Eight Thirty, Alydar and Java Gold. Since 1919, Easy Goer is one of only ten horses to sweep the Belmont, Travers, and Jockey Club Gold Cup. Since 1973, Easy Goer is one of only eight horses that have won three consecutive Grade I races longer than 1 1/8 miles on dirt (or synthetic), with the other seven being Alysheba and Gentlemen as well as Triple Crown winners Justify, American Pharoah, Secretariat, Seattle Slew, and Affirmed. He was one of the last American-trained horses to win two Grade I races at a mile and a half on dirt (Belmont Stakes and Jockey Club Gold Cup). Easy Goer's 1989 three-year-old campaign is considered by some to be the greatest in American racing history without yielding any year-end championship awards.http://www.jockeysite.com/stories/easygoer.htmhttp://www.hitak.com/home/alydar/easygoer.html With the exception of Horse of the Year, the Eclipse Awards are based on age, and from 1971 until the present time, the American Champion Older Male Horse award was restricted to male horses aged four years old and up. Prior to 1971, the American Champion Older Male Horse award was referred to as \\"Champion Handicap Male Horse.\\" The Daily Racing Form version was open to any horse ages three years old and up, and this award was given to some champions at the age of three, such as Citation, Buckpasser, Sword Dancer, Damascus, and Arts and Letters. The three-year-old Easy Goer conceded weight on scale while defeating top older horses in both the Whitney (G1) and Woodward (G1) Handicaps; defeated leading older horses a third time in the weight-for-age Jockey Club Gold Cup (G1); and beat older horses again in the weight-for-age Breeders' Cup Classic (G1), including future Champion Older Male Blushing John. Had the awards been categorized as they were prior to 1971, Easy Goer most likely would have been named Champion Handicap Male Horse of 1989. =1990: four- year-old season= At four, Easy Goer won the seven-furlong Gold Stage Stakes easily on a sloppy track by over seven lengths, defeating Phoenix Stakes winner Hadif in a final time of 1:22 1/5. Twelve days later, he was third in the Grade I Metropolitan Mile, marking the only time he did not finish either first or second in his career. Easy Goer always had problematic ankles, and his handlers had to work overtime on them during the month. Rumors about his soundness had swirled around the track for the two weeks leading into the race. Easy Goer was beaten by a little more than a length behind eventual Horse of the Year Criminal Type and two-time sprint champion Housebuster while carrying considerably more weight than those competitors (fourteen and seven pounds, respectively). Future Horse of the Year and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Black Tie Affair and two-time Vosburgh Handicap winner Sewickley finished behind the top three. He then won the mile and a quarter Grade I Suburban Handicap by almost four lengths ridden out in a time of 2:00 after going head and head on the lead while sprinting through fast fractions of 46.75 for a half-mile and 1:09.87 for six furlongs. He defeated Jerome Handicap winner De Roche, as well as Brooklyn Handicap and Stuyvesant Handicap winner Montubio. The final time was 3/5 of a second off Alysheba's then track record, which had been set in a weight for age race. Easy Goer conceded to his opponents. In Easy Goer's 20-race career, he was never defeated by more than 2¬Ω lengths. After his Suburban Handicap win, Easy Goer was retired due to a bone chip in his right front ankle. He won 14 races, including 9 Grade I wins at seven furlongs, a mile, a mile and an eighth, a mile and a quarter, and a mile and a half while earning $4,873,770. Stud record After his retirement from racing, Easy Goer stood stud at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky. He was given the honor of occupying the number one stall in the number one barn. His stall was previously occupied by Bold Ruler and Secretariat. At age eight, in 1994, Easy Goer collapsed and died while jogging in his paddock at Claiborne Farm. Dr. Thomas Swerczek, the veterinary pathologist at the University of Kentucky, who conducted Easy Goer's necropsy, determined the horse died of an anaphylactic reaction to an undetermined allergen and also had cancerous tumors in multiple organs. The veterinarians were convinced the cancer did not kill Easy Goer and probably would not have been fatal for a long time. They also said fatal allergic reactions are more common than most professionals realize. Easy Goer was buried at Claiborne Farm along with Secretariat, Buckpasser, Bold Ruler and many other greats. At stud, in just a few crops before his premature death, Easy Goer sired three Grade I winners and nine stakes winners (7%), from 136 foals, of which 101 were starters, and 74 were winners. While speed at distances up to a mile had been favored over \\"stoutness\\" in much American breeding, Easy Goer demonstrated speed over a mile as well as stamina. Given the combination of his pedigree and the high- quality mares to which he was bred at Claiborne, it was speculated by The Blood-Horse that he would have been even more significant as a stallion had he lived longer. Easy Goer has also been an influential broodmare sire. From 53 mares sired by Easy Goer, they have produced 23 stakes winners. Notable Offspring Easy Goer was the sire of: * Will's Way - won the Whitney Handicap and Travers Stakes like his sire, and in turn sired Lion Tamer, winner of the Cigar Mile Handicap, Hutcheson Stakes, Commonwealth Stakes, and Gulfstream Park Sprint Championship.

Honors and Assessments In 1997, Easy Goer was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Easy Goer was ranked # 34. Easy Goer won the Eclipse Award as American champion 2-year-old male in 1988. Easy Goer graces the cover of the 2005 book, \\"Belmont Park: A Century of Champions,\\" with paintings by Richard Stone Reeves and text by Edward L. Bowen. Belmont Park, the renowned racetrack, has played host to some of Thoroughbred racing's greatest champions, from Man o' War and Citation to Secretariat and Cigar. Belmont Park is known as \\"The Championship Track\\" because nearly every major American champion in racing history has competed on the racetrack. Belmont Park, with its wide, sweeping turns and long homestretch, is considered one of the fairest racetracks. The book chronicles seventy racehorses who competed from 1905 to 2005 thrilling fans, setting records, and becoming legends at the venerable New York track. Easy Goer's rivalry with Sunday Silence was featured as the 17th chapter of Horse Racing's Greatest Rivalries (2008, Eclipse Press), a compilation produced by the staff of The Blood-Horse. Easy Goer's duel with Sunday Silence in the 1989 Preakness was ranked #70 in Horse Racing's Top 100 Moments, a review of racing in the 20th century compiled by The Blood-Horse and released in 2006. Easy Goer was retrospectively awarded a Timeform rating of 137 pounds which was tied with his arch-rival Sunday Silence for second place among American runners of the 20th century. Only Cigar at 138 pounds was rated higher. Easy Goer was one of thirty champion Thoroughbreds inducted into the Saratoga Hoofprints Walk of Fame as part of the inaugural class in 2013. The Saratoga Hoofprints Walk of Fame is designed to pay homage to the most accomplished thoroughbreds to compete at Saratoga Race Course during its 150-year history. It honors the most prolific and notable horses to have raced at one of the nation's most historic tracks. The Easy Goer Stakes run every Belmont Stakes day at Belmont Park is named in his honor.

Oyberland, \\"Highland\\"; , translit. Galil E'lion, \\"Upper Province\\") were the Jews who inhabited the northwestern regions of the historical Kingdom of Hungary, which are contemporary western Slovakia and Burgenland. \\"Oberland\\", in this context, is a Hungarian-Jewish historiographic term, unrelated to the territory of Upper Hungary (Oberungarn, sometimes Oberland).Menahem Keren-Kratz. Cultural Life in Maramaros County (Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia): Literature, Press and Jewish Thought, 1874-1944. Ph.D disertation submitted to the Senate of Bar-Ilan University, 2008. OCLC 352874902. pp. 23-24. Its origin lies in the immigration pattern of Jews into the country during the 18th century. Those arriving from Austria and Moravia settled in the adjacent counties of the northwest, mainly from Trencs√©n to Sopron, and gradually spread further; however, a large swath in the center of northern Hungary, between Szepes and Hajd√∫, remained closed for Jewish settlement until all residential limits were lifted in 1840. Thus, a demarcation line separated the Austrian and Moravian Jews from the Galician Jews, who emigrated to the northeastern territories. Those west of it were known as \\"Oberlander\\" (highlanders), and the Galicians were \\"Unterlander Jews\\" (lowlanders). In rabbinic sources written in Hebrew, it was translated as the Upper and Lower Provinces (Galil E'lion, Galil Takhton).M. E. Gonda, Yits·∏•a·∏≥ Yosef Kohen, I. M√°rton. Yehude Hungaryah : me·∏•·∏≥arim his·π≠oriyim. ha-Agudah le- ·∏•e·∏≥er toldot Yehude Hungaryah (1980). OCLC 16130215. p. 128. The designation was coined by the former. After 1840, the geographical boundary dividing Oberland and Unterland was the linguistic one between Western Yiddish and Middle (\\"Polish\\") Yiddish: It stretched from the Tatra Mountains, between Popr√°d (present-day Poprad) and Lipt√≥szentmikl√≥s (present-day Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°), Nagyszabos (present-day Slavo≈°ovce) and Rozsny√≥ (present-day Ro≈æ≈àava), continuing just north of Debrecen and south of Miskolc, until reaching the Hungarian border in Kolozsv√°r (present-day Cluj-Napoca).Jechiel Bin-Nun. Jiddisch und die Deutschen Mundarten: Unter Besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung des Ostgalizischen Jiddisch. Walter de Gruyter (1973). p. 93. While sometimes applied to all western Jews, like those in Budapest and beyond, it came to denote the Orthodox ones who resided in contemporary Slovakia, west of the boundary detailed above, and in contemporary Burgenland.Yeshayahu A. Jelinek, Paul R. Magocsi. The Carpathian Diaspora: The Jews of Subcarpathian Rus' and Mukachevo, 1848-1948. East European Monographs (2007). p. 5-6. Their ancestors arrived in two waves: The first, comprising Austrians, came after the expulsion of the Jews from Vienna in 1670. They were welcomed by Paul I, Prince Esterh√°zy, who allowed them to settle in Burgenland and to form the Seven Communities on his lands.Peter F. N. H√∂rz. J√ºdische Kultur im Burgenland: historische Fragmente, volkskundliche Analysen. Institut f√ºr Europ√§ische Ethnologie (2005). p. 187. Another, much larger, wave entered Hungary in the wake of an Imperial decree from 1727, which limited the number of Jews allowed to marry in Moravia to 5,106. It remained in effect until 1848.Wilma Iggers. The Jews of Bohemia and Moravia: A Historical Reader. Wayne State University Press (1992). p. 57. Oberland also followed an acculturation pattern of its own, as its Jews tended to embrace the German language and culture.Michael Brenner. Kleine j√ºdische Geschichte. C.H.Beck (2012). pp. 214-215. In spite of undergoing thorough modernization, they remained largely Orthodox, and were primarily influenced by the Hatam Sofer and his disciples in the yeshiva of Pressburg, the province's largest city. However, they were mostly more moderate and educated than the Unterlander, and the differences between Neo-Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox in the country paralleled geographic ones. While Hasidism was rampant in Unterland, it had never reached the northwest.Michael K. Silber. The Emergence of Ultra-Orthodoxy: The Invention of Tradition. In: Jack Wertheimer, ed. The Uses of Tradition: Jewish Continuity since Emancipation (New York-Jerusalem: JTS distributed by Harvard U. Press, 1992). pp. 41-42. During the 19th century, Hungarian Jews were roughly divided into three cultural groups: the Magyarized, Hungarian-speaking and heavily Neolog ones in the center of the kingdom; the modern Orthodox, non-Hasidic, German-speaking Oberlander; and the Unterlander, who were strongly influenced by Hasidism.Robert Perlman. Bridging Three Worlds: Hungarian-Jewish Americans, 1848-1914. University of Massachusetts Press (2009). p. 65.Bernard Spolsky. The Languages of the Jews: A Sociolinguistic History. Cambridge University Press (2014). p. 212. The Oberlander shared a common dialect of Western Yiddish, mixed with Hungarian and Slovak vocabulary. Their customs resembled those of pre-emancipation German Jews, like donning prayer shawls before marriage and laying phylacteries in the weekdays of the Pilgrimage Festivals. Following World War II, some integrated in East European Ultra-Orthodox groups, while others joined Hungarian Hasidic sects like Satmar, Nitra, Vien, Puppa, and Kashou. Several congregations that self- identify as Oberlander and adhere to such customs are present in Israel, New York, in London's Stamford Hill, and in Antwerp.

John Morris locates Sawyl in the south Pennines area (the modern Peak District, a name which may date from its settlement by the Anglian Pecset).Bromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein p. 256; John Morris (1973), The Age of Arthur pp. 214-215. He is listed as one of the \\"Three Arrogant Men of the Island of Britain\\" in the Welsh Triads.Rachel Bromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein, third edition, 2006, p. 45 Other genealogies say he was the father of St. Asaph. Elis Gruffydd's Chronicle says that his daughter married Maelgwn Gwynedd.Bromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein, p. 496 An Irish genealogy says that a \\"Samuel Chendisel\\"Chend-isel is the Irish equivalent of the Welsh Pen-isel, \\"low-head\\". married Deichter, daughter of Muiredach Muinderg, the king of Ulster, and they had two sons: Sanctan, who became bishop of Cil-d√°-les and founded Kilnasantan in County Dublin, and Mat√≥c Ailithir. The Irish Liber Hymnorum confirms that both Sanctan and Mat√≥c came to Ireland from Britain.Peter C. Bartrum (1993), A Welsh Classical Dictionary, National Library of Wales, pp. 580-581. According to the Welsh Life of Saint Cadoc, a king named Sawyl Penuchel held court at Allt Cunedda near Kidwelly in Carmarthenshire. Cadoc pursued Sawyl's warband after they stole food from Llancarfan Abbey. He found them sleeping under a tree and cut off their hair, before fleeing to a nearby bog. When Sawyl and his men gave chase, they all drowned in the bog.Bromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein p. 496. Whether this is the same king, having fled to Wales after his northern kingdom was overrun by the Angles, a different man of the same name, or simply an error by the composer of the Life, is unclear. This Sawyl was supposedly buried in a nearby mound known as Banc Benuchel. When this mound was excavated in 1850 a large body covered with a hexagonal stone imitating a battle-shield was discovered, which people have presumed to have been the remains of Sawyl Penuchel. The skeleton was described as male and the age at death was estimated at 30 years on the basis of the teeth. Precise measurements which were supplied in report in the 1851 Archaeologia Cambrensis and a subsequent report in The Welshman stated that the skull \\"was 21¬Ω ins in its horizontal circumference 6¬Ω ins broad and 7¬Ω ins long ... The thigh bones were perfect and 20¬Ω ins long, and the fibula of the arm was 11 ins\\". According to this account the remains were re-interred \\"apart from the teeth and two or three vertebra which were kept as souvenirs\\". Later inquiries made with local people who remembered the original excavation (the work was led by Mr Fitzwilliam, on whose land one of the tumuli stood, accompanied by Mr Fenton of Glynmel, Fishguard) recalled that \\"they came to a very large flat stone which gave them a lot of trouble to remove. When it was done the skeleton of a large, powerful man was discovered in a sitting position and facing south.\\" The bones, especially the legs, were of \\"large size\\" and the skull \\"had a hole in it\\". Asked what became of the skeleton, the witnesses agreed that the landowner (Fitzwilliam) had them sent to London - but where precisely was not clear. A subsequent excavation in 1881 resulted in no body being found; this suggested that the 1851 report in Archaeologia Cambrensis, which stated that the bones were re-interred, may not have been entirely true. Inquiries made in 1937 about the whereabouts of the remains of Sawyl were inconclusive.

Otis mainly presented the afternoon links on BBC One alongside the main CBBC presenters. Otis was thought to be inspired by the 1992 Children's BBC idents which ended with a voice proclaiming \\"Tell that aardvark it's a wrap\\". These idents led to much speculation as to what the phrase meant. However, these idents were dropped just before the character of Otis appeared in late 1994. Otis is said to have obtained his name from the OTIS Elevator in the CBBC building at BBC Television Centre. Dave Chapman was the puppeteer. He also performed in a number of other Children's BBC programmes, notably as The Cat from Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow. When Fully Booked moved to Sundays on BBC2, the extended Saturday CBBC was renamed Saturday Aardvark, with Otis being a key feature. In 1996, he presented CBBC on Nickelodeon during school hours on Nickelodeon alongside Nick Junior and his co-presenter was mascot Arthur the Ant in front of an ice cream parlour. He left in 1997 and was replaced by his cousin Marvin who presented from a shed until the strand finished on 16 July 1999. After leaving CBBC in late 1999 Otis appeared on a puppet based quiz show before the puppet was finally laid to rest, with the announcement given claiming that the character had gone to work at the BBC canteen, although Otis made appearances on other CBBC shows including Insides Out and Live & Kicking and Clever Creatures until 2001. Otis was followed by another puppet called Emlyn the Gremlyn, who supported the live human presenters on the early afternoon links for a further two and a half years . On 28 December 2007, Otis reappeared on a special 'puppet' edition of The Weakest Link for the BBC. He was voted off in the second round by Roland Rat (who hilariously nicknamed him as \\"Otis The Anteater\\"), Nobby The Sheep, Jelly and Jackson, Zippy and George and Soo (puppet), while he, Roly Mo and Nev the Bear each voted for Zippy and George. In a 2009 interview BBC Presenter Kirsten O'Brien revealed that she has the Otis the Aardvark puppet and once used it unsuccessfully to impress a date. On 1 April 2010, Otis appeared on the ITV2 show Celebrity Juice. Otis made another appearance along with other former presenters and puppets on 9 September 2015 to mark the 30th anniversary of CBBC.

Retrieved 2012-04-12 It is a local specialty of the Gangwon province of South Korea, and its capital city, Chuncheon. Makguksu at Doosan Encyclopedia  Ingredients and preparation  Makguksu is closely related to naengmyeon, the archetypal Korean cold noodle dish. However, its differences lie in the high concentration of buckwheat flour in its noodles ‚Äî the result of the grain being a staple crop in the Gangwon-do area, and the use of greater amounts of vegetables. The dish gets its name \\"rough noodles\\" because the buckwheat used is generally unhulled. Makguksu is usually prepared directly from buckwheat crop, soaked, and ground into a paste. Since buckwheat is less glutinous than most grains, buckwheat flour is particularly difficult to knead, roll, and slice into noodles by hand; thus, the noodles are often created in a hand- cranked noodle-making machine instead. It is difficult to generalise regarding makguksu's accompanying ingredients. Ingredients are traditionally determined by the customer rather than the restaurant owner, and many restaurants also carry their own unique flavouring recipes. In most cases, makguksu is very spicy, sometimes seasoned with gochujang (hot chile pepper paste). Various types of kimchi can be added as well: nabak kimchi, dongchimi or baechu kimchi. Makguksu at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture Many recipes also add various vegetables and/or soy sauce. Banchan (side dishes) vary in equal measure. In the Chuncheon area, the dish is frequently accompanied by boiled beef or pork; elsewhere, it may be served with bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes) or gamjajeon (potato pancakes).  Chuncheon  Makguksu has become a large part of the identity of the Chuncheon region. In recent decades, a \\"buckwheat noodle street\\" featuring more than a dozen makguksu restaurants has developed in the downtown area. There is a makguksu museum, and the city also hosts the annual Chuncheon Makguksu Noodle Festival, featuring makguksu tastings and other celebrations.

He was the author of The Soong Dynasty, The Marcos Dynasty, Gold Warriors and numerous other books which address unofficial and clandestine aspects of the 20th-century political history of countries in the Far East. Personal life Born in Columbus, Ohio on April 15, 1937, Seagrave grew up on the China- Myanmar border, the fifth generation of an American family living in the Orient for nearly two centuries (his father was Dr. Gordon Seagrave, author of Burma Surgeon).Seagrave, Gordon S., Burma Surgeon, W. W. Norton & Company, New York, 1943 He and his family moved to Corpus Christi, Texas and he attended W. B. Ray Highschool from 1953 to 1955. Seagrave's collaborator and wife of 35 years was Peggy Sawyer Seagrave, who died about a year before her husband. Seagrave died on May 1, 2017 in France, where he had been living for more than 30 years with his wife. Seagrave's death was not announced publicly until July 31, 2017. History publications Seagrave worked as an investigative journalist in Asia, and he contributed to several major newspapers and magazines.

Gillin, a Sinologist affiliated with Hoover Institution, wrote a book Falsifying China's History: The Case of Sterling Seagrave's The Soong Dynasty, in which he criticised Seagrave's book The Soong Dynasty as being biased against Chiang Kai-shek. Dragon Lady challenges the notion that the Empress Dowager Cixi used the Boxers in the Boxer Rebellion. Kang Youwei is said to be the source of false stories which stained her reputation. In the book, Cixi is portrayed sympathetically. In its review of Gold Warriors: America's Secret Recovery of Yamashita's Gold, which dealt with allegations that post World War II the CIA had misappropriated billions of dollars of Japanese war loot (the titular Yamashita's Gold), BBC History Magazine noted that whilst \\"numerous gaps remain.... this is an important story, with far-reaching implications, that deserves to receive further attention\\".

Most often, \\"Julian laws\\", Lex Iulia or Leges Iuliae refer to moral legislation introduced by Augustus in 23 BC, or to a law from the dictatorship of Julius Caesar.  Lex Iulia de Civitate Latinis et Sociis Danda (90 BC)  Apart from Augustus's laws on marriage, this is probably the best known of the laws under this name. In the midst of the Social War, a conflict between the Italians and the Romans over the withholding of Italian citizenship, the consul Lucius Julius Caesar passed a law to grant all Italians not under arms citizenship. It was primarily passed to prevent those who had not risen up against Roman rule from doing so. The next year, the Romans introduced the lex Plautia Papiria de Civitate Sociis Danda, which granted Roman citizenship to the allies which had rebelled, in an attempt to further stem the rebellion.Pallottino, M., A History of Earliest Italy, Routledge Revivals, (2014), p. 157  Lex Iulia de Repetundis (59 BC)  This law was passed by Gaius Julius Caesar, restricting the number of 'gifts' that a governor could receive during his term in a province, and also ensured that governors balanced their accounts before leaving a province.  Lex Iulia Municipalis (45 BC)  Sets regulations for the Italian municipalities. See Tables of Heraclea.  Moral legislation of Augustus (18‚Äì17 BC) Under Augustus, the Leges Juliae of 18‚Äì17 BC attempted to elevate both the morals and the numbers of the upper classes in Rome and to increase the population by encouraging marriage and having children (Lex Julia de maritandis ordinibus). They also established adultery as a private and public crime (Lex Julia de adulteriis). To encourage population expansion, the Leges Juliae offered inducements to marriage and imposed disabilities upon the celibate. Augustus instituted the \\"Law of the three sons\\" which held those in high regard who produced three male\\"The Romans: From Village to Empire: A History of Rome from Earliest Times to the End of the Western Empire\\" by M. Boatwright, et al. 2nd edition. 2011. offspring. Marrying-age celibates and young widows who wouldn't marry were prohibited from receiving inheritances and from attending public games. =Augustan Leges Iuliae= * Lex Iulia de Ambitu (18 BC): Penalising bribery when acquiring political offices. * Lex Iulia de Maritandis Ordinibus (18 BC): Limiting marriage across social class boundaries (and thus seen as an indirect foundation of concubinage, later regulated by Justinian, see also below). *Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis (17 BC): This law punished adultery with banishment. The two guilty parties were sent to different islands (\\"dummodo in diversas insulas relegentur\\"), and part of their property was confiscated. Fathers were permitted to kill daughters and their partners in adultery. Husbands could kill the partners under certain circumstances and were required to divorce adulterous wives. Augustus himself was obliged to invoke the law against his own daughter, Julia (relegated to the island of Pandateria) and against her eldest daughter (Julia the Younger). Tacitus adds the reproach that Augustus was stricter for his own relatives than the law actually required (Annals III 24) * Lex Iulia de vicesima hereditatum (5 AD): (on inheritance tax) instituted a 5 percent tax on testamentary inheritances, exempting close relatives. * Lex Papia Poppaea (9 AD): (to encourage and strengthen marriage) is usually seen as an integral part of Augustus' Julian Laws. The Lex Papia Poppaea also explicitly promoted offspring (within lawful marriage), thus also discriminating against celibacy. Later updates to the Julian laws The extracts below are from later legal codes and textbooks, but are also valuable in the sense that they are based on, and frequently quote from, the actual text of Augustus' laws. =Ulpian (3rd century)= As written down by Ulpian ;The Lex Julia relating to marriage: (Epitome 13-14) By the terms of the Lex Julia, senators and their descendants are forbidden to marry freedwomen, or women who have themselves followed the profession of the stage, or whose father or mother has done so; other freeborn persons are forbidden to marry a common prostitute, or a procuress, or a woman manumitted by a procurer or procuress, or a woman caught in adultery, or one condemned in a public lawsuit, or one who has followed the profession of the stage.... =Justinian (6th century)= Under the rule of Emperor Justinian ;The Lex Julia on adultery: (Institutes 4, 18, 2-3) Public prosecutions are as follows....the Lex Julia for the suppression of adultery punishes with death not only those who dishonour the marriage bed of another but also those who indulge in unspeakable lust with males. The same Lex Julia also punishes the offence of seduction, when a person, without the use of force, deflowers a virgin or seduces a respectable widow. The penalty imposed by the statute on such offenders is the confiscation of half their estate if they are of respectable standing, corporal punishment and banishment in the case of people of the lower orders. :(Digest 4, 4, 37) But as regards the provisions of the Lex Julia....a man who confesses that he has committed the offence [i.e. adultery] has no right to ask for a remission of the penalty on the ground that he was under age; nor, as I have said, will any remission be allowed if he commits any of those offences which the statute punishes in the same way as adultery; as, for example, if he marries a woman who is detected in adultery and he declines to divorce her, or where he makes a profit from her adultery, or accepts a bribe to conceal illicit intercourse which he detects, or lends his house for the commission of adultery or illicit intercourse within it; youth, as I said, is no excuse in the face of clear enactments, when a man who, though he appeals to the law, himself transgresses it.

The festival first began in 2005. This annual event ran for 2 days in October and exhibited a number of short films, spread over 12 hours of screenings. The 2007 Sefton Short Film Festival exhibited 65 films and attracted submissions and guests from across the world. The festival was originally established in 2005 by Ann Monks. It was intended not only to be a place where new filmmakers can have a chance to have their work seen by a larger audience, but also as a way to get more people interested in short films as a medium. The festival had also funded local filmmakers by organising film production courses. These courses covered all aspects of film making, from initial visualisation and script writing, through planning and shooting including camera work and sound recording, down to final editing and post production techniques. The festival had been supported by Frank Cottrell Boyce, writer of Millions and 24 Hour Party People, Sally Bankes from Little Britain and Opiate Of The People Films. Submissions for the S2F2 short film festival were welcomed from around the world and were usually accepted from April.

The principal anthropometry measures are the upper arm length, the triceps skin fold (TSF), and the (mid-)upper arm circumference ((M)UAC). The derived measures include the (mid-)upper arm muscle area ((M)UAMA), the (mid-)upper arm fat area ((M)UAFA), and the arm fat index. Although they are not directly convertible into measures of overall body fat weight and density, and research has questioned the connection between skinfold fat and deep body fat measurements, these measures are and have been used as rough indicators of body fat. Factors influencing the bone, fat, and muscle composition of the upper arm include age, sex, nutritional status, fitness training level, and race.  Measures  The anthropometric measures of the upper arm are divided into principal measures, which are measured directly, and derived measures, which are derived from the principal measures using specific formulae and empirically-derived corrections. The derived measures attempt to provide better indicators of body composition and nutritional status than the principal measures, by accounting for the fact that external measurements of the arm necessarily compound measurements of bone, fat, and muscle. = Principal measures = The three principal anthropometric measures of the upper arm are the upper arm length, the triceps skin fold (TSF), and the mid- upper arm circumference (MUAC). The triceps skin fold is the width of a fold of skin taken over the triceps muscle. It is measured using skinfold calipers. (See body fat percentage#Skinfold methods for general information on skinfold fat measurements.) The measurement is taken at a standardized position (one of eight standard skinfold measurement points) at the midpoint of the back of the upper arm. The skinfold calipers are spring-loaded. Holtain skinfold calipers are marked with 0.2 mm gradation, Lange calipers with 0.5 mm gradation. The measurement is taken with the person standing upright, with arms hanging down loosely. The skin fold is pulled away from the muscle and measured with the calipers, taking a reading 4 seconds after the calipers have been released. The measuring point is halfway between the olecranon process of the ulna and the acromion process of the scapula. The mid-upper arm circumference is the circumference of the upper arm at that same midpoint, measured with a non- stretchable tape measure or 3D printable bands.3-D printing open-source click-MUAC bands for identification of malnutrition. Public Health Nutrition, doi:10.1017/S1368980017000726 open access = Derived measures = The derived anthropometric measures include the mid-upper arm muscle area (MUAMA), the upper arm fat area (UFA), and the arm fat index. The mid-upper arm area (MUAA) is an estimation of the area of the upper arm. It is derived from the MUAC using the following formula: *MUAA = frac{MUAC^2}{4 pi} The mid-upper arm muscle circumference (MUAMC) is an estimation of the circumference of the bone and muscle portions of the upper arm. It is derived from the MUAC and the TSF by accounting for the thickness of the subcutaneous fat that surrounds the muscle, using the following formula, with the MUAC and TSF values measured in millimetres: *MUAMC = MUAC - left ( pi times frac{TSF}{10} right ) The mid-upper arm muscle area (MUAMA) is an estimation of the area of the bone and muscle portions of the upper arm. It is derived from the MUAMC using the following formula, with the MUAMC as above: *MUAMA = frac{MUAMC^2}{4 pi} The corrected mid-upper arm muscle area (CMUAMA) is an estimation of the area of the muscle portions of the upper arm, attempting to eliminate the area due to bone. It is derived from the MUAMC using the following two formulae, with the MUAC and TSF values measured in centimetres: *For men: CMUAMA = frac{left ( MUAC - left ( pi times frac{TSF}{10} right ) right )^2 - 10}{4 pi} *For women: CMUAMA = frac{left ( MUAC - left ( pi times frac{TSF}{10} right ) right )^2 - 6.5}{4 pi} The mid-upper arm fat area (MUAFA) is an estimation of the area of the far portions of the upper arm, and is simply the difference between the MUAA and the MUAMA: *MUAFA = MUAA - MUAMA From the MUAFA is derived the arm fat index (AFI), a percentage of the arm that is fat, using the following formula: *AFI = 100 times frac{MUAFA}{MUAA}  Theory and practice  = Validity = The sex-specific constant correction values in the corrected MUAMA formulae are derived from empirical studies. The MUAMA formula assumes that the upper arm has a circular cross-section, with a uniform subcutaneous fat layer and negligible bone content. This is, of course, not the case in reality. The correction factors are attempts to discount the contribution of the humerus. By comparing MUAMA values against computed tomography, studies by Heymsfield et al. found that, at the maximum circumference of the triceps, the contribution of bone to the total cross- sectional area was 18% in men and 17% in women, which were 10 cm¬≤ and 6.5 cm¬≤ respectively. Even the corrected MUAMA formulae are not valid for people who are obese or for older people. They tend to overestimate muscle area for obese people. The results of the formulae can contain small but significant errors in the cases of young people, and errors of up to 41.5% for older people. Moreover, the size of the humerus is not in fact equal in all individuals. It also varies with nutritional status. The formulae for the derived measures are based upon an assumption that the arm is cylindrical in shape, and are thus based upon the simple geometry of a cylinder. The arm is not in fact an ideal cylinder. However, the assumptions of the formulae yield results that are close enough to actual reality that the measurements are reliable and accurate when averaged over groups of people. The principal measurements are also subject to error. Taking a triceps skin fold measurement too frequently or for too long can result in compression of the tissue, and false readings, for example. Even which arm is measured matters, since mid-upper arm circumference is generally greater on the dominant arm (e.g. the right arm for right-handed people). Few studies make specific note of which arms were measured. = Evaluation = The various measures are evaluated against anthropometric reference data tables, such as those derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measurement, if conducted by well-trained staff, can give a quick assessment of new arrivals at a refugee camp during a humanitarian crisis. It is based on the observation that this measurement does not change much in children between 6 months and five years old, so comparison to a \\"normal\\" measurement is useful. Based on analysis of field results, MUAC < 125mm corresponds to Global Acute Malnutrition and MUAC < 115mm with or without Oedema corresponds to Severe Acute Malnutrition. = Correlation = The various measures have been shown to have correlation to other measurements of body fat, including those derived from X-ray absorptiometry. However, the relationship between measurements of subcutaneous fat in skinfolds, such as the triceps skinfold, and deep body fat have been questioned. Early research in the 1960s found a positive correlation between the two, and the skinfold measurements do provide a reasonable estimate of the deep body fat. However, research in the 1980s used computed tomography to measure deep fat, and showed a lack of correlation between that and subcutaneous fat. However, for children and adolescents the skinfold and circumference measurements provide a fair assessment of total body fat because that is where most body fat lies during those stages of human growth.  Variations  Many factors influence the bone, fat, and muscle composition of the upper arm, and their measurements can vary by age, gender, obesity, fitness training status, and race. (This is one reason that anthropometrists have to be careful about what reference data and correction values they employ for individuals.) The World Health Organization uses arm circumference-for-age as an anthropometric indicator for its Child growth standards. One cause of age variations is the tendency for body fat to be deposited internally, rather that subcutaneously, as one ages. Nutritional factors include zinc intake, which has been shown to have effects on both the triceps skin fold thickness and the mid-upper arm circumference.

Later works have been published via Quirk Books and has been credited with giving the company enough funding to expand.  Concept  A worst-case scenario is the most severe possible outcome that can be projected to occur in a given situation. Conceiving of worst-case scenarios is a common form of strategic planning to prepare for and minimize contingencies that could result in accidents, quality problems, or other issues. The books provide instructions for situations like landing a plane and surviving a shark attack.

It was created in 1971 from two faculties of the historical University of Paris ‚Äî colloquially referred to as the Sorbonne ‚Äî after the French May of 1968, which resulted in the division of one of the world's oldest academic institution. The double origin of the founders ‚Äì Luchaire and Bartoli from the Faculty of Law and Economics and Ahrweiler from the Faculty of Letters ‚Äì is now found in the name of the university: Panth√©on for law and Economics, Sorbonne for humanities.http://www.univ- paris1.fr/universite/http://www.univ- paris1.fr/universite/presentation/historique/luniversite-paris-1-pantheon- sorbonne-aujourdhui/ Pantheon-Sorbonne has three main domains: Economic and Management Sciences, Human Sciences, and Legal and Political Sciences; comprising several subjects such as: Economics, Law, Philosophy, Geography, Humanities, Cinema, Plastic arts, Art history, Political science, Mathematics, Management, and Social sciences. Pantheon-Sorbonne's headquarters is located on the Place du Panth√©on in the Latin Quarter, an area in the 5th and the 6th arrondissements of Paris. The university also occupies part of the historical Sorbonne campus. Overall, its campus includes over 25 buildings in Paris, such as the Centre Pierre Mend√®s France (\\"Tolbiac\\"), the Maison des Sciences √âconomiques, among others. Pantheon-Sorbonne was globally ranked 287th (9th of France) in the 2021 QS World University Rankings and 601-800th (32nd of France) in the 2020 The Times Higher Education. It was also ranked by the 2019 QS Rankings by Subject as being 1st in France in Archaeology, History, Law, and Economics. In the French Eduniversal rankings, it is ranked 2nd of France in Economics and 2nd in Law.  History  Helene Ahrweiler, one of the cofounders of Paris 1 The historic University of Paris () first appeared in the second half of the 12th century, but was reorganised in 1970 as 13 autonomous universities after the student protests of the French May. Following months of conflict between students and authorities at the University of Paris at Nanterre, the administration shut down that university on May 2, 1968. Students of the University of Paris protested the closure and the threatened expulsion of several students at Nanterre on May 3, 1968. After the student protests of May and June 1968, thirteen universities succeeded to the University of Paris (nicknamed \\"the Sorbonne\\"), which ceased to exist. Pantheon-Sorbonne University was established in 1971 by Professors Fran√ßois Luchaire (Law), Henri Bartoli (Economy) and H√©l√®ne Ahrweiler (Humanities) from two faculties of the historical University of Paris ‚Äî colloquially referred to as the Sorbonne ‚Äî after the French May of 1968, which resulted in the division of one of the world's oldest academic institution. The double origin of the founders ‚Äì Luchaire and Bartoli from the Faculty of Law and Economics and Ahrweiler from the Faculty of Letters ‚Äì is now found in the name of the university: Panth√©on for law and Economics, Sorbonne for humanities. While Paris-Sorbonne University and Sorbonne Nouvelle succeeded the faculty of humanities of the University of Paris, Panth√©on-Assas University the faculty of law and economics,Conac, pp. 177-178 and Pierre and Marie Curie University and Paris Descartes University the faculty of sciences, Panth√©on-Sorbonne University was founded on a wish for interdisciplinarity by bringing together disciplines. Indeed, most of the law professors of the faculty of law and economics of the University of Paris wished only to restructure their faculty into a university.Conac, pp. 177-178. However, most of the faculty's economists and political scientists and some public law professors sought to create a university which would extend beyond the disciplinary compartmentalisation;Conac, p. 178. they hurried ahead of their colleagues and established Paris I--which would later be called \\"Panth√©on-Sorbonne\\"--with professors of both the faculty of human sciences and the faculty of law and economics. The name of the university show this interdisciplinarity: the Sorbonne building is the traditional seat of the Humanities studies in Paris (hence it is also used by Paris III and University Paris-Sorbonne), and the Panth√©on building is, with the Assas building,Conac, p. 191. the traditional seat of the law studies (hence it is also used by Panth√©on-Assas University).

It was serialized in Analog magazine beginning in the April 1972 issue. The title refers to the construction of a submerged floating-tube pontoon bridge/tunnel across the Atlantic Ocean in the novel. Plot summary In an alternative history, the United States lost the American Revolutionary War and George Washington was executed for treason. Thus, America in 1973 is still under the control of the British Empire. The divergence point between this world and our own occurred far earlier, however, when the Moors won the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa on the Iberian peninsula, on July 16, 1212. Thus it was that Spain was unable to become unified, owing to the survival of an Islamic presence in its territory, and therefore could not finance the expedition of Christopher Columbus in 1492. Instead, it was John Cabot who discovered America, just a few years later. The protagonist, Captain Augustine Washington, is a direct descendant of George Washington, and labors in his 'traitorous' shadow. Captain Washington and Sir Isambard Brassey-Brunel (descendant of Isambard Kingdom Brunel) get together to link the heart of the British Empire with its far-flung Atlantic colony in North America, although they fall out over Augustine's wooing of Isambard's young daughter, Iris, and as a result of disputes over engineering techniques. However, after a number of adventures the two are reconciled on Sir Isambard's deathbed, and the lovers later marry. Detective Richard Tracy also makes an appearance, as do 'Lord' Amis and 'Reverend' Aldiss. An appearance in connection with a suborbital rocket is also made by an expert who prefers a mechanical Babbage machine for computing to the electronic kind named Arthur C. Clarke.

It has been translated into English by John Brownjohn under the title Berlin Blues. The book has sold more than 1 million copies in German and Regener received the Deutscher Filmpreis in gold for the screenplay. The story tells of the life of Frank Lehmann in Berlin in 1989. Regener's prequel Neue Vahr S√ºd (published in 2004) tells of Frank Lehmann's life in the year 1980, especially his time in the Bundeswehr (German armed forces) while the middle part of the trilogy Der kleine Bruder (the little brother) (published 2008) tells of two days in November 1980, when Frank Lehmann arrives at Berlin and tries to find his older brother Manfred who lives as an artist in Berlin Kreuzberg. After these two days of odyssey Frank is no longer the \\"little brother\\".  Plot  Frank Lehmann works as a barkeeper in Kreuzberg, West Berlin, complacent and drinking frequently, with few other ambitions. His 30th birthday is fast approaching, and as a result, he is teasingly called \\"Herr Lehmann\\" (\\"Mr Lehmann\\") by his friends. The book follows Frank Lehmann's daily life in Kreuzberg and showcases the attitude of a generation of young adults West Berlin in autumn 1989 in the months leading up to the Fall of the Berlin Wall. = Chapters 1‚Äì7 = The first third of the book recounts the events of a single day. Shortly before dawn on a Sunday morning, Herr Lehmann is walking home from work, drunk, and comes across a dog that is blocking his path. Herr Lehmann is afraid of the dog and is overwhelmed by the situation. Here, like in many other portions of the text, the reader is given direct access to Herr Lehmann's thoughts. The comedy of the situation is derived from the discrepancy between Herr Lehmann's thoughts and actions, but the subjective narrative voice allows the reader to comprehend the rational reasons for the discrepancy. Herr Lehmann solves the problem with the dog by giving it whiskey, whereupon he is found by two policemen who threaten to report Herr Lehmann for animal cruelty. The dog bites one of the policemen, and Herr Lehmann finally finds his way home. In the morning, Herr Lehmann is woken by a phone call from his mother, who announces that she and his father are coming to visit him in Berlin. Hungover and unexcited about the upcoming visit, Herr Lehmann makes his way to a nearby pub and meets Karl, his best friend. The pub is full of \\"Sunday breakfasters\\", who annoys Herr Lehmann. Out of spite, Herr Lehmann orders pork roast for breakfast, which makes the new cook, Katrin, cross. This leads to a philosophical argument between them about \\"time\\" and \\"purpose in life\\", and Herr Lehmann is immediately smitten with her. He meets her again twice that day, in the afternoon at a pool, and again in the evening during his shift at the bar. = Chapters 8‚Äì20 = Chapters 8 through 20 follow Herr Lehmann's life over the course of the next couple of weeks, focusing on his relationships with Katrin, his parents, and Karl. Karl works in the same bar as Herr Lehmann, but is also an artist who is scheduled to have an opening later that autumn. The narrative remains narrowly focused on Herr Lehmann and his everyday life, ignoring the external historical and political situation as much as possible. Herr Lehmann attempts to travel to East Berlin and is detained by the customs official for hours. Herr Lehmann is principally bothered by the limitations on his personal freedom and how his day did not go according to plan, rather than any political aspects of the situation. He is fixated only on his environment, friends and his life in his walled-in \\"island\\" of West Berlin. On Herr Lehmann's \\"island\\", each of his relationships come to a head. All three threads of the story lead into dead ends: his relationship with Katrin falls apart when they realize they both had entirely different expectations; his parents' visit show his supposed independent, self-actualized life is an empty self-deception; and Karl suffers a nervous breakdown shortly before his art opening, destroying his sculptures. Each of these events destroys part of Herr Lehmann's self-image, and he comes to realize that he needs to escape from his \\"island\\". Throughout the novel, it is implied that Karl has been abusing stimulant drugs, and Herr Lehmann has to take him to the hospital, as Karl is suffering from acute psychological problems. Herr Lehmann has to admit that he is not in a position to help his friend. On top of this, the evening is also Herr Lehmann's 30th birthday. After leaving the hospital, Herr Lehmann sets out to celebrate his birthday alone by bar-hopping through West Berlin and using alcohol to escape, which has been a recurrent theme throughout the book. = Conclusion = While Herr Lehmann is bar-hopping, the news comes out that the Berlin Wall has fallen. Herr Lehmann participates with a mixture of interest and boredom, watching history happen in front of him. The story ends with the impression that Herr Lehmann's personal life also will see a fresh start. The novel closes with Herr Lehmann's thoughts: \\"I'm just going to get moving [...]. The rest will unfold by itself.\\" Film Leander Hau√ümann did an adaption with the same name for the screen with the former MTV video jockey Christian Ulmen in the title role.

He taught modern history at Oxford University from 1884 to 1920. He was an Honorary fellow, formerly fellow, lecturer and tutor in modern History, of Worcester College, Oxford. He was the Conservative MP for Oxford from 1917 to 1922, and for York from 1923 to 1929. After defeat in 1929 he retired from active politics. During the course of his lifetime he wrote more than forty books on British and European history, as well as current political subjects. He was knighted in 1924.Concise Dictionary of National Biography, 1992 Early life Marriott was born in Bowdon, Cheshire, the son of a solicitor from a family of minor landowners. He was educated at Repton School and New College, Oxford, graduating in 1882 with a Second in Modern History. As an undergraduate he was an active member of the Canning Club, a Conservative society. Educationist and historian In 1883 Marriott became a lecturer in Modern History at New College, and soon after at Worcester College, of which he became a Fellow in 1914. In 1886, he was recruited by M. E. Sadler as an Oxford University extension lecturer, to give lectures in towns across the country. He was a \\"natural platform orator... notable for characteristic gestures and the full sweep of his gown\\". In 1895 he became secretary of the Extension delegacy, which he remained until 1920. Marriott wrote prolifically, on modern English and European history, the British Empire, and on political institutions. His books, aimed at a non-specialist audience, benefitted from his experience as an extension lecturer. Politician Marriott had been politically active as an undergraduate, and in 1885 was adopted as the Conservative candidate for East St Pancras, although he later withdrew. In 1886, he was selected for Rochdale but lost in the general election to the defending Liberal, Thomas Bayley Potter. He applied for selection as Conservative candidate for the Oxford University by-election in 1914, but was not successful. In 1917 he was elected unopposed under the war-time electoral pact to represent Oxford City in the by-election following the elevation to a UK peerage of Arthur Annesley. Re-elected in 1918 (in the so-called Coupon Election), he lost his seat in the general election of 1922 to Frank Gray, the Liberal. Marriott returned to parliament in 1923 for York, defending his seat successfully in the 1924 general election, but lost in 1929 to a Labour candidate, Frederick George Burgess. Personal life In 1891 Marriott married Henrietta Robinson, daughter of the warden of Trinity College, Glenalmond and they had one daughter, Cicely, in 1892.

The rhyme was first recorded in the 1840s, but it may have older origins in street cries and verse of the seventeenth century. It refers to the equestrian statue of King Charles I in Charing Cross, London, and may allude to his death or be a puritan satire on royalist reactions to his execution. It was not recorded in its modern form until the mid-nineteenth century. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 20564. Lyrics Modern versions include: The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 20564. Origin Wenceslas Hollar's engraving of the statue The rhyme is thought to refer to the equestrian statue of Charles I (r. 1625‚Äì49), which was erected after the Restoration in 1660 and was moved in 1675 to the site of the old Charing Cross in central London. The tarnished bronze statue is largely dark in colour, but the \\"black\\" may refer to the king's hair colour. The last line may refer to the reaction of the crowd when he was beheaded, or it may be a puritan satire on royalist reactions to the event. The rhyme may also have been produced out of a combination of existing couplets. A traditional London street cry was: or A note of a ballad in a seventeenth-century manuscript at OxfordMS Ashmole, 36, fol 113. contains the lines: The first part was printed as a children's rhyme in a variation of the more famous \\"Ride a Cock Horse\\" in Pretty Tales, published in 1808, with the lyrics: The modern version, which may combine elements of this rhyme with a reference to the execution of Charles I, was first collected and printed by James Orchard Halliwell in the 1840s.J.

Several names are used for the malevolent Johnny Green, including Tommy O' Linne (1797) and Tommy Quin (c. 1840).

The fear that children might be affected by the violence of the rhyme and specifically that children might be tempted to put cats in wells, led to several attempts to reform the rhyme.

Chopped ham is a mixture of ham chunks and trimmings and seasonings, ground together and then packaged into loaves. By chipping or shaving the meat loaf against a commercial meat slicer blade, the resultant thinly sliced product has a different texture compared to thickly sliced ham. In western Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and eastern Ohio, the slicing process is also referred to as \\"Pittsburgh style\\". Sometimes the chopped ham, once chipped, is mixed and heated with barbecue sauce before it is made into a sandwich. In the Pittsburgh region, sandwiches of \\"ham barbecue\\" or \\"barbecued chipped ham\\" are commonly served at home and available at lunch counters. The ham can also be fried before being put on a sandwich; this version is often referred to as \\"frizzle fry\\". The chain Isaly's helped to popularize chipped chopped ham. Chipped chopped ham reached a broad audience in the post-World War II era when it was heavily marketed as a luncheon meat suitable for packed lunches. Former United States Army soldiers likened it to Spam, to which they had grown accustomed while in the army. Its popularity has been furthered by its relatively low cost per pound. The product is produced by a few meat packing facilities that process pork products and is marketed under a variety of commercial brand names.

Although in its early stage the society's most important members came from the Whampoa Military Academy, and constituted elements of the KMT's Whampoa Clique, by the 1930s its influence extended into the military and political spheres, and had influence upon China's economy and society. The rise and fall of the Blue Shirt Society was rapid, but obscure, and was seldom mentioned again by either the KMT or the Communist Party of China after the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the following KMT domination on Taiwan. Birth The Blue Shirts origins can be traced to the Whampoa Clique of 1924 - professional military officers - many of whom had sworn personal loyalty to Chiang Kai-shek, as well to the ideals of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. After the Northern Expedition of 1927, Chiang and the KMT seized most of China's territories. The government established was in a degree of social crisis: there were tensions as Japan's conquest of Manchuria; Chiang had also formally split the First United Front, the alliance between the KMT and the CCP (Communist Party of China), turning the two parties against each other. The CCP had bases in the cities and to a lesser degree in the countryside, posing a threat to Chiang's government. The KMT itself was not of one mind; divided into several cliques, there were power struggles between Chiang, Hu Hanmin and Wang Jingwei. China was still scourged by corruption, poverty, and infrequent civil war. Being the foundation of Chiang's rule, some Whampoa graduates felt it time to take action. Consequently, in July 1931, (ÊªïÂÇë) and Xiao Zanyu (Ëï≠Ë¥äËÇ≤) were sent back to China to investigate the threat from Japan and any forthcoming war. When Teng and Xiao returned to China, they were upset to find the KMT, in their eyes, \\"gravitating toward decadence\\". Teng designed a blueprint to reform the KMT, suggesting a single great and powerful leader could save China and the KMT. The leader could rule by all means, hopefully as a benevolent dictator. Chiang was a sound candidate, and over the following months Teng traveled around the capital of Nanjing seeking support from Whampoa fellows. Teng was acquainted with Zeng Kuoqing (ÊõæÊì¥ÊÉÖ), among the first graduates of Whampoa, and the man in charge of the Whampoa Alumni Association. Because the KMT banned organized political parties, Teng and Zeng searched for alumni in secret. Zeng used his influence and personal relations among Whampoa graduates to organize periodic meetings to discuss Teng's plan. After several months the group included prominent Whampoa graduates, including He Zhonghan (Ë≥ÄË°∑ÂØí), widely regarded as one of The Three Most Outstanding Whampoa graduates (the other two being CCP members Jiang Xianyun (Ëî£ÂÖàÈõ≤) and Chen Geng (Èô≥Ë≥°), the patriarch of the Sun Yat-sen Theory Research Group at that time); Hu Zongnan (ËÉ°ÂÆóÂçó), a rising young general in Chiang's National Revolutionary Army; Deng Wenyi (ÈÑßÊñáÂÑÄ), another patriarch of the Sun Yat-sen Theory Research Group and a secretary to Chiang, and; Feng Ti (‰∏∞ÊÇå), the Commissar of the 1st Division of the KMT army. In September 1931, in the third meeting of the group, an organization to reform the KMT and fight against Japan was decided. Under the direction of He Zhonghan, this group was named the Society of the Practice of Three Principles of People (‰∏âÊ∞ë‰∏ªÁæ©ÂäõË°åÁ§æ, SPTPP). Teng was elected General Secretary. The party also issued guidance on the establishment, discipline and organization of members, and confirmed its main mission as follows: :1. use secret measures to fight against the Japanese, the CCP, other KMT cliques, and ensure the Whampoa clique's domination of the KMT and China; :2. use the public image of the Whampoa Alumni Association to enroll new members and set up a formal, well-organized and highly disciplined group. Funds were mainly raised by Deng, who ran the KMT's Party Book Shop, a publishing house for party-political propaganda. Furthermore, to avoid arrest under the KMT's political organization ban, members decided not to tell Chiang Kai-shek of their plan, even while regarding him as their spiritual mentor and leader. Before long Kang Ze (Â∫∑Êæ§), who published the China Daily newspaper with the permission of Chiang, became the mouthpiece of the SPTPP. In December 1931, under pressure both inside and outside the KMT, Chiang resigned. While in retirement at his hometown in Zhejiang, Chiang showed growing interest in Benito Mussolini's fascism. Deng subsequently let Chiang know of the existence of the SPTPP. Chiang summoned He, Teng and Kang to a meeting, where he announced his idea for a more formal and disciplined organization like those in Italy and Germany. Thus specific rules and articles to guide the party were drafted. With support from Chiang, Teng designed a hierarchical organization style. At the top was Chiang, with the foundations made from the elite of Whampoa graduates. New members could only be accepted with two recommendations and approval from Chiang himself. Members were not allowed to resign unless the group faced dissolution. If there was any violation of discipline, members would receive severe punishment. In 1932 Chiang regained the presidency after a power struggle between his opponents. Hoping to speed reform of the SPTPP, in a secret meeting in February Gui Yongqing (Ê°ÇÊ∞∏Ê∏Ö), a member of the SPTPP, recommended Liu Jianqun (ÂäâÂÅ•Áæ£) as a suitable candidate. Liu, He Yingqin's (‰ΩïÊáâÊ¨Ω) secretary, contributed much to the group. Liu wrote a pamphlet called Some Opinions On The Reform of the KMT. In this, Liu proposed reform of the KMT be enforced via a group of elites established and organized along the lines of Mussolini's MVSN or Blackshirts. Members would wear blue shirts to pledge their allegiance. Accordingly, the leader should encourage by his sublime, superior spirit. Under the direction of the leader, all members would live simple and disciplined lives, and all cadres would be treated equally, with incomes and lives under strict supervision. Violation would be severely punished. In return, the people would entrust property and their families to the country and the supreme leader. Public responsibilities would depend on ability, from military service to absolute obedience of orders including surveillance of one's neighborhoods. Lives would be divided into stages, including a youth wing. Thus, China would be turned into a militarized society, with a three tier organization, highest to lowest: Supreme Leader - Blue Shirt Society - People. Liu Jianqun ordered membership be kept a secret: \\"With a view to attaining the object of immediately overthrowing the feudal influences, exterminating the Red Bandits, and dealing with foreign insult[s], members of the Blue Shirts Society should conduct in secret their activities in various provinces, xian, and cities, except for the central Guomindang headquarters and other political organs whose work must be executed in an official manner.\\" Chiang met with Liu and appreciated his theory, leading to the evolution of the SPTPP into the Blue Shirt Society (BSS). In March 1932, under cover of an existing club called the Spirit Encouragement Society (ÂãµÂøóÁ§æ), the SPTPP officially announced its establishment. Although Liu's proposal that members wear blue shirts and name their society after the blue shirts was not accepted, the SPTPP was privately known as the BSS from then on. In its formal opening ceremony, Teng was elected General Secretary, with He, Kang as Standing Secretariat. The BSS consisted of six divisions: Secretariat, Organization, Propaganda, Military, Special Agency and Logistics. The secret society reached its peak, with the BSS infiltrating the country's political system, military and even the everyday lives of people. Rise and achievements During the early to mid-1930s Chiang was busy carrying out his suppression of the CCP's Red Army in the countryside. With his permission, the BSS took over the defense of Nanking. Most of the prominent Whampoa graduates now got promotions as commanders and became BSS members. Besides increasing its influence in the army, the BSS infiltrated the police and security services in major cities, and recruited members in the KMT youth league. The BSS now had influence in China's military, labor unions, publishing houses and schools. A new structure of power had emerged, with the BSS at the core of the Whampoa Clique, coexisting and competing against the two better known cliques: the CC Clique, led by Chen Lifu (Èô≥Á´ãÂ§´) and Chen Guofu (Èô≥ÊûúÂ§´), whose remit was dealing with party issues, and; the Politics Research Group (ÊîøÂ≠∏Á≥ª) led by Yang Yongtai (Ê•äÊ∞∏Ê≥∞) and Zhang Qun (ÂºµÁæ§), whose remit was the day-to-day running of the KMT government. Liu's pamphlet was accepted as the guideline of the BSS, and part of it was revised into the Regulation of Life Discipline. In accordance with this, BSS members would be paid low wages, with part being donated to the BSS. Gambling and opium were banned. Anti-corruption laws and laws prohibiting BSS members from having mistresses were to be strictly abided by. The practice of BSS members became quite distinct from the majority of KMT bureaucrats. In June 1932, an anti-graft campaign was launched under the direction of BSS member, Deng Wenyi. A special force, mostly comprising BSS members, cracked down on corrupt police officers in Wuhan. After several arrests and executions, the police force was considered improved. Deng then waged war against organized crimes, prostitution, opium and gambling. After 3 months, Deng had won Chiang's praise. Chiang wanted this effort to be promoted around the country, and so launched a campaign to purify the capital. The results were less successful and derided as a failure. Meanwhile, the BSS was playing an active role in suppressing the CCP. Zeng Kuoqing, using his status in the Whampoa Alumni Association, wrote a letter to Xu Jishen (Ë®±ÁπºÊÖé), commander of Zhang Guotao's 4th Red Army and a Whampoa graduate, asking Xu to defect to the KMT. Xu did not reply, but when his superiors discovered the letter, suspicions were raised and the CCP decided to carry out a purge. Thousands of commanders and soldiers were tortured and executed, weakening the CCP's resistance. In light of this, in October 1932, Hu Zongnan led his army (mainly commanded by BSS officers) in a cruel and decisive battle against Xu Xiangqian in Hekou Anhui. In contrast to other KMT armies, the army had high- morale, was composed of hand-picked men, and equipped with the best weaponry. With strong support from other armies also led by BSS members such as Yu Jishi (‰øûÊøüÊôÇ) and Huang Jie (ÈªÉÊù∞), Xu's CCP army was routed. After suffering some 10,000 casualties, Zhang and Xu retreated. Hu and his troop chased, and when Zhang and his army reached Sichuan to set up another base, Hu remained in Gansu nearby. Hu, with his chosen men and strong army, became known as the King of Northwestern China. Coinciding With the BSS's ever-increasing power and influence, disagreements within the BSS leadership mounted. Chiang, who regarded the BSS as a tool, would not allow them more power and influence. Teng could not accept this and conflicts between him and Chiang were frequent. In 1933, Chiang chose He Zhonghan to succeed Teng as General Secretary of the BSS. As a more ambitious and skilled politician than Teng, He Zhonghan won a power struggle against his BSS rival Liu Jianqun. Subsequently, He decided to set up a propaganda network run by Kang Ze. This special agency under the direction of Dai Li, and his deputy Zheng Jiemin (ÈÑ≠‰ªãÊ∞ë), evolved into a network infiltrating every corner of China. The BSS's influence grew into Northern China, which was under direct threat of invasion by Japan. In 1933 the Japanese army invaded Rehe, and KMT armies fought against them along the Great Wall. The BSS now changed from an elite secret society into an anti-Japanese mass movement. Liu was sent to the BSS's Northern China Division, which was called the China Reconstruction Society (‰∏≠ËèØÂæ©ËààÁ§æ, CRS). Most members were university lecturers and student groups, and in the summer of that year the CRS had divisions in 24 provinces of China with more than 40,000 members. With the CRS controlling the political training system of the KMT, new recruits were always available. With thousands of members, political instructors and front organizations, the BSS had a kingdom under the direction of He. Besides setting up the CRS, the BSS also played a part in the Second Stage Revolution. Using influence in Northern and Southwestern China to persuade local warlords to pledge allegiance to Chiang, a reform of the KMT armies was carried out. An air force and armored corps was set up, alongside wars against corruption, opium and poverty. Reconstruction of rural areas was undertaken, with roads built and bank loans provided to peasants. The most significant part of this movement was Kang Ze's New Jiangxi Style and Special Detachment (Âà•ÂãïÈöä, NJSSD). In 1933 during the 5th Suppression Campaign against the CCP, Chiang decided to set up a paramilitary force. Kang was appointed to lead the NJSSD, the only direct military group in the BSS. Soon the NJSSD had integrated of military, political, police, military police and secret police powers. At its peak it had 24,000 members and three divisions of regular troops. The NJSSD had peasants living near Soviet Jiangxi and Northern Anhui categorized and confined, where they had limited access to the outside world. A family hoping to prove itself non-CCP needed to have the guarantee of four other families, and promise not to collaborate with or provide support to the CCP. Violations would have the whole family executed, along with the families of the four guarantors. The NJSSD set up hundreds of concentration camps around Shangrao, Jiangxi, where they tortured and executed residents and CCP captives. Under this system, fewer and fewer peasants supported the CCP. Merchants who smuggled materiel to the CCP were also broken down, with peasants organized to build blockades against the Soviet Territory. With the shortage of supplies, accompanied by heavy attacks from the KMT, the CCP had to launch its now- famous Long March in order to retreat. The NJSSD started the New Jiangxi Style plan in territories previously occupied by the Communists, providing compulsory education and free medical treatment to peasants. With a brutal but effective anti-corruption campaign, they provided loans, seeds and pesticides also. Nevertheless, the NJSSD engaged in fervent brutality, executions of perceived CCP sympathisers, and innocents. In one case, in Mount Dabie, previously the base of the 4th Red Army in Northern Anhui, more than half a million were massacred. At the same time, in accordance with NJSSD and New Jiangxi Style, Kang reached the peak of his career, and he raised enough finances to challenge He as leader of the BSS. Xiao Zuolin (ËÇñ‰ΩúÈúñ), a BSS member early on, drafted a plan called the Whole New Culture Movement and proposed the establishment of an organization called the Chinese Culture Academy to increase the BSS's influence in culture. Xiao got Deng Wenyi's support and carried out his plan by taking over several newspapers and journals, and by enrolling its members in universities. Its scheme of forging a movement for a new culture was adopted by Chiang, and on 19 February 1934, he announced the New Life Movement at a meeting in Nanchang. The plan involved reconstructing the moral system of the Chinese and welcoming a renaissance and reconstruction of Chinese national pride. In March, Chiang issued guidance, consisting of 95 rules of the New Life Movement, being a mixture of Chinese traditions and western standards. It was a vast propaganda movement, with war mobilization and military maneuvers on a scale that China had never experienced before. But because the plan was so ambitious and rigid, and because its policies created too much inconvenience in the everyday lives of the people, it fell into disfavor. Nearly three years later in 1936, Chiang had to accept that his favorite movement had failed. Deng, Kang and Jiang Xiaoxian (Ëî£Â≠ùÂÖà), Chiang's nephew and bodyguard, also BSS members were appointed General Secretariats of the New Life Movement, with supervision of public lifestyles enforced by BSS cadres. By controlling the mouthpieces of the KMT, the BSS openly expressed advocacy of fascism in its publications. Fall Unlike Teng, He was a professional politician, and never concealed his ambition for power. After fostering a Hunan Clique in the BSS, Chiang became concerned the BSS might threaten his governance. In 1934 he accused the BSS of corruption and malfunction, dismissing He as General Secretary. Liu Jianqun was appointed as successor. With NJSSD and the Southwestern Clique behind him, and the Zhejiang Clique led by Hu Zongnan and Dai Li opposing him, Liu Jianqun's BSS faced the same fragmented fate as the KMT it had helped get rid of. With the New Culture Movement failed but still officially ongoing, the BSS spread its influence into the cultural centers of Shanghai and other major cities that used to be the CC Clique's power base. In June 1934, the Nanchang Airport, built by donations from international Chinese, and designed to train the KMT air force, was burned down. The Aviation Commissioner, Xu Peigen (ÂæêÂüπÊ†π), who was also a BSS member, was the primary suspect. Deng was sent to investigate this case. He reached the conclusion that the fire was accidentally caused by a cigarette dropped by a soldier, but Chen Lifu and Yang Yongtai argued Xu masterminded the fire to eliminate evidence of corruption, and Deng had colluded to cover it up. Xu was kept in custody, Deng was sacked, and his titles were removed. The Chinese Culture Academy was banned. Dai Li was sent to take over Deng's investigation agency and quietly integrated it into his own special agency, which later evolved into the Military Statistical Bureau, the notorious secret police of the KMT. Dai no longer played any major part in the BSS now he had set up his own kingdom. Taking advantage of this blow to the BSS's prestige, the Politics Research Clique consummated the Administrative Office System, adding new levels of administration between provinces and counties (the two tier system of provinces and counties had been used in China for more than a thousand years). With the appearance of new offices, the Politics Research Clique was able to control the county level. Many bureaucrats who used to be loyal to the CC Clique and the BSS defected to the suddenly more powerful Politics Research Clique. The Politics Research Clique took over the security forces, the police and the militia step by step. Liu, whose failures in the BSS were an embarrassment, was replaced by Feng Ti under the excuse that he had health problems. He was sent to Manchuria to work with Zeng Kuoqing. In 1935, two editors of a pro-Japanese newspapers were assassinated in Manchuria. The Japanese thought these actions were taken by the BSS and argued it was a violation of the Tanggu Accord signed to keep the status quo between the Japanese and China. Yoshijir≈ç Umezu (Ê¢ÖÊ¥•ÁæéÊ≤ªÈÉé), commander of the Japanese China Garrison Army and Kenji Doihara's (ÂúüËÇ•ÂéüË≥¢‰∫å) Japanese intelligence agency investigated and presented a memo to He Yingqing. Agreeing with the Japanese recommendations in this memo, all Chinese forces heavily influenced by the BSS (including military police, regular forces such as the 2nd Division and the 25th Division) should be evacuated from Beijing and out of Hebei province. Taking over military training for the KMT, Feng Ti enrolled new members into the BSS. Hu Zongnan, Dai Li and other former BSS members also strengthened their grip on power by enrolling members into their own private armies. At the top were hundreds of Whampoa graduates, aided by some 30,000 mid- and low- level officers, university teachers and public servants. Below them were more than 200,000 members of the CRS. At the bottom were hundreds of thousands of boy scouts. With the organization undergoing such rapid expansion, corruption and inefficiency plagued the BSS across the country. Furthermore, in 1935, there was a serious security leak in its headquarters after the BSS tried to assassinate Wang Jingwei, Chiang's presidential rival. Under heavy pressure, Feng Ti was sacked. Liu Jianquan took over, to be replaced in turn by Zheng Jiemin. In 1936 Deng Wenyi became General Secretary of the BSS, just in time for December's Xi'an Incident. Chiang was kidnapped and held by General Zhang Xueliang, who favored fighting the Japanese more than the CCP. There were disagreements between KMT leaders on whether to solve the kidnapping by peace talks or military action. In BSS meeting, He Zhonghan and Deng were determined to use force and called for the mobilization of BSS members around the country. 176 young generals issued a statement to denounce Zhang Xueliang and declare war on his army. Under He's direction, more than 2000 officers and BSS members held a meeting pledging their allegiance to Chiang and agreeing to mobilize against the Young Marshall. Gui Yongqing led an army of more than 12,000 men in armored vehicles across the Yangtze River towards where Chiang was being held, while a few bombers were launched by overzealous military and BSS officers. Chen and other KMT leaders refused to support this, however, and even He Yingqing, who was in charge of the KMT military, did not agree with the BSS's movement. No official support was given by the KMT. Chiang's wife Soong Mei-ling came to Xian for peace talks. Due to the efforts of the CCP delegation, led by Zhou Enlai, who wanted to set up an alliance with the KMT against the Japanese, Chiang was released several weeks later. After his release, Chiang took revenge on the BSS's reckless action and lack of control. Deng was sacked, with all titles removed again, and he was replaced by Kang Ze. He Zhonghan was out of favor with Chiang and forced to travel around Europe in exile. In March 1937, Chiang issued his order that all BSS activities be temporarily suspended. With the Second Sino-Japanese War breaking out on 7 July 1937, Japanese troops seized vast areas of China. Before Nanjing fell, Kang led the retreat of the BSS from its headquarters. In 1938 the BSS held its first and last national congress in Wuhan. Here, members of the BSS and SPTPP were permitted to have their memberships automatically transferred to the KMT, members of the CRS could be transferred to the Youth League of Three Principles of the People (‰∏âÊ∞ë‰∏ªÁæ©ÈùíÂπ¥Âúò, YLTPP). Most of the 500,000 members of the BSS and CRS refused to transfer to the KMT, instead choosing the YLTPP, which became the basis of a new force within the KMT. Hu Zongnan kept the position of Director of the YLTPP, while Kang acted as his agent. The biggest winner was Dai Li: his new spy agency, the Military Statistical Bureau was formed, and he transferred all the intelligence agents of the BSS, CRS and NJSSD into it, giving him one of the largest intelligence services in the world. He kept control over this secret empire until his death in an airplane crash in 1946. The BSS had been officially dismissed, but Kang wished to keep it alive under the cover of the YLTPP. In the following 7 years he increased YLTPP membership from 400,000 to more than 1.5 million, and used NJSSD techniques to re-organize the YLTPP. The result was a group more efficient and disciplined than the KMT, which aroused Chiang's suspicion again. After returning from the Soviet Union, Chiang Kai-shek's son Chiang Ching-kuo sought to take over the YLTPP. Kang was reluctant and tried to resist these efforts, sealing his fate. In 1945 Kang was sent to Europe and Chiang Ching-kuo was given the YLTPP's seat. During the Chinese Civil War, members of the YLTPP suffered the same fate as the KMT. Only prominent YLTPP figures such as Kang survived CCP purges, as examples of clemency toward war criminals. Legacy The following were some of the most prominent and earliest members of BSS. Teng was later appointed as mayor of Nanjing. He went to Taiwan in 1945 with KMT troops and later retired from the position of chairman of Central Trust Bureau of the KMT. After years of retirement, he was appointed director of Labor Bureau. In 1949, when the KMT retreated to Taiwan, he was Minister of Communication and Policy Counsellor. Liu's wife was an agent working for Kenji Doihara, bringing many confidential documents with her on defecting to the Japanese. After this, Liu himself was forced to become a fugitive to escape Dai Li's secret police. After becoming a monk and spending years in Guizhou, Chiang's men found him by chance. Chiang showed leniency by offering Liu a position as vice-speaker of the KMT Congress. When he went to Taiwan, Liu lived in poverty, and before his death in the 1960s his last contribution was to provide valuable details for an article on the BSS written by an American professor. Having risen and fallen several times, Deng showed little interest in politics after the Sino-Japanese War. He arrived in Taiwan in 1949 and retired as Director of the Political Work Bureau. Feng Ti was appointed as commander of guard for Changsha, but was executed in 1938 after KMT forces engaged in a scorched earth policy to resist the invasion of Japanese army. The resultant fires killed thousands of civilians Kang returned from Europe during the Chinese Civil War and was sent to the battlefront. Captured and made a POW, KMT propaganda depicted him as a martyr. In reality, Kang lived well in custody and defected to the CCP. In 1963 he was released in a CCP amnesty and died 4 years later. Hu's troops were annihilated by CCP armies during the Civil War. When he left for Taiwan in 1949, he was impeached by 46 members of the KMT's Control Yuan for incompetence in military command. Although Hu was released with no charge, he was appointed a defense commander for a little island and never returned to central politics. After retiring, he died in 1962. Zeng was captured and made a POW in the Civil War. Later released by the CCP, he died in 1983. Gui was made commander of the KMT navy during the Civil War, then went to Taiwan. He died during his term as Chief of Staff of the KMT Army in 1954. Dai Li became head of secret police and espionage of the KMT, and died in an air crash in 1946. His assistant, Zheng, succeeded Dai in running the KMT secret police. He died in 1959 in Taiwan. References ;General *Ding, San. Lanyishe suipian.

The steppe lemming eats shoots and leaves and is more active at night, though it is not strictly nocturnal. In the wild, it is found in Russia and Ukraine in steppes and semiarid environments. Fossil remains of this species have been found in areas as far west as Great Britain. Description The steppe lemming has a body length of up to 12 cm and a tail of 2 cm, a little shorter than the hind foot. It weighs about 30 g. The eyes and ears are small and the fur is a uniform shade of brownish-grey with a black dorsal stripe.AgroAtlas Distribution This lemming is found in steppe, forest-steppe and semidesert parts of western Mongolia, northwest China, many parts of the former USSR, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, the southern and middle Ural, and western and eastern Siberia. Ecology The steppe lemming is a colonial species digging lengthy burrows. It has a partially underground mode of life, being active during the day, but only going above the surface for short periods. It feeds on various parts of plants, including seeds. It reaches sexual maturity at the age of six weeks and can produce up to six broods in a year, with five or six young in each. Under favourable conditions, reproduction continues throughout the year. The numbers of steppe lemmings vary greatly according to climatic conditions and the availability of food. Migrations are observed during years of mass outbreaks. Steppe lemmings as pets It is the most common domestic vole, being particularly well known in Europe. (In the US and Canada, it is still considered an exotic animal.) In captivity, they can live over two years, but they are usually mistreated with small cages (a 10-gallon tank is best for a colony) and improper diets. Although the steppe lemming is social by nature and should not be held in captivity alone, if a colony of steppe lemmings is held together for a long period of time (two to three months) they may become hostile to each other (mainly to the subordinate members of the colony). If there is only one separate nesting area, two entrances or exits should be placed, due to the attack style of the more impetuous lemmings. They also tend to be very territorial animals, so a low male population is best in captivity. Overall, three to eight steppe lemmings in one cage or aquarium is ideal, with no more than one male for every two or three females. Standard rodent food containing bits of dried fruit is not appropriate; as their natural diets do not contain much sugar, steppe lemmings are somewhat diabetic, and become sick or even die from overdosing on sugar. A sugar-free, no molasses food that does not contain dried fruit and little sunflower and other oily seeds should be used; laboratory rodent foods may be a cheap alternative. Additionally, steppe lemmings need grass and other leafy greens, such as alfalfa, to thrive. Grass gathered outdoors may harbor parasites and toxins and should not be used unless gathered from meadows away from inhabited areas, roads and not frequented by dogs or used for grazing. No matter where any grass or moss has been obtained, and even if it is only intended for bedding, it should be kept in a freezer for three days to eliminate parasites such as lice and mites. Clean water should be always available; the amount actually drunk varies with the food consumed. Willow twigs need to be provided for abrading the continuously growing teeth. Lemmings can drink from a shallow dish, but since they typically track their bedding into the water, a bottle with a ball valve is better. Lemmings enjoy any kind of running or climbing; however, as their habitat is essentially flat and rather featureless terrain, they have a poor sense of height and danger, so their enclosures should not be high enough to allow them to fall more than 10‚Äì15 cm and should, of course, be lined with wood chips and hay. An exercise wheel is the best way to keep the animals busy and trim, and if the wheels afford enough space, they will often race in it together. (However, fights can often develop around wheels - with males, particularly, it is helpful to have several wheels, perhaps even one for each lemming.) =Aggression= Motives for fighting In general, steppe lemmings are friendly animals and prefer to live in colonies. Even small groups of males (preferably from the same litter) can live quite peacefully. However, males do tend to be territorial and a mature alpha male will nearly always attack a stranger and will often mistreat other members of his own litter, particularly if the nest is overcrowded. A large, well-filled terrarium (about 5‚Äì10 cm wood chips covered by about 10 cm of hay) can allow a group to live far more peacefully; altercations should be expected in smaller spaces with little bedding. Fights (as well as unintentional accidents) can also occur in and around exercise wheels. Once a male has become aggressive - even with an outsider - he should be considered dangerous, watched very closely and - if possible - be neutered and placed with a group of females. Although neutering a lemming is a difficult operation typically attempted only by veterinary hospitals, it is possible. A neutered alpha male will generally not become less aggressive toward other males. Fights, wounds and necessary precautions The aggressor will try to trap the defending lemming in a corner and then attack with his teeth and short claws. Excited chirps, chattering and running typically accompany a fight - in most cases, the whole colony will be disturbed. (While activity of this kind is amusing for new owners, it should be observed very carefully, since peaceful lemming colonies are much quieter than ones characterized by aggressive behavior.) Since lemmings like to nest in small, narrow enclosures (like boxes the size of a fist), it is important for the enclosure have a second exit, so the defender can escape into another part of the terrarium. Lemming fights sometimes leave no exterior signs of violence, but can cause fatal internal bleeding. More often, fights result in lacerations, often around the hind legs, bottom and genitals. Lemmings hurt in a fight should be placed in terraria or cages separate from the aggressor as soon as possible. Also, their natural tendency to scratch and lick at wounds can cause slow healing. A veterinarian may prescribe antibiotics and infection retardants to help an injured lemming, generally at reasonable costs. While it can be very difficult to convince an injured lemming to drink its medicated drops or eat food laced with medicine, a good trick is to place drops of medicine on the lemming's nose. Through licking itself clean, the lemming will ingest the medicine.

W. Alexander. Statement Two homeomorphisms of the n-dimensional ball D^n which agree on the boundary sphere S^{n-1} are isotopic. More generally, two homeomorphisms of Dn that are isotopic on the boundary are isotopic. Proof Base case: every homeomorphism which fixes the boundary is isotopic to the identity relative to the boundary. If fcolon D^n to D^n satisfies f(x) = x text{ for all } x in S^{n-1}, then an isotopy connecting f to the identity is given by : J(x,t) = begin{cases} tf(x/t), & text{if } 0 leq x < t,  x, & text{if } t leq x leq 1. end{cases} Visually, the homeomorphism is 'straightened out' from the boundary, 'squeezing' f down to the origin. William Thurston calls this \\"combing all the tangles to one point\\". In the original 2-page paper, J. W. Alexander explains that for each t>0 the transformation J_t replicates f at a different scale, on the disk of radius t, thus as trightarrow 0 it is reasonable to expect that J_t merges to the identity. The subtlety is that at t=0, f \\"disappears\\": the germ at the origin \\"jumps\\" from an infinitely stretched version of f to the identity. Each of the steps in the homotopy could be smoothed (smooth the transition), but the homotopy (the overall map) has a singularity at (x,t)=(0,0). This underlines that the Alexander trick is a PL construction, but not smooth. General case: isotopic on boundary implies isotopic If f,gcolon D^n to D^n are two homeomorphisms that agree on S^{n-1}, then g^{-1}f is the identity on S^{n-1}, so we have an isotopy J from the identity to g^{-1}f. The map gJ is then an isotopy from g to f. Radial extension Some authors use the term Alexander trick for the statement that every homeomorphism of S^{n-1} can be extended to a homeomorphism of the entire ball D^n. However, this is much easier to prove than the result discussed above: it is called radial extension (or coning) and is also true piecewise-linearly, but not smoothly. Concretely, let fcolon S^{n-1} to S^{n-1} be a homeomorphism, then : Fcolon D^n to D^n text{ with } F(rx) = rf(x) text{ for all } r in [0,1) text{ and } x in S^{n-1} defines a homeomorphism of the ball. =Exotic spheres= The failure of smooth radial extension and the success of PL radial extension yield exotic spheres via twisted spheres.

Early life  Maria Teresa Francisca de Assis Ant√≥nia Carlota Joana Josefa Xavier de Paula Micaela Rafaela Isabel Gonzaga was born in Ajuda, Lisbon in 1793. As the eldest child of the heir to the Portuguese monarch, she was granted the title Princess of Beira (given to the son of the heir to the throne). Maria Teresa was the eldest daughter of King John VI of Portugal, then the heir-apparent of the reigning queen Maria I of Portugal, and his wife Carlota Joaquina, daughter of Charles IV of Spain.  Marriage  Portrait by Nicolas-Antoine Taunay, 1817. She was married on 13 May 1810 in Rio de Janeiro (where the royal family was exiled because of the Napoleonic wars) to her cousin Infante Pedro Carlos, Prince of Spain and Portugal. She was widowed on 26 May 1812, soon after giving birth to her only child, a son, Infante Sebastian of Portugal and Spain (1811‚Äì1875). Very conservative, she was an ally of her younger brother Miguel I of Portugal in his attempts to obtain the throne of Portugal (civil war 1826‚Äì1834), and of her brother-in-law and uncle Infante Don Carlos, Count of Molina in his attempts to obtain the Spanish throne. In the last years of the reign of her uncle Ferdinand VII of Spain (died 1833), Teresa lived in Madrid and plotted to strengthen Don Carlos' position in succession. She participated in the First Carlist War (1833‚Äì1839), being a leading supporter of Carlism, church and reactionary interests. Her sister Francisca, Titular Queen of Spain, wife of Carlos, died in 1834.  Spanish succession  On 15 January 1837, the Cortes of Spain legislated her excluded from the Spanish succession, rights belonging to her in descent from her mother, on grounds of her being a rebel along with Don Carlos. Her son Sebastian's rights were similarly excluded, but he was later, in 1859, restored in Spain. Also don Carlos' sons and Teresa's brother Miguel I of Portugal were excluded at the same law. The next year she married again, in 1838, to her brother-in-law, uncle and longtime ally, Infante Carlos of Spain (1788‚Äì1855), whom she viewed as the rightful king of Spain; the widower of her sister Maria Francisca. The second marriage remained childless, but she took care of her stepsons, who were also her nephews and cousins. They soon left Spain because of unsuccess in the civil war, and never returned. She died in Trieste on 17 January 1874, having survived her second husband by nineteen years.

Moses batted and threw left-handed, stood tall and weighed . He was born in Uvalda, Georgia and attended Vidalia High School.  Baseball career  Moses started his professional career with Galveston of the Texas League, where he batted .316 in 1934. He debuted with the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1935 season. He batted over .300 each of his seven years with them, with a career-best .345 in his sophomore year. Moses had by far his most productive season in 1937, when he hit career-highs in home runs (25), RBI (86), runs (113), hits (208) and doubles (48), batting .320 with 13 triples. In 1939, he missed a World Series opportunity when his trade to the Detroit Tigers for Benny McCoy was nullified by Baseball Commissioner K.M. Landis. The verdict made several Tigers free agents. Through years of last place finishes with Philadelphia, Moses had little chance to display his speed on the basepaths. But in 1943, with the Chicago White Sox, he posted a career-high 56 stolen bases and co-led the American League in triples (12). A strong-armed right fielder, he led the AL in putouts (329) in 1945. In the 1946 World Series with the Boston Red Sox, Moses hit .417 (5-for-12) and tied a WS record with four hits in a game. He finished his career with the Athletics in 1951. His first 7 years with the A's (1935-1941) were the most productive in his career. Moses surpassed .300 in every season. He posted 61 home runs, 354 rbi, and hit .317 (1135-for-3580). After being traded away after the 1941 season, he never hit .300 again and his productivity declined, posting 28 home runs, 325 rbi, and batting .266 (1003-for-3776) over the next 10 seasons with the White Sox and Red Sox and the A's again. The closest he came to the .300 plateau is when he hit .295 with the White Sox in 1945. His second tenure with the A's (1949-1951) was not even close to the numbers he put up with them at the beginning of his career. In a 17-season career, Moses hit .291 with 89 home runs and 679 RBI in 2012 games played. He added 1,124 runs, 2,138 hits, 435 doubles, 110 triples and 174 stolen bases. His career fielding percentage was .973. A patient hitter with a good eye, Moses collected a 1.80 walk-to- strikeout ratio (821-to-457). He also made the American League All-Star team in 1937 and 1945.  Post career  Following his playing career, Moses was a coach for the Athletics (1952‚Äì54, the A's final three seasons in Philadelphia), Philadelphia Phillies (1955‚Äì58), Cincinnati Reds (1959‚Äì60), New York Yankees (1961‚Äì62; 1966) and Detroit Tigers (1967‚Äì70), serving as both a first base coach and hitting instructor. He also was a minor league batting coach and scout for the Yankees. Moses died in Vidalia, Georgia two days after his 80th birthday. Moses was the last 20th century Athletics player with a 200-hit season. He had 208 in 1937. Sixty-five years later, Miguel Tejada collected 204 (October 5, ).

Historic settlement Archeological excavations carried out in 1981 to the south of the present village revealed the site of a Romano-British settlement.The Romano-British settlement at Ravenstone Evidence for iron smelting was found, along with kilns and coins dating from the late 3rd century.

The first documentary evidence of the existence of the village is in the Domesday Book when Donisthorpe, a manor in Derbyshire, was owned by Nigel of Stafford and it was valued at twelve pence.The Domesday Book Its name, which is derived from the Old Norse Hr≈ìfnes, the name of a Saxon invader, and the suffix t≈´n, meaning \\"Hrafn's farm or village\\", suggests that the settlement was probably initiated by the Anglo Saxons.Watts, Victor et al., (2004) The Cambridge Dictionary of Place Names, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. Ravenstone, December 2009. A castle, most probably consisting of an earth mound and ditch surrounded by a wooden palisade, is documented in a treaty concluded between 1147 and 1153 by the Earls of Chester and Leicester, in which it was agreed for it to be destroyed since it threatened their respective estates. The exact site of the castle has so far never been established, but it may have stood on the north side of the village on or near the site of Ravenstone Hall. The parish church of St Michael and All Angels is situated on the northern fringe of the village and dates from 1323. The church is of sandstone believed to have been quarried at nearby Alton, one of the two abandoned villages in the parish. Alton means \\"old farm\\", suggesting that it had been established before Ravenstone.

Knowledge of mode of reproduction is also essential for its artificial manipulation to breed improved types. Only those breeding and selection methods are suitable for a crop which does not interfere with its natural state or ensure the maintenance of such a state. It is due to such reasons that imposition of self-fertilization on cross-pollinating crops leads to drastic reduction in their performance. For teaching purpose, plant breeding is presented as four categories: Line breeding (autogamous crops), population breeding (allogamous crops), hybrid breeding (mostly allogamous crops, some autogamous crops), clone breeding (vegetatively propagated crops).  Self fertilizing crops (autogamous crops)  Certain restrictions caused the mechanisms for self-fertilization (partial and full self-fertilization) to develop in a number of plant species. Some of the reasons why a self- fertilizing method of reproduction is so effective are the efficacy of reproduction, as well as decreasing genetic variation and thus the fixation of highly adapted genotypes. Almost no inbreeding depression occurs in self- fertilizing plants because the mode of reproduction allows natural selection to take place in wild populations of such plants. Critical steps in the improvement of self-fertilizing crops are the choice of parents and the identification of the best plants in segregating generations. The breeder should also have definite goals with the choice of parents. Self-fertilizing are easier to maintain, but this could lead to misuse of seed. Some of the agronomy important, self-fertilizing crops include wheat, rice, barley, dry beans, soy beans, peanuts, tomatoes, etc. Mass selection This method of selection depends mainly on the selection of plants according to their phenotype and performance. The seed from selected plants is bulked for the next generation. This method is used to improve the overall population by positive or negative mass selection. Mass selection is only applied to a limited degree in self-fertilizing plants and is an effective method for the improvement of land races. This method of selection will only be effective for highly heritable traits. One shortage of mass selection is the large influence that the environment has on the development, phenotype, and performance of single plants. This can also be an advantage in that varieties can be selected for local performance. Stratified mass selection for ear size over 22 cycles has drastically altered plant phenotype in the maize population Zacatecas 58. Plants in the C22 cycle were 50 cm taller had twice the leaf area index, reached anthesis 7 days later and had a 30% higher harvest index than C0 (Table 1) Differences in growth were detected early in ontogeny. The root growth of C22 exceeded that of C0 and the ratio of shoot dry mass to root dry mass was reduced by nearly 12%, from 8.0¬±0.2 to 7.1¬±0.1 (Table 2). Analysis of yield components revealed that C22 was superior to C0 in grain weight, number of rows per ear, number of grains per row, and total yield per unit area (Table 3). Because the two genotypes were phenologically different, planting density optima are probably different for each population.  Selection of cross-pollinated crops  Plant species where normal mode of seed set is through a high degree of cross-pollination have characteristic reproductive features and population structure. Existence of self-sterility, self- incompatibility, imperfect flowers, and mechanical obstructions make the plant dependent upon foreign pollen for normal seed set. Each plant receives a blend of pollen from a large number of individuals each having different genotypes. Such populations are characterized by a high degree of heterozygosity with tremendous free and potential genetic variation, which is maintained in a steady state by free gene flow among individuals within the populations. In the development of hybrid varieties, the aim is to identify the most productive heterozygote from the population, which then is produced with the exclusion of other members of the population. =Mass selection= It is the simplest, easiest and oldest method of selection where individual plants are selected based on their phenotypic performance, and bulk seed selection proved to be quite effective in maize improvement at the initial stages but its efficacy especially for improvement of yield, soon came under severe criticism that culminated in the refinement of the method of mass selection. The selection after pollination does not provide any control over the pollen parent as result of which effective selection is limited only to female parents. The heritability estimates are reduced by half, since only parents are used to harvest seed whereas the pollen source is not known after the cross pollination has taken place. =Recurrent selection= This type of selection is a refined version of the mass selection procedure and differs as follows: * Visually selected individuals out of the base population undergo progeny testing * Individuals selected on basis of the progeny test data are crossed with each other in every possible way to produce seed to form the new base population. =Half-sib selection with progeny testing= Selections are made based on progeny test performance instead of phenotypic appearance of the parental plants. Seed from selected half-sibs, which have been pollinated by random pollen from the population (meaning that only the female parent is known and selected, hence the term \\"half-sib\\") is grown in unreplicated progeny rows for the purpose of selection. A part of the seed is planted to determine the yielding ability, or breeding value, for any character of each plant. The seed from the most productive rows or remnant seed from the outstanding half-sibs is bulked to complete one cycle of selection. =Full- sib selection with progeny testing= A number of full-sib families, each produced by making crosses between the two plants from the base population are evaluated in replicated trials. A part of each full-sib family is saved for recombination. Based on evaluation the remnant seed of selected full-sib families is used to recombine the best families. Breeding of asexually propagated crops Asexual reproduction covers all those modes of multiplication of plants where normal gamete formation and fertilization does not take place making these distinctly different from normal seed production crops. In the absence of sexual reproduction, the genetic composition of plant material being multiplied remains essentially the same as its source plant. Clones of mother plants can be made with the exact genetic composition of the mother plant. Superior plants are selected and propagated vegetatively; the vegetative propagated offspring are used to develop stable varieties without any deterioration due to segregation of gene combinations. This unique characteristic of asexual reproduction helped to develop a number of cultivars of fruits and vegetables including grapes, apples, pears and peaches. =Improving asexual plant material through selection= The selection in these crops is restricted to the material introduced from other sources, such as field plantations. The improvement of asexually propagated plants through induced mutations has distinct advantages and limitations. Any vegetative propagule can be treated with mutagens and even a single desirable mutant or a part of a mutated propagule (chimera) can be multiplied as an improved type of the original variety. =Selection of asexual plants= Selection, in the case of asexual plants, can be defined as the selection of the best performing plant and the vegetative propagation thereof. Because plants are not totally genetically stable, it can be expected that deviations would occur through the years. Selection is thus an ongoing process where deviants are selected or removed from the selection program. The main purpose of selection is to better the quality and yield of forthcoming plantations. Different approaches can be followed in the selection process of asexual plants, such as mass selection and clone selection from clone blocks. In mass selection there are some factors that must be considered when selecting plants in a mother block, e.g. vineyard. Time of selection is a big factor, because you have to select when most of the characteristics of the plant are clearly showing. With asexual perennials the best time is just before harvest. For the best results the selected plant must be evaluated during the next season, when growth- abnormalities, leave disfigurations and virus symptoms are best visualized. Mass selection is done annually on the same plant for a minimum of three years. A plant that does not conform to the requirements in any given year of the selection cycle is discarded from the program. New clone development The development and registration of new clones take place by means of local clone selection in old plantations, as well as the importation of high quality clones from abroad, for local evaluation. A clone is the vegetative offspring of one specific mother plant; it does not show any genetic, morphologic or physiologic deviations from the mother plant. Evaluation takes place with the different selected clones after selection. See also * Genomics of domestication References *CHAHAL, G.S & GOSAL, S.S., 2002.

Rosati became the third Italian player to play in a game in the NHL after earning an Italian passport and playing for Italy, after Bob Manno and Roberto Romano. Early years As a youth, Rosati played in the 1981 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Wexford, Toronto. Rosati started his career by playing in the Ontario Hockey League and was soon drafted by the New York Rangers in 1988 NHL Entry Draft (#131 pick). Rosati was initially placed in the ECHL, but after a disappointing season, decided to play in Italy. Rosati would find much more success there, and played for the Hockey Club Bolzano. In the 1990s Rosati would lead Bolzano to two Italian Hockey Championships, and would earn himself the place of goaltender for the Italian national team that would go on to compete in the 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics. The 1990s and the NHL experience By the second half of the 1990s, the Italian hockey movement had gone through a difficult period, and Rosati moved to Germany. It was here that Rosati played for Adler Mannheim of the DEL. In 1998, after two seasons of consistent play with Adler Mannheim, Rosati signed with the Washington Capitals as the third goaltender of the team, behind Olaf K√∂lzig and Craig Billington. After the shift to the farm team Portland Pirates, it seemed that Rosati's chances to play in the NHL were fading away, and that he was destined to spend his career in the minor leagues, but an injury to Craig Billington put him directly on the bench. On November 7, 1998, the incumbent Capitals goalie, Olaf K√∂lzig, suffered an injury, and Rosati made his NHL debut against the Ottawa Senators in a match won by the Capitals 8‚Äì5. Rosati played 28 minutes and didn't allow a goal. His NHL saves total stands at 12. He finished the season with the Manitoba Moose of the IHL. Despite a less than stellar stint with the Moose, Rosati decided to come back to Mannheim where he played four more seasons. Retirement and coaching Rosati retired in 2004 while playing for a German second division team. In the 2004‚Äì05 season, Rosati was the Adler Mannheim assistant coach and worked with St√©phane Richer and Helmut de Raaf (who played with Rosati for multiple seasons). He is currently the goaltending coach of the Vegas Golden Knights in the NHL. In the off season, Mike lives a calm life in Niagara Falls with this partner, Amy and her two children, Keiran and Kara.

Stamp for the British post office in Tangier, 1927. 1957 stamp for Tangier celebrating the 100th anniversary of the post office. The British post offices in Morocco, also known as the \\"Morocco Agencies\\", were a system of post offices operated by Gibraltar and later the United Kingdom in Morocco. First office The first office was established in Tangier in 1857; mail was simply bagged there and forwarded to Gibraltar just across the water, where it received the standard \\"A26\\" postmark. From 1872 Tangier had its own postmark, but this was applied alongside the stamps (allowing for the Gibraltar cancellation to mark them), so usages of British stamps from Morocco are best determined on cover. Several examples of loose GB Queen Victoria stamps cancelled Tangier do exist including at least one horizontal strip of 6 1d reds from plate 123.This item was lot 417 in the H R Harmer sale on December 12‚Äì14, 1960. Since the offices were under the control of Gibraltar, they switched to the use of Gibraltar stamps when they came into use, 1 January 1886. Additional offices opened in various Moroccan seaports during the 1880s, and inland at Fez (1892), and Meknes (1907). The stamps were overprinted \\"Morocco / Agencies\\" beginning in 1898, initially at the offices of the Gibraltar Chronicle,Gibbons Stamp Weekly, Volume 8, Stanley Gibbons, 1908, page 23 and then later in London, yielding several variations in the appearance of the overprint. Direct control On 1 January 1907, the British Post Office took direct control of the post offices, operating them until Moroccan independence in 1956. From that point on, all stamps were overprints on British issues, in no less than three different currencies.https://web.archive.org/web/20180812152446/http://www.stampworldhistory.com/country- profiles-2/africa/morocco/ Retrieved 12 August 2018. British-currency stamps were available at any office, and primarily intended for parcels and, later, airmail. Both regular and some commemorative issues were overprinted, all with \\"MOROCCO / AGENCIES\\", up to the Edward VIII issue of 1936. Subsequently, unoverprinted stamps were used, until 1949, when they were again overprinted for use at Tetuan (at that point the sole remaining office, except for Tangier, which had its own overprints). Spanish currency stamps Spanish- currency stamps were also available at all offices until the establishment of the French Zone, after which they were limited to the Spanish Zone. The overprint was basically the same as for the British-currency stamps, with the added complication of needing to fit in the denomination in Centimos and Pesetas. All types of British stamps were overprinted, the last being the issues of Elizabeth II in the summer of 1956; all were withdrawn from sale 31 December of that year. French currency stamps French-currency stamps, intended for use in the French Zone, date from 1917, and continued in use until 8 January 1938, when they were withdrawn from sale. The overprints are just as for the Spanish currency, but fewer types were produced. Tangier The Tangier International Zone received its own overprints beginning in 1927. As British currency was in use in that office, the overprint simply reads \\"TANGIER\\". This continued through 1956. On 1 April 1957, a commemorative overprint added \\"1857-1957\\" to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the post office, but this had a very short shelf life; the office at Tangier was closed and the stamps withdrawn from sale on 30 April 1957. Philatelic literature The most substantial book on the Morocco Agencies, by Dr David A. Stotter, Chairman of the GB Overprints Society (GBOS), was published in October 2007 by the Postal History Society (PHS) and the British Philatelic Trust (BPT), 367 pp, hardbound, price ¬£49. Entitled \\"The British Post Office Service in Morocco 1907-57\\" it covers in great depth the postal history of the so-called British Period, from the transfer of control to the GPO from Gibraltar in January 1907 to the closure of the Tangier post office in April 1957. This book was awarded the RPSL Crawford Medal and a Large Gold at Harrogate 2008.Further details from johndc.sussex@btinternet.com representing the Postal History Society (PHS). See also the GBOS website, http://www.gbos.org.uk or The first booklet on the Morocco Agencies, written by John H Vallis was published by H F Johnson in 1921. The second was written by R H Sampson, and was published by the Royal Philatelic Society London in 1959 in a limited edition of 250 copies. Subsequent to that the late Dr Ken Clough produced 2 booklets (the second being a revised version of the first) published by the Gibraltar Study Circle in 1978 and 1984. The G B Overprints Society (GBOS) also published in 1992 a booklet specifically on the Overprinted GB issues of Edward VII written by M H Gellatly & M K Wlodarczyk.

He then managed the national team for two years in 1975 and 1976 before moving to the NASL in the United States.  Early days  Dave attended Larne Grammar School and excelled at both football and rugby union, during his time at the school he earned football caps for the national team at schoolboy, youth and amateur level. As a junior, he played for the Larne suburban team of Millbrook before signing for Irish league club Portadown F.C. in 1961. After starring in a 2‚Äì0 Irish amateur win over Wales in January 1963 he signed for English Division One club Wolverhampton Wanderers.Northern Ireland's Football Greats. Gives details of early days.  English league career  Dave Clements' spell as an apprentice at Wolverhampton Wanderers lasted for just over a year, however in that time he failed to break into the first team. =Coventry City= Despite this lack of success at Wolves, he caught the eye of Coventry City manager Jimmy Hill who paid ¬£1,500 for the 18-year-old at the start of the 1964‚Äì65 season. Clements made a fine start to his City career, scoring on his debut on 23 January 1965 against Northampton Town and netting eight times in his first ten matches. Two months later on 17 March 1965, aged just 19, he earned the first of his 48 caps for the Northern Ireland national team against the Netherlands. Clements was an integral part of the Coventry side which won the Second Division championship in the 1966‚Äì67 season and then did well in the top flight. He played as an outside left for much of his time at Coventry for whom he made 228 league appearances (255 including cup games) and scored 30 goals in total over a period of seven seasons. Throughout his time at Highfield Road he continued to be a regular for the Northern Ireland team, earning 21 caps in total while with the Midlands team. His most famous moment as an international player came in October 1967 when he scored the winning goal in a Euro 68 qualifier against Scotland at Windsor Park. Coventry manager Noel Cantwell surprisingly agreed to let Clements move on after six-years at the club and after rejecting a move to Hull City in February 1971, he moved to Sheffield Wednesday in August of the same year as part of a combined deal that also included Brian Joicey and cost the Yorkshire club ¬£100,000.www.cwn.org.uk.

Dave was made club captain for 1974‚Äì75, a season in which Everton were well placed to lift the First Division championship before a late slump let in Derby County. In total, Clements made 85 league appearances in his time with Everton scoring six goals (he took over as the clubs penalty taker) and became one of the most respected midfielders in the top flight. During his time at Everton he became player-manager of the Northern Ireland national side for a short time taking over from Terry Neill in 1975 and being replaced by Danny Blanchflower in 1976.Career Info www.sporting-heroes.net. Gives career statistics. Manager career Dave Clements tenure as Northern Ireland manager lasted for eleven matches, he took over in the winter of 1974‚Äì75, part way through the qualification matches for Euro 76. He took over as manager at the age of only 29 and his first game as manager was on 16 March 1975 and was a Euro 76 qualifier against Yugoslavia in Belfast. This was the first time that Northern Ireland had played a home match in the province since 1971 and resulted in a fine 1‚Äì0 victory which put the Northern Irish in with a chance of qualification. However a home defeat to Sweden in October 1975 and a loss in Belgrade to Yugoslavia in the final group qualifier the following month stopped Northern Ireland progressing to the last eight knock out stage. Dave Clements continued as manager into 1976, however results were disappointing culminating in Northern Ireland losing all three matches in the British Home Championship in May of that year. They lost heavily to Scotland 0‚Äì3 in Glasgow and to England 0‚Äì4 at Wembley before losing 0‚Äì1 to Wales in Swansea. The Welsh defeat was Dave Clements last game as both manager and player for the national team on 14 May 1976.www.northernirelandyears.com. Gives details of period as Northern Ireland manager. He played his last game for Everton in February 1976 and moved to the United States, having received a lucrative offer to play in the NASL for New York Cosmos where he played alongside Pel√©. His performances for Cosmos during 1976 ensured that Clements was named in the All-Star Honourable Mention Team for that year, he was also selected for Team America to participate in the Bicentenary Cup against Italy, Brazil and England.

The poem was published, under the title \\"A Christmas Carol\\", in the January 1872 issue of Scribner's Monthly, and was first collected in book form in Goblin Market, The Prince's Progress and Other Poems (Macmillan, 1875). The poem first appeared set to music in The English Hymnal in 1906 with a setting by Gustav Holst. Harold Darke's anthem setting of 1911 is more complex and was named the best Christmas carol in a poll of some of the world's leading choirmasters and choral experts in 2008. It is quoted throughout the Peaky Blinders TV series. Text As first published in Scribner's Monthly (January 1872) In the bleak mid-winter Frosty wind made moan; Earth stood hard as iron, Water like a stone; Snow had fallen, snow on snow, Snow on snow, In the bleak mid-winter Long ago. Our God, heaven cannot hold Him Nor earth sustain, Heaven and earth shall flee away When He comes to reign: In the bleak mid-winter A stable-place sufficed The Lord God Almighty ‚Äî Jesus Christ. Enough for Him, whom cherubim Worship night and day, A breastful of milk And a mangerful of hay; Enough for Him, whom Angels Fall down before, The ox and ass and camel Which adore. Angels and Archangels May have gathered there, Cherubim and seraphim Thronged the air; But only His Mother In her maiden bliss Worshipped the Beloved With a kiss. What can I give Him, Poor as I am? ‚Äî If I were a Shepherd I would bring a lamb; If I were a Wise Man I would do my part, ‚Äî Yet what I can I give Him, ‚Äî Give my heart. Analysis In verse one, Rossetti describes the physical circumstances of the Incarnation in Bethlehem. In verse two, Rossetti contrasts Christ's first and second coming. The third verse dwells on Christ's birth and describes the simple surroundings, in a humble stable and watched by beasts of burden. Rossetti achieves another contrast in the fourth verse, this time between the incorporeal angels attendant at Christ's birth with Mary's ability to render Jesus physical affection. The final verse shifts the description to a more introspective thought process. Hymnologist and theologian Ian Bradley has questioned the poem's theology: \\"Is it right to say that heaven cannot hold God, nor the earth sustain, and what about heaven and earth fleeing away when he comes to reign?\\" However, I Kings 8.27, in Solomon's prayer of dedication of the Temple, says: \\"But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you.\\" Regarding \\"heaven and earth fleeing away\\", many New Testament apocalyptic passages use such language, principally Revelation 20. 11 \\"And I saw a great white throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them\\" (KJV). Similar language is used in II Peter 3. 10-11: \\"The heavens will disappear with a roar, the elements will be destroyed by fire... That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells\\" (NIV). Settings The text of this Christmas poem has been set to music many times. Two of the most famous settings were composed by Gustav Holst and Harold Edwin Darke in the early 20th century. =Holst= \\"Cranham\\", by Gustav Holst relative { key f major time 4/4 a'4. bes8 c4 a % (text after the % is just a comment) g2 f4 r g4. a8 g4 d g2. r4 } addlyrics { In the bleak mid -- win -- ter, Fros -- ty wind made moan, } Holst's setting, Cranham, is a hymn tune setting suitable for congregational singing, since the poem is irregular in metre and any setting of it requires a skilful and adaptable tune. The hymn is titled after Cranham, Gloucestershire and was written for the English Hymnal of 1906. =Darke= transpose c bes, relative { key g major time 4/4 b'4. a8 d4 b % (text after the % is just a comment) g2 fis2 e4. fis8 g4 e d1 } addlyrics { In the bleak mid -- win -- ter, Fros -- ty wind made moan, } The Darke setting, was written in 1909 while he was a student at the Royal College of Music. Although melodically similar, it is more advanced; each verse is treated slightly differently, with solos for soprano and tenor (or a group of sopranos and tenors) and a delicate organ accompaniment. This version is favoured by cathedral choirs and is the one usually heard performed on the radio broadcasts of Nine Lessons and Carols by the King's College Choir. Darke served as conductor of the choir during World War II. Darke omits verse four of Rossetti's original, and bowdlerizes Rossetti's \\"a breastful of milk\\" to \\"a heart full of mirth\\", although later editions reversed this change. Darke also repeats the last line of the final verse. Darke would complain, however, that the popularity of this tune prevented people from performing his other compositions, and rarely performed it outside of Christmas services.Galaxy Music Corporation: In the Bleak Midwinter by Harold Darke arr. Ronald Arnatt The Darke setting was used in Jacob Collier's rearrangement of the song, which was released on YouTube on 14 December 2016. The rearrangement by Collier features contemporary compositional techniques such as microtonality. =Other settings= Benjamin Britten includes an elaborate five-part setting of the first verse for high voices (combined with the medieval Corpus Christi Carol) in his work A Boy was Born. Other settings include those by Robert C L Watson, Bruce Montgomery, Bob Chilcott, Michael John Trotta, Robert Walker, Eric Thiman, who wrote a setting for solo voice and piano, and Leonard Lehrman.

The IEEE 802.11u standard was published on February 25, 2011.  Some amendments added to IEEE 802.11  = Network discovery and selection = # Provides for the discovery of suitable networks (preassociation) through the advertisement of access network type {private network, free public network, for-fee public network}, roaming consortium, and venue information. # Generic Advertisement Service (GAS), which provides for Layer 2 transport of an advertisement protocol's frames between a mobile device and a server in the network prior to authentication. The access point is responsible for the relay of a mobile device's query to a server in the carrier's network and for delivering the server's response back to the mobile. # Provides Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP), which is a query and response protocol used by a mobile device to discover a range of information, including the hotspot operator's domain name (a globally unique, machine searchable data element); roaming partners accessible via the hotspot along with their credential type and EAP method supported for authentication; IP address type availability (for example, IPv4, IPv6); and other metadata useful in a mobile device's network selection process. = QoS map distribution = This provides a mapping between the IP's differentiated services code point (DSCP) to over-the-air Layer 2 priority on a per-device basis, facilitating end-to-end QoS. For users who are not pre-authorized IEEE 802.11 currently makes an assumption that a user's device is pre-authorized to use the network. IEEE 802.11u covers the cases where that device is not pre-authorized. A network will be able to allow access based on the user's relationship with an external network (e.g. hotspot roaming agreements), or indicate that online enrollment is possible, or allow access to a strictly limited set of services such as emergency services (client to authority and authority to client.) From a user perspective, the aim is to improve the experience of a traveling user who turns on a laptop in a hotel many miles from home, or uses a mobile device to place a phone call. Instead of being presented with a long list of largely meaningless SSIDs the user could be presented with a list of networks, the services they provide, and the conditions under which the user could access them. 802.11u is central to the adoption of UMA and other approaches to network mobile devices.  Encourages mesh deployment  Because a relatively sophisticated set of conditions can be presented, arbitrary contracts could be presented to the user, and might include providing information on motive, demographics or geographic origin of the user. As such data is valuable to tourism promotion and other public functions, 802.11u is thought to motivate more extensive deployment of IEEE 802.11s mesh networks.  Mobile cellular network off- load to Wi-Fi  Mobile users, whose devices can move between 3G and Wi-Fi networks at a low level using 802.21 handoff, also need a unified and reliable way to authorize their access to all of those networks. 802.11u provides a common abstraction that all networks regardless of protocol can use to provide a common authentication experience. = Mandatory requirements = The IEEE 802.11u requirements specification contains requirements in the areas of enrollment, network selection, emergency call support, emergency alert notification, user traffic segmentation, and service advertisement. Implementation =Hotspot 2.0= The Wi-Fi Alliance uses IEEE 802.11u in its \\"Wi-Fi Certified Passpoint\\" program, also known as \\"Hotspot 2.0\\". Apple devices running iOS 7 support Hotspot 2.0. =EAP-TLS= There have been proposals to use IEEE 802.11u for access points to signal that they allow EAP- TLS using only server-side authentication. Unlike most TLS implementations of HTTPS, such as major web browsers, the majority of implementations of EAP-TLS require client-side X.509 certificates without giving the option to disable the requirement, even though the standard does not mandate their use, which some have identified as having the potential to dramatically reduce adoption of EAP-TLS and prevent \\"open\\" but encrypted access points.

Hahn has won multiple distinguished awards, notably the National Prize for Literature (Chile) and the Pablo Neruda Ibero-American Poetry Award.  Biography  = Early life = Oscar Hahn is the son of Ralph Hahn Vald√©s and Enriqueta Garc√©s S√°nchez. He lost his father at the young age of 4 years old on 28 March 1943. His first traces to poetry began in his adolescence in Rancagua, Chile. After falling in love during a childhood relationship, Hahn felt compelled to write his first poems. He received his primary and secondary education in Iquique, Chile at the Don Bosco Salesian College and the Lyceum of Men. Hahn later attended the University of Chile where he graduated as a professor of Spanish. = Career = Hahn receiving an award from president Sebasti√°n Pi√±era. In 1959, while at the University of Chile, he won the Student Federation of Chile's Prize in Poetry. In 1961, at only 22 years old, he won the Society of Chilean Writers' Alerce Prize for the work This Black Rose (Esta Rosa Negra). In 1967 he won the Unique Prize of the First Contest in Northern Poetry of the University of Chile for the (then) regional seat of Antofagasta. He studied and set himself to the University of Chile's Curriculum in the Teaching of Literature while in residence at Arica. In 1972 he was awarded the degree of Master of Arts by the University of Iowa, US and was named a member of the International Writers' Program there. In 1972, when he returned to Chile, he took a job as Adjunct Professor at the University of Chile, Arica. In the next year, 1973, his life would change dramatically, due to political developments in his home country; on September 11 of that year, during the Chilean coup of 1973 he was detained by the newly installed military government of Augusto Pinochet, which had displaced the progressive government of the democratically elected leader Salvador Allende. Hahn's book, Love's Disease was the only poetry book that was banned during the dictatorship. Later interviewed about his experiences, Hahn remarked: \\"September 11 is a difficult date for me to forget, not only on account of the things that happened in the country at large but also because they took me prisoner, and they took me as a prisoner the very same night of September 11, which was deadly serious, since in that very moment they were just killing people without even asking them their names, just totally at random. It was a lottery, and I believe that I'm alive thanks to sheer chance, because there were people who were detained with me and they shot them dead; this could just as well happened to me.\\" Hahn left Chile in 1974 to set down new roots in the USA. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the University of Maryland College Park, and between 1978 and 1988 he collaborated in the composition of the Handbook of Latin American Studies issued by the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. In 1988, Hahn then moved to Iowa City, Iowa and began teaching at The University of Iowa. In 2008, Hahn retired from teaching and moved back to Chile to focus more on his poetry. He is a member of the Chilean Academy of Language, and sat on the organizing committee for the Comit√©s del V Congreso Internacional de la Lengua Espa√±ola (CILE).

Discovery of the arm The tiger shark had been caught from the beach suburb of Coogee in mid-April and transferred to the Coogee Aquarium Baths, where it was put on public display. Within a week, it became ill and vomited in front of a small crowd, leaving the left hand and forearm of a man bearing a distinctive tattoo floating in the pool. Before it was captured, the tiger shark had devoured a smaller shark. It was this smaller shark that had originally swallowed the human arm.  Investigation  Fingerprints lifted from the hand identified the arm as that of former boxer and small-time criminal James \\"Jim\\" Smith (born England, 1890), who had been missing since 7 April 1935. Smith's arm and tattoo were also positively identified by his wife, Gladys Smith, and his brother, Edward Smith. Smith led a high-risk lifestyle, as he was also a police informer. Examination revealed that the limb had been severed with a knife, which led to a murder investigation. Three days later, the aquarium owners killed the shark and gutted it, hampering the initial police investigation. Early inquiries correctly led police to a Sydney businessman named Reginald William Lloyd Holmes (1892‚Äì1935). Holmes was a fraudster and smuggler who also ran a successful family boat-building business at Lavender Bay, New South Wales.Sydney Morning Herald. \\"Holmes family - New Zealand Boatbuilders.\\" 14 June 1935 (page 11) Holmes had employed Smith several times to work insurance scams, including one in 1934 in which an over- insured pleasure cruiser named Pathfinder was sunk near Terrigal, New South Wales. Shortly afterwards, the pair began a racket with Patrick Francis Brady (1889‚Äì1965), an ex-serviceman and convicted forger. With specimen signatures from Holmes' friends and clients provided by the boat-builder, Brady would forge cheques for small amounts against their bank accounts that he and Smith then cashed. Police were later able to establish that Smith had been blackmailing Holmes. Smith was last seen drinking and playing cards with Patrick Francis Brady at the Cecil Hotel in the southern Sydney suburb of Cronulla on 7 April 1935 after telling his wife he was going fishing.Whiticker, Alan Twelve Crimes That Shocked the Nation 2005 Brady had rented a small cottage in Taloombi Street, Cronulla at the time Smith went missing. Police alleged that Smith was murdered at this cottage. Port Hacking and Gunnamatta Bay were searched by the Navy and the Air Force, but the rest of Smith's body was never found. This caused problems for the prosecution when Brady was eventually brought to trial. Brady was arrested on 16 May and charged with the murder of Smith. A taxi driver testified that he had taken Brady from Cronulla to Holmes' address at 3 Bay View Street, McMahons Point, New South Wales, on the day Smith had gone missing, and that \\"he was dishevelled, he had a hand in a pocket and wouldn't take it out... it was clear that [he] was frightened.\\"The Shark Arm Case - \\"Dimensions in Time\\" ABC radio transcript Initially, Holmes denied any association with Brady but four days later, on 20 May 1935, the businessman went into his boatshed and attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head with a .32 calibre pistol. However, the bullet flattened against the bone of the forehead and he was merely stunned. Revived after falling into the water, he crawled into his speedboat and led two police launches on a chase around Sydney Harbour for several hours until he was finally caught and taken to hospital.Vince Kelly .The Shark Arm Case. Angus & Robertson Publishers, Australia. 1963 Second murder In early June 1935, Holmes decided to cooperate with the police in investigating the murder of Smith. He told Detective Sergeant Frank Matthews that Brady had killed Smith, dismembered his body and stowed it into a trunk that he had then thrown into Gunnamatta Bay. He then claimed Brady had come to his home, showed him the severed arm and threatened Holmes with murder if he did not receive ‚Ç§500 immediately. Holmes also admitted that after Brady had left his home, he travelled to the Sydney coastal suburb of Maroubra and discarded Smith's arm in the surf.Whiticker On 11 June 1935, Holmes withdrew ‚Ç§500 from his account and late in the evening left home, telling his wife he had to meet someone. He was also very cautious as he left his home, accompanied by his wife to the door of his Nash sedan. Early the next morning, he was found dead in his car at Hickson Road, Dawes Point. He had been shot three times at close range.Sydney Morning Herald. \\"MURDERED IN CAR - Principal Witness in Aquarium Mystery Inquest\\". 12 June 1935. (page 13) The crime scene was made to appear that Holmes had committed suicide, but forensic police had no doubt that he was murdered.

The lawyer serving Brady, Clive Evatt KC (1900‚Äì1984), claimed to the coroner that there was not enough substance to begin the inquest.

Brauer has since developed into a large secondary school with an enrolment of approximately 850 students ranging from years 7 to 12. The school is known for both outstanding curricular and extra curricular activities, including consistently high VCE results and outstanding levels of success in public speaking, performing arts and sporting areas. Boyle has been principal of the College since 2012. The school council president is Darren Hancy.  Campuses  Brauer's main campus is located on Carumut Road, towards the outskirts of Warrnambool's urban area. The school features a state of the art performing arts centre and gymnasium, as well as extensive classroom and other facilities including a driver education track and supergrass tennis courts. In 2007 the library and science wing were refurbished in addition to the construction of the Australian Technical College Warrnambool campus. Directly north of the school, a multimillion-dollar sports facility known as Brauerander Park has been built. The park features an athletics track as well as planned facilities for field events, soccer & AFL football fields and a 3-hole golf course. The track was completed in mid-May 2007 and was officially opened by the Victorian Governor, Professor David de Kretser in September 2007. Dunkeld Annexe The Dunkeld Annexe is a Brauer owned facility located in Dunkeld, in the southern Grampians, used for the purpose of school camps. Years 7 and 8 camping trips take place here where the accessibility to outdoor education is one of its many benefits.  Notable events  In 2007, the college received extended media attention regarding its unique \\"two brick rule\\". The rule, which stated that students of the opposite gender could not come within two brick lengths of each other was designed to minimise sexual contact and unplanned pregnancy which was rampant in the school at the time. This was perceived by students at the time as an extension of the school council's endorsement of the homosexual regime, as it appeared that the school was banning heterosexual contact in order to increase the number of students who were outwardly gay. Meanwhile, other schools in the region questioned why the unit of measurement was \\"bricks\\" rather than simply the length of a ruler. As a result, local parents began to believe that the school did not use SI units and were instead using rudimentary units of length leading to the eventual scrapping of the rule.  Extra curricular  Aside from the school's curricular achievements, Brauer is also well known within both the Warrnambool and wider community for its success in extra curricular activities. Public speaking Brauer has a very strong and long tradition in the art of public speaking and debating. All students are taught the skills to participate in public speaking. The school has long associations with the Warrnambool Eisteddfod, public speaking and debating competitions run by the Rostrum Club, the Lions Club, the Legacy Group, the Apex Club, the VCAA Plain English Speaking Competition and the mooting competition run by Bond University. Brauer's success in these fields has been unmatched, with state and national finalists and champions in all aforementioned competitions. At Eisteddfod level, in 2006 Brauer had over 150 students compete with a high rate of success. In the debating section, Brauer won the overall aggregate for the 16th consecutive year, cementing the school's level of commitment and success. Brauer also participates in the Ballarat region of the Debaters Association of Victoria (DAV), where up to 30 students travel each round to participate, several debaters have previously won Swannie Awards for best debater and progressed to the state final debating rounds. Each year a team of senior public speaking students are chosen to take part in the Bond university mooting competition ‚Äì an exclusive competition in which Brauer is the only Victorian government school to have won the national title and one of only two schools to have won the competition twice. Music/performing arts Brauer's music and performing arts program is, like public speaking, a large part of the school's cohort. Annually, the Brauer musical comprises approximately 150 students as cast, band and backstage members. In 2006 the production was \\"Copacabana\\", with \\"We Will Rock You\\" in 2007. The musical has been an annual part of Brauer since 1984. Additionally, the Brauer Amateur Dramatics Club (or BAD) produce a non-musical, dramatic performance. Brauer also supports a number of bands, ensembles and musical solo performers with tuition enabling students to participate in the Warrnambool Eisteddfod and other prestigious music competitions. Around 300 students are involved with the music program. Sport Brauer is a major player in the sporting community. The college sports academy consists of 14 sports with students from years 7-12 participating. Academy teams compete against other schools and in larger competitions. House sports are also a major part of the school's sporting program. There are four houses: * Geefa (green) * Vesta (red) * Aurora (yellow) * Orion (blue) Members of each house participate annually for house championships in swimming, athletics, cross country and overall. In 2006, Geefa was house champion, with the 2007 championships still underway.  Industry Education Centre (formerly Australian Technical College Warrnambool)  In 2006, Brauer in partnership with Baimbridge College Hamiltion won the tender for the Australian Technical College in Warrnambool. Commencing its programs at the beginning of 2007, the ATCW offers courses in commercial cookery, mechanics, engineering, metal fabrication and carpentry. Following the federal election of Kevin Rudd and the ALP to power in 2007, the ATC project was discontinued. As the ATC Warrnambool campus was one of the few finished colleges in the state, it remained operational in various states until in 2009 it became the Industry Education Centre, jointly operated by South West Institute of TAFE, Brauer College & other local school and employment agency bodies.

They were one of the first French bands to attempt fusion rock. Early years The band originally formed in S√®vres, France under the name of Great Gangsters From The Dirty District (until they changed it to just Dirty District later). A vast majority of their songs were sung in English, except for the first EP and two songs on Pousse au crime et Longueurs de temps. Influenced by the likes of Joe Jackson, The Clash, Stiff Little Fingers, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Reggae, Ska and Rhythm and blues. They released the much delayed Pousse au crime et Longueurs de temps which were a fusion of reggae, ska, punk, dub, and rap with heavily political based lyrics based on street crime, Steve Biko and fighting the National Front. Pousse Au Crime.. was noticed by fellow French Punk/World Music band Mano Negra, and the band invited them to play on their album Patchanka. =1993 and onwards= After a whole host of musicians had been and gone, Dirty District finally got a steady line-up when they released their second album Life In The Dirty District in 1993. DD showed their eclectic roots yet again on this album, experimenting with elements of Rap Metal. During this time Kshoo, Philippe, Miguel and Charlu from 'Ludwig Von 88' started a little-known side project called Les Dieux (The Gods). After taking 2 years off (most members like Yvo, Philippe, Miguel had been contributing to other French musicians) DD released the final EP Welcome To The Next Level in 1995, which included a cover of The Prodigy's Jericho, and the song Speech Over which explored the sound that would later explode in Ethnician. The band disbanded in 1996. Vocalist K-Shoo went on to do co-vocals for metalcore group Boost and then formed another metalcore/punk-metal band called Noxious Enjoyment while Yvo nowadays plays live drums for Amadou & Mariam, Philippe is a London-based musician and producer, and bassist Leuji has now his own musical career, and performs in a band of the same name. Members * K-shoo: Kshoo is the vocalist and live guitarist. He also contributed vocals to Death Metal Band Boost and Punk supergroups Les Dieux, and finally his metalcore band Noxious Enjoyment. * Yvo Abadi (aka 'The Megasound') is the drummer and percussionist, who joined in 1993. Since leaving DD, Yvo has contributed drums and percussions to other artists. Was last seen playing drums at Glastonbury 2009 with Amadou & Mariam. * Philippe Lenzini (also known as Ifif) was the guitarist after Gille's departure. He played on the Life In The Dirty District and Welcome to the Next Level. He lives in London, has played and collaborated with various musicians including Youth, Dennis Morris, Klima, and has also been writing music for film. * Miguel Saboga is the second drummer and percussionist. He started drumming in The Brigades, and later does vocals on DD's song No Head, which led to him becoming the frontman of Ethnician. * Igor Nikitinsky is the sampler and keyboards player. He replaced Geo and also is in Ethnician. * Garbis Baharian did most of the sample and sound engineering on the first album, and also is in Ethnician.

Warren Reginald Cann (born 20 May 1950 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) Personal File : Warren Cann : April 1997 Date of birth: 20 May 1950 Place of birth: Victoria, British Columbia, Canada is a Canadian drummer and drum machine programmer, best known as a member of the British new wave band Ultravox. Biography =Early life= The son of two British immigrants, he began to be interested in electronics while he was at school. After playing in bands in Vancouver, he came to Britain in 1972, where he found a more creative environment. He established himself in London, where he formed his first band, along with Huw Lloyd-Langton, future Hawkwind member, on guitar and Rob Rawlinson, later in Overnight Angels, on bass. =Ultravox and other contemporary works= Shortly thereafter, Cann contacted John Foxx, who invited Cann to join his fledgling band Tiger Lily with bassist Chris Cross and guitarist Stevie Shears. The band recorded sole single \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\", which was released in 1975 and used as a main theme to the namesake softcore porno movie. In 1976, Tiger Lily changed its name to Ultravox!, and later in 1978 to Ultravox. Cann played on the first albums released by Island Records, Ultravox! (1977), Ha! Ha! Ha! (both 1977) and Systems of Romance (1978). After a tour of United States and Canada the band fragmented because of the departure of vocalist John Foxx and guitarist Robin Simon. Ultravox replaced them with singer/guitarist Midge Ure in Summer 1979. Ure-led Ultravox signed to Chrysalis in 1980 and went on to have a commercial success worldwide. Cann contributed lyrics to 2/3 of the first Ure-led album \\"Vienna\\", sang backing vocals, co-lead and lead on some Ultravox songs: \\"Mr. X\\" (1980), \\"Paths and Angles\\" (1981), \\"We Came to Dance\\" (1982) and \\"Break Your Back\\" (1983). He remained active outside the band during Ultravox success. In 1982 he played acoustic and electronic percussion for Zaine Griff (album \\"Figvres\\") and Peter Godwin (single \\"Images of Heaven\\"). He and Hans Zimmer were a part of the backing band for a New Romantic singer Ronny on her London show in The Dominion. Ronny also participated in the Helden project, formed by Cann and Zimmer that year, which merged electronic, orchestral and classical influences. Helden were the first music project to play The London Planetarium in March 1983. They released a single \\"Holding on\\" (1983) and recorded an album called \\"Spies\\" which featured many guests (Zaine Griff, Eddie Maelov from Eddie & Sunshine, Brian Robertson from Thin Lizzy etc.). It remains unreleased. In September 1984 Cann and Zimmer performed as guests (on drums and keyboards, respectively) on a concert by the Spanish band Mecano. Two songs from that show were released in 1985 on LP \\"En Concierto\\". Also in 1985 Cann produced a single for the eccentric singer Duffo, \\"Gonna Send the Boys Around\\", and took part in the Doctor Who charity single \\"Doctor in Distress\\". Cann's was ousted from the band in 1986, after the disagreements arose with other band members who started to consider him a problem in the progress of the band. Cann wanted a fully programmed percussion sound while the others preferred a \\"back-to-basics\\" approach. He also wished to become the second guitarist in the band. In his autobiography, Midge Ure later commented that in retrospect he considered the firing unjust, unwarranted, and a result of misplaced tensions.,If I Was... The Autobiography, by Midge Ure, Virgin Books describing Cann's dismissal as \\"cutting the band's jugular vein\\". Following his departure from Ultravox Cann recorded a solo demo which was turned down by Chrysalis Records. He did session work for other artists, including 7000 Danses by Indochine, appeared on several television shows with Kim Wilde and produced demos for aspiring bands. He joined a band called The Sons of Valentino, and then played guitar and keyboards with The Huw Lloyd- Langton Group. He later moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film scoring.Warren Cann Interview The Electricity Club Cann rejoined Ultravox over two decades later in 2008, reunited the classic lineup last seen at Live Aid in 1985. In April 2009 the band toured with \\"Return to Eden\\". In May 2012 the first studio album in 28 years by this lineup was released with the title Brilliant. Technical innovations Cann and his technicians were among the first to modify commercially available rhythm units or drum machines, so they could alter and override the preset manufacturer programs. This is notable on \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\", from the album Ha!-Ha!-Ha!. When Ultravox were recording Vienna, Cann's electronic ventures would become important for the Ultravox sound. The acquisition of a Roland CR-78 proved something of a headache for Cann, as he saw great sonic potential in it, but it had limited pattern programmability. In the process of adding some much needed practical customisations to the CR-78, Cann became somewhat persona non grata at the Roland headquarters in the UK. This did not stop Cann from carrying out his plans, and the result proved to be a key factor in the overall sound of their signature hit song \\"Vienna\\". The initial reaction to the usage of drum machines led to bewilderment among the audience, who wondered what Cann was doing during some songs. Among claims that he was doing nothing, he decided to equip his drum machines with clear perspex cases instead of wood panels, and mount a variety of LEDs inside them as a feature Cann himself described as \\"absolutely useless, but very impressive looking on a darkened stage; now it would be obvious I was actually doing something.\\" (From Jonas W√•rstad's interview at Discog) In addition to his drum machine work, Cann designed several modifications for bass player Chris Cross' Minimoog, among them a primitive sequencer (built by Roy Gwinn) made from a series of toggle switches to add syncopation to the synthesiser's ability to create a stream of eighth notes, and a proprietary triggering system that allowed Cann and Cross to synchronise the Minimoog with Cann's drum machines, a feat performed almost three years before MIDI was officially introduced in 1983. According to Midge Ure's autobiography, when the Minimoog broke down on tour, Ultravox borrowed one from The Cars, but it didn't help as it lacked the proprietary modifications. Playing style In the spring of 1978, when Ultravox released the Systems of Romance album, Cann's style of drumming turned away from its rock roots and toward what was becoming the New Wave sound. He endeavoured to have extremely precise timing; this would make the songs with live drums match songs driven by electronic, programmed percussion. For an example of this, compare the song \\"Sleepwalk\\", where Cann plays live drums, to \\"Mr. X\\", where the drums are sequenced. Both of these tracks can be found on Vienna. Despite his machine-like timing, Cann would often do things that neither drum machines nor electronically sequenced percussion could do at the time. Specifically, he would often play very precise triplet fills and crescendos, especially on the snare drum. While these two techniques are easily accomplished by electronic instruments today, around 1979‚Äì1982 they were virtually impossible. In essence, it could fool the listeners to believe they were hearing a drum machine, only to prove them wrong through out-performing the rather rudimentary sequencing possibilities of the time. From a technical perspective, Cann preferred a traditional grip. On the Quartet album and subsequent tour (1982), Cann employed several sets of Simmons SDS-V electronic percussion pads, even to the point where he had an extra kit consisting of the hexagonal Simmons pads, which he played standing up. This way of playing was relatively unique and Cann seemed to be using this setup for one song only, namely \\"The Song (We Go)\\" from Quartet.

He spent nearly all his playing career as a centre half for Luton Town. Born in Birmingham to Florence Laura (n√©e Whiley) and Henry Sydney Owen, Owen began his football career playing for the Birmingham YMCA team before joining Birmingham City as a youth player. After the end of the Second World War, he made it into the club's first team for the 1946‚Äì47 season, but played just five times in the Second Division and was allowed to leave at the end of the season. Owen signed for Luton in June 1947. He played 388 league games for the club and 423 in all league and cup games, and after constant displays of natural ability in the 1949‚Äì50 season, was appointed as captain by manager Dally Duncan. He earned three caps for the England national football team in 1954, and selected as part of the squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, at which he appeared in England's first match, a 4‚Äì4 draw with Belgium. He also played twice for the Football League XI. In 1959, his final season as a player, Owen was named the FWA Footballer of the Year. On 27 April 1959, he was appointed as player-manager of Luton following the departure of Dally Duncan six months earlier; Owen was therefore in charge of the club for the 1959 FA Cup Final against Nottingham Forest. As well as serving as manager for the match, he also captained the side from his position at centre half. After less than a year in the job, a \\"fundamental disagreement on policy\\" led to his resignation on 23 April 1960. He later became first team coach of Leeds United under Jack Taylor and then Don Revie throughout the 1960s and 1970s, bringing with him trainer Les Cocker. In 1978, he was hired by Manchester United manager Dave Sexton to be the club's youth coach. He remained in the position for three years until shortly after Sexton's departure from the club at the end of the 1980‚Äì81 season. Owen is credited with spotting the potential of Mark Hughes as a striker, having selected him for the youth team during his final season working at Old Trafford.

He established his own ministry in 1986, called Reasons to Believe that promotes progressive and day-age forms of old Earth creationism. Ross rejects both evolution and abiogenesis as explanations for the origin and history of life, instead promoting the argument of intelligent design. Early life and education Hugh Ross was born in Montreal, Quebec and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia. Ross earned a B.Sc. in physics from the University of British Columbia and an M.Sc. and Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Toronto; and he was a postdoctoral research fellow for five years at Caltech, studying quasars and galaxies.Dr. Hugh Ross, President & Founder of RTB, aboutCaltech Campus Pubs, January 22, 1999Caltech Campus Pubs, Jan. 15, 1999 Apologetic career Before starting Reasons to Believe, Ross was on the ministerial staff at Sierra Madre Congregational Church. In addition to apologetics writing, Ross speaks regularly in academic venues and churches, as well as regular podcasts \\"I Didn't Know That\\" (formerly Creation Update), and \\"Science News Flash.\\" He spoke at the 2008 Skeptics Society' \\"Origins Conference\\" at California Institute of Technology alongside Nancey Murphy, Victor Stenger, Kenneth R. Miller. Sean Carroll, Michael Shermer and Leonard Susskind. Ross has publicly debated scientists Jerry Coyne, Eugenie Scott, Victor Stenger, Peter Ward, Lewis Wolpert, Michael Shermer, Peter Atkins and Rob Tarzwell. Ross has also debated young Earth creationists, including Ken Ham, Kent Hovind, Duane Gish, Danny Faulkner, Andrew McIntosh, John Morris and Ray Comfort. In 2012 he won the Trotter Prize, delivering the Trotter Lecture at Texas A&M; University on \\"Theistic Implications for Big Bang Cosmology.\\" =Old Earth Creationism (OEC)= Ross believes in progressive creationism, a view which posits that while the earth is billions of years old, life did not appear by natural forces alone but that a supernatural agent formed different lifeforms in incremental (progressive) stages, and day-age creationism which is an effort to reconcile a literal Genesis account of Creation with modern scientific theories on the age of the Universe, the Earth, life, and humans. He rejects the young Earth creationist (YEC) position that the earth is younger than 10,000 years, or that the creation \\"days\\" of Genesis 1 represent literal 24-hour periods. Ross instead asserts that these days (translated from the Hebrew word yom) are historic, distinct, and sequential, but not 24 hours in length nor equal in length. Ross and the RTB team agree with the scientific community that the vast majority of YEC arguments are pseudoscience and that any version of intelligent design is inadequate if it doesn't provide a testable hypothesis which can make verifiable and falsifiable predictions, and if not, it should not be taught in the classroom as science.

According to tradition Pabo \\"the Pillar of Britain\\" was driven out of the North in 460 and settled in Anglesey. He is said to have been buried in the area. From the 14th century at least, when a stone cross was erected in the ruler's memory in the abbey's churchyard, Pabo has been identified as its founder, having retired, as many Welsh kings are said to have done, to a heremitic retreat. Family The Old Welsh genealogies of British Library, Harleian MS 3859, calls him a son of Cenau son of Coel Hen. Later Welsh genealogies insert two generations by making him son of Arthwys son of Mar son of Cenau son of Coel, though this presents greater chronological problems. The genealogies give him a royal line of descendants as the father of Dunod Fawr, Sawyl Penuchel and Ardun Benasgell, and a saintly one as the grandfather of Deiniol, Asaph and Tysilio. As to his period, Elis Gruffydd's Chronicle says that his daughter married Maelgwn GwyneddBromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein, p. 496 while an Irish genealogy says that his son \\"Samuel Chendisel\\" (the Irish equivalent of Pen-isel) married Deichter, daughter of Muiredach Muinderg, the king of Ulster. Their son Sanctan founded Kilnasantan in County Dublin after travelling to Ireland with his brother Mat√≥c Ailithir. The Irish Liber Hymnorum confirms that Sanctan and Mat√≥c came to Ireland from Britain.Peter C. Bartrum (1993), A Welsh Classical Dictionary, National Library of Wales, pp. 580-581. Pabo must have been roughly the same age as Muiredach, whose death-date (after a reign of 24 years according to other sources) is given in the Annals of Tigernach as 489.Annals of Tigernach, AT 489.3 Llanbabo A tradition identifies Pabo as the founder of St Pabo's Church, Llanbabo (at Llanbabo, Anglesey). The first author to record it is antiquarian Henry Rowlands (d. 1723), who writes that \\"Pabo, frequently called Post Prydain, i.e. the Support of Britain, for his great valour against the Picts and Scots, retired here [in Anglesey], and built his church at Llan Babo.\\"Rowlands, Mona antiqua restaurata, p. 157-8. A stone cross was erected in the ruler's memory in the abbey's churchyard at the same time Bangor Cathedral was being built. Welsh poet Lewis Morris reports that the memorial cross was discovered there around 1650. The monument, dated to the 14th Century, bears the carved image of a king and an accompanying inscription. The inscription is in part illegible but the following reading has been suggested; :Hic iacet Pa[bo] Post Priid Co[nf Gr] ‚Ä¶ [t]el [i]ma[ginem obtulit] :\\"Here lies Pabo the Upholder of Britain, Confessor, Gruffudd ab Ithel offered (this) image\\" Some scholars argue, in the absence of early evidence, that the tradition is probably spurious though the identity of the historical Pabo who did give his name to the church remains otherwise unknown.

For example, mobile devices use a certain amount of idle period to ensure that they remain connected to access points and therefore consume more power when performing the following tasks in a wireless network. * Network assisted Roaming - Enables the WLAN to send messages to associated clients, for better APs to associate with clients.

He was born in Ashington, Northumberland. He made 486 appearances for Burnley ranking him sixth in their all-time appearance list. Playing career Adamson, a right-half, joined Burnley in January 1947 after playing non-league football in his native Ashington and working as a miner. His early career was interrupted by national service, which he completed with the Royal Air Force, meaning his debut had to wait until February 1951, when Burnley played away to Bolton Wanderers. He played once for the England B team, but never made the full England side. He was an ever-present as Burnley won the First Division in 1959‚Äì60 and captained the side to the 1962 FA Cup Final which they lost against Tottenham Hotspur. He was also named Footballer of the Year in 1962. Adamson formed a midfield partnership with inside-forward Jimmy McIlroy, around which much of Burnley's creative play was centred. Coaching career He retired in 1964, having played 426 league games, and joined the Burnley coaching staff. He had previously coached the England team in the 1962 World Cup in Chile and was the Football Association's preferred choice of manager ahead of Alf Ramsey but declined the offer. In February 1970, when Burnley manager Harry Potts was made general manager, Adamson stepped up to become team manager. Burnley were relegated at the end his first full season in charge, but returned to the top- flight in 1973, winning the Second Division title. Burnley were relegated again in 1976, although Adamson had already left that January. In May 1976 he was appointed as manager of Dutch side Sparta Rotterdam, but left the following month. In November 1976 he was made manager of Sunderland, but was unable to prevent them from relegation from the First Division. He left Sunderland in November 1978, taking over from Jock Stein as manager of Leeds United. His time at Leeds is well remembered for the huge roars of \\"Adamson Out\\" with which the crowd greeted his later appearances. He left Leeds in October 1980. He took no further part in professional football and spent the rest of his life in Burnley. Adamson died on 8 November 2011, aged 82. He was predeceased by his wife, May, and daughters, Julie and Jayne. He is survived by three granddaughters and two grandsons. On 1 August 2013 his biography was set to be released, written by Dave Thomas and published by Pitch Publishing.

As tai-pans of Jardine Matheson & Company, the Keswick family have at some time been closely associated with the ownership or management of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd., the Canton Insurance Office Ltd, (now the HSBC Insurance Co), The Hongkong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Company Limited, Star Ferry, Hong Kong Tramway, the Hong Kong Land Investment and Agency Co Ltd, and the Hongkong and Whampoa Dock Co Ltd. First generation =The Hon. William Keswick (1834‚Äì1912)= The founder of the dynasty, William Keswick was born in 1834, in Dumfriesshire in the Scottish Lowlands. His grandmother, Jean Jardine Johnstone was an older sister of Dr. William Jardine, the founder of Jardine Matheson & Company His father Thomas Keswick had married Margaret Johnstone, Jardine's niece and daughter of Jean, and entered the Jardine business. The company operated as opium traders and had a major influence in the First and Second Opium Wars although the company stopped this trading in 1870 to pursue a broad range of other trading interests including shipping, railways, textiles and property development. William arrived in China and Hong Kong in 1855, the first of five generations of the Keswick family to be associated with Jardines. He established a Jardine Matheson office in Yokohama, Japan in 1859. He returned to Hong Kong to become a partner of the firm in 1862. He became managing partner (Taipan) from 1874 to 1886. He left Hong Kong in 1886 to work with Matheson & Co. in London as a senior director responsible only to Sir Robert Jardine (1825‚Äì1905), a son of David Jardine, William Jardine's older brother and the head of Mathesons in London. He spent three spells on the Legislative and Executive Councils of Hong Kong between 1868 and 1887. William represented Epsom, Surrey, as Member of Parliament from 1899 and was appointed the county's High Sheriff in 1898. He died at his home, Eastwood Park, Great Bookham, Surrey, on 9March 1912. William had lived in the house since 1882 and on his death, it passed to his son Henry. =The Hon. James Johnstone Keswick (1845‚Äì1914)= J.J. Keswick, younger brother of William, arrived in the Far East in 1870 and remained for 26 years, mostly based in Hong Kong. Nicknamed, \\"James the bloody polite\\", a tribute to his personality. Like his brother, he was a Member of the Legislative Council and Chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce in five spells between 1890 and 1900. He was Sir Harry Smith Parkes' son-in- law and taipan of Jardine, Matheson from the 1890s to the turn of the century. He founded Hongkong Land together with close associate Sir Paul Chater, a development company established in 1889 which remained closely associated with Jardine Matheson. =John Johnstone Jardine Keswick (1842‚Äì1904)= John Johnstone JardineDirectory of Scotland 1899, pg 507England & Wales National Probate Calendar Index of Wills and Administrations, 1858-1966 Keswick was based in Calcutta, where he headed Jardine Skinner & Co, with a fellow Scot as his business partner John (Skinner) Stewart. J.J.J. Keswick was also the chairman of the Rio Tinto Company (now Rio Tinto Group) in the early years of the 20th century. He lived at Dormont, Lockerbie, Dumfries.The Railway News, vol. 51, 1889, pg 164 Second generation =Henry Keswick (1870‚Äì1928)= Son of William, Henry Keswick arrived in Hong Kong in 1895 the year before his uncle James left. He had previously spent two years in the New York office of Jardines. The first gap in the long line of continuous association with Hong Kong occurred when he returned home to represent Hong Kong at the coronation of King George V in 1911. He did return to Hong Kong and the Far East in his yacht \\"Cutty Sark\\" in 1922. He remained a Director of Jardines until his death in 1928. Like his father, Henry served as M.P. for Epsom, Surrey, and on his death left UK estate valued at ¬£466,409, worth approximately ¬£46 million . He married Ida Wynifred Johnston and had 3 children, David Johnston, Sir William Johnston \\"Tony\\" Keswick and Sir John Henry Keswick KCMG. Third generation The next family members to be associated with Hong Kong and Shanghai were Henry's sons \\"Tony\\" and John Keswick. As well as being directors of Jardines they served as members of the Legislative and Executive Councils in Hong Kong and of the Shanghai Municipal Council responsible for Shanghai's International Settlement. They were also Chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Chamber of Commerce at various times. When William and his father Henry Keswick returned to the United Kingdom they both served as members of parliament with responsibility for Far Eastern interests. =Sir William Johnstone \\"Tony\\" Keswick (1903‚Äì1990)= \\"Tony\\" Keswick was born in Yokohama, Japan but returned to England as a boy to attend Winchester School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He arrived in the Far East in 1926. Keswick and his brother remained directors of the firm after they had left the Far East. He was in charge of the Shanghai office (at that time the Head Office in the Far East) from 1935 until 1941. He was also Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council during the crises leading to the Pacific War, and survived a murder attempt by the Japanese in Shanghai. During the Pacific War, he served as head of the China Theatre of the Special Operations Executive, Britain's wartime secret service. =Sir John \\"The Younger\\" Keswick (1906‚Äì1982)= John Keswick followed his brother to the far east in 1929 and replaced him in Shanghai after the shooting incident. Like his brother, John Keswick worked for the Special Operations Executive (SOE) alongside Nationalist leader Chiang Kai- shek's spy chief General Dai Li in Chongqing. He fled Shanghai when the Japanese took the city, escaping with his wife Clare to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and served during the war with Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten's staff. John Keswick returned to Shanghai after the war to organise in the rebuilding of Jardine's office and to reestablish the firm's trading links throughout China and Asia. In 1949, after the communist party's takeover of China, Jardine's head office was moved to Hong Kong. Despite attempting to work with the communists, business conditions became worse. Operations were closed in 1954 with the effective nationalisation of the company's interests and a $20m loss. John Keswick became a member of the Hong Kong Executive Council in 1952. He retired as Tai-pan in 1953 and joined Matheson & Co in 1956. He returned temporarily as non-executive Chairman of Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong from 1970 to 1972. While in England, he and his brother financed the buy-out and then public flotation of Jardine Matheson. He was married in 1940 to the Roman Catholic, Clare Elwes (1905‚Äì1998), youngest child of the tenor Gervase Elwes. Their only child was Margaret, known as Maggie Keswick, gardener and author (1941‚Äì1995), who founded Maggie's Centres for those suffering from cancer.Maggie's Centres She had two children with her husband, the landscape architect Charles Jencks, whom she had married in 1978, as his 2nd wife. (Charles Jencks remarried in 2006 Louisa Lane-Fox, former wife of historian Robin Lane Fox and mother of Martha Lane Fox, Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho). Fourth generation =Sir Henry Keswick= Tony Keswick's son, Young Henry, born 1938 as Henry Neville Lindley Keswick, joined Jardines in 1961 and was assigned to the firm's offices in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. He was made a Director in 1967, Senior managing director in 1970 and chairman in 1972. He retired as Senior managing director and chairman in 1975. He returned to London and is the current chairman of Jardine Matheson Holdings. =Sir Chippendale Keswick= Sir Chips Keswick, Tony Keswick's second son who was born in 1940, was not associated with Jardine Matheson but instead with the London merchant bank, Hambros. He was the chairman of English football club Arsenal F.C. =Simon Keswick= Young Henry's youngest brother, Simon Keswick, born 1942, joined the firm in 1962 and a Director in 1972 but left Jardines in 1977 to join his brother at Matheson & Co. He returned to join Jardines again in 1983 as Senior managing director and then chairman after his father managed to remove the former managing director David Newbigging. Keswick started the restructuring of the company becoming more international rather than tied to Hong Kong. He retired as Tai-pan in 1988 after seeing the firm's holding office redomiciled to Bermuda and restructuring the firm's senior management organisation. Fifth generation The family still owns considerable holdings in the company with a 5th generation working within the company.Jardine Matheson Limited: Directors =Percy Weatherall= Percy Weatherall (born 1957) or Edward Percy Keswick Weatherall, is a great grandson of Henry Keswick (1870‚Äì1928).

Family tree This is the family tree of William Jardine (1784‚Äì1843), co-founder of the Far Eastern conglomerate, Jardine Matheson Holdings.  Controversy  Members of the Keswick family, notably Ben Keswick, have been openly criticised by animal welfare organisations following the release of an investigation into egg suppliers to Jardine Matheson owned retail group Dairy Farm. The investigation was covered by major news outlets in Hong Kong. Websites were subsequently published accusing Ben Keswick, Adam Keswick and Percy Weatherall of failing to address the animal welfare and food safety problems depicted in the investigation.

On August 11, 1970 the Squires traded his rights to the New York Nets in exchange for a draft choice and cash.RememberTheABA.com Virginia Squires detailed year by year notes page He played professional ball both in the National Basketball Association and in the now defunct American Basketball Association. His nickname was \\"The Whopper\\", and he stands 6 feet 11 inches tall. As a rookie, Paultz made his first playoff appearance in 1971 with the New York Nets. He spent his first five seasons, all in the playoffs, with the ABA Nets, and was a key player in their 1973‚Äì74 ABA championship season. He was then traded to the San Antonio Spurs where he made four appearances in the playoffs, including one in an ABA championship final from 1975 to 1979. Although Paultz moved with a bulky stiffness, he was a very heady player.

The primary star is suspected to be an orange dwarf star, while the secondary star is a red dwarf star. Given that this system has the same visual magnitude as HD 209458, it promises much for the study of close transiting extrasolar planets. The star can be found with binoculars 0.3 degrees east of the Dumbbell Nebula (M27). As of 2005, it has been confirmed that an extrasolar planet orbits the primary star within the system. Stellar system HD 189733 A is an orange dwarf star of the spectral type K1.5V. The star has a mass of 81 percent that of the Sun, a radius 76 percent, and a luminosity of 33 percent. The star is between 89 and 102 percent as enriched in iron as the Sun, making the star more than 600 million years old. The star has starspots which affect its luminosity by 1.5 percent in visible light. As a result, it is listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars as a BY Draconis variable with the variable star designation V452 Vul. Discovered in 2006 by the infrared 2MASS astronomical survey, 2MASS J20004297+2242342 or HD 189733 B is a dim red dwarf star of spectral type M. The companion was observed at a separation of 216 astronomical units away from the primary star. Orbiting in a clockwise orbit (which is nearly perpendicular to the orbital plane of transiting planet HD 189733 b), the orbital period is estimated around 3,200 years long. Planetary system HD 189733 A has one known planet, designated HD 189733 b, a gaseous giant 13% larger than Jupiter close enough to complete an orbit every two days. Using spectrometry it was found in 2007 that this planet contains significant amounts of water vapour. This planet is the second extrasolar planet where definitive evidence for water has been found. The chemical signature of water vapour was detected in the atmosphere of this planet. Although HD 189733b with atmospheric temperatures rising above is far from being habitable, this finding increases the likelihood that water, an essential component of life, would be found on a more Earth-like planet in the future. Astronomers have created a rough map of HD 189733b's cloud-top features using data from the Spitzer infrared space telescope. > Although Spitzer could not resolve the planet into a disk, by measuring > changes as the planet rotated, the team created a simple longitudinal map. > That is, they measured the planet's brightness in a series of pole-to-pole > strips across the planet's visible cloud-tops, then assembled those strips > into an overall picture. Probably due to strong winds, the hottest point on the planet seems to be \\"offset by about 30 degrees longitudinally\\" from the substellar point (\\"high noon\\"). In late 2008, the spectral signature of carbon dioxide was found in HD 189733b's atmosphere. In 2013, albedo measurements at visible wavelengths in the range of 290‚Äì570 nm using the Hubble Space Telescope STIS (Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph) instrument, reported in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, determine the planet to have a deep blue hue due to optically thick reflective clouds containing silicates (glass) \\"rain\\". The paper detailing the results reports measurement of \\"geometric albedos of Ag = 0.40 ¬± 0.12 at 290‚Äì450 nm [near ultraviolet to blue in the visible light region of the electromagnetic spectrum] and Ag < 0.12 at 450‚Äì570 nm ... with sodium absorption suppressing the scattered light signal beyond ‚àº450 nm as predicted by models of hot Jupiter atmospheres.\\" Atmospheric transmission spectrum taken in 2020 has showed the presence of opaque haze, and spectral signatures of sodium and potassium. Star-Planet Interaction Controversy In 2008, a team of astronomers first described how as the exoplanet orbiting HD 189733 A reaches a certain place in its orbit, it causes increased stellar flaring. In 2010, a different team found that every time they observe the exoplanet at a certain position in its orbit, they also detected X-ray flares. Theoretical research since 2000 suggested that an exoplanet very near to the star that it orbits may cause increased flaring due to the interaction of their magnetic fields, or because of tidal forces. In 2019, astronomers analyzed data from Arecibo Observatory, MOST, and the Automated Photoelectric Telescope, in addition to historical observations of the star at radio, optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths to examine these claims. They found that the previous claims were exaggerated and the host star failed to display many of the brightness and spectral characteristics associated with stellar flaring and solar active regions, including sunspots. Their statistical analysis also found that many stellar flares are seen regardless of the position of the exoplanet, therefore debunking the earlier claims. The magnetic fields of the host star and exoplanet do not interact, and this system is no longer believed to have a \\"star-planet interaction.\\" Some researchers had also suggested that HD 189733 accretes, or pulls, material from its orbiting exoplanet at a rate similar to those found around young protostars in T Tauri Star systems. Later analysis demonstrated that very little, if any, gas was accreted from the \\"hot Jupiter\\" companion.

History The family originates from Anreppen, a village on Lippe river in Westfalia, Germany (now a part of Delbr√ºck town). In 15th century Anreps, belonging to the Teutonic Knights, settled in Livonia. In 1626, during the Thirty Years' War, this country became a dominion of Sweden. Anrep family was soon naturalized in Sweden and introduced to the Riddarhuset, or House of Knights, in 1635. According to Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, German von Anrep was a Field Marshal in Sweden in the 16th century, and some Anreps were later also on French and Prussian military service . By 1710, in the Great Northern War between Peter I of Russia and Charles XII of Sweden, Frederick Wilhelm I von Anrep, a captain in the Swedish army, had been taken to Moscow as a prisoner. From that time his branch of the family remained in Russia, serving the Tsars, generally in military or naval posts. Russian Anreps retained the Lutheran religion of their ancestors. * Barbara Johandotter von Anrep (born 1534 - died ?) wife of Johann von Uexk√ºll (1532 - 1563). * Adolf Heinrich von Anrep (1717 - 1765) was the Landsmarshal of Livland, i.e. the chairman of the assembly of Livonian nobility. * Heinrich Reinhold von Anrep (ru: Roman Karlovich von Anrep) (1760 ‚Äì January 25, 1807) was a Russian general of cavalry during the Napoleonic Wars. Killed in the Battle of Mohrungen. * Roman von Anrep (ru: Roman Romanovich von Anrep) (died 1830), a son of the previous, was a colonel and later a major-general. He commanded a Uhlan regiment in Caucasus during Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829 and was a confidant of High Commander, Ivan Paskevich. Describing this campaign in his memoirs The voyage to Arzrum, Aleksandr Pushkin mentions R.R. Anrep. Later, in a letter to his wife, Pushkin referred to the death of R.R. Anrep, who had drowned in a swamp . The reason of the poet's attention to the officer is probably the fact that both of them courted the same young girl, Annette Woolf, in 1826 . * Joseph Carl von Anrep (ru: Iosif Romanovich von Anrep) (1796 ‚Äì 1860), a brother of the previous, was a colonel in Russian army, promoted to general shortly before his death. In 1853, by edict of Tzar, he was styled Count von Anrep-Elmpt in order to preserve the title of his wife's father, Count von Elmpt. * Reinhold von Anrep-Elmpt (ru: Roman Iosifovich von Anrep-Elmpt) (1834 ‚Äì 1888), a son of the previous, was a Russian explorer, who traveled intensively from 1870 in all five continents and published many volumes of his travel notes. * Vassily Konstantinovich von Anrep (1852 ‚Äì 1927) was a professor of forensic medicine and a Russian statesman. He had two sons, named after the first Russian saints, princes Boris and Gleb. * Boris Anrep (Boris Vassilievich von Anrep, 1883 ‚Äì 1969) was a Russian artist, active mostly in Britain, who devoted himself to the art of mosaics and achieved work of monumental character in many private and public places. * Gleb Anrep (Gleb Vassilievich von Anrep; September 10, 1889 ‚Äì January 9, 1955) was a physiologist, the follower of Ivan Pavlov, a member of the Royal Society from 1928, professor in University of Cambridge and in Cairo University.

Plot summary The events of the novel take place in the mid-1980s during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and soon after the troop withdrawal, back in the then Soviet Union. It is a stirring account of the trials of Lieutenant Oleg Sharagin, a platoon commander in the elite Soviet airborne forces, his fellow officers and soldiers. It also portrays the ordinary Afghans who suffered enormously under the Soviet occupation. Sharagin survives many combat operations but is critically wounded just a few months before the end of his tour of duty when his platoon is ambushed in the course of a major offensive against the Mujahideen. He is evacuated to a hospital in Kabul, undergoes surgery, and finally finds himself reunited with his family. But back home he realizes his military career is over. The war haunts Sharagin and the pain caused by the wound turns his life into a nightmare, leading to a dramatic finale. The novel is a good example of Russian \\"accurate fiction.\\" It puts a human face on the Soviet soldier without sparing the gory details, like the hard to comprehend top-down authority and license for physical punishment and humiliation within the Russian army, the mental suffering which young soldiers and officers endured during their catastrophic experience in Afghanistan, or the gruesome killings of innocent Afghan civilians. The novel first came out in Russian in 1997 in an abridged version. In 2006, it was published by Eksmo, one of the largest publishing houses in Russia. The Russian and English versions can also be found on \\"Art of War\\" , a project dedicated to the soldiers of the recent wars, which was created in 1998 by a Russian veteran of the Afghan war, Vladimir Grigoriev.

It is an entity such as an arbitrator or tribunal board, generally of a public administrative agency, which has powers and procedures resembling those of a court of law or judge, and which is obliged to objectively determine facts and draw conclusions from them so as to provide the basis of an official action. Such actions are able to remedy a situation or impose legal penalties, and they may affect the legal rights, duties or pri of specific parties.West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2. Copyright 2008 The Gale Group, Inc. Powers Such bodies usually have powers of adjudication in such matters as: * breach of discipline * conduct rules * trust in the matters of money or otherwise Their powers are usually limited to a very specific area of expertise and authority, such as land use and zoning, financial markets, employment law, public standards, and/or a specific set of regulations of an agency. Differences from judicial bodies There are some key differences between judicial and quasi-judicial bodies, in that: * Judicial decisions are bound by precedent in common law, whereas quasi-judicial decisions usually are not so bound; * In the absence of precedent in common law, judicial decisions may create new law, whereas quasi-judicial decisions must be based on conclusions of existing law; * Quasi-judicial bodies need not follow strict judicial rules of evidence and procedure; * Quasi-judicial bodies must hold formal hearings only if mandated to do so under their governing laws or regulations; * Quasi-judicial bodies, unlike courts, may be a party in a matter and issue a decision thereon at the same time. Decisions In general, decisions of a quasi-judicial body require findings of facts to reach conclusions of law that justify the decision. They usually depend on a pre- determined set of guidelines or criteria to assess the nature and gravity of the permission or relief sought, or of the offense committed. Decisions of a quasi-judicial body are often legally enforceable under the laws of a jurisdiction; they can be challenged in a court of law, which is the final decisive authority.

Biography =Early life= Born on 12 October 1924 at Sonamukhi in Bankura district, Kanika joined Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan in West Bengal, India. She was trained in both classical and Rabindrasangeet in Sangeet Bhavana (School of Music) at Santiniketan. Shantiniketan (which literally means Abode of Peace) was built on the model of an Ashram (educational hermitage). For this reason, Kanika is also occasionally referred to as Ashram Kanya or 'girl of the Ashram'. She was fortunate to take music lessons from none other than Rabindranath Tagore. It was Tagore who named her Kanika (her original name being Anima), also the name of one of his books on Poetry. Her other gurus were Dinendra Nath Tagore, Sailajaranjan Majumdar, Indira Devi Chaudhurani and Santidev Ghosh. She participated in dance-dramas directed by Rabindranath and toured all over India as a member of his cultural troupe. =Career= Kanika Bandyopadhyay joined Sangit Bhavana as a teacher and in due course became Head of the Department of Rabindrasangeet and later its Principal. She was made Professor Emeritus of Visva-Bharati. Since 1943, Kanika had been a regular artiste of the Calcutta station of All India Radio and gave performances at the national level in the musical programmes arranged by other stations as honoured artiste. Her gramophone records came out even in the lifetime of the Poet (Tagore) and there are over 300 gramophone discs to her credit. She was also a singer of Bhajans, Nazrulgeeti (songs by Kazi Nazrul Islam) and Atulprasad's songs. However the first song recorded by her was neither a Tagore song nor a Nazrul Geeti but a Bengali Adhunik song composed by Niharbindu Sen. Kanika was invited to sing by programme organizers not only in India but also in Europe and America and was acclaimed everywhere for her unique rendering of the subtle nuances of emotions expressed in Rabindranath's lyrical compositions. She has written three books on this genre. Her life has been well documented on film by noted film directors. She was associated with the Elmhirst Institute of Community Studies during the last years of her life. She received the highest accolade from Visva-Bharati University, the Desikottama. =Death= Kanika died at the age of 76, on Wednesday 5 April 2000, at SSKM Hospital in Calcutta after a prolonged illness involving lung and cardiac problems. She left behind her a school of music, with numerous students, who bore the legacy of her very own stylization of Rabindrasangeet. Of her students, Rezwana Chowdhury Banya, the singer from Bangladesh, is perhaps the most well-known, for her striking similarity to Kanika's singing style. Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave a condolence speech saying that Kanika \\"was among the best exponents of Rabindra Sangeet. Generations of music lovers were charmed by her golden voice.\\" Excerpt from obituary In his obituary: \\"Nightingale of Rabindrasangeet is no more\\" published on 5 April 2000, Sankar Ray beautifully summarises his experience of Kanika Bandyopadhyay as a singer: My memory takes me back to a rainy evening in 1960. All India Radio was broadcasting a programme directly from Santiniketan Ashramik Sangha. Amidst heavy rain, a melodious voice reverberated around. It was Kanika Bandyopadhyay rendering Saghana Gahana Ratri Jharichhey Shrabanadhara (heavy downpour amidst the darkness of night). I still remember the melodious voice of Mohardi as she used to be known....For those for us whose youth had been conditioned by the aesthetic and cultural traditions set out by singers like Kanika Bandyopadhyay, Debabrata Biswas, Subinoy Ray, and Rajeshwari Dutta, it is difficult to write on Mohardi. Next time when I shall go to Shantiniketan, no more shall I have the opportunity to be amidst the melodious breeze that carried her voice as often she used to sing from her house there. Farewell, Mohardi, you remain as ever-lit star in the horizon of our aesthetic sense. Musical style Kanika Bandyopadhyay was a contemporary of other notable exponents of Rabindrasangeet, namely Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, Chinmoy Chattopadhyay, Suchitra Mitra, Debabrata Biswas, Sagar Sen, Sumitra Sen, Santidev Ghosh and Subinoy Roy. In particular, her musical style has often been compared and contrasted with that of Suchitra Mitra. While both singers excelled in songs of love and worship (puja and prem), Kanika's oeuvre was melodious yet melancholy, plaintive yet soul-stirring, whereas Suchitra was bold and strong in her renditions. Personal life Kanika was married in 1945 to Birendra Chandra Bandypadhyay, former deputy librarian of Viswa Bharati University and a renowned poet. The couple had no children; but later she adopted her younger sister's only son Priyom (Tanaji, the name given by Mohor di). In her later life, Kanika receded to a reclusive lifestyle and led the simple life of an ashramite in Santiniketan.

Founded in 1908, it is present in Italy and abroad with different commercial offices and 10 production sites. Avio operates in 5 main business areas in the civil and military sectors: * modules and components for aircraft and helicopter propulsion systems *solid- propellant motors for space and tactical propulsion *MRO and services *aeroderivative gas turbines for marine and industrial applications *electronic/electrical control and automation systems Avio is Prime Contractor for the new European launcher Vega and sub-contractor for the Ariane program, both financed by the European Space Agency (ESA) The company is active in the field of technological research. It carries out projects in collaboration with 14 Italian and 10 foreign universities and research centres, which are aimed at the continuous improvement of product and process technologies. It also undertakes the research of solutions in order to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft engines, in conformity with the objectives of consumption and emissions reduction dictated, within the European area, by the ACARE body.[Avio Group 2009 Consolidated Financial Statements] Avio has 5 sites in Italy, France and French Guiana, and employs around 1000 people, about 30% of whom work in research and development. Avio is listed on the Milan stock exchange in the Star segment: in 2018 it had revenues of 388.7 million euros.  History  = Early 20th century = In 1908, aeronautical production was in its early stages in Turin, Italy. At that time Fiat decided to design and produce an airplane engine, the SA 8/75, derived from racing cars. The first mass-produced engine produced by Fiat was the A10. 1,070 units were created between 1914 and 1915: at this point the pioneer age had come to an end and the company decided to design and construct complete aircraft. Thus in 1916 the Societ√† Italiana Aviazione was founded, changing its name in 1918 to Fiat Aviazione. In Turin, besides aircraft engines, and along the lines of the internal-combustion engine, Fiat diversified production with the construction in 1909 of Fiat San Giorgio for marine diesel engines, the area from which activities in the field of industrial engines for electric power generation later ensued. In Colleferro (Rome), the Bombrini Parodi-Delfino-BPD Company, established in Genoa in 1912, started manufacturing explosives and chemical products, from which the space segment originated. The aeronautical field began in Brindisi with the SACA Company. Gradually, other companies began such as the CMASA di Marina Company in Pisa, founded in 1921 by German design engineer Claude Dornier, in collaboration with Rinaldo Piaggio and Attilio Odero. = Development of large engines and turbines = Avio were present in the development and manufacture of engines for the production of electric energy, having developed large engines for ships. Fiat started the study of marine engines in 1903. Beginning from 1926, with engineer Giovanni Chiesa, the manufacture with engines with 750mm-diameter cylinders, the maximum diameter permitted by technologies of the time, which increased engine power up to 4,500HP. In 1971, production began on large diesel engines in Trieste, in a new factory established through a collaboration agreement with the state company IRI (Institute for Industrial Reconstruction). Starting from the 1930s, a strategy of diversification, which derived from engines produced for ships and submarines, led Avio entering the field of railway diesel engines, while the first engines for the production of electric energy for industrial use had been experimented with in the early post-war period. The development of a gas turbine was started up through a collaboration agreement stipulated with Westinghouse in 1954. Avio's experience in this field, combined with the increased availability of methane gas, enabled the development and manufacture of several electric power generation plants in Italy and abroad. The success of the gas turbines led to the decision to leave the segment of large diesel engines in order to focus on this. In 1973, Fiat set up the company Turbomeccanica Turbogas (TTG), focusing entirely on the Turin Company's activities in the energy sector. In 1986, Fiat Aviazione incorporated TTG, and developed the activities until 2001, when it was made over to Siemens, changing the marine and industrial activities to the development of aeroderivative turbines.[La Storia futura - Stefano Musso Professor of History of Political Movements and Parties at the Faculty of Political Science, Turin University - 2008- AVIO S.p.A.] = Development of explosives and propellants= The BPD industrial plants were established 50 km from Rome, along the railway line for Cassino, due to the initiative of the engineer Leopoldo Parodi ‚Äì Delfino, supported by Senator Giovanni Bombrini, and the resolution of the State to provide the country with an independent production capacity in the chemical field. Situated in a poor region of Roman countryside, the town of Colleferro began around the industrial site and was elevated to a municipal district in 1935 by Royal Decree. The town grew in correlation with the production activities of BPD that, from explosives, extended to several chemical products derived for agricultural and industrial uses. The production plants developed and expanded attracting labour, and the company provided for social works. In 1927, the BPD Test Centre started to experiment on the first rockets powered by chemical powder. After the Second World War, on the initiative of Francesco Serra di Cassano, son-in-law and successor to BPD's founder, mechanical production, which had been started up in the 1930s for munitions activities, was developed and expanded. The Test Centre intensified experimentation on propellants, beginning with the launching of multi-stage sounding rockets for research in the upper atmosphere, produced at the Salto di Quirra military firing range in Sardinia, in the early 1960s. In 1966, following its success with the rockets, BPD entered into a contract with ELDO (forerunner of the European Space Agency ‚Äì ESA) for the development and production of the apogee boost motor of the ELDO- PAS telecommunications satellite. This led to development in the field of solid-propellant motors. In 1968, the SNIA Viscosa Company took over BPD, which became SNIA-BPD. In 1975, under this company configuration, ESA initially gave the BPD branch of SNIA the task of developing and producing the separation motors of the European Ariane satellite launcher, and in 1984, the contract for the manufacture of the Ariane 5 boosters. The Ariane take-off motors have been completed now for over twenty years at the launch site in French Guiana, under the subsidiary companies Europropulsion and Regulus, set up in 1988. In 1990, SNIA sold the BPD branch to the Gilardini Company, which was bought by Fiat Aviazione in 1994. From 1989 Fiat Aviazione became FiatAvio S.p.A. = Aviation activities = Fiat took on the role of Italian prime contractor for the NATO F-104G aircraft. With the name change of the Fiat Aviazione to Fiat Avio in 1989, the company collaborated on the design and manufacture of propulsion systems for, among the others, the Tornado and Harrier in the military sector, and Boeing and Airbus in the commercial one. In 1997, the acquisition of the controlling stake in Alfa Romeo Avio from Finmeccanica was key to a national strategic project aimed at reducing the excessive fragmentation of the Italian companies and at increasing competitiveness through more systematic synergies. = 2000‚Äìpresent = Avio was able to increase internationalisation, working in the fields of design, development and manufacture of components and modules for aerospace propulsion. After the setting up of AvioPolska in 2001, the creation of DutchAero followed in 2005, with the acquisition of Phillips Aerospace. . In 2003, the Fiat Group, struggling with the crisis in the automobile sector, sold Fiat Avio S.p.A. to a consortium formed by American private equity fund, the Carlyle Group (70%), and Finmeccanica S.p.A. (30%), who won against competition from French company Snecma. At the time, Fiat Avio was valued at ‚Ç¨1.5 billion, and changed its corporate name to Avio S.p.A.http://www.fiatgroup.com/it- it/mediacentre/press/Documents/2003/Cessione%20FiatAvio%20ad%20Avio.pdf In August 2006, English private equity fund Cinven announced that it had acquired Avio S.p.A. from Carlyle for an enterprise value of ‚Ç¨2.57 billion. Avio is owned by Space2 (72%) and Leonardo S.p.A. (28%)  Production and activities The sectors of activities are today: *contract and system integration of Vega: a light launcher of satellites whose qualification launch took place successfully in February 2012; *technological development of Vega engine systems as Vega C and Vega E whose revolutionary liquid oxygen/methane engine will be capable of releasing multiple satellites into different orbits during a single mission. Vega C is an evolutionary development of the current Vega launcher, the smallest among European launchers: with Vega C, the load capacity will increase from Vega‚Äôs current 1,500 kg to 2,200 kg (+60%) in Low Earth Orbit.Vega E will be the ideal product for small satellites, starting in 2024; *improvement of the innovative filament winding technology common to the Vega family and Ariane 6 launchers to build solid propellant motors from pre- impregnated epoxy sheets of carbon fiber through filament winding and automatic fabric deposition; *management as prime contractor of the entire Vega system launcher in development of the P120C Solid Rocket Motor together with ArianeGroup. The P120C was derived from the P80 Vega launcher first stage and will be manufactured with carbon fiber prepreg, material and filament winding technology. It was designed to be used as a lift-off booster for the new Ariane 6 in order to guarantee absolute synergy between the European launchers. The sectors of activities in the past were also: *design, development and production of modules and components for aircraft and helicopter propulsion systems. Avio is the Italian champion for military aeroengines and leader worldwide as regards mechanical transmissions; *aeroengine MRO and management services for aircraft and helicopter propulsion systems; *design, development and construction of aeroderivative gas turbines for marine and industrial applications, as well as for the production of electric energy; * production of control and automation systems, and electronic/electrical systems destined for the aerospace, marine, energy and defence sectors.

The band had a large fanbase in Greece and Cyprus. They disbanded in 2005. History Hi-5 had been created in 2003 and consisted of Marlen Angelidou, Irini Psichrami, Frosso Papacharalambous, Shaya and Nancy Stergiopoulou, who were the winners of the Greek version of the popular talent show Popstars. The band released more than five chart-topping singles over the course of one year. In 2003, their debut single \\"Ksero ti Zitaw\\" reached number one in Greece, on the strength of high sales. The single went Gold and enjoyed heavy radio and television airplay. Hi5 were able to sustain their commercial success by releasing the song \\"To Tixero Asteri\\" which also reached the top of the airplay charts, furthering the band's mainstream exposure. The success of those singles was accompanied by the release of Hi-5's debut self- titled studio album, which also reached number one in Greece, eventually reaching Platinum status for shipments of over 40,000 copies. The longevity of the album in the charts was supported by the commercial success of its third single, \\"Allo Agapi Ke Allo Sex\\". That single was able to replicate the success of the two previous singles, enjoying massive airplay thanks to the controversial and suggestive nature of its lyrics and the catchiness of its melody. By the end of the year, Hi5 received various awards from MAD channel and other shows because of their phenomenal success. In the Christmas season of 2003, the band also released a Christmas album, which was certified Gold partially thanks to the success of its single \\"Agnosto Paidi Tou Kosmou\\". In 2004, the band released their third studio album, which enjoyed great initial success. The lead single \\"Genithika Ksana\\" peaked at number one in the Greek singles chart, while also receiving heavy airplay. The album followed suit, debuting at number one, while going Gold. However, the success of this album was short-lived. Specifically, the band faced a backlash after a live performance during which they were booed. During the same live performance a part of the audience threw yogurt at Hi-5. This event was widely reported by the Greek media. The deteriorating popularity of the band following this event led to numerous fights between the band members, which led to their decisive breakup by the end of 2004. Furthermore, their song Lathos I Sosto was chosen to be played in the Billboard radio during the summer of 2003. Their third and last studio album, entitled Makria Apo Afti ti Gi, was released in June 2004. Hi-5 disbanded in February 2005, after a fight and the closing down of their record company, the Greek repertoire division of Warner Music Greece. All of the band's members, except Papacharalambous, who had returned to her homeland of Cyprus in order to finish her studies, pursued solo careers. Angelidou got the main role of the musical Saturday Night Fever, Psichrami worked in bars performing rock songs, Shaya worked in a nightclub and Stergiopoulou also worked in a nightclub alongside Greek singer Thanos Petrelis. There are unconfirmed rumors that Angelidou, Psichrami and Stergiopoulou are working on their debut solo studio albums. Following the band's disband, Shaya had been featured in songs by multiple recording artists and has released her debut single as a solo singer in 2010.

Regency  Because Prince Pedro, who was heir to the throne, had just proclaimed the independence of Brazil, Prince Miguel was in Vienna, Queen Carlota Joaquina was exiled in Queluz and Isabel's older sisters (Maria Teresa and Maria Francisca of Assisi) had married to Spanish infantes (princes), Isabel Maria was chosen to be Regent of the Kingdom until the recently crowned Emperor of Brazil (Pedro I of Brazil and future Pedro IV of Portugal) returned. Pedro IV, however, immediately abdicated in favour of his daughter Maria da Gl√≥ria (who became Maria II of Portugal), who was in London, with the condition that she should marry her uncle Miguel. Isabella Maria continued as regent until 1828, when a civil war started between absolutists, supporting Miguel, and liberals, supporting Maria II (called the Liberal War) that would end with a liberal victory and defeat and consequent exile of Miguel.  Later life  Isabel Maria retired from politics and turned her life to religion.

Railroad cars  The Midwest Central's passenger cars were constructed at the Midwest Central shops using Southern Pacific flat cars, East Broadtop Railroad coal hopper cars, or were custom built on a Midwest Central fabricated chassis. There are 3 cabooses: one is all-metal from the White Pass and Yukon Railroad, the second is the last surviving (and only!) Bellevue and Cascade narrow gauge caboose numbered 055 and the third is wood construction on a SP flatcar frame by scaling up an HO model Florence and Cripple Creek caboose to full size. The Midwest Central has two D&RGW; boxcars (3366 and 3007), one D&RGW; gondola, and numerous D&RGW; and WPYRR flat cars. The flat cars range from fully restored (D&RGW; Nos 6216 and 6206) to extremely rough. Many years ago several East Broad Top coal hoppers were purchased and transported to Mt. Pleasant with the thoughts of using the brake gear, draft gear, steel frame and trucks as the starting point for creating additional passenger cars.

Besides a standard analog transmission, WLS broadcasts over two HD Radio channels,https://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=4 HD Radio Guide for Chicago and is available online. History =Early years= The American Broadcasting Company, owners of Chicago's ABC Radio Network affiliate WENR (890 AM)‚Äîwhich operated in a time-share arrangement with WLS (890 AM), radio adjunct of the Prairie Farmer and itself an ABC affiliate‚Äîlaunched this station as WENR-FM on January 1, 1948. This time-share agreement ended on February 1954, when ABC's parent company American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres and the Prairie Farmer merged their AM stations into one, WLS becoming the surviving entity and jointly owned by both. WENR-FM retained its callsign but began simulcasting WLS's programming, later adopting its own separate programming formats (which included classical and Broadway theatre show tunes) for part of the day. ABC purchased the Prairie Farmer in November 1959, giving it sole ownership of WLS and WENR-FM. In 1964, WENR-FM became WLS-FM, with a beautiful music format broadcasting in stereo from Noon to Midnight, as well as Blackhawks home games. By 1968, WLS-FM expanded its hours on the air to 6 a.m. to Midnight, simulcasting WLS (AM)'s Clark Weber morning show from 6 to 8 a.m. and carrying Don McNeill's Breakfast Club from 8 to 9 AM. In the summer of 1968, WLS-FM experimented with a locally produced underground progressive rock show. Dubbed \\"Spoke\\", and using the tag-line \\"The Flash That Holds The Wheel Of Life Together\\", the program aired from 10 PM to midnight and featured unnamed announcers using stage-whisper delivery laden with plate reverb, obtuse biker-style free verse intros delivered over backgrounds of electronic music, mid-eastern music and sound effects. It was replaced in 1969 with a syndicated program from the ABC Radio Network entitled \\"Love\\", voice-tracked by \\"Brother John\\" Rydgren, and which aired from 7 PM to 1 AM. Shortly afterwards, WLS-FM adopted a full-time progressive rock format. =Rock to disco to top 40= In 1970, ABC decided to change the call signs on all of their FM radio stations in order to distinguish them from their co- owned AM (and excluding two markets, TV) counterparts; this not only included WLS-FM, but WABC-FM/95.5--New York City, WXYZ-FM/101.1--Detroit, KXYZ-FM/96.5 --Houston, KGO-FM/103.7--San Francisco, and KQV-FM/102.5--Pittsburgh.\\"ABC puts a new emphasis on FM.\\" Broadcasting, August 10, 1970, pg. 45.

WDAI became the original Chicago radio home of Steve Dahl in January 1978, and used the slogan \\"Chicago's Best Rock\\" with the Morning Sickness with Steve Dahl. WDAI switched to all-disco as \\"Disco DAI\\" at the stroke of Midnight on New Year's Day, 1979, marking the switch by going from Don McLean's \\"American Pie\\" to \\"Staying Alive\\" by the Bee Gees. Steve Dahl would wind up the morning host at former crosstown rival WLUP, and would anchor the \\"Disco Demolition Night\\" promotion in July 1979 that would later be cited as a harbinger for the genre's popular collapse in America during 1980. The station stayed with the disco craze until 7 a.m. on May 22, 1980, when, after stunting by playing Donna Summer's \\"Last Dance\\" on a loop, 94.7 became WRCK-FM, \\"95 W-ROCK\\", an Adult Top 40/Oldies hybrid, and featured Bob Sirott in mornings for a brief time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64xrYXFTLwE The 1978 switch to disco was the first in a series of format changes that continued up to its switch to classic hits in October 2012. On October 20, 1980, WRCK-FM switched to a Top 40 format with a partial-simulcast of WLS (AM), and changed its call sign back to WLS-FM.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1980/RR-1980-10-24.pdf The simulcast included Larry Lujack during the morning drive and Brant Miller's evening show into the mid-1980s, while airing its own programming during the day. WLS-FM was thereafter programmed separately during the day and simulcast WLS AM at night. On January 20, 1986, WLS-FM ended simulcasting the AM and became known as WYTZ, \\"Z-95\\".HighBeam Initially, the station aired a rock-leaning Top 40 format, but by the late 1980s, the station was more mainstream, as competitor \\"B96\\" increasingly focused on R&B; and dance music. WYTZ, which was briefly rebranded as \\"Hell\\" (an aborted and controversial one-week stunt) and \\"Hot 94.7\\" in March 1991, could not withstand the competition from \\"B96\\". =Rotating formats= WYTZ again became WLS-FM at 7 p.m. on October 25, 1991. After playing \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\" by Harry Nilsson, the station switched formats to talk, again simulcasting WLS AM much of the time. On June 13, 1994, WLS-FM split off from simulcasting and launched its own \\"Young Talk\\" format featuring Robert Murphy (\\"Murphy in the Morning\\"), Rich Roeper, Rush Limbaugh (in simulcast with the AM), Jay Marvin, Lise Dominique, Turi Ryder and Johnny Vonn, as a way to compete against WLUP-FM's hot talk format. This failed to turn around ratings, and WLS-FM went back to a full-time simulcast once again with WLS (AM) on June 2, 1995. After still achieving low ratings, WLS-FM separated from WLS AM again on November 22, 1995. After stunting with Christmas music throughout November and December, the station switched to a country music format and became \\"94.7 Kicks Country\\", WKXK, at Noon on December 26. The first song aired on \\"Kicks Country\\" was \\"Gone Country\\" by Alan Jackson. However, Infinity (now Entercom) station WUSN continued to do well as the heritage country station, while WKXK was unable to even achieve mediocre ratings. On May 1, 1997, WKXK dropped the country format and flipped to classic rock, branded as \\"CD 94.7\\" (with new WXCD call sign being implemented on May 23). After some early ratings success, former heritage classic rocker and competitor WLUP-FM, which had earlier switched to a modern adult contemporary format, returned to the classic rock format, resulting in mediocre ratings at WXCD. WXCD abruptly dropped classic rock on November 29, 2000, and flipped to an ‚Äò80s‚Äô hits format, rebranded as \\"The Zone\\", and changed its call sign to WZZN. By July 2001, the station evolved into a gold-based modern AC format.HighBeamHighBeamHighBeam On September 14, 2001, WZZN changed formats again to alternative rock to compete with WKQX, which previously had the format to itself.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2001/RR-2001-09-21.pdfHighBeam By 2003, \\"The Zone\\" again evolved into more of an active rock format, all the while using \\"94.7 The Zone\\" as its handle, and positioning itself on the air as \\"the hardest rock on the planet\\". However, the station continued to flounder in the ratings. By 2004, the station began beating WKQX with the shift to active rock, but yet beaten again by WKQX during the Spring/Summer 2005, when WDRV moved from classic hits to classic rock and WLUP-FM from classic rock to mainstream rock.HighBeam =Oldies years= After long-time oldies station WJMK dropped its 1960s'/'70s' oldies format in June 2005 for a variety hits format branded as \\"Jack FM\\", at Noon on September 26, 2005, WZZN dropped its active rock format (and finally ditched the \\"Zone\\" branding) and flipped to oldies as \\"94.7 True Oldies\\", with programming from Scott Shannon's The True Oldies Channel except for morning and afternoon drive times, when the station aired local programming. The final song on \\"The Zone\\" was \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" by Metallica, while the first song on \\"True Oldies\\" was \\"Rock 'n' Roll Music\\" by The Beatles. Everything oldies is new again at 94.7 FM, Chicago Tribune - September 27, 2005 This change made WZZN the only oldies station on the FM dial in Chicago. The air talent \\"The Zone\\" let go in this transition included WRCX alums Freak and Sludge, and WLUP-FM alums James Van Osdol, Mark Zander, and Jimmy Novak. In 2006, the station added some local air personalities who were previously at WJMK when it was an oldies station. Eventually, the station was live and local (which included hosts such as John Landecker, Dick Biondi, and Greg Brown) except for overnights, when they would continue to run True Oldies Channel programming. In 2007, Walt Disney Company sold its ABC Radio radio division, including WLS (AM) and WZZN, to Citadel Broadcasting. From 2007 to 2008, the oldies format was modified to include a small amount of 1980s' hits and a focus on oldies from 1964 to 1979. The station continued to play a couple pre-1964 oldies per hour. alt=On June 19, 2008, Citadel announced that WZZN would become once again WLS-FM. The WZZN call sign was dropped at Midnight on June 25, 2008, and as of 12:01 AM on June 26, 2008, the station has officially been known as WLS-FM. The idea was to bring back the heritage of WLS and its old Top 40 format and jingles. The station was then branded as \\"94.7 WLS-FM\\" with the slogan \\"Chicago's Greatest Hits Of All Time.\\" Citadel to Bring Back WLS-FM in ChicagoFirst Legal ID of WLS-FM's Return Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. =Shift to classic hits= On October 1, 2012, WLS-FM modified their oldies format to a classic rock-leaning classic hits format. The Scott Shannon \\"True Oldies Channel\\" branding, programming, and voice tracking were removed. The pre-1964 oldies were dropped entirely, while Motown and 1970s pop and disco hits were cut back, and more 1980s songs were also added. The focus on the station was now hits of the 1970s and early 1980s with only several 1960s songs per hour. Morning DJ Dave Fogel was released to make room for Brant Miller's return to the station (Fogel was hired at WJMK just two days after being let go from WLS). Fred Winston was also hired as a full-time DJ in afternoons. In 2013, Robert Murphy was hired as an afternoon jock; Winston was let go. On November 3, 2014, Jack Diamond, formerly of sister station WRQX in Washington, D.C., became WLS-FM's new morning show host, with Miller shifting to a co-hosting role. Diamond would leave the station in July 2015, with Miller re-assuming a main hosting role. Kim Berk, formerly of WWFS in New York, joined Miller as co-host in January 2016. Robert Murphy was released from the station in December 2016 to be replaced by Ron Parker (from WCBS-FM in New York) to handle afternoon duties. As of late 2017, the focus is now mainly hits of the 1970s through the early 1980s, with a small sampling of pre-1970/post-1989 and mid-late 1980s and early 1990s hits mixed in due to the playlist being limited. The start of 2018 brought Dave Fogel back to WLS-FM as Berk's morning co-host, with Miller moving to a weather reporting only position. On November 17, 2017, WLS-FM became Chicago's only classic hits station when rival WJMK changed formats to classic hip-hop.

For example, in a business office, a memorandum (abbrev. memo) can be used to provide a solution to a problem, make a suggestion, or convey information. Other forms of professional writing commonly generated in the workplace include email, letters, reports, and instructions. In seeking to inform, persuade, instruct, stimulate debate, or encourage action from recipients, skilled professional writers make adjustments to different degrees of shared context, e.g., from a relatively accessible style useful for unsolicited contact letter to prospective clients to a technical report that relies on a highly specialized in-house vocabulary. A professional writer may be freelance, meaning he or she works on a self-employed basis, or fully employed in an occupation where their primary responsibility is the production of specialized documentation, such as journalism, marketing, advertising, public relations, or the military. Yet even workers who don't necessarily think of themselves as professional writing practitioners regularly produce professional documentation regularly in the course of their work as lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs, engineers, and social workers.Garay, Mary Sue, Bernhardt, Stephen. Expand Literacies: English teaching and the new workplace. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990. Print. Moreover, as Anne Beaufort observes, writing skills have become increasingly important to so-called \\"blue collar\\" occupations since \\"technologies have driven more record keeping and decision making to those who are directly involved in manufacturing, information-processing, and care- giving activities.\\"Beaufort, Anne (2006) \\"Writing in the Professions.\\" Handbook of Research on Writing: History, Society, School, Individual, Text. Charles Bazerman, ed. Lawrence Erlbaum; Mahwah, NJ (217-222)[217] 978-0805848700. Overview Professional writing is any type of writing with the purpose of facilitating the work of a business or organization and directed to internal or external audiences of the professional writer's organization. Examples of internal business writing include email messages, memos, and reports while some examples of external business writing are letters and email messages. Professional writing differs from other types of writing, such as academic and technical writing, because the term defines a general overview of writing that is done for profit in a workplace environment. Professional writing differs from academic writing due to the difference in purpose and readership between the two styles. Academic writing informs the audience through a critical approach and directs further thinking by reconstructing the order of the author's thinking and the intertextual traces of their reading, while professional writing is applied to a business or setting (a hospital, a company, or a factory) and is meant to facilitate work through communication. The audience of academic writing is also limited in contrast to professional writing; specialized experts in specific fields make of the primary readership of academic writing while the amount and identities of readers of professional writing can be varied. When writing, professional writers must take into consideration the possibility of unexpected tertiary readers who can come across their document.Johnson- Sheehan, Richard. \\"Planning and Organizing Proposals and Technical Reports.\\" https://owl.english.purdue.edu/media/pdf/20080628094326_727.pdf Professional writing differs from technical writing because of the type of content in technical writing. Technical writing could be identified as a concentration of the broad generalization of professional writing‚Äîtechnical writing is principally directed towards fields of interest. Both are similar in that they take place in professional workplace context and are primarily targeted to allow communication between experts; however, technical writing focuses on technical, specialized topics, such as science, technology, and engineering. Style The audience of professional and business documents plays a significant role in the style of a professional document. Successful professional writers adapt their document to fulfill the needs of their audience. Four factors are taken into consideration when a professional writer creates a professional document: # the reader's pre-existing knowledge of the covered material, # the readers' expectations of style and format based on examples of the same genre, # the readers' level of reading based on the reason for reading the document, and # the relationship between writer and reader.Tebeaux, Elizabeth, Dragga, Sam. The Essentials of Technical Communication (3rd ed.). New York: Oxford University Press, 2010. Print The reader's pre-existing knowledge remains an important focus for a professional document because it would affect the reader's ability to read the document. For example, a general audience with little knowledge of a document's subject would be unable to read it if it contained specific, technical jargon. A professional writer would then have to minimize the amount technical jargon or define terms for the reader. Expectations of style and format are influential in the format and development of a professional document. Precedents created by earlier documents of the same genre of a professional writer's work heavily influence how the reader of his or her document will judge the credibility of both the writer and document. Documents belonging to a specific genre are expected to be written in a way that adheres to a format and style that defines that genre. If a professional writer were to produce a document that does not adhere to the precedence style, he or she and the document would lose credibility. Regarding business and professional writing, the relationship between writer and reader is key. The familiarity between the two influences the language used. For example, an employee might write more informally via email to a coworker of the same hierarchical level than he or she would write via email to his or her employer. Uses =Communication= There is, particularly in business, a need for concise and unambiguous communication with colleagues, suppliers, clients, and the general public. Professional writing forestalls inattentiveness and criticism. =Persuasion= Persuasive professional writing is connected to the concept of rhetoric, which focuses on informing or persuading and relies upon stimulating the interest of the audience through creating authoritative arguments. A professional writer uses rhetoric and persuasion when creating a document that is intended to suggest a solution to a problem or encourage action. A professional writer uses persuasive language when trying to influence the reader to do something as a result of reading a document. Professional writing Feasibility reports and economic justification reports are examples of documents that have such purposes. =Information= Clear and concise professional writing is vital in many fields where misunderstanding could have serious consequences, such as in law, engineering, technical manuals, and product labels. Misunderstandings might also occur with international audiences; for this reason, a professional writer would have to take careful consideration of cultural differences. The use of language, style, and even color in a document could have detrimental effects because these elements, along with others, can change meaning when translated. For example, a picture of a woman wearing a swimsuit on the beach in an ad would be met with nonchalance in the United States; however, if the same picture was shown in an area with a prevalent Muslim populace, it would be met with outrage because of the religious beliefs that bar women from showing skin. This analysis and consideration of direct and possible audiences help create clear and concise writing and language that professional language requires. =Examples= *Law ‚Äì case studies, briefs, client correspondence *Marketing ‚Äì advertising, market analysis, proposals *Science and Engineering ‚Äì journals, technical data, manuals *Retail ‚Äì inventory reports, damage reports, data sheets, manuals, labels *Entertainment ‚Äì proposals, contracts, reviews, books *Publishing ‚Äì web content, proposals, contracts, book editing *Military ‚Äì operational reporting, orders production, policy or decision briefs, doctrine *writing a professional career overview Skills The Association of Teachers of Technical Writing regard the development of technical communications that are \\"clear, effective, efficient, appropriate, accurate, useful, and delivered on schedule and within budget as nearly as possible\\" as a core principle-in-practice. Skills may be acquired through practice or formal learning. While many practitioners of professional writing do so as a vocation rather than as full-time employment, the element of \\"professionalism\\" is what defines professional writing. Such is the importance of professional writing in the modern world, many academic institutions offer courses up to degree level on the subject, with some tailored to specific professions such as social work.

He served on the faculty at Harvard, Emory (where he received a Bachelor of Science and MD degree), and Duke universities. His research in the 1940s paved the way for cardiac catheterization in medicine today. National PA day is celebrated in many places on October 6th to commemorate the day the first class of PAs graduated from Duke University in 1967 (it also happens to be Dr. Stead's birthday). Postgraduate work In 1967, he graduated the first class of Physician Assistant students from Duke University's PA program. He interned at the Internal Medicine and Surgery at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts and also at Cincinnati General Hospital and Boston City Hospital.In Boston, Eugene Stead and Paul Beeson (b. 1908) both trained under Soma Weiss. His educational philosophy placed emphasis on knowing how to look up information for \\"just in time\\" delivery rather than memorizing volumes of information only to forget it before needed. The niche that he envisioned for PAs was that most health care encounters do not require extensive training and that superior medical care can be delivered by relieving the burden of mundane medical encounters by training PA professionals to know when to seek additional input. He wanted all PAs to be required to have mentoring relationships with Physicians to ensure access to a larger body of medical knowledge. Beliefs Dr. Stead had high hopes for distance education in medical education. He believed and talked regularly about the \\"politics of medical education\\" and believed that distance education could replace the first two years of medical school. After studying at home and passing national boards, he believed that medicine could be taught in the clinics and offices of private practices. While he worked and helped build the medical education institutions, he had some disdain for the way they practiced and acted as gatekeepers to the medical profession.

The CERNET project is funded by the Chinese government and directly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Education. It is constructed and operated by Tsinghua University and the other leading Chinese universities. Structure CERNET has a four-layer hierarchy (the nationwide backbone, regional networks, provincial networks and campus networks). CERNET National Center is located in Tsinghua University, which is responsible for operation and management of CERNET backbone nationwide. The ten regional network centers and main nodes are distributed in Tsinghua University, Peking University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, South China Institute of Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Southeast University and Northeast University, which are responsible for operation, management, planning and construction of CERNET regional backbones. CERNET provincial nodes are distributed among 38 universities in 36 cities around the country. Data and statistics Sketch of the CERNET backbone By the end of 2000, bandwidth of CERNET backbone has been up to 2.5 Gbit/s. CERNET has 12 global and regional channels connected with the United States, Canada, the UK, Germany, Japan and Hong Kong, the international gateway bandwidth over 250 Mbit/s. The transmission rate of the regional networks has reached 155 Mbit/s. More than 2,000 education and research institutions, 1.2 million PCs and 20 million end users have connected to CERNET. Developments An early CERNET satellite ground station, displayed as a memorial on the Huazhong University of Science and Technology campus in Wuhan CERNET has been powered to allow access by most higher education institutions nationwide with backbone upgrades and expansions having been accomplished in eight regions. The large-scale China Education Information System has been built up. Mirroring systems for discipline-specific information of famous overseas universities, and a full-text search system for higher education and key subject information will soon be set up. CERNET is an important platform for China's remote learning initiative. To accommodate demands of distance learning program as defined in Education Revitalizing Initiative Oriented to 21st century, CERNET high-speed backbone was started in 1999. By leveraging the existing fiber infrastructure and resources from state and local treasury, CERNET has completed 40% of the 20,000 km high-speed transmission link crossing 29 provincial capitals, and cut over the 2.5G high-speed trunks from Beijing via Wuhan to Guangzhou, and from Wuhan via Nanjing to Shanghai. Nowadays, the medium-to-high-speed regional network (155M) connecting 21 cities is just under construction. Some 40 to 50 universities and colleges have accessed to CERNET backbone at speed of 10M to 100M. As a pioneer in Internet study in China, operation of CERNET and advancing CERNET management. CERNET, a computer network independently designed, constructed and managed by technical personnel at home, is technologically powerful. In network construction, CERNET attaches highest importance to network security. In 1999, CERNET set up China's first network contingency response center called CCERT. Up to date, CCERT has handled more than 2000 network security cases, efficiently ensuring normal operation of CERNET and advancing CERNET management. Experimentation and research CERNET is also the experiment platform for China to proceed with study on next generation of Internet applications, and has played a major role in the China Next Generation Internet effort. Relying on current network facilities and technical competence, CERNET has set up the IPv6, an experiment platform with nationwide coverage. In 1998, CERNET joined 6bone, an experimental IP-based network of next generation, and became a backbone member of it in November. CERNET is the first in China that interconnects with Internet2, the next generation of Internet, providing its users with an easy access to Internet2. CERNET is an important cultivation base for information and network professionals in China. For example, in the study program for computer information network and its application in the \\"State Key Sci-tech Breakthrough Project during Ninth Five- Year Plan Period\\", researchers from CERNET and other partner organizations published more than one hundred academic papers both at home and abroad, representing a significant achievement in IT competence fostering. Furthermore, CERNET supports and guarantees implementation of a batch of important Internet application projects in China. For example, the on-line enrollment and admission system played a crucial role in the 2000 admission season around the country. Moreover, CERNET enhances the information infrastructure in China, shortens the gap between China and the west in information industry, and plays a pioneer role in China's information initiative.

Stringham was named for Silas H. Stringham, who served in the United States Navy from the War of 1812 through the American Civil War. Stringham was launched on 10 June 1899 by Harlan & Hollingsworth, Wilmington, DE; sponsored by Miss Edwina Stringham Creighton; and was placed in reduced commission on 7 November 1905, Lt. Albert H. McCarthy commanding. Assigned to the Reserve Torpedo Flotilla at Annapolis, MD, upon completion, Stringham was placed in full commission on 30 October 1906 and assigned to the 3d Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet. Stringham operated on the eastern seaboard between Key West, FL and Cape Cod, MA, into 1907. Detached on 11 October 1907 from the Atlantic Fleet, Stringham was placed in reserve, in reduced commission, on 31 January 1908 at the Norfolk Navy Yard. Placed in full commission again on 1 July 1908, Stringham rejoined the 3d Torpedo Flotilla. She operated primarily out of Newport, RI, through October; then proceeded to Charleston, SC, where she was placed in reserve on 19 November 1908. Recommissioned on 14 August 1909, Stringham was assigned duty as flagship of the 3d Division, Atlantic Torpedo Flotilla, on 9 September. During October, she participated with units of the Atlantic Fleet in the Hudson‚ÄìFulton Celebration, steaming up the Hudson as far as Albany, NY, on 8 October. Returning south to Charleston, Stringham was again placed in reserve on 30 November. Assigned to temporary duty with the 1st Torpedo Division on 1 April 1910, Stringham was transferred to the Engineering Experimental Station at Annapolis, MD, on 14 September. She served as a practice ship and training vessel for midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy from 1911 to 1913. On 26 July 1912, near Annapolis, Maryland, Stringham successfully received the first radio signal transmitted from an aircraft to a surface ship. Ensign Charles H. Maddox, USN, transmitted \\"We are off the water, going ahead full speed on a course for the Naval Academy\\" from an altitude of 300 feet to the Stringham, distant three nautical miles. Later test messages from Maddox's \\"Wright flyer style\\" aircraft were received by Stringham at distances of up to 15 miles. Maddox later wrote, \\"These were the first radio messages ever received from an airplane radio transmitting set in the United States and probably in the world.\\" Stringham was placed out of commission on 21 November 1913 at the Norfolk Navy Yard, was struck from the Navy list on 26 November 1913, and designated for use as a target on 17 December 1913. Never actually used as a target, Stringham remained at Norfolk until sold on 18 May 1923 to E. L. Hurst of Roanoke Dock for scrapping.

The company specialises in the production of large bespoke steel castings and forgings, as well as standard rolls, ingots and bars. History The history of the business can be traced back to the 1750s as a small blacksmiths forge and in 1805 George Naylor set up the first commercial steel works at the Millsands Works. In 1829 George Naylor joined forces with his son in law Edward Vickers and established Naylor Vickers & Co.. The Vickers name had a long and illustrious history in engineering until the resulting company, Vickers Ltd., was acquired by Rolls Royce in 1999. Sheffield Forgemasters was first established under this name in 1983 from the merger of Firth Brown and British Steel Corporation's River Don Works forging operations, as a public company. The company can trace its heritage back to the start of the steel industry in Sheffield in the early 19th century. The firms of Vickers, Cammell Laird, and Armstrong Whitworth were all nationalised to form British Steel in the 1960s. Sheffield Forgemasters was later acquired by Atchison Casting Corp.. Atchison went into administration in 2003 which left Sheffield Forgemasters in a predicament. Graham Honeyman managed to ring fence certain areas of the business and successfully carried out a management buy out to save the company. Since then Sheffield Forgemasters has remained the largest independent forgemasters in the world. In 2016 Forgemasters obtained a ¬£30 million loan from US bank Wells Fargo, underwritten by UK's nuclear submarine programme contractors BAE Systems, Babcock International and Rolls-Royce, in view of Forgemasters' vital role in the nuclear submarine programme. The underwriting arrangements are due to expire in July 2019. Capabilities The company specialises in forged and cast steel components for the defence, engineering, nuclear, offshore, petrochemical, and steel processing industries worldwide. The company has the American Society of Mechanical Engineers N-stamp accreditation for critical nuclear components, having produced major components for the Astute class submarines and the civil nuclear industry, including Sizewell B, the UK's only pressurised water reactor. Sheffield Forgemasters currently has the capacity for pouring the largest single casting (570 tonnes) in Europe. The two forging presses in use can exert a pressure of 4,500 tonnes and 10,000 tonnes on a billet of steel. The 4,500 tonne press was installed in 2010 to replace a 1,500 tonne press which dated back to 1897 and was originally steam powered, and after several upgrades became hydraulically operated. 2007 Sheffield floods The company was severely affected by the 2007 United Kingdom floods, when the nearby River Don flooded the works with several feet of water, but after a cleanup effort Forgemasters was back in action within weeks of the devastation.

From the mid-1950s until his death in 1978, Nebel was a hugely popular all-night radio host, with millions of regular listeners and what Donald Bain described as \\"a fanatically loyal following\\" to his syndicated program, which dealt mainly with anomalous phenomena, UFOs, and other offbeat topics. Biography =Youth and young adulthood= Nebel was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States. He dropped out of school after the eighth grade, but he was an avid reader throughout his life, and he was conversant on many topics. Rumor had it that he was the son of a physician and ran away with a circus as a youngster. According to his own account in The Way Out World (1961), Nebel moved to New York City \\"around 1930\\", at the age of 19. His first job there was usher in the New York Paramount Theater. Nebel pursued a number of careers in his young adulthood (including a long period as a freelance photographer and a stint as a sidewalk salesman) before establishing the successful Long John's Auctions, an auction and consignment store in New Jersey. At his auction barn in New Jersey, he was billed as \\"Long John, the gab and gavel man\\", and people would attend just for an evening's entertainment. The nickname \\"Long John Nebel\\" had several sources: \\"Long John\\" was a nickname for his tall, slender build (he stood 6'4\\" [1.93 m] and never weighed more than about 160 pounds [73 kg]). Nebel did not seek a career in radio until around 1954, when he was 43 years old. In 1972, Nebel married the former pin-up model Candy Jones, who became the co-host of his show. Her controversial claims of having been a victim of CIA mind-control influenced the direction of the program during its last six years on the air. =WOR= In the mid-1950s, radio throughout the United States was floundering and trying to redefine itself after the explosive popularity of television. Over several years, Nebel had become friends with many people at various New York radio stations when he bought commercial time to advertise his auction house. WOR, one of New York's leading stations, faced poor ratings in 1954 when Nebel proposed an interview show. The format, as Donald Bain writes, \\"would be devoted to discussing strange and unexplained topics\\". WOR's management was not especially impressed by Nebel's idea. However, deciding they had little to lose (following WOR's failed foray into broadcasting facsimile editions of the morning paper during the early morning hours), WOR offered him a midnight to 5:30 am time slot, the poorest-rated hours. Building on the modest fame of his auction house (and also hoping to generate more business), he used the same name, Long John, when he went on radio. To the surprise of WOR's management, Nebel's show was a quick success among New York's night-owls and early risers. Unidentified flying objects were discussed almost daily, alongside topics such as voodoo, witchcraft, parapsychology, hypnotism, conspiracy theories, and ghosts. Perhaps fittingly for an overnight show, one of Nebel's sponsors was No-Doz caffeine pills. Within a few months Nebel was getting not only high ratings, but press attention from throughout the United States for his distinctive and in many ways unprecedented program (WOR's powerful signal assured that Nebel's show was broadcast to over half of the United States' population). Bain notes that some listeners were put off by his \\"grating, often vicious manner\\", but many more adored him because of (or in spite of) his abrasive style. Keith writes: \\"Though Nebel could be brusque and even imperious in the phone, he was always a sympathetic listener and compasionate host.\\"(Keith, 86) Seven-second delay WOR was worried about some of Nebel's guests or callers using profanity on the air. Nebel used one of the first tape delay systems in radio, giving engineers a chance to edit any unacceptable language before it was broadcast. In 1956, engineer Russell Tinklepaugh invented the system Nebel used. He built a modified Ampex 300 tape deck with an additional set of heads. The deck was able to record on a loop of 1/4\\" tape, and carry the tape around the perimeter of the deck to be played on the second set of heads. This resulted in a delay of several seconds, enough time to hit the \\"stop\\" button to avoid airing foul language. (ref.ex-WOR engineer, Frank Cernese) WMCA, which went all-talk in 1970, used a similar system. It involved two Ampex 350 reel-to-reel machines side by side, each with the order of its heads‚Äînormally (from left to right) erase-record- play‚Äîreversed, to be mounted play-erase-record. Thus the tape loop, transported counter-clockwise, would record the microphone output, and then have to go all the way around to play it back over the air before being erased. When the engineer, producer, or air talent hit the 'dump' button the feed would immediately be switched to the other Ampex, so there was very little disruption of the air product. Today, of course, such delays are done digitally. (ref. ex-WMCA engineer B. Golden) =WNBC= In 1962, WNBC offered Nebel more than $100,000 per year (if not a record sum paid to a radio personality at the time, then very nearly so) to begin broadcasting from their station, and he accepted the offer. He continued there until 1973, when WNBC, facing sliding ratings, decided to switch to an all rock music format. After a protracted battle with station management, Nebel refused to change the content of his show and resigned from the station in protest. According to Bain, one anonymous station employee insisted that the management at WNBC \\"deliberately fucked up [Nebel's] career\\" by spreading unfounded rumors about the format switch and Nebel's reaction to it.(Bain 1974, 225) =WMCA= Nebel was quickly hired by WMCA, where, from 1973 to 1977, he continued his program, virtually unchanged from WNBC. The show was still popular, although his ratings on the less powerful WMCA were not as high as they had been at WNBC. At WMCA, John was constantly pestered by prank callers who often told him \\"Yes John, I'm coming down there, and I'm going to bash your head!\\" =Mutual Broadcasting System= Beginning in 1977, Nebel's show was broadcast nationwide over the Mutual Broadcasting System, replacing Mutual's national distribution of Herb Jepko's radio talk show. =Books= Nebel wrote two books that dealt with some of the most interesting of his guests. The Way Out World, published in 1961, covered his years at WOR and included UFO contactees, a stage magician, the Shaver Mystery, Edgar Cayce, and much more, which Nebel said he had gleaned from his \\"twenty thousand hours of interviewing and research\\". His second book, The Psychic World Around Us, co- written with Sanford M. Teller and published in 1969, dealt more specifically with tales of the paranormal and the guests whom he had interviewed while at WNBC. =Marriage to Candy Jones= Nebel had had a short-lived marriage early in his life, and had a daughter Jackie from that marriage. In the early 60's he was married to Margaret Dallas, but he was single again in 1972 when he met and married the fashion model Candy Jones. She had been one of the favorite pin up girls of the World War II era. The marriage took place after a whirlwind, month-long courtship, although Nebel and Jones had met briefly when Nebel was a photographer decades earlier. Jones became the co-host of Nebel's show almost immediately, and continued in this role until his death. Due to Jones's mood swings and shifts in personality, and some unusual and otherwise- unexplainable events in her life, Nebel said that he had come to suspect she had been a victim of a CIA mind control plot. Her story, with its conspiracy theory overtones, had a definite influence on the content of Nebel's radio show during its final six years. =Death= Although long plagued with heart disease, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1971. Nebel sought various treatments, but by the mid-1970s, he was in very poor health. He continued broadcasting, however, usually six nights per week, with Candy Jones as his co-host. Nebel died in April,1978 and his Mutual network slot was taken over by Larry King in January of that year. His show on WOR, called \\"Partyline\\", was handed to James Randi, skeptic and frequent guest on Nebel's show over the years. Format of the show Nebel's program gave the impression of being freewheeling and unpredictable, prone to sidetracks and digressions; very different from the precise, mannered approach of most contemporary radio. There were occasional heated arguments‚Äîrather mild when compared to the conflict on more recent programs such as the Jerry Springer Show, but such open conflict in any media was quite startling in the 1950s and 1960s. Nebel, along with his regular guests and panelists, would interview various personalities and claimants (such as psychic Kuda Bux), and take occasional telephone calls from listeners in the New York area. He would also interview novelists and discuss their books in detail. He was surprised on one occasion by novelist Iris Murdoch's response that she was a frequent listener and had modeled one of her characters after one of his guests. Nebel's approach was unique: talk radio per se did not yet exist as it would in later decades, and Nebel was navigating largely uncharted territory. Sometimes, Nebel entered the discussions, other times he described himself as a \\"moderator\\" and allowed his guests to have spirited debates, commenting only occasionally to guide the debate, or to announce station breaks. It was not uncommon for Nebel to disappear for 20 minutes or more around 3:00 am and leave his panel of frequent guests to run the show without him. Nebel usually invited callers during the last two hours of the program (from about 3:00 to 5:00 am); up to 40,000 people might try to telephone during this period. Nebel was perhaps best described as a curious skeptic with respect to the reality of paranormal topics; he frequently characterized himself as a \\"non-believer\\". Regarding the claims of the many alleged UFO contactees he interviewed, Nebel stated: \\"I don't buy any of it.\\" He also noted that he was intrigued by the subject of UFOs, but did not have any firm theories or explanations about UFOs in general.1960s Contactees I Have Known (Long John Nebel) Some critics attacked Nebel for allowing crackpots free rein on the program, but he responded by saying his was not a traditional news or investigative journalism show, and that it was up to listeners to determine the validity of any guest's claims. Nebel often asked pointed questions of his guests when he saw logical fallacies or inconsistencies in their stories. He did not suffer fools gladly, unless the fool was exceptionally entertaining. Still, he was rather sympathetic in at least offering guests a forum to state their claims. When programs dealt with health and exercise, Nebel was fond of saying: \\"I am a lover, not an athlete.\\" He also popularized the expression \\"wack-a-ding-hoi\\" for an idea or guest he believed was a little \\"crazy\\". When asked why his television show was no longer on the air, Nebel would respond that he was not good-looking enough to be on television. His friendly, good-humored approach was one of the great reasons for his popularity. =Regular guests= Jackie Gleason was a frequent guest. On one show, Gleason offered US$100,000 to anyone with physical proof of aliens visiting Earth (Gleason later upped the amount to US$1 million, but it was never claimed). Another memorable show found Gleason undertaking a sharp, occasionally even savage, debate with publisher Gray Barker. Gleason took Gray to task for presenting largely unsubstantiated tales of the Men in Black and contactees as factual. The two most frequent guests on his radio show were science fiction writers Lester del Rey and Frederik Pohl. Each appeared on more than 400 of Nebel's broadcasts. Nebel also had philosopher Mortimer Adler and James Randi on frequently. =Sponsors= Nebel's sponsors included some unusual products. For example, the KelCo Class Calculator was, according to Nebel, developed by a NASA scientist, who was an occasional guest on his program. Basically a slide rule, the \\"calculator\\" was designed to pick horse racing winners. Nebel's commercials were often as entertaining as the program itself. Nebel was a master story teller who could spin yarns around the virtues of his sponsors. Commercials often ran several minutes. His seven-minute commercial for a pornographic movie (\\"It Happened in Hollywood\\") was unforgettable. Apparently, he had not reviewed the copy before reading it cold on the air and he fell victim to uncontrollable fits of laughter throughout his long and fruitless attempt to read it.IDDiotTree Another long running sponsor was Ho-Ho's Chinese Restaurant - \\"Ho means Good, Ho-Ho means Good-Good\\". =UFOs= Flying saucers were in the news regularly throughout the 1950s and 1960s and were a frequent topic on Nebel's show. Guests related to this subject included retired Marine Corps Major Donald Keyhoe, contactees George Adamski and George Van Tassel, artist Paulina Peavy, and skeptics like Arthur C. Clarke and Lester del Rey. Nebel discussed the so-called Shaver Mystery, the Flatwoods monster, the Nazca Lines, and many other uncommon subjects. Nebel gave a forum to Otis T. Carr, an Oklahoman who claimed to have discovered the secret of flying saucer propulsion, by studying the works of Nikola Tesla. With some of his regular panelists, Nebel journeyed to Oklahoma City for the unveiling of Carr's saucer. (Carr was later convicted of fraud and jailed after he took several hundred thousand dollars from investors, and never produced his prototype.) =Strange Occurrences= During a Thursday afternoon matinee at New York's Paramount Theatre, Nebel's friend, William Neff, a well-known conjuror, stepped into a spotlight in front of the curtain and began his performance. As Nebel watched it seemed to him that he could see light through Neff's body, as if he were turning into frosted glass. Slowly, Neff became transparent, then disappeared completely, although his voice could still be heard. After a while, a faint outline like a very fine pencil sketch began to appear. A few minutes later, Neff gradually reappeared looking perfectly normal. The watching theatre audience assumed that the vanishing in front of there very eyes was a part of Neff's act. As soon as the show was over, Nebel rushed backstage to ask Neff how he had done the vanishing trick. Neff seemed surprised at the question; he was not aware that he had \\"faded\\", but he admitted that the same thing had happened three years earlier at a theatre in Chicago. Nebel would later write this story in his book \\"The Way Out World\\" and could offer no explanation for it.\\"World Famous Strange But True\\" (1994) by Colin Wilson, Damon Wilson & Rowan Wilson; Magpie Books Ltd; Page 3 =Pranks= Nebel was not above a few pranks, all in the name of showmanship and ratings: on one occasion, for example, he colluded with a friend to offer testimony supporting a guest's claims of astral projection. Nebel spent weeks on his show developing a tale for his audience that the Empire State Building was rotated on giant ball bearings in the wee hours of the morning. At first Nebel said the motion was almost imperceptible. As the prank developed over time, Nebel began telling callers that if they visited the Empire State Building very late at night, they would find the shops at ground level had switched location to the block around the corner. Nebel also was fond of telling his audience that the finest candle wicks were grown on \\"wick farms\\" located in the Midwest. The fact that Nebel's second wife, Candy Jones claimed to have been the subject of CIA experiments in mind-control was discounted as a prank by those who pointed out his history of promoting hoaxes. Nebel, on the other hand, said that he believed what Jones had revealed to him under hypnosis, and never believed that her story was false in any way. Influence Jackie Gleason wrote in his introduction to Bain's biography of Nebel: \\"Why is [Nebel] so strangely entertaining?... because the best entertainment is entertainment that opens your mind and tells you the world is bigger than you thought it was.\\" Radio historian Michael C. Keith wrote: \\"Few people before or since have brought to all-night radio the kind of ingenuity, originality and variety that Nebel did. He represents one of post-World War II radio's creative high points and another example of the special nature of overnight programming... He would come to be regarded as one of after-hours radio's true pioneers.\\"(Keith, 88) Nebel was a formative influence on talk radio: Donald Bain noted that in the early 1970s: \\"Fledgling (radio) announcers at broadcasting schools around the country were played tapes of Nebel shows as part of their course study.\\" Recordings of Nebel's shows have circulated among fans of esoterica for decades. Nebel's format paved the way for later radio hosts, including Art Bell, George Noory of Coast to Coast AM, Hilly Rose, Jeff Rense, and Clyde Lewis, all of whom have broadcast shows on paranormal topics. Colin Bennett called Nebel the Art Bell of his era.Colin Bennett. Manchurian Candy Date. Retrieved from http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/148_candyjones.shtml.

Despite its name, the river is not an upstream portion of the Ammonoosuc River, but instead a separate tributary of the Connecticut River flowing from to the north of the Ammonoosuc. The Upper Ammonoosuc rises in Pond of Safety in the town of Randolph, runs first generally north through rural portions of Berlin (where it flows through the Godfrey Dam), Milan and a corner of Dummer, then west through Stark and then Northumberland where it drains into the Connecticut near the village of Groveton. The end points of that course are approximately 25 air miles (38 km) apart. From Milan to Groveton it is fairly closely paralleled by New Hampshire Route 110. Fort Wentworth was built in 1755 at the junction of the Upper Ammonoosuc and the Connecticut Rivers (now near the village of Groveton). The fort was used sporadically during both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. The watershed area includes the northern Crescent Range, eastern Pliny Range and the eastern and northern Pilot Range, all in the White Mountains. Major tributaries of the Upper Ammonoosuc include: : Nash Stream, rising in the township of Odell, : Phillips Brook, rising in Erving's Location, : the North Branch of the Upper Ammonoosuc, flowing roughly parallel to and east of the main stem (with a ridge between them, that includes Hodgdon Hill and carries NH Rte. 110) in the town of Milan, to join it at West Milan, and : the West Branch of the Upper Ammonoosuc rising on the eastern slope of Mount Cabot in Kilkenny, draining Unknown Pond and York Pond, and joining the main stem below the Godfrey Dam.

Biography Born to Frederick and Hattie Dretske, Dretske first planned to be an engineer, attending Purdue University. He changed his mind after taking the university's only philosophy course, deciding philosophy was the only thing he wanted to do in his life. After graduating in 1954 with a degree in electrical engineering and serving in the Army, he enrolled in graduate school in philosophy at the University of Minnesota, where he received his PhD in 1960. His dissertation, supervised by May Brodbeck, was on the philosophy of time. Dretske's first academic appointment was to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1960, where he rose to the rank of full Professor. In 1988 he was recruited to Stanford University, where he was the Bella and Eloise Mabury Knapp Professor of Philosophy. He remained at Stanford until his retirement in 1998, after which he was Professor Emeritus in Philosophy at Stanford and Senior Research Scholar in Philosophy at Duke University until his death. Dretske held externalist views about the mind, and thus he tried in various writings to show that by means of mere introspection one actually learns about his or her own mind less than might be expected. His later work centered on conscious experience and self-knowledge, and he was awarded the Jean Nicod Prize in 1994. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2003. Upon his death, he was survived by his second wife Judith Fortson, by his children Kathleen Dretske and Ray Dretske, and by a stepson, Ryan Fortson. Philosophical work =Seeing and Knowing (1969)= Dretske's first book, Seeing and Knowing, deals with the question of what is required to know that something is the case on the basis of what is seen. According to the theory presented in Seeing and Knowing, for a subject S to be able to see that an object b has property P is: (i) for b to be P (ii) for S to see b (iii) for the conditions under which S sees b to be such that b would not look the way it now looks to S unless it were P and (iv) for S, believing that conditions are as described in (iii), to take b to be P.Dretske (1969, pp. 78‚Äì93) For instance, for me to see that the soup is boiling ‚Äì to know, by seeing, that it is boiling ‚Äì is for the soup to be boiling, for me to see the soup, for the conditions under which I see the soup to be such that it would not look the way it does were it not boiling, and for me to believe that the soup is boiling on that basis. =Knowledge and the Flow of Information (1981)= Dretske's next book returned to the topic of knowledge gained via perception but substantially changes the theory. Dretske had become convinced that information theory was required to make sense of knowledge (and also belief). He signaled this change at the beginning of the new book, opening the Preface with the lines \\"In the beginning there was information. The word came later.\\"(Dretske 1981, vii) Information, understood in Dretske's sense, is something that exists as an objective and mind-independent feature of the natural world and can be quantified. Dretske offers the following theory of information: A signal r carries the information that s is F = The conditional probability of s's being F, given r (and k), is 1 (but, given k alone, less than 1).Dretske (1981, p. 65) Thus, for a red light (r) to carry the information that a goal (s) has been scored (is F) is for the probability that a goal has been scored, given that the light is red (and given my background knowledge of the world, k), to be 1 (but less than 1 given just my background knowledge). With this theory of information, Dretske then argued that for a knower, K, to know that s is F = K's belief that s is F is caused (or causally sustained) by the information that s is F.Dretske (1981, p. 86) His theory of knowledge thus replaced conscious appearances with the idea that the visual state of the observer carries information, thereby minimizing appeal to the mysteries of consciousness in explaining knowledge. Dretske's work on belief begins in the last third of Knowledge and the Flow of Information,Dretske (1981, pp. 169‚Äì235) but the theory changed again in the book that followed, Explaining Behavior (1988). There Dretske claims that actions are the causing of movements by mental states, rather than the movements themselves.Dretske (1988, p. 15) Action is thus a partly mental process itself, not a mere product of a mental process. For the meaning ‚Äì the content ‚Äì of a belief to explain an action, on this view, is for the content of the belief to explain why it is that the mental state is part of a process that leads to the movement it does.Dretske (1988, pp. 79‚Äì85) =Explaining Behavior: Reasons in a World of Causes (1988)= According to Explaining Behavior, a belief that s is F is a brain state that has been recruited (through operant conditioning) to be part of movement-causing processes because of the fact that it did, when recruited, carry the information that s is F.Dretske (1988, 51‚Äì77) Being recruited because of carrying information gives a thing (such as a brain state) the function of carrying that information, on Dretske's view, and having the function of carrying information makes that thing a representation. Beliefs are thus mental representations that contribute to movement production because of their contents (saying P is why the brain state is recruited to cause movement), and so form components of the process known as acting for a reason. An important feature of Dretske's account of belief is that, although brain states are recruited to control action because they carry information, there is no guarantee that they will continue to do so. Yet, once they have been recruited for carrying information, they have the function of carrying information, and continue to have that function even if they no longer carry information. This is how misrepresentation enters the world.Dretske (1988, pp. 64‚Äì70) =Naturalizing the Mind (1995)= Dretske's last monograph was on consciousness. Between the representational theory of belief, desire, and action in Explaining Behavior and the representational theory of consciousness found in Naturalizing the Mind, Dretske aimed to give full support to what he calls the \\"Representational Thesis\\". This is the claim that: (1) All mental facts are representational facts, and (2) All representational facts are facts about informational functions.Dretske (1995, p. xiii) In Naturalizing the Mind Dretske argues that when a brain state acquires, through natural selection, the function of carrying information, then it is a mental representation suited (with certain provisos) to being a state of consciousness. Representations that get their functions through being recruited by operant conditioning, on the other hand, are beliefs, just as he held in Explaining Behavior.Dretske (1995, pp. 2‚Äì22) =Other philosophical work= In addition to the subjects tackled in Dretske's book-length projects, he was also known as a leading proponent, along with David Armstrong and Michael Tooley, of the view that laws of nature are relations among universals. In his 1970 article \\"Epistemic Operators\\", Fred Dretske discusses epistemic closure and its relationship to philosophical skepticism. The principle of epistemic closure holds the following to be valid: * S knows p. * S knows p entails q. * S knows q. For example, # John knows that he is eating oatmeal. # John knows that eating oatmeal entails that he is not eating scrambled eggs. # John knows that he is not eating scrambled eggs. Epistemic closure, however, is vulnerable to exploitation by the skeptic. Eating oatmeal entails not eating scrambled eggs. It also entails not eating scrambled eggs while being deceived by an evil demon into believing one is eating oatmeal. Because John does not have evidence to suggest that he is not being deceived by an evil demon, the skeptic argues that John does not know he is eating oatmeal. To combat this attack by the skeptic, Dretske develops relevant alternatives theory (RAT). RAT holds that an agent need only be able to rule out all relevant alternatives in order to possess knowledge.Dretske, Fred. 1970. \\"Epistemic Operators\\", The Journal of Philosophy, 67, pp. 1007‚Äì23. According to RAT, every knowledge claim is made against a spectrum of relevant alternatives entailed by the original knowledge claim. Also entailed by a knowledge claim are irrelevant alternatives. The skeptic's alternatives fall into this irrelevant category. The following applies RAT to Johns oatmeal: # John knows that he is eating oatmeal (as opposed to eating scrambled eggs, eating a bagel, bathing in oatmeal, etc.) # John knows that eating oatmeal entails that he is not eating scrambled eggs. # John knows that he is not eating scrambled eggs. # John knows that eating oatmeal entails that he is not eating scrambled eggs while being deceived by an evil demon into believing he is eating oatmeal. # John does not know that he is not eating scrambled eggs while being deceived by an evil demon. (This alternative is irrelevant; it does not lie within the spectrum of relevant alternatives implied by his initial claim.) Although it provides a defense from the skeptic, RAT requires a denial of the principle of epistemic closure. Epistemic closure does not hold if one does not know all of the known entailments of a knowledge claim. The denial of epistemic closure is rejected by many philosophers who regard the principle as intuitive. Another issue with RAT is how one defines \\"relevant alternatives.\\" \\"A relevant alternative,\\" Dretske writes, \\"is an alternative that might have been realized in the existing circumstances if the actual state of affairs had not materialized.\\"Dretske (1970, p. 1021) Selected publications * 1969, Seeing and Knowing, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. * 1981, Knowledge and the Flow of Information, Cambridge, Massachusetts The MIT Press. * 1988, Explaining Behavior: Reasons in a World of Causes, Cambridge, Massachusetts The MIT Press. * 1995, Naturalizing the Mind, Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. * 2000, Perception, Knowledge and Belief, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

It is one of the most important monasteries and mannerist buildings in the country. The monastery also contains the royal pantheon of the Braganza monarchs of Portugal. History and art The sacristy, famous for its different types of marble. The original Monastery of S√£o Vicente de Fora was founded around 1147 by the first Portuguese King, Afonso Henriques, for the Augustinian Order. Built in Romanesque style outside the city walls, it was one of the most important monastic foundations in mediaeval Portugal. It is dedicated to Saint Vincent of Saragossa, patron saint of Lisbon, whose relics were brought from the Algarve to Lisbon in the 12th century. The present buildings are the result of a reconstruction ordered by King Philip II of Spain, who had become King of Portugal (as Philip I) after a succession crisis in 1580. The church of the monastery was built between 1582 and 1629, while other monastery buildings were finished only in the 18th century. The author of the design of the church is thought to be the Italian Jesuit Filippo Terzi and/or the Spaniard Juan de Herrera. The plans were followed and modified by Leonardo Turriano, Baltazar √Ålvares, Pedro Nunes Tinoco and Jo√£o Nunes Tinoco. The church of the Monastery has a majestic, austere fa√ßade that follows the later Renaissance style known as Mannerism. The fa√ßade, attributed to Baltazar √Ålvares, has several niches with statues of saints and is flanked by two towers (a model that would become widespread in Portugal). The lower part of the fa√ßade has three arches that lead to the galilee (entrance hall). The floorplan of the church reveals a Latin cross building with a one-aisled nave with lateral chapels. The church is covered by barrel vaulting and has a huge dome over the crossing. The general design of the church interior follows that of the prototypic church of The Ges√π, in Rome. The beautiful main altarpiece is a Baroque work of the 18th century by one of the best Portuguese sculptors, Joaquim Machado de Castro. It has the shape of a baldachin and is decorated with a large number of statues. The church also boasts several fine altarpieces in the lateral chapels. The Monastery buildings are reached through a magnificent baroque portal, located beside the church fa√ßade. Inside, the entrance is decorated with blue-white, 18th century tiles that tell the history of the Monastery, including scenes of the Siege of Lisbon in 1147. The ceiling of the room has an illusionistic painting executed in 1710 by the Italian Vincenzo Baccarelli. The sacristy of the Monastery is exuberantly decorated with polychromed marble and painting. The cloisters are also notable for the 18th century tiles that recount fables of La Fontaine, among other themes. Pantheon with the tombs of the House of Braganza. Braganza Pantheon In 1834, after the Dissolution of the monasteries in Portugal, the monastery was transformed into a palace for the archbishops of Lisbon. Some decades later, King Ferdinand II transformed the monks' old refectory into a pantheon for the kings of the House of Braganza. Their tombs were transferred from the main chapel to this room.

He headed the Utagawa school. Life and career Little is known of Kunisada II's early life. A pupil of Utagawa Kunisada I, he signed much of his early work \\"Kunimasa III\\". His earliest known prints date to 1844. Kunisada I adopted him in 1846 after he married the master's daughter Osuzu. He took the name Kunisada II , about the time he inherited the house of Kunisada I. He changed his name once more following his master's death, to Toyokuni III. However, since there were three artists called Toyokuni before him, Kunisada II is now often known as Toyokuni IV. Kunisada II worked in the style of his master, but never achieved the same level of success. His prints include over 40 series, mostly of actors (yakusha-e), as well portraits of beauties, illustrations of scenes from literature, erotica, and other subjects. He illustrated nearly 200 books. One of his most celebrated actor series, ‚ÄúThe Tale of the Eight Dog Heroes‚Äù (Hakkendun inu no s≈çshi no uchi), dating from 1852, is drawn from Kyokutei Bakin‚Äôs epic novel, ‚ÄúThe Satomi Clan and the Eight Dogs‚Äù (Nans≈ç Satomi hakkenden), written from 1814-1842 and published in 106 volumes. Kunisada II's popularity waned in the Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912), and he appears to have stopped making prints after 1874. He died on 20 July 1880 and was buried at Bansh≈çin K≈çunji. His Buddhist posthumous name is Sank≈çin H≈çkokujutei Shinji. Students of his include Kunisada III (1848‚Äì1920). Signatures Kunisada II usually signed prints either ÂõΩË≤ûÁîª (Kunisada ga, drawn by Kunisada) or ÂõΩË≤ûÁ≠Ü (Kunisada hitsu, from the brush of Kunisada). He did not sign prints ‚ÄúKunisada II‚Äù. His signature may be distinguished from that of Kunisada I in that the sada kanji is straight in the signature of Kunisada I, but angular in the signature of Kunisada II (see figure). Further, Kunisada I took the name 'Toyokuni' in 1844, and never included the 'Kunisada' signature within the Toshidama cartouche, as Kunisada II often does in the 1850s and 1860s. Moreover, most prints signed 'Kunisada' and by Kunisada II are datable by censor or date seals to post-1850.

Created by Aeon and Takara and animated by Brain's Base, the studio‚Äôs first television production, the series aired on TV Tokyo from April to December 2002. A series of Daigunder toys were produced that could interact with TV screens. Plot Set in a futuristic time where talking robots are common, there is a tournament where robot teams pit off against each other in. The Battle Robots look like humans and transforming animals. A boy named Akira Akebono plans to win the Titan Belt with his robots Bulion, Eaglearrow, Drimog, Bonerex, Despector, Trihorn, Ryugu and also Daigu who form the mighty Daigunder. The Daigunder unit was a creation of Akira's grandfather, Professor Hajime Akebono. Managed by a girl named Haruka Hoshi (later spelled \\"Haruka\\" in the closed captioning of the dub), Team Akira enters many tournaments for Akira to reach his goal. However, there are many occasions when a Battle Robot named Ginsan is out to destroy Daigunder. Ginsan does this under the orders of the evil and mysterious Professor Maelstrom and he is later joined by Tigamaru & Logamaru. Akira and his friends soon find a new ally in DragonBurst, and new comrades in his assistants, DragonFlame & DragonFreezer. Characters =Team Akira= Akira and his robots' base of operations is Dailand and they get around in their plane called the Daishuttle. Team Akira's Battle Robots consist of the Daigunder Unit (Ryugu, Daigu, DragonFlame and DragonFreezer), the Animal Unit (Bulion, Eaglearrow and Drimog), and the Dino Unit (Bonerex, Despector and Trihorn). When damaged, Sabuto gives them upgrades whenever they need it. ; : :: The main character and the Commander of Team Akira, Akira is the grandson of famed Battle Robot creator Hajime Akebono. His dreams of winning the Titan Belt lead him to compete or the Battle Robot Tournament. He challenges other teams with his group of robots. His most powerful and trusted ones is Ryugu and Daigu. The first robot of Team Akira was Bulion (also Hajime's first creation), who Akira played with even as a child. ; : ::Haruka Hoshi (Initially spelled Haruka in the closed captioning, then changed to \\"Heruka\\" [sic] to match the English pronunciation) is a young girl who looking to become a manager of Team Akira & a Battle Robots team. After Team Akira defeats Team John & gains a Battle Robot License, she becomes Akira's manager & helps to tune up his robots. ; : :: Hajime Akebono is a scientist who is Akira's grandfather. He is a famous Battle Robot Creator who created the robots that Akira uses, including DragoBurst along with Professor Maelstrom but DragonFlame, DragonFreezer and DragoBurst have gone berserk and gone against them years ago. Hajime later made the Animal Unit (made up of Bulion, Eaglearrow and Drimog) and then the Dino Unit (made up of Bonerex, Despector and Trihorn) and eventually the Cluster System, which is made up of Ryugu and Daigu, who combine to form Daigunder. He likes to travel to different places. It is to be noted that Bulion was Hajime's first powerful battle robot. ; :: A small robot that does the maintenance on Team Akira's robots. Daigunder Unit Ryugu Daigu/Daigunder A creation of Professor Hajime, is the Metamorphic Fusion of Ryugu and Daigu. Nicknamed the \\"King of the Battle Robots\\", he was equipped with special system called the Cluster System. Daigunder can attack his enemies with his Dragon Cannon (his finisher) and Dragon Sword. With Despector as his left arm he can perform the Echo Blast. When Both DragonFlame and DragonFreeze weapon use with Daigunder, it can use its most powerful attack, the Dragon Buster. He can also combine with DragoBurst. ; :: Ryugu is Akira's constant companion and as stubborn as he is. At first he refuses to obey Akira, until he sees Akira protect him. His attacks are Knight Slash and Knight Quake. Ryugu is a small knight robot. ; :: Daigu never fights unless fused with either Ryugu, Bulion or Bonerex. He can speak, but most often all he says is \\"Daigu!\\". He is a dragon robot. ; :: Part of the Daigunder Unit. One of two robots built by Professors Hajime and Maelstrom when they were partners. After finding out about Big Bang's true motives, DragonFlame and DragonFreezer ran off with their leader DragoBurst on a space station in outer space. Later on in the series, they joined Team Akira. DragonFlame's animal is a Fire Dragon and attacks with Magma Dynamic. DragonFlame can Armor Fuse and become a sword by saying Saber Change for either DragoBuster or Daigunder. Like Daigu, DragonFlame mostly says one word \\"Flame!\\". DragonFlame can also combine with DragonFreezeer to become a kind of two-headed dragon for Daigunder to ride on for flight. ; :: Part of the Daigunder Unit.

Bonerex can also Armor Fuse with DragoBurst to form . Megarex is the Power Fusion of Eaglearrow, Drimog, Despector, and Trihorn. This combination is seldom used, as it sometimes takes a lot of power out of them. Eaglearrow forms the chest armor. Drimog forms the lower torso and legs. Despector forms the back and wings. Trihorn forms the head, upper torso, arms and feet. Megarex is powerful enough to withstand Ginzan's Power Blast attack. ; : :: Member of the Animal Unit. He is one of the fliers of Team Akira since his animal form is an eagle. Constantly argues with Drimog. Attacks with Fire Arrow. ; : :: Member of the Animal Unit.

A running gag is that Akira cannot seem to get his name right. ; : :: A Battle Robot who worked for the mysterious Professor Maelstrom that attacked Daigunder on different occasions, nicknaming himself the \\"Ultimate Battle Robot\\". Although an enemy to Team Akira initially, he did team up with Akira and the Daigunder Unit for an Armor Fusion on some occasions, with an attack called Dragon Revolver The \\"Dragon Revolver\\" is one of the most powerful attacks, best remembered for almost destroying DragonFlame and DragonFreeze in space. Yet another notable Dragon Revolver attack was on Sacred Steel Tortoise, as it was successful in piercing its powerful shield. After learning about honor from Daigunder, he has begun to switch sides and eventually betrayed Professor Maelstrom when he learned his true intentions and how he felt that robots were merely tools. After fighting against Daigunder with Akira as his commander as part of a test, Ginzan decides to go away for a while and perhaps someday join Team Akira, as he now considers Akira his new commander. His animal form is a winged unicorn, his attacks include Spin Revolver and his best attack is Ultimate Revolver which forms the face of a Unicorn during its attack. After Maelstrom changed his ways, Ginzan returned to him along with Tigamaru and Rougamaru. ; : :: A robot built by Professors Hajime and Deikun when they were partners. After finding out about Maelstrom's true motives, he ran off and now he lives with his two companions DragonFlame and DragonFreezer on a space station in outer space. His ultimate goal is to get Daigunder on his team, destroy humanity and thereby establish a Robot Utopia. He can Armor Fuse with Daigunder to form with DragoFlame as a sword and DragoFreezer as a shield and attacks with his Burst Cannon and Dragon Nova. After some talking-to from Akira and Daigunder, DragoBurst realized the truth about humans and helped Team Akira destroy Maelstrom's giant turtle robot using the power of the Cluster System. His animal form is a Black Dragon and attacks with Buster Black Hole and Energy Fist. He is also capable of hypnotizing robots with his \\"Dragon Wave\\". =Villains= ; :: The primary antagonist of the series. Professor Maelstrom was once Professor Hajime's partner when he was originally known as Professor Deikun. Together they built DragoBurst. When DragoBurst found out that Professor Deikun planned to use him to take over the world, he fired at him thus destroying the laboratory and left. Many years later, he has returned complete with a metal eye due to the accident. He built Ginzan, Tigamaru, and Rogamaru to defeat Daigunder for unknown purposes. After Dragon Daigunder destroyed his ultimate Battle Robot, he changed his ways. His most powerful robotic invention was the \\"Sacred Steel Tortoise\\" as he thought it was the destined end of Daigunder and Dragonburst. ; : :: One of two robots who join up with Ginzan to destroy Daigunder.

Segmented by management and financial structure, these include 43 public universities, 103 private universities, 2 international universities, 31 specialized colleges, and 2 special universities. There are specialized universities in both categories offering courses principally in technological studies, medical studies, business studies and Islamic studies. There are two private universities dedicated solely to female students. The number of universities is growing mostly in and around the capital city of Dhaka. There are about 1688 colleges organized under the umbrella of Bangladesh National University ‚Äî one of the largest in the world. The Open University offers distance learning courses. There is a parallel religious high-ed education system. The University Grants Commission of Bangladesh (UGC) is the regulatory body of all the public (government funded) and private universities of Bangladesh. The Private University Act of 1992 paved the way for vigorous sprouting of private universities. 80% of its universities are in their infancy. There is a severed shortage in higher education capacity. The country is yet to have any research and education network (REN) or digital library consortium (DLC). Public universities Bangladesh has 45 public universities instructing the bulk of higher studies students. They that are funded by the government and managed as self-governed government institutions. =Criticism and controversy= (Most of following text is a decade old, and mostly misleading.) There has been much criticism and controversial issues around public universities in Bangladesh. Public universities had become places of political unrest and agitation. 12 of the public universities were reported to employ 1,994 unauthorized faculty and staff, resulting an annual overspend of 159,467,000 Bangladeshi taka borne by the government. All were warned by the UGC and apparently failed to respond to the warning. Student unrest has resulted in session jams and delays in holding examinations. During the presidency of Hossain Mohammad Ershad (1982‚Äì90) seven to eight years were being required to complete four-year courses. Private universities Private universities in Bangladesh came into being after institution of the Private University Act of 1992. As of 2019, over 103 of them had started. These universities follow an open credit system. =Criticism and controversy= There has been much controversy around the private universities and their practices. Eleven universities went operational without a UGC approval which was made a necessity under the Private University Act (1992). Twenty-seven private universities were found running without a vice-chancellor. Ten universities were issued a deadline of one year from the UGC to improve qualities. Eight universities the UGC of Bangladesh recommended for shutting down due to poor quality of academic standards. Some were served with show-cause notice by judicial authorities asking why it would not be closed down. At least eleven private universities introduced new academic courses without UGC approval. Others were found to deliver instructions in unauthorized courses and have illegal campuses.

It was well known as the main location for the UK Home Office between 1978 and 2004, when it was known as 50 Queen Anne's Gate; it now houses the Ministry of Justice, Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service and the Government Legal Department. The building is high, with 14 floors providing of office space.  History  The site was previously occupied by the 14-storey mansion block Queen Anne's Mansions, which was despised by some architectural commentators: Lord Reigate, speaking in the House of Lords in 1972 against the plans for the new building, used Nikolaus Pevsner's description \\"that irredeemable horror\\". However, the new building's architecture was not favourably received, either, owing to its scale and massing with protruding elements at the upper and lower floors, often being described as a Brutalist design: it was sometimes known to those who worked there as \\"the Lubyanka\\". Fodor's guide to London described it as \\"hulking\\", and Lord St John of Fawsley remarked that \\"Basil Spence's barracks in Hyde Park ruined that park; in fact, he has the distinction of having ruined two parks, because of his Home Office building, which towers above St James's Park.\\" The building originated as a speculative office development, but the Home Office moved in owing to lack of space in its previous headquarters in Whitehall. In spring 2005, the Home Office moved to a new purpose-built building at 2 Marsham Street designed by Terry Farrell. The Queen Anne's Gate building had major refurbishment work carried out on it, whilst being under the ownership of Land Securities. It has been the home of the Ministry of Justice and the Tribunals Service since 2008, with the building renamed 102 Petty France.

The film is loosely based on a real-life battle that took place at Elevation 3234 in early 1988, during the last large- scale Soviet military operation (Magistral) in Afghanistan. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot At a farewell ceremony in Krasnoyarsk, a band of young Soviet Army recruits is preparing to leave for military duty. Lyutyi (Artur Smolyaninov) one of the conscripts forms a group along with Chugun (Ivan Kokorin), Gioconda (Konstantin Kryukov), Ryaba (Mikhail Evlanov), Stas (Artyom Mikhalkov), Seryi (Ivan Nikolaev), and Vorobey (Aleksey Chadov). They have different talents and personalities that made it hard for them to form a bond with each other at first. On arrival at their bootcamp in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan, they meet another recruit, Pinochet (Soslan Fidarov), a Chechen recruit from Grozny, and their drill instructor, Senior Praporschik Dygalo, a seasoned, traumatized veteran of several tours in Afghanistan and a brutal trainer who treats the recruits harshly. During their training, the recruits overcome their differences and build bonds. Between the training sessions, they receive lessons in operating plastic explosives (which prompts some comic relief) and how to communicate with the locals in Afghanistan (underlining the vast cultural differences between Soviet and Afghan culture). During an orientation, a Soviet General asks if anyone in the VDV has changed their minds as they are about to be reassigned to another unit. Vorobey and Seryi initially intend to quit but halt their decision and remain. Later, Dygalo wakes up the recruits and beats everyone in a frantic manner. Although many claim that he is suffering from mental breakdown, they later learn that he wanted to go with them to Afghanistan but his request got rejected. The recruits then leave for Afghanistan via plane. On their arrival at Baghram air base, they are greeted by a group of VDV troops who have fulfilled their military service and are due to return home. One of the departing soldiers gives one of the new arrivals, Lyutyi, a talisman that he claims has kept him safe through several tours and multiple firefights. Homeward bound, the departing soldier's transport plane is hit by enemy fire from the nearby mountains and crashes, giving the new recruits their first taste of war. Shortly thereafter, the soldiers are assigned to the 9th company, where their trainer and drill instructor, Dygalo, had previously served. Pinochet and Ryaba however are reassigned to another unit, separating him from Lyutyi and his friends. Upon arriving there, they met Warrant Officer Pogrebnyak \\"Khokhol\\" (Fedor Bondarchuk) who is Dygalo's second-in-command. They also met Sergeant Afanasiev \\"Afanasiy\\" (Dmitry Mukhamadeev) and Sergeant Kurbanhaliev \\"Kurbashi\\" (Amadu Mamadakov) who were Dygalo's former companions as he was claimed to be discharged. Meanwhile, Chugun is given by Pomidor (Aleksandr Bashirov) the beaten up machine gun that Private Samylin used during his duty in Afghanistan. Khokhol tells about Dygalo's life on the company and tells his habits during his tours of duty in Afghanistan. Later the company leaves the headquarters to deliver supplies in an outpost of Soviet troops which would be the new component of the 9th company. While traveling through the base, Afanasiy also warns the new members of the company against their allies, the Afghan Army that is demoralized and weakened by mass desertion of its officers during the war. Upon delivering all the supplies needed and spending most of the night in the base, Patefon (Aleksandr Sheyn) invites the company for a shooting exercise. They come across in skirmish with a group of mujahideen led by Akhmed (Marat Gudiev), who insults with Patefon before exchanging fire. The next day Vorobey encounters Akhmed, holds him at gunpoint and is led to kill him, making him the first one on the company to kill a Mujahideen. The company then leaves for its next mission. The company is soon deployed to the front as a part of Operation Magistral, and receive the order to hold a nameless hill at all costs. They fortify the hill and turn it into a base. That night however, they are attacked by a group of mujahideen. Only Ryaba survives the attack as the far cordon was entirely annihilated by the attack, letting him speechless and crippled. To make sure that the mujahideen don't start an attack again, several soldiers are ordered to guard the hill. Stas however falls asleep during his duty and is beaten up by Khokhol, Afanasiy and Kurbashi. The next day, Gioconda is instructed to find matches. He encounters an old Afghan man, who, despite the language barrier, leads him to his village. Fearing an ambush, Gioconda arrives in the village and enters the house of the man. Upon seeing an old woman, says it's Haram. He is eventually given matches by a kid living there in return for food. As he leaves the village, he encounters members of the company led by Captain Bystrov (Aleksei Kravchenko), who were ready to storm the village. Several days later, a convoy arrives to the base, but is ambushed by the mujahideen. Several vehicles are destroyed and many soldiers killed. During the shootout, an injured Ryaba suffers from a mental breakdown and was is in the head as he yells to the company to stop firing. Captain Bystrov is also killed in action during the fight. Meanwhile, Khokhol, Lyutyi, and Vorobey attack the underground positions of the mujahideen, but are forced to return upon learning that their enemies are already in the village. The company then invades the village, which seems to be empty. Stas sees a young boy and decides to spare him, but as soon as he turns around he is shot in the back by the boy and dies shortly thereafter. The company is forced to leave as the village is shelled by BM-21 Grad rocket launchers, while the company lament the death of Stas. Later, Afanasiy leads some men of the company to steal food cans from a passing army convoy. The soldiers then tell each other their plans for the future after they are discharged from duty in Afghanistan. That night, the company celebrates New Year's Eve by listening to Mikhail Gorbachev's speech on radio, drink to their fallen comrades. Pinochet then arrives in the company's base to reunite with his friends: he got into trouble with his unit and was thus reassigned to the 9th company. Welcoming him, the company then starts the party by dancing to some Soviet pop Music. The next morning, while the entire company is asleep, Gioconda goes outside of the base to draw the landscape. As a large pocket of mujahideen arrives, he is immediately shot in the head and cannot warn the others of the upcoming assault. Reacting to this surprise attack, the 9th company fires back but are shelled by mortars. As he tries to ask for reinforcements by radio, Patefon is killed by a mortar shell which disrupts the communication lines. The company is able to return to the trenches and engage the mujahideen, Khokhol orders some of the men to shell the enemy positions with mortars but Khokhol's position is hit by a rocket that kills two of his men and abandoned any hopes to disrupt the enemy lines. Soon, the mujahidden break the line and hand in hand combat ensues. Another shelling begins, a rocket kills Khokhol while Kurbashi is killed by a bullet. During the fight, Lyutyi along with the surviving members of the company fought their way to prevent the mujahideen from launching a complete ambush on the convoy. Vorobey is hit on his knees while fighting, unable to make his way to the lines of his comrades, Chugun uses his machine gun to attack the mujahideen in hopes to cover him but is killed instantly. As he is approached by mujahideen fighters, Vorobey detonates a grenade to himself. This leads Lyutyi to fearlessly charge to the enemy lines with Samylin's machine gun along with the company. They briefly gain the upper hand and are able to push the fighters back in their positions. Stranded with low ammunition and no means of communications, the company gathers: only seven of them survived and all officers are dead. Lyutyi along with Afanasiy leads the last men of the company in defense of the hill. They encounter the last fighters and fearlessly fight them till the last man when Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships arrive and kill the remaining Afghan fighters. Afanasiy is shot on the chest while the last of the men are killed in the gunfight. Lyutyi is the only one from the company who remains alive. Speechless and severely crippled, he tells the Colonel (Andrey Krasko) that the convoy now may pass as the 9th company has fulfilled their duty and mission. The colonel says that there will be no convoy as the Soviets are already withdrawing from Afghanistan and wonders why they haven't heard the orders on the radio. Upon realizing what happened to the 9th company, the colonel comforts him. Lyutyi passes through the dead bodies of the entire company and removes the Talisman from his neck as he kneels to ground crying. Later on February 15, 1989, a column of BTR-80 is seen leaving Afghanistan. Lyutyi is in one of the vehicles along with other soldiers who had fulfilled their duty in Afghanistan. He expressed his sympathy as two years later the country they have been fighting for will vanish (Soviet Union). He also tells the fate of most of the people in the military. This includes Senior Praporschik Dygalo being reassigned to Tula to train recruits, who then dies on a night march a year later of a stroke. Snow White and her mother along with other Russian families remain in Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan until they all disappear without a trace. He also says that from years later the veterans like him in the conflict will be scattered ruthlessly by the new life. He concludes by saying that the 9th Company won its own war.

Early career Ter Braak was born in Eibergen and grew up in the town of Tiel where he was an exemplary student. He went on to the University of Amsterdam where he majored in Dutch and History. He was a regular contributor to the student magazine Propria Cures and involved himself in the study of film (then a very young discipline). Together with Joris Ivens, Menno ter Braak was also a founder of the Filmliga (Movie League), an organisation for the study of animated film. He completed a Ph.D. dissertation on the medieval emperor Otto III and consecutively worked as a teacher in a number of secondary schools. Forum movement In 1932 ter Braak, together with Edgar du Perron and , started the literary magazine Forum which proved to be one of the most important literary periodicals in the Dutch-speaking world (it expressly involved Flemish intellectuals as well) in the nineteen-thirties. Forum is widely considered a bulwark of cultural elitism, advocating a high cultural level of discourse, a rational form of literary criticism, consequent individualism and a stern disapproval of all intellectual ornamentation. ‚ÄúVent boven vorm‚Äù (loosely translated: ‚Äòpersonality over form‚Äô) was the catchword of the Forum movement, and Multatuli was one of its most important paragons. Political involvement In 1933 ter Braak, then living in The Hague, joined the Dutch liberal daily Het Vaderland (the Fatherland) as a literary affairs editor and was one of the first Dutchmen to understand the looming threat of Nazism. It is in these years that he started het Comit√© van Waakzaamheid (the Committee for Vigilance). As a public intellectual, he is most famous for his essays, most of which deal with European culture, politics, or a mixture of the two. He is distinctly influenced by Nietzsche and his style is deliberately paradoxical. Later writing In his last, and best-known essays he chastises those who would subject themselves to \\"higher\\" and \\"spiritual\\" values, unmasking the hierarchies behind those values who are working to further their own agenda. Against this subjection to extraneous authorities and false values, ter Braak posits the individualist ideal of the honn√™te homme, the \\"Man of Integrity\\" who will not conform himself to other people's expectations and systems. A born polemicist, he managed to find himself a diverse group of opponents and by the end of his life had entered into polemics, some of which were hostile with the self-proclaimed representatives of what he considered to be \\"nebulous collectivisms\\" such as Catholicism, liberal humanism, Marxism and fascism. Death Towards the end of his life he became increasingly involved in the growing anti-fascist movement in the Netherlands. When the Second World War broke out in 1939 he fell into a deep depression. Four days after Nazi Germany had invaded the Netherlands, on 14 May 1940, after a failed attempt to flee to England, Menno ter Braak committed suicide in The Hague by using a sedative, combined with an injection (most likely administered by his brother Wim ter Braak, who was a doctor) of poison. He died on the day the Luftwaffe carpet bombed his former hometown Rotterdam. His influence remained fairly large and lasted well into the 1950s; during the fifties his influence began to wane but a number of literary periodicals, especially Libertinage and Tirade remained faithful to a number of ter Braak's ideas.

Life  Coppi was born in Berlin, and grew up in Mitte area. Her mother ran a small leather shop. After finishing vocational school, she worked as a language teaching assistant through much of the 1930s. Hilde Rake was working in Berlin as a clerk at the Reich Insurance Institute for Clerical Workers when she got to know Hans Coppi, who had only just been released from prison. Already by 1933, Rake had had contact with members of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Together, Hilde and Hans Coppi -- who wed on 14 June 1941 -- hid persecution victims of the Nazi r√©gime. During the war, Hilde Coppi listened to \\"Voice of Russia\\" (ie Radio Moscow) and shared the information broadcast over the radio with the Red Orchestra and other resistance groups. She also relayed greetings and any other signs of continued life heard on Radio Moscow from German prisoners of war to their kin. This was especially important, as Nazi propaganda had it that Soviet troops shot their enemies out of hand, and did not take prisoners. Moreover, she busied herself with broadcasting her group's messages through leaflets and stickers. She conducted a sticker campaign against the Nazis' anti-Soviet propaganda exhibition called \\"Soviet Paradise\\". Hilde Coppi and her husband were both arrested on 12 September 1942, along with Hans' parents and brother, and Hilde's mother. Hilde was pregnant by this time, later giving birth to the couple's son at the Berlin Women's Prison on 27 November. On 22 December 1942, her husband was put to death, and Hilde, too, was sentenced to death in the new year, on 20 January. A petition for clemency was made in her case in July, but Hitler refused to grant it. The execution was delayed until August, so that she could nurse her child. On 5 August 1943, Hilde Coppi was beheaded at Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin.  Literature  * Gilles Perrault: Auf den Spuren der Roten Kapelle.

Designed and programmed by Rex Battenberg, it was available both as a conversion kit and full arcade cabinet. An Atari 5200 port was released in 1983. Like Robotron: 2084 (1982), but preceding the release of that game, the controls are a pair of 8-directional joysticks: one for moving, one for shooting. Space Dungeon is one of the first twin-stick shooters, after Taito's earlier games Gun Fight and Boot Hill, and released the same year as Mars from Artic Electronics.  Gameplay  Arcade screenshot Each level of Space Dungeon consists of 36 rooms arranged in a six-by-six grid. Rooms are connected by open doorways of various sizes. One room in each level is the entrance, where the player begins, and another is the \\"Collect Bonus\\" room. Other rooms may or may not contain laser defenses, hostile aliens, or various bits of treasure. The goal in each level is to navigate using an automap to the room containing the \\"Collect Bonus\\" area, visiting as many rooms and collecting as much treasure as possible along the way. The player's only weapon is a laser cannon, which fires a pulsing, solid beam in any of eight directions. Higher scores are awarded for exiting each level with more treasures. A 10,000-point bonus is awarded if the player visits every single room on the level, whether or not all treasures on the level have been collected. Since an extra ship is awarded to the player every 10,000 points, this, and the large point values of the treasures (especially the later ones) created an interesting tension between securing the treasures already collected or risking losing ships to acquire more. If the player's ship collides with an enemy or any of their spore shots before reaching the \\"Collect Bonus\\" cube, all collected treasure is dropped in the room where the ship was destroyed. This room is designated on the map by an \\"X\\". = Levels = The game counts from level 1 to 99, and upon completing 99, rolls over to zero. Levels two through nine, and then levels that are a multiple of one hundred, are preceded by a rhyme: * The Thief's in view on level 2 * More to see on level 3 * Watch each door on level 4 * Stay alive on level 5 * Watch for tricks on level 6 * It's not heaven on level 7 * Meet thy fate on level 8 * You're doing fine on level 9 On reaching level 10, the game then displays \\"Sorry. No more rhymes.\\" No further messages appear until the player rolls- over the level counter by completing level 99. At level 100, the level counter resets to zero, and the message displayed is \\"You're a hero on level zero.\\" Thus this same \\"level zero\\" message will be repeated every hundredth level. =Enemies= * Piker (100 points). Slow-moving, spiked ships that attempt to collide with the player's ship. The player's laser must hit the core of a Piker to destroy it. Shooting of its spikes [confusingly called a \\"Piker (shield)\\"] awards 10 points each. If a Piker is left with its core intact, even if some of its spikes have been destroyed, then the entire Piker will be restored if the player leaves the room and returns. * Corner Zapper (25 points). These always appears in sets of four, one in each corner of the room. They fire beams randomly and intermittently between different pairs, and the player's ship is destroyed if it gets caught in the crossfire. If any Corner Zappers are left intact when the player exit a room, all will spontaneously regenerate upon the player's return to that room. * Deathsquare (25 points). Slow-moving obstacles. A single shot will destroy them. * Guard (125 points). These red creatures tend to be found near treasure items, and mimic the player's movements, though at a slower speed, while shooting spores at the player. * Executioner (125 points). These creates actively chase the player, firing spores and attempting to collide with the player's ship. * Enforcer (250 points). These enemies, looking vaguely like a smiley face, will materialize in a room and charge at the player. It takes several shots to destroy an Enforcer, making it a high-priority target. If the player moves into another room with an Enforcer on the screen, the Enforcer will appear in the new room at the same location, and resume its charge. * Spore Case (500 points).

The game cartridge came prepackaged with a dual- controller holder, allowing players to snap two stock controllers in and play like in the arcade. The game differs from the arcade original in that most of the objects are approximately four times the size, spores can be launched by enemies only in the eight ordinal directions, and the enemies are less aggressive. Reception The Atari 5200 version of Space Dungeon was reviewed by Video magazine in its \\"Arcade Alley\\" column where it was described as \\"such a triumph that not even the questionable 5200 controllers can spoil the fun.\\" Dawn Gordon of MicroKids called the port \\"yet another Atari Supersystem standout.\\" Legacy Space Dungeon was later released as part of the PlayStation Portable collection Taito Legends Power-Up.

He is the co-founder, band leader and principal songwriter of the internationally acclaimed band The Cat Empire, who have made multi-platinum albums, and are the 2006 winner of the World Music Aria Award for their album Cities. Early life and family Felix Riebl was born in Melbourne to an Austrian father and an Australian mother. He spent his childhood living in Europe before moving back to Australia when he was in his early teens. Riebl's childhood was surrounded by music: his uncle, Thomas, was a professor of viola at the Mozarteum Salzburg, and family members, including his cousin Misty who was an aspiring artist, studying at Victorian College of the Arts would regularly take him to sit amongst the Vienna Philharmonic. Of his family, Riebl said in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald that > \\"My sister is a classical pianist, my brother's a singer, and dad's brother > is quite a famous viola player in Austria. We listened to a lot of music and > we danced a lot and sang a lot. The older I get, the realisation comes that > a lot of this starts early in the family.\\" Riebl's younger brother, Max (b. 1991), sang and played trumpet on the song \\"Miserere\\" on The Cat Empire's second album Two Shoes. Career Riebl co- founded The Cat Empire with Ollie McGill and Ryan Monro in 1999. He was the primary songwriter on the band's self-entitled debut album, including being the sole writer of their first single, \\"Hello\\". In addition to his role as a musician in the band, Riebl had helped produce the albums Two Shoes and Cities. Outside of his work with The Cat Empire, Riebl has composed music for the Australia Day Spectacular at Darling Harbour in 2013, the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne 2006, The Dream Festival on the Yarra River in 2009, and Australia's first ever White Night in Melbourne in 2013. In 2011 he released his debut solo album Into the Rain. The album featured a number of original compositions, as well as a cover of Bruce Springsteen's \\"I'm on Fire\\", whom Riebl cites alongside Mark Knopfler and Bob Dylan as influences on the album. The album was a moderate success, peaking at No. 61 on the Australian iTunes albums chart. In December 2015, he also released the four- track EP Lonely Truth, as a teaser for his second solo album. The song \\"Crocodiles\\", inspired by a trip to Timor-Leste, was released as a single in January 2016. In January 2016, the Pilbara Project choir premiered Riebl's song-cycle based on the Pilbara. Riebl released his second solo album Paper Doors on 2 September 2016 to rave reviews. Rolling Stone gave the album 3.5 stars out of 4, praising Riebl as \\"far more than the frontman for one of Australia's most enduring party bands\\". Paper Doors peaked at No. 46 on the ARIA Charts and at No. 31 on Australian iTunes. In January 2017, Riebl released the tribute song \\"Ms Dhu\\" and an accompanying music video, following the release of the inquest into the death of Ms Dhu. Personal life Riebl resides in Fitzroy. Politically, he aligns himself with The Greens. He is an ambassador for the Indigenous Literacy Foundation, alongside authors Richard Flanagan and David Malouf, and didgeridoo player William Barton. Riebl has also been actively involved in campaigning for 350.org, Market Forces, and the Australian Conservation Foundation on raising climate change awareness and action.

Origin of the poem and song One day Sargent was walking on The Battery in New York City watching the ships enter the harbour. This scene inspired Sargent to write a poem, which Russell later put to music. The song soon became popular in both the United Kingdom and the United States. History of cultural uses of the song At an 1851 celebration in Salem, Massachusetts, the Boston Cadet Band gave the new clipper ship Witch of the Wave a lively sendoff by striking up \\"A Life on the Ocean Wave\\" as the SS R. B. Forbes towed the new clipper out to set sail for Boston. In 1882, the Deputy Adjutant General of the Royal Marines requested that the Bandmaster of each Royal Marine Division (Portsmouth, Plymouth, Chatham) submit an arrangement for a new regimental march for the Corps, if possible based on a naval song. Kappey, the Bandmaster of the Chatham Division, submitted an arrangement of \\"A Life on the Ocean Wave\\", with an eight bar trio from \\"The Sea\\" by Sigismund Neukomm, which was authorised for use as the regimental quick march of the Corps of Royal Marines in 1882. In the United States, it is the official march of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. In Portugal, it was adopted as the march of the Armed Forces Movement (MFA) that overthrew the dictatorship on 25 April 1974. The tune, played by the Band of the Royal Marines, is played over the opening credits of the 1992 BBC television film An Ungentlemanly Act, about the first days of the invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982. The tune, slightly altered, provides the music for the Latter-day Saint hymn \\"Who's On The Lord's Side?\\"\\"Who's On The Lord's Side?\\" (Hymn 260), Hymns of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1985.

Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994), was a United States Supreme Court copyright law case that established that a commercial parody can qualify as fair use.. This case established that the fact that money is made by a work does not make it impossible for fair use to apply; it is merely one of the components of a fair use analysis. History The members of the rap music group 2 Live Crew--Luke (Luther Campbell), Fresh Kid Ice, Mr. Mixx and Brother Marquis--composed a song called \\"Pretty Woman,\\" a parody based on Roy Orbison's rock ballad, \\"Oh, Pretty Woman.\\" The group's manager asked Acuff- Rose Music if they could get a license to use Orbison's tune for the ballad to be used as a parody. Acuff-Rose Music refused to grant the band a license but 2 Live Crew nonetheless produced and released the parody. Almost a year later, after nearly a quarter of a million copies of the recording had been sold, Acuff-Rose sued 2 Live Crew and its record company, Luke Skyywalker Records, for copyright infringement. The District Court granted summary judgment for 2 Live Crew, holding that their song was a parody that made fair use of the original song under ¬ß 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. ¬ß 107). The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that the commercial nature of the parody rendered it presumptively unfair under the first of four factors relevant under ¬ß 107; that, by taking the \\"heart\\" of the original and making it the \\"heart\\" of a new work, 2 Live Crew had taken too much under the third ¬ß 107 factor; and that market harm for purposes of the fourth ¬ß107 factor had been established by a presumption attaching to commercial uses. Holding The Supreme Court held that 2 Live Crew's commercial parody may be a fair use within the meaning of ¬ß 107. Justice Souter began by describing the inherent tension created by the need to simultaneously protect copyrighted material and allow others to build upon it, quoting Lord Ellenborough: \\"While I shall think myself bound to secure every man in the enjoyment of his copyright, one must not put manacles upon science.\\" The Court elaborated on this tension, looking to Justice Story's analysis in Folsom v. Marsh, 9 F. Cas. 342 (C.C.D. Mass. 1841), where he stated, \\"look to the nature and objects of the selections made, the quantity and value of the materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work.\\" This analysis was eventually codified in the Copyright Act of 1976 in ¬ß 107 as follows: > Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a > copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or > phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes > such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple > copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement > of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any > particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include-- > > (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of > a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; > (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; > (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the > copyrighted work as a whole; and > (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the > copyrighted work. The Supreme Court then found the aforementioned factors must be applied to each situation on a case by case basis. '\\"The fact that parody can claim legitimacy for some appropriation does not, of course, tell either parodist or judge much about where to draw the line. Like a book review quoting the copyrighted material criticized, parody may or may not be fair use, and petitioner's suggestion that any parodic use is presumptively fair has no more justification in law or fact than the equally hopeful claim that any use for news reporting should be presumed fair.\\" When looking at the purpose and character of 2 Live Crew's use, the Court found that the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of the other three factors. The court found that, in any event, a work's commercial nature is only one element of the first factor enquiry into its purpose and character, quoting Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417. The Supreme Court found the Court of Appeals analysis as running counter to this proposition. Justice Souter then moved onto the second ¬ß 107 factor, \\"the nature of the copyrighted work\\", finding it has little merit in resolving this and other parody cases, since the artistic value of parodies is often found in their ability to invariably copy popular works of the past. The Court did find the third factor integral to the analysis, finding that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that, as a matter of law, 2 Live Crew copied excessively from the Orbison original. Souter reasoned that the \\"amount and substantiality\\" of the portion used by 2 Live Crew was reasonable in relation to the band's purpose in creating a parody of \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\". The majority reasoned \\"even if 2 Live Crew's copying of the original's first line of lyrics and characteristic opening bass riff may be said to go to the original's 'heart,' that heart is what most readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim.\\" The Supreme Court then looked to the new work as a whole, finding that 2 Live Crew thereafter departed markedly from the Orbison lyrics, producing otherwise distinctive music. Looking at the final factor, the Supreme Court found that the Court of Appeals erred in finding a presumption or inference of market harm (such as there had been in Sony). Parodies in general, the Court said, will rarely substitute for the original work, since the two works serve different market functions. While Acuff-Rose found evidence of a potential \\"derivative\\" rap market in the very fact that 2 Live Crew recorded a rap parody of \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" and another rap group sought a license to record a rap derivative, the Court found no evidence that a potential rap market was harmed in any way by 2 Live Crew's parodic rap version. In fact, the Court found that it was unlikely that any artist would find parody a lucrative derivative market, noting that artists \\"ask for criticism, but only want praise.\\" The Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals and remanded the case. On remand, the parties settled the case out of court. According to press reports, under terms of the settlement, Acuff-Rose dismissed its lawsuit, and 2 Live Crew agreed to license the sale of its parody of the song. Although Acuff-Rose stated that it was paid under the settlement, the terms were not otherwise disclosed.Acuff-Rose Settles Suit with Rap Group, The Commercial Appeal (Memphis), June 5, 1996. Notably, Justice Souter attached the lyrics of both songs as appendixes to his majority opinion for the Court. As a result, both songs were reproduced in the United States Reports along with the rest of the opinion, and may now be found in every major American law library. See also * Berlin v. E.C.

It contains singles \\"Just the Girl\\", \\"Catch Your Wave\\" and \\"Say Goodnight\\" and an iTunes single, \\"Pop Princess\\". Background The album's title refers to the band's Boston house on Imrie Street where they lived while writing the album and attending Berklee School of Music. The album's musical style of \\"retro new wave and power pop\\" was inspired by Cheap Trick, the Beach Boys, and the Knack. Commercial performance The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 15 on September 3, 2005, marking the highest-ranking debut for any pop or rock band that year, selling 51,541 copies. It was also the best debut in Lava Records' history. Billboard Melinda Newman opined that the grassroots following the band had developed online responsible for the high debut. In its second week, the album dropped to number 28. In an era of declining album sales, the band moved 268,000 copies of the album by January 2006, considered disappointing in comparison to the sales of lead single \\"Just the Girl\\". \\"Part of me likes the idea of being a singles band,\\" said Joe Guese to Rolling Stone at the time. Reception Greetings from Imrie House received mixed reviews. Rolling Stone Barry Walters deemed the album and group \\"Simultaneously retro, current, mainstream-minded and knowing.\\" Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly called it \\"insanely catchy blend,\\" combining \\"guitar crunch, pop hooks, and Queen-worthy vocal harmonies.\\" John D. Luerssen of AllMusic predicted the band would be considered \\"disposable,\\" while also attracting \\"instant acclaim\\" from other quarters.

It is also considered to be much better than its Ottawa competition, the Ottawa River Canor Club (ORCC). The club is located at Mooney's Bay, where the Rideau Canal splits away from the river prior to joining up with the Ottawa River. History The club was founded in 1902 as the Rideau Aquatic Club with a clubhouse on the Rideau Canal near the Exhibition Grounds designed by Moses Chamberlain Edey in 1904-5.Moses Chamberlain Edey Dictionary of Architects in Canada http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1549 A memorial brass plaque on a flag pole is dedicated to the memory of the members who fell during the First World War. In 1981, this memorial was rededicated to include the members of the Club who fell during the Second World War. The clubhouse was on the canal at Fifth Avenue in the Glebe until the 1940s, when it was destroyed by winter ice. In 1946, the club reorganized as the Rideau Canoe Club and in the following year, relocated to its current location at Mooney's Bay. Club facilities include a clubhouse with five boat bays and a repair shop, and two 'annex' boat storage buildings set somewhat back from the water.

Paul Clare Reinert, S.J., (August 12, 1910 - July 22, 2001) was the president of Saint Louis University for twenty-five years and a community leader in St. Louis, Missouri, USA.  Life and works  Paul Reinert was born in Boulder, Colorado, on August 12, 1910, to Francis and Emma Reinert. In 1927, he entered the Society of Jesus. Two of his brothers, James and Carl, also became Jesuit priests. Paul was ordained to the priesthood in 1940 and received both an A.B. (1927) and a M.A. (1934) from Saint Louis University. He then served as register at St. Mary‚Äôs College in Kansas before earning a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago (1944). After completing his Ph.D., he returned to Saint Louis University to serve as the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences (1944‚Äì1948), vice-president (1948‚Äì1949), and president (1949‚Äì1974). After retiring from the presidency, he served as chancellor (1974‚Äì1991) and chancellor emeritus (1991‚Äì2001) until his death in 2001. During his twenty- five year tenure as president, Reinert transformed the university and was a vocal advocate for social justice. Reinert‚Äôs presidency of Saint Louis University marked a seminal period in the history of the university, Catholic education, and American education in general. He faced an increased post-war enrollment in higher education and the necessary changes in curriculum. Under his administration, the university admitted women as regular students. In addition, while a junior administrator, he worked for the admission of the first African-American students to the university in 1944. Saint Louis University thus became the first historically white university in a former slave state to admit African-American students.\\"Pressure Grows to Have Catholic College Doors Open to Negroes\\", Pittsburgh Courier, 19 Feb. 1944, p. 1; \\"St. Louis U. Lifts Color Bar: Accepts Five Negroes for Summer Session\\", Pittsburgh Courier, 6 May 1944, p. 1. As the country‚Äôs cities faced increased racial tensions and urban universities dealt with the dilemma of the \\"white flight\\", Reinert committed the institution to remain in urban St. Louis, as other American universities left their urban origins. As a result, Reinert became a leader in the revitalization of the inner city of St. Louis and the promotion of higher education on the divide line between the north, black part of the city and south, all-white neighborhoods. His 1958 appointment to the Missouri Governor‚Äôs Committee of Education beyond High School eventually led to the formation of the St. Louis Junior College District in 1962 upon the recommendation of Dr. Ernest V. Hollis of the U.S. Department of Education and Edward B. Shils. He also was the member of other important state, federal, and Catholic education committees that established policies that set the standard for education in his time. 280px As a national leader in Catholic education, Reinert remained confident in the advantages that private Catholic colleges and universities offered to their communities. He sought to expand Saint Louis University‚Äôs campus and to create programs that would attract minority students to a historically white university. After building the spacious Pius XII library on campus, he negotiated the microfilming of the Vatican's rare manuscripts collection, adding to the research facilities of the university. Under Reinert‚Äôs direction in 1967, Saint Louis University became the first Catholic university to include lay member on its board of trustees. This reorganization initiated a trend that transformed Catholic higher education in America. In addition to this reorganization, he appointed lay professionals to high-ranking administrative positions in the university. Even though critics believed that Reinert‚Äôs decision conflicted with his position as a Jesuit and diluted the university‚Äôs Jesuit nature, Reinert and others believed that the changes both reaffirmed the Ignatian educational mission and broadened the university‚Äôs vision for the future. Moreover, his reorganization of the university demonstrated the increased status of the university and its dedication to serving the community. He continued to serve the community after his retirement as president in 1974. In 1962, across Grand Boulevard from the University 22 acres were purchased to accommodate Busch Student Center, sports fields, a large classroom building, and a three-building science complex with a large hall under its courtyard. In 1969 an SLU campus was opened in Madrid. Reinert‚Äôs publications include two books concerning the status of Catholic higher education, The Urban Catholic University (1970) and To Turn the Tide (1972), and a history of the university since the war, Seasons of Change: Reflections on Half a Century of Saint Louis University, co-authored with Paul Shore (1996). Reinert died July 22, 2001, in St. Louis, Missouri. Reinert Hall, a residence hall at St. Louis University, is named in his honor, in addition to the Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence. For his work, Reinert has been honored with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

As a player Morrow operated as a midfielder from 1988 until 2003, playing in the Premier League for Arsenal and in Major League Soccer for Dallas Burn. He also played in the Football League for Reading, Watford, Barnet, Queens Park Rangers and Peterborough United. He received 39 caps for Northern Ireland, scoring once before moving into management with FC Dallas in 2004. He later served as International Partnerships ‚Äì Performance Supervisor at Arsenal from 2008 to 2019. Club career =Arsenal= Morrow first played for Bangor as youth, before joining Arsenal in July 1987. A versatile utility man, who could play at full back, centre back or midfielder, Morrow had loan spells at Reading, Watford and Barnet, before making his debut for Arsenal as a substitute in a First Division match on 8 April 1992 against Norwich City, in place of the injured Nigel Winterburn. Morrow became a semi-regular in 1992‚Äì93. He played most of his matches in midfield, replacing the injured Paul Davis as Arsenal reached the League Cup and FA Cup finals. Morrow started the League Cup final against Sheffield Wednesday; after falling behind to a John Harkes goal, Arsenal equalised through Paul Merson, and then Merson set up Morrow to score the winner (which was also his first for the club). In the celebrations after the match, Arsenal skipper Tony Adams attempted to pick up Morrow and parade him on his shoulders, but Adams slipped and Morrow awkwardly hit the ground. He broke his arm and had to be rushed to hospital. As a result, Morrow missed the rest of that season, including the FA Cup Final (also against Sheffield Wednesday), where Arsenal completed the Cup Double. Before the final kicked off, Morrow received his League Cup winners' medal. Morrow was fit enough by the start of the next season but played only 13 matches, compared to 25 the previous season. One of those was the scene of an Arsenal triumph, the club's Cup Winners' Cup Final win over Parma. In an Arsenal midfield depleted of John Jensen and David Hillier, Morrow made his first appearance in the competition that season partnering 20-year-old Ian Selley in central midfield as Arsenal beat Parma 1‚Äì0 with an Alan Smith goal. He had nearly left the club in March 1994, following an approach from the Premier League's bottom club Swindon Town, but the transfer fell through and he signed a new contract with Arsenal, where he spent three more years. Morrow went on to play over 20 matches the following season, including a second Cup Winners' Cup final (which Arsenal lost to Real Zaragoza). He scored his second Arsenal goal in the League Cup once again against Sheffield Wednesday, and scored his first Arsenal league goal in a 3‚Äì1 defeat at Blackburn Rovers, who won the Premier League that season. However, he never found favour under new Arsenal boss Bruce Rioch, who only gave the Irishman five matches in 1995‚Äì96. =Queens Park Rangers= After the arrival of Ars√®ne Wenger in 1996, Morrow was told he was surplus to requirements at Highbury, and he was loaned to Queens Park Rangers in March 1997; the deal was made permanent that summer. He played 85 games for Arsenal in total, scoring three goals. At QPR, Morrow was initially a regular, but the club struggled, going from contenders for promotion to the Premiership to facing relegation to the Second Division. Injuries to his shoulder ligaments ruled Morrow out for most of the 1999‚Äì2000 season, and he lost his place in the side. Morrow later had a loan spell at Peterborough United, but it did not become permanent, and he was released on a free transfer in the summer of 2001. =Dallas Burn= Struggling to find a club in the UK, Morrow moved to the United States to play for Major League Soccer side Dallas Burn. He spent two seasons at Dallas (who renamed themselves FC Dallas in 2004), before retiring because of a persistent neck injury. International career Morrow made his full international debut for Northern Ireland, in May 1990 against Uruguay; he went on to win 39 caps for his country from then until 1999. Managerial & further career On 3 February 2004, Morrow was named as an assistant coach to FC Dallas but resigned in late May due to personal reasons. However, he returned to the club on 27 January 2005 under coach Colin Clarke. When Clarke was fired on 7 November 2006, Morrow was named interim head coach. On 11 December 2006, FC Dallas removed the 'interim' from his title. Morrow was fired as coach on 20 May 2008. On 12 September 2008 Morrow returned to Arsenal as International Partnerships ‚Äì Performance Supervisor, managing Arsenal's international partnerships, which included the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer in the United States, BEC Tero of Thailand and Ho√†ng Anh Gia Lai of Vietnam, and assisting Arsenal's academies in countries such as Egypt and Ghana. He has also worked as a live match analyst for Arsenal's online webcasts. He left Arsenal in 2019 after a staff shake-up amid the coaching staff. References External links Steve Morrow UpThePosh!

The only abnormal finding in this disease is a thinning of the basement membrane of the glomeruli in the kidneys. Its importance lies in the fact that it has a benign prognosis, with patients maintaining a normal kidney function throughout their lives. Signs and symptoms Most patients with thin basement membrane disease are incidentally discovered to have microscopic hematuria on urinalysis. The blood pressure, kidney function, and the urinary protein excretion are usually normal. Mild proteinuria (less than 1.5 g/day) and hypertension are seen in a small minority of patients. Frank hematuria and loin pain should prompt a search for another cause, such as kidney stones or loin pain-hematuria syndrome. Also, there are no systemic manifestations, so presence of hearing impairment or visual impairment should prompt a search for hereditary nephritis such as Alport syndrome. Genetics The molecular basis for thin basement membrane disease has yet to be elucidated fully; however, defects in type IV collagen have been reported in some families. Some individuals with TBMD are thought to be carriers for genes that cause Alport syndrome. Diagnosis Thin basement membrane disease must be differentiated from the other two common causes of glomerular hematuria, IgA nephropathy and Alport syndrome. The history and presentation are helpful in this regard: *In Alport syndrome, there is often a family history of kidney failure, which may be associated with hearing impairment. Also, males tend to be more affected as Alport syndrome is X-linked in most cases. *In IgA nephropathy, episodes of frank hematuria are more common, and a family history is less common. A kidney biopsy is the only way to diagnose thin basement membrane disease. It reveals thinning of the glomerular basement membrane from the normal 300 to 400 nanometers (nm) to 150 to 250 nm. However, a biopsy is rarely done in cases where the patient has isolated microscopic hematuria, normal kidney function, and no proteinuria. The prognosis is excellent in this setting unless the clinical manifestations progress, as occurs in most males and some females with Alport syndrome and many patients with IgA nephropathy. Treatment Most patients with thin basement membrane disease need only reassurance. Indeed, this disease was previously referred to as \\"benign familial hematuria\\" because of its usually benign course. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been suggested to reduce the episodes of hematuria, though controlled studies are lacking. Treating co-existing hypercalciuria and hyperuricosuria will also be helpful in reducing hematuria. The molecular basis for thin basement membrane disease has yet to be elucidated fully; however, defects in the gene encoding the a4 chain of type IV collagen have been reported in some families. Prognosis Overall, most people with thin basement membrane disease have an excellent prognosis. Some reports, however, suggest that a minority might develop hypertension. Thin basement membrane disease may co- exist with other kidney diseases, which may in part be explained by the high prevalence of thin basement membrane disease.

Virginia and North Carolina also have extensive rivalries in several other sports. The South's Oldest Rivalry is so named not only because of the extraordinary age and length of the series, but because of the immense early success of both programs and the great regional importance of their earliest games: between 1889 and 1902, either Virginia or North Carolina claimed a southern championship in twelve out of fourteen years. The preeminence of this rivalry in early southern football is demonstrated by the fact that North Carolina beat both Georgia and Auburn in their own states by the combined score of 82‚Äì0, before edging out Virginia by four points and claiming the 1898 southern championship. When Virginia had first played one of those \\"Deep South\\" teams the year prior, a Georgia fullback actually died in Atlanta. Virginia had the upper hand overall in the early rivalry with North Carolina, and therefore the entire region, claiming no fewer than twelve southern championships through 1908. The game was still considered a regional attraction in 1928, with a sitting President and First Lady making the eight-hour round trip from the White House to attend the sold- out rivalry game in Charlottesville on that Thanksgiving Day. The South's Oldest Rivalry started 1-1 after playing twice in 1892 (once in Atlanta). All games played between 1893 and 1916 were at \\"neutral site\\" locations in the Commonwealth of Virginia -- Richmond and Norfolk -- but after a two-year hiatus for World War I, the two programs have played every year since 1919 and have alternated between their home stadiums in Chapel Hill (at Kenan Memorial Stadium since 1927) and Charlottesville (at Scott Stadium since 1931). Between 1910 and 1950, the South's Oldest Rivalry was consistently played as the last game of the season for both programs, and nearly always on Thanksgiving Day. Virginia‚ÄìCarolina is, as of 2018, tied with the Georgia‚ÄìAuburn game as the second-most played rivalry game of the Power Five conferences, after the Paul Bunyon's Axe rivalry between Wisconsin and Minnesota. Among Football Bowl Subdivision rivalry games, this game is also tied with Auburn‚ÄìGeorgia as the most played rivalry in the South, but moreover has been played five more times than the Army‚ÄìNavy Game to stand as the most-played FBS rivalry game in the East.  Series history  Long being the most played game among all Football Bowl Subdivision series in the Southeastern United States, the annual game became known over the years simply as the South's Oldest Rivalry. It is also the oldest series of the highest division on the eastern seaboard. The 2018 meeting marked the 123rd edition of this game (played continuously since 1919), five more than the Army‚ÄìNavy Game for the longest FBS series in the East, but now only equal to the \\"Deep South's Oldest Rivalry\\" (Georgia‚ÄìAuburn) which was recently played twice in the same year in 2017, for the longest FBS series in the South. The game was first twice played in 1892 (Virginia won the first, and North Carolina the second, splitting the southern title). Virginia then claims a southern championship for every year of 1893‚Äì1897, with North Carolina gaining a Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association title in 1895 (only loss to Virginia) and 1898. Both overshadowed by Sewanee in 1899, Virginia again went on a tear from 1900 until 1905 when North Carolina pulled the upset. Between 1889 and 1902, either Virginia (11) or North Carolina (2) claimed a southern championship every year except two (the aforementioned 1899 and 1891, claimed by Trinity). Among ACC rivalries, both programs of the South's Oldest Rivalry actually played against Trinity and Wake Forest years before playing against each other. North Carolina first played (and lost to) Trinity in 1888, after also losing against Wake Forest. Virginia first played and defeated Wake Forest in 1889, and first played and defeated Trinity in 1890. Trinity, in particular, played both Carolina and Virginia annually or close to it through 1894. However, Trinity abandoned the sport of football entirely between 1895 and 1919, as Wake did likewise from 1895 through 1907.\\"Trinity College To Have Football Season\\". Winstom-Salem Journal. July 25, 1920. Trinity renamed itself Duke University in 1924, two years after the Blue Devils became an annual rival of the Tar Heels. Wake Forest also was an annual rival of Carolina between 1908 and 2003 (after which, ACC realignment matched them more sporadically). In contrast, Virginia did not play Duke and Wake Forest regularly again until 1951 and 1955, respectively. The Virginia‚ÄìCarolina rivalry reached its modern crescendo during the 1990s when George Welsh and Mack Brown strolled the sidelines and turned both sides of the rivalry into top ACC programs with nationally ranked teams more years than not. In the 1990‚Äì1997 period that both sides were consistently near the top of the ACC standings, Welsh and the Cavaliers won five games to Brown and the Tar Heels' three. Welsh finished 7‚Äì3 overall against Brown including two wins in 1988 and 1989 while the Tar Heels were still deep in rebuilding mode (finishing 1‚Äì10 in Brown's first two years). After building up the program, Brown left Carolina for Texas after the 1997 season. Soon after his departure, both programs seemed to enter a slow decline and Welsh retired in 2000. In 2010, UNC broke a long losing streak in Charlottesville, UNC's first road win in the series since 1981. It ended what many UNC fans mockingly described as the \\"Charlottesville Curse\\" which lasted one year short of three decades. UVA led the overall series from 1893 to 1944, but UNC has since led from 1945 onward. Virginia closed to within two games in 2009 (or a tie if including the 1956 forfeit) but UNC then proceeded to win seven games in a row (2010‚Äì2016) as the Tar Heels went undefeated in the rivalry during the entire Virginia tenure of Mike London. Notwithstanding that extended losing streak, as of 2018 Virginia is 22‚Äì13‚Äì1 in the rivalry since 1983. The second-most played game for these teams, as of 2018, is fifteen fewer games (108 as of 2018) for North Carolina's in-state rivalry against NC State, and the second-most played series for Virginia is twenty-three fewer, 100 games as of 2018, for its own in-state rivalry against Virginia Tech (for the Commonwealth Cup).  Nature of the Rivalry  There is considerable historical lineage and academic standing between the two universities involved. The University of Virginia was founded by third President of the United States and founding father Thomas Jefferson, whereas the University of North Carolina was the first operational state university in the United States. William Faulkner was Writer-in- Residence at UVA, and Peter Taylor was on the UVA faculty and retired in Charlottesville. National Poet Laureate Rita Dove serves on the UVA faculty, and UVA is the alma mater of Edgar Allan Poe and eight winners of the Pulitzer Prize (including Edward P. Jones, Ron Suskind, Virginius Dabney, and five others). UNC is the alma mater of Thomas Wolfe (who wrote about the 1919 game in his posthumous novel The Web and the Rock), Walker Percy, and Shelby Foote. President Woodrow Wilson attended UVA and was President of its Jefferson Literary and Debating Society, whereas President James K. Polk attended UNC and was a Senator in its Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies. Assassinated Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was a graduate of UVA's law school. When the 1985 Richard Moll book was published listing the original eight \\"Public Ivies,\\" public colleges with rigorous academic standards, there were only two sharing a common athletic conference: the University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina. For at least nine consecutive years, U.S. News & World Report has ranked UVA second and UNC fifth among all public universities, and they are first and second in the east.Ranked above both is the University of California, Berkeley and UVA is tied with UCLA. UNC then trails only the University of Michigan for fourth nationwide. The two were also the first future members of the Atlantic Coast Conference to be elected to the prestigious Association of American Universities: UVA was elected in 1904 and UNC in 1922. Only Duke University would join them, in 1938, before the ACC was formed in 1953. They have since also been joined in the AAU by two newer ACC institutions: Georgia Tech (joined ACC in 1978; elected to AAU in 2010) and the University of Pittsburgh (elected to AAU in 1974; joined ACC in 2013). The rivalry is often called a \\"Gentlemen's Rivalry.\\" One reason for this moniker is the prestigious image, both academically and socially, of both universities throughout the region. The institutions' student bodies also tend to somewhat mirror one another from a social and academic standpoint. Contributing factors =Famous Spectators= President Calvin Coolidge attended the 1928 game held on Thanksgiving Day at Lambeth Field. Probably the most famous spectator of this rivalry was present on Thanksgiving Day in 1928. Sitting President of the United States Calvin Coolidge and First Lady Grace Anna Goodhue Coolidge were among the full capacity of 20,000 spectators to watch this rivalry game in Charlottesville. They were not graduates of either university (he had attended Amherst College and she the University of Vermont) but came purely out of interest. North Carolina won narrowly, 24‚Äì20, over Virginia in the eighth consecutive game in the series to be decided by a single touchdown or less. It was one of the last of these rivalry games played at Lambeth Field, as Scott Stadium was constructed in 1931 to accommodate more spectators.O'Neals (1968) Pictorial History of the University of Virginia. Charlottesville, Virginia: University Press of Virginia (p. 154) Coolidge had declined to run for a second term, and just sixteen days before the game Coolidge's Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, had won the 1928 presidential election to replace him. =\\"Benedict Ronald\\"= Often considered the best high school football player of all time from the state of Virginia, and the only junior ever to be named the nation's top high school quarterback by USA Today, Ronald Curry announced a verbal commitment to George Welsh's Virginia program on September 4, 1997 during ESPN coverage of that night's game between Virginia and Auburn.\\"Virginia Won Big Before It Took The Field\\"; Richmond Times ‚Äì Dispatch ‚Äì Richmond, Va.; Bob Lipper; Sep 5, 1997; Page D1 With the commitment from Curry, Welsh declined to recruit Michael Vick, whose own stellar career in the same high school district was largely overshadowed by Curry's. While Curry's high school football coach, 12-time state champion Mike Smith, was happy that Curry would attend Virginia, Curry's AAU basketball coach Boo Williams told Curry he should decommit and go to a \\"basketball school\\" like North Carolina to get a better shot at the NBA.Ronald Curry Has All the Moves; The Washington Post ‚Äì Washington, D.C.; Angie Watts; Apr 8, 1998; page C1 Curry decommitted from Virginia on signing day, causing him to be called \\"Benedict Ronald\\" and \\"Benedict Curry\\" by the Virginia faithful who blamed him not only for the program losing out on his own services, but for losing out on the unrecruited Vick. Curry was lampooned in the media, earning the title \\"Sports Jerk of the Year\\" in the nationally syndicated Tank McNamara comic strip. At North Carolina, Curry did not become the dominant college football player that many had expected him to be but still set UNC records including most career passing yards and most career total yards. He went 0‚Äì3 against UVA the next three seasons as a starting quarterback. The Tar Heels did finally beat Virginia when Curry was a senior and freshman Darian Durant started in his place. Curry played basketball for two seasons at UNC and started at point guard. He was drafted by the Oakland Raiders and played seven years in the NFL after converting to wide receiver. As of 2019, he is in his fourth year as the wide receivers coach for the New Orleans Saints. Game results :In 1956, North Carolina forfeited this game due to using an ineligible player. However, UNC and various other sources today count the game as a win. Other sports Virginia and North Carolina have won NCAA Championships in numerous sports other than football. In three particular men's sports they have established heated rivalries, and in each of these sports both sides have won one or more NCAA Championships. As of October 2019, a total of 28 national titles have been won between these two rivals in men's basketball, men's lacrosse, and men's soccer. Moreover, all six programs of the rivalries below have had great success not only historically but also recently: every program involved has won at least one NCAA Championship in the 2010s. =Men's basketball= Both Carolina and Virginia have NCAA Championship programs in men's basketball. Virginia's Tony Bennett holds a 10‚Äì7 edge against North Carolina's Roy Williams as of 2019. However, Carolina leads the overall series 131‚Äì57, accessed October 22, 2018; record updated December 8, 2019 as of the same date. Carolina has won six NCAA Championships (1957, 1982, 1993, 2005, 2009, 2017) while Virginia has won one NCAA Championship (2019), for a total of seven national titles between the two programs. Carolina defeated Virginia in the Championship Game of the 2016 ACC Tournament, and went on to win the 2017 NCAA Tournament the following year. Returning the favor, Virginia defeated Carolina in the Championship Game of the 2018 ACC Tournament, and went on to win the 2019 NCAA Tournament the following year. =Men's lacrosse= Both Virginia and Carolina have NCAA Championship programs in men's lacrosse.

It was selected in June 1997, first ran in May 1999, first flew in June 2000, and achieved certification on 15 December 2000. It entered service in July 2002 and 524 engines were delivered on-wing until the A340 production ended in 2011. Keeping the three spool architecture of the Trent family, it has the Trent 700's 2.47 m (97.5 in) fan and a Trent 800 core scaled down. It produces up to 275 kN (61,900 lbf) of thrust at take-off and has a bypass ratio up to 8.5:1 in cruise. Development In 1995, Airbus began considering an engine for two new long-range derivatives of its four-engined A340, the A340-500/600. The existing A340-200/300 was powered by CFM International CFM56 engines. However, the CFM56 was at the limit of its development capability, and would be unable to power the new A340-500/-600. In April 1996, Airbus signed an agreement with GE Aviation to develop a suitable engine, but decided not to proceed when GE demanded an exclusivity deal on the A340. Certification was applied for on 9 February 1998. The Trent 500 first ran in May 1999. By July 1999, Rolls-Royce had secured $5 billion worth of Trent 500 orders. Flight testing began in late June 2000 on a modified A340 testbed. By July 2000, the test program had amassed 1,750h and 2,00 cycles, and aimed for 15,000h and 4,000-5,000 cycles before introduction. It achieved certification on 15 December 2000. It entered service on the A340-600 with Virgin Atlantic in July 2002 and on the ultra- long range A340-500 with Emirates in December 2003. Air Canada had been expected to be the launch customer for the A340-500 in May 2003, but just before this on 1 April 2003 the airline filed for bankruptcy protection which resulted in delivery of its two A340-500s being delayed. This allowed Emirates to be the first airline to operate the type. After production of the Airbus A340 ended in 2011, a total of 131 A340-500/-600 have been delivered with 524 Trent 500 engines altogether; Lufthansa is the largest operator, with 24 delivered A340-600. Design The Trent 500 is a high bypass turbofan with three spools: the fan is powered by a 5 stage Low Pressure turbine (nominal speed: 3,900 RPM), the Intermediate pressure spool has an 8-stage axial compressor (9,100 RPM) and the High Pressure spool has an 6-stage axial compressor (13,300 RPM), both driven by a single turbine stage. It has an annular combustor and is equipped with an Electronic Engine Control System. It is flat rated at ISA + 15¬∞C for 248.1-275.3 kN (55,780-61,902 lbf) net thrust at take-off and has an 8.5:1 bypass ratio in cruise. The Trent 500 is essentially a scaled Trent 800, with a 2.47 m (97.5 in) fan with 26 unswept blades like the Trent 700.The IP and HP compressors and scaled down by 20% from the Trent 892, while the turbines are scaled down by 90% and are made of single crystal CMSX-4 alloy with thermal barrier coatings. Fuel burn is 1% lower because of throughout 3D aerodynamics. It was tested up to to establish limits. The Trent 500 powers the A340-500/600. It was certificated at thrust, but derated to as the Trent 553 to power the A340-500, and to as the Trent 556 for the A340-600 and A340-500HGW. However, a version is installed in the A340-600HGW (High Gross Weight), a higher-performance version of the A340-600. The Trent 500 has the same wide chord fan as the Trent 700, together with a core scaled from the Trent 800.

Rolls-Royce was studying a RB211 development for the A330 at its launch in June 1987. It was first selected by Cathay Pacific in April 1989, first ran in summer 1992, was certified in January 1994 and was put into service on 24 March 1995. Keeping the characteristic three-shaft architecture of the RB211, it is the first variant of the Trent family. With its fan for a 5:1 bypass ratio, it produces 300.3 to 316.3 kN (67,500-71,100 lbf) of thrust and reach an overall pressure ratio of 36:1. It competes with the GE CF6-80E1 and the PW4000 to power the A330. Development When Airbus launched its A330 twin- jet in June 1987, its only engine options included the CF6-80C2 and the PW4000. Rolls-Royce was studying whether to launch a RB211-700, development of the RB211 for the A330, the long-range B767 and MD-11, derived from the 747-400's -524D4D, with growth potential to . By June 1988, Rolls-Royce was investing over $540 million to develop the uprated RB-211-524L with a new fan up from for the -524G/H and a fourth LP turbine stage up from three, targeting . In April 1989, Cathay Pacific ordered ten A330s, powered by RB211-524L engines and with room to grow to , a first for Rolls-Royce on an Airbus aircraft. In June 1989, TWA confirmed an order for twenty A330s and selected the RB211-524L Trent engine for $620 million ( million each), rated for . By February 1992, design work was completed for the fan, Trent 700 and the first test was scheduled for July. By then, the earlier fan, Trent 600 for the MD-11 was abandoned due to lack of customers. By September, the first engine was running and was to be joined by five others by the end of the year. Certification was applied for on 30 June 1991 and was granted on 24 January 1994. The first Trent 700-powered A330 flew in August 1994. Cathay Pacific introduced it in March 1995. 90-minutes ETOPS approval was achieved in March 1995, and this was extended to 120 minutes in December 1995 and 180 minutes in May 1996. The Trent 700 was the third engine to market on the A330, after GE and PW.  Design  The Trent 700 is an axial flow, high bypass turbofan with three coaxial shafts. The fan has 26 Wide Chord Blades and is powered by a 4-stage low pressure turbine. The 8-stage IP compressor and 6-stage HP compressor are both driven by a single stage turbine. The single annular combustor has 24 Spray Nozzles. The engine is controlled by an EEC. Operational history By July 1999, the Trent had secured a near 40% share of engine orders for the A330. In 2009 Rolls-Royce introduced an upgraded version of the engine dubbed the Trent 700EP (enhanced performance) which incorporated a package of improvements derived from later members of the Trent engine family (especially the Trent 1000). These included elliptical leading edges and optimised fan and high-pressure turbine tip clearances. Together the improvements provided a 1.2% improvement to the Trent 700's specific fuel consumption. Some of the improvements were also made available as a retro-fit kit to existing airlines. Further upgrades were announced in 2013 as part of the T700EP2 package (EIS in late 2016). The upgraded engine will be available in 2015 and is intended for higher gross weight A330s. This upgrade package will improve fuel efficiency by about 1% and is likely to be the last upgrade of Trent 700. It may also be available as a retrofit package in the future. Rolls-Royce claims that the Trent 700 has the lowest life cycle fuel burn, and is the quietest and cleanest engine available on the A330. Cathay Pacific is the largest operator, with 31 Trent 700-powered A330s. Rolls received orders for 140 of the type during the Paris Air Show in June 2007. By July 2018, it has flown 50 million hours. Rolls-Royce claims a 60% market share. By June 2019, an Aeroflot Trent 700 which entered service in 2008 had completed over 50,000 hours without requiring an overhaul ‚Äì a record for a widebody engine.

Certification was applied for on 2 April 1992. By September 1992, its fan was to be tested in December and a full test was planned for September 1993. Certification was granted by the EASA on 27 January 1995. The first Boeing 777 with Trent 800 engines flew on 26 May 1995 and ETOPS approval was granted by the FAA on 10 October 1996. The Trent 800 entered service on the Boeing 777 in 1996, with Thai Airways on 31 March. In 1995, the Trent 800 won a large order from Singapore Airlines, a traditional Pratt & Whitney customer. In 1996, Rolls- Royce had a 32% market share, above GE but behind PW. By June 1998, the 33 aircraft fleet had a Trent 800 dispatch reliability over 99.96%. By July 1999, Rolls had won 45% of all engine orders for the 777. The Trent 800 later reached a 40% share of the engine market on the 777 variants for which it is available. The Singapore order was followed by large orders from American Airlines and Delta Air Lines. British Airways announced in September 1998 that it was returning to Rolls-Royce for its second batch of 777s, and did so again in April 2007. Other major operators include Air New Zealand or Kenya Airways. The last Trent 800-powered 777 was delivered in 2010. The later -300ER, -200LR, 777F, Boeing 777X-8 and -9 are powered exclusively by GE Aviation engines. As of 2014 Rolls-Royce is offering an upgraded version of the engine, known as the Trent 800EP. It incorporates technology from Trent 1000 and Trent XWB engines including elliptical leading edges on intermediate- and high- pressure compressor blades. Rolls-Royce claims that it provides a 0.7% fuel- burn benefit. Design The fan has 26 wide chord titanium fan blades. The Trent 800 is an axial flow, high bypass turbofan with three coaxial shafts. The fan is driven by a 5-stage axial LP turbine (3300 rpm), the 8-stage IP compressor (7000 rpm) and the 6-stage HP compressor (10611 rpm) are each powered by a single stage turbine.

The fan has 26 diffusion bonded, wide chord titanium fan blades. Rolls-Royce claims it is the lightest Boeing 777 engine, citing a weight saving over the GE90 and over the PW4000. The Trent 800 weighs 6.078 t (13,400 lb) dry, while the GE90 is , and the PW4000 is . Japanese KHI and Marubeni Corporation are risk and revenue sharing partners on the Trent 800. Operational history On 17 January 2008, a British Airways Boeing 777-236ER, operating as BA038 from Beijing to London, crash-landed at Heathrow after both Trent 800 engines lost power during the aircraft's final approach. The subsequent investigation found that ice released from the fuel system had accumulated on the fuel-oil heat exchanger, leading to a restriction of fuel flow to the engines. This resulted in Airworthiness Directives mandating the replacement of the heat exchanger. Rolls-Royce developed a modification to prevent the problem recurring that involved replacing a face plate that had many small protruding tubes with one that is flat.

The crater has been nearly filled with a relatively newer edifice, the Boquer√≥n volcano. San Salvador is adjacent to the volcano and the western section of the city actually lies among its slopes. Due to this close proximity, any geological activity of the volcano, whether eruptive or not, has the potential to result in catastrophic destruction and death to the city. Despite this, the volcano is iconic of the city, and several TV and radio antennas are situated on the El Picacho peaks and the crater of Boqueron. El Picacho, the prominent peak is the highest elevation (1,960 meters altitude).  Boquer√≥n edifice  San Salvador Metropolitan Area is pinned between San Salvador (volcano) and Lake Ilopango Caldera. The Pacific Coast is adjacent south of the city San Salvador volcano crater View of San Salvador City from San Salvador volcano's highest point The main edifice, known as the Boquer√≥n edifice, formed between 700 and 1,000 years ago, filling up a former caldera. The crescent-shaped ridge on the northeast side of the volcano is a remnant of the caldera rim. The lavas of the Boquer√≥n edifice contain more alkali elements and iron oxide than the lavas of the older edifice. Around 800 years ago, the present day crater was formed in a violent explosion. The crater, which gives it the present name (Boquer√≥n means \\"big mouth\\" in Spanish) is 1.5 km in diameter and 500m deep. Within the crater around the upper walls, crops are cultivated by the locals who live on the volcano. The magma chamber which the volcano sits upon contains a number of fissures which protrude along the flanks and sides of the volcano. The northwest (N40W) fissure has been the most active recently, with such significant eruptive events, such as the Loma Caldera eruption which buried the ancient village of Ceren and the eruption of El Playon (1658‚Äì71) which buried the town of Nexapa. The citizens relocated to Nejapa and nowadays the eruption is celebrated annually. The most recent eruption in 1917 caused a flank eruption on the volcano along the N40W fissure. During this eruption, the crater lake inside the Boquer√≥n evaporated and a cinder cone appeared, christened 'Boquer√≥ncito'.

Bensen. Nominated for the 1979 John W. Campbell Award, it tells the story of aliens who crash-land on Earth in 1908 and then journey around the planet, trying to jump-start World War I. Even though they fail to do this, they succeed in creating the circumstances for their ultimate departure from Earth after a period of suspended animation. Plot summary According to the novel, the Siberian explosion was originally caused by the crash landing of the spaceship named The Wanderer. In this alternate reality, however, the alien astronauts are able to commandeer their failing vessel so that it lands in the Pacific Ocean, just outside San Francisco. Shortly after landing, the quartet of spacemen are rescued from the sea by an American ship and taken to California. The Wanderer sinks into the ocean, and the team reasons that they must find a way to accelerate Earth's technological advances so that they can get back home. The eventual conclusion at which they arrive is that they must provoke the planet into what Ari claims is an inevitable global conflict, one that will (through weaponry innovations) result in a boom of new science and industry. Characters =The astronauts and their roles= The four astronauts never identify their home world, merely saying that they are a team of Explorers sent to gather information about foreign planets. *Raf: The main character of the book, Raf tells the story in first person. He is a Recorder, and is responsible for ensuring that every detail of the expedition is written down. Raf is quite detached in his observations and seems to be fairly optimistic. While on Earth, he develops a strong taste for alcoholic beverages. *Ari: Ari is a Metahistorian, which seems to signify a study of universal historical trends among people of different galaxies and solar systems. His has a tendency to be very long-winded and often clashes with Dark. *Valmis: Valmis is an Integrator. This is a rather obscure occupation that somehow involves interpreting the \\"Patterns\\" of the universe, of civilizations, of individual people, of anything and everything. Valmis is very mystical and often frustrates his crew-mates, particularly Dark. *Dark: Dark is the Captain of The Wanderer and as such is an expert in all things mechanical. He is practical to a fault and is ceaselessly annoyed by what he sees as the meaningless ramblings of Valmis and Ari. =Historical characters= The astronauts interact with a number of important global personages during their stay on Earth. *Theodore Roosevelt: In the book, Theodore Roosevelt becomes the 26th President of the United States in 1901 after William McKinley is assassinated. He is elected to a full term in 1904. He is elected as the 28th President in 1912 and reelected in 1916 and serves until 1921. Roosevelt was the first major world leader with whom the spacemen acquaint themselves, and acts as a benevolent and friendly presence. In the book, he is quoted as saying that if he could only take back his promise not to run for reelection in 1908, he would cut off his right hand. ‚ÄúIf I hadn‚Äôt promised not to run again...by George, I‚Äôd cut my hand off to here!‚Äù Roosevelt helps the aliens to escape house arrest in New York in 1909. In 1925, while he is attending a demonstration of an experimental moon rocket, Roosevelt is killed when the device's engines explode and destroy the platform he was on. *J.P. Morgan: Mr. Morgan, the industrial titan of the Gilded Age, makes a brief appearance at the very beginning of the book, in 1908. He is concerned that the revelation that aliens exist will turn the U.S. financial markets asunder, and he works with President Roosevelt through the U.S. Treasury Department to ensure that the economy is unshaken by the news. *William Howard Taft: Secretary of War William Howard Taft, who in reality served as the 27th President from 1909 to 1913 and then became a Supreme Court Justice, appears very briefly at the beginning of the book. His one and only cameo comes in 1908, when he and Theodore Roosevelt are discussing the effects that the presence of extraterrestrials could have on the election. He is asked by the Republican National Committee to relinquish their nomination for President, news that overjoys President Roosevelt, who assumes that he will be the new nominee. It is Taft who delivers the startling news that the Committee plans to nominate Thomas Alva Edison. *Thomas Alva Edison: In the book, Thomas Edison also arrives at the White House in 1908, chiefly to interview the aliens and learn about their technology, which fascinates him. The aliens are able to create an effective hearing aid for Edison to help him with his poor hearing. When word of the spacemen goes public, the Republican Party bounces William Howard Taft as their 1908 nominee, reasoning that only a man as brilliant as Edison would be able to steer America through such incredible new times. In 1909, Edison has the aliens placed under house arrest in New York so that he can pry technological secrets from them. They escape (thanks to former president Roosevelt), however, and head to Europe, and Edison is obliged to dispatch Marines to go after them. When he finally has them in his clutches again, President Edison realizes that the amount of technology the aliens possess would, if widely distributed, cause widespread upheaval. \\"Nearly free power for everyone, available tomorrow, ain‚Äôt that grand? No need to buy coal, gasoline, oil, wood, anything like that. And no need to pay the coal miners, oil people, filling stations, anybody like that. I calculate it‚Äôd take about six weeks for the country to turn into a howling wilderness of starving mobs...We‚Äôre an industrious and inventive people, and I don‚Äôt see any easy gifts you could let us have be worth losing that.\\" In 1912, Edison decides not to run for reelection, and rather goes back to inventing. *H. G. Wells: The famous science fiction writer acts as an escort for the extraterrestrials, summoned to learn about their culture and distribute the news of their coming. He becomes one of their closest companions. *George M. Cohan: The aliens befriend the famous songwriter and performer during their stay in New York. *King Edward VII: King of the United Kingdom since 1901. After escaping the United States, the aliens head to France in 1909, where they are to have an audience with King Edward VII regarding the inevitability of a coming world war. Raf, in wondering why the King of England should be in France, notes, \\"The King, it appeared, made a habit of leaving his country for substantial periods of time, especially during the uncertain weather of late winter and early spring, which he spent in France, but also in summer and autumn. His subjects, far from resenting this, were gratified, as most of them would themselves have preferred to be elsewhere much of the time, and so took a prideful vicarious pleasure in their monarch‚Äôs travels.\\" In meeting with Edward, the Explorers demonstrate their stunning lack of tact, having not yet become accustomed to human social norms. When he hears of the widespread destruction and misery that World War I will bring, Edward is upset. \\"'If it must be, so it must. God grant I do not live to see it.' \\"'That‚Äôs about an even chance,' Ari said, looking at him appraisingly. 'If you were to get at it pretty quickly...you‚Äôd probably see it pretty well launched. If you and your fellow kings just let things drag on another couple of years or so, why, I‚Äôd have to agree you‚Äôd probably be pretty well out of it.'\\" Edward nearly dies right in front of the Explorers, and they are obliged to revive him using their highly advanced medical technology, thus restoring him to full health as he has not enjoyed since young manhood. Out of gratitude, Edward shields them from the U.S. Marines seeking to arrest them and sees to it that they make it safely to Berlin. *Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany: Emperor of Germany. After leaving France, the Explorers head to the Imperial Palace in Berlin, where they are received by Wilhelm II. When the team tries to tell him about the coming World War, he is incredulous, insisting that such a conflict is impossible due to the sheer military might of his empire. He, like his uncle Edward VII, is humbled by the alien visitors‚Äô complete and uninhibited honesty. After Wilhelm states that Germans believe a healthy body houses a healthy mind, Dark questions, \\"'Look here. That healthy body business‚Äîhow does that square with that arm of yours?'\\" The Kaiser's left arm had been pulled from its socket at birth as a result of his Breech birth that caused Erb's palsy, the topic was an extremely sensitive one for him. As a child, he was forced by cruel tutors to learn to ride horseback without any assistance whatsoever. They would watch callously as the young crown prince fell from his steed, never once making a move to come to his aid. Wilhelm consequently developed an extremely bellicose personality, one that, in the real world, contributed to the outbreak of World War I. When the Kaiser hears Dark's remark regarding his arm, he is so furious that he attempts to attack the alien with his ceremonial sword. This merely results in Wilhelm falling to the ground and being unable to get up. Dark, completely oblivious to the fact that he is responsible for the episode, extends his arm towards the emperor, saying compassionately, \\"'Here, let me give you a hand, as you've only got one that's of any use to you.'\\" The Kaiser forgives Dark's insolence, however, when the spaceman repairs his shriveled limb so that it is in good working order. When the Explorers leave Berlin, their human companions are shocked to see Kaiser Wilhelm waving at them with two healthy arms. The Kaiser gets the troupe on a train to St. Petersburg first thing, so that they might conference with his cousin, Czar Nicholas II. *Czar Nicholas II of Russia: When the Explorers first meet Czar Nicholas at Tsarskoe Selo, the Imperial palace outside of St. Petersburg, he is timid and unwilling to accept the reality of what they are telling him. He protests that he already has enough trouble on his hands without this new burden, and that \\"it's all too much for me.\\" When the Czar's son, five-year-old Czarevitch Alexei, walks right into the room, Nicholas softly objects, \\"Alexei, you know you're not supposed to come in here while Papa is doing business.\\" Nicholas is just about to dismiss his visitors when Alexei falls and strikes his head on the desk. Nicholas immediately leaps up, cradling his son and screaming frantically for \\"Grigori!\\" The Czar tearfully lays his son on the couch until the filthy monk Grigori Rasputin enters the room, chants over the suffering child, and leaves. Alexei is calm after this, and is taken back to the children's quarters. The Czar is deeply shaken by the incident, and begins to discuss the czarevitch's illness with the Explorers. Valmis, usually withdrawn and ethereal, says that the only thing afflicting the boy is a bad set of Patterns. Valmis analyses some of Alexei's blood and finds that a certain protein is missing. He then views the Czar's blood, finds the necessary protein, and is able to reproduce it using machinery of Dark's. A sample of this new blood is injected into the czarevitch, who is completely cured within three days. There is nationwide rejoicing at this news in Russia, and, the very day of Alexei's recovery, Rasputin is dragged from the Palace by Imperial soldiers. Czar Nicholas is so boundlessly thankful that he arranges safe passage to Spain for the Explorers, who are still being pursued by Marines. In addition, the Czar promises to seriously consider everything that Ari has told him about the possibility of a World War. *Grigori Rasputin: With the Czarevitch cured, Rasputin has no further use at the Imperial court and was thrown out of the palace by Imperial soldiers. He eventually makes his way to New York and becomes successful in the advertising and film industries. *Czarevitch Alexei Nicholaevitch Romanov: In the book, young Czarevitch Alexei of Russia is cured of his Haemophilia by the visiting aliens in 1908. During their 1933 tour of Earth, which they undertake just prior to their departure from the planet, the Explorers are received by Alexei, who is now the Czar of Russia. During the encounter, Raf describes him as a \\"strapping young lad.\\" In reality, of course, Czarevitch Alexei was murdered, along with the rest of his family, by Bolshevik revolutionaries in 1918, when he was only thirteen years old.

Background In 1919, the requisite number of state legislatures ratified the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, enabling national prohibition one year later. Many women, notably members of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, were pivotal in bringing about national Prohibition in the United States, believing it would protect families, women, and children from the effects of alcohol abuse. Around 1820, \\"the typical adult white American male consumed nearly a half pint of whiskey a day\\". Historian W. J. Rorabaugh, writing on the factors that brought about the start of the temperance movement, and later, Prohibition in the United States, states: The proponents of National Prohibition believed that banning alcoholic beverages would reduce or even eliminate many social problems, particularly drunkenness, domestic violence, crime, mental illness, and secondary poverty. Impact of prohibition Scholarly literature regarding the effect of prohibition is mixed, with some writers insisting that that popular claim that prohibition was a failure is false. Prohibition was successful in reducing the amount of liquor consumed, cirrhosis death rates, admissions to state mental hospitals for alcoholic psychosis, arrests for public drunkenness, and rates of absenteeism. temperance fountain erected by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union during the Prohibition era in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware Mark H. Moore, a professor at Harvard University Kennedy School of Government, stated, with respect to the effects of prohibition: Specifically, \\"rates for cirrhosis of the liver fell by 50 percent early in Prohibition and recovered promptly after Repeal in 1933.\\" Moore also found that contrary to popular opinion, \\"violent crime did not increase dramatically during Prohibition\\" and that organized crime \\"existed before and after\\" Prohibition. The historian Jack S. Blocker Jr. stated that \\"Death rates from cirrhosis and alcoholism, alcoholic psychosis hospital admissions, and drunkenness arrests all declined steeply during the latter years of the 1910s, when both the cultural and the legal climate were increasingly inhospitable to drink, and in the early years after National Prohibition went into effect.\\" In addition, \\"once Prohibition became the law of the land, many citizens decided to obey it\\". During the Prohibition era, rates of absenteeism decreased from 10% to 3%. In Michigan, the Ford Motor Company documented \\"a decrease in absenteeism from 2,620 in April 1918 to 1,628 in May 1918.\\" Journalist H. L. Mencken, writing in 1925, believed the opposite to be true: Some supporters of Prohibition, such as Charles Stelzle who wrote Why Prohibition! (1918), believed that prohibition would eventually lead to reductions in taxes, since drinking \\"produced half the business\\" for institutions supported by tax dollars such as courts, jails, hospitals, almshouses, and insane asylums. In fact, alcohol consumption and the incidence of alcohol-related domestic violence were decreasing before the Eighteenth Amendment was adopted. Following the imposition of Prohibition, reformers \\"were dismayed to find that child neglect and violence against children actually increased during the Prohibition era.\\" Kenneth D. Rose, a professor of history at California State University, says that 'the WONPR claimed that prohibition had nurtured a criminal class, created a \\"crime wave,\\" corrupted public officials, made drinking fashionable, engendered a contempt for rule of law, and set back the progress of \\"true temperance.\\"' Rose, however, states that a \\"prohibition crime wave was rooted in the impressionistic rather than the factual.\\" He writes: Prohibitionists argued that Prohibition would be more effective if enforcement were increased. However, David E. Kyvig claims that increased efforts to enforce Prohibition simply resulted in the government spending more money, rather than less. The economic cost of Prohibition became especially pronounced during the Great Depression. According to two organizations advocating against Prohibition, Association Against the Prohibition Amendment (AAPA) and Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform (WONPR), an estimated $861 million was lost in federal tax revenue from untaxed liquor; $40 million was spent annually on Prohibition enforcement. The AAPA also released a pamphlet claiming that $11 billion was lost in federal liquor-tax revenue and $310 million was spent on Prohibition enforcement from 1920 to 1931.Kyvig, Repealing National Prohibition, p. 132. This lack of potential funding during a period of economic strife became a crucial part of the campaign for repeal.Mark Thorton and Chetley Weise believe that tax revolts were a key component in the repeal movement. See Organized opposition Judge, 2 Sep 1922) During this period, support for Prohibition diminished among voters and politicians. John D. Rockefeller Jr., a lifelong nondrinker who had contributed between $350,000 and $700,000 to the Anti-Saloon League, announced his support for repeal because of the widespread problems he believed Prohibition had caused. Influential leaders, such as the du Pont brothers, led the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment, whose name clearly asserted its intentions. The repeal movement also attracted a substantial portion of women, defying the assumption that recently enfranchised female voters would automatically vote as a bloc on this issue.Kyvig, Repealing National Prohibition, p. 118. They became pivotal in the effort to repeal, as many \\"had come to the painful conclusion that the destructiveness of alcohol was now embodied in Prohibition itself.\\" By then, women had become even more politically powerful due to ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in support of women's suffrage.U.S. Const. amend. XIX See Activist Pauline Sabin argued that repeal would protect families from the corruption, violent crime, and underground drinking that resulted from Prohibition. On May 28, 1929, Sabin founded the Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform (WONPR), which attracted many former Prohibitionists to its ranks. By the time repeal was finally passed in 1933 the WONPR's membership was estimated at 1.5 million. Originally, Sabin was among the many women who supported the Eighteenth Amendment. Now, however, she viewed Prohibition as both hypocritical and dangerous. She recognized \\"the apparent decline of temperate drinking\\" and feared the rise of organized crime that developed around bootlegging.Kyvig, \\"Women against Prohibition,\\" p. 468. Additionally, Sabin worried that America's children, witnessing a blatant disregard for dry laws, would cease to recognize the sanctity of the law itself. Finally, Sabin and the WONPR took a libertarian stance that disapproved of federal involvement in a personal matter like drinking. Over time, however, the WONPR modified its argument, playing up the \\"moral wrongs that threatened the American home\\" as a result of the corruption of the Prohibition era. As a women's organization during the early 20th century, adopting a political stance that centered around maternalism and home protection appealed to the widest audience and was favored over personal liberty arguments, which ultimately received little attention. The WONPR was initially composed mainly of upper-class women. However, by the time the Twenty-first Amendment was passed, their membership included the middle and working classes. After a short start-up period, donations from members alone were enough to financially sustain the organization. By 1931, more women belonged to the WONPR than the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU); by 1932, the WONPR had branches in forty-one states.Kyvig, \\"Women against Prohibition,\\" p. 474. The WONPR supported repeal on a platform of \\"true\\" temperance, claiming that \\"a trend toward moderation and restraint in the use of intoxicating beverages [was] reversed by prohibition.\\"Kyvig, \\"Women against Prohibition,\\" p. 472. Though their causes were in direct opposition, the WONPR mirrored the advocacy techniques of the WCTU. They canvassed door-to-door, encouraged politicians on all levels to incorporate repeal into their party platform, created petitions, gave speeches and radio interviews, dispersed persuasive literature, and held chapter meetings. At times, the WONPR also worked in cooperation with other anti-prohibition groups. In 1932 the AAPA, Voluntary Committee of Lawyers, The Crusaders, the American Hotel Organization, and the WONPR formed the United Repeal Council. The United Repeal Council lobbied at both the Republican and Democratic national conventions in 1932 to integrate repeal into their respective presidential election campaigns. Ultimately, the Republicans continued to defend Prohibition. The WONPR, which initially began as a nonpartisan organization, joined with the Democratic campaign and supported Franklin Roosevelt.Kyvig, Repealing National Prohibition, p. 156-57. The number of repeal organizations and demand for repeal both increased. =Organizations supporting repeal= *Association Against the Prohibition Amendment *Constitutional Liberty League of Massachusetts, a nationwide organization despite its name *The Crusaders *Labor's National Committee for Modification of the Volstead Act *Moderation League of New York, a nationwide organization despite its name *Molly Pitcher Club *Republican Citizens Committee Against National Prohibition *United Repeal Council *Voluntary Committee of Lawyers *Women's Committee for Repeal of the 18th Amendment *Women's Moderation Union * Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform Organization leaders *Nicholas Murray Butler *Joseph H.

Roosevelt ran for president of the United States promising repeal of federal Prohibition laws. A. Mitchell Palmer used his expertise as the Attorney General who first enforced Prohibition to promote a plan to expedite its repeal through state conventions rather than the state legislatures. Repeal 1933 newsreel The Cullen‚ÄìHarrison Act, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 22, 1933, authorized the sale of 3.2 percent beer (thought to be too low an alcohol concentration to be intoxicating) and wine, which allowed the first legal beer sales since the beginning of Prohibition on January 16, 1920. In 1933 state conventions ratified the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed Prohibition. The Amendment was fully ratified on December 5, 1933. Federal laws enforcing Prohibition were then repealed. = Dry counties = Following repeal some states continued prohibition within their own jurisdictions. Almost two-thirds of the states adopted some form of local option which enabled residents in political subdivisions to vote for or against local prohibition. For a time, 38 percent of Americans lived in areas with Prohibition. By 1966, however, all states had repealed their statewide prohibition laws, with Mississippi the last state to do so.

The span, opened in 1888, connects 181st Street and Amsterdam Avenue in Washington Heights, Manhattan, with University Avenue in Morris Heights, Bronx. It carries six lanes of traffic, as well as sidewalks on both sides. Ramps at either end of the bridge connect to the Trans-Manhattan Expressway and the Cross-Bronx Expressway. The bridge is operated and maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation. It once carried U.S. Route 1, which now travels over the Alexander Hamilton Bridge. Description The total length of the bridge, including approaches, is . The parallel main spans of the steel arch bridge stretch over the Harlem River, providing of vertical clearance and of horizontal clearance. The tidal maximum (mean higher high water) is and extreme low water is -3.5 compared to mean lower low water. History Ernest Lawson's painting Spring Night (1913) This two-hinged arch bridge was designed by Charles C. Schneider and Wilhelm Hildenbrand, with modifications to the design made by the Union Bridge Company, William J. McAlpine, Theodore Cooper and DeLemos & Cordes, with Edward H. Kendall as consulting architect. The original design was pared down to bring the bridge's cost to $3 million. The bridge features steel-arch construction with two 510-foot-long (150m) main spans and masonry approaches. Construction began in 1886, and the bridge opened to pedestrian traffic on December 1, 1888. The plan had been to open the bridge to vehicular traffic on February 22, 1889 ‚Äî Washington's Birthday and the centennial anniversary of the first Presidency ‚Äî but the full opening was delayed until December 1889. In 1913, a young architect named John Bruns is reported to have jumped from the Washington bridge and lived. He was quoted at his trial: \\"Why, Your Honor, it was a nerve test. Some friends had been taunting me on my lack of nerve because I had never married, and as we talked over the matter I made a bet that I would dive from the bridge.\\" After completion of the George Washington Bridge in 1931, traffic off the bridge into the Bronx traveled over the Washington Bridge. Starting in the 1940s, ramps were built to connect the western end of the bridge to the 178th Street and 179th Street Tunnels leading to the George Washington Bridge. This allowed traffic to and from New Jersey to bypass the congested local streets of Upper Manhattan. The Alexander Hamilton Bridge was planned in the mid-1950s to provide a direct connection between Robert Moses's proposed Trans-Manhattan and Cross-Bronx Expressways and to accommodate the additional traffic resulting from the addition of the six-lane lower level to the George Washington Bridge. The completion of the Alexander Hamilton Bridge in 1963 diverted much of the traffic away from the Washington Bridge. The Washington Bridge underwent reconstruction from 1989 to 1993.

Early life and education Mills was born in Montreal, Quebec. He was raised in Verdun, Quebec and started playing piano at the age of three. His family was musical and his mother also played piano and his father sang tenor. By the time he was 17 both parents died of cancer. Mills attended McGill University for five years. At McGill, he initially studied engineering, but eventually switched to the Department of Music. He entertained his Delta Upsilon fraternity brothers with songs from ragtime to Bob Dylan (a new musician at the time). The fraternity piano had thumbtacks on every hammer and produced a unique sound. Career In the late 1960s, Mills became a member of The Bells. He left the band in 1971 just before it had international success with the single \\"Stay Awhile.\\" Mills worked as a pianist for CBC Television and recorded his first solo album, Seven Of My Songs, which produced the hit single \\"Love Me, Love Me Love\\". The song made its debut on the Canadian charts in October 1971 and early the following year peaked at #1 on the Canadian charts, number 46 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 8 on Billboard‚Ä≤s Easy Listening chart His 1972 cover of Ricky Nelson's \\"Poor Little Fool\\" made top 25 on the Canadian charts, but only reached number 106 in the US. Mills released an album in 1974 that featured \\"Music Box Dancer\\", but it was not a hit initially. When he re-signed with Polydor Records Canada in 1978, the label released a new song as a single, with \\"Music Box Dancer\\" on the B-side. The single was sent to easy listening radio stations in Canada, but a copy was sent in error to CFRA-AM, a pop station in Ottawa. The program director played the A-side and could not figure out why it had been sent to his station, so he played the B-side to see if the record was mistakenly marked. He liked \\"Music Box Dancer\\" and added it to his station's playlist, turning the record into a Canadian hit. Dave \\"50,000\\" Watts, an Ottawa Valley radio personality, gave the record extensive airplay on the station.American Top 40 with Casey Kasem, March 10, 1979. The album went gold in Canada, which prompted Polydor in the US to release the album and single. In Nashville, news producer Bob Parker at WNGE-TV began playing the song over the closing credits of the newscast. Nashville DJs quickly gave the song airplay, and both the single and album were hits. The million-selling (Gold-certified) single reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1979 as well as number 4 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart, while the album reached number 21 on the Billboard Top Album chart and also went gold. Polydor awarded a gold record to TV station WNGE for breaking the single in the US. \\"Music Box Dancer\\" was Mills' only US Top 40 pop hit. The follow-up, another piano instrumental, \\"Peter Piper\\", peaked at number 48 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became a Top 10 hit on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Mills managed one final Adult Contemporary chart entry, \\"Happy Song\\", which peaked at number 41 at the beginning of 1981. Mills won two Juno Awards in 1980 for \\"Peter Piper\\", one for Composer of the Year and one for Instrumental Artist of the Year. He again won in the latter category in 1981. He continued to release albums until the early 1990s. In 2010 he traveled on a Christmas tour with Canadian singer Rita MacNeil. Mills and MacNeil toured again in November‚ÄìDecember 2012. Film and television appearances \\"Music Box Dancer\\" was the theme song of the local Los Angeles CBS half-hour TV documentary show 2 on the Town from 1979 through the early 1980s. \\"Music Box Dancer\\" has been heard on an episode of The Simpsons and in the Kill Bill movies. It was used as the theme tune to the BBC2 golf programme, Around with Alliss, and also as a popular track on the BBC1 trade test (testcard) transmissions. Other Frank Mills tracks including 'Sidewalk cafe' were used on BBC1 and BBC2 in the 1970s and 1980s during testcard, ceefax and intervals between programmes.

(1782-1876). The organization's original mission is focused on caring for the needs of their society through education and nursing care. History =Origins= The founder, born Jeanne Haze in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge, was forced into exile with her family in Germany when French Revolutionary Army forces occupied her principality. Her father died during that period, leaving the family in poverty. Her family returned to Li√®ge. After their return, because of their own experiences, Haze and her sister Ferdinande felt drawn to help people in most need. When their mother died in 1820, the sisters wanted to enter a religious community, but were not able to do so due to the restrictions of Church law at the time. In an answer to a request by their pastor, Canon Cloes, the Dean of St Bartholomew Collegiate Church, the sisters opened a school for poor children in the parish in 1829 in the home of the curate of the parish, Canon Jean- Guillaume Habets. The creation of an independent Kingdom of Belgium the following year allowed them to establish the school officially as a Catholic institution. The emblem of the Daughters of the Cross of Li√®ge Soon other young women joined the pair in their desire to follow the consecrated life. Habets, originally skeptical of their desire, came to support them. He helped the group to write their Constitutions. On September 8, 1833, the Haze sisters professed perpetual religious vows, receiving the names Mother Marie Th√©r√®se and Mother Aloysia in the Carmelite Church of Potay, next to their own convent. Two other companions, Sisters Clara and Constance, made their temporary vows for one year and two postulants began their novitiate. Thus the Congregation of the Daughters of the Cross was established under a Rule of life based on Ignatian spirituality. The Daughters of the Cross took over the administration of a women's prison in 1841 and a house for the rehabilitation of prostitutes the following year. In 1843 they opened a shelter for the homeless, which housed 125 residents. The congregation was formally approved by Pope Gregory XVI on October 1, 1845, thereby raised to the status of a congregation of pontifical right. By that time the congregation had grown to 84 Sisters who operated 4 schools, with a total enrollment of about 1,000 girls. Of those girls, 80% were given a free education. Their Constitutions were approved by Pope Pius IX in 1851. =Expansion= The Sisters began to serve in other countries with their establishing a foundation in Germany in 1849. At the invitation of the Vicar Apostolic of Bombay, they opened schools in the British Raj in 1861. This led to their working in the United Kingdom in 1863. United States  In 1855, Auguste Martin, the Bishop of the Diocese of Natchitoches, Louisiana, held conversations with Mother Mary Hyacinth (1816 - 1897) of the Daughters of the Cross to ask for missionary workers in Louisiana. Her Order was interested in teaching in America. Permission was granted by the Bishop of France for ten nuns to undertake this task. On Oct. 19, 1855, the Daughters of the Cross arrived in Avoyelles Parish. In 1860, Rev. John Pierre invited them to Shreveport to found a school next door to Holy Trinity Catholic Church (Shreveport, Louisiana), which remained open until 1954. By 1870, the Order had opened six schools in North Louisiana. In totality, 21 schools in the state were established by the Order over the years, including St John Berchmans Catholic School in Shreveport in 1949. After the Civil War‚Äôs end in 1866, Pierre advised the Order about a parcel of land south of Shreveport that would be an excellent location for a girl‚Äôs boarding school. Mother Hyacinth then purchased 100 acres and a building. St. Vincent‚Äôs Academy opened in October, 1868, as a day and boarding school solely for girls. It was accredited to confer high school diplomas and college degrees, as well as to teach first through 12th grades. The school's enrollment continued to rise until a devastating Yellow fever epidemic in 1873. Subsequent growth was mostly due to the efforts of Rev. Napoleon Joseph Roulleaux, who was chaplain of the convent and school. In 1906, a fire destroyed the school but the buildings were rebuilt with a gothic design from clay bricks on the same property. In September, 1962, the academy was transferred to a new site on Fairfield Avenue, where it remained until its closure due to economic struggles at the end of the 1987-88 session, culminating in 119 years of devoted service by the Daughters of the Cross. St. Vincent‚Äôs Academy declined to consider a merger at the time with Loyola College Prep, which was a local all-male Catholic high school founded by the Jesuits in 1902. Only a very small number of nuns from the Order remain in the Northern Louisiana community. They are retired and are no longer involved in the operations of any of the numerous remaining schools the Order founded in the region. The Order of the Daughters of the Cross, overall, now has a limited active presence in the United States, primarily restricted to ministries of caring for seniors, the sick, dying, and the homebound in Tracy, California, which are organized and conducted under the auspices of the United Kingdom province. In 1958, four nuns from the Daughters of the Cross of England had come to Tracy to open St. Bernard's School. Over the years their ministry expanded to Angel's Camp, Lockford, Manteca, San Andreas, and Stockton. Today, the sisters work in Manteca, Stockton, and Tracy. United Kingdom Haze sent her Sisters to England in 1863. In the United Kingdom, the Daughters of the Cross are constituted as a registered charity. In 2006‚Äì7 it had a gross income of ¬£56,197,000, making it one of the 100 largest charities in the United Kingdom. =Schools= * St Philomena's Catholic High School for Girls, Carshalton, Surrey =Charities= * St Anthony's Hospital, Cheam, Surrey, England * St Raphael's Hospice, Cheam, Surrey, England * St Elizabeth's Centre, Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, England.

After the farewell, 2308, as well as seven AEM-7's, were leased to NJ Transit to help alleviate a locomotive shortage due to positive train control installation on their locomotives. However, they were never used for New Jersey Transit and they have since returned to SEPTA in May of 2019. The AEM-7s and the ALP-44 are now used exclusively in SEPTA work service. Specifications The ALP-44 was based on the Rc6 model and designed specifically for New Jersey Transit as a variant of the EMD AEM-7 electric locomotive, used by Amtrak (before June 2016), MARC (before April 2017), and SEPTA (before December 2018). ALP-44 stands for American Locomotive Passenger 4-Axle 4.32 MW. The ALP-44 is powered by overhead lines through one of the locomotive's two pantographs and can produce up to 7000 hp (5.2 MW) with a top speeds of up to 125 mph (201 km/h). In commercial use however, both New Jersey Transit and SEPTA ALP-44s are cleared for speeds up to 100 mph (161 km/h). =ALP-44M= The ALP-44M is a variant of the original ALP-44 design. It included a microprocessor control for functions such as braking and the then new EPIC brake control stand. These locomotives were notorious for their faulty software, which frequently caused problems and kept them out of service for maintenance.

Considered a master tailor alongside those such as Madeleine Vionnet, he is known for his avant-garde tailoring featuring Japanese design aesthetics. Yamamoto has won notable awards for his contributions to fashion, including the Chevalier/Officier/Commandeur of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon, the Ordre national du M√©rite, the Royal Designer for Industry and the Master of Design award by Fashion Group International. Early life Born in Tokyo, Yamamoto graduated from Keio University with a degree in law in 1966. He gave up a prospective legal career to assist his mother in her dressmaking business, from where he learned his tailoring skills. He further studied fashion design at Bunka Fashion College, getting a degree in 1969. \\"Yoji Yamamoto,\\" Women's Wear Daily (New York).

The New York Times. 23 October 1983. More recently he has expounded: \\"When I started making clothes for my line Y‚Äôs in 1977, all I wanted was for women to wear men‚Äôs clothes. I jumped on the idea of designing coats for women. It meant something to me ‚Äì the idea of a coat guarding and hiding a woman‚Äôs body. I wanted to protect the woman‚Äôs body from something ‚Äì maybe from men‚Äôs eyes or a cold wind.\\" His commercially successful main line, Yohji Yamamoto (women/men) and Y's, are especially popular in Tokyo. These two lines are also available at his flagship stores in Paris and Antwerp, and at high-end department stores worldwide. Other principal lines include Pour Homme, Costume d'Homme, and the diffusion line Coming Soon. Yohji Yamamoto Inc. reported in 2007 that the sales of Yamamoto's two main lines average above $100 million annually. Yamamoto is known for an avant-garde spirit in his clothing, frequently creating designs far removed from current trends. His signature oversized silhouettes often feature drapery in varying textures. Yohji' collections are predominately made in black, a colour which Yamamoto has described as ‚Äúmodest and arrogant at the same time. Black is lazy and easy - but mysterious. But above all black says this: \\"I don‚Äôt bother you - don‚Äôt bother me\\". Yamamoto's work has also become familiar to consumers through his collaborations with other fashion brands, including Adidas (Y-3), Herm√®s, Mikimoto, Mandarina Duck and New Era Cap Company; and with artists of different genres, such as Tina Turner, Sir Elton John, Placebo, Takeshi Kitano, Daniel Barenboim, Pina Bausch and Heiner M√ºller. Yohji Yamamoto was invited to curate the second issue of A MAGAZINE curated by in 2005, following Martin Margiela. Poor decisions by finance managers pushed the brand into debts of more than 65 million US dollars in 2009, which angered Yamamoto and led to a company restructuring from 2009 to 2010. The private equity firm Integral Corp was identified as the Japanese company who will restructure the Yohji Yamamoto Inc and by November 2010 the company was out of debt and avoiding the risk of bankruptcy. Yohji has expressed a deep love for designing clothing, going so far as to say he 'cannot imagine [himself] retired'. Fashion advocacy In 2008, the Yohji Yamamoto Fund for Peace was established to foster development of China's fashion industry and to help heal the long-standing enmity between China and Japan.Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries: \\"Y‚Äôs Fashion Show and Auction for Yohji Yamamoto Fund for Peace Held in Beijing.\\" Each year, an emerging Chinese designer will be awarded with a two-year scholarship to a fashion college in Japan or Europe, and a male or female Chinese fashion model will be selected to make a runway debut during the Paris pr√™t-√†-porter season.Alexander, Hilary. \\"Yohji Yamamoto: Historic Fashion Initiative,\\" The Telegraph (London). 23 February 2008.

Binoy received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2005. Biography Binoy Majumdar was born in Myanmar (erstwhile Burma) on 17 September 1934. His family later moved to what is now Thakurnagar West Bengal in India. Binoy loved mathematics from his early youth. He completed 'Intermediate' (pre-University) from the Presidency College of the University of Calcutta. Although he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering graduate from Bengal Engineering College, now renamed Indian Institute of Engineering Science & Technology, Calcutta, in 1957, Binoy turned to poetry later in life. He translated a number of science texts from the Russian to Bengali. When Binoy took to writing, the scientific training of systematic observation and enquiry of objects found a place, quite naturally, in his poetry. His first book of verse was Nakshatrer Aloy (in the light of the stars). However, Binoy Majumdar's most famous piece of work to date is Phire Esho, Chaka (Come back, O Wheel, 1960), which was written in the format of a diary. The book is dedicated to Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, a fellow-Calcuttan and contemporary of Majumdar. Professor Narayan Ch Ghosh has written number of articles on the writings of Binoy Majumder analysing mathematical aspects of Binoy's poems. According to Ghosh Phire Esho, Chaka(Come back, O Wheel) published during 1960 was reflection of Binoy's mind for recalling progress - wheel symbolizes. Professor Ghosh had described 'Balmikir Kabita' of Binoy Majumder was continuation of Ratnakar Balmiki (first poet) through 'Balmikir Pratibha' by Rabindranath Thakur. Ghosh stated that Binoy's poem 'Eka Eka Katha Bali'is a Lyrics to Lonely Talk like a vision of poetic melancholy by John Milton Or like 'Teach me half the gladness/That thy brain must know;/Such harmonious madness/ From my lips would flow,/The world should listen then, as I am listening now' by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Though he knew his predecessor Bankim Chandra, first successful Novelist in Bengali - Binoy's mother tongue, had written 'Keo Kakhno Eka Thakiona' (No one lives alone).  Hungry Generation  During the 1960s, he had joined the Hungry generation movement for a short time but departed because of differences with its leader Shakti Chattopadhyay. However, he had published several poems in the Hungryalist bulletins and one of them viz., 'Ekti Ujwal Maach' became quite famous and popular among academicians. After his disagreement with Shakti Chattopadhyay and Sandipan Chattopadhyay, he had himself written a Hungryalist broadside against them. He was supportive of Malay Roy Choudhury during his 35-month-long trial. Binoy died in his maternal home in Shimulpur, Thakaurnagar, West Bengal, on 11 December 2006. His work The book, Phire Esho, Chaka, opens with the lines: The period from 1958-1962 saw Binoy's poetry thrive. Apart from Phire Esho, Chaka, he wrote other books, such as: Nakshatrer Aaloy (In the light of the stars), Eeshwariyo (Godly), Adhikantu (Excessive), Aghraaner Anubhutimala (The emotions of the month of Aghran), Balmikir Kabita (The Poetry of Balmiki). An anthology of Binoy's poems was published by Dey's Publishing House of Calcutta under the name Binoy Majumdarer Srestho Kabita (Selected Poems of Binoy Majumdar) in 1981. Binoy's poetry has been appreciated by literary critics. He won several awards such as *Rabindra Puraskar, *Sudhindranath Dutta Puraskar, *Krittibas Puraskar etc., and the most notable award being the *Sahitya Academy Award in 2005, just a year before his death. In the 1980s and 1990s, Binoy was affected by severe mental illness. He tried to commit suicide several times, and stopped writing poetry altogether. Also, the medical treatment he received was inadequate. He moved to the outskirts of Calcutta, in Thakurnagar, and lived with local town folks, a stranger amidst strangers. Binoy had passed into obscurity in his later years, suffered from senility and lived in social seclusion and neglect. He did not have a family. Binoy Majumdar died on 11 December 2006, at the age of 72. Poetic legacy Binoy has often been regarded by critics as a true successor of Jibanananda Das, the poet who revolutionized Bengali Poetry in the post-Tagore era. Like Jibanananda, Binoy drew his material from bountiful nature, the fields and the jungles and the rivers and the fauna of Bengal. But Binoy's originality lay in his attempt to relate the various elements of nature to one another through objective logic and scientific enquiry. In this respect, some critics like Aryanil Mukhopadhyay, refer to the genre of his work as scientific field journal. Binoy Majumdar was bold and revolutionary in the depiction of sexuality in Poetry. He abundantly used vivid imagery which were sensually potent and Freudian in essence. In a series of pieces (Aamar Bhuttay Tel etc.), where he gives an explicit and graphic description of sexual intercourse, Binoy, once again, lays strong emphasis on the physiology of the process, and takes to a journalistic narration. Binoy was one of the original participants in the Hungry generation ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶∞‡¶ø ‡¶Ü‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßã‡¶≤‡¶® literary movement spearheaded by Shakti Chattopadhyay, Samir Roychoudhury and Malay Roy Choudhury. Binoy has always been somewhat obscure among readers of Bengali Poetry. He was quite ahead of his time in breaking norms of contemporary literature. Some of his poems are difficult to decipher at the first go, and require multiple readings. His writings are unconventional because they often appear as neutral scientific reportage, and not poetry in its usual romanticized self. In this, Binoy readers can perhaps trace back his background as a Mathematician. Binoy builds up all his imagery, nuances, lyricism, and poetic discovery on the skeleton of scientific reasoning and factual observations. Binoy Majumer has used mathematical concepts in his poetry. Legacy is, usually poets avoid mathematics; and therefore, he was not properly understood by the Begali poets and Binoy was not most popular one, though exceptional. During last few years Professor Narayan Ch Ghosh, mathematician, has analysed his poems from mathematical stand point. He has written number of articles in different journals. Those extraordinary writings have opened a new window for assessment of Binoy from different point. Now revaluation has started.  Awards  Binoy is awarded two big literary awarded some years ago before his death. He is awarded Rabindra Puraskar for his Kabyasamgra 2 ( 2nd Poem collection) in 2005. He is also awarded Sahitya Akdemi Award for Haspatale Lekha Kabitaguchha ( Poetry written in hospital) in 2005.

This line of airships was developed through many versions and assigned various designators as the airship designation system changed in the post World War II era. These versions included airships configured for both anti-submarine warfare and airborne early warning (AEW) missions. Design and development The initial version, designated ZPN-1, was a follow-on to the M-class blimp for patrol missions. The Nan ship used a significantly larger envelope than the M-ship although their overall lengths were similar. Two Wright R-1300 Cyclone 7 single-row, air-cooled radial engines powered the N-Class blimps.Sky Ships: A History of the Airship in the United States Navy, Althoff, W.F., Pacifica Press, c1991, An initial contract was awarded to the Goodyear Aircraft Company for the prototype N-class blimp in the late 1940s, with delivery of the first on in 1952.\\"Navy Airship Longer Than Football Field.\\" Popular Mechanics, September 1952, p. 117, bottom. The ZPN-1 designation was changed to ZPG-1 in 1954, and then to SZ-1A in 1962. The envelope capacity for the ZPN-1 was and used the gas helium for lift. The ZPN-1 was followed by an order for four improved N-class blimps that were delivered in 1954. These airships were designated ZP2N, and re-designated in 1954 as the ZPG-2. Three of the ZP2N airships were modified for an airborne early warning mission in the mid-1950s and were designated, originally, ZP2N-1W but at delivery were designated ZPG-2W. Their designation was changed to EZ-1B in 1962. The envelope capacity of these airships exceeded . The ZPG-2W was equipped with the AN/APS-20 radar with its antenna installed beneath the gondola. An AN/APS-69 height-finding radar antenna was mounted on top of the envelope. The engines were installed in the control car and drove the propellers through extended shafts. The airship carried a crew of 21 to 25 and had an endurance capability of over 200 hours. The first ZPG-2W was delivered to the Navy at NAS Lakehurst in May 1955. Operationally the ZPG-2W was used to fill radar gaps in the North American early-warning network between the Contiguous Barrier and the Inshore Barrier during the Cold War. In a demonstration of the ability to stay on-station autonomously for considerably extended periods, ZPG-2 \\"Snow Bird\\" (BuNo 141561), pilot in command Cdr. Jack R. Hunt USN, supported by a naval crew of 12 plus a civilian flight engineer from Goodyear, made a record-breaking non-stop flight across the Atlantic and back. The airship departed NAS South Weymouth, Massachusetts, on Monday 4 March 1957, reaching the south-west tip of Portugal by the evening of 7 March despite adverse headwinds for some of the way, passed by Casablanca, Morocco, on the morning of 8 March, then turned back westwards over the Cape Verde Islands towards the Caribbean Sea, eventually landing at NAS Key West, Florida, on the evening of 15 March. The flight had covered a distance of in 264.2 hours, and in doing so had not only broken the lighter- than-air distance record of set by the Graf Zeppelin rigid airship in 1929 but also the aircraft endurance record without refuelling.\\"Kite balloons to airships: the Navy's lighter-than-air experience\\", ed. Roy A. Grossnick, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C., 1987 One of the ZPG-2 airships was built or modified with external engines to test systems for the follow on ZPG-3W airships and is some times referred to as a ZPG-2 1/2. A ZPG-3W of Airship Airborne Early Warning Squadron ONE (ZW-1) in 1960. The follow-on and larger AEW blimp was the ZPG-3W, the largest non-rigid airship built to ever enter military service. It was used to fill radar gaps in the North American early-warning network during the Cold War between the Contiguous Barrier and the Inshore Barrier. The popular name for the ZPG-3W was Vigilance. The ZPG-3W was unique in that the huge antenna for the early warning radar was enclosed inside the helium-filled envelope. Four airships were delivered to the U.S. Navy. The first flight of the ZPG-3W was in July 1958. The envelope of the blimp was used as a radome for the radar antenna, thus providing the airship with a clean aerodynamic shape. The airship was long and was almost high, containing some 1,500,000 cubic feet (42,450 cubic meters)https://www.britannica.com/technology/ZPG-3W. The endurance time of the airship could extend for days. This model of the N-class blimp was the largest non-rigid airship ever flown. The ZPG-3W Vigilance was the last of the airships built for the U.S. Navy. The July 6, 1960, crash of a Lakehurst-based airship east of Long Beach Island killed 18 sailors, a loss that added pressure on the program. The Navy subsequently decommissioned its airship units at NAS Glynco, Brunswick, Georgia, and at Lakehurst on October 31, 1961. On August 31, 1962, the last two ZPG-3W ships made a ceremonial last flight over Lakehurst ‚Äî the base log noted, \\"This flight terminates operation of non- rigid airships at Lakehurst,\\" Steingold said.\\"After 50 years, Navy resumes airship program\\", Navy Times, Kirk Moore, October 27, 2011 The specially designed and built AN/APS-70 Radar with its massive internal antenna was the best airborne radar system built for detecting other aircraft because its low frequency penetrated weather and showed only the more electronically visible returns. A large radome on top of the envelope held the height-finding radar. In 1986, a ZPG-2W envelope was used for the construction of the Piasecki PA-97 Helistat. On 1 July 1986, the PA-97 crashed immediately after liftoff on a test flight, killing one its pilots. Survivors Two N-class blimp control cars are currently located at the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola, Florida. The cockpit from the control car for ZPG-2, BuNo 141561, also known as Snow Bird, has been restored and is on display at the museum. Launching from NAS South Weymouth, Massachusetts in March 1957, this airship made two crossings of the Atlantic before touching down at NAS Key West, Florida. All told, Snow Bird spent just over eleven days aloft in covering 9,448 miles without refueling. For his performance on the flight, the airship commander, CDR Jack R. Hunt, USN, received the Harmon International Trophy (e.g., Harmon Trophy) for Aeronautics.http://www.navalaviationmuseum.org/attractions/aircraft- exhibits/item/?item=zpg-2_snowbird Following its deflation in 1962, the control car of ZPG-3W number 2, BuNo 144243, was stored for many years at NAS Lakehurst. New Jersey. It is currently recorded as in storage at the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola, Florida awaiting restoration.http://www.navalaviationmuseum.org/ Following storage at NAS Lakehurst, It had reportedly been in storage at AMARC / 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona from at least 1993 until being relocated to the National Naval Aviation Museum (NNAM), at NAS Pensacola in 1995. At some point post-1995, the control car was returned to the 309 AMARG at Davis-Monthan AFB due to space limitations at NNAM. Although currently residing in unprotected storage, it still represents a far less humid environment and protects the control car from further deterioration until it can be returned to NNAM for eventual restoration and display. Under the 1962 unified Department of Defense air vehicle designation system, the ZPG-3W was re-designated the EZ-1C in late 1962. Designation systems Under the designation system established in April 1947, the first N-class airships were given the Navy designation of ZPN-1, (Z = lighter-than-air; P = patrol; N = type/class). In April 1954, the designation system was changed to mimic that used for heavier-than-air naval aircraft. With this change, the designation for the ZPN-1 became the ZPG-1 (Z = lighter-than-air; P = patrol; G=Goodyear (manufacturer); 1=first version). In the 1962 system, the ZPG-1 designation was changed to SZ-1A (S=anti-submarine warfare; Z=lighter-than-air type; 1=first vehicle in the type; A=first model in the series). The designations for later model blimps followed similarly.

But like all intelligent beings, he can also have his foolish moments and can make emblematic mistakes that people can learn from. For example, according to a traditional Secwepemc story, he once decided that he had to climb into a tree and spin a web like a spider. The only result of this misguided idea was that he left behind clumps of his hair in the tree. This magical hair, however, became wila (Bryoria fremontii), a species of lichen which is sometimes also called 'wile' (pronounced weel-eh) in the Secwepemc language. In some other Interior Salish cultures, he went into the tree for other reasons; for example, in Colville- Okanagan culture, Coyote was dropped into the tree by some swans he'd grabbed in a hunt.

In one episode also a Vauxhall 30/98 can be seen. There are no further details regarding his family, although he does refer to an Aunt Penelope (who sends him weighty rock cakes by post) in \\"Dead Man's Treasure\\" and a 13-year-old nephew in \\"Legacy of Death\\". By The New Avengers, Steed had moved out to the country, to a manor house known as \\"Steed's Stud\\", and was no longer driving vintage cars, but contemporary Jaguars instead. =The Avengers= During the first season Steed's character was a more rough-and-tumble operative than the suave, sophisticated gentleman he became during the Gale and Peel eras. His most common style of dress as Dr. Keel's sidekick was a trenchcoat and suit, though the famous bowler hat and umbrella appeared as early as \\"The Frighteners\\", the 15th episode to be aired. Most of the first-season episodes are lost, but Macnee hints in his memoir that they initially appeared earlier.Patrick Macnee: The Avenger Returns: Blind in One Ear (1989) During the show's budget-strained first season, Macnee supplemented his on-screen wardrobe with numerous items from his own wardrobe, including the bowler and umbrella. By the second season, Steed had dispensed with the trenchcoat and was found wearing the familiar three-piece suits with which he is afterward identified. He was initially shown answering to several different superiors such as \\"One-Ten\\" and \\"Charles\\". During most of the Gale-Peel era the source of his orders was left a mystery. For the final season of the original series (the Tara King era) Steed was shown taking his orders from an obese man called \\"Mother\\" who used a wheelchair (and once from a blind woman named \\"Father\\"). In The New Avengers, Steed was shown working on his own, and it was suggested that he had moved into an administrative role in British intelligence, although that did not stop him from directly participating in missions. Out of all his partners, he was closest to Mrs Peel; while their interaction was often laced with dry, sardonic wit on both sides, he respected her as an equal, and owed her his life on more than a few occasions. Regarding the question of whether they had a sexual relationship at any time, Macnee thought they went to bed on a very regular basis (just not in view of the camera), Rigg thought they were engaged in a very enjoyable extended flirtation that ultimately went nowhere, and Brian Clemens said he wrote them with the idea they'd had an affair before Emma's first appearance in the series.http://theavengers.tv/forever/faqs-1.htm Description One of Steed's trademarks was his impeccable dress, often consisting of a three-piece suit with bowler hat and ever-present umbrella which was designed by British umbrella maker Swaine Adeney Brigghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr6ElmsSMZMhttps://www.swaineadeneybrigg.com/products/brigg- whangee#:~:text=The%20classic%20John%20Steed%20(%20Patrick,classic%20'Brigg%20Whangee'%20umbrella.. His bowler and umbrella were in fact his favourite weapons. Steed's umbrella, with its distinctive whangee handle, was known for containing a concealed sword, though he seldom actually drew the blade, more frequently using the umbrella itself as a striking and hooking weapon. Other specially-equipped umbrellas included one that featured a sound recorder, one with a tip that could emit knock out gas, one with a camera hidden under the handle for covert photography (\\"The Cybernauts\\"), and one that contained measures of whisky. (The swordstick featured in the title sequence was made by venerable English umbrella maker James Smith & Sons.) The bowler had a metal plate concealed in its lining and was very hard, it could stop bullets and knock down opponents. Although he was witty and highly sagacious, he was also a suave and ruthless spy. In combat, he is an excellent swordsman and adept at unarmed combat. A bon vivant, he also seemed to be something of an oenophile, having an impeccable palate and a love for champagne. When meeting Tara King, Emma Peel informed her that Steed liked his tea stirred anti-clockwise. Influence The professional footballer, Steed Malbranque is widely reported to have been named after John Steed on account of his parents having seen their child as the epitome of Britishness. Fans of John Steed sometimes call themselves \\"Steedophiles\\". =Other versions of Steed= *In the 1971 stage play of The Avengers, Steed was played by Simon Oates. *In the South African radio version of The Avengers which ran from 1971 to 1973, Steed was played by Donald Monat. *In the 1998 film, Steed was played by Ralph Fiennes. As this film was set in the 1990s and Steed seemed younger than before, this represented a reimagining of the character. *In 1991's Doctor Who Monthly #173, Gary Russell and artists Mike Collins and Steve Pini show Captain Britain about to hit Steed when Emma Peel shows up behind him. *John Steed and Emma Peel are spotted in the crowd in Kingdom Come #2 (1996) by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, where they are both in a bar scene. *John Steed and Emma Peel appeared in Superman #13 (1988), where John Byrne and Karl Kesel give us the crime-fight duo ‚Äì unnamed, of course. *In the new Big Finish audio series The Avengers ‚Äì The Lost Episodes (2014‚Äìpresent), Steed is played by Julian Wadham.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Moscavide e Portela. History The apartment blocks of the civil parish of Portela de Sacav√©m In toponymic terms, Portela gets its name from two Portuguese definitions: portela is derived from a corruption of the Latin portulla or portella, which means small door or entryway, since it can be considered the accessway to Lisbon (and/or south part of the Tagus estuary); the term portela is also, literally a point where a road or street forms a bend or angle, ordinarily in a bottleneck or tributary. Geographically, the second statement is also true, since the parish's northern limits are cornered by two important bends (Avenida Infante Dom Henriques-IC17 and IC17-A1). Portela's masterplan was deeply inspired by Swiss architect Le Corbusier's utopian scheme of \\"A Contemporary City for 3 Million People\\" (1922), and its urbanism based on the premise of a modern architecture that was exposed it to the maximum levels of sun, air and nature (as stated in the 1933 Athens Charter of Congr√®s International d'Architecture Moderne). Similarly, in the early part of the 1960s, a development in Buenos Aires had a comparable effect on the future urbanization of Portela; the development was geometric in design, with composite linear roadways around a central centre. In Lisbon, a similar layout was achieved by a New York architect, who was commissioned to construct a development that centred on a large commercial mall in the 1970s (the first of its type to be completed using urban planning concepts in the capital). The idea was to organize apartment blocks around a central commercial structure, in order to create a pole of socio-economic activities. Constituted in 1985, the civil parish of Portela has become a Portuguese reference for urban architecture. In 1965, a draft plan for the future scheme was approved by the Government, implying the expropriation of five farms which were sharing this parcel of land and supplying Lisbon with agricultural goods. The plan, covering an area of 50 hectares, laid out a vision for a future area with 4500 homes and all sort of social equipments, responding to the big demand of housing for the people who were flocking to the Capital in a high number either from the ex-colonies in Africa or from other parts of the country. The early residents of the modern Portela were young couples with their children, many returning from the Portuguese Colonies, others liberal professionasl such as lawyers, engineers, physicians, or judges and some older politicians, ostensibly from middle- to upper-middle class. The growth of the region was influenced by the youth culture, a bohemian collection of punk, metal, anarchist and others on the vanguard of the youth movement, who would spend time in the Bairro Alto district, ending their nights in Cais do Sodr√©, Jamaica, T√≥quio or Shangrila. As time evolved, the Association of Portela Homeowners, the parish Church and the Junta Freguesia became more active in the activities of the residents. By the 1990s, the youth movement had moved on to areas of Alc√¢ntara-Mar, the Kapital or the Kremlin. At this time, the Esplanada da Portela (the main strip), with its open-air green-spaces attracted more of the local residents, and slowly the tennis courts and football field were constructed to fix the local population. As the population continued to age, many married and moved away, although some remained in the region while others moved closer to the river's edge, as the Expo 98 lands were repurposed for residential living. Geography The modern blocks of Portela in front of the Jardim das Descobertas The Church of Cristo Rei da Portela, a modern church built by local donations Bordering the urban parishes of Moscavide, Sacav√©m, Prior Velho and the municipality of Lisbon (parish of Santa Maria dos Olivais), Portela includes approximately 20,000 inhabitants in an area of about one km¬≤. It is located barely two kilometres from Lisbon's International Airport and at the intersection of two of Portugal's main road axisways: the A1 (Lisbon-Oporto motorway) and A12-IC17 CRIL (Circular Regional Interior de Lisboa) inter-urban ring-roadway (linking it directly to the Vasco da Gama bridge and the southern part of the Tagus estuary. The parish is situated on a gentle slope running west to east forming a slight plateau. Starting from the southern edge of the Seminary of Olivais, the southern border extends east to the on/off-ramps of the Vasco da Gama bridge, then follows the motorway northeast until the intersection of the A1-E1 cloverleaf interchange. The border then follows the A1-E1 west until the interchange at Avenida Mal. Craveiro Lopes, where it bypasses the Avenida Dr. Alfredo Bensa√∫de, instead following the Estrada da Circunvala√ß√£o until the Largo dos Bombeiros, before returning to the Seminary. It is several blocks north of the Parque das Na√ß√µes (), which lies in the neighbouring Santa Maria dos Olivais. Its demographics identify an area that includes 41% youth, while only 5.6% seniors, indicating a relatively young population; infant natality (130) to mortality (63) from 1997 identifies a community that is growing (1997). Portela is a high-density residential neighborhood situated on the northeastern section of Lisbon's city boundary. It is the home of 11809 people, most of whom commute to Lisbon for work and leisure. The Commercial Centre of Portela (), hosts one of the higher builduing in Lisbon, Conc√≥rdia (80m), the Church of Cristo Rei da Portela, the Parque Desportivo da Associa√ß√£o dos Moradores da Portela, the Seminary of Olivais and the parks of Almeida Garrett and Descobertas, are examples of the urban social and cultural structures that have attracted residents to the area in the past. The Centro Comercial is situated in the heart of the civil parish, at the former-centre of the communities traditional centre. It was remodelled and reinvigorated to include new shops such as computer and technology, spas, clothing/apparel outlets and shoe shops, in addition to banking. The Church of Cristo Rei da Portela is the pride of the Catholic faith community; erected slowly, through local contributions, it is a significant modern architectural design uncommon to the other Portuguese styles. The parish has a Complex with two pools, that is operated by the municipal company GesLoures. One pool of the Complex (25 x 12,5 meters) is used for swim competitions, training and more advanced classes, while the other (12.5 x 8 metres) is used for more basic swimming classes. The facilities were one of the few buildings to the constructed to be energy efficient, recycling energy, utilizing solar panels and reducing the consume of energy and emissions of carbon dioxide. The Parque Desportivo has three tennis courts and field, an esplanade and a swimming pool. Generally, the parish is a linear alignment of roads, comprising a hundred 10- to 12-storey buildings, that form a rectangle which has a circular shaped shopping centre and a 20-storey tower at its very middle point. With a large population density (approximately 12430 inhabitants per square kilometre), the parish is equipped with many collective structures including water supplies, sewage treatment, garbage pickup (with access to landfill in Vila Franca de Xira) and recently the canalization of natural gas. In the northwest corner of the civil parish, on the corner of Avenida do Ralis and the Estrada da Circunvala√ß√£o, remains a degraded part of this modern civil parish, consisting of dozens of bungalows, abandoned buildings and ruins.

Its story concerns the title character, a young woman brought up as part of a team of assassins, charged with killing the warlords that threaten the uneasy peace in Feudal Japan in the aftermath of its long Sengoku civil war period. Azumi was originally published by Shogakukan and serialized in Big Comic Superior, and received an Excellence Prize at the 1997 Japan Media Arts Festival and the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1998. The manga was later adapted to two feature films starring Aya Ueto (2003's Azumi and 2005's Azumi 2: Death or Love), and a video game and a stage play in 2005.  Plot  Azumi focuses upon the life of the titular young female assassin. The manga begins an indeterminate number of years after the Battle of Sekigahara. As Azumi begins her duty, the manga introduces its characters into mainstream history. Many of the early missions that Azumi undertakes are the assassinations of the prominent supporters and generals of the Toyotomi clan, against whom Tokugawa Ieyasu expected to again go to war. The manga \\"reveals\\" that many of the Toyotomi leaders who conveniently died of diseases or accidents prior to the final confrontation between the Toyotomi and Tokugawa were actually victims of assassinations by Azumi and her comrades, thus indicating to the reader when the events were taking place. Azumi is raised by an old man known as Jiji (Grandfather), whose name is later revealed to be Gensai Obata, as the only girl among ten students. They are secluded from the society in a tiny valley called Kiridani (Fog Valley) to such an extent that they do not know the difference between men and women, what a baby is, or customs like marriage. Early in the manga, as part of their training, Azumi and her comrades are ordered to go to Shimotani, a hidden community of ninja who became farmers, to learn the basics of ninjutsu. The manga sets a very chilling tone early on. The 10 erabareta senshi (chosen warriors), who are all young children (Azumi has her first period well after her first missions, so she appears to be somewhere between 10‚Äì12 years of age at the onset of the manga) are told by Jiji that they have completed their training. For their first mission, they are to form a pair with whomever among the 10 that they feel the closest. Azumi pairs with Nachi, and all others pair with their closest friends. Having formed the pairs, Jiji tells them their first mission is to kill their partner‚Äîwhoever is too weak to kill their partner is too weak to fulfill their life's missions, and will not be allowed to survive. The ten children each fight their respective duels, and Azumi slays Nachi, an event which appears to deeply traumatize Azumi, but she hides her feelings, as do the others. Then, their second mission was to massacre all 53 residents of the peaceful ninja village, including their teacher, women and children, as they know of the group's existence. Azumi slays three men and four teenagers but is unable to kill a woman with baby, a task which one of her comrades quickly accomplishes. The remaining five warriors proceed to go on assassination missions of the various important supporters of the Toyotomi faction. As the manga proceeds, it evokes various moral concepts such as the morality of assassinations (and killing in general), the dehumanization effect of politics, as well as leading the reader to question basic assumptions of right and wrong. For example, throughout much of the middle volumes of the manga (Vol. 8-19), Azumi frequently fights and kills many bandits‚Äîmany of whom are depicted robbing, murdering, and raping innocent victims. Azumi does not question that her killing such bandits is right, and few readers probably question her righteousness. Later on in the manga, the political background to the reason for the banditry is revealed. The Tokugawa ruling family deposed and ended many previously prominent daimy≈ç feudal lords who opposed them leaving the samurai and mercenaries in their employ without work or any means to live‚Äîtherefore they resorted to banditry. Azumi questions whether it was right for her to have killed so many men who had been driven to banditry not by their own choice. A consistent recurring theme is the contrast between Azumi and other prominent characters. Azumi is compared to a bodhisattva‚Äîa kind of enlightened being. This is indicative of the theme in Azumi where characters around Azumi are motivated by a variety of obsessions. Some are motivated by a kind of blind idealism, others by religion, others by a lust for battle, greed, or even normally sanctified motivations like honor. Not all the forces (particularly those motivated by more noble incentives, like a pair of ninja assassins whom Azumi kills, who are participating in the planning of a revolt as the only way for a ninja community to survive) are depicted as if their single-minded drive towards their goals are somehow evil. However, nonetheless, in each case, those who are attached intensely to something in the world are killed by Azumi, while she, who seemingly has little attachment to the earthly world and few personal desires, survives.  Adaptations  =Film series= Azumi was loosely adapted into an action film directed by Ryuhei Kitamura in 2003. A sequel, Azumi 2: Death or Love, directed by Shusuke Kaneko, followed in 2005. = Video game = An action game for PlayStation 2, based on manga's original story, was developed by Gargoyle Mechanics and released in Japan only by Entertainment Software Publishing in 2005.

He was a wholesaler, retailer and shipowner as well as a land owner and developer. Biography Meyer was born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was one of twelve children born to of Jacob Peter Meyer (1781‚Äì1856) and Ingeborg Marie Barth Muus (1781‚Äì1835). His father was a successful merchant, shipowner and timber wholesaler. As the son of a wealthy businessman, he received his education in France and England. He entered the father's firm in 1848. He also became involved in the business enterprise of his wife's father, Andreas Tofte. In 1852, following the death of his father-in-law, he took over the family enterprises. In 1856, upon the death of his father, he inherited his father's company. Thorvald Meyer also built a personal fortune primarily on real estate development in Oslo and also in forestry including forest properties at Nord-Odal in Hedmark. He had inherited from his father, the southern part of Meyerl√∏kka in the district of St. Hanshaugen. The property had been acquired by his father between 1807 and 1856. In 1859 he created a plan for the development of the property together with his brother-in-law, Thomas Johannessen Heftye (1822‚Äì1886). In 1862, Meyer acquired and developed the then almost uninhabited area of Gr√ºnerl√∏kka. Thorvald Meyers gate, one of the main thoroughfares running north to south through the district of Gr√ºnerl√∏kka, was named in his honor. Personal life Meyer was married to Annichen Mathea Tofte (1820‚Äì1900), daughter of Andreas Tofte (1795‚Äì1852) and Christine S√∏eberg (1797‚Äì1848). The couple resided in a property located at Karl Johans gate 37 in Oslo. The building had originally been owned by Andreas Tofte. After a fire in 1867, the building was destroyed. A new residence was completed for the family in 1869 based upon designs by architect Wilhelm von Hanno (1826‚Äì1882). Their daughter Ragnhild Meyer (1849‚Äì1937) was married to diplomat Axel Heiberg (1848‚Äì1932). Their daughter Thea Meyer (1846‚Äì1922) was married to Prime Minister Christian Homann Schweigaard. And their daughter Ingeborg Meyer (1843‚Äì1882) was married to Lord Chamberlain Herman Severin L√∏venskiold (1838‚Äì1910), the son of Otto Joachim L√∏venskiold. Meyer donated several of his properties to the city. He was also a supporter of the arts, in particular the theater. Thorvald Meyer was appointed Commander of the 1st Class of Order of St. Olav. He died during 1909 and was buried at V√•r Frelsers Gravlund in Oslo.

During his lifetime, Likhachov was considered the world's foremost scholar of the Old Russian language and its literature. He was revered as \\"the last of old St Petersburgers\\", and as \\"a guardian of national culture\\". Due to his high profile as a Soviet dissident during his later life, Likhachov was often referred to as \\"Russia's conscience\\". Life and career Dmitry Likhachov was born in Saint Petersburg. From his early childhood he had a passion for literature, even though his parents did not approve of this interest. In a 1987 interview with David Remnick, Likhachov recalled how he had, \\"watched the February and October Revolutions from his window.\\"David Remnick (1994), Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire, page 104. In 1923, at only 16 years old, Likhachov entered the Department of Linguistics and Literature of Leningrad State University. He attended the Roman-Germanic and Slavic-Russian sections at the same time, undertaking two diplomas. At the university the young Likhachov met many outstanding scientists and developed his own way of thinking. Likhachov graduated in 1928 from the Leningrad University. In 1928, at the end of his studies, Likhachyov was arrested and accused of being a member of what Remnick called, \\"a students' literary group called the Cosmic Academy of Sciences\\", which \\"posed about as great a threat to the Kremlin as the Harvard Lampoon does to the White House.\\" For his election as an Academician, Likhachyov had presented a short report, in which he poked fun at the new spelling rules of 1918 and urged that they be \\"reformed\\" by restoring the banned letter \\"Yat\\". After his arrest, Likhachyov was confronted with the paper by a Soviet secret police interrogator, who screamed, \\"What do you mean by language reform? Perhaps we won't even have any language at all under Socialism!\\" After nine months in jail, the young scientist was unlawfully exiled without trial and spent five years in the USSR's first concentration camp, located on the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea. Deported to the Solovki Special Purpose Camp, he spent 5 years studying \\"criminal folklore\\" (as he termed it). Dmitry Likhachov wrote his first scientific article, \\"Card Games of Criminals\\", in the camp. He didn't play cards himself, but was a keen observer. He also gathered much material about the language of thieves and later published articles and a book about thieves' slang and customs. At the camp, hard work, poor living conditions and illness dramatically damaged Likhachov's health, but he survived. On the Solovetsky Islands he met both exiled Russian intellectuals and real criminals, who happened to save his life. As Dmitry Likhachov said many years later, \\"At the Solovki, I understood that every person is a person.\\" Whilst on the islands, for some period of time Dmitry Likhachov worked as a member of the Criminological Cabinet, organizing a labor colony for teenagers and saving them from death caused by hunger, drugs, and cold. On the night of 28 October 1929, he was summoned from a visit with his parents and ordered to join a party of 300 prisoners destined for execution. Wishing to spare his parents the trauma, Likhachyov told them that he had been summoned for night work and that they should not wait for him. He then hid behind a wood pile and listened as the three hundred prisoners were shot and thrown into a mass grave. The next morning, Likhachyov returned from his hiding place as a completely different man. In a 1987 interview with David Remnick, Likhachyov recalled the events of that night and concluded, \\"The executioner is older than me, and he is still alive.\\"Remnick (1994), pages 104-105. From 1931, Likhachov was a worker on the construction of the Stalin White Sea‚ÄìBaltic Canal until his release. Likhachyov returned to Leningrad and started his spectacular scholarly career in the Pushkin House (as the Russian Literature Institute is known), which spanned more than 60 years and saw the publication of more than 500 scholarly works. Likhachov didn't stop his work even during the Siege of Leningrad. He believed that Russia was an integral and indivisible part of European civilization, contrary to \\"Euroasiatic\\" views of Russia popular with Lev Gumilev, Boris Rybakov, and many other contemporaries. Likhachov worked for five years as a proofreader in the publishing house of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In 1936, thanks to petitions by the president of the Academy of Sciences, Aleksandr Karpinsky, Dmitry Likhachyov's criminal record was cleared. In 1938 the talented scientist was noticed and invited to the Department of Old Russian Literature of the Institute of Russian Literature (known as the Pushkin House). Dmitry Likhachyov worked here until the end of his life. Old Russian literature, which at that time did not receive much academic attention, became the main scientific interest of Dmitry Likhachyov who, by the beginning of the 1940s, was one of the most renowned specialists in this sphere. In 1941 Likhachyov presented his thesis \\"The Novgorod Annalistic Corpus of the 12th Century\\". World War II brought new trials. Likhachov, together with his wife and twin daughters, survived the horrors of the siege of Leningrad (1941-1944). He described his experience in a story, full of harsh details, exposing different types of people and their heroic or appalling behavior when faced with starvation and death. In 1942, completely exhausted by hunger and cold, Dmitry Likhachyov started to gather materials on medieval poetry and soon published the book Defense of the Old Russian Cities. In 1943 Likhachyov and his entire family were exiled to Kazan, supposedly because of the \\"connection with the Solovetsky Camp\\". But by the end of the war they had returned to Leningrad. In 1947 Dmitry Likhachov received his Doctorate in Philology, having presented his thesis \\"Essays on the History of Annalistic Literary Forms of the 11th‚Äì16th Centuries\\". Three years later he became a professor at the Leningrad State University. From 1953 he was a corresponding member - and from 1970 a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Dmitry Likhachyov's conquest of the scientific world was definitely a triumphant one. 1950 marked the publication of Likhachov‚Äôs two-volume edition containing unique, important literary works translated into the modern Russian language: The Primary Chronicle, a history of Kievan Rus' from the 9th to the 12th centuries, and The Lay of the Host of Igor, an account based on a failed raid by Prince Igor Svyatoslavich of Novgorod-Seversk against the Cumans in 1185. Dmitry Likhachov was not a scientist detached from everyday life. From the 1950s he began a campaign to save the wooden temples of the Russian North and to preserve the historical appearance of Russian cities. He helped found the museums of Dostoevsky, Pushkin and Pasternak. In 1953 Likhachov was admitted into the Soviet Academy of Sciences as a corresponding member. He defended Andrei Sakharov, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and other dissidents during their persecution by Soviet authorities. In the 1960s Likhachyov was one of the initiators of the movement for the protection of historical monuments, libraries and archives. Thanks to Likhachyov many monuments were saved, including Marina Tsvetaeva's flat in Moscow, the Nevsky Prospect in Leningrad (which was supposed to be turned into a shopping street) and Aleksandr's Garden. In the 1980s he headed the Soviet (later renamed Russian) Cultural Fund, supporting the process of the Orthodox Church's reclaiming of its temples, formerly appropriated by the Soviet government. The scientist also participated in the preservation of national minorities in danger of dying out while aiding the return to Russia of √©migr√© public and cultural figures. In 1980 Likhachov was one of the members of the Academy of Sciences who refused to sign a letter requesting the expulsion the famous scientist Andrei Sakharov from the Academy because of Sakharov's public disapproval of the dispatch of Soviet troops to Afghanistan in 1979. Despite his busy social life, Likhachov still spent a lot of time on scientific work. Focusing on Old Russian literature, he developed the concept of artistic time and space. In 1969 the researcher was awarded with the USSR State Prize for his work \\"Poetics of Old Russian Literature\\". Dmitry Likhachov gained worldwide recognition as a theorist of culture and as a publicist. In the 1980s he developed a concept that considered the problems of humanization and the reorientation of educational goals and ideas. The scientist viewed culture as a historical memory, as a process of accumulation, rather than consecutive changes. This was also the theoretical basis for Likhachov‚Äôs attention to ancient monuments, especially in architecture. Inspired by the works of Vladimir Vernadsky, Dmitry Likhachov suggested the idea of a ‚Äúhomosphere‚Äù- a human sphere of the Earth. His original contribution to general science was also the development of a new discipline called the ecology of culture, which was defined as an essential sphere of human life. One of the ideas of Likhachov's concept was the correlation between culture and nature. In his book Poetics of the Gardens (1982), park and garden art was for the first time considered as a semiotic reflection of major cultural and artistic styles and their corresponding ideologies. In Moscow and St. Petersburg, in 1986 he created the International Association of intellectuals and creative \\"Myr Culture\\", with the writer Nicolaj Sanvelian, the Italian economist and writer Giancarlo Pallavicini and other leading writers, artists and scientists, he was inspiring and President for many years.Various editions of the World of Culture Association have been published, and \\"Forum of the artistic intelligentsia of Russia, Moscow, Boltscioj Theatre, 1995. In 1986 he was elected the first President of the Russian Cultural Fund. In his 1980s and 1990s, he became more of a public figure, serving as an informal advisor to St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. In October 1993 he signed the Letter of Forty-Two. In the same year, he became the first person to be named an Honorary Citizen of St Petersburg. He also presided over the commission set up to prepare for Alexander Pushkin's bicentenary. Likhachov thought about his life journey as a vertical movement, towards the heavenly home. The reflections of his experience as a person are written in the book ‚ÄúReminiscences‚Äù (1995). During the first visit to Rome Gorbachev, Myr Culture has officially handed over, on behalf of the intellectual-creative in the world, a cultural program, called \\"Manifesto of the three\\" by the signatories founders of the association, the Russian spokesman Zagladin presented the world's press at the Foro Italico, in 1998, as an instance of cultural freedom for Russia and for the world, signed by Dmitry Likhachov, Nicolaj Sanvelian e Giancarlo Pallavicini.http://www.giancarlopallavicini.it/cultura/myr-cultura-in-italia. The last works by Dmitry Likhachov gathered together his general ideas about his native country. The book Thoughts About Russia, completed in 1999, a few days before the author's death, is devoted to Russia'‚Äôs place in world history, its myths and its most characteristic features. The edition Russian Culture was published posthumously in 2000. As a great scientist, Likhachov was a foreign member of the Academies of Sciences of Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia and a corresponding member of the Austrian, American, British, Italian and G√∂ttingen Academies. In 1984 the minor planet 2877 was named after Likhachyov. A year before his death, Likhachov became the very first recipient of the reinstated Order of St. Andrew. Dmitry Likhachov died on 30 September 1999. In 2001 Likhachyov's daughter and George Soros established the Likhachov Philanthropic Fund.  Family  Likhachov married Zinaida Makarova, who devoted her entire life to her husband. They had twin daughters, Vera and Lyudmila.

The Fox farm homestead can still be found on Fox Crescent in the north part of the neighbourhood with its windmill tower now shaded by a large tree. Originally the east side of the neighbourhood was subdivided into large lots, typically 50 by 50 metres. In the 1960s, the west side was developed with smaller lots but mostly large custom homes. At the same time, many lots in the east side of the neighbourhood were subdivided and infill housing was built. Subdivisions have continued through to today, giving Whitehaven a very eclectic housing character. Whitehaven Crescent was built up throughout the mid 1960s as the area's namesake. The south west side of the neighbourhood contains a large park with a playground, with schools including D. Roy Kennedy Public School and Woodroffe High School. In the 1960s there was also a public primary school which operated until 1999 called Whitehaven Public School. It was closed for a few years after much dispute and then was reopened and expanded as a French primary school, called Terre des Jeunes. Whitehaven has plenty of transportation links, green space and shopping centres. The Carlingwood and Lincoln Fields shopping malls are within walking distance of the neighbourhood.

S. seaport located at Savannah, Georgia. Its facilities for oceangoing vessels line both sides of the Savannah River approximately from the Atlantic Ocean. Operated by the Georgia Ports Authority (GPA), the Port of Savannah competes primarily with the Port of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina to the northeast, and the Port of Jacksonville in Jacksonville, Florida to the south. The GPA operates one other Atlantic seaport in Georgia, the Port of Brunswick, located at Brunswick, Georgia. There are three interior ports linked to the Gulf of Mexico, Port Bainbridge and Port Columbus, and one linked to the Port of Savannah by rail in Cordele, Georgia. Port of Savannah Port of Savannah Between 2000 and 2005 alone, the Port of Savannah was the fastest-growing seaport in the United States, with a compounded annual growth rate of 16.5 percent (the national average is 9.7 percent). On July 30, 2007, the GPA announced that the Port of Savannah had a record year in fiscal 2007, becoming the fourth-busiest and fastest-growing container terminal in the U.S.atlanta.bizjournals.com The GPA handled more than of container traffic during fiscal 2007‚Äì a 14.5 percent increase and a new record for containers handled at the Port of Savannah. In the past five years, the port's container traffic has jumped 55 percent from handled in fiscal 2003 to in fiscal 2007. By 2014, container traffic was up to . In 2018, the Port handled a record 4.35 million twenty-foot equivalent container units (TEUs), a 7.5 percent increase over 2017. In response to the growth in traffic at both Savannah and the Port of Charleston, the Jasper Ocean Terminal, to be the largest port in the country when it is completed, is planned to be built upriver on the Savannah River by the mid 2020s. Major facilities The Port of Savannah was unable to accommodate further terminal growth, which caused it to develop satellite terminal facilities and inland distribution. These facilities include: * Garden City Terminal: Owned and operated by the GPA, the Garden City Terminal is a secured, dedicated container terminal, the largest single-operator container terminal in North America. The facility features 9,693 feet (2,955 m) of continuous berthing and more than 1.1 million square feet (104,000 m2) of covered storage. The terminal is equipped with thirty-six high-speed container cranes (30 super post-Panamax and 6 post-Panamax), as well as an extensive inventory of yard handling equipment. * Ocean Terminal: Also owned and operated by the GPA, the Ocean Terminal is a secured, dedicated breakbulk facility specializing in the rapid and efficient handling of a vast array of forest and solid wood products, steel, RoRo (Roll-on / Roll-off), project shipments and heavy-lift cargoes. The facility features 3,599 feet (1,099 m) of deepwater berthing, approximately 1.425 million square feet (133,000 m2) of covered storage and 99 acres (401,000 m2) of open, versatile storage. * Target Corporation Facility: On September 21, 2005, Governor Sonny Perdue announced that Target Corporation has decided to build a two-million- square-foot import warehouse at the Savannah River International Trade Park, located four miles (6 km) from the Garden City Terminal at the Port of Savannah. The import warehouse opened on June 8, 2007, and handles overseas cargo and merchandise for Target Corporation's Southeast stores. * IKEA Facility: On December 13, 2005, Perdue and IKEA would build a distribution center on at the Savannah River International Trade Park. The first phase of the project consists of a facility, which opened on June 27, 2007. The company also plans to expand the initial facility by approximately in the future. * Heineken USA Facility: Heineken USA opened a distribution center in February 2008 that will handle 4,000 containers a year, moving from breweries in the Netherlands to distributors in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Alabama. The facility will handle 7 million cases of Heineken and Amstel brand beverages every year. * Savannah Port Terminal Railroad, a railroad that links the terminal facilities to the Genesee & Wyoming railroad. Maersk Line On April 10, 2007, Maersk Line reported that the port has added the Port of Savannah to its MECL2 service. With the addition, Maersk Line now has five services calling on the Port of Savannah. The MECL2 service will increase Savannah's trade with India, the Middle East and the Mediterranean basin. In 2006, Maersk Line and the GPA signed a twenty- year agreement that would make the Port of Savannah one of its primary ports of call in the South Atlantic. The MECL2 service provides direct service from Chennai/Madras, India, to act as transshipment hub for cargo to and from Visakhapatnam, Calcutta/Haldia, and Bangladesh. Suez Express and East Coast Savannah Express On June 5, 2007, APL announced that it would have two new all-water services to the Port of Savannah, one via the Suez Canal and one via the Panama Canal. The weekly Suez Express (SZX) will provide increased capacity via Savannah to and from India and Southeast Asia, deploying eight vessels. The SZX, which will originate in Singapore, calls on Colombo, Sri Lanka, before Savannah and then returns via Jebel Ali, Port Kelang and then Singapore. It takes 25 days for the SZX service to transit from Singapore to Savannah. The weekly East Coast Savannah Express (ESX), will provide increased capacity between south and central China and Savannah. The ESX will offer a transit time of 22 days from Hong Kong to Savannah, making this service the fastest available to the U.S. East Coast. The ESX originates in Ningbo then call on Shanghai, Chiwan, Hong Kong, Panama and then Savannah, New York, Norfolk, Panama and back to Ningbo.

The lake is 1.4 km in length and 0.8 km in width at its widest part. It is located 2.5 km to the southwest of the Ledo Road, formerly called Stilwell Road, the road the Western Allies started building in 1942 to supply the Chinese armies of Chiang Kai-shek. The area is home to the Tangsa community. Since the improvement of relations between India and Myanmar , the lake has come to play a part in the development of tourism in the nearby Indian Changlang District, which borders on Myanmar. Legends The most common account of the origin of the lake's name is the one told, for instance, on the Changlang District's website (the district is in Arunachal Pradesh, India), which speculates that the name is due to the number of Allied aircraft (on their approach to The Hump) which crashlanded in it during World War II, a story repeated in both the Indian press and in Indian fiction. American sources repeat that account, for instance in the 2008 book by Brendan I. Koerner, Now the Hell Will Start: One Soldier's Flight from the Greatest Manhunt of World War II, about the life of Herman Perry, a U.S. serviceman working on the Ledo Road who fled into the jungle and ended up marrying into the Naga tribe (of which the Tangsa are a subset): \\"The Americans called it the Lake of No Return, on account of all the crashed planes concealed in its depths.\\" At least three more stories explain the name. The second has it that a group of Japanese soldiers returning from battle lost their way and ended up at the lake. There, they were stricken by malaria and died and hence it is called the Lake of No Return. According to a third story, US Army soldiers, working on the Ledo Road, were sent to examine the lake and got trapped by the undergrowth and perished trying to escape. A fourth story says this \\"is the 'lake of no return' [because] retreating British troops in 1942 got lost in quicksand.\\" Adding myth to legend, one author claims he has encountered the name on a document written by one of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, which he claims still hides out in the area. The lake still maintains its reputation; the Indian newspaper The Telegraph reported, in a story on the possible reopening of the Ledo Road in 2007, that \\"close by [Pansaung] is the Lake of No Return ‚Äî the local Bermuda Triangle. According to folklore, aircraft that fly over the lake never return.\\" The lake's reputation is advertised in hopes of making the area more attractive to tourists: \\"Who knows, the ‚ÄòIndian‚Äô Bermuda Triangle might just turn out to be the next tourist-puller of the region.\\" In a recent article Joydeep Sircar has claimed to have solved the 'mystery' behind the Lake of No Return, which he visited in 2002. According to him, none of the legends associated with the name have any basis in fact.

Early life Betbeze was born on November 28, 1928 in Mobile, Alabama, to William, a butcher, and Ethel Betbeze. Betbeze was raised in a strict Roman Catholic family of French Basque descent, and she attended convent schools. Career She captured her first crown in 1949 when she won Mobile's \\"Miss Torch\\" pageant. In 1950, Fox (then Betbeze) entered Miss Alabama for the scholarship opportunities the pageant presented. As Miss Alabama, she traveled to Atlantic City, New Jersey, to compete in the Miss America 1951 pageant. Having been educated in a convent school, she was reluctant to pose in a swimsuit and refused to do so after she won Miss America. That led the swimsuit company, Catalina, to withdraw their sponsorship of the Miss America pageant and eventually brought about the creation of the rival Miss USA pageant. USS Monterey in 1951 Fox's Miss America title, although won in 1950, was for 1951 and is the first Miss America title to be \\"postdated\\" in this manner. Due to the change, there was no Miss America 1950. The Miss America Organization has claimed that Fox's (then Betbeze's) actions were pivotal in directing pageant progress towards recognizing intellect, values, and leadership abilities, rather than focusing on beauty alone. From then on the Miss America pageant concentrated more on scholarship than beauty. Fox was active in the feminist movement. After her one-year reign as Miss America; was active in the NAACP, CORE (Congress of Racial Equality), and SANE (The Committee for a SANE Nuclear Policy); and studied philosophy at the New School for Social Research in New York City. Fox was an opera singer and did gain a reputation in that area. She continued to sing, appearing with the Mobile Opera Guild (now the Mobile Opera), and helped found an off-Broadway theater. Fox's home in Washington, D.C. Personal life She married movie magnate, Matthew Fox, the former president of Universal Pictures, in 1954. They had one daughter, Yolande \\"Dolly\\" Fox Campbell. Her husband died after 10 years of marriage. After her husband's death, she moved to Georgetown, Washington, D.C., purchasing the Newton D. Baker House from Michael Whitney Straight and his then wife Nina Gore Auchincloss. The home had previously been the residence of Jacqueline Kennedy after the assassination or John F. Kennedy in 1963. Fox had a relationship with Cherif Guellal, with whom she raised her grandchild, Yolande Paris Campbell, until Guellal's death in 2009.http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/across-the-nationacross-the- world/2016/washington-social-diary-the-last-of-the-georgetown-dames In the early 1990s Yolande Fox was contacted by the writer Philip Roth, who was researching the Miss America beauty pageant for his novel American Pastoral. Roth studied Fox's scrapbooks and interviewed her about the culture surrounding the pageant in the late 1940s; he later said, \\"She was very smart, very funny....She just opened up whole ideas for me that I couldn't have had on my own.\\"Sykes, Christopher. \\"Researching Miss America,\\" Web of Stories, Mar. 18 2013.

Early history of 102.1 (1947-1988) The radio station now known as 102 JAMZ was originally located in Reidsville, North Carolina, a simulcast of sister station WREV (1220 AM). In 1947, William Manton Oliver, Sr., at that time owner of the local newspaper (The Reidsville Review), applied to the FCC for a permit to construct an FM radio station under the AM's corporate name, Reidsville Broadcasting Company, Inc. After operating for a time under a Construction Permit, the station's license was granted September 6, 1948. At that time, FM was still new and somewhat experimental. Almost all radio listening was shared among AM radio stations. Mr. Oliver's primary purpose for constructing the station was a desire to provide high school football coverage to Reidsville listeners, as WREV (AM) was not allowed to remain on the air after sunset. For almost twenty years, the same programming was carried on both WREV and WREV-FM. The WREV simulcast ended in 1966, when Oliver's son, William Manton Oliver, Jr. began to handle day-to-day operations. WREV-FM became a Christian radio station and assumed the new call letters, WWMO. On September 10, 1977, by chance the day of William Manton Oliver Sr.'s funeral, WREV-FM was sold to new owner George Beasley, a former high school principal. Late in 1986, Beasley began construction of a new tall tower, near the Guilford/Rockingham county line and moved the facility to new studios in Greensboro, NC. Upon completion of construction, with a new, much stronger signal in place, the former Reidsville-only station first actively attempted to reach the Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point metropolitan area. The new \\"BIG 102\\" took the WBIG call letters, recently abandoned by Greensboro's oldest radio station, (an AM facility that \\"went dark\\" [voluntarily turning in its broadcasting license to the FCC and leaving the air permanently]), hired some of WBIG (AM)'s personalities and debuted as a country music station, late in March, 1987. BIG 102's debut was preceded by a computerized countdown created by Dan Robins, who in 1994 was corporate product manager of Smart Computers and Software in Fayetteville, North Carolina.Gina Evans, \\"Radio Countdown,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, June 5, 1994. WBIG's initial Arbitron ratings were fairly strong, but settled back over time. Through the four ratings \\"books\\" in 1988, the station's 12+ \\"shares\\" (a measure of the percentage of listeners aged 12 and older) were 4.9, 5.0, 4.4 and 3.8. Through that same year, competitor WTQR achieved shares of 18.6, 17.5, 18.1 and 16.8. Background as 102 JAMZ On December 29, 1988, the station abandoned the country battle, flipping the format to \\"Churban\\" and changing the station's call letters and name. WJMH \\"102 JAMZ\\" was consulted by Jerry Clifton, who specialized in multi-ethnic programming (in Miami, Detroit, Orlando, Dallas, Philadelphia and other markets).http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1989/RR-1989-01-06.pdf Under original Program Director Chris Bailey, 102 JAMZ showed a 12+ Arbitron share of 7.7 in their first ratings book, as compared to rival Power 97's 4.1. Under Bailey, and 102 JAMZ' second PD Brian Douglas, 102 JAMZ continued to outrank Power 97 in the 12+ ratings, especially with Men and Women aged 18 to 34 and with teenaged listeners (Douglas joined 102 JAMZ in September, 1990 and remains Program Director at the present time). 102 JAMZ and Power 97 continued to compete head-on until September, 1996. At that time, new owner Max Media moved WQMG in a much more adult direction, as Black-targeted Urban Adult Contemporary 97.1 QMG and 102 JAMZ began working with Steve Smith Radio and Ratings Consultants (Smith had guided Hot 97 WQHT New York's transition from dance to a more Hip Hop and R&B; mix as Hot 97's Program Director in 1993 and 1994). From its inception, 102 JAMZ featured a strong percentage of Rap and, by 1992, was perhaps the first radio station to be targeted exclusively toward 18- to 24-year-old African- Americans. \\"Urban\\", or Black-targeted stations of the time, typically attempted to reach a broader demographic, concentrating focus on the lucrative 25- to 54-year-old market. Rap music was typically relegated to weekend mix shows, limited to airplay during the evenings only or, in many cases, not played at all. The station achieved success with younger listeners across the spectrum (White, Hispanic, etc.), building on music for college-aged listeners, foreground \\"personalities\\", regular hip hop-oriented Mix Shows, interactive cash contests and activity \\"on the streets\\". Breaking lifestyle news and events in hip hop music played a key role on the station from the early days, as well. 102 JAMZ reports weekly playlist information to Mediabase as a Rhythmic CHR and to BDS as an R&B;/Hip-Hop reporter. For ratings purposes, Nielsen Audio has WJMH listed as a Rhythmic in its monthly PPM books. The station's playlist is mostly focused on the Hip-Hop/Rap genre, leaving some current R&B; to Urban AC sister WQMG. On June 4, 2020, WJMH's 3 Live Crew teamed up with WKZL's Jared and Katie to discuss to the continuing conflict involving police brutality against minorities, protests, and systematic racism that has spilled over into the Greensboro-High Point- Winston-Salem Metropolitan area that began with the George Floyd protests.‚ÄúWKZL (1075 KZL) & WJMH (102 Jamz) Special Broadcast In Greensboro‚Äú from All Access Music Group (June 4, 2020) Ownership history The station which is now WJMH has been operated by five different owners through the years.

She was one of the first women war correspondents to go abroad in World War I. Biography Corra Mae White was born in Elbert County, Georgia, March 17, 1869. Her formal education was limited to teacher training at nearby female academies, though she never graduated from any of the schools she attended. In 1887 she married Methodist minister and educator Lundy Howard Harris (1858‚Äì1910). They had one child survive to adulthood, a daughter named Faith (1887‚Äì1919). For roughly two decades Harris struggled through various personal tragedies, including a troubled marriage; the death of two infant sons; scandal and humiliation surrounding the abandonment, betrayal, and return of her husband in 1898 and his public confessions of adultery; the financial destitution resulting from the loss of his teaching position at Emory College; his suicide in 1910; her daughter's death in 1919; and her sister's death shortly after that. Harris remained a widow until her death 25 years later. Harris was, for a time, the most widely known woman from the state of Georgia. Her literary reputation during her life and legacy since are connected with A Circuit Rider's Wife published in 1910. Reputedly autobiographical, the novel is at most a spiritual autobiography, with little else that resembles her actual life. She wrote more than two dozen books, nineteen of which were published. Two were autobiographies, one a travel journal, and two became feature-length movies, the best known was I'd Climb The Highest Mountain, released in 1951 and inspired by, A Circuit Rider's Wife.\\"Corra Harris,\\" IMDb. The other was the 1920 film Husbands and Wives. She published over 200 articles and short stories, and well over a thousand book reviews.

Mrs. Corra Harris, c. 1910s. Although she became famous for her fiction, Harris's reputation for reactionary conservatism lasted throughout her life and became part of her contradictory legacy.Badura, Catherine O.

Such a reputation resulted in part from her first nationally published piece in 1899. After the lynching of Thomas Wilkes, alias Sam Hose, near Newnan, Georgia, William Hayes Ward, editor-in-chief at the Independent, published an editorial denouncing the act. Harris wrote and the Independent published \\"A Southern Woman's View,\\" a reply upholding the southern practice of lynching with reasoning anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells-Barnett (Ida B. Wells) called \\"threadbare\\", namely to protect innocent white women from malevolent black men. Editors at the Independent asked Harris for more, which launched her writing career. Afterward, she wrote several non-fiction essays on southern identity that furthered conventional images of southerners during the first decade of the century. They also tied her reputation then and after to regional apologia (apologists), an image that belies the complexity of her body of work. After A Circuit Rider's Wife was published in 1910, Harris wrote and published prolifically, both fiction and non-fiction, throughout the nineteen-teens. During the 1920s, her most successful works were two autobiographies published in the middle of the decade. By the early 1930s Harris's publishing was limited largely to local areas. The last four years of her life, from 1931‚Äì1935, she published what critics have called some of her best writing in a tri-weekly \\"Candlelit Column\\" in the Atlanta Journal. Some critics have dismissed Harris's fiction as domestic or sentimental, but others find nuanced social and cultural critique in her works, especially of the South's gender and racial mores.

(May 6, 1806 in Pompey, N.Y. ‚Äì September 29, 1860 in Baltimore, Maryland) was an American physician and dentist and dentistry school founder. Education At the age of 17 Harris studied medicine in Madison, Ohio, in the office of his brother, Dr. John Harris, who also tutored him in dentistry, a subject which become his main interest. He subsequently passed the Board of Medical Censors in 1824 and was licensed to practice medicine. He soon commenced practice in Greenfield, Ohio, where he remained for about one year, travelling to Bloomfield, Ohio, then Fredericksburg, Virginia. In 1828, Dr. Harris turned to full-time dentistry, and by 1833 was a student of Dr. Horace H. Hayden located in Baltimore, Maryland. Licensed by the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland, Harris conducted an itinerant dental practice throughout the South, before settling permanently in Baltimore in 1835. Harris received the honorary M. D. degree from Washington Medical College at Baltimore, in which he was a professor in 1838. Shurtleff College in Alton, Illinois, conferred an A.M. degree on him in 1842. His D.D.S. was obtained through membership of the American Society of Dental Surgery, and an honorary D.D.S. degree was conferred upon him by the Philadelphia Dental College in 1854. Achievements Harris is considered one of the founding members of the profession of Dentistry in the United States of America, father of American dental science, and a pioneer of dental journalism. He has been inducted in the hall of fame of the Pierre Fauchard Academy. =Contribution to dental literature= As early as 1835 Harris became an active contributor to medical and periodical literature as one of the most vigorous and productive dental writers, causing him to be regarded as the founder of dental literature in the US. He was also a contributor to medical and periodical literature. * 1839: Publication of his first book, The Dental Art, a Practical Treatise on Dental Surgery. * 1845: Second edition of the above book with a new title: Principles and Practice of Dental Surgery. The book was edited 11 more times with the last edition in 1896. It was the most useful dental textbook of the 19th century. * 1840: Founder, first chief editor and publisher of the world first dental periodical, the American Journal of Dental Science. He continued as editor until his death in 1860. * 1842: Publication of Diseases of the Maxillary Sinus. * 1849: Publication of the Dictionary of Dental Surgery, Biography, Bibliography and Medical Terminology, a volume of 779 pages, the first dental dictionary in the English language, the sixth edition of which appeared in 1898. =First national dental organization= In 1840 he was the first to respond to the call of Dr. Horace H. Hayden to organize the American Society of Dental Surgeons (ASDS). At a meeting at the home of Solyman Brown BA, MA, MD, DDS, in New York, it was on his motion that the convention to organize a society \\"resolved that a National Society be formed.\\" He was its first corresponding secretary and its president in 1844. After the disruption of the society in 1856 due to the dental amalgam controversy, he was one of the foremost organizers of its successor, the American Dental Convention, serving as its president in 1856‚Äì57. In 1859, a year before his death, another national dental organization, the American Dental Association, was established during a meeting in Niagara, New York. Before 1861 dentists were participant in both dental organizations, which promoted education and research in all aspects of dentistry, including dental materials and remained active throughout the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). However, during the war, Southern dentists withdrew from them and, in 1869 established the Southern Dental Association.Publications ‚Äì History of Dentistry - Dental Filling Materials in the Confederacy The Southern Dental Association merged with the ADA in 1897 to form the National Dental Association (NDA). The NDA was renamed the American Dental Association (ADA) in 1922. =First dental college in the United States= With the assistance and advice of three other physicians, he worked tirelessly to establish the first dental school in the world. Apparently his initial attempt was to establish a dental training school attached to the Medical Department of the University of Maryland. This first attempt did not meet with success, possibly due to the opposition of Dr. H. Willis Baxley, one of the dental faculty. Undaunted, Harris persevered in his efforts, and during the winter of 1839‚Äì40, almost singlehandedly he gathered the signatures of representative citizens for a petition to the legislature of the state of Maryland for the incorporation of a College of Dental Surgery at Baltimore. Surmounting the opposition of jealous medical rivals, he successfully managed to obtain the charter and with the aid of Horace H. Hayden, Thomas E. Bond, H. Willis Baxley, S. Brown, E. Parmly and others, he organized the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery in 1840. He was the school's first dean and professor of practical dentistry. After Hayden's death in 1844, he became the school's second president. The establishment of the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery is seen as one of the three crucial steps in the foundation of the dental profession in the United States. \\" A true profession is built upon a tripod: a formal organization, formal professional education, and a formal scientific literature. The United States was the leader in all three. In 1839‚Äì40, the American Society of Dental Surgeons was organized, the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery was established, and the first dental journal in the world, the American Journal of Dental Science, was founded. At that time there were only about three hundred trained and scientific dentists in the entire country; the rest were relatively untrained operators, outright quacks, or charlatans. In 1898, a list of the first subscribers to the first journal was discovered and published by G. V. Black. These initial subscribers may be considered the core group of truly professional American dentists. They became the leaders of the newly born profession of dentistry. \\" Harris was instrumental in all three. Harris died on September 29, 1860, due mainly to overwork.

As with electric guitars, electric mandolins take many forms. Most common is a carved-top eight-string instrument fitted with an electric pickup in similar fashion to many archtop semi-acoustic guitars. Solid body mandolins are common in 4-, 5-, and 8-string forms. Acoustic electric mandolins also exist in many forms.  History  Electric mandolins were built in the United States as early as the late 1920s. Among the first companies to produce them were Stromberg-Voisinet, Electro (which later became Rickenbacker), Vivi-Tone, and National. Gibson and Vega introduced their electric mandolins in 1936. In the United States, luthier/inventor Paul Bigsby began building solid-body electric mandolins (technically, they consisted of a solid wood core housing the electronics, with hollow wings forming the body) in 1949. His first one had ten strings and was built for Al Giddings. Bigsby's most famous mandolin, built in 1952, was owned and played by Western swing musician Tiny Moore. This instrument had five single courses rather than the more common four double courses, and was patterned after a similar instrument built by Jim Harvey of La Jolla, California, for a player named Scotty Broyles. Gibson and Rickenbacker introduced solid-body eight-string mandolins in the 1950s,Rickenbacker 5002V58 while Fender followed the single- course idea with its four-string version. A related instrument, the Bahian guitar, was developed in Brazil beginning in the 1940s. Bahian guitars typically have a solid body and four or five strings tuned in fifths, but are considered to be electric versions of the cavaquinho rather than the mandolin which is why it's sometimes called electric cavaquinho (or cavaquinho el√©trico). Solid-body electric mandolins Epiphone's Mandobird solid body electric mandolin Both four-string single-course and eight-string double- course solid body mandolins have been produced by several makers, as well as five-string models combining the tonal ranges of the mandola and mandolin. From 1956 to 1976, Fender produced a four-string version, the Fender Electric Mandolin with a body shape was based loosely on the Stratocaster, popularly nicknamed the \\"Mandocaster\\". In 2013, Fender reissued it as the Mando-Strat in both four- and eight-string models. Gibson manufactured the EM-200 solid-body electric mandolin from 1954 to 1971. They recently produced a solid-body mandolin known as the Mandobird, based on the Gibson Firebird body and sold under the Epiphone label, in both four- and eight-string versions. Eastwood Guitars manufactures a solid-body eight-string electric mandolin as the \\"Mandocaster\\" with a Telecaster-style body and two single-coil pickups, as well as a four-string Mandostang as part of their line of Warren Ellis- endorsed instuments. Players While the electric mandolin has increased in popularity along with its acoustic cousin, there are still relatively few recordings featuring it as a lead instrument on more than a song or two.

It dominates Piazza Maggiore. The basilica is dedicated to the patron saint of the city, Saint Petronius, who was the bishop of Bologna in the fifth century. Construction began in 1390 and its main facade has remained unfinished since. The building was transferred from the city to the diocese in 1929; the basilica was finally consecrated in 1954. It has been the seat of the relics of Bologna's patron saint only since 2000; until then they were preserved in the Santo Stefano church of Bologna. History = Construction = The Porta Magna with sculpture by Jacopo della Quercia In 1388, the Consiglio Generale dei Seicento prepared the construction of the church as a civic temple. To make room for the church, the adjacent Curia of Sancti Ambrosii was demolished, together with the majority of one of the city's burgs, including at least eight churches and towers. The first stone of construction was laid on 7 June 1390 under the supervision of architect Antonio di Vincenzo. Works lasted for several centuries: after the completion of the first version of the facade, in 1393 the first pair of side chapels were begun. The series were completed only in 1479. The third bay was built in 1441‚Äì1446. Its construction was delayed by the cardinal Baldassarre Cossa, who sold the construction material of the basilica and kept the money. San Petronio Basilica and Piazza Maggiore. In 1514, Arduino degli Arriguzzi was chosen as the architect to construct the dome. His proposal included a large dome resting upon the width between the side aisles, which necessitated larger transepts and apses. This led to a form of a Latin cross, which was said to outdo St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The project was considered too complicated, and after building the first two pillars and two triangular pylons for the dome, the work was halted. According to legend, Pope Pius IV halted the \\"megalomaniac dream\\" and instead encouraged the construction of the Archiginnasio of Bologna. Architecture = Exterior = The basilica is a large church measuring 132 metres long, 66 metres wide, and 47 metres tall, and is described as the \\"most imposing\\" church in Bologna. The fa√ßade was designed by Domenico da Varignana and started in 1538 by Giacomo Ranuzzi. However, it remains unfinished. The main doorway (Porta Magna) was decorated by Jacopo della Quercia of Siena with scenes from the Old Testament on the pillars, eighteen prophets on the archivolt, scenes from the New Testament on the architrave, and a Madonna and Child, Saint Ambrose and Saint Petronius on the tympanum. It is flanked by two side doors, with Alfonso Lombardi's Resurrection on the left and Amico Aspertini's Deposition on the right. The central nave covering and apse shooting were completed in 1663, designed by Girolamo Rainaldi and directed by Francesco Martini. The lower naves are enclosed by rectilinear walls. The first two windows were designed by Antonio with the assistance of Francesco di Simone, Domenico da Milano, Pagno di Lapo Portigiani and Antonio di Simone. The bell tower was designed by Giovanni da Brensa and built between 1481 and 1487. In 2017, the proposal for completing the facade by Inter-Esse Studio was awarded the first place in the international competition of wall was held by CODE - Competitions for Designers and Con-fine Art.

Music Bologna was a principal centre of Baroque music in Italy. The musical organisation had been officially instituted by Pope Eugenius IV in 1436; the first regularly paid instrumentalists were added in the late sixteenth century, and in the seventeenth century San Petronio was renowned for its sacred instrumental and choral music, with its two great organs, completed in 1476 and 1596, both still in remarkably original condition; the library remains a rich archival repository. Three successive maestri di cappella marked the great age of music at San Petronio: Maurizio Cazzati (1657‚Äì71), Giovanni Paolo Colonna (1674‚Äì95) and Giacomo Antonio Perti (1696‚Äì1756).Anne Schnoebelen, \\"Performance Practices at San Petronio in the Baroque\\" Acta Musicologica 41.1/2 (January 1969), pp. 37-55; see also Eugene Enrico, The Orchestra at San Petronio in the Baroque Era (Washington: Smithsonian Studies) 1976. The current maestro, since 1996, is the harpsichordist Sergio Vartolo who has revitalised the cappella with a series of recordings for Naxos, Tactus, Brilliant Classics and Bongiovanni. Cassini's Meridian Line The winter solstice end of the meridian line The church hosts also a marking in the form of a meridian line inlaid in the paving of the left aisle in 1655; it was calculated and designed by the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who was teaching astronomy at the University. A meridian line does not indicate the time: instead, with its length of it is one of the largest astronomical instruments in the world, allowing measurements that were for the time uniquely precise. The sun light, entering through a hole placed at a height in the church wall, projects an elliptical image of the sun, which at local noon falls exactly on the meridian line and every day is different as to position and size. The position of the projected image along the line allows to determine accurately the daily altitude of the sun at noon, from which Cassini was able to calculate with unprecedented precision astronomical parameters such as the obliquity of the ecliptic, the duration of the tropical year and the timing of equinoxes and solstices. On the other hand, the size of the projected sun's image, and in particular its rate of variation during the year, allowed Cassini the first experimental verification of Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Cassini and Domenico Guglielmini published an illustrated account of how the meridian line was accomplished in 1695.Recently, the book was edited by Giordano Berti and Giovanni Paltrinieri, La Meridiana del Tempio di S. Petronio in Bologna, Arnaldo Forni Editore, S. Giovanni in Persiceto, 2000. Paltrinieri is also the author of a booklet that summarises the work of Cassini and Guglielmini; La meridiana di San Petronio Modern terrorist attacks Late gothic fresco in San Petronio Basilica, depicting Mohammed being tortured in Hell. In 2002, five men who it was believed were connected to Al Qaeda and were planning to blow up the building, were arrested. Again in 2006, plans by Muslim terrorists to destroy the Basilica were thwarted by Italian police. The terrorists claimed that a 15th-century fresco inside was insulting to Islam. The fresco, painted by Giovanni da Modena, depicts Muhammad in Hell being devoured by demons.News article See also *Bolognese bell ringing art, which was conceived and created in the Basilica's bell tower *Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri, whose meridian line Pope Clement XI commissioned to rival Bologna's *Palazzo dei Banchi *Palazzo d'Accursio *Palazzo del Podest√†, Bologna *Palazzo dei Notai Notes Sources * External links *Bologna racconta (in Italian) *Relief Sculpture, Main Portal, San Petronio *High- resolution viewers for Giovanni da Modena's Living Cross and Verdant Cross by Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation Roman Catholic churches completed in 1479 15th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Petronio 1390 establishments in Europe 14th-century establishments in Italy Unfinished buildings and structures Gothic architecture in Bologna Burial sites of the House of Bonaparte Monuments and historic places of Bologna Cultural depictions of Muhammad Buildings containing meridian lines ","title":"San Petronio, Bologna"},{"id":"2847968","text":"An example of a picture taken by Disneyland's Splash Mountain camera An on- ride camera is a camera mounted alongside the track of a roller coaster, log flume or other thrill ride that automatically photographs all of the riders on each passing vehicle. They are often mounted at the most intense or fastest part of the ride, resulting in humorously distorted expressions due to fear or wind resistance. The pictures are then available for viewing and purchase as a souvenir. Upon exiting the ride, park guests pass a booth or shop where their vehicle's pictures are on display screens. Depending on the size of the vehicle used by the attraction, the entire car or groups of one, two, or four may comprise one photograph. The display images are numbered, and customers wishing to purchase a photo take the appropriate number to a cashier. This photo shop may be located in the same building as the displays or in a separate shop nearby. Many parks offer minimal editing tools (such as red-eye effect removal) before purchase. The photo is usually ready within minutes of purchase. Single prints in varying sizes are available, provided in cardboard folio bearing the name of the park or ride. Often specialty products, such as posters, keychains or t-shirts, are available also. An unusual camera configuration can be found on the hydraulically launched roller coasters Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point and Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure. Both had two cameras (Kingda Ka's second on-ride camera has since been removed), one during the high-speed launch segment and another at the final brake run, providing riders with a before and after picture of themselves on those harrowing rides. Another unusual configuration is Hydra the Revenge at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom. The ride features two cameras, one takes your picture before a loop and the other takes a picture while the rider is upside- down. Hydra the Revenge is also the only roller coaster to take a picture while the rider is upside down. Video Hydra the Revenge at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pennsylvania A relatively new trend in the industry is on-ride video cameras. On some rides, on-ride videos are recorded by cameras mounted alongside the track, similar to on-ride photo cameras. This provides a third person montage-style of cuts which show the train entering, passing through and then leaving the frame. One such ride using this system is SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit at Universal Studios Florida. Using the alternate system, videos are recorded by cameras mounted inside the ride vehicles, usually on the back of the seat in front of the subject. This provides a first-person stream of consciousness-style film, showing the riders' emotions close up from start to finish. Some coasters that use this system are Thunderhawk at Michigan's Adventure, Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit at Universal Studios Florida, and Verbolten at Busch Gardens Williamsburg. Volcano, The Blast Coaster at Kings Dominion, FireWhip at Beto Carrero World utilizes this style; a method also previously used by Saw: The Ride and The Swarm at Thorpe Park which no longer offer the service, with the camera mounted to the seat backs.

After the war, she was sold into merchant service as the MV Breconshire, serving for over 20 years until scrapped in 1967. History =Royal Navy= HMS Activity was built at Caledon shipyards in Dundee. When construction started in 1940 she was intended to become the refrigerated cargo ship Telemachus for the Alfred Holt Line. In February 1941, she was taken over by the Ministry of War Transport and renamed Empire Activity. In January 1942, she was requisitioned by the Admiralty for conversion to an escort carrier, now named HMS Activity and carrying pennant number D94. Following her launch in May 1942 and completion in August of that year, Activity worked up at Lamlash before going to Rosyth for rectification of defects. Entering service on 1 January 1943, Activity operated as a deck landing training carrier until October 1943, when she was sent to Liverpool for a refit before entering active service. After her refit, Activity took part in convoy escort duties in the North Atlantic. Activity embarked 819 Naval Air Squadron on 12 January 1944, and began escort duties on 29 January as part of the Second Escort Group. Activity was involved in the escort of convoys OS 66, KMS 40, ON 222, NS 28, SL 147, MKS 38, HX 277, KMS 43 and MKF 29 in the period to March 1944. Following this, Activity moved to the Arctic, escorting convoy JW 58 to Murmansk. Her aircraft‚Äîtogether with those from ‚Äîwere responsible for the sinking of U-boat , and , as well as damaging , and . The return convoy‚ÄîRA 58‚Äîreached its destination without loss. In May 1944, Activity spent some time at a shipyard on the Clyde for defect rectification before rejoining the Second Escort Group for escort duties. Activity escorted convoys OS 78, KMS 52, SL 158, MKS 49, OS 78, KMS 52, AL 159, MKS 50, SL 162, MK 53, KMF 33, MKF 33, OS 86, KMS 60, SL 167 and MKS 58. In August 1944, Activity was designated as a ferry carrier. She transported aircraft, personnel and supplies to Trincomalee, Ceylon, arriving on 23 October 1944 and returning via Gibraltar, where she joined convoy MKF 36 back to the United Kingdom. Activity spent some time in a Clyde shipyard in December 1944 for defect rectification, after which she was reallocated to the East Indies Fleet and given a new pennant number, R301. She sailed with convoy KM 39 on 29 January 1945, arriving in Colombo on 20 February. Whilst en route to Sydney, Activity rescued the 92 survivors from , an American liberty ship which had been sunk by on 6 February 1945, the last Allied ship sunk by enemy action in the Indian Ocean. Survivors from Peter Silvester were landed at Fremantle and Activity then continued her journey to Sydney. Activity departed Sydney on 24 March, bound for Colombo for duty ferrying aircraft from Cochin to Colombo. After the end of the war, Activity was sent to Singapore to support the reoccupation of Singapore. She loaded ex-POWs and other passengers and sailed for Trincomalee on 15 September. Activity arrived home on the Clyde on 20 October 1945, and was then de-stored and placed in the Reserve Fleet. She was placed in the Category B Reserve on 30 January 1946, and sold to Glen Lines on 25 March 1946 for conversion to a merchant ship. =Merchant Navy= Activity was converted to a Glenearn class merchant ship by Palmers of Hebburn-on-Tyne, and renamed Breconshire, entering service with Glen Line in September 1947. She was the second Glen Line ship to be named Breconshire. She measured 9,061 gross register tons. She remained in service until April 1967, sailing from Kobe to Mihara for scrapping, arriving there on 24 April 1967.

However, his first season ended with two cup final runners-up medals; he was a substitute in the 1973 FA Cup Final, which Leeds lost 1‚Äì0 to Sunderland, and also appeared in the 1973 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, which Leeds lost in controversial circumstances to AC Milan. Yorath finally won some silverware the following 1973‚Äì74 season, where he was a key member of the Leeds championship winning side. Yorath became the first Welshman to play in a European Cup final when Leeds reached the final of the UEFA European Cup, but again Yorath ended up with a runners up medal as Leeds lost 2‚Äì0 to Bayern Munich in controversial circumstances. Don Revie had left Leeds to manage England, and his eventual replacement Jimmy Armfield decided to dispense with Yorath's services in 1976, selling him to Coventry City for ¬£125,000. During his time with Leeds, Yorath made 120 appearances and scored ten goals. =Coventry City= Yorath would be captain to one of only a handful of top flight Coventry City sides that spent an entire season in the top ten. Spearheaded by the prolific strike partnership of Ian Wallace and Mick Ferguson, and ably abetted by the legendary winger Tommy Hutchison and attacking full backs Graham Oakey and Bobby MacDonald, the Sky Blues would enjoy a 7th-place finish in the 1977‚Äì78 season, narrowly missing out on European football. Yorath's Coventry side containing such notables as Alan Green, McDonald and Mick Coop are still fondly remembered even today by the Sky Blue faithful. A remarkable 5‚Äì4 win over Norwich City at Highfield Road, Christmas 1977, replete with bicycle kick by Ian Wallace and last gasp penalty save by Jim Blyth, lives long in Coventry folklore. Yorath remained at Coventry for three years, playing 99 games and scoring three goals and was captain for most of this period. He moved onto Tottenham Hotspur in 1979 for ¬£300,000, and then briefly to Vancouver Whitecaps in 1981, where he made 59 appearances, scoring four goals in his two seasons with the club. International career Yorath picked up the first of 59 Welsh caps in 1970 against Italy, and he maintained a regular presence in the international side until 1981. Yorath also captained his country on 42 occasions. Managerial career In 1982, Yorath joined Bradford City as player/assistant coach. He was injured during the Bradford City stadium fire disaster in 1985 when he was forced to jump out of a window after evacuating supporters from a bar. He subsequently took up the manager's position at Swansea City in 1986 (making a single and final league appearance), and led the club to promotion from the Division Four to the Division Three at the end of the 1987‚Äì88 season. In 1989, he was appointed part-time manager of Wales, eventually taking up the post on a full-time basis whilst still managing Swansea. However, this caused conflict with the club, and Yorath left Swansea to manage Bradford. He was dismissed by Bradford after just one year in charge, and returned to manage Swansea again. In 1991, after a run of nine consecutive defeats, he left Swansea for a second time to concentrate on managing Wales. Yorath was popular amongst the Wales players and fans and guided them to wins over Brazil in 1990 and World Cup holders Germany in a European Championship Qualifier in 1991. Under Yorath, Wales attained what was then their highest ever FIFA ranking of 27th in August 1993 and came close to qualifying for the 1994 World Cup tournament. The qualifying group started disastrously with a 5‚Äì1 defeat away to Romania. However, Yorath turned things around with victories over the Faroe Isles, Belgium and Cyprus. Needing to win their final game of the qualifying group at home to Romania, Paul Bodin's penalty hit the crossbar with the scores level at 1‚Äì1. Romania went on to win 2‚Äì1. Following the failure to qualify Yorath's contract as manager was not renewed, angering many Welsh fans and John Toshack, then manager of Real Sociedad, was appointed as a part-time manager. However, Toshack resigned after just one game ‚Äì a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Norway with the team being booed off the pitch in Cardiff by the Welsh fans still upset at the dismissal of Yorath. Yorath joined Cardiff City as General Manager in 1994, after speculation that he would become manager of Middlesbrough in May that year, and assumed control of team affairs in November of that year when manager Eddie May was sacked. However, his time in the hotseat with the Bluebirds was brief, and he was sacked in March 1995 with the club headed for relegation. In April of the same year, Yorath took over as coach of the Lebanon national team, and helped them rise 60 places in the FIFA World Rankings before leaving in 1997. Between 1997 and 2000 he worked as a coach at Huddersfield Town and Bradford City, before joining Sheffield Wednesday as assistant to Paul Jewell. Yorath retained his position when Jewell was dismissed, and eventually became manager in 2001. However, he resigned in 2002 after a run of five defeats in six league matches saw Wednesday drop into the relegation zone. In June 2008, Yorath returned to football when he was appointed the director of football at Isthmian League Premier Division side Margate, where his brother Dai and nephew Dean had both played. On 21 November 2008, he was appointed manager of the club after Barry Ashby was sacked. However, Yorath resigned as Margate manager on 24 September 2009 following a run of disappointing results, leaving Neville Southall in temporary charge of the team. Personal life Terry is the father of four children, including Gabby, the television broadcaster. He has three grandchildren, two born to Gabby and the other to son Jordan. His son Daniel collapsed and died on 25 May 1992 in his garden, at the age of 15, as a result of an undetected heart condition just before he was due to begin a footballing career with Leeds United. In 2004, Yorath was arrested after a car accident and charged with drunk driving. Yorath knocked down 27-year-old call centre worker Raziya Aslam breaking her pelvis. Yorath pleaded guilty to all charges and received a 30-month driving ban and 60 hours' community service. The trial judge had been seriously considering a prison sentence for Yorath, but his defence advised that there was a risk that Yorath would take his own life if sent to prison. Yorath maintains that he would not have taken his own life if he had been jailed. His autobiography, published in 2004, is titled Hard Man, Hard Knocks.http://www.lufctalk.com/resources/leeds-united-books/hard-man-hard- knocks-267.html Honours =Manager= Lebanon * Pan Arab Games third place: 1997 References Further reading External links Profile on NASL Jerseys 1950 births Living people People from Grangetown, Cardiff Footballers from Cardiff Welsh footballers Association football midfielders Leeds United F.C. players Coventry City F.C. players Tottenham Hotspur F.C. players Vancouver Whitecaps (1974‚Äì1984) players Bradford City A.F.C. players Swansea City A.F.C. players English Football League players North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) players North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) indoor players Wales under-23 international footballers Wales international footballers Welsh expatriate footballers Welsh expatriate sportspeople in Canada Expatriate soccer players in Canada Welsh football managers Bradford City A.F.C. non-playing staff Swansea City A.F.C. managers Wales national football team managers Bradford City A.F.C. managers Cardiff City F.C. managers Lebanon national football team managers Huddersfield Town A.F.C. non-playing staff Sheffield Wednesday F.C. managers English Football League managers Isthmian League managers Welsh expatriate football managers Welsh expatriate sportspeople in Lebanon Expatriate football managers in Lebanon ","title":"Terry Yorath"},{"id":"2848011","text":"Mario Luis Rodr√≠guez Cobos,En los sitios del grupo, aparece frecuentemente con el nombre ¬´Mario Luis Rodr√≠guez Cobos¬ª, aunque en su DNI (documento de identidad argentino) aparece como ¬´Mario Luis Rodr√≠guez¬ª, ya que en Argentina no se utiliza el apellido materno. also known by the mononym Silo (6 January 1938 ‚Äì 16 September 2010Muri√≥ Silo, el fundador del movimiento humanista, Clar√≠n.com, peri√≥dico digital de Argentina.), was an Argentine writer and founder of the Humanist Movement. An active speaker, he wrote books, short stories, articles and studies related to politics, society, psychology, spirituality and other topics. Although he described himself simply as a writer, many see him as a thinker,No s√≥lo sus lectores perciben su enorme talla intelectual y humana, sino mucha gente que lo conoci√≥ en su faceta cotidiana: v√©ase Carta del heladero de Chacras de Coria y tambi√©n Un homenaje p√≥stumo de Silo a las tortitas de Nico . based on the diversity of issues about which he has written.  Biography  Silo was born into a middle-class family of Spanish origin in Mendoza, Argentina. His father was winemaker Rafael Rodriguez and his mother Maria Luisa Cobos, a Basque, and a music teacher. He was the youngest of three children, with siblings Raquel and Guillermo. He undertook primary and secondary education with the Maristas Brotherhood achieving excellent grades, while practising gymnastics and specializing in the pommel horse and reaching high positions in the regional rankings. In addition he was involved in various youth organizations and lead a very active social and intellectual life. He carried out special studies, in languages including French and Italian, and philosophy. He also published articles in cultural magazines. Silo studied law for three years at the University of Buenos Aires and later, when they opened the Faculty of Political Science in Mendoza, he returned to his home town to continue his studies in this field. At university he began to organize research groups on human beings and their existential and social problems. Silo travelled around Argentina, South America and Europe and undertook various jobs. By 1960 - following \\"a rearrangement of his inner truths\\" as a newspaper slogan of the time reported - he began to present his proposals, while still forming study groups in Argentina and Chile. With members of these groups he organized a public talk, which was initially banned by the military government but later was permitted in the mountains, away from the centres of population. The military dictatorships which subsequently beset the country were present throughout the life of Silo with successive arrests and detentions. So, on 4 May 1969, Silo spoke to some two hundred people gathered in Punta de Vacas (Province of Mendoza), in the high Andes mountains near Mount Aconcagua, and gave his first public exposition of the ideas, that in time, would form the basis of the Humanist Movement. In this talk, known as ¬´The Healing of Suffering¬ª, he explained themes such as the overcoming of pain and suffering, the meaning of life, violence, desire and pleasure. Silo married Ana Luisa Cremaschi, whom he knew from his youth, and had two sons, Alejandro and Federico, with whom he lived in his hometown. In 1972 he published The Inner Look and the initial groups extended to other countries, partly because the military dictatorships provoked the exile of many of the participants. In the early 70's, Silo created the current of thought now known as New Humanism or Universalist Humanism,La definici√≥n de humanismo universalista est√° desarrollada por Salvatore Puledda en el texto Interpretaciones del humanismo, incluido en ¬´Un humanista contempor√°neo¬ª , p√°gs. 57-60. and founded the Humanist Movement an organized group that sought to translate this thought into practice. It can be said that this thinking encompasses the whole of human existence, not only social but also personal. Since the eighties, and under his orientation, the Humanist Movement began a period of expansion in the world with the creation of organisms and fronts of action: the Humanist Party with a presence in more than 30 countries, The Community for Human Development (a cultural association), Convergence of Cultures (a civil association), World Without Wars (an anti-armament association) and the World Centre of Humanist Studies. During 1981 he was invited to express his proposals in various public rallies in European and Asian cities, visiting Madrid, Rome, Barcelona, and later Mumbai (India) and Colombo (Sri Lanka), before returning to Paris, and later San Francisco (California) and Mexico City. He explained with particular force the position of nonviolence, manifested in the overcoming of suffering, the human treatment of others and the attitude of not searching for those to blame. Aspects of these talks relevant to his thought were published in the book ‚ÄúSilo Speaks‚Äù. On 6 October 1993 in Moscow Silo was awarded a doctorate honoris causa by the Institute of Latin American Studies of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union.Sobre este doctorado honoris causa, v√©ase: 1) El humanismo en el umbral del milenio: idea, juicio, perspectiva (documentos conferencia internacional).

In this ceremony, he supported his ideas on ¬´conditions of dialogue¬ª,El texto completo de esta conferencia se puede ver en Habla Silo , p√°ginas 114-118. concluding his presentation with these words: ¬´We will see no full dialogue on the fundamental questions of today‚Äôs civilization until we, as a society, begin to lose our belief in the innumerable illusions fed by the enticements of the current system. In the meantime, the dialogue will continue to be insubstantial and without any connection to the profound motivations of society. However, in some latitudes of the world something new has begun to move, something that, beginning in a dialogue of specialists, will slowly begin to move into the public arena.¬ª. = Later years = In early 2002, Silo announced his retirement from the Humanist Movement, after being its driving force for 32 years. He did it by moving the orientation of the Humanist Movement to an assembly composed of the general coordinators of the movement. By August 2007 there were about 400 members in this assembly. In mid-2002 he launched Silo's Message understood as a book, an experience and a path.V√©ase una presentaci√≥n oficial del mensaje en la p√°gina web de Silo . Among his more recent projects he gave impetus to the construction of complexes known as Parks of Study and Reflection in Argentina, Chile, Spain, USA, Italy, India and Egypt, among other geographical locations.V√©ase, como un ejemplo, la p√°gina oficial del Parque Punta de Vacas The money to build these parks was gathered from voluntary donations. During the first decade of the 21st century he returned to speak at Punta de Vacas on several occasions with proposals of reconciliation, access to the profound and the sacred of human being, accepting invitations to speak about his Message and going to more humble places, like family homes, or small halls (salitas) in the same neighbourhood of Mendoza, and in greater Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile and Quito (Ecuador). He also attended events organized in Lisbon, Rome, northern Italy and elsewhere. Furthermore, as well as organising Halls of the Message and Parks of Study and Reflection around his works, Silo attended various opening ceremonies in places such as in La Reja (Buenos Aires), Las Manantiales (Santiago de Chile), Carcara√±√° (Rosario, Argentina), Toledo (Spain), Attigliano (Rome, Italy), etc. One of his last public addresses was made in Berlin at the Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, on 11 November 2009, during the passage through that city of the \\"World March for Peace and Nonviolence\\". On this occasion Silo called for global nuclear disarmament as the main urgency of the moment. (resumen de la intervenci√≥n de Silo en Berl√≠n. V√≠deo de 4 minutos, de alta calidad). His last years were spent in Chacras de Coria, a town on the outskirts of the city of Mendoza. He died at his home on 16 September 2010, after suffering for more than a year with renal disease.Fallece Silo, impulsor del Movimiento Humanista en Argentina, La Tercera His figure, until his death, was highly controversial, since he was considered a ¬´spiritual guide¬ª by his followers, while his critics call him messianic leader (see Critics section below). He referred to himself as a writer and practitioner of what he called an ¬´inner religion¬ª.V√©ase la entrada \\"religiosidad\\" del Diccionario del Nuevo Humanismo en Diccionario o la conferencia \\"La religiosidad en el mundo actual\\", en Conferencias , v√≠nculos ambos de la p√°gina oficial de Silo There exist few interviews and reports in the media on the life of Silo, however, the most numerous were carried out in Chile in the early nineties (with the return to democracy) from the major talk shows on television. (entrevista a Silo en la televisi√≥n chilena) Some institutions showed recognition of his career in the days after his death, such as the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica.V√©ase: 93N-88.pdf Acta n¬∫ 88 de 7 de ocubre de 2010 - Secci√≥n plenaria de la Asamblea Legislativa de la Republica de Costa Rica, pag. 20: Outline of his thought =On psychology= The concept of the intentionality of the consciousness, which had been taken up by Franz Brentano from medieval scholasticism and developed by Edmund Husserl in Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy, takes central importance in the thought of Silo. In it he made a differentiation between sensation, perception and imagination: Rejecting ideas of the unconscious and subconscious as epochal myths based on scientific premises which are incorrectly formulated, it focuses on the study of the co-presence, impulses, levels of consciousness, centres of response, etc., as part of the psychism and the functioning of consciousness. What is new in Silo's thinking is the definition of the space of representation: =On the conception of the human being= Silo differentiates himself further from the academic ambits with a conception of the human being which led to the formation of the Humanist Movement. In fact, the definition of humanist movement as the group of people who study and interpret the needs of human beings and provide the conditions for advancing from the field of determinism to the field of freedom, i.e. to overcome pain and suffering, both individually and socially, is implied in the idea of human beings: =On spirituality= Silo explains his thoughts about spirituality in these terms:  Published books  * 1979: The Inner Look. * 1981: The Internal Landscape. * 1989: Humanize the Earth (consisting of the Inner Look, the Internal Landscape and the Human Landscape). * 1989: Guided Experiences. * 1991: Contributions to Thought. * 1991: Universal Root Myths. * 1993: Letters to my Friends. * 1993: The Day of the Winged Lion. * 1996: Dictionary of New Humanism. * 1996: Silo Speaks. * 1998: Collected Works - Volume I. * 2002: Collected Works - Volume II. * 2006: Notes on Psychology (collection of conferences, 1975, 1976, 1978 and 2006). * 2008: Silo's Message.

According to Siloists this campaign was a reaction to the growing influence of Silo with the young and the proposal of a new left humanist, non-Marxist, ideology. The notoriety of his influence was reflected in obituaries in the newspapers P√°gina/12 in ArgentinaP√°gina 12, peri√≥dico argentino and El Pa√≠s in Spain. The latter refers to Silo as the ¬´founder of a philosophy that came to gather a million followers in over 100 countries¬ª and ¬´a strange character for the West, one who could have been born in the East.

He is member of The Film-Makers' Cooperative, founded by Jonas Mekas, Shirley Clarke, Ken Jacobs, Andy Warhol, and Jack Smith among others. His first finished feature-length movie is FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions, which he released in 2004. The movie won the Best Feature Film Award at the Athens Panorama of Independent Filmmakers in 2005 and was also nominated for the M√©li√®s d'Argent at Fantasporto that same year.  Reception  Critics often express the difficulty of valuing Atanes' cinematography and sometimes they even refrain from scoring it, since these are unusual films that escape the standard classification. Dave J. Wilson from Cinematic Shocks says regarding Maximum Shame ‚Äúit exists outside of the cinematic norm not following its conventions (‚Ä¶) it is purely visual art rather than a real narrative a dreamlike mind-fuck of philosophical musings. It is not a question of whether it is good or not as it does not conform to cinematic conventions. Therefore, I will not be giving a rating for this review, as it is hard for me to judge it on such terms. Whether you like the film or not you will ultimately more likely all reach the same conclusion that it is at least a unique work.‚Äù Film Threat, meanwhile, says that within Gallino, the Chicken System ‚Äúis an entire universe of creativity, albeit one that may or may not reflect this plane of reality as we know it.

Alexander in Athens Antipater, on his death in 319 BC, had left the regency to Polyperchon, to the exclusion and consequent discontent of his own son, Cassander. Those who had been placed in authority by Antipater in the garrisoned towns of Greece, were favourably disposed to Cassander, as their patron's son, and Polyperchon's policy, therefore, was to reverse the measures of Antipater, and restore democracy where Antipater had abolished it. To implement this plan Polyperchon's son, Alexander, was sent to Athens during 318, with the aim of delivering the city from Nicanor, who had been appointed by Cassander to command the garrison placed in Munychia by Antipater. Before Alexander's arrival, Nicanor strengthening his position in Munychia with fresh troops and had also treacherously seized Piraeus. Alexander had the same intentions, intentions which he had probably formed before he had any communication with Phocion, though Diodorus seems to imply the contrary. The Athenians, however, looked on Phocion as the author of the design, and their suspicions and anger were further excited by the private conferences between Alexander and Nicanor. As a result, Phocion was accused of treason, and, fleeing with several of his friends to Alexander, was despatched by Alexander to Polyperchon. Cassander arrived in Athens soon after and occupied Piraeus. There he was besieged by Polyperchon with a large force. However, Polyperchon's forces lacked adequate supplies, so he was obliged to withdraw a portion of his army. Polyperchon used this army to attempt the reduction of Megalopolis, while Alexander was left in command of the remaining forces in Athens. However, it appears he achieved little, until the treaty and capitulation of Athens to Cassander. Alexander in the Peloponnese When Polyperchon, baffled at Megalopolis, withdrew into Macedonia, his son seems to have been left with an army in the Peloponnese, where, according to Diodorus the field was left open to him. The friends of oligarchy were greatly alarmed by the departure of Cassander to Macedonia following the murder of Philip Arrhidaeus and Eurydice by Olympias during 317. During Cassander's absence, Alexander succeeded captured several cities and important places in the Peloponnese. However, on Cassander's return to the south, after crushing Olympias in Macedonia, Alexander attempted in vain to check Cassander by his fortification of the Isthmus of Corinth. Instead Cassander, passed to Epidaurus by sea, regained Argos and Hermione, and afterwards also the Messenian towns, with the exception of Ithome. Alliances with Antigonus and then Cassander In the next year, 315 BC, Antigonus (whose ambition and successes in the east had united Cassander, Lysimachus, Asander, and Ptolemy against him), sent Aristodemus into the Peloponnese to form an alliance with Polyperchon and Alexander. Alexander was persuaded by Aristodemus to travel to Asia for a personal conference with Antigonus. Finding Antigonus in Tyre, a treaty was made between them, and Alexander returned to Greece with a present of 500 talents from Antigonus, and a multitude of magnificent promises. Yet, in the very same year, Alexander renounced his alliance with Antigonus and was bribed with the title of governor of the Peloponnese to reconcile himself to Cassander. Alexander's death In the ensuing year, 314 BC, Alexander engaged in the siege of Cyllene on behalf of Cassander. However, this siege was raised by Aristodemus and his Aetolian allies. After the return of Aristodemus to Aetolia, the citizens of Dyme, in Achaia, besieged the citadel, which was occupied by one of Cassander's garrisons. Alexander forced his way into the city and made himself master of it, punishing the opposing inhabitants with death, imprisonment, or exile. Very soon after this he was murdered at Sicyon by Alexion, a Sicyonian, leaving the command of his forces to his wife Cratesipolis who proved herself fully adequate to the task.

It uses disks impregnated with a reagent such as N,N,N‚Ä≤,N‚Ä≤-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) or N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DMPD), which is also a redox indicator. The reagent is a dark-blue to maroon color when oxidized, and colorless when reduced. Oxidase-positive bacteria possess cytochrome oxidase or indophenol oxidase (an iron-containing hemoprotein).. Isenberg HD, editor. Clinical Microbiology Procedures Handbook. American Society for Microbiology; 2004. p. 3.3.2-3.3.2.13 These both catalyze the transport of electrons from donor compounds (NADH) to electron acceptors (usually oxygen). The test reagent, TMPD dihydrochloride acts as an artificial electron donor for the enzyme oxidase. The oxidized reagent forms the colored compound indophenol blue. The cytochrome system is usually only present in aerobic organisms that are capable of using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. The end-product of this metabolism is either water or hydrogen peroxide (broken down by catalase).MacFaddin JF, editor. Biochemical Tests for Identification of Medical Bacteria. 3rd ed. Philadelphia:Lippincott Williams and Wilkins; 2000. p. 363-7 Classification Strains may be either oxidase-positive (OX+) or oxidase-negative (OX-). =OX+= OX+ normally means the bacterium contains cytochrome c oxidase (aka. Complex IV) and can therefore use oxygen for energy production by converting O2 to H2O2 or H2O with an electron transfer chain. The Pseudomonadaceae are typically OX+ The Gram-negative diplococci Neisseria and Moraxella are oxidase-positive. Many Gram-negative, spiral curved rods are also oxidase-positive, which includes Helicobacter pylori, Vibrio cholerae, and Campylobacter jejuni. Oxidase Variable Legionella pneumophila may be oxidase-positive . =OX‚àí= OX‚àí normally means the bacterium does not contain cytochrome c oxidase and, therefore, either cannot use oxygen for energy production with an electron transfer chain or employs a different cytochrome for transferring electrons to oxygen. Enterobacteriaceae are typically OX‚àí.  Procedures  #Wet each disk with about four inoculating loops of deionized water. #Use a loop to aseptically transfer a large mass of pure bacteria to the disk. #Observe the disk for up to three minutes. If the area of inoculation turns dark-blue to maroon to almost black, then the result is positive. If a color change does not occur within three minutes, the result is negative. In alternative manner, live bacteria cultivated on trypticase soy agar plates may be prepared using sterile technique with a single-line streak inoculation. The inoculated plates are incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 24‚Äì48 hours to establish colonies. Fresh bacterial preparations should be used. After colonies have grown on the medium, 2-3 drops of the reagent DMPD are added to the surface of each organism to be tested. * A positive test (OX+) will result in a color change violet to purple, within 10‚Äì30 seconds. * A negative test (OX-) will result in a light-pink or absence of coloration.

A left-arm orthodox spinner and powerful middle-order batsman, he played for England at One Day International (ODI) and Test level, and most recently played county cricket for Warwickshire in the second half of the 2012 season. He was born at Chesterfield in Derbyshire. Domestic career =Somerset County Cricket Club= Blackwell started off his career at Derbyshire, before moving to Somerset in 2000 following a dispute with Derbyshire captain Dominic Cork. He was appointed captain of Somerset for the last part of the 2005 season after the departure of Graeme Smith. Having been appointed official captain for 2006, he had shoulder surgery and missed almost all of the season. =Durham County Cricket Club= After the 2008 season, Blackwell left Somerset and joined Durham. Blackwell's struggles with fitness and disagreements with the captain, Justin Langer, were also factors in his departure from Somerset. Blackwell managed to lose over the winter. On his first-class debut for Durham, in the opening match of the 2009 English season, Blackwell scored a century against the Marylebone Cricket Club, featuring a bowling line up including England hopefuls Sajid Mahmood, Kabir Ali, Tim Bresnan, and Adil Rashid. =Warwickshire County Cricket Club= Entering the 2012 season, having been afflicted by a second shoulder operation, Blackwell played few matches in the first half of the season for Durham. The county then agreed to loan him from August to Warwickshire, who required coverage for the four-week absence of spinner Jeetan Patel. In January 2013, Durham terminated Blackwell's contract leading to his retirement from professional cricket in March 2013. After a third shoulder operation over the winter, Blackwell had been diagnosed with arthritis in his left shoulder. International career Blackwell was called up for the England Test squad after Ashley Giles had to withdraw from the 2006 tour to India. After impressing in warm-up matches, he was selected for the 1st Test against India on 1 March in Nagpur. However, he was not frequently used by captain Andrew Flintoff, only bowling six fairly expensive overs in the first Indian innings, in comparison to fellow left arm spinner Monty Panesar's 42 overs. In the second Indian innings, Blackwell was initially more economical but as India went on an audacious chase of the huge total set to them by England, he was brought on to prevent the batsmen from scoring quickly, but conceded 18 runs in his first over. This came after a nervous innings of only 4 in his only opportunity with the bat, and Blackwell was subsequently dropped for the second Test, replaced by Liam Plunkett. Blackwell remained first choice spinner for the One Day International (ODI) series however. Although England lost the series 5‚Äì1, Blackwell's performances were encouraging and seemed to indicate he was ready to hold down a regular place in the side. Ten overs in the first ODI went for just 24 runs at the same time as picking up one wicket, his cheapest ever spell in an ODI, while he also picked up figures of 2‚Äì39 and 2‚Äì21. Blackwell looked set to make another Test match appearance against Sri Lanka, but suffered a shoulder injury which derailed his season. As a consequence he was replaced as spinner in England's ODI side, and was subsequently overlooked by the selectors. Umpiring career While still playing, Blackwell got his first taste of umpiring, taking control of a handful of local matches in Durham. After retiring in 2013, Blackwell turned his full attention to umpiring, initially officiating in Minor County and Second XI cricket. In December 2014 Blackwell was added to ECB's reserve list of first-class umpires. Blackwell made his debut in First-class cricket in April 2015 in a match between Somerset and Durham MCC University at Taunton. He umpired his first match in the County Championship in April 2016.

History It was the mostly used route during the 13th century arrival of Assam in India by the Ahoms, a Shan tribe. The British in the late 19th century looked at the pass as a possible railway route from India to Myitkyina in north Burma through the Hukawng Valley, all of which were part of the British Empire at the time, but no railway was built. During World War II the pass became famous because of the Stilwell Road connecting British India to Nationalist Chinese forces fighting the Japanese in China. The pass was the large initial obstacle encountered by United States General Joseph \\"Vinegar Joe\\" Stilwell's forces in their effort to build a land route to supplement The Hump air route (after the other land route, the Burma Road was lost to advancing Japanese forces). The Stilwell Road began at Ledo, Assam, the railhead, and passed through Tirap Gaon, Lekhapani, Tipong, Jagun, Jairampur (the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh boundary and beginning of Inner Line), and Nampong before switchbacking steeply upwards through densely forested hills to the pass, away.

The members of the group originally performed under the stage names Babe-B-Face Kaos (later Lee Majors), Mister Man (later King Khaliyl) and Y-Tee (later Light). The three grew up in Jamaica and Trinidad, where reggae strongly influenced their style. It was in 1992 in Brooklyn, New York, United States, where Mister Man first saw Kaos perform, that the group was formed. The two began collaborating, and after Mister Man suggested adding a reggae toaster, Y-Tee joined the group. After their early concert dates attracted major-label interest, the trio performed live office auditions and signed with Reprise three months after launching the group. Their first album, Ambushed (1994), featured production from Jay Matias, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Salaam Gibbs (later known as Salaam Remi) and the group itself, among others. Later releases included \\"Remember We\\" in 1995 and their 1996 second album Gravity, which was the group's first underground and commercial success. Its lead single, \\"The Love Song\\", was produced by Posdnous of De La Soul; that single also featured a then-unknown Mos Def singing the chorus, who also sang the chorus and rapped the third verse of the album's seventh track, \\"S.O.S\\".

David originally appeared from 23 December 1993 to 21 November 1996. He returned to the show on 1 January 2012 and departed two weeks later. French returned to the role in September 2013. David has been involved in various storylines, such as his troubled and dysfunctional reconciliation with his biological children Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and Joe Wicks (Paul Nicholls), ‚Äîhis volatile and equally dysfunctional relationship with his mother Pat Butcher (Pam St Clement), an affair with his half-sister-in-law Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins), reuniting with Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) and struggling to cope with her diagnosis of breast cancer. On 17 May 2014, it was announced that French had once again decided to leave the show. David last appeared on 30 May 2014, after his relationship with Carol broke down.  Storylines  =Backstory= David is the son of Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) and her first husband Pete Beale (Peter Dean). Pat and Pete split up when David and his brother Simon (Nick Berry) were young and Pat remarried to Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield), who adopted both David and Simon (who turned out to be Brian's biological son). Meanwhile, Pete remarried to Kathy Hills (Gillian Taylforth) and had another son, Ian (Adam Woodyatt). Pete had no further contact with David and Simon when they moved away from Walford in 1976. During his teenage years David got his girlfriend Carol Branning (Lindsey Coulson) pregnant at the age of 14. David and the rest of the Branning family tried to persuade Carol to have an abortion and Carol's brother Derek Branning (Terence Beesley, later Jamie Foreman) severely beat David up. The Wicks family left Walford, due to Derek's aggression so David never knew if Carol had the abortion or not. For the next few years, David, his mother and brother, suffered at the violent hands of his abusive stepfather, Brian. Pat also proved to be a negligent mother due to her alcoholism and constant promiscuity. In 1979, the 17-year-old David moved to live with his girlfriend, Lorraine Foster (Jacqueline Leonard), and she quickly becomes pregnant. They married in a quick wedding ceremony before the birth of their son Joe (Paul Nicholls) in 1980 when David was 18. This was followed by a daughter, Karen, in 1982. David was a restless man feeling tied down and after several affairs he left his wife and children in 1988. =1993‚Äì1996= David Wicks as he appeared in 1995. David returns to Albert Square on 23 December 1993 for the funeral of his father Pete, who had died in a car crash two weeks earlier but does not interact with anyone. A few weeks later he moves in with his mother Pat and soon goes into business with her stepson Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) with a car lot that they name \\"Deals on Wheels\\". David receives a stark reminder of his past in the form of Carol and her large brood of children, who have just moved into Albert Square, and soon finds himself falling for her oldest daughter Bianca (Patsy Palmer). Carol is very hostile towards him, and is horrified when she witnesses the growing flirtatious relationship between David and Bianca. This results in Carol telling David that Bianca is his daughter in March 1994. David is horrified and agrees to keep his distance from Bianca, much to her chagrin. The truth is revealed to an embarrassed Bianca in March 1995 when, after drunkenly trying to kiss David after he rescues her from being mugged, David is forced to confess that she is his daughter. Despite being initially hostile towards David over his absence during the majority of her life, Bianca has a change of heart and is keen to bond with her father. But the relationship is further complicated, when during July 1995, David confides in the Samaritans charity (unbeknownst to any of his family) that he still feels sexually attracted to Bianca despite the knowledge that he is her biological father. A case of GSA, this was one of EastEnders most controversial and daring storylines at this point in the show's history. There is further tension when Bianca makes David uncomfortable by dating his stepbrother Ricky. Though David's unexplained strange behaviour towards Bianca is never fully explained to an unaware and confused Bianca, they eventually form a close bond naturally as a father and daughter. David's estranged son Joe arrives in Walford in April 1996. With him comes the news that his daughter Karen died in a car accident nine months previously. Joe's return causes many problems for David, and at first David rejects the idea of having his son back in his life. However, after Joe runs away and arrives back at David's again, he becomes more receptive to Joe and the idea of having him in his life again. Eventually Joe and Lorraine move down to London from Bolton and Joe moves in with David. However, Joe seriously blames himself for Karen's death, and this leads to Joe developing schizophrenia. Joe exhibits increasingly strange behaviour that gets progressively worse. This is one of the main reasons that David eventually leaves Walford. David is a notorious womaniser. He has relations with Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook) and an affair with Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins), the wife of his half-brother Ian. Cindy becomes obsessed with the idea of running off with David, and hires a hit man to kill Ian. Ian is shot but survives, and when David finds out he ends the relationship, but not before helping Cindy escape with her two sons. Shortly after, David has a fling with ex-partner, Carol. Eventually, the truth is revealed about David's affair with Cindy and his fore-knowledge of the attempted murder of Ian. The loss of friends and alienation of his family, together with Joe's worsening mental condition with schizophrenia leads David to decide leave Albert Square for Milan. David leaves in a torrent of tears after telling Joe he is going. =2012-2014= In 2010, Bianca receives ¬£10,000 for her wedding from David, as he is unable to attend. In December 2011, Pat phones David after she learns that he has had an affair with his brother Simon's wife. Pat argues with David on the phone about his infidelity, and ends the call on bad terms. David returns the following month after hearing that Pat is ill. He is later stunned to discover that Pat is in fact dying of pancreatic cancer. They argue and David resolves to leave, but Carol persuades him to stay. Derek arrives and provokes David, and a fight breaks out. David tells Derek he is staying and returns to Pat, where he forgives her for her past mistakes and she dies in his arms. David decides to stay in Walford to plan Pat's funeral. He flirts with Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) and goes to have sex with her, but has second thoughts and nothing happens. David then declares his love for Carol. She reciprocates, and the pair reunite. David tries to settle his differences with Derek, but Derek threatens him. Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) suggests to David that they should team up to bring Derek down and get him arrested. David agrees after Derek upsets Carol. They attempt to set Derek up by having Michael plant stolen goods in Derek's home. However, Derek catches Michael in the act, and Michael blames the entire scheme on David. When David learns of this he begs Carol to leave with him. Carol agrees, but after Pat's funeral, David is confronted by Derek and his brothers Jack (Scott Maslen) and Max (Jake Wood). Derek threatens to kill David, but Jack and Max restrain Derek as they let David go. As he returns to his car to meet Carol, he sees her saying an emotional goodbye to Bianca and her family, so realises her family needs her and leaves without her. David sends a letter to Carol but it is intercepted and locked away by Derek. After Derek dies, the letter is found and Carol tries to contact David but discovers his phone number has been disconnected. Several months later, David unexpectedly arrives at Carol's house, interrupting her evening with her boyfriend, Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra), saying he has a present for Bianca. His girlfriend Naomi (Lisa Maxwell) arrives with a suitcase of cash that they stole from her husband Don (Simon Thorp). Naomi realises that David wants to give some of the cash to Bianca, and when he says they are just using each other, she calls Don, who arrives and beats David up. Carol takes him in, which bothers Masood. When he recovers, he agrees to leave but manipulates Carol into letting him stay until Bianca returns. He attempts to meddle in Masood and Carol's relationship because he wants Carol back. When Bianca returns, she is overjoyed to see David, but asks him to leave for Carol's sake. However, she changes her mind when she decides she wants her father around. David realises that Max is in prison because he was set up by Carl White (Daniel Coonan) and that Ian is probably lying about being a witness. When David cannot convince Ian to retract his statement, he tells Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) what he knows, who kidnaps Ian so that Max is set free and Carol has her brother back. In gratitude, Max offers David a job at the car lot. David and Carol drift apart and she asks him to leave the family home. After Alice's brother Joey Branning (David Witts) tips him off, David becomes suspicious that his former stepsister Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) killed Michael and has framed Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks). He manipulates Janine into letting him move in and then into confessing the murder. He records the confession on his phone and blackmails Janine into giving him ¬£250,000 or he will reveal the truth. When Carol starts to act erratically, David asks her what the matter is. She brings him along to a doctor's appointment where he discovered she has breast cancer. Carol later invites David to move back in with him. Janine panics that she may go to prison and decides to kill David by running him over with a car, but he suffers only minor injuries. He takes Janine to her house and takes the ¬£250,000, but agrees to wait a day before calling the police, so that Janine can have a chance to be a mother to her daughter Scarlett Moon, while still ensuring Alice's release from prison. He also blurts out about Carol's cancer to Janine, saying that he wants the money to pay for her care. David returns to Carol's house, where she reveals she found his phone and has heard Janine's confession. He asks for his phone back, but she tells him that she's handed it to Joey. When he goes to stop Joey, he sees Janine being arrested. David asks Max, who rents the car lot building, if he can have a 50% control of the business, and offers him ¬£50,000 to do it up. When Max refuses, David tells him about Carol's illness and he decides to accept the offer. However, Max is furious when he finds the porter cabin that he uses being taken away. About an hour later, a bigger porter cabin arrives with a new name, titled Deals On Wheels. David later buys the building from Roxy, for ¬£100,000, leaving him in full control of the business. However, he promises Carol that he will continue to treat Max properly. In February 2014, Carol dumps Masood, after realising that she still loves David, and the couple get engaged the following month. In the build-up to the wedding, David is tempted by Nikki Spraggan (Rachel Wilde), and kisses her on one occasion, though he regrets this and rejects her on several other occasions. When Bianca discovers this, David reaffirms his love for Carol. On the day of the wedding, David suffers a heart attack and collapses in the middle of the Square, leading Carol to believe that he has jilted her again. He is taken into hospital, where Carol eventually realises he is, and visits him. However, they argue, as Carol believes that he isn't as ill as he is making out. Carol leaves the hospital. David discharges himself the next day, and visits Carol at home. Despite their attempts to save their relationship, both concede that they cannot work. After sharing one last dance together, David agrees to move out and also to return to hospital. However, he changes his mind at the last minute and asks his driver to take him to Heathrow Airport alone. It is later revealed that David is living in the United States. Development =Departure= It was announced in February 1996 that French and Michelle Collins had decided to quit their roles of David and Cindy in order to pursue other roles. An EastEnders insider said that Cindy is desperate for David to leave the Square with her and the children and is said to \\"rock the square\\". Producers were reportedly trying to keep French with the show but only managed to persuade him to stay for another few months. French was rumoured to have \\"cracked up\\" when filming his final scenes as David. He broke down during filming and said to the cast: \\"I can't go on\\". An insider said that French repeatedly kept getting one line wrong and later stormed off set and refused to continue until crew members were able to calm him down. =Reintroduction= On 7 July 2011, it was announced that St. Clement had quit EastEnders. In October 2011, it was rumoured that David and Simon were to return to EastEnders for Pat's departure storyline. The Sun reported producers were working to get French and Berry on board. A BBC spokesperson declined to comment on the report, saying \\"There has been a lot of speculation surrounding Pat's departure, however we are not going to comment on rumours at this stage as we don't want to spoil the storyline for viewers.\\" On 13 November 2011, it was confirmed French would be reprising his role as David after an absence of 15 years. French returned to EastEnders as David Wicks in 2012 after more than 15 years away for the departure of Pam St Clement, who played his on-screen mother, Pat Butcher. His return was aired on New Year's Day 2012 and he again departed the soap on 13 January 2012. In All About Soap Awards 2012, Michael French won the Best Comeback award for his brief return as David Wicks. David and Carol reconcile. Coulson explained \\"Carol thinks, 'Why not?'

Al- Bi·π≠r≈´jƒ´ was the first astronomer to present a non-Ptolemaic astronomical system as an alternative to Ptolemy's models, with the planets borne by geocentric spheres. Another original aspect of his system was that he proposed a physical cause of celestial motions. His alternative system spread through most of Europe during the 13th century. The crater Alpetragius on the Moon is named after him. Life Almost nothing about his life is known, except that his name probably derives from Los Pedroches (al-Bi·π≠rawsh), a region near Cordoba. He was a disciple of Ibn Tufail (Abubacer) and was a contemporary of Averroes.  Planetary model  Al-Bitruji proposed a theory on planetary motion in which he wished to avoid both epicycles and eccentrics,Bernard R. Goldstein (March 1972). \\"Theory and Observation in Medieval Astronomy\\", Isis 63 (1), p. 39-47 [41]. and to account for the phenomena peculiar to the wandering stars, by compounding rotations of homocentric spheres. This was a modification of the system of planetary motion proposed by his predecessors, Ibn Bajjah (Avempace) and Ibn Tufail (Abubacer). He was unsuccessful in replacing Ptolemy's planetary model, as the numerical predictions of the planetary positions in his configuration were less accurate than those of the Ptolemaic model,Ptolemaic Astronomy, Islamic Planetary Theory, and Copernicus's Debt to the Maragha School, Science and Its Times, Thomson Gale.(inaccessible document) because of the difficulty of mapping Ptolemy's epicyclic model onto Aristotle's concentric spheres. It was suggested based on the Latin translations that his system is an update and reformulation of that of Eudoxus of Cnidus combined with the motion of fixed stars developed by al- ZarqƒÅlƒ´. However, it is not known whether the Andalusian cosmologists had access or knowledge of Eudoxus works. One original aspects of al-Bi·π≠r≈´jƒ´'s system is his proposal of a physical cause of celestial motions. He combines the idea of \\"impetus\\" (first proposed by John Philoponus) and the concept of (\\"desire\\"), of Ab≈´ al‚ÄêBarakƒÅt al‚ÄêBaghdƒÅdƒ´, to explain how energy is transferred from a first mover placed in the 9th sphere to other spheres, explaining the other spheres' variable speeds and different motions. He contradicts the Aristotelian idea that there is a specific kind of dynamics for each world, applying instead the same dynamics to the sublunar and the celestial worlds. His alternative system spread through most of Europe during the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued up to the 16th century. Copernicus cited his system in the De revolutionibus while discussing theories of the order of the inferior planets. Works Al-Bitruji wrote KitƒÅb al-Hay æah (The book of theoretical astronomy/cosmology, Arabic, ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑŸáŸäÿ¶ÿ©), which presented criticism of Ptolomy's Almagest from a physical point of view. It was well known in Europe between the 13th and the 16th centuries, and was regarded as a valid alternative to Ptolemy's Almagest in scholastic circles. This work was translated into Latin by Michael Scot in 1217 as De motibus celorum Pederson, Olaf. (1978) Science in the Middle Ages. ed. by David Lindberg. Chicago: Chicago University Press. p. 321 (first printed in Vienna in 1531). A Hebrew translation by Moses ibn Tibbon was done in 1259. There is also an anonymous treatise on tides (Escorial MS 1636, dated 1192) which contains material seemingly borrowed from al-Bitruji.

Biography Mitchell was born on September 20, 1927, in New York City. His younger brother, Whitey Mitchell, also became a jazz bassist. Mitchell was raised in New Jersey by a father who was an engineer and loved music, and a mother who loved poetry. His first instruments were piano, alto saxophone, and clarinet. Although Cornell University awarded him an engineering scholarship, by 1947 he was in the US Army playing bass. The next year he was in a jazz trio in New York City. Mitchell performed and/or recorded with Mundell Lowe, Chubby Jackson, Charlie Ventura, Woody Herman, Red Norvo, Gerry Mulligan, and, after joining the West Coast jazz scene in the early 1950s, with Andr√© Previn, Shelly Manne, Hampton Hawes, Billie Holiday, Stan Seltzer, Ornette Coleman, and others such as Mahalia Jackson. He also worked as a bassist in the TV and film studios around Los Angeles, occasionally appearing on screen. Mitchell also appeared in documentaries about Tal Farlow and Zoot Sims. Saxophonist Harold Land and Mitchell founded and co-led a quintet in the early 1960s. Mitchell moved to Stockholm in 1968. He won Sweden's Grammis Award in 1986 and again in 1991 for his recorded performances as a pianist, bassist, and vocalist, and for his compositions and poetic song lyrics. During this period, Mitchell performed and/or recorded with Clark Terry, Lee Konitz, Herb Ellis, Jim Hall, Joe Pass, Kenny Barron, Hank Jones, Ben Webster, Bill Mays, Warne Marsh, Jimmy Rowles, Phil Woods, Roger Kellaway, Putte Wickman and others. He frequently collaborated in duos, most notably with pianist Kellaway after the mid-1980s. Returning to the United States in early 1992, Mitchell settled in Oregon where he died of a stroke at age 65 on November 8, 1992. A collection of his poetry was published posthumously. His widow is preparing a biography. Technique and playing style Mitchell used standard tuning during the 1950s and for the first half of the 1960s, and produced sound similar to his professional jazz bass peers. However, \\"in 1966 he switched to cello tuning on his bass (C-G-D-A, an octave below the cello, instead of the standard E-A- D-G). At the same time, he began adjusting the tone controls of his amplifier to create a soft, unfocused sound in the lowest notes and to emphasize the upper harmonics in higher notes. The result was an airy tone quality that sounded gentle, not muscular. This airy tone and his frequent habit of strumming the strings with his right thumb contributed greatly to his unusual style.\\" Discography =As leader/co-leader= * Happy Minors (Bethlehem, 1955) 10\\" LP with Bob Brookmeyer and Zoot Sims * Red Mitchell (Bethlehem, 1956) * Presenting Red Mitchell (Contemporary, 1957) * Get Those Elephants Out'a Here (MetroJazz, 1958) with Whitey Mitchell, Blue Mitchell and Andr√© Previn * Rejoice!

Biography Freer was born and educated in South Africa. He grew up on the edge of a city next to a ~500-acre nature preserve of coastal bush. His father crewed on a commercial fishing boat on weekends. After a stint in boarding school, where he learned \\"Smoking, strong drink and pursuit of wild women\\",Dave Freer's website. he was conscripted at the age of 17 into the South African Defence Force and sent to the Angolan border as a medic (his last choice). \\"My choices were five years in jail, leave the country, or go in for a year. I'm a strong swimmer, but the Atlantic seemed too large....\\" The year stretched into two. Afterwards he married, went to university and became an ichthyologist, then worked as research officer for the Western Cape commercial shark fishery. To make ends meet, and alleviate writing \\"amazingly dull\\" papers on fishery matters, he moonlighted as a commercial diver for a mussel farm. He managed a fish farm for a time, but the farm was forced to close (through no fault of his own) and he started to write. Six years and 74 rejections later, his first book (The Forlorn) was published by Baen Books. Dave is an ardent rock-climber and has opened many routes near Morgan's Bay in the Eastern Cape (South Africa). He is also an accomplished chef, winetaster, and also enjoys fly-fishing and diving.

It is the sequel to 4x4 Evolution and features more trucks, and more racing tracks than the original game. The courses are primarily in extreme environments such as deserts, canyons, and other off-road locales. Players are allowed to customize their vehicle to their liking with a variety of engines, suspensions, wheels, tires, and other aftermarket parts and modifications. Despite the PlayStation 2 version of this game being developed in North America by Terminal Reality (in the United States particularly), it was exclusively released in Europe for unknown reasons, unlike all their other titles released for the system. The Mac and GameCube versions, on the other hand, were exclusively released in North America. Gameplay =Settings= Different settings for vehicles, time of day, and weather are available to choose from. But unlike the first 4x4 Evolution, the night and pitch black settings were removed due to a possibly unstable frame rate, which was never fixed allegedly because it was just simply not fixable. =Missions= The player may also play through missions set in various locations, which typically revolve around locating various objects in the area.

He later had a successful solo career from 1965 to 1974, followed by a string of major duet hits with fellow country music vocalist Helen Cornelius, through 1981. Brown was also the host of the Country Music Greats Radio Show, a syndicated country music program from Nashville, Tennessee. Biography Jim Ed was born on April 1, 1934, in Sparkman, Arkansas, to Floyd and Birdie Brown. His parents owned a farm and his father also worked at a sawmill. As small children, Jim and his sisters, Maxine and Bonnie, moved with their parents to Pine Bluff, Arkansas. As young adults, the three siblings sang together and individually. This changed in 1954 when Jim Ed and Maxine signed a recording contract as a duo. They earned national recognition and a guest spot on Ernest Tubb's radio show for their humorous song \\"Looking Back To See\\", which hit the top ten and stayed on the charts through the summer of 1954. =The Browns= Jim Ed and Maxine were joined in 1955 by 18-year-old Bonnie, and The Browns began performing on Louisiana Hayride in Shreveport, Louisiana. By the end of 1955, the trio were appearing on KWTO-AM in Springfield, Missouri, and had another top ten hit with \\"Here Today and Gone Tomorrow\\", which got a boost by their national appearances on ABC-TV's Ozark Jubilee. They signed with RCA Victor in 1956, and soon had two major hits, \\"I Take the Chance\\" and \\"I Heard the Bluebirds Sing\\". When Jim Ed was drafted in 1957, the group continued to record while he was on leave, and sister Norma filled in for him on tours. He was stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado. In 1959, The Browns scored their biggest hit when their folk-pop single \\"The Three Bells\\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop and country charts. The song also peaked at No. 10 on Billboard's Rhythm and Blues listing. Remakes of the pop hits \\"Scarlet Ribbons\\" and \\"The Old Lamplighter\\" continued the hit streak, reaching the top 15 on Billboard's Pop and Country surveys. The trio had moderate successes on the country music charts for seven years thereafter. In 1963, they joined the Grand Ole Opry and in 1967 the group disbanded. =Solo career= Brown performing in 2012 Brown continued to record for RCA Victor and had a number of country hits, starting in 1965 while still with his sisters. In 1967, he released his first solo top ten hit, \\"Pop a Top\\", which became his signature song. Beginning in 1969, he also gained his own syndicated TV series \\"The Country Place\\", which would become famous for introducing Crystal Gayle. The show ended in 1971. In 1970, he gained a crossover hit with \\"Morning\\" which went to No. 4 on the country charts and No. 47 on the pop charts. Other hits included \\"Angel's Sunday\\" (1971), \\"Southern Loving\\" (1973), \\"Sometime Sunshine\\" (1974) and \\"It's That Time Of Night\\" (1974). Beginning in 1976, Brown released a string of major duet hits with Helen Cornelius starting with the No. 1 hit, \\"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You\\". Other hits for the duo included \\"Saying Hello, Saying I Love You, Saying Goodbye\\" (1977), \\"Born Believer\\" (1977), \\"I'll Never Be Free\\" (1978), \\"If the World Ran Out of Love Tonight\\" (1978), \\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\" (a cover of the then-recent Neil Diamond-Barbra Streisand hit) (1979), \\"Lying In Love With You\\" (1979), \\"Fools\\" (1979), \\"Morning Comes Too Early\\" (1980) and \\"Don't Bother to Knock\\" (1981). Brown hosted the syndicated country television show Nashville on the Road, along with Jerry Clower, Helen Cornelius, and Wendy Holcombe. The entire cast was replaced in 1981. The new host, Jim Stafford, kept hosting it until it ended in 1983. He also hosted The Nashville Network programs, You Can Be A Star (a talent show), and Going Our Way, which featured Brown and his wife traveling the U.S. in an RV. Brown lived in the south Nashville suburb of Brentwood, Tennessee, with his wife Becky. =Radio host= Brown hosted two nationally syndicated country music radio shows, the weekly two-hour Country Music Greats Radio Show and the weekday short-form vignette, Country Music Greats Radio Minute. Both were broadcast by over 300 radio stations to a weekly audience exceeding three million, as well as on the Internet. Recorded at the Hard Scuffle Studios in Nashville, the Country Music Greats Radio Show blended music from the 1940s through the 1990s with an interview archive of country stars past and present. Brown also told tales of living and working in the country music industry. =Dollar General Stores Spokesperson= Beginning in 1975, Brown became a national spokesperson for the Dollar General Stores discount retailer. He appeared in frequent TV advertisements using the slogan, \\"Every day is dollar day at your Dollar General Store,\\" and an autographed photo hung behind the cash register at many stores. =Grand Ole Opry= An active and popular member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1963, Jim Ed Brown would remain so until his death. He would occasionally reunite there with Helen Cornelius to perform their hit duets together. =Country Music Hall of Fame= In March 2015, it was announced that the Browns would be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame later in the year. With his health declining, Brown was inducted in June. Illness and death Brown announced in September 2014 that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer and had temporarily retired from hosting his radio programs to undergo treatment. By early 2015 he was in remission and returned to hosting his radio programs. However, on June 3, 2015, he stated that the cancer had returned. Brown died a week later on June 11, 2015, at the age of 81.

The last four minutes of the song is an instrumental outro. The single was released on 30 March 1992, and reached number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. It was the second of two singles released from their d√©but album while the band were estranged from their label Silvertone. The track's title and its placing as the final song on the album is believed to have influenced the title of their long-awaited follow-up album, Second Coming, which was released five years later. Q magazine placed it at number 10 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. NME magazine placed \\"I Am the Resurrection\\" at number 8 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever.

In addition to the title alluding to John 11, he argues that there are references to stubbornness and repentance found in the prophetic literature of the Old Testament (which repeatedly uses the language of \\"turning\\" to God) and persistence and redemption in the New Testament which uses the language of knocking at doors (e.g. Luke 11.5-10; Luke 13.23-27).

P. Taylor, is the author of the best-selling novels Shadowmancer,(which has been translated into 48 languages) ,have been translated into forty-eight languages Wormwood and Tersias. Before taking up writing full-time, he was a police officer, motorcyclist and former rock band roadie turned Anglican vicar in the village of Cloughton, North Yorkshire. Taylor has three children and currently resides in Whitby, North Yorkshire.  Biography  Taylor grew up in Yorkshire, but moved to London in the 1970s where he worked in the music industry with such bands as The Stranglers, Sex Pistols, Elvis Costello and Adam and the Ants. He became involved in the occult, and lived a life that was, in his own words \\"into all sorts of weird and wonderful things and wasn‚Äôt leading a godly life\\". He then turned to Christianity, and he later became a vicar with the Church of England. Taylor completed the manuscript of his first book, Shadowmancer, which he self- published. Following its launch at Taylor's local bookshop, The Whitby Bookshop, the title garnered a publishing deal with Faber and Faber in the UK and G. P. Putnam's Sons in the United StatesChildren's Writers' and Artists' Yearbook 2007, A&C; Black, p.139 for a further six novels, following which he resigned his position as parish priest. His second novel, Wormwood, was nominated for a Quill Award. His third novel, Tersias was published in the UK in 2005. In August 2006, Faber published a follow up to Shadowmancer entitled The Curse of Salamander Street. In October 2006, Taylor released The Tizzle Sisters & Erik through Markosia. A mixture of prose and graphic novel that he deemed an 'illustronovella', Taylor was joined on the book by collaborators Tony Lee, Dan Boultwood, and Harry Potter artist Cliff Wright. He also contributed text to a book on the Yorkshire coast by photographer Mark Denton. Taylor announced his retirement from writing in October 2009 in order to care for his daughter, who suffers from Crohn's disease, although he went on to publish three more books in the years that followed.

She was the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She assumed the job following a recess appointment by President George W. Bush on January 4, 2006. Previously, Myers worked for the Office of Independent Counsel under Kenneth Starr and was a lead prosecutor in the Independent Counsel's failed case against Susan McDougal. She currently is CEO for Guidepost Solutions, LLC, a leading investigative and compliance consulting firm. After leaving the Office of Independent Counsel, Myers was appointed Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the Department of Commerce. In that capacity, she oversaw 170 employees and a $25 million budget for one year. She is the niece of former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Richard Myers and is the wife of John F. Wood, the former US Attorney for the Western District of Missouri and the former chief of staff for the Secretary of Homeland Security. Michael Chertoff, the Secretary of Homeland Security at the time, was her boss. Assistant secretary On June 30, 2005, Myers was nominated by President Bush to head up the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. On September 15, she testified in front of the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The committee approved Myers's nomination on a strict party-line vote (with Republicans voting for the nomination). The full Senate never voted on the nomination, and President Bush gave her a recess appointment on January 4, 2006 to remain in effect until January 3, 2007. He renominated her on January 9, 2007. Despite some criticism and controversy, Myers was finally confirmed by the Senate on December 19, 2007. On November 5, 2008, the day after the election of Barack Obama, Secretary Chertoff announced the resignation of Myers effective November 15. Myers was succeeded by ICE Deputy Assistant Secretary for Operations John P. Torres, a career ICE employee. Criticism Because the head of ICE is required by law to have at least five years of legal and management experience, three senators, two Republicans (George V. Voinovich, Ohio; Susan Collins, Maine) and one independent (Joseph I. Lieberman, Connecticut), expressed grave concerns that Myers lacked sufficient law enforcement experience, despite her experience as a federal prosecutor and previously running another federal law enforcement agency under the Department of Commerce. Significant criticism came from conservative commentators, including The National Review, which urged President Bush to nominate a candidate with more experience.http://www.nationalreview.com/editorial/editors200509221416.asp Myers was criticized for some of the methods used by ICE agents during work site enforcement raids they conducted while she was head of ICE, including subjecting people to interrogation and denying access to bathrooms without an escort. Myers responded that the methods used were legal, citing a 1984 Supreme Court ruling. Myers also presided over many instances of alleged and reported abuse by ICE at numerous detention centers across the country. For example, Hiu Lui Ng died of cancer in 2008 while in detention, having not been allowed medical treatment and experiencing brutal treatment at the hands of ICE employees. As one inquiry found, guards would drag Ng along the floor when he was not physically able to walk. Controversy On Halloween in 2007, Myers hosted a costume party for ICE employees of which she was a judge.\\"The staff member who won the \\"most original costume\\" prize wore a dreadlock wig, what looked like a prison jumpsuit and black face paint. \\"I'm a Jamaican detainee from Krome ‚Äî obviously, I've escaped,\\" the employee, referring to a detention center in Miami, announced to the judges [..]\\" They awarded a top costume prize to a white Homeland Security Department employee dressed as an escaped Jamaican prisoner, complete with a prison jumpsuit, dreadlocks and blackface. Although Myers issued an apology after employees complained the costume was racist and inappropriate, she had been photographed smiling with the costumed employee in question. Under Myers, the employee was temporarily transferred from the agency headquarters to a field office, and an attempt allegedly made to delete the photographs.\\"DHS employee put on leave after wearing 'offensive' costume\\" by Jeanne Meserve and Mike M. Ahlers, November 6, 2007 The photographs, however, were not permanently deleted and the House Committee report featured the shot of Myers smiling with the employee as evidence. Initially, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff dismissed criticism of Myers: \\"She was kind of caught by surprise by this and in the middle of the party.\\" \\"She was kind of caught by surprise by this and in the middle of the party and I know she's mortified, but I think she's doing what she needs to do at the moment,\\" However, her nomination was delayed.Costume leads to 'hold' on Myers' Senate confirmation, November 7, 2007Nomination for Immigration Agency Chief Imperiled Following Halloween Costume Incident FOX News, Thursday, November 08, 2007 A report by the United States House Committee on Homeland Security ruled that Myers led a \\"coordinated effort to conceal\\" her role in the scandal.

This configuration, with the engine directly driving a pump, was first used by Thomas Newcomen around 1705 to remove water from mines in Cornwall. The efficiency of the engines was improved by engineers including James Watt, who added a separate condenser; Jonathan Hornblower and Arthur Woolf, who compounded the cylinders; and William McNaught, who devised a method of compounding an existing engine. Beam engines were first used to pump water out of mines or into canals, but could be used to pump water to supplement the flow for a waterwheel powering a mill. The cast-iron beam of the 1812 Boulton & Watt engine at Crofton Pumping Station - the oldest working, in situ example in the world Back of Museum De Cruquius near Amsterdam, an old pumping station used to pump dry the Haarlemmermeer. It shows the beams of the pumping engine and the 9 meter drop in water level from the Spaarne river. The beam engine is the largest ever constructed, and was in use till 1933. The remains of a water-powered beam engine at Wanlockhead The rotative beam engine is a later design of beam engine where the connecting rod drives a flywheel, by means of a crank (or, historically, by means of a sun and planet gear). These beam engines could be used to directly power the line-shafting in a mill. They also could be used to power steam ships. History The first beam engines were water-powered, and used to pump water from mines. A preserved example may be seen at the Straitsteps Lead Mine in Wanlockhead in Scotland. Beam engines were extensively used to power pumps on the English canal system when it was expanded by means of locks early in the Industrial Revolution, and also to drain water from mines in the same period, and as winding engines. The first steam-related beam engine was developed by Thomas Newcomen. This was not, strictly speaking, steam powered, as the steam introduced below the piston was condensed to create a partial vacuum thus allowing atmospheric pressure to push down the piston. It was therefore called an Atmospheric Engine. The Newcomen atmospheric engine was adopted by many mines in Cornwall and elsewhere, but it was relatively inefficient and consumed a large quantity of fuel. The engine was improved by John Smeaton but James Watt resolved the main inefficiencies of the Newcomen engine in his Watt steam engine by the addition of a separate condenser, thus allowing the cylinder to remain hot. Technically this was still an atmospheric engine until (under subsequent patents) he enclosed the upper part of the cylinder, introducing steam to also push the piston down. This made it a true steam engine and arguably confirms him as the inventor of the steam engine. He also patented the centrifugal governor and the parallel motion. the latter allowed the replacement of chains round an arch head and thus allowed its use as a rotative engine. His patents remained in place until the start of the 19th Century and some say that this held back development. However, in reality development had been ongoing by others and at the end of the patent period there was an explosion of new ideas and improvements. Watt's beam engines were used commercially in much larger numbers and many continued to run for 100 years or more. Watt held patents on key aspects of his engine's design, but his rotative engine was equally restricted by James Pickard's patent of the simple crank. The beam engine went on to be considerably improved and enlarged in the tin- and copper-rich areas of south west England, which enabled the draining of the deep mines that existed there. Consequently, the Cornish beam engines became world-famous, as they remain among the most massive beam engines ever constructed. Because of the number of patents on various parts of the engines and the consequences of patent infringements, examples exist of Beam Engines with no makers name on any of the parts (Hollycombe Steam Collection). Rotative beam engines A small rotative beam engine, built in 1870 by Thomas Horn to a design by James Watt. The crank is visible at the front, the flywheel part-hidden by the engine. (Originally installed in a waterworks in Ashford, now operational and preserved at the Bredgar and Wormshill Light Railway.) Beam machine by Thomas Horn Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia \\"Leonardo da Vinci\\", Milan. In a rotative beam engine, the piston is mounted vertically, and the piston rod drives the beam as before. A connecting rod from the other end of the beam, rather than driving a pump rod, now drives a flywheel. Early Watt engines used Watt's patent sun and planet gear, rather than a simple crank, as use of the latter was protected by a patent owned by James Pickard. Once the patent had expired, the simple crank was employed universally. Once rotary motion had been achieved a drive belt could be attached beside the flywheel. This transmitted the power to other drive shafts and from these other belts could then be attached to power a variety of static machinery e.g. threshing, grinding or milling machines. = Marine beam engines = The first steam- powered ships used variants of the rotative beam engine. These marine steam engines ‚Äì known as side-lever, grasshopper, crosshead, or 'walking beam', among others ‚Äì all varied from the original land-based machines by locating the beam or beams in different positions to take up less room on board ship. Compounding Compounding involves two or more cylinders; low-pressure steam from the first, high-pressure, cylinder is passed to the second cylinder where it expands further and provides more drive. This is the compound effect; the waste steam from this can produce further work if it is then passed into a condenser in the normal way. The first experiment with compounding was conducted by Jonathan Hornblower, who took out a patent in 1781. His first engine was installed at Tincroft Mine, Cornwall. It had two cylinders ‚Äì one diameter with stroke and one diameter with stroke ‚Äì placed alongside each other at one end of the beam. The early engines showed little performance gain: the steam pressure was too low, interconnecting pipes were of small diameter and the condenser ineffective. At this time the laws of thermodynamics were not adequately understood, particularly the concept of absolute zero. Engineers such as Arthur Woolf were trying to tackle an engineering problem with an imperfect understanding of the physics. In particular, their valve gear was cutting-in at the wrong position in the stroke, not allowing for expansive working in the cylinder. Successful Woolf compound engines were produced in 1814, for the Wheal Abraham copper mine and the Wheal Vor tin mine. McNaught engines William McNaught patented a compound beam engine in 1845. On a beam engine of the standard Boulton & Watt design he placed a high-pressure cylinder, on the opposite side of the beam to the existing single cylinder, where the water pump was normally fitted. This had two important effects: it massively reduced the pressure on the beam, and the connecting steam pipe, being long, acted as an expansive receiver ‚Äì the element missing in the Woolf design. This modification could be made retrospectively, and engines so modified were said to be \\"McNaughted\\".

This effort was promoted by Free Soil Democrats including John P.

He was nominated by the leading opposition parties in Belarus to run against incumbent Alexander Lukashenko in the 2006 presidential election. Biography Milinkeviƒç was born in 1947 in Grodno. After graduating from the University of Hrodna, he defended his Ph.D. thesis at the Institute of Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. Between 1980 and 1984 he was in charge of the (then forming) Faculty of Physics at the University of S√©tif in Algiers. He also served as a docent at the University of Hrodna between 1978 and 1980, and then from 1984 on to 1990. At that time he also started to cooperate with local city authorities as a chief of one of the committees. Soon he reached the rank of deputy mayor of the city. In 2001 he was the chief of staff of Siamion Domash, one of the opposition leaders running for president in the 2001 presidential elections of Belarus. In October 2005 he was chosen by the United Democratic Forces of Belarus as the joint candidate of the opposition in the presidential elections of 2006. Aliaksandr Milinkieviƒç in Poland, 30 March 2006 On 12 December 2006 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament. He is the recipient of the seventh Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award, awarded annually by Prague Society for International Cooperation and the Global Panel Foundation (de). Campaign for presidency In October 2005, at a Congress of Democratic Forces, roughly 900 delegates from various political and civil society groups met in the capital Minsk to pick a single opposition candidate for the 2006 Presidential election. Milinkieviƒç won over three other political leaders at the meeting (including Stanislav Shushkevich and Anatoly Lebedko). The unification process has the aim of selecting a single opposition figure who would run against President Lukashenko, who has run Belarus for over a decade. Belarus' opposition forces had previously tried to field a single candidate in the 2001 presidential elections. Milinkieviƒç compared his campaign to that of another pro-Western opposition candidate in neighboring Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, whose victory in late 2004 was dubbed the \\"Orange Revolution\\". Although disappointment in Yushchenko's government has culminated in political crisis in September 2005 amid renewed allegations of mass graft coupled with a worsening economic situation, Milinkieviƒç calls last year's events in Ukraine an inspiration for his supporters.http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID;=2005-09-28T163259Z_01_HO859543_RTRUKOC_0_UK- UKRAINE.xml&archived;=False \\"We believe that Belarus will be next after‚Ä¶ Ukraine,\\" he told Associated Press.Tom Hundley Bold moves in Belarus October 04, 2005 However, opposition leaders realize that an uphill struggle lies ahead, despite their support from U.S.-funded NGOs. Lukashenko's market socialism economy has significant support in rural areas of the country. Belarus is one of the few areas of the Soviet Union where the country's social welfare network remains virtually unchanged since the Soviet era. In the 2006 presidential election official results gave Milinkieviƒç 6% of the vote against 83% for the incumbent Lukashenko. Confiscation of his leaflets during the campaign was found by the UN Human Rights Committee to violate his rights.HRC views CCPR/C/95/D/1553/2007 In January 2006 Milinkieviƒç was invited to Paris by the French government. He met with the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, and gave numerous interviews to Western media, including a TV interview to Euronews. Milinkieviƒç, just like any other opposition activist, has absolutely no TV access inside Belarus, as the media in Belarus are state-controlled. The only exception when he was allowed to appear on Belarusian television was his pre-election speech in 2006. Earlier, he had already met the new Polish prime minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, and the president of Lithuania Valdas Adamkus. In February 2006 he also met the President of the European Commission, Jos√© Manuel Barroso, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Javier Solana, and several other top European politicians. His campaign received the backing first of the Polish government and later that of prominent EU officials. Personal life Currently married to Inna Kuley, he has two sons from a previous marriage. Aside from his native Belarusian Milinkieviƒç also speaks Polish, French, and Russian. Persecution In April 2006, Milinkieviƒç was jailed by the government for 15 days for taking part in an unsanctioned rally. On 23 November 2006 government police detained Milinkieviƒç three times as he traveled around Vitebsk Region with a local opposition activist who was accused of causing a fatal hit-and-run accident in the past. On 29 November 2006 police detained Milinkieviƒç at a Minsk airport after he returned from a NATO summit in Riga. He was accused of having a forged passport. On 4 December 2006 Milinkieviƒç was detained in Beloozyorsk on suspicion of illegal drug trade. On 6 January 2007 Milinkevich was arrested twice: first on the suspicion of drunk driving (he was found to be sober) and then on the suspicion of being involved in a traffic accident. On 29 January 2007 Milinkevich said he was fined $2,200 after being tried in absence for leaving Belarus illegally. He called it \\"revenge by Lukashenko\\".

The Canadian version was powered by the Rolls- Royce Nene 10 turbojet, whereas the Lockheed production used the Allison J33. Design and development The Canadair CT-133 was the result of a 1951 contract to build T-33 Shooting Star trainers for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). The powerplant is a Rolls-Royce Nene 10 turbojet instead of the Allison J33 used by Lockheed in the production of the original T-33. A project designation of CL-30 was given by Canadair and the name was changed to Silver Star. The appearance of the CT-133 is very distinctive due to the large fuel tanks usually carried on each wingtip. A total of 656 CT-133 aircraft were built by Canadair. Operational history Two CT-133s of the Royal Canadian Navy over Halifax in 1957. The CT-133 entered service in the RCAF as its primary training aircraft for fighter/interceptors. The designation of the Silver Star in the Canadian Forces was CT-133. The CT-133's service life in the RCAF (and later the Canadian Forces) was extremely long. One of the more unusual roles it played was as an aerobatic demonstration aircraft, the RCAF's Red Knight. Although the aircraft stopped being used as a trainer in 1976, there were still over 50 aircraft in Canadian Forces inventory in 1995. The youngest of these airframes was then 37 years old and had exceeded its expected life by a factor of 2.5. During this period, the Canadair T-33 was employed in communication, target towing, and enemy simulation.

Having been built in March 1959 as a CT-133 with original RCAF serial number 21648, it had reached a total of flight hours at the time of its retirement from military use. It has been sold on the civil market, along with fifteen other CT-133s. These aircraft will join the fifty others on the United States Civil Register and continue to fly as a part of the living legacy of the early jet age.

He was a Professor for organic chemistry at the University of Bern from 1935 until 1972. Education Signer was the son of Jakob Signer, a chemical scientist working in the textile industry, and his wife Dorothea Agnes Scherrer. Rudolf Signer went to high school in St. Gallen and matriculated at the ETH Zurich in 1921 to study chemistry, initially in order to become a teacher. 1927 he graduated with his doctorate under the supervision of Hermann Staudinger. Already 1926 he had become Wissenschaftlicher Assistent at the University of Fribourg, where he qualified as a professor with a Habilitation. Career Signer spent 1932‚Äì1933 in Uppsala and Manchester on a Rockefeller- scholarship. He became a non-tenured professor for general and inorganic chemistry at the University of Bern in 1935 and was tenured in 1939. He went on to become director of the university's Institute of Chemistry and retired as emeritus in 1972. Research Signer focused on macromolecular chemistry, in particular with regards to natural products. 1938 he measured and described the DNA, discovering its thread-like structure. 1950 Signer produced extraordinarily pure DNA from the Thymus of calves, of which he took 15 grams of extraordinarily pure DNA to London. In England he gave it to various scientists, among them Maurice Wilkins, in order to promote research in the field. The analysis of X ray images of these DNA samples in Wilkins' laboratory allowed James Watson and Francis Crick to discover the double-helix structure of DNA. Rests of the DNA which Signer brought to England, survive today in the collection of King's College, London. Over 250 of Signer's scientific writings were published during his lifetime. The Lavoisier Medal was awarded to him for his scientific work and achievements.

It is the third bridge at this crossing to bear the name of the adventurer John Ledyard. History The first \\"Ledyard Free Bridge\\" was a covered bridge built in 1859 that was the first bridge across the Connecticut not to charge a toll. (It was the latest of several bridges at this site that went back to the late 18th century.) The bridge was named after Ledyard in 1859 because its eastern abutment was near the site of a tree that Ledyard felled during 1773 in order to make the dugout canoe in which he left Dartmouth College to continue his world travels. The bridge now standing was built between 1998 and 2000 by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation. At each end it displays a pair of \\"bridge balls,\\" the controversial Classical ornaments cast in concrete that refer to the gateway to Tuck Drive nearby on the Hanover shore. They are the product of a Concord architect brought in by NHDOT to infuse some extra aesthetic appeal into the design of the bridge. The Ledyard Bridge carries the designation of New Hampshire Route 10A and Vermont Route 10A, a short state highway linking U.S. Route 5 and Interstate 91 on the Vermont side with New Hampshire Route 10 on the New Hampshire side.  Border location  Although the border between New Hampshire and Vermont was set at the Vermont shore early in the states' histories, the bridge's monument to that border rests near the middle of the crossing; the reasoning is that the border was fixed before the Wilder Dam pushed the Vermont shore westward during the 1950s.

The complex is situated in the west of Leicester City Centre, between Saint Nicholas Circle to the north and De Montfort University to the south. A large motte and the Great Hall are the two substantial remains of what was once a large defensive structure. The hall is now encased in a Queen Anne style frontage. The Castle and the Magazine Gateway is a scheduled monument. History Leicester Castle was part of the medieval town defences, built over the Roman town walls. The castle was probably built around 1070 (soon after the Norman Conquest in 1066) under the governorship of Hugh de Grandmesnil. The remains now consist of a mound, along with ruins. Originally the mound was 40 ft (12.2 m) high. Kings sometimes stayed at the castle (Edward I in 1300, and Edward II in 1310 and 1311), and John of Gaunt and his second wife Constance of Castile both died here in 1399 and 1394 respectively.Leland's Itenerary Vol.1 Page 17 The Collegiate Church Newarke Constance daughter of Peter King of Castile, and wife of John of Gaunt, lieth before that High Altar in a tomb of marble with an image [Brass] (Like A Queen) on itCharles James Billson, Mediaeval Leicester (Leicester, 1920) Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, one of the leading captains in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War died at the castle on 23 March 1361. It became an official royal residence during the reigns of Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI and Edward IV, but by the middle of the 15th century, it was no longer considered suitable and was used mainly as a courthouse; with sessions being held in the Great Hall. Apart from being used for Assize Courts, the Great Hall was also used for sessions of the Parliament of England most notably the Parliament of Bats in 1426, when the conditions in London were not suitable. A section of the castle wall, adjacent to the Turret Gateway, has gun loops (holes) that were poked through the medieval wall to use as firing ports by the city's residents when Parliamentarian Leicester was besieged, captured, and ransacked, during the English Civil War by the main Royalist Field army under Charles I and Prince Rupert on 31 May 1645. The third storey of the Turret Gateway (erroneously known as 'Prince Rupert's gateway') was destroyed in an election riot in 1832. In the 1880s, J. M. Barrie visited the assize courts regularly and spent many hours inside as reporter for the Nottingham Journal when the hall was being used as a court house.

In a professional career that lasted 14 years he played mostly in Spain, with Zaragoza and Atl√©tico Madrid, but also represented Olympiacos, winning five major titles with the latter club. He was also retired from 2010 to 2013, before returning to active with OFI Crete. An Argentina international in the 2000s, Galletti appeared with the national team at the 2005 Confederations Cup. Club career =Early years and Italy= Born in La Plata, Buenos Aires Province, Galletti's career began with Estudiantes de La Plata, where his father Rub√©n Horacio played as a right-wing forward during the 1970s. He scored once in 24 games in his second season in the Primera Divisi√≥n. In January 1999, Galletti joined Parma A.C. in Italy, but failed to break into the first team, moving in the following transfer window to another club in the country, Serie B's S.S.C. Napoli ‚Äì loaned by Estudiantes, to where he would return for the 2000‚Äì01 campaign. =Zaragoza= Galletti signed with Real Zaragoza from Spain in the 2001 off- season. He made his La Liga debut on 26 August in a 1‚Äì2 away loss against RCD Espanyol, and finished his first year with 27 matches and two goals as the season ended in relegation. From there onwards, Galletti became an undisputed starter for the Aragonese, never appearing in less than 34 contests for the remainder of his spell. In 2003‚Äì04 he helped them win the Copa del Rey, scoring the winner in a 3‚Äì2 extra time win over Real Madrid. =Atl√©tico Madrid= On 29 July 2005, Galletti joined fellow league side Atl√©tico Madrid for ‚Ç¨4 million. He netted his first league goal for his new team on 27 October, closing the scoresheet at home against C√°diz CF (3‚Äì0). In his second season with the Colchoneros, Galletti scored four goals in 36 games as they finished in seventh position. =Olympiacos= On 30 June 2007, Galletti was transferred to Olympiacos F.C. in Greece, for a reported fee of ‚Ç¨2.5 million, with the player signing a four-year contract with an annual salary of ‚Ç¨1.3 million. On 2 May 2009, he netted the 4‚Äì4 equalizer against AEK Athens F.C. in the final of the Greek Cup, in another eventual extra time success; after that campaign ended and he contributed with a career-best 14 goals to the national championship's conquest, he signed a contract extension linking him to the Piraeus club until 2013 ‚Äì the new deal contained a release clause fee of ‚Ç¨15 million. In early February 2010, Galletti was diagnosed with severe kidney failure, causing him to miss the rest of the season. He announced his retirement the following summer, aged only 30; in early October 2012, however, he underwent a successful kidney transplant, the donor being his father Rub√©n. Galletti returned to Olympiacos on 3 September 2014 after an unassuming spell as player at OFI Crete FC, being appointed scout for Latin America. International career Galletti was the top scorer at the 1999 South American Youth Championship with nine goals in only eight games, ranking ahead the likes of Ronaldinho and Roque Santa Cruz as the Argentina under-20s won the competition in Paraguay. He earned 13 caps for the full side, making his debut in 2000 and being selected to the squad that appeared in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he played three matches for the eventual runners-up, including the final against Brazil.

Beneath the mosaic is an inscription from Horace's Ars Poetica: \\"Nil invita Minerva, quae monumentum aere perennius exegit, and translated as, Not unwilling, Minerva raises a monument more lasting than bronze.\\" The Epistles (or Letters) of Horace were published in two books, in 20 BCE and 14 BCE, respectively. *Epistularum liber primus (First Book of Letters) is the seventh work by Horace, published in the year 20 BCE. This book consists of 20 Epistles. The phrase sapere aude (\\"dare to be wise\\") comes from this collection of poems. *Epistularum liber secundus (Second Book of Letters) was published in the year 14 BC. This book consists of 3 Epistles. However, the third epistle ‚Äì the Ars Poetica ‚Äì is usually treated as a separate composition.  Background  As one commentator has put it: \\"Horace's Epistles may be said to be a continuation of his Satires in the form of letters... But few of the epistles are [actually] letters except in form...\\"The Works of Horace Rendered into English Prose by James Lonsdale M.A. and Samuel Lee M.A. London: MacMillan and Co., 1883. Edition is available on Google Books. They do indeed contain an excellent specimen of a letter of introduction (I.9); a piece of playful banter (I.14); pieces of friendly correspondence (I.3, I.4 and I.5); while the last, Epistle I.20, is inscribed 'To His Book,\\" and forms a sort of epilogue to the Epistles he had already written. However, as a rule, the Epistles \\"are compositions like those which Pope, following the manner of Horace, has made familiar to us as Moral Essays.\\" The Epistles were published about four years after the first three books of Odes, and were introduced by a special address to his patron Maecenas, as his Odes, Epodes and Satires had been. The form of composition may have been suggested by some of the satires of Lucilius, which were composed as letters to his personal friends... \\"From the Epistles... we gather that [Horace] had gradually adopted a more retired and meditative life, and had become fonder of the country and of study, and that while owing allegiance to no school or sect of philosophy, he was framing for himself a scheme of life, was endeavoring to conform to it, and was bent on inculcating it in others.\\" \\"In both his Satires and Epistles, Horace shows himself a genuine moralist, a subtle observer and true painter of life, and an admirable writer.\\" But in spirit the Epistles are more philosophic, more ethical and meditative. Like the Odes they exhibit the twofold aspects of Horace's philosophy, that of temperate Epicureanism and that of more serious and elevated conviction.  Book 1  Book 1 contains 20 Epistles.Horace, The Complete Works, ed. by Charles E. Bennett and John Carew Rolfe. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1901. Edition is available on Google Books. *I.1 ‚Äì On the Importance of Philosophy - (Dedication to Maecenas, Horace's Patron) :1-19 ‚Äì Horace excuses himself to Maecenas for giving up the composition of lyric poetry, but he is better suited to philosophy as he grows older. However, he is not bound to any particular philosophic school. :20-40 ‚Äì Wisdom is the true business of life; yet most of us must be content with but a moderate share of it: wisdom too is the only power which can tame our passions. :41-69 ‚Äì Men will do and suffer anything to avoid poverty, but they will do nothing to gain virtue, which is more precious than gold. A clear conscience makes a man truly a king. :70-93 ‚Äì He cannot follow the popular ideas, because he sees that they all tend one way - namely, to money-making. Besides, not only do men differ from one another in their pursuits, but no man is ever consistent with himself. :94-108 ‚Äì External inconsistencies are noticed at once, while those of life and practice are passed over. This epistle ends with a joke on the Stoic doctrine of the perfect man. *I.2 ‚Äì Homer: The Teacher of True Philosophy ‚Äì (Addressed to Lollius Maximus) :1-31 ‚Äì Horace begins by demonstrating, in the manner of the Stoic philosophers, the merit of Homer as a teacher of morals. :32-71 ‚Äì Men will take more trouble for bad deeds than for good, and more for the body than the mind. Yet, without contentment and peace of mind, material acquisitions cannot be enjoyed. Avarice and envy are always beggars, and remorse comes after anger. Youth is the time to learn self-control. He shall always adhere to the philosophy of moderation. *I.3 ‚Äì A Literary Staff ‚Äì (Addressed to Julius Florus) :To Julius Florus, who was serving on the staff of Tiberius Claudius Nero. The letter consists mainly of inquiries and observations as to the literary pursuits of members of the staff; and concludes with a hope that the quarrel between Florus and Munatius has ended in a reconciliation. *I.4 ‚Äì An Exhortation to Contentment ‚Äì (Addressed to Albius Tibullus, the Elegaic Poet) :Horace urges his friend to enjoy each passing hour, and suggests that a visit to his Sabine Farm may divert him. *I.5 ‚Äì An Invitation ‚Äì (Addressed to Manlius Torquatus, to whom Horace also wrote Ode IV.7) :Horace invites his friend to dinner ‚Äì Tomorrow is a holiday and Torquatus may well forget his occupations for a time. Horace then extols the virtues of wine (see also Ode III.21); and describes the preparations he is making for the banquet. *I.6 ‚Äì On Philosophic Indifference ‚Äì (Addressed to Numicius) :Equanimity is happiness ‚Äì Fear and desire alike disturb our peace of mind. You will find this maxim true if you seek the chief good in any other pursuit ‚Äì 1) in riches, 2) in political honors, 3) in sumptuous living, or 4) in love and trifling. *I.7 ‚Äì An Independent Spirit ‚Äì (Addressed to Maecenas) :1-24 ‚Äì Horace excuses himself to Maecenas for not keeping his promise to come to Rome, on the ground that it would be dangerous to his health. He feels that this reason will satisfy Maecenas, as being a friend who has always had a sincere regard for his welfare. :25-45 ‚Äì If Maecenas would want him to always be at Rome, then Horace must have back his health and youth. He must be free, even if freedom costs him the loss of all Maecenas' favors. Horace would give back all, as Telemachus refused the horses which were unsuited to his poor and rocky island. :46-95 ‚Äì The story of Volteius Mena and his patron L. Marcius Philippus, with an implied allusion to the relationship between Horace and Maecenas. The attainment of our wishes does not always make us happy. *I.8 ‚Äì A Word of Warning ‚Äì (Addressed to Celsus Albinovanus, who was serving on the staff of Tiberius in the province of Asia) :This letter seems to be a reply. Horace speaks of his own fickleness and discontent, and gently recommends moderation to Celsus in prosperity. *I.9 ‚Äì A Letter of Recommendation ‚Äì (Addressed to Tiberius) :This letter is written to the future emperor Tiberius, in behalf of Titius Septimius, to whom Ode II.6 is addressed. *I.10 ‚Äì The Advantages of Country Life ‚Äì (Addressed to Aristius Fuscus, to whom Ode I.22 is also addressed) :This epistle begins with Horace contrasting his own love of the country with his friend's fondness for the town; then follows the praise of Nature; and finally the poet dwells on the superior happiness that moderate means and contentment afford, compared with riches and ambition. *I.11 ‚Äì On Contentment ‚Äì (Addressed to Bullatius) :To Bullatius who is travelling to Ionia ‚Äì Change of scene does not alter the mind. If the mind is tranquil, the meanest and least interesting of places seem agreeable. *I.12 ‚Äì Consolation ‚Äì (Addressed to Iccius, to whom Ode I.29 is also addressed) :Horace advises Iccius, who is now steward of Agrippa's property in Sicily, to be content, and compliments him on pursuing the study of philosophy. He then encourages him to cultivate the friendship of Pompeius Grosphus, and tells him the news at Rome. *I.13 ‚Äì Instructions to a Messenger ‚Äì (Addressed to Vinius Asina) :Horace sends a copy of his Odes to Augustus by a friend of his court circles ‚Äì Vinius Asina. The poet writes a playful note of instruction to the messenger, whom he likens (on account of his name \\"Asina\\") to a beast of burden. *I.14 ‚Äì Master to Bailiff ‚Äì :Horace writes a letter to his bailiff, who dislikes the country and longs to return to city life; while Horace, detained at Rome, has his heart in the country. *I.15 ‚Äì A Request for Information ‚Äì (Addressed to Numonius Vala) :Horace has decided to spend the winter at the seashore, and now writes to his friend for information about the climate and resources of Velia and Salernum. *I.16 ‚Äì Happiness Depends Upon Virtue ‚Äì (Addressed to Quinctius Hirpinus, to whom Ode II.11 is also addressed) :1-16 ‚Äì Horace describes the simple attractions of his Sabine Farm. :17-45 ‚Äì Advice to his friend not to value too highly the admiration of the masses ‚Äì their honors can be taken away. :46-62 ‚Äì Many a man who seems to be good is actuated by fear, not love ‚Äì his morality is hollow. :63-79 ‚Äì The miser is a slave to his money. The good man is free and fearless, come what will. *I.17 ‚Äì On True Independence ‚Äì (Address to Scaeva) :Horace shows that one may observe proper deference towards a patron without sacrificing one's self-respect. He gives some humorous directions for gaining the favor of great men. *I.18 ‚Äì On the Proper Demeanor Towards a Patron ‚Äì (Addressed to Lollius Maximum) :As in Epistle I.17, Horace assures a friend that he can show proper deference to a patron, without laying himself open to the charge of obsequiousness. *I.19 ‚Äì The Poet on His Critics ‚Äì (Addressed to Maecenas) :The Odes (Books I‚ÄìIII) had evidently met with unfavorable criticism outside the small circle of the poet's friends. He points out to Maecenas the injustice of the charges which have been made against him, and expresses contempt for his detractors. *I.20 ‚Äì Epilogue ‚Äì (Addressed to His Book) :Horace warns his book of Epistles of the fate that attends publishing. He compares it to a young and beautiful slave, and foretells its destiny ‚Äì 1) Success until it falls into the hands of the vulgar; 2) Banishment to the provinces; 3) An old age spent in schools. Book 2 Book 2 consists of 3 epistles. However, the third epistle ‚Äì the Ars Poetica ‚Äì is usually treated as a separate composition. (For further discussion, see the Wikipedia article on the Ars Poetica). *II.1 ‚Äì On Popular Taste and Judgment ‚Äì (Dedication to Augustus) :Horace dedicates his second collection of Epistles to Augustus, who had apparently urged him to undertake something in the line of dramatic or epic poetry. He complains of the poor taste shown by the general public, especially in regard to the drama, and says that he is unwilling to make an attempt in that line. For epic poetry he has no ability. *II.2 ‚Äì A Renunciation of Lyric Poetry ‚Äì (Addressed to Julius Florus, to whom Epistle I.3 is also addressed) :Horace expresses at greater length the same general sentiments as in Epistle I.1 ‚Äì He intends to devote himself to philosophy and to write only in the field represented by the Satires and Epistles. *II.3 ‚Äì Ars Poetica ‚Äì The Art of Poetry ‚Äì (Addressed to The Pisos) :(For further discussion, see the Wikipedia article on the Ars Poetica) :The Ars Poetica is dedicated to Horace's friend Lucius Calpurnius Piso (the Roman senator and consul) and his two sons. :1-23 ‚Äì Unity and simplicity are necessary in a poem. :24-37 ‚Äì We, who would be poets, must guard against all extremes. :38-44 ‚Äì We must well consider our powers before we write. :45-72 ‚Äì We may coin new words when necessary, but this must be done with care: words, like all other things, are subject to change. :73-85 ‚Äì The various kinds of poetry: epic, elegiac, dramatic, lyric. :86-98 ‚Äì We must suit our style to the different kinds of poetry. :99-118 ‚Äì The words also must be suitable to the character in whose mouth the poet puts them. :119-152 ‚Äì A writer should follow the traditions of the Muse; or, if he strikes out something new, must be consistent. No better guide can we follow than Homer. :153-178 ‚Äì A writer too should observe the characteristics of each age of man. :179-188 ‚Äì Some things should be represented on the stage, others related to the spectators. :189-201 ‚Äì Certain rules not to be transgressed. The role of the Chorus. :202-219 ‚Äì Of the music of the stage, and how it changes with the fortunes and manners of the people. :220-250 ‚Äì The Satyric drama, which accompanied the tragedy, is not the same as comedy, and has its rules and wholesome restraints. :251-274 ‚Äì On the Iambic and Spondee. The Greek taste is to be followed, rather than the license of the Roman poets, in respect to meter. :275-294 ‚Äì The origin of tragedy & its development. To it succeeded the old comedy ‚Äì vigorous, but scurrilous. The Latin poets deserve some praise, but their great fault is their careless, slovenly style. :295-308 ‚Äì Genius cannot afford to dispense with the rules of art. The critic has his place in literature. :309-322 ‚Äì Knowledge is the foundation of good writing. Poetry without sense is but a harmonious trifling. :323-333 ‚Äì The Greeks had genius; the Romans are a money-getting race. :334-346 ‚Äì The object of the poet should be to give instruction and delight. :347-360 ‚Äì We do not expect perfection in a poem, but we do expect care and pains. :361-365 ‚Äì A short comparison between poetry and painting. :366-390 ‚Äì Mediocrity in poetry is insufferable ‚Äì For this reason, be careful before you publish. :391-407 ‚Äì The origins and office of poetry in early days. :408-418 ‚Äì Genius is necessary for a poet ‚Äì and yet, without art and study, genius will fail. :419-452 ‚Äì Let poets avoid flatterers. Quinctilius was an honest friend, whose mission it was to tell an author unpleasant truths. :453-476 ‚Äì A poet goes as mad as Empedocles; let all beware of him and keep out of the way of one who will not be helped.

For simple circuits the design process can often be done by one person without needing a planned or structured design process, but for more complex designs, teams of designers following a systematic approach with intelligently guided computer simulation are becoming increasingly common. In integrated circuit design automation, the term \\"circuit design\\" often refers to the step of the design cycle which outputs the schematics of the integrated circuit. Typically this is the step between logic design and physical design.Naveed Sherwani, \\"Algorithms for VLSI Physical Design Automation\\" Process A circuit diagram for the Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip Formal circuit design usually involves a number of stages. Sometimes, a design specification is written after liaising with the customer. A technical proposal may be written to meet the requirements of the customer specification. The next stage involves synthesising on paper a schematic circuit diagram, an abstract electrical or electronic circuit that will meet the specifications. A calculation of the component values to meet the operating specifications under specified conditions should be made. Simulations may be performed to verify the correctness of the design. A breadboard or other prototype version of the design for testing against specification may be built. It may involve the making of any alterations to the circuit to achieve compliance. A choice as to a method of construction as well as all the parts and materials to be used must be made. There is a presentation of component and layout information to draughtspersons, and layout and mechanical engineers, for prototype production. This is followed by the testing or type-testing a number of prototypes to ensure compliance with customer requirements. Usually there is a signing and approval of the final manufacturing drawings and there may be post-design services (obsolescence of components etc.).  Specification  Microchips The process of circuit design begins with the specification, which states the functionality that the finished design must provide, but does not indicate how it is to be achieved . The initial specification is basically a technically detailed description of what the customer wants the finished circuit to achieve and can include a variety of electrical requirements, such as what signals the circuit will receive, what signals it must output, what power supplies are available and how much power it is permitted to consume. The specification can (and normally does) also set some of the physical parameters that the design must meet, such as size, weight, moisture resistance, temperature range, thermal output, vibration tolerance and acceleration tolerance.A. Tajalli, et al., \\"Design trade-offs in ultra-low-power digital nanoscale CMOS,\\" IEEE TCAS-I 2011. As the design process progresses the designer(s) will frequently return to the specification and alter it to take account of the progress of the design. This can involve tightening specifications that the customer has supplied, and adding tests that the circuit must pass in order to be accepted. These additional specifications will often be used in the verification of a design. Changes that conflict with or modify the customer's original specifications will almost always have to be approved by the customer before they can be acted upon. Correctly identifying the customer needs can avoid a condition known as 'design creep' which occurs in the absence of realistic initial expectations, and later by failing to communicate fully with the client during the design process. It can be defined in terms of its results; \\"at one extreme is a circuit with more functionality than necessary, and at the other is a circuit having an incorrect functionality\\".DeMers, 1997 Nevertheless, some changes can be expected and it is good practice to keep options open for as long as possible because it's easier to remove spare elements from the circuit later on than it is to put them in.  Design  A block diagram of 4-bit ALU The design process involves moving from the specification at the start, to a plan that contains all the information needed to be physically constructed at the end, this normally happens by passing through a number of stages, although in very simple circuit it may be done in a single step. The process normally begins with the conversion of the specification into a block diagram of the various functions that the circuit must perform, at this stage the contents of each block are not considered, only what each block must do, this is sometimes referred to as a \\"black box\\" design. This approach allows the possibly very complicated task to be broken into smaller tasks which may either by tackled in sequence or divided amongst members of a design team. Each block is then considered in more detail, still at an abstract stage, but with a lot more focus on the details of the electrical functions to be provided. At this or later stages it is common to require a large amount of research or mathematical modeling into what is and is not feasible to achieve. The results of this research may be fed back into earlier stages of the design process, for example if it turns out one of the blocks cannot be designed within the parameters set for it, it may be necessary to alter other blocks instead. At this point it is also common to start considering both how to demonstrate that the design does meet the specifications, and how it is to be tested ( which can include self diagnostic tools ). components Finally the individual circuit components are chosen to carry out each function in the overall design, at this stage the physical layout and electrical connections of each component are also decided, this layout commonly taking the form of artwork for the production of a printed circuit board or Integrated circuit. This stage is typically extremely time-consuming because of the vast array of choices available. A practical constraint on the design at this stage is that of standardization, while a certain value of component may be calculated for use in some location in a circuit, if that value cannot be purchased from a supplier, then the problem has still not been solved. To avoid this a certain amount of 'catalog engineering' can be applied to solve the more mundane tasks within an overall design. One area of rapid technology development is in the field of nanoelectronic circuit design. = Costs = Generally, the cost of designing circuits is directly tied to the final circuits' complexity. The greater the complexity (quantity of components and novelty of design), the more hours of a skilled engineer's time will be necessary to create a functional product.  Verification and testing  Once a circuit has been designed, it must be both verified and tested. Verification is the process of going through each stage of a design and ensuring that it will do what the specification requires it to do. This is frequently a highly mathematical process and can involve large-scale computer simulations of the design. In any complicated design it is very likely that problems will be found at this stage and may involve a large amount of the design work be redone in order to fix them. Testing is the real-world counterpart to verification, testing involves physically building at least a prototype of the design and then (in combination with the test procedures in the specification or added to it) checking the circuit really does do what it was designed to.  Prototyping  Prototyping is a big part of doing things that are very difficult. Circuit design forces you to keep going over things and fixing your mistakes. Circuit design is a very rigorous job to do and get done without making a mistake. Circuit designers must test many times to make sure their design works efficiently and most of all is safe for a consumer to buy and use. Prototyping is a big part of any electrical work because it is very meticulous and to the point. Everyone could probably imagine the mistakes that will be made if there is no prototyping going on in the work being done. These workers are getting paid to not just make electrical circuits but to keep everyone who is buying these electrical circuits safe at home. The dangers of not prototyping and sending out a failed electrical circuit will include fires, hot wires, which in turn will make someone not know and cause them to either be burned and at the absolute worst severely hurt.  Results  Every electrical circuit starts with a circuit board simulator of how the things will be put together at the end of the day and also show how the circuit will work virtually. A blueprint is the drawing of the technical design and final product. After all this is done and you use the blueprint to put the circuit together you will get to the results of electrical circuits is quite memorable as the circuit will run anything from a vacuum to a big TV in a movie theater. All of these take a long time and a certain skill not everyone can acquire. The electrical circuit is something most things we need in our everyday lives. = Documentation = Any commercial design will normally also include an element of documentation, the precise nature of this documentation will vary according to the size and complexity of the circuit as well as the country in which it is to be used. As a bare minimum the documentation will normally include at least the specification and testing procedures for the design and a statement of compliance with current regulations. In the EU this last item will normally take the form of a CE Declaration listing the European directives complied with and naming an individual responsible for compliance.

History of Svijany village and brewery Svijany Brewery The first mention of Svijany dates from 1345, when the village was owned by a Cistercian monastery located in Mnichovo Hradi≈°tƒõ. In 1565 the village became the property of Jaroslav of Vartemberk, who built a fortress there, but the brewery was already operating by 1564, and it continued to operate to the benefit of Jaroslav's estate. Upon Jaroslav's death in 1602, the village, fortress, and brewery all passed to Jachym Ondrej Slik. As a rebel against Habsburg rule of Bohemia, he was executed in 1621, and Svijany came under control of the Wallenstein family through 1814. In 1820, Svijany (together with the village and castle of Sychrov) passed to control of the Rohan family. They sold the brewery to their tenant, Antonin Kratochvile, whose family continued to operate it until 1939, at which point they were compelled to sell it back to the Rohan family. In 1945 the brewery was confiscated and nationalized as part of the state-owned North Bohemian Breweries, which was dissolved in 1990, at which point Svijany became part of the state-owned Breweries of Vratislavice nad Nisou. Later threatened with closure due to a sales crisis, Svijany was sold to the newly established Pivovar Svijany (Svijany Brewery Ltd.) in 1998. This was converted to a joint- stock company in 1992 and incorporated into Pra≈æsk√© Pivovary (Prague Breweries) in 1997. At that time Pra≈æsk√© Pivovary had come under control of the English brewer Bass company. In 2002, Pra≈æsk√© Pivovary became part of the Belgium-based Interbrew group, changing their name in 2003 from Pra≈æsk√© Pivovary to Pivovary Staropramen. In 2004, Interbrew merged with AmBev to form Inbev. In 2009, the private equity fund CVC Capital Partners bought all of Anheuser‚ÄìBusch InBev's holdings in Central Europe, renaming the operation StarBev. In 2010, Svijany came under ownership of the Liberec Investment Fund, which bought 55% of the company's shares from StarBev and the remaining 45% from Pivovary Lobkowicz. In September 2011, the brewery's Svijansk√° Knƒõ≈æna (Duchess of Svijany) beer was the winner in the category of special semi-dark and dark beers, in the third annual contest of special and unusual beers at the Znojmo Grape 2011 gastronomic festival. Also in September 2011, Svijany's brewing expert Ladislav ƒåern√Ω and longtime brewery manager Franti≈°ek Hor√°k were inducted into the Czech Brewing and Malting Hall of Fame.

The other is Eihei-ji temple in Fukui Prefecture. Fodor's calls it \\"one of the largest and busiest Buddhist institutions in Japan\\". The temple was founded in 740 as a Shingon Buddhist temple. Keizan, later known as S≈çt≈ç's great patriarch Taiso J≈çsai Daishi, founded the present temple in 1321, when he renamed it S≈çji-ji with the help and patronage of Emperor Go-Daigo. The temple has about twelve buildings in Tsurumi, part of the port city of Yokohama, one designed by the architect It≈ç Ch≈´ta. History Keizan, the temple's founder Giving it the name circa 740, Gy≈çki (668‚Äì749) founded the temple as a Shingon Buddhist temple in Noto, a peninsula on Honshu, Japan's largest island. At that time, the temple was a small chapel within the precincts of a larger Shinto shrine called Morooka Hiko Jinja. By 1296, the temple had grown enough to support a full-time priest and a master ajari named J≈çken was assigned there. The Shrine was relocated 1321 to a new estate and J≈çken went with it. J≈çken entrusted the former temple to Keizan, who then changed the temple from Shingon to a S≈çt≈ç temple named Shogakuzan S≈çji-ji (ji means Buddhist temple in Japanese). The first official abbot, Gasan, was installed months later. However, the original Buddhist deity enshrined, Kannon Bodhisattva, was still enshrined in the temple, and for a time esoteric rituals were still carried out for the temple's patrons. Because Keizan had originally previously founded another temple, Y≈çk≈çji, a complicated rivalry existed between the two temples, leading to open conflict during the Tokugawa period, with S≈çji-ji gradually replacing Y≈çk≈çji as the head temple of Keizan and the lineage of Gikai. This ascension of S≈çji-ji happened in part due to its efforts to send monks out into the countryside, and over generations these monks would often convert small, village chapels (nominally Tendai or Shingon) into full-time temples, which in turn helped S≈çji-ji's network grow. The temple was totally destroyed by fire in 1898. It was rebuilt over a period of several years and, to bring more S≈çt≈ç Zen to eastern Japan, reopened in 1911 in its present location at Tsurumi, Yokohama. S≈çji-ji-soin (the \\"father\\" temple) was built on the original Noto site for monks in training. It sustained considerable damage in the 2007 Noto earthquake. Routine Monk in the corridor which is polished like glass twice a day According to a mid-20th century description, the monks' day begins at 3 a.m. in summer and one hour later in winter. First they practice zazen for two hours, then attend a service and sutra reading for 75 minutes. They later eat breakfast (rice gruel, tea and pickles). Then for 90 minutes they clean the buildings and the grounds. At 8 a.m. they study Chinese poetry and the writings of Zenjis like D≈çgen and Keizan. At 11 a.m. they go to the Butsuden where they perform services or read s≈´tras for visitors. They eat rice and vegetables for lunch and then from 1 to 3 p.m. they return to perform services for visitors. They eat rice gruel for dinner at 5 p.m. From 6 to 8 p.m. the head monk teaches them sutra reading, from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. they return to practice zazen, and then go to sleep at 9 p.m. Abbot The Abbot is called Zenji (), and oversees 200 monks and novices in residence. Egawa Shinzan Zenji holds the positions of Abbot of S≈çji-ji Soin Training Monastery, administrator of S≈çji-ji and Soji-ji Soin, and vice rector, resident priest, assistant head priest, and head priest of related organizations. Temple compound Butsuden The core of the temple consists of seven structures forming the so-called Shichid≈ç garan. The sanmon gate, built in 1969, is, according to the temple's pamphlet the largest such structure in Japan. It≈ç Ch≈´ta (1867‚Äì1954) designed the Daiso-d≈ç or Hatt≈ç, which honors Keizan and other founders, and the Senbutsujo, the hall used as the monks' main training center and to ordain monks. The Sansh≈çkaku, constructed in 1990 and equipped with computers and other modern amenities, is a visitors' center for practice and workshops for lay persons aimed at fulfilling Keizan Zenji's vow to help all sentient beings. The Butsuden (Buddha Hall) enshrines a statue of Gautama Buddha (Shaka Nyorai). The Sh≈çkur≈ç contains the bonsh≈ç bell, the drum, the cloud gong or umpan, and the wooden drum (moppan), used to signal the monks' daily routine. The H≈çk≈ç-d≈ç is used for memorial rites to ancestors of lay persons, for whom the monks perform services. Among outreach activities, the S≈çji Gakuen Academy is a school system where the students study the Buddha's teaching. The academy has a kindergarten, middle school, high school, and university. S≈çji also has child care and a hospital. The Koshakudai building contains the kitchen. The Koshakudai holds the monks' living quarters.

SH 2 was one of the original twenty-five state highways proposed on April 4, 1917, overlaid on top of the Meridian Highway and Gulf Division Highway. From 1919 the routing mostly followed present day Interstate 44 (I-44) from Oklahoma to Wichita Falls, and U.S. Highway 287 (US 287) to Fort Worth. It continued on, routed along present day State Highway 174 and State Highway 6 to Waco. From here, the road divided into two branches, both signed as State Highway 2. The western branch followed the Meridian Highway from Waco, roughly following I-35 to Temple, State Highway 95 to Taylor, U.S. Highway 79 to Round Rock, and I-35 through Austin and San Antonio, and terminating in Laredo. The eastern branch followed the Gulf Division Highway from Waco, routed along present day State Highway 6 through Bryan to Hempstead and follows US 290 into Houston. From there the routing follows US 75 into Galveston. On August 21, 1923, the Gulf Division branch became part of State Highway 6 from Waco to Galveston. SH 2 was rerouted north of Bowie to Oklahoma along current US 81, replacing SH 2D, while the old route to Henrietta was renumbered State Highway 50, the sections from Henrietta to Wichita Falls were already part of State Highway 5, and the section north of Wichita Falls became an extension of State Highway 30. SH 2 was rerouted along current I-35W and I-35 through Hillsboro and concurrent with SH 6 to Waco, replacing SH 2A, with the section of the old route from Meridian to Waco being renumbered as part of SH 67, and the section from Cleburne to Meridian was renumbered as SH 89, and the section from Cleburne to Burleson became part of the new SH 2A. On December 17, 1923, SH 2 was rerouted along current I-35W from Temple to Round Rock, replacing SH 2C, while the old route through Taylor was redesignated as SH 2B. In 1926, US 81 was routed over SH 2 from Oklahoma to Laredo. On March 19, 1928, SH 2 extended south replacing all of SH 12B to Pharr. On March 18, 1929, this extension was changed back to SH 12B. On September 22, 1936, routes called SH 2 Loop through Buda and Kyle were added. On December 22, 1936, routes called SH 2 Bypass through Waco and New Braunfels were added. On December 21, 1938, SH 2 Loop and SH 2 Tap were designated in Ringgold. While the routes were marked concurrently, on September 26, 1939, SH 2 was removed in favor of US 81. The loops, bypasses, and taps became Loop 2 (Waco), Loop 3 (New Braunfels), Loop 4 (Buda), Loop 5 (Kyle), and Loop 19 and Spur 19 (Ringgold). Spur routes The route had numerous spurs and alternate routings during its lifetime. left For the initial June 21, 1917 Texas routing proposal, while the main route continued southwest from Cleburne to Meridian, and then southeast to Waco, State Highway 2A ran southeast from Cleburne to Hillsboro, where it met State Highway 6. On April 23, 1918, the routing of SH 2A remained similar, except the split from the main route happened at Burleson, travelling southeast through Alvarado to Hillsboro. On August 21, 1923, the main route of SH 2 had been rerouted over SH 2A section from Burleson to Itasca, while SH 2A was reassigned to the old alignment of SH 2 from Burleson to Cleburne and to the old alignment of SH 2E to Hillsboro. The old route of SH 2 was renumbered as SH 89 (now SH 174) from Cleburne to Meridian and part of SH 67 (now SH 6) from Meridian to Waco. The SH 2A designation was deleted on September 26, 1939 and was replaced by portions of SH 174, SH 171, and SH 291 (now FM 2719). left State Highway 2B was a spur designated on December 18, 1917, in McLennan County running from Riesel northeast to Mart along an already constructed section of what was previously proposed as part of SH 7. On March 20, 1922, SH 2B extended to the Limestone county line. On December 17, 1923, it was cancelled. SH 2B was designated that same day over a former routing of SH 2 from Round Rock east and north to Temple via Taylor. On April 6, 1932, it was transferred to SH 95 and SH 43 (now US 79). left A more direct route through central Texas between Belton and Round Rock, bypassing Taylor to the west designated as an intercounty highway on January 24, 1918. On July 17, 1918, this was upgraded to a state highway, State Highway 2C, and extended north to Temple. On December 17, 1923, the main route of SH 2 had been rerouted over it. left State Highway 2D was a spur route in north Texas designated on December 16, 1918 branching off the main route at Bowie and travelling north through Ringgold and crossing into Oklahoma. On August 21, 1923, the main route of SH 2 had been rerouted over it, with the old route of SH 2 transferred to SH 50 (now US 287), SH 5 (now US 287), and SH 30 (now US 277). left State Highway 2E was a short connector route between Cleburne and Itasca designated on March 22, 1921, connecting the main route and SH 2A. On August 21, 1923, SH 2E was reassigned to SH 2A. left State Highway 2F was a planned spur routing designated in 1921 or 1922 splitting from the main route in Taylor and travelling south to Elgin. On August 21, 1923, the route was cancelled, and on April 21, 1924 the route was restored as SH 95. A new SH 2F was designated on March 18, 1929, from Bowie to Montague. On April 23, 1929, it extended north to Nocona. On March 19, 1930, SH 2F was renumbered as SH 59.

The Appalachian Regional Commission was formed in 1965 to aide economic development in the Appalachian region, which was lagging far behind the rest of the nation on most economic indicators. The Appalachian region as defined by the Commission includes 420 counties in 13 states, including all 55 counties in West Virginia, the only state whose entire territory is covered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. The Commission gives each county one of five possible economic designations - distressed, at-risk, transitional, competitive, or attainment - with \\"distressed\\" counties being the most economically endangered and \\"attainment\\" counties being the most economically prosperous. These designations are based primarily on three indicators - three-year average unemployment rate, market income per capita, and poverty rate. In 2003, West Virginia had a three-year average unemployment rate of 5.7%, compared with 5.5% nationwide. In 2002, West Virginia had a per capita market income of $17,856, compared with $26,420 nationwide. In 2000, West Virginia had a poverty rate of 17.9%, compared to 12.4% nationwide. Fifteen counties in West Virginia were designated \\"distressed,\\" and sixteen counties were designated \\"at-risk.\\" No county received the \\"attainment\\" designation, and only two - Jefferson and Putnam - were designated \\"competitive.\\" Nineteen counties were designated \\"transitional,\\" meaning they lagged behind the national average on one of the three key indicators. McDowell County had West Virginia's highest poverty rating (and the third highest in the entire Appalachian region), with 37.7% of its residents living below the poverty line. Kanawha County had West Virginia's highest per capita income at $25,170, and Monongalia had West Virginia's lowest unemployment rate at 2.7%.

Energy West Virginia's economy has depended so heavily on its mineral resources and declining coal production and low energy prices in recent years have hurt the state economy. Mining safety and ecological concerns are major challenges to West Virginia, which still produces the majority of the coal used in the U.S. West Virginia is considered a national energy hub, leading the nation in net interstate electricity exports and underground coal mine production, while experiencing a growing natural gas industry as a result of the Great Shale Gas Rush. Overall, it produces 15% of the nation's fossil fuel energy. The state's underground natural gas storage represents 6% of the nation's total, and overall it has 5.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves through 2008 estimates. West Virginia was one of the first states to engage in drilling for oil. Small to medium oil and natural gas fields still exist and are scattered mostly in the Allegheny Plateau and the Cumberland Plateau in an arc throughout the western part of state. The state produces around 180,000 barrels of oil per month, with 23 million barrels of reserves through 2008 estimates. The state has a growing renewable energy portfolio, anchored by chemical and biodiesel manufacturer AC & S, based in Nitro. Through 2009 Columbus-based American Electric Power was the fifth largest employer in the state, followed by Consolidation Coal Company at #9, Allegheny Energy Service Corporation #19, Eastern Associated Coal Corporation #31, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation #40, Hobet Mining, LLC #45, Spartan Mining Company #48, and Elk Run Coal Company, Inc. #50.\\"West Virginia‚Äôs Largest Private Employers for March 2009\\", West Virginia.

Coal is one of the state's primary natural resources, first discovered in the state in 1742. The industry employs 30,000 West Virginians directly, resulting in $2 billion in wages and a $3.5 billion economic impact. West Virginia coal exports declined 40% in 2013, representing a decrease of $2.9 billion in export sales. West Virginia is the largest coal producer east of the Mississippi River, and accounts for 10% of the nation's production. It leads the nation in coal production from underground mines, and has the nation's second largest reserves behind Wyoming. West Virginia has an annual 13 million barrel coal- to-liquid fuel production capacity. It has an extensive network of railroads, and much of the coal is transported by rail. The railways were once one of the largest customers for coal to drive the steam locomotives, but these have been replaced by diesel locomotives. Coal is rarely used now for home heating. Most coal today is used by power plants to produce electricity, both in West Virginia, and in other eastern states. =Alternative energy= The Mountaineer Wind Energy Center was the first wind farm built in the state in 2002.

Agriculture Farming is practiced throughout West Virginia, but in a form different from large extensive cash- crop agriculture elsewhere in the USA. The modal average farm size is a smallish 154 acres. Family and single-owner operation worked 92.7% of the farms, and an astounding 96.9% were totally or partly owned by the operator. On the other hand, only 50.5% of the state's farmers considered farming to be their primary occupation, with a significant number of hours worked elsewhere each year. The rural poverty rate in West Virginia is 20.4%, five points higher than the urban poverty rate. This description of farming portrays an independent and self-sufficient base of small land owners, but also a significant amount of rural poverty. As can be expected in a rugged terrain, raising animals was far more important than growing vegetative crops. Income from animals exceeded income from plants by about 7 to 1, with much of the non-animal income derived from sales of fodder. The chief animals raised were cattle and chickens. In the ridge and valley area along the eastern border near Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, subsidiary valleys are wide and there are some belts of rich soil which are extensively farmed. In 2002, all of the top five counties by agricultural dollar value were located near the eastern Virginia border. In traditional frontier agriculture there was much gathering of wild \\"greens\\" and other vegetation to supplement the diet. One area where this practice is still significant is the gathering of wild North American ginseng, often for the Asian market. Wild gathered ginseng contributed about $2 million in 2000 to the West Virginia economy, a figure larger than many conventional cultivated vegetable and fruit crops. Other wild greens, such as sour dock, lambs quarters, and wild leek (or \\"ramps\\") are also still gathered by many for table use, although today more on the basis of avocation or keeping up traditions than out of necessity. =Forestry= Forestry-based industries employ 15,600 West Virginians through major corporations such as Atlanta-based Georgia Pacific in Mount Hope, Seattle-based Weyerhauser in Heaters, North Carolina-based Coastal Lumber with several locations throughout the state, Virginia-based American Woodmark in Moorefield, and Pittsburgh- based Babcock Lumber Company with multiple locations throughout the state Banking Due to the rural demographics in West Virginia, the state isn't dominated by any major U.S. banks. In fact, the only Big Four bank with any retail banking presence in the state is Chase Bank, and only in the Charleston area. Wesbanco is the largest bank in the state, and the only major bank with a presence throughout the state. City National Bank (West Virginia) also has a significant presence in several areas in West Virginia. Other major banks in the state, but only in certain areas, include Chase, Fifth Third Bank in Charleston and PNC Financial Services in Morgantown.

It is a US federal law on basic labor rights for US government contracts. It was intended to improve labor standards. Contents The Walsh-Healey Act that applies to U.S. government contracts exceeding $15,000 for the manufacturing or furnishing of goods. Walsh-Healey establishes overtime pay for hours worked by contractor employees in excess of 40 hours per week, and sets the minimum wage equal to the prevailing wage as determined by the Secretary of Labor. The law prohibits the employment of youths less than 16 years of age and convicts (only those currently in prison), except under certain conditions. The Act sets standards for the use of convict labor, and job health and safety standards. The Walsh- Healey Act does not apply to commercial items. Background The Act was named for its Congressional sponsors, both Massachusetts Democrats, Senator David I. Walsh and Representative Arthur Healey.Charles H. Trout, Boston, the Great Depression, and the New Deal (NY: Oxford University Press, 1977), 211 The Act was based on Executive Order 6246, issued by President Franklin D.

Accessed 26 January 2014 Architectural history It dates its founding to 1107 after Henry I of England granted the lands and castle to Robert de Beaumont, although Henry Knighton implies that an Anglo- Saxon college of St Mary had existed and Robert merely refurbished it. Robert established it within the castle bailey as a college served by a Dean and 12 Canons (that is, a collegiate church) in honour of the Virgin Mary and All Souls and as a chantry chapel for the souls of him, his family and the first three Norman kings. He endowed this and four other churches with ¬£6 of his income and land in or near the city. However, in 1143 these endowments were all transferred by his son Robert le Bossu, 2nd Earl of Leicester, to his own new Augustinian foundation of Leicester Abbey. The collegiate church retained, or had restored to it a Dean, six Clerks and a Chaplain, along with Robert de Beaumont's grant of 20 shillings for lamps. It also retained parish offerings and most of the tithes. The collegiate nature of the church lasted until the college was disbanded in 1548 under the Chantry act of Edward VI. St Mary de Castro sedilia The early 12th-century church had no aisles, and various parts of these walls survive. It underwent a major expansion in the 1160, with a north aisle, doorways to north and west, and an extension to the chancel. The two doorways provide striking external Norman zigzag decoration, but it is the Sedilia and Piscina in the Chancel extension that Pevsner describes as \\"the finest piece of Norman decoration in the county\\". 13th-century alterations culminated in a major reworking of transepts and south aisle, to create an aisle wider than the nave, providing much more space for local parishioners. Also the huge east window of the south aisle, with ingenious tracery, was created around 1300. The tower was built inside the south aisle, apparently as an afterthought, rising to a Quatrefoil frieze, four decorated pinnacles, and the needlelike spire rising from the battlements. The spire was completely rebuilt in 1783, but retained its crockets and three tiers of lucarnes. The interior was worked on by George Gilbert Scott throughout the 1860s. Spire The church was closed when the spire was found to be unsafe. The 14th-century octagonal spire, having been rebuilt in 1783, had developed 6-metre long cracks in 4 of its faces in September 2013. After inspections by structural engineers, it was deemed at risk of collapse. The severe condition of the spire meant it was demolished, at an estimated cost of ¬£200,000. Over ¬£358,000 has been raised since 2011, however, there are currently insufficient funds to rebuild the spire and repair the tower. Famous events It is rumoured that here, around 1366, Geoffrey Chaucer married Philippa (de) Roet (a lady-in- waiting to Edward III's queen, Philippa of Hainault, and a sister of Katherine Swynford who later (ca. 1396) became the third wife of Chaucer's friend and patron, John of Gaunt). The infant King Henry VI was knighted in the church at Whitsuntide 1426 by his uncle, John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford, the Regent of France (whilst the Parliament of Bats was being held at the Castle). Henry then proceeded to himself dub a further 44 knights on the same occasion, the first of whom was Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York.William Arthur Shaw, The Knights of England, Vol.1, p.130 (London, 1906) William Bickerstaffe, a charitable local schoolmaster and antiquarian, was baptised, buried, and held a seven-year curacy at the church.

A boom barrier, also known as a boom gate, is a bar, or pole pivoted to allow the boom to block vehicular or pedestrian access through a controlled point. Typically the tip of a boom gate rises in a vertical arc to a near vertical position. Boom gates are often counterweighted, so the pole is easily tipped. Boom gates are often paired either end to end, or offset appropriately to block traffic in both directions. Some boom gates also have a second arm which hangs 300 to 400 mm below the upper arm when lowered, to increase approach visibility, and which hangs on links so it lies flat with the main boom as the barrier is raised. Some barriers also feature a pivot roughly half way, where as the barrier is raised, the outermost half remains horizontal, with the barrier resembling an upside-down L when raised. Automatic boom barrier Automatic boom barriers at a level crossing in New South Wales, Australia. Manually-operated boom barrier at a level crossing in Buenos Aires, 1948. There are various technologies for an automatic boom barrier. One of them is electro-mechanical, which is widely used due to its reliability. The other technologies are often manufacturer specific. These electro-mechanical devices come with 24VDC drive units which can run continuously without generating heat, so electro- mechanical boom barriers can be operated continuously and in an intensive duty cycle. =Operation of automatic boom barrier= An automatic boom barrier can be operated through: * Push button * Remote control * RFID tags / RFID reader * Loop detectors * Opto-electronic sensors * Any third party access control device Usage Boom gates are typically found at level crossings, drawbridges, parking facilities, checkpoints and entrances to restricted areas. They are also the usual method for controlling passage through toll booths, and can also be found on some freeway entrance ramps which are automatically controlled to drop to restrict traffic in the event of accident cleanup or road closures without the need to dispatch road workers or law enforcement to use a vehicle to block the way. Some boom gates are automatic and powered, others are manually operated. Manual gates are sometimes hung in the manner of a normal gate (i.e. hinged horizontally). In some places, boom gates are installed across suburban streets as a traffic calming measure, preventing through traffic, while allowing authorised vehicles such as emergency services and buses to take advantage of the shorter and more direct route.

He served as Secretary of State for the Colonies between 1945 and 1946 and as First Lord of the Admiralty between 1946 and 1951. Background Hall was born in Penrhiwceiber, Glamorganshire,son of George Hall, a miner who hailed from Marshfield, Gloucestershire and his wife Anne (n√©e Guard), a native of Midsomer Norton, Somerset. George was the second of six cildren (four sons and two dughters) born between 1880 and 1889. His parents were among the thousands of men and women who migrated to the South Wales Valleys from the West Country in the late nineteenth century, following the expansion of the steam coal trade. George Hall snr. died in 1889 and the young George was compelled to leave Penrhiwceiber elementary schoool at the age of twelve, in order to start work at the Penrikyber colliery. His widowed mother had been left with a large family to support. Early career Following an accident at the colliery which led to a prolonged period of recovery, Hall made up for his relative lack of formal education by engaging in extensive reading and self-education. This may ell have been a factor in his engagement with politics and his election as a Labour member of the Mountain Ash Urban District Council (the first Labour member for the Penrhiwceiber Ward) in 1908. Upon his election, when he defeated sitting Liberal member J.P. Davies by 31 votes, the Aberdare Leader described him as \\"a young man with very sturdy views. He is bent on backing up Labour principles, and with all his life before him looks like shaping into a leader to be dealt with in that party.\\" Hall later served as chaorman of both the Education Committee and the Urban Council itself and he remained a member until 1926. Hall continued to work as a collier until appointed checkweigher in 1911, and then to act as checkweigher Local Agent at the South Wales Miners' Federation until elected to Parliament in 1922. Political career Hall was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Aberdare in 1922 when he won the seat for Labour, defeating Charles Stanton who had held the seat since a 1915 by-election. Stanton had been a militant trade unionist before the war and had won the seat as a pro-war candidate. Hall represented Aberdare from 1922 to 1946 and served under Ramsay MacDonald as Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1929 to 1931. During the 1930s, with the Labour Party numbers in the Commons severely depleted after the 1931 General Election, Hall began to speak on a broader range of subjects having previously focused mainly on issues relating to his mining background. Constituency MP During his long political career, Hall remained closely tied to his native town and valley and was regarded as an effective and approachable constituency MP. He devoted considerable energy to attract alternative industries to the Aberdare area following the decline of coal mining. It was largely through his efforts that a major new employer, Aberdare Cables, established a factoru in the town in 1937 and Hall later became a director of the company. He was also instrumental in establishing Royal Ordnance Factories at Robertstown and Rhigos during the war years as well as the new Hirwaun Trading Estate in 1945. These developments, at least to some ectent, offset the impact of the closure of coal miones from the 1930s onwards. Wartime Government and Cabinet Minister Hall served under Winston Churchill as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1940 to 1942, as Financial Secretary to the Admiralty from 1942 to 1943, and as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1943 to 1945 and under Clement Attlee as Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1945 to 1946. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1942, and on retirement from the House of Commons in 1946, he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Hall, of Cynon Valley in the County of Glamorgan, He then served as First Lord of the Admiralty under Attlee from 1946 to 1951 and as Deputy Leader of the House of Lords from 1947 to 1951. Personal life Lord Hall died in Leicester in November 1965, aged 83, and was succeeded by his son William.

He was also a prominent leader in the temperance movement in the United States in the 1920s until derailed by scandal. H. L. Mencken said in 1934: \\"Six years ago he was the undisputed boss of the United States. Congress was his troop of Boy Scouts, and Presidents trembled whenever his name was mentioned.... But since that time there has been a violent revolution, and his whole world is in collapse.\\"Patterson (1973) Birth and family Cannon was born on November 13, 1864, in Salisbury, Maryland, the son of James and Lydia R. (Pimrose) Cannon. The younger Cannon married Miss Laura Virginia Bennett of Louisa County, Virginia August 1, 1888, who was the daughter of William W. Bennett, President of Randolph-Macon College from 1877-86. Education Cannon was educated in the schools of Salisbury. He earned his A.B. degree from Randolph‚ÄìMacon College in 1884. He earned his A.M. from Princeton University in 1889. The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon Cannon in 1903 by Randolph-Macon College. Princeton University awarded him an honorary D.D. degree. Ordained ministry Cannon was admitted on trial by the Virginia Annual Conference of the M.E. Church, South in 1888. He served the following appointments: Charlotte Circuit (1888‚Äì89), Newport News (1889‚Äì91) and Farmville (1891‚Äì94). He then became the Principal of the Blackstone Female Institute (1894-1911), and of the Blackstone College for Girls (1914-1918). He also served as the editor of the Baltimore-Richmond Christian Advocate, a periodical of his denomination, beginning in 1904. Cannon also was the Secretary of Education of his annual conference for some years. Temperance Movement Cannon was the Superintendent of the Virginia State Anti-Saloon League, beginning in 1909, as well as Legislative Superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League of America. His appointment as bishop in 1918 gave him nationwide influence as he worked zealously to achieve national prohibition through the Eighteenth Amendment. After the death of Anti-Saloon League leader Wayne Wheeler in 1927, Cannon, chairman of the Methodist Board of Temperance and Social Service, emerged as the most powerful leader of the temperance movement in the United States. Mencken said of Cannon that, \\"Congress was his troop of Boy Scouts and Presidents trembled whenever his name was mentioned.\\" Virginia politics Cannon worked closely with the \\"Ring,\\" the dominant conservative faction in Virginia politics, headed by Senator Thomas Staples Martin. The Ring dropped its opposition to prohibition and allowed the state to go dry in 1915, Cannon's first great triumph. Senator Carter Glass became his bitter enemy and started finding irregularities in the bishop's finances, discovering that Cannon, while president of Blackstone College (a small private girls' school in Virginia), had purchased a large quantity of flour in 1917 and, taking advantage of wartime shortages, had resold it not long after at a considerable profit shortly after he became bishop in 1918. Glass kept the information secret. Cannon's national activities in the 1920s reduced his visibility and power in Virginia. In 1921 the old Ring dissolved, replaced by the \\"Byrd Organization\\" of Harry Flood Byrd, Sr., which controlled the state for decades. When the 1928 Democratic Convention chose wet leader Alfred E. Smith for president, Cannon was outraged at this \\"betrayal\\" of the dry cause, and helped organize the Anti-Smith Democratic movement in the South. Cannon strongly criticized Smith, calling him \\"the Cocktail President\\", who lived in the \\"sneering, ridiculing, nullifying...foreign-populated city of New York.\\" Slayton, Robert A.,Empire Statesman : The Rise and Redemption of Al Smith. New York, NY : Free Press, 2001. (p. 313-14) Soon Virginia and upper South states were leaning toward Republican Herbert Hoover Hoover and he did carry them. However the new Virginia machine led by Byrd and Glass supported Smith and decided Cannon had to be destroyed for ruining party unity in the Solid South. Glass sent investigators to look into Cannon's financial dealings. Cannon, who had never been a candidate for political office, assumed Hoover's victory in Virginia made the state ripe for himself, and spread rumors he would challenge Glass for the Senate seat. He supported a coalition of Anti-Smith Democrats and Republicans to win the governorship for Dr. William Moseley Brown of Washington and Lee College. Personality and character One biographer described Cannon as an unpleasant and deceitful person. Although he \\"loved power and prestige, profit and pleasure,\\" Cannon was a distant, dour, and aloof individual. One Anti-saloon League colleague described him as \\"cold as a snake\\"; and another, after working closely with Cannon for forty years, reported having never seen him laugh and rarely seen him even smile. Glass released information that Cannon had been engaged in shady or illegal stock market manipulations. Fellow bishops called for a church investigation. Reports that he had used Methodist church money to support the anti-Smith Democrats in 1928 led to federal investigations. Although Cannon proclaimed his innocence, the disclosure of the wartime hoarding meant that the charges were mounting faster than his friends could deny them. Cannon's preferred candidate was defeated in the contest for the Virginia governorship; meanwhile, Glass kept pushing for more action. In 1930, the bishops decided to bring Cannon to trial before a church court, which voted not to find him guilty by a vote of 54 to 11. Then the national newspapers published private letters between Cannon and his secretary showing they were having an affair before his first wife died. The bishops reopened the case and the church again voted not to convict its bishop, this time from the adultery charges. Still Cannon was not out of legal trouble. In October, 1931, a federal grand jury brought criminal charges against Cannon for violating federal election laws, alleging he borrowed $65,000 for the campaign but kept $48,000 for himself. After a complex series of trials and appeals Cannon was not found guilty in 1934, but the revelations had destroyed his reputation.Patterson 1973 The highly publicized episodes left Cannon's reputation ruined and helped discredit the prohibition movement as immoral, thus contributing to the repeal of prohibition.

Ana Lucia made her first appearance as a guest star in the first season finale, and became part of the main cast for season two. After Oceanic Flight 815 splits in mid-air, the tail section and fuselage crash on opposite sides of a mysterious island. Ana Lucia becomes the leader of the tail section. Flashbacks in her two centric episodes, \\"Collision\\" and \\"Two for the Road\\", show her life as a police officer before the crash. Rodriguez provoked controversy after being stopped by the police for driving under the influence a few weeks before her character was killed, leading to speculation that this was the reason for her death. The producers of Lost stated that Rodriguez was only interested in appearing for one season, so Ana Lucia's death was written in from the beginning. She is shot and killed by Michael Dawson. Arc Prior to the crash Ana Lucia Cortez is an officer in the Los Angeles Police Department who becomes pregnant, but loses the baby after being shot by a suspect at a burglary scene. She spends several months in physical and psychological therapy, and when the suspect is arrested, she refuses to identify him. After his release, she kills him outside a bar. Ana Lucia decides to leave the force and eventually finds work as an airport security guard. She meets Christian Shephard (John Terry) at the airport bar, who asks her to accompany him to Sydney as a bodyguard, however in Sydney the two part ways. Ana Lucia buys a ticket on Oceanic Flight 815 to return to Los Angeles. In a brief flashback in the first season finale, she flirts with Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) at a bar at the airport, unaware he is Christian's son. The pair arrange to continue their conversation during the flight. During the flight the plane splits in half, with the two parts crashing on different sides of an island; Ana Lucia is one of the tail section survivors. The story of how the tail section survivors cope during their first forty-eight days on the Island is shown in \\"The Other 48 Days\\". After landing in the ocean, Ana Lucia does her best to help everyone in need. That night, some of the survivors are kidnapped by the Others, the mysterious inhabitants of the Island, then a few nights later, nine more are taken. During the second raid, Ana Lucia kills one of the Others and finds a list on him, which has descriptions of the victims. Suspecting fellow survivor Nathan (Josh Randall) as a traitor, she moves everyone inland, digs a pit and throws him in it until he confesses. 4 nights later, Goodwin (Brett Cullen) tricks Nathan and kills him. The small group heads further inland, discovering a bunker known as the Arrow. Ana Lucia and Goodwin trek atop a hill, where she tells Goodwin she has worked out he is the real traitor. After a struggle, she impales him on a broken stick, then returns to the group and tells them they are safe. Fellow tail section survivors Libby (Cynthia Watros) and Cindy (Kimberley Joseph) bring Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) to her after discovering him washed up on shore. He breaks free, so Ana Lucia follows and finds Michael (Harold Perrineau) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway). Jin, Michael and Sawyer are thrown into the pit, and Ana Lucia follows, pretending to have also been captured. Once she believes they are fellow 815 survivors she releases them, and they travel to the camp of the other survivors. When they near the camp, Ana Lucia mistakes Shannon (Maggie Grace) for an Other and fatally shoots her. The on-island events of \\"Collision\\" show her guilt after Shannon's death. She has Shannon's lover Sayid (Naveen Andrews) tied up and refuses to let the group move on. After some reasoning from Libby, she reluctantly lets them go. She is invited into a bunker the fuselage survivors found to interrogate a man claiming to be Henry Gale (Michael Emerson), and manages to receive a map to his crashed balloon. She takes Sayid and Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) with her, and eventually discovers the crash site, and the body of the real Henry Gale. In her second centric episode, \\"Two for the Road\\", Ana Lucia attempts to speak to Henry again, but she is assaulted by him and nearly killed. Seeking revenge, she seduces Sawyer and steals his gun. She returns to the hatch and attempts to kill Henry, but is unable to bring herself to do it. She confides in Michael, who offers to kill him on her behalf. But when Ana hands him the gun, he shoots her in the heart, killing her. She is buried next to Libby, who was also killed by Michael. After Ana's death, she makes three further appearances; in a dream to Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) in \\"?\\", as a vision that Hurley (Jorge Garcia) has in \\"The Lie\\", and in a flash sideways in \\"What They Died For\\". Personality Ana Lucia was described by Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer as \\"demanding\\", \\"hostile\\" and a \\"bully\\". She called Ana Lucia a \\"brooding, broken ex-cop\\" with a \\"perpetual scowl\\".

She is \\"street smart\\" and has a \\"speak-her-mind quality\\". Development Rodriguez was only interested in appearing in Lost for one year. In February 2005, Lost producers began looking for a Latina woman in her mid-thirties who would be the leader of the tail section, and a romantic interest for Jack. The agent of Michelle Rodriguez (who was 26 at the time) called the producers, informing them Rodriguez was interested in the role, but only for a year. Rodriguez, producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, and Lost creator J. J. Abrams met, and Rodriguez explained she would only be interested in one season because she was a \\"nomadic spirit\\", but would like to do one \\"kickass arc\\" as she called it. The producers liked her energy, so agreed, with the plan to kill Ana Lucia at the end of the season. Rodriguez felt she had been typecast in tough female roles, so wanted this role to be different.Lindelof, Damon & Cuse, Carlton, (November 21, 2005) \\" Official Lost Audio Podcast #3 \\", ABC. Retrieved on October 24, 2008. Ana Lucia was planned to start as a tough character, because that is what the audience would expect, then the layers of the character would be gradually peeled back. Rodriguez described Ana Lucia as an \\"animalistic type creature... tamed by the Island.\\" They reconstructed the character slightly to fit what they liked about Rodriguez, such as making her more \\"street smart\\" with a \\"speak-her-mind quality.\\" Ana Lucia made her first appearance in the penultimate episode of season one, in order to set up her character becoming part of the cast in the next season. All Rodriguez was told about her character was both she and her mother were in the police force. Ana Lucia's style of leadership deliberately contrasts Jack's; Jack is a reluctant leader, whereas Ana Lucia quickly takes charge on her own. In her early appearances, Ana Lucia is shown to be very tough, so the flashbacks in \\"Collision\\", where it is revealed she lost her baby, were used to show a softer side to her.\\"Lost on Location - Collision\\".

When it came time to kill off Ana Lucia, the character of Libby was killed at the same time to create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman.Borod Wright, Liz, (May 4, 2006) \\"Lost Star Michelle Rodriguez Still Growing Up ,\\" ABC News.

She added Ana Lucia murdering Shannon, \\"the least deserving of sympathy of all the previously known survivors\\", made fans hate Ana Lucia even more.

Big Brother ceased publication in 2004. No subject was taboo. Early articles featured step by step ways to commit suicide and rip-off schemes such as how to make a fake ID. They would often use odd gimmicks like printing the magazine in different sizes, packaging it in a cereal box, and throwing in items like trading cards and a cassette tape. Early writers were Sean Cliver, Earl Parker (Thomas Schmidt), Jeff Tremaine, Marc McKee, Mike Ballard, Pat Canale, and others.Skimthefat.com They also released a few videos, including \\"Shit\\", then \\"Number 2\\", with a few stunts and pranks, but the videos were mostly skateboarding-oriented. A documentary on the magazine's history, Dumb: The Story of Big Brother Magazine premiered on Hulu on June 3, 2017. The documentary featured interviews with Bam Margera, Steve-O, Johnny Knoxville, Spike Jonze, Jeff Tremaine, and others who were involved in the magazine's creation.  History  The magazine contained mostly articles about skateboarding, as well as some nudity, stunts, pranks, and random ramblings from its staff. Its later days were characterized by the clever wordplay of editors Dave Carnie and Chris Nieratko.Chrisnieratko.com The magazine was purchased by Larry Flynt in 1997. After Flynt began publishing the magazine, the nudity was toned down or scrapped altogether, though the vulgarity remained. In 1998, Laura Schlessinger was in Beach Access, a Costa Mesa surf shop, with her son when she began perusing Big Brother. Schlessinger deemed the magazine to be \\"stealth pornography\\" and said so on her radio show. When Tom Moore, the owner of Beach Access, publicly denied that she found pornography in his store, Schlessinger sued Moore for lying and claimed that his denial had hurt her reputation. When Schlessinger's case went to court, the judge said it was a frivolous lawsuit and dismissed it. Moore's $4M countersuitPeople.com, Dr. Laura: Surf's Up against Schlessinger, lodged for hurting the reputation of his store (defamation) was allowed to stand.Judge Dismisses Dr. Laura Schlessinger Suit Against Beach Access Owner The suit has since been settled, but terms of the settlement have not been revealed.People.com, Dr. Laura Makes Nice Behind the scenes and off the record, Moore's lawyers and friends claimed victory, indicating the settlement was \\"about the amount of a moderately priced Orange County home\\" (at the time, $650,000 to $2 million). In one of the most bizarre episodes of the magazine's history, the subscriber list for Big Brother got mixed up with Taboo, one of Larry Flynt's hardcore magazines: Big Brother subscribers were sent pornography, and those who subscribed to Taboo got a skate magazine. This incident was parodied on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in which one of the band members was delivered an issue of Big Brother live on stage, suggesting that he subscribed to Taboo and received it in error. The magazine was unexpectedly dropped by Larry Flynt publications in February 2004. In early 2008, it was announced on Jackassworld.com that Big Brother would be returning in a digital format. Volume 1 No. 1 of KingShit Magazine, based in Toronto, Ontario was released May, 2009. Dave Carnie is the editor-at-large and Chris Nieratko is a contributing editor.

The ship was named in honour of Admiral Guillermo Brown, the Father of the Argentine Navy. Design and construction Almirante Brown was built by Odero in Genoa (Italy), laid down 27 November 1927, launched on 11 August 1929, and completed 11 July 1931. Her total displacement was 6,800 tons. The ship was broadly similar to the Italian but was armed with three twin 7.5-in gun turrets as against four twin 8-inch guns. Another important difference was the repositioning of the boilers, which gave the ship a single funnel. On trials the cruiser reached its contracted speed of . As completed the ship had a short funnel but it was subsequently raised. During the Second World War the ship finally received the catapult which had been included in the original design. The catapult and crane were carried on the centreline between the funnel and mainmast, with two Grumman floatplanes. When built six twin 100-mm anti-aircraft guns were mounted at forecastle deck level but these were later replaced by twin 40-mm Bofors guns. Almirante Brown was decommissioned on 27 June 1961 and sold for breaking up in Italy in 1962.

It is developed by the Evernote Corporation, headquartered in Redwood City, California. The app allows users to create notes, which can be text, drawings, photographs, audio, or saved web content. Notes are stored in notebooks and can be tagged, annotated, edited, searched, given attachments, and exported. Evernote is cross-platform, for Android, iOS, macOS, and Microsoft Windows. It is free to use with monthly usage limits, and offers paid plans for expanded or lifted limits.  Company  After being founded in 2000 by Russian-American computer entrepreneur Stepan Pachikov, EverNote Corporation ('EverNote' stylized with a capital 'N' by then) started marketing software for Windows desktop PCs, Tablet PCs and handheld devices like the handwriting recognition software ritePen and the notetaking and web clipping application EverNote (also with a capital 'N'), a Windows application which stored notes on an 'infinite roll of paper'.EverNote - Products Evernote.com Under the new CEO Phil Libin, the company shifted its focus to the Web, smartphones and also the Apple Mac, starting with Evernote (now with lower- case 'n') 3.0 in 2008. The Evernote Web service launched into open beta on June 24, 2008 and reached 11 million users in July 2011. In October 2010, the company raised a US$20 million funding round led by DoCoMo Capital with participation from Morgenthaler Ventures and Sequoia Capital.Reisinger, Don. Evernote Secures $20 Million in Investment Round. CNET News, October 19, 2010.

On May 7, 2013, TechCrunch reported that Evernote launched Yinxiang Biji Business into the Chinese market at the Global Mobile Internet Conference. Linda Kozlowski was named the Chief Operating Officer of Evernote in June 2015, after more than two years with the company, but left before the end of the year. Libin stepped down as CEO in July 2015 and was replaced by former Google Glass executive Chris O'Neill, but remained Executive Chairman. In October 2015, the Evernote Corp. announced that the company was laying off 18 percent of its workforce and would be closing three out of 10 global offices.Evernote is in deep trouble ‚Äî Business Insider In September 2016, Libin stepped down as Executive Chairman to focus on other business ventures. In February 2017, CEO O'Neill stated in a blog post that the business was now cash-flow positive.

Architecture =Coding and versions= In 2010, the programming language used to write Evernote's software was changed from C# for version 3.5 to C++ in version 4.0 to improve performance. =Data entry= As well as the keyboard entry of typed notes, Evernote supports image capture from cameras on supported devices, and the recording of voice notes. In some situations, text that appears in captured images can be recognized using OCR and annotated. Evernote also supports touch and tablet screens with handwriting recognition. Evernote web-clipping plugins are available for the most popular Internet browsers that allow marked sections of webpages to be captured and clipped to Evernote. If no section of a webpage has been highlighted, Evernote can clip the full page. Evernote also supports the ability to e-mail notes to the service, allowing for automated note entry via e-mail rules or filters.Westfall, Jonathan. Scan Directly from your Office to Evernote JonWestfall.com, September 28, 2010. (Accessed July 18, 2011) Where suitable hardware is available, Evernote can automatically add geolocation tags to notes. As of November 2018, Evernote Pro integrates directly with Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Teams, and Slack, and Evernote Pro adds an integration with Salesforce. All versions of Evernote also support integrations through IFTTT and Zapier. In 2013, Evernote deprecated its direct integration with Twitter in favor of these third-party services. File:Evernote Information Model.pngInformation model for Evernote File:Information Type Note.pngInformation type model for notes in Evernote File:Information Type User.pngInformation type model for users in Evernote Data storage and access On supported operating systems, Evernote allows users to store and edit notes on their local machine, using a SQLite database in Windows. Users with Internet access and an Evernote account can also have their notes automatically synchronized with a master copy held on Evernote's servers. This approach lets a user access and edit their data across multiple machines and operating system platforms, but still view, input and edit data when an Internet connection is not available. However, notes stored on Evernote servers are not encrypted. Where Evernote client software is not available, online account-holders can access their note archive via a web interface or through a media device. The service also allows selected files to be shared for viewing and editing by other users. The Evernote software can be downloaded and used as \\"stand-alone\\" software without using the online portion of an Evernote account (online registration is required for initial setup, however), but it will not be able to upload files to the Evernote server, or use the server to synchronize or share files between different Evernote installations. Also, no image or Image-PDF (Premium only) recognition and indexing will take place if the software is used entirely offline. Accounts Evernote Premium gift card. Evernote is a free online service that allows users to upgrade to Plus*, Premium, or a Business account. Free, Plus* and Premium Evernote accounts have a maximum limit of 100,000 notes and 250 notebooks. Basic customers can upload 60 MB of data each month. Plus* customers get a 1 GB upload limit, offline notes on mobile devices, as well as passcode lock for mobile devices. Emails can also be sent to their Evernote account. Premium subscribers are granted 10 GB of new uploaded data every month, faster word recognition in images, heightened security, PDF annotation, Context, where notes and news articles can be seen, which are related to the open note and the ability to search text within PDF documents. They also receive additional options for notebook sharing. Each of free, Plus* and Premium account types allow notebook sharing with other Evernote users; however, the accounts are distinguished by editing capabilities. In regards to shared notebooks, editing permissions to non-paid account holders may only be granted to premium Evernote subscribers.Premium plan information Evernote.com The free service does not make files available offline on iOS and Android devices; while sometimes they are available from cache, editing these files can cause conflicts when synchronizing. With the full version of Evernote Business, users sync and view work documents through a variety of platforms, such as Mac, iPhone and iPads, Web, Windows and Android Devices. Files that can be uploaded include spreadsheets, presentations, notes and design mock ups. In addition, administrators can monitor company progress and individual employees through the admin console. In June 2016, Evernote announced the limitation for users of its free Basic account to two devices per year and raised prices for its premium service tiers. Non-paying Evernote users are able to sync notes between two devices. Plus* lets users store notes offline and upload up to 1GB files, while Premium adds document-parsing features and 10GB of additional storage. From early April 2018, Evernote Plus was no longer available for purchase, however, users who currently have the Plus subscription can maintain it as long as their subscription is still active. Supported platforms Original Evernote for iOS icon Evernote clients are available for Android, BlackBerry (including BlackBerry Playbook), Google Wave, iOS (iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch), macOS, Maemo, Microsoft Windows, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, and WebOS platforms as well as a beta for Symbian S60 5th Edition. Additionally, portable versions of Evernote are available for flash drives and U3 drives. There is currently no officially supported native client for BSD or Linux, but the company provides an API for external Linux clients. There is substantial variation in supported features on different platforms.

This is a stand-alone work, not part of any of Vance's numerous novel sequences. The term \\"space opera\\" is typically used in science fiction literature to connote interstellar adventures, clashes of spacefleets and galactic empires. Vance's novel is instead about an opera company touring in outer space.  Plot summary  On Earth, audiences are entranced by the musical entertainments staged by an alien troupe, the Ninth Company of the planet Rlaru. Dame Isabel Grayce (one of a long line of formidable society matrons in Vance's works) has sponsored the entertainments; when the Ninth Company disappears without a trace, she proposes to recoup her losses and bring culture to the wastes of space by forming an opera company which Adolph Gondar (the discoverer of Rlaru) will pilot on a tour of suitable planets, with Rlaru as ultimate destination. Singers, orchestra, a British conductor (Sir Henry Rixon) are engaged; an argumentative critic, Bernard Bickel, who thinks the Ninth Company were fakes, is hired as musical consultant. Dame Isabel's indolent and aptly named nephew Roger Wool (one of a long line of Vancian put-upon nephews) tags along also, smuggling his new girlfriend Madoc Roswyn, who claims to be a simple girl from Merioneth in Wales, aboard the ship as a stowaway. Like many of Vance's works, the novel is a picaresque; Gondar has his own reasons for not returning to Rlaru, and diverts the company half way round the galaxy, with various adventures or humiliations occurring on the different planets they touch down on. (There are some similarities with Vance's later novel Showboat World, which has a travelling company presenting performances of Shakespeare's Macbeth to generally uncomprehending audiences along an immense river on a distant planet.) Over the course of the voyage, the company stages several celebrated works, such as Beethoven's Fidelio, Mozart's The Magic Flute and Cos√¨ fan tutte, Rossini's The Barber of Seville and Wagner's Tristan und Isolde and Flying Dutchman. These are performed before various human or non- human audiences, the libretti and costumes sometimes having to be adapted to become understandable to alien cultures. On the whole, due to such cultural disparities, their reception is far from that expected by Dame Isabel: on a penal colony planet, for instance, the performances are made the cover for a jail-break; on a planet inhabited by a race priding themselves on their musical talents, the productions are vetted by an artistic inspector and the company is fined for every unresolved dissonance in the scores performed; on still another, the performance is mistaken for a trade exhibition and the aliens attempt to buy some of the singers. While Gondar is confined to his cabin, apparently insane, Madoc Roswyn induces his deputy to take the ship to the distant planet Yan. It emerges that her remote ancestors inhabited a land now sunk beneath the Bay of Biscay whose people had colonized that planet and there developed a high civilization. (Here we detect the germ of Vance's later major fantasy trilogy Lyonesse, the heroine of whose third volume is named Madouc.) A group had returned to Earth thousands of years later, but their spacecraft was destroyed and they were forced to settle in Wales, ever intending to return to Yan. Madoc is their last descendant. She is disappointed by what she finds: Yan's cities are dust and its folk have reverted to barbarism, hiding in the forests. Although the company present Debussy's Pell√©as to try to establish communication with the unseen inhabitants, they barely escape with their lives. Eventually the voyage ends at Rlaru. It turns out that Gondar had abducted the Ninth Company from the planet; he is suitably punished by the natives, who demonstrate a capacity to creatively manipulate illusion and environment far beyond anything their Earth visitors can achieve. They listen to several operas with mounting boredom, but are utterly entranced by an impromptu washboard jazz band formed by some members of the crew, which has been a source of annoyance to the opera-lovers throughout the voyage. (Vance was at one time a jazz musician.) Dame Isabel returns to Earth, chastened but determined not to admit it; Roger marries Madoc Roswyn and begins writing a book describing the voyage.

It is biodegradable condensation polymer based on the amino acid aspartic acid. Polymerization The polymerization reaction is an example of a step-growth polymerization to a polyamide and in one practical procedure aspartic acid is simply heated to 180 ¬∞C resulting in water release and the formation of a poly(succinimide). In the subsequent step, this polymer is reacted with sodium hydroxide in water, which hydrolyzes one of the two amide bonds of the succinimide ring to form a sodium carboxylate. The remaining amide bond is thus the linkage between successive aspartate units. Each aspartate unit is identified as Œ± or Œ≤ according to which carbonyl of it is part of the polymer chain. The Œ± form has one carbon in the backbone in addition to the carbonyl itself (and a two-carbon sidechain) whereas the Œ≤ form has two carbons in the backbone in addition to the carbonyl itself (and a one-carbon sidechain). This reaction gives a sodium poly(aspartate) copolymer composed of approximately 30% Œ±-linkages and 70% Œ≤-linkages. Synthesis of sodium poly(aspartate) Uses This material can be synthesized in an environmentally friendly way and is biodegradeable, thus it is a green alternative to several materials such as sodium polyacrylate used in disposable diapers and agriculture. In addition and due to its water-solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor.

(IFABC website) A General Assembly of members is held every second year since 1963. Assemblies have been held in New York City, Paris, Munich, Copenhagen, London, Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, Stockholm, Tokyo, Toronto, Buenos Aires, Lucerne, New Delhi, Berlin, Washington, D.C., Seville, Sydney, and Kuala Lumpur. The aim of the IFABC is to work with national and international organisations that constructively support the goals and work of its members. The Federation facilitates the exchange of experience and best practice between member organisations. Members organisations are committed to working towards a common goal of supporting transparency and accountability in the media data used for the purpose of evaluation of media channels by advertisers and media agencies.  History  The first organised effort to verify circulation claims came in the United States. In 1914, advertisers, advertising agencies and publishers joined in a voluntary cooperative program, based on a common interest in reliable circulation data, to form the Audit Bureau of Circulations. In the 1920s and 1930s, several other countries established similar organisations. As advertising and publishing became more important in international marketing, bureaux to verify circulation were organised in various countries. IFABC was founded in 1963. During the 13th International Advertising Association Congress held in Stockholm that year, audit bureaux leaders established a Working Committee to develop a set of By-laws. These were adopted informally by delegates of ten organisations on May 29, 1963. Now there are audit bureaux in countries across the world, with the most established offering independent certification for more than 75 years. During the second half of the last century, many new audit bureaux were founded in countries where media trading was growing in sophistication and there was a clear need for greater accountability. Today, with media markets evolving faster than ever, this demand continues. Self regulation is the guiding principle for every IFABC member. This is based on the conviction that whenever an industry is able to regulate itself with active involvement of al stakeholders, control by government is unnecessary. The IFABC system of published standards, voluntary acceptance of standards by media, impartial circulation audits, and the resulting reliable data, continues to be a constructive, and vital, force in international and national marketing. Every second year, a General Assembly of members is held. Assemblies have been held in New York, Paris, Munich, Copenhagen, London, Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, Stockholm, Tokyo, Toronto, Buenos Aires, Lucerne, New Delhi, Berlin, Washington, D.C., Seville, Sydney, Kuala Lumpur, Bern, London, Cancun and Seoul. An Important step for the IFABC was the formation of the Global Web Standards Group in 1997, making the IFABC an early pioneer of looking at developing digital standards across boundaries. Membership They are four types of members. *Full members are members with full voting rights and use of the logo and slogan and comply with the basic rules and procedures as required by the IFABC Constitution and Bylaws. *Affiliate Members are members that do not fully comply with the IFABC Constitution and Bylaws but are sufficiently compliant to be welcomed into the body with full participation. *Associate Membership is for companies who are closely aligned to the industries IFABC serves, for example paper supplies. *Reciprocity Membership is for other media industry bodies who have similar interests to IFABC and are closely allied with us in terms of associated initiatives . Only full members have full voting rights and use of the IFABC logo and slogan.  Vision and Mission  The International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Certification (IFABC) is a voluntary cooperative federation of industry-sponsored organizations established in nations throughout the world to verify and report facts about the circulations of publications and related data. According to the IFABC web page, their objectives are: * To encourage and facilitate the exchange of experience between the member organizations. * To work towards greater standardisation and uniformity in the reporting of circulations and other data. * To encourage the establishment of an audit bureau of circulations in countries where such a bureau does not exist. * To cooperate with national and international organizations in any way connected with members' activities.  Print metrics  A print circulation audit system is a combination of rules, regulations, and protocols - backed by a team of people, operations and infrastructure, and independent verification. Its aim is to be capable of delivering to the marketplace a true picture of the circulation performance of the audited publications. Only publishers possess the real and full picture of their title's circulation performance. By creating an ABC and its audit system, the advertising industry creates a mirror that most accurately reflects this performance. The picture must be clear, credible, understandable and unbiased. The data reported must be 100 percent reliable, comparable to similar other media indicators, and delivered in a timely manner. The technical essence of the circulation audit is to independently verify the documentation and accounting of the publishers (in general by chartered public accountants), which act as proof of the different circulation types and quantities of a given publication, in a given time period. The subject of the audits are the publishers, while the advertisers and media agencies, as well as the public, at large, are the consumers of the audited data. The role of the publishers is to take part in the audits, while the role of the other two other arms of the market is to formulate their needs relative to the data, which will be audited and published, and to manage the audit standards and processes. The three parties should work together on establishing the most practical, valid and reliable audit system for a given market.

Family life Palmer was born in Long Sutton in Somerset, the eldest son of William Palmer and his wife, Mary, the daughter of William Isaac of Sturminster Newton in Dorset. Both were Quaker families. His wife was a first cousin of Cyrus Clark and James Clark who founded the shoemakers C. & J. Clark. His father died in 1826, and he was educated at Sidcot School near Weston-super-Mare, before becoming an apprentice to his uncle, who was a miller and confectioner. He married Elizabeth Sarah Meteyard in 1850. They had had six sons and four daughters. One daughter Emily married the evolutionary biologist Edward Bagnall Poulton, whilst his daughter Alice married the physiologist Augustus Desire Wallace. His wife died in 1894, and he died of a stroke at home three years later. Business Palmer went into business with a cousin Thomas Huntley in 1841, after Thomas's father Joseph Huntley, the founder of the business in 1822, was forced to retire through ill-health, and it became apparent that Thomas Huntley did not have his father's good sense of business.Reading History Trail. Huntley and Palmers , Retrieved 30 January 2006 The firm was renamed Huntley & Palmers. Whilst it was Joseph Huntley's innovation in the introduction of the biscuit tin and in the sale of biscuits to stage coach travellers that created the business, George Palmer is generally credited with making it a major Victorian success through industrial manufacturing techniques, and by using the railways for distribution. With the engineer William Exall, Palmer invented new machinery to manufacture biscuits on an industrial scale. When Thomas Huntley died, in 1857, George Palmer was joined in the business by two brothers, William Isaac Palmer and Samuel Palmer. The turnover of the business had increased from ¬£2,700 in 1841 to ¬£125,000 in 1857. He was later joined by his son, George William Palmer. Two other sons of George and four of his nephews, sons of Samuel, later became partners in the business. By the time of his death in 1897, the business had an annual turnover of more than ¬£1.25 million, selling around 23,000 tons of biscuits each year. The company claimed to be the largest manufacturer of biscuit in the world. Politics In addition to his business career, George Palmer was involved in politics. He served in the local council in Reading from 1850, was as mayor of Reading in 1857‚Äì58, and represented the town in parliament. He served as Liberal Member of Parliament for the Parliamentary Borough of Reading from 1878 until 1885, when the two-member seat was reduced to one member. Palmer stood as a candidate for the new constituency of Newbury in 1885, one of three created from the former county seat of Berkshire, but he was not elected. His son George William Palmer was twice elected to represent Reading, serving from 1892 to 1895 and from 1898 to 1904. Palmer's country estate was Marlston House in Bucklebury. He donated the 49 acres of land to Reading which became Palmer Park. Statue Broad Street, c. 1890 by Henry Taunt The statue of George Palmer which now stands in Palmer Park was by sculptor George Blackall Simonds and originally sited in Broad Street. It was unveiled in 1891, the same day that Palmer Park opened. The same year, Palmer was given the freedom of Reading, and declined the offer of a baronetcy. The statue was moved c. 1930 to its current location as it caused traffic congestion.Statue of George Palmer, Reading.

All Media Network  All Media Network (AMN), formerly known as All Media Guide (AMG) and AllRovi, was an American company that owned and maintained AllMusic, AllMovie, AllGame (until its closure in 2014), SideReel and Celebified. The company was founded in 1990 by popular-culture archivist Michael Erlewine. All Media Network offices were located in San Francisco, California, and Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States, and several other locations across the country. All Music Guide (now AllMusic) was launched in 1991. Later in 1994 the All Movie Guide (now AllMovie) was launched and in 1998 the All Game Guide (later AllGame‚Äîdefunct in 2014). = History = All Media Network was founded in Big Rapids, Michigan in 1990 by Michael Erlewine. With the All Music Guide the aim was to \\"[compile] discographic information on every artist who's made a record since Enrico Caruso gave the industry its first big boost\\", which launched in 1991. They expanded with the All Movie Guide (now AllMovie) in 1994, and then the All Game Guide (now AllGame) in 1998. moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1999 to take advantage of the \\"rich talent pool\\". AMG was a business unit within Alliance Entertainment Corporation from 1996 until early 2005. Alliance was acquired in 1999 by Yucaipa Companies, a multibillion-dollar fund based in California. Macrovision (now TiVo) announced on November 6, 2007 that it had agreed to purchase All Media Guide for a reported $102 million; $72 million in cash was paid up front, and $30 million in contingent payments were made one year later. For a time, all of the guides were controlled by Rovi's nameservers and combined access to the All Music and All Movie Guides was provided via AllRovi.com from 2011 until 2013. In 2013, Rovi sold consumer access of the content to the newly established All Media Network, LLC, but retained control of licensing the content to other businesses. The overall website is allmedianetwork.com (previously allmediaguide.com and allrovi.com). Rovi sold the consumer access to them to newly established All Media Network, LLC in 2013, while retaining ownership and maintenance of the content itself. The AllGame section of the site was shut down on December 12, 2014. On April 16, 2015 Blinkx Plc acquired All Media Network and rebranded the website under the new unified RhythmOne Group banner.  Properties  = AllMusic = AllMusic logo AllMusic is an online database which provides access to information about songs, albums, musicians, bands, and musical styles alongside staff-authored news, reviews, biographies, ratings and recommendations. The content was initially published in book form in 1991 as the All Music Guide, and is now freely available to the public for online reference and information as well as available via licensing for point-of-sale systems, media players, and online music stores.  Guide series  RhythmOne also produces the AllMusic guide series that includes the All Music Guide to Jazz and the All Music Guide to the Blues. Vladimir Bogdanov is the president of the series. = AllMovie = AllMovie logo AllMovie, launched in 1994 as the All Movie Guide, provides access to information about actors, films, and filmmakers with staff-authored news, reviews, ratings, and recommendations. It offers limited information about Television productions, focused mainly on those released on DVD. Like AllMusic, this content is also available via licensing to point-of-sale systems, media players, and online stores. = AllGame = AllGame logo AllGame, active between 1998 and 2014 as the All Game Guide, offered information and reviews about many console, handheld, arcade, and PC games released in the US. The site started in February 1998 with the goal of becoming the most comprehensive game database available. In a farewell message on their site, the staff noted that they \\"didn't all know exactly what we were doing in those early days but it was an exciting time to be helping build an online game database before the Internet exploded with numerous websites dedicated to video games.\\" = SideReel = SideReel logo SideReel, launched in 2007, is a TV community site which provides information about TV shows and episodes. = Celebified = Celebified offers celebrity news and interviews and started in 2012.  Operations  = Business model = The AllMusic database is also used by several generations of Windows Media Player and Musicmatch Jukebox to identify and organize music collections. Windows Media Player 11 and the integrated MTV Urge music store have expanded the use of AllMusic data to include related artists, biographies, reviews, playlists and other data. All Media Network licenses large databases of metadata about movies, video games, audio books, and music releases from Rovi Corporation and publishes them online for consumer use. This includes credits, and staff- written biographies, reviews, ratings, and recommendations as well as categories such as theme or mood. Rovi also makes this content available for point of sale systems in stores globally, for CD and DVD recognition in software media players such as Windows Media Player and Musicmatch Jukebox, and for providing content for a variety of websites including iTunes, Pandora, and Spotify. Formerly, All Media Guide sold print compilations of its information. = Content and data management = RhythmOne's database was initially set up by Vladimir Bogdanov to hold the information of Erlewine's many lists. Information in the database is licensed and used in point-of-sale systems by some music retailers, includes the following: * Basic data: names, genres, credits, copyright information, product numbers. * Descriptive content: styles, tones, moods, themes, nationalities. * Relational content: similar artists and albums, influences. * Editorial content: biographies, reviews, rankings. The company claims to have the largest digital archive of music, including about six million digital songs, as well as the largest cover art library, with more than half a million cover image scans. Adware controversy A lengthy criticism of Blinkx by Harvard Business School Associate Professor Ben Edelman, published in January 2014, sought to prove that Blinkx continued the adware operations of two companies it acquired, Prime Visibility Media Group and Zango, and was defrauding advertisers. Blinkx responded point-by-point in March 2014, stating that it did not install adware without user consent and that they did not wholly acquire Zango or its assets. An earlier, 2009 blog post by Ken Smith, Zango co-founder and former CTO, supported Edelman's assertion that Blinkx acquired all of Zango's assets. Forbes contributor Peter Cohan claimed that Edelman's post caused a massive drop in blinkx's stock price, and further noted that Blinkx's initial, now- deleted corporate response on 30 January 2014 was largely an attack on Edelman's methods, rather than on the content of his analysis. However, New York Times blogger Mark Scott theorized that Edelman's undisclosed client(s), who funded his research on Blinkx, may have been hedge funds who profited from shorting the drop in Blinkx's stock price. Endelman published further research in April 2014, claiming that Blinkx offered users deceptive software installers and used deceptive pop-up advertisements. He continued to defend his claim that Blinkx purchased all of Zango's assets, including its physical headquarters, and argued that an FTC order against Zango in 2007 may still apply to Blinkx. A section of the post co-authored with digital fraud investigation consultant Wesley Brandi also defended and furthered his initial claims that Blinkx was defrauding its advertising affiliates.

The diocese is subordinate to the Archdiocese of Pamplona y Tudela.\\"Diocese of Jacao\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved November 30, 2016\\"Diocese of Jaca\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016 Jaca originally belonged to the diocese of Huesca, but after the Moorish conquest of Huesca in 713 its bishops, (known as the itinerant \\"Bishops of Aragon\\"), moved to Aragon. The episcopal see was established in Jaca during 1063‚Äì96, then moved back to Huesca after king Pedro I of Aragon retook the city from the Moors in November 1096. The diocese of Jaca was created in 1572, carved out of the diocese of Huesca. The city of Jaca, capital of the mountainous comarca of Jacetania, lies some 820 metres above sea-level on the left bank of the Aragon River, a tributary of the Ebro, . Jaca cathedral is dedicated to [Saint Peter]. Consecrated in the late 11th century and altered in the 15th‚Äì18th centuries, it is Romanesque in its architectural style. The church of San Adri√°n de Sasabe, in Sasabe (also in Huesca province) was an earlier diocesan cathedral. A religious and civil festival is held on the first Friday of May, locally referred to as \\"Primer Viernes de Mayo\\", in memory of a victory said to have been won over the Moors in the 8th century by Count Aznar aided by the women of Jaca. It is celebrated with a solemn procession in which the entire cathedral chapter takes part. There are many hermitages around Jaca, but none more interesting than that of San Juan de la Pe√±a, ensconced within a cave in the Pyrenees. This shrine was also a monastery, royal mausoleum and -allegedly- one of the many hiding places of the Holy Grail in the middle ages. It continues to be a stop along the Camino de Santiago for many pilgrims and tourists. In another cave, dedicated to La Virgen de la Cueva, locals gather annually to pay homage to \\"Our Lade of the Cave\\", a venerated shrine where Garc√≠ Xim√©nez was proclaimed first King of Sobrarbe in the 8th century.  History  Jaca was once the capital of the Iacetani, a tribe mentioned by Strabo. This territory was the scene of battles between Sertorius and Pompey and later between Pompey's son Sextus and Caesar's generals. =Itinerant bishops of Aragon (713‚Äì1063)= Ecclesiastically, Jaca originally belonged to the Diocese of Huesca. When in 713 the town of Huesca was seized by the Moors, the bishop fled and the diocese was directed from Aragon by itinerant bishops, sometimes called bishops of Aragon, sometimes bishops of Huesca or Jaca, who lived either at Jaca or in the neighbouring monasteries of San Juan de la Pe√±a, San Pedro de Siresa and San Adri√°n de Sasabe. Among the itinerant bishops of Aragon were: * c. 920: I√±igo * c. 922: Ferriolus * 933‚Äì947: Fortu√±o * 971‚Äì978: Aureolus * c. 981: At√≥n * 1011‚Äì1036: Mancius * 1036‚Äì1057: Garc√≠a * 1058‚Äì1075: Sancho =Jaca as seat of the bishops of Huesca (1063‚Äì1096)= * 1058‚Äì1075: Sancho * 1076‚Äì1086: Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez * 1087‚Äì1097: Peter A council held at Jaca in 1063 determined anew the boundaries of the Diocese of Huesca, which thereafter included the present dioceses of Huesca, Jaca and Barbastro, as well as a part of the Diocese of L√©rida. Jaca was then made the permanent seat of the diocese. At the same time Sancho was appointed Bishop of Huesca (1058‚Äì1075) and hastened to request the Pope Alexander II to confirm the decisions of the council. In the same year of 1063, however, King Sancho Ramirez of Aragon (1063‚Äì1094) had won back from the Moors the city of Barbastro, and had granted it to the Bishop of Roda. Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez, the new Bishop of Huesca (1076‚Äì1086) and brother of the king, regarded this as an infringement of the rights of jurisdiction granted the Bishop of Jaca by the Council of Jaca. He therefore renewed his petition to the new pope (Gregory VII) to have the decisions of the council confirmed, which request the pope granted (cf. Jaff√©, \\"Reg. Pont. Roman\\", I, 2nd ed., Berlin, 1885, n. 5098). As, however, Bishop Raimundo of Roda also obtained the confirmation of all his privileges from Gregory, a violent dispute arose between the Bishops of Huesca and Roda as to jurisdiction over the churches of Barbastro, Bielsa, Gistao and Alquezar, which in 1080 was decided by the king in favour of the Bishop of Roda. =The episcopal see returns to Huesca (1096‚Äì1572)= In November 1096, King Pedro I of Aragon took back Huesca from the Moors and restored the original see. Pope Urban II decreed (May 11, 1098) that, instead of Jaca, Huesca should again be the seat of the bishop, as it had been until the year 713 (cf. Jaff√©, \\"Reg. Pont. Roman\\", I, 2nd ed., Berlin, 1885, n. 5703). But Jaca itself had a separate existence under a vicar-general, independent of the Bishop of Huesca. It also retained its own cathedral chapter, which originally followed the Rule of St. Augustine, but in 1270 both this chapter and that of Huesca were secularized. =Diocese of Jaca (1572 to the present)= Jaca was again erected into a separate diocese and was made suffragan to the Metropolitan See of Zaragoza by a Bull of Pope Pius V (July 18, 1571), which decision was carried into effect on February 26, 1572. The first bishop was Pedro del Frago. According to the diocesan statistics of 1907 Jaca possessed 73,659 inhabitants, 151 parishes, 151 parish churches, 239 public and 10 private oratories, 236 secular priests, 30 regulars and 54 sisters. The religious institutes in the diocese are: * Augustinian Hermits, one monastery and novitiate; * Piarists, 2 houses for the training of boys; * Benedictine nuns, 1 convent and 18 professed sisters in the city of Jaca; * Sisters of Mercy of St. Anna, who have charge of the hospital at Jaca; * Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary, 1 house at Jaca; sisters of Mercy of St. Vincent de Paul, with a school at Jaca; * Little Sisters of the Aged Poor, with a home for the aged in a suburb of Jaca.
