The route is an alternate route of NY 3 between the village of Deferiet and Fargo, a hamlet within the town of Wilna. While NY 3 veers south to serve the village of Carthage, NY 3A follows a direct east‚Äìwest alignment between the two communities. The eastern half of the route passes through the Fort Drum limits. All of NY 3A is co- designated as County Route 36 (CR 36) and is co-signed as such. The origins of the route date back to the 1930s when it was first designated as part of NY 3\\\\. The alignments of NY 3 and New York State Route 3G between Deferiet and Fargo were flipped , placing NY 3 on its modern alignment via Carthage and NY 3G on modern NY 3A. The NY 3G designation was eliminated in the 1940s. Its former alignment went unnumbered until September 1950, when it was redesignated as NY 3A. Route description NY 3A and CR 36 approaching the railroad tracks that mark the entrance to Fort Drum in Wilna NY 3A begins at an intersection with NY 3 in the village of Deferiet. It heads northeastward, passing to the south of the village center as it heads through an undeveloped area of the community. It continues across a small canal and past a chemical plant before turning eastward and leaving the Deferiet village limits. The route heads on through the town of Wilna, passing through a small, unnamed community built up around CR 37 and little else before entering the limits of Fort Drum. While in Fort Drum, NY 3A heads through a dense forest as it heads across an area with no development whatsoever. This trend finally ceases in the small hamlet of Fargo, where NY 3A passes by a handful of buildings before ending at another junction with NY 3. All of NY 3A is maintained by Jefferson County; as a result, it is co-designated and co-signed as CR 36. History NY 3 originally went through Carthage on its way from Deferiet to Fargo. It was realigned to bypass Carthage to the north on modern NY 3A. The former routing of NY 3 between Deferiet and Carthage was originally designated as NY 3F; however, it was redesignated as NY 3G by the following year. NY 3 was moved back to the Deferiet‚ÄìCarthage‚ÄìFargo alignment while the NY 3G designation was transferred to the former routing of NY 3 between Deferiet and Fargo. The NY 3G designation was removed in the 1940s. Its former routing remained unnumbered until September 1950, when it was redesignated as NY 3A. In 2016, a study by the Missile Defense Agency of the United States Department of Defense proposed the idea of shutting down NY 3A to the public for a missile defense site at Fort Drum. Ceasing to be a public highway, the traffic that would follow NY 3A (AADT of 2,298) would be directed onto NY 3 directly through the village of Carthage.

Examples include binary matrices, the zero matrix, the matrix of ones, the identity matrix, and the adjacency matrices used in graph theory, amongst many others. Integer matrices find frequent application in combinatorics. Examples :\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cccr} 5 & 2 & 6 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 & 7 & 3 & 8\\\\\\\\\\\\ 5 & 9 & 0 & 4\\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & 1 & 0 & -3\\\\\\\\\\\\ 9 & 0 & 2 & 1\\\\end{array}\\\\right) and \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 5 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 9 & 2\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 7 & 3\\\\end{array}\\\\right) are both examples of integer matrices. Properties Invertibility of integer matrices is in general more numerically stable than that of non-integer matrices. The determinant of an integer matrix is itself an integer, thus the numerically smallest possible magnitude of the determinant of an invertible integer matrix is one, hence where inverses exist they do not become excessively large (see condition number). Theorems from matrix theory that infer properties from determinants thus avoid the traps induced by ill conditioned (nearly zero determinant) real or floating point valued matrices. The inverse of an integer matrix M is again an integer matrix if and only if the determinant of M is exactly 1 or -1. Integer matrices of determinant 1 form the group \\\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\\\mathbf{Z}), which has far-reaching applications in arithmetic and geometry. For n=2, it is closely related to the modular group. The intersection of the integer matrices with the orthogonal group is the group of signed permutation matrices. The characteristic polynomial of an integer matrix has integer coefficients. Since the eigenvalues of a matrix are the roots of the polynomial, the eigenvalues of an integer matrix are algebraic integers. In dimension less than 5, they can thus be expressed by radicals involving integers. Integer matrices are sometimes called integral matrices, although this use is discouraged.

Directed by Tina Hirsch, the film editor for Gremlins, the film features a remarkably similar plotline. It spawned two sequels, Munchie and Munchie Strikes Back, which possess no relation to the original film save the titles. These two films dealt with an impish, wish- granting creature named Munchie. Plot summary The protagonist, space archaeologist Simon Watterman, discovers a fossilized \\"Munchie\\" in a cave in Peru and accidentally reanimates it. Bringing the specimen back to the United States, Watterman's son and girlfriend name it Arnold. Cecil Watterman, Simon's evil twin brother and snack food entrepreneur, kidnaps Arnold while Cindy and Paul are making out. When Arnold is hurt by his kidnappers, it becomes aggressive and attacks Cecil's adopted son. Attempting to kill Arnold, they chop him into quarters, but instead of dying, Arnold multiplies into four new Munchies. The quartet of creatures develop a love of women, beer, attacking people, and junk food in the process.

Warren Professor of Psychology at Princeton University. She was an early investigator of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a research area that continues to be controversial. In November 2002, Discover magazine listed her as one of the 50 most important women scientists. Gould discovered evidence of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb of rats, marmosets and macaque monkeys. In her early studies, she laid the groundwork for understanding the relationship between stress and adult neurogenesis. Specifically, she and Dr. Heather A. Cameron reported on adrenal steroid control of adult neurogenesis in rat dentate gyrus. Additionally, her work has provided evidence of neurogenesis in the adult primate neocortex. Gould and the researchers reported new neurons in adult marmoset monkeys are added to three neocortical association areas important in cognitive function: the prefrontal, inferior temporal and posterior parietal cortex. The new neurons appeared to originate in the subventricular zone, where stem cells giving rise to other cell types are located. They then migrate through the white matter to the neocortex, extending axons. Continual addition of neurons in adulthood apparently contributes to association neocortex functions.  Education and early research  Gould was born in 1962 and received her Ph.D. in behavioral neuroscience in 1988 at UCLA. In 1989, she joined the lab of Bruce McEwen at Rockefeller University as a postdoctoral researcher investigating the effect of stress hormones on rat brains. Gould‚Äôs research focused on the death of cells in the hippocampus. While Gould was documenting the degeneration of these brains, she discovered evidence that pointed to the idea that the brain might also heal itself.  Earlier work in neurogenesis  Confused by this anomaly, Gould assumed she must have been making some simple experimental error, and she went to the Rockefeller library, hoping she could find an explanation as to what she was doing wrong. She ended up looking through numerous papers in the Rockefeller stacks. Several 1962 papers revealed the research at MIT by Joseph Altman claiming that adult rats, cats, and guinea pigs all formed new neurons. Altman‚Äôs results had been at first ridiculed, then ignored, and quickly forgotten in favor of Pasko Rakic's findings. Further investigation by Gould revealed that a decade later Michael Kaplan, at the University of New Mexico, had used an electron microscope to image neurons giving birth. Kaplan had, he believed, discovered new neurons everywhere in the mammalian brain, including the cortex. However, other scientists continued to support Rakic's doctrine which denied the possibility of neurogenesis in mammals. Kaplan is reported as remembering Rakic telling him that ‚ÄúThose [cells] may look like neurons in New Mexico, but they don‚Äôt in New Haven.‚Äù Like Altman before him, Kaplan abandoned his work in neurogenesis.  Confronting Rakic's data  Gould spent the next eight years quantifying endless numbers of radioactive rat hippocampi in pursuit of neurogenesis. Gould became a member of the Princeton faculty in 1997. The very next year, in a series of papers, Gould began documenting neurogenesis in primates, directly confronting Rakic‚Äôs data. She demonstrated that adult marmosets created new neurons in their brains, especially in the olfactory cortex and the hippocampus. By 1999, Rakic admitted that neurogenesis was real. To that end he published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that reported seeing new neurons in the hippocampus of macaques.  Current work  Gould's laboratory at Princeton studies the production of new neurons in the early postnatal and adult mammalian brain. Her laboratory explores issues related to the regulation of cell production and survival in three brain regions the hippocampus, the olfactory bulb and the neocortex in rodents and primates (marmosets and macaques). Gould and her colleagues believe the answer to the question, ‚ÄòWhat possible function could late-generated cells serve?‚Äô could have immense significance in neuroscience and their investigations are guided mostly by this question. Gould and her team are also endeavoring to discover how hormones modulate the production of new neurons and how experience affects new cell production and if so, through what underlying mechanisms.  Research by Gould and her colleagues  Hormonal regulation of cell production Gould and her colleagues found that the ovarian steroid estrogen enhances cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the adult rat. This effect can be seen following ovariectomy and hormone replacement as well as under naturally occurring changes in hormone levels. They discovered that cell proliferation peaks during proestrus, a time when estrogen levels are highest. Also and conversely, steroid hormones of the adrenal glands were found to inhibit cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus but do so indirectly via an NMDA receptor-dependent mechanism. Experience- dependent changes in neurogenesis Gould‚Äôs research has shown that exposure of aversive stimuli results in a decrease in cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of adult rats, tree shrews and marmoset monkeys. Gould and her colleagues have shown that social stress inhibits cell production in these three species in a series of studies. Furthermore, they have discovered that exposure of adult rats to the odors of natural predators, but not other novel odors, suppresses the proliferation of cells in the dentate gyrus. This effect was found to be dependent on adrenal steroids because the prevention of the stress-induced rise in glucocorticoids (by adrenalectomy and replacement with low-dose corticosterone in the drinking water) eliminated the inhibitory effect of fox odor on cell production. The importance of complex environments Gould‚Äôs team has observed that many new cells in the hippocampus of adult rats and monkeys do not survive in animals living under standard laboratory conditions. In rodents, they discovered that these cells can be rescued by exposing the animals to more complex environments. These results they believe reflect the deprived laboratory conditions in which experimental animals live. This they also suspect is a phenomenon, that is probably, even more pronounced in primates with higher social needs than in rodents. The Gould team is continuing to explore this issue by examining the brains of adult rats living in a visible burrow system and adult monkeys living in semi-naturalistic conditions with opportunities for foraging and other natural activities. The functional role of new neurons Although the function of new neurons in the adult brain is as yet unknown Gould and her colleagues have begun to conjecture possibilities. So many new neurons are generated in the hippocampus and these cells appear to be a sensitive to experience, therefore it seems likely to the Gould team that they participate in hippocampal function. They are exploring the possibility that new neurons participate in two functions of the hippocampus, learning and modulation of the stress response. They have shown that learning enhances the number of new neurons but only under certain conditions. Furthermore they have discovered, experimental depletion of new neurons is associated with impairment in certain types of learning but not others. A decrease in the number of new neurons following treatment with anti-mitotic drugs impairs trace eye blink conditioning but not spatial learning in a Morris water maze, both hippocampal-dependent tasks. Honors and awards Gould received a multitude of awards throughout the duration of her career. From 1989 to 1991, Gould was awarded an NRSA Individual postdoctoral fellowship. From 1991 to 1992, she was awarded the WinstonTri-Institutional (Rockefeller, Cornell, Sloan-Kettering) fellowship. From 1992 to 1993, she was awarded an American Paralysis Association grant. From 1993 to 1994, she was awarded the NIMH RO3 small grant. From 1994 to 1996, she was awarded the NARSAD Young Investigator Award. From 1994 to 1999, she was awarded the NIMH FIRST award. In 2000, she was awarded the National Academy of Sciences Troland Award. In 2006, she was awarded the NARSAD Distinguished Investigator Award. In 2009 she was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) for her groundbreaking work on neurogenesis.

As in most provinces of the Roman Empire, the religious beliefs and deities of the Pre- Roman populations mingled and coexisted with Roman mythology. In the Portuguese case, those Pre-Roman religions were basically Proto-Celtic or Celtic, chief amongst them that of the Lusitanians' (see Lusitanian mythology). Jewish populations have existed in the area, going back to the Roman era or even before that, and are directly related to Sephardi history. The Roman Provinces of Lusitania (comprising most of Portugal south of the Douro river) and of Gallaecia (north of the Douro river) were first Christianized while part of the Roman Empire. During this period, Bracara Augusta (the modern city of Braga) became one of the most important episcopal centres, alongside Santiago de Compostela. Christianity was solidified when the Suevi and the Visigoths‚ÄîGermanic tribes already Christianized‚Äîcame into the Iberian Peninsula in the fifth century. Early Visigoths followed the Arian heresy, but they joined Roman mainstream after the eighth century. The city of Braga played an important role in the religious history of the period, namely during the renunciation of the Arian and Priscillianist heresies. Two synods were held in Braga in the sixth century, marking the origin of its ecclesiastical significance. The Archbishops of Braga retains the title of Primate of Portugal, and long claimed supremacy over the whole of the churches of Hispania. Braga had an important role in the Christianization of the whole Iberian Peninsula. The first known bishop of Braga, Paternus, lived during the end of the fourth century, although Saint Ovidius (d. 135 AD) is sometimes considered one of the first bishops of this city.Santi Beati In the early fifth century, Paulus Orosius, a friend of Saint Augustine, born in Braga, wrote several theological and historical works of great importance. In the sixth century, another influential figure was Saint Martin of Braga, a bishop of Braga who converted the Suevi from Arianism to Catholicism. He also founded an important monastery near Braga, in Dumio (Dume), now an archaeological site. Several Ecumenical Councils were held in Braga during this period, a sign of the religious importance of the city. Christianity saw its importance diminish in southern Portugal during Moorish rule in the Al-Andalus period, beginning in 711 with the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, even if most of the population still followed Christianity according to the Mozarabic Rite. In the north, however, Christianity provided the cultural and religious cement that helped hold Portugal together as a distinctive entity, at least since the reconquest of Porto in 868 by V√≠mara Peres, the founder of the First County of Portugal. By the same token, Christianity was the rallying cry of those who rose up against the Moors and sought to drive them out. Hence, Christianity and the Catholic Church pre-dated the establishment of the Portuguese nation, a point that shaped relations between the two. Under Afonso Henriques (r. 1139‚Äì1185), the first king of Portugal and the founder of the Portuguese Kingdom, church and state were unified into a lasting and mutually beneficial partnership. To secure papal recognition of his country, Afonso declared Portugal a vassal state of the Pope, and was as such recognized in 1179 through the papal bull Manifestis Probatum. The King found the Church to be a useful ally as he drove the Moors towards the South. For its support of his policies, Afonso richly rewarded the Church by granting it vast lands and privileges in the conquered territories. The Church became the country's largest landowner, and its power came to be equal to that of the nobility, the military orders, and even, for a time, the Crown. But Afonso also asserted his supremacy over the Church, a supremacy that ‚Äî with various ups and downs ‚Äî was maintained. Although relations between the Portuguese State and the Catholic Church were generally amiable and stable, their relative power fluctuated. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the Church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the reconquest and its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism. For a time, the Church's position vis-√†-vis the State diminished until the growth of the Portuguese Overseas Empire made its missionaries important agents of colonization (see, for example, Kingdom of Kongo). Until the 15th century, some Jews occupied prominent places in Portuguese political and economical life. For example, Isaac Abrabanel was the treasurer of King Afonso V of Portugal. Many also had an active role in the Portuguese culture, and they kept their reputation of diplomats and merchants. By this time, Lisbon and √âvora were home to important Jewish communities. In 1497, reflecting events that had occurred five years earlier in Spain, Portugal expelled the Jews and the few remaining Moors ‚Äî or forced them to convert. In 1536, the Pope gave King Jo√£o III (r. 1521‚Äì1557) permission to establish the Portuguese Inquisition to enforce the purity of the faith. Earlier, the country had been rather tolerant, but now orthodoxy and intolerance reigned. The Jesuit Order was placed in charge of all education. In the 18th century, anti-Church sentiment became strong. The Marqu√™s de Pombal (r. 1750‚Äì1777) expelled the Jesuits in 1759, broke relations with the Holy See in Rome, and brought education under the State's control. Pombal was eventually removed from his office, and many of his reforms were undone, but anti-Clericalism remained a force in Portuguese society. In 1821, the Inquisition was abolished, religious orders were banned, and the Church lost much of its property. Relations between Church and State improved in the second half of the 19th century, but a new wave of anti-Clericalism emerged with the establishment of the Portuguese First Republic in 1910. Not only were Church properties seized and education secularized, but the Republic went so far as to ban the ringing of church bells, the wearing of clerical garb on the streets, and the holding of many popular religious festivals. With the outbreak of the First World War the Portuguese First Republic viewed it as a unique opportunity to achieve a number of goals: putting an end to the twin threats of a Spanish invasion of Portugal and of foreign occupation of the colonies and, at the internal level, creating a national consensus around the regime. These domestic objectives were not met and the armed forces, whose political awareness had grown during the war, and whose leaders had not forgiven the regime for sending them to a war they did not want to fight, seemed to represent, to conservative forces, the last bastion of \\"order\\" against the \\"chaos\\" that was taking over the country. By the mid-1920s the domestic and international scenes began to favour an authoritarian solution, wherein a strengthened executive might restore political and social order. Estado Novo Under the Estado Novo, the corporatist totalitarian regime of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar (r. 1932‚Äì1968), the Church experienced a revival. Salazar was himself deeply religious and infused with Catholic precepts. Before studying law, he had been a seminarian; his roommate at the University of Coimbra, Manuel Gon√ßalves Cerejeira, later became Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon. In addition, Salazar's corporatist principles and his constitution and labour statute of 1933 were infused with Roman Catholic precepts from the papal encyclicals Rerum novarum (1891) and Quadragesimo anno (1931). Salazar's state claimed to base itself on the principles of traditional Roman Catholicism, with an emphasis on order, discipline, and authority. Class relations were supposedly based on harmony rather than the Marxist concept of conflict. The family, the parish, and Christianity were said to be the foundations of the State. Salazar went considerably beyond these principles, however, and established a full-fledged dictatorship. His corporate government, in the opinion of some, contained about equal blends of Roman Catholic principles and Benito Mussolini-like fascism. In 1940, a Concordat governing Church‚ÄìState relations was signed between Portugal and the Vatican. The Church was to be \\"separate\\" from the State but to enjoy a special position. The Concordat of 1940 reversed many of the anticlerical policies adopted during the First Republic, and the Catholic Church was given exclusive control over religious instruction in the public schools. Only Catholic clergy could serve as chaplains in the armed forces. Divorce, which had been legalized by the republic, was made illegal for those married in a Church service, but remained legal with respect to civil marriage. The Church was given formal \\"juridical personality,\\" enabling it to incorporate and hold property. Under Salazar, critics believe that Church and State in Portugal maintained a comfortable and mutually reinforcing relationship. While assisting the Church in many ways, however, Salazar insisted that it stay out of politics ‚Äî unless it praised his regime. Dissent and criticism were forbidden; those clergy who stepped out of line ‚Äî an occasional parish priest and once the Bishop of Porto ‚Äî were silenced or forced to leave the country. The rest of the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy, led by Cardinal Manuel Gon√ßalves Cerejeira, a great friend and supporter of Salazar, remained silent on the issue. Changes after the Revolution of 1974 In the Portuguese Constitution of 1976, after the Carnation Revolution of 1974 and the transition to democracy, Church and State were again formally separated. The Church continues to have a special place in Portugal, but for the most part, it has been disestablished. Other religions are now free to organize and practice their beliefs. Prozelo In addition to constitutional changes, Portugal became a more secular society. The practice of religion has since declined . The number of men becoming priests fell, as did charitable offerings and attendance at Mass. By the early 1990s, most Portuguese still considered themselves Roman Catholic in a vaguely cultural and religious sense, but only about one-third of them attended Mass regularly. Indifference to religion was most likely among men and young people. Regular churchgoers were most often women and young children. The Church no longer had its former social influence. During the 19th century and on into the Salazar regime, the Church was one of the most powerful institutions in the country ‚Äî along with the Army and the social and economic elite. In fact, military, economic, governmental, and religious influences in Portugal were closely intertwined and interrelated, often literally so. Traditionally, the first son of elite families inherited land, the second went into the army, and the third became a bishop. By the early 1990s, however, the Roman Catholic Church no longer enjoyed this pre-eminence but had fallen to seventh or eighth place in power among Portuguese interest groups. By the 1980s, the Church seldom tried to influence how Portuguese voted, knowing such attempts would probably backfire. During the height of the revolutionary turmoil in the mid-1970s, the Church urged its communicants to vote for centrist and conservative candidates and to repudiate communists, especially in northern Portugal, but after that the Church refrained from such an overt political role. The Church was not able to prevent the enactment of the constitution of 1976, which separated Church and State, nor could it block legislation liberalizing divorce or abortion, issues it regarded as moral and within the realm of its responsibility. Religious practices The image of Our Lady of F√°tima present in the Chapel of the Apparitions, Cova da Iria, at the Sanctuary of F√°tima. The Sanctuary of Christ the King overlooking Lisbon in Almada. The practice of religion in Portugal has shown striking regional differences. Even in the early 1990s, 60 to 70 percent of the population in the traditionally Catholic North regularly attended religious services, compared with 10 to 15 percent in the historically anti-clerical South. In the Greater Lisbon Area, about 30 percent were regular churchgoers. The traditional importance of Catholicism in the lives of the Portuguese is evident in the physical organization of almost every village in Portugal. The village churches are usually in prominent locations, either on the main square or on a hilltop overlooking the village. Many of the churches and chapels were built in the 16th century at the height of Portugal's colonial expansion, and were often decorated with wood and gold leaf from the conquests. In recent decades, however, they were often in disrepair, for there were not enough priests to tend them. Many were used only rarely to honor the patron saints of the villages. Much of the country's religious life has traditionally taken place outside the formal structure and official domain of the Roman Catholic Church. This is especially true in rural areas where the celebration of saints' days and religious festivals is popular. The most famous religious event in Portugal has been the claimed apparition of the Virgin Mary to three children in Cova da Iria, in the village of F√°tima, in 1917. The apparition of the Heavenly Mother in this small village in the district of Santar√©m has led hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima each year, many in the hope of receiving healing. Women tended to practice their religion more than men did, as evidenced by church attendance. The image of the Virgin, as well as that of Christ, were commonly displayed, even in labour union offices or on signs in demonstrations. Other aspects of Portuguese folk religion were not approved by the official Church, including witchcraft, magic, and sorcery. Formal religion, folk beliefs, and superstition were frequently jumbled together. Particularly in the isolated villages of northern Portugal, belief in witches, witchcraft, and evil spirits was widespread. Some persons believed in the concept of the \\"evil eye\\" and feared those who supposedly possessed it. Again, women were the main practitioners. Almost every village had its \\"seers,\\" practitioners of magic, and \\"healers.\\" Evil spirits and even werewolves were thought to inhabit the mountains and byways, and it was believed that people must be protected from them. Children and young women were thought to be particularly vulnerable to the \\"evil eye.\\" As people became better educated and moved to the city, they lost some of these folk beliefs. But in the city and among educated persons alike, superstition could still be found, even in the early 1990s. Sorcerers, palm readers, and readers of cards had shops, particularly in poorer neighbourhoods, but not exclusively so. In short, a strong undercurrent of superstition still remained in Portugal. The formal Church disapproved of superstitious practices but was powerless to do much about them. In contrast to that of Spain, Roman Catholicism in Portugal was softer and less intense. The widespread use of folk practices and the humanization of religion made for a loving though remote God, in contrast to the harshness of the Spanish vision. In Portugal, unlike Spain, God and his saints were imagined as forgiving and serene. In Spain, the expressions depicted on the faces of saints and martyrs were painful and anguished; in Portugal they were complacent, calm, and pleasant.http://countrystudies.us/portugal/59.htm  Other Christians   Protestantism  For most of Portugal's history, few non‚ÄìRoman Catholics lived in the country; those who did could not practice their religion freely. They had been kept out of the country for three centuries by the Inquisition. However, the British began settling in Portugal in the nineteenth century brought other Christian denominations with them. Most belonged to the Anglican Church of England, but others were Protestant Methodists, Congregationalists, Baptists, and Presbyterians. The establishment of a constitutional monarchy in 1834 granted limited religious toleration, and consequently led to the opening of an Anglican chapel (St. George's Church, Lisbon). A second chapel was opened in 1868. The Anglican mission coincided with the growing influence of the Old Catholic movement in Portugal. Congregations were created from Roman Catholic priests and laypeople who refused to accept the dogmas of the infallibility and universal ordinary jurisdiction of the Pope, as defined by the First Vatican Council in 1870. The Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church was formed as a result in 1880 (and has been a member church of the Anglican Communion since 1980); however, laws still restricted the activities of non‚ÄìRoman Catholics. St Andrew's Church, Lisbon - a congregation of the Church of Scotland - was built in 1899. The oldest Portuguese-speaking Protestant denomination is the Igreja Evang√©lica Presbiteriana de Portugal (Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Portugal), tracing its origins back to the work of a Scottish missionary on Madeira in the early 19th century.http://www.igreja-presbiteriana.org IEPP websitehttp://www.oikoumene.org/en/member- churches/regions/europe/portugal/evangelical-presbyterian-church-of- portugal.html World Council of Churches' website By the early 1990s, only some 50,000 to 60,000 Anglicans and Protestants lived in Portugal, less than 1 percent of the total population. The 1950s and 1960s saw the arrival of Pentecostals, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Jehovah's Witnesses, all of whom increased in numbers more rapidly than the earlier arrivals did. All groups, however, were hampered by prohibitions and restrictions against the free exercise of their religions, especially missionary activities. These restrictions were lifted after the Revolution of 1974. The constitution of 1976 guarantees all religions the right to practice their faith. Non‚ÄìRoman Catholic groups came to be recognized as legal entities with the right to assemble. Portuguese who were both not Roman Catholics and were conscientious objectors had the right to apply for alternative military service. The Roman Catholic Church, however, still sought to place barriers in the way of missionary activities.  Eastern Orthodoxy  The Eastern Orthodox Church is present in small numbers in Portugal, mostly through diaspora from Eastern European countries with a native Eastern Orthodox population. Some are organised through local jurisdictions of their mother churches, most often headed from Spain or other neighbouring countries. These include: * The , part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and based in Madrid. It was established in 2003 from part of the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of France. * The Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Western Europe, based in Paris, has one missionary parish in Portugal. * The , based in Paris, has an auxiliary bishop in Spain and Portugal. * The Eparchy of Central and Western Europe of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (with seat in Berlin), has one parish in Portugal. * The of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, headed from Geneva by Archbishop Michael (Donskoff), also has one parish in Portugal. * The Spanish-Portuguese Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, based in Madrid, claims 11 parishes in Portugal. It was established in December 2018 following the rupture of relations between Moscow and Constantinople. The latter had previously cared for Russian parishes through the Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox churches in Western Europe, based in Paris. There is also a non-canonical jurisdiction, the Lusitanian Orthodox Church, which defines itself as both Independent Catholic and Eastern Orthodox. It does not have any recognition from the canonical jurisdictions above. Other religions The Lisbon Mosque. Bah√° º√≠ Faith The first visitor of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith to Portugal was in 1926. Its first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in Lisbon in 1946. In 1962 the Portuguese Bah√° º√≠s elected their first National Spiritual Assembly. In 1963 there were nine assemblies. The population of the Bah√° º√≠ community Ain Portugal was estimated at some 2,100 members in 2010 according to the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia). Hinduism Presently there is a Hindu community of approximately 9,000 persons, which mostly used to trace its origins to Indians who emigrated from the former Portuguese colonies of Lusophone Africa, particularly from Mozambique, and from the former colony of Portuguese India. From the mid 1990s on there was an influx of Hindus of Nepalese origin in Portugal as a result of labour migration originated from that South Asian country. Also since the 1990s it is possible to find in Lisbon a small Hare Krishna community, consisting mainly of Portuguese, devotees from other European countries Presently there is a Hindu community of approximately 9,000 persons, which largely traces its origins to Indians who emigrated from the former Portuguese colonies of Lusophone Africa, particularly from Mozambique, and from the former colony of Goa and other possessions in Portuguese India[ From the mid 1990s on there was an influx of Hindus of Nepalese origin in Portugal as a result of labour migration originated from that South Asian country. Also since the 1990s it is possible to find in the Metropolitan Areas of Lisbon and Porto, the Algarve, the Norte, the Centro, the Alentejo, the Madeira and the Azores Islands regions (i.e., all regions) several Hare Krishna communities, consisting mainly of non-Portuguese Europeans, Brazilians, US citizens and a few Portuguese. Hindus in Portugal are, according to the Indian Embassy in Lisbon, mainly Gujaratis (Gujarati is taught at the Hindu Community Cultural Centre, in Lisbon), Punjabis and Goans. The majority of the Hindus live in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, a few in Lisbon itself and also in the Porto Metropolitan area, some in Porto itself. Judaism The Jewish community in Portugal numbered between 500 and 1,000 as of the early 1990s. The community was concentrated in Lisbon, and many of its members were foreigners. The persecution of Portuguese Jewry had been so intense that until the twentieth century Portugal had no synagogue or even regular Jewish religious services (the Lisbon Synagogue was founded in 1904). The few Jewish Portuguese were hence isolated from the main currents of Judaism. Their community began to revive when larger numbers of foreign Jews (embassy personnel, business people, and technicians) began coming to Portugal in the 1960s and 1970s. In northern Portugal, there are a few villages where Marranos, descendants of Jews who converted to Christianity to avoid persecution and whose religion was a mixture of Judaism and Christianity, still exist (see Belmonte Jews) numbering several thousand. Islam Portugal's Muslim community consists of a small number of immigrants from Portugal's former colonies in Africa, namely Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, and small numbers of recent immigrant workers from Northern Africa, mainly Morocco. In the 1991 census the number of Muslims in Portugal was under 10,000. The Muslim population in 2019 is approximately 65,000 people. The main Mosque in Portugal is the Lisbon Mosque. The majority of Muslims in the country are Sunnis, followed by approximately 5,000 to 7,000 Nizari Ismaili Shia Muslims. There is also a limited number of Ahmadiyya Muslims. In 2015, Lisbon was chosen to be the global seat of the Nizari Shi'a community; the second largest Shi'a denomination in the world. Their spiritual leader, the Aga Khan IV, purchased the historical Mendon√ßa Palace to use as its headquarters, as well as the headquarters of his foundation. Buddhism There is also a small population of between 50,000 and 80,000 Buddhists and Buddhist sympathisers (respectively) in Portugal. More than any other non-Christian denomination, and more than any other when it comes to sympathizers. A new Buddhist Vihara called Sumedharama, has been founded on July 2010 and located at north west of Lisbon, near Ericeira. Irreligion There are between 420,960 and 947,160 (4 to 9% of total population) atheist, agnostic, and irreligious people, according to other sources 6.5% of the population. According to the Census of 2011 there were 615,332 (6.84%) people who specifically stated they were without religion.

J. Oropeza, the warning passages in the New Testament describe at least three dangers which could lead a Christian to commit apostasy:B. J. Oropeza, \\"Apostasy and Perseverance in Church History\\" in Paul and Apostasy: Eschatology, Perseverance, and Falling Away in the Corinthian Congregation (T√ºbingen: Mohr-Siebeck, 2000), 2. Other signs of apostasy include loss of belief, personal suffering and hardships, malaise, and negligence towards the things of God (such as found in certain of the churches in Revelation), according to Oropeza's conclusion in Apostasy in the New Testament Communities (3 vols.; Eugene: Cascade, 2011-12), 3.236-41. Paul Barnett provides four reasons for apostasy: (1) Moral or Spiritual Failure; (2) Persecution; (3) False Teaching; (4) Self-Choice (Dictionary of the Later New Testament, 75) > :Temptations: Christians were tempted to engage in various vices that were a > part of their lives before they became Christians (idolatry, sexual > immorality, covetousness, etc.). :Deceptions: Christians encountered various > heresies and false teachings spread by false teachers and prophets that > threatened to seduce them away from their pure devotion to Christ. > :Persecutions: Christians were persecuted by the governing powers of the day > for their allegiance to Christ. Many Christians were threatened with certain > death if they would not deny Christ. Persecution is highlighted in the Epistle to the Hebrews and the First Epistle of Peter. The issue of false teachers/teachings is found in the Johannine and Pauline epistles, in the Second Epistle of Peter and the Epistle of Jude. A number of sections in the writings of Paul and James focus on vices and virtues. \\"These and other early texts helped to shape the trajectory of Christian response to the phenomenon of defection in the post-apostolic era.

The related verb aphistƒìmi (go away, withdraw, depart, fall away)Bauder, NIDNTT, 1:606 carries considerable theological significance in three passages (Luke 8:13; 1 Timothy 4:1; Hebrews 3:12).The Complete Biblical Library: Greek English Dictionary, apostasia, 10:394, and aphistƒìmi, 10:506. \\"In the LXX it [aphistƒìmi] is frequently a technical term for apostasy (from God), e.g., Deut 32:15; Jer 3:14; cf. also 1QS 7:18, 23\\" (Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament, 1:183). In The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology, Wolfgang Bauder writes: > 1 Timothy 4:1 describes \\"falling away from the faith\\" in the last days in > terms of falling into false, heretical beliefs.

Heinz Giesen, in the Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament, writes: > In the passive voice œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒØŒ∂œâ [skandaliz≈ç] more often means . . . \\"fall > away from faith.\\" In the interpretation of the parable of the sower (Mark > 4:13-20 par.

Paul Barnett notes that James warns his readers of the possibility of temptation leading to apostasy. While a person is not tempted by God to sin, they can be \\"lured and enticed by his own desires\\" to sin (James 1:13‚Äì15).Dictionary of the Later New Testament, 74. He adds, \\"This letter has in mind a 'way' (hodos, James 5:20) of belief and behavior, from which one may be \\"led astray\\" (planasthe, James 1:16; i.e., by the influence of others) or 'stray from' (planƒìthƒì, James 5:19; i.e., by one's own decision). Either way the one who is away from the true path is in jeopardy in regard to his or her personal salvation (James 5:20). Barnett also mentions that \\"2 Peter addresses the grim situation of apostasy expressed by immorality (2 Peter 2:2‚Äì3, 14-16), under the influence of false teachers who have 'denied the master who bought them' (2 Peter 2:1, 17-22).\\" Furthermore, in the book of Revelation: > It is clear that the churches of Asia are subject to persecution and its > accompanying pressure to apostatize that arise from a Jewish quarter in > Smyrna and Philadelphia (Revelation 2:9) and from the emperor cult in > Pergamum (Revelation 2:13). At the same time various false teachings are > touching the churches of Ephesus (Revelation 2:6), Pergamum (Revelation > 2:14‚Äì15) and Thyatira (Revelation 2:20). The language of \\"deception,\\" that > is, of being \\"led astray,\\" is applied to the false prophetess, Jezebel > (Revelation 2:20). Satan, the source of all these persecution and false > teachings, is also \\"the deceiver of the whole world\\" (Revelation 12:9).

New Testament scholar Scot McKnight argues that the warning passages (2:1‚Äì4; 3:7‚Äì4:13; 5:11‚Äì6:12; 10:19‚Äì39; 12:1‚Äì29) should be read and interpreted \\"as an organic whole, each of which expresses four components of the author‚Äôs message.\\"\\"The Warning Passages of Hebrews: A Formal Analysis and Theological Conclusions,\\" Trinity Journal 13.1 (1992): 23. These four components are \\"(1) the subjects or audience in danger of committing the sin, (2) the sin that leads to (3) the exhortation, which if not followed, leads to (4) the consequences of that sin.\\"\\"The Warning Passages of Hebrews,\\" 25 McKnight concluded from his study that (1) the subjects of this letter were genuine \\"believers, persons who . . . had converted to Jesus Christ,‚Äù (2) The sin \\"is apostasy, a deliberate and public act of deconfessing Jesus Christ, a rejection of God's Spirit, and a refusal to submit to God and His will,\\" (3) the exhortation is \\"to a persevering faithfulness to God and his revelation of the new covenant in Jesus Christ,\\" (4) the consequences involve \\"eternal damnation if a person does not persevere in the faith.\\"\\"The Warning Passages of Hebrews,\\" 54 B. J. Oropeza concludes that apostasy threatens the community in Hebrews on two fronts: mistreatment by outsiders (persecution) and malaise involving reluctance to listen to godly exhortation. B. J. Oropeza, Churches under Siege of Persecution and Assimilation: The General Epistles and Revelation; Apostasy in the New Testament Communities, volume 3 (Eugene: Cascade, 2012), 67-70. Imagery of Apostasy in the Bible The Dictionary of Biblical Imagery states that \\"There are at least four distinct images in Scripture of the concept of apostasy. All connote an intentional defection from the faith.\\"The Dictionary of Biblical Imagery, \\"Apostasy,\\" 39. These images are: Rebellion; Turning Away; Falling Away; Adultery.Dictionary of Biblical Imagery, 39. Rebellion \\"In classical literature apostasia was used to denote a coup or defection. By extension, the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) always uses this word to portray a rebellion against God (; ).\\" Turning away \\"Apostasy is also pictured as the heart turning away from God (Jeremiah 17:5‚Äì6) and righteousness (Ezekiel 3:20). In the OT it centers on Israel's breaking covenant relationship with God through disobedience to the law (Jeremiah 2:19), especially following other gods (Judges 2:19) and practicing their immorality (Daniel 9:9‚Äì11). . . . Following the Lord or journeying with him is one of the chief images of faithfulness in the Scriptures. . . . The . . . Hebrew root (swr) is used to picture those who have turned away and ceased to follow God ('I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me,' 1 Samuel 15:11). . . . The image of turning away from the Lord, who is the rightful leader, and following behind false gods is the dominant image for apostasy in the Old Testament.\\" Falling away \\"The image of falling, with the sense of going to eternal destruction, is particularly evident in the New Testament. . . . In his [Christ‚Äôs] parable of the wise and foolish builder, in which the house built on sand falls with a crash in the midst of a storm (Matthew 7:24‚Äì27) . . . he painted a highly memorable image of the dangers of falling spiritually.\\"Dictionary of Biblical Imagery, 39. Paul Barnett says, \\"Jesus foresaw the fact of apostasy and warned both those who would fall into sin as well as those who would cause others to fall (see, e.g., Mark 9:42‚Äì49).\\" (Dictionary of the Later New Testament, 73). Adultery One of the most common images for apostasy in the Old Testament is adultery.Dictionary of Biblical Imagery, 39 \\"Apostasy is symbolized as Israel the faithless spouse turning away from Yahweh her marriage partner to pursue the advances of other gods (Jeremiah 2:1‚Äì3; Ezekiel 16). . . . 'Your children have forsaken me and sworn by god that are not gods. I supplied all their needs, yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes' (Jeremiah 5:7, NIV). Adultery is used most often to graphically name the horror of the betrayal and covenant breaking involved in idolatry. Like literal adultery it does include the idea of someone blinded by infatuation, in this case for an idol: 'How I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts . . . which have lusted after their idols' (Ezekiel 6:9).\\" Other images A variety of colorful images are used to describe Israel's apostasy: \\"a rebellious ox, a prostitute, a wild vine, a stain that will not wash off, a camel in heat and a thief caught in thievery (Jeremiah 2:19-28).\\"Dictionary of Biblical Imagery, 40 Images of peril attend apostasy, for to have forsaken God is to come under his judgment (Exodus 22:20; Deuteronomy 6:14‚Äì15; 17:2‚Äì7). \\"The New Testament contains a host of images of apostasy, including a plant taking root among the rocks but withering under the hot sun of testing (Mark 4:5‚Äì6, 17 par.), or those who fall prey to the wiles of false teachers (Matthew 24:11), heretical beliefs (1 Timothy 4:1; 2 Timothy 4:3‚Äì4), worldliness and its defilement (2 Peter 2:20‚Äì22), and persecution (Matthew 24:9‚Äì10; Revelation 3:8). The Christian apostate is pictured as a branch that does not abide in the vine of Christ and thus withers and is cast into the fire (John 15:6). Animal behavior is evoked in a dog returning to its vomit or a clean pig returning to the mire (2 Peter 2:22).\\"Dictionary of Biblical Imagery, 40. Views of the early church fathers Paul Barnett says, \\"Believers in the era following that of the apostles probably suffered a greater intensity to turn aside from Christ than did their predecessors. They ... were vulnerable to Jewish reprisals as well as action from the state. Details of the pressure applied to Christians to apostatize is given from both Christian and non-Christian sources ... It is understandable, therefore, that the postapostolic literature should contain many warnings not to apostatize.\\"Dictionary of the Later New Testament, 75. So Oropeza, Paul and Apostasy, 3-12. See also Dictionary of Early Christian Beliefs: A Reference Guide to More Than 700 Topics Discussed by the Early Church Fathers, edited by David Bercot, under the topic of \\"Salvation,\\" \\"Can those who are saved ever be lost?\\": 586-591. The following warnings not to apostatize come from the translation provided by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson in the Ante-Nicene Fathers.Peabody: Hendrickson, 1994, obtained at http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/index.html Temptations: avoid vices and practice virtues Clement of Rome (c. 96) writes to the Corinthian congregation whose unity has been threatened because a \\"few rash and self- confident persons\\" have kindled shameful and detestable seditions towards the established leaders (presbyters) in the congregation (1 Clement 1). This jealous rivalry and envy has caused righteousness and peace to depart from the community (1 Clement 3). The writer laments: \\"Every one abandons the fear of God, and is become blind in His faith, neither walks in the ordinances of His appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian, but walks after his own wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy, by which death itself entered into the world.\\" (1 Clement 3) Since history has demonstrated that many evils have flowed from envy and jealousy (1 Clement 4-6), the Corinthians are exhorted to repent (1 Clement 7-8), yield obedience to God's \\"glorious will,\\" and to \\"forsake all fruitless labors and strife, and envy, which leads to death\\" (1 Clement 9:1). Furthermore, they are to \\"be of humble mind, laying aside all haughtiness, and pride, and foolishness, and angry feelings\\" (1 Clement 13), and \\"to obey God rather than to follow those who, through pride and sedition, have become the leaders of a detestable emulation [jealous rivalry]\\" (1 Clement 14). He then warns, \\"For we shall incur no slight injury, but rather great danger, if we rashly yield ourselves to the inclinations of men who aim at exciting strife and tumults, so as to draw us away from what is good\\" (1 Clement 14; cf. 47). Clement bids his readers to cleave \\"to those who cultivate peace with godliness\\" (1 Clement 15), and to follow the humility and submission that Christ and other saints practiced (1 Clement 16-19), which brings peace and harmony with others (1 Clement 19-20). Clement then gives these exhortations and warnings: > :Take heed, beloved, lest His many kindnesses lead to the condemnation of us > all. [For thus it must be] unless we walk worthy of Him, and with one mind > do those things which are good and well-pleasing in His sight. (1 Clement > 21) :Since then all things are seen and heard [by God], let us fear Him, and > forsake those wicked works which proceed from evil desires; so that, through > His mercy, we may be protected from the judgments to come. For whither can > any of us flee from His mighty hand? Or what world will receive any of those > who run away from Him? (1 Clement 28) :Let us therefore earnestly strive to > be found in the number of those who wait for Him, in order that we may share > in His promised gifts.Three sentences earlier these \\"gifts of God\\" (1 > Clement 35:1) are mentioned as: \\"Life in immortality, splendor in > righteousness, truth in perfect confidence, faith in assurance, self-control > in holiness!\\" (1 Clement 35:2) But how, beloved, shall this be done? If our > understanding be fixed by faith towards God; if we earnestly seek the things > which are pleasing and acceptable to Him; if we do the things which are in > harmony with His blameless will; and if we follow the way of truth, casting > away from us all unrighteousness and iniquity, along with all covetousness, > strife, evil practices, deceit, whispering, and evil-speaking, all hatred of > God, pride and haughtiness, vainglory and ambition. For they that do such > things are hateful to God; and not only they that do them, but also those > who take pleasure in those who do them. (1 Clement 35) :Why are there > strifes, and tumults, and divisions, and schisms, and wars among you? Have > we not [all] one God and one Christ? Is there not one Spirit of grace poured > out upon us? And have we not one calling in Christ? Why do we divide and > tear to pieces the members of Christ, and raise up strife against our own > body, and have reached such a height of madness as to forget that \\"we are > members one of another?\\" Remember the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, how He > said, \\"Woe to that man [by whom offences come]! It were better for him that > he had never been born, than that he should cast a stumbling-block before > one of my elect. Yea, it were better for him that a millstone should be hung > about [his neck], and he should be sunk in the depths of the sea, than that > he should cast a stumbling-block before one of my little ones.\\" Your schism > has subverted [the faith of] many, has discouraged many, has given rise to > doubt in many, and has caused grief to us all. And still your sedition > continues. (1 Clement 46) Those responsible for laying the foundation of this sedition are urged to submit to the presbyters, repent, and to lay aside their pride and arrogance. For it is better that they occupy a humble place in the flock of Christ, than being highly exalted and ultimately \\"cast out from the hope of His people\\" (1 Clement 57).Clement places a lot of emphasis on works of righteousness‚Äîavoiding sin and pursuing holiness. However, one should keep in mind that he says: \\"And we, too, [like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob] . . . are not justified by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom, or understanding, or godliness, or works which we have wrought in holiness of heart; but by that faith through which, from the beginning, Almighty God has justified all men.\\" (1 Clement 32) Similar to Clement, Ignatius of Antioch (c. 107) warns believers about following a schismatic person: > Keep yourselves from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend, > because they are not the planting of the Father. Not that I have found any > division among you, but exceeding purity. For as many as are of God and of > Jesus Christ are also with the bishop. And as many as shall, in the exercise > of repentance, return into the unity of the Church, these, too, shall belong > to God, that they may live according to Jesus Christ. Do not err, my > brethren. If any man follows him that makes a schism in the Church, he shall > not inherit the kingdom of God. (Epistle of the Philadelphians 3) Ignatius > later writes: \\"For where there is division and wrath, God does not dwell. To > all them that repent, the Lord grants forgiveness, if they turn in penitence > to the unity of God, and to communion with the bishop\\" (Philadelphians 8:1). The author of the epistle of Barnabas (c. 100) both admonishes and warns his readers about coming dangers: > :Since, therefore, the days are evil, and Satan possesses the power of this > world, we ought to give heed to ourselves, and diligently inquire into the > ordinances of the Lord. Fear and patience, then, are helpers of our faith; > and long-suffering and continence are things which fight on our side. . . . > We ought therefore, brethren, carefully to inquire concerning our salvation, > lest the wicked one, having made his entrance by deceit, should hurl us > forth from our [true] life. (Barnabas 2:1‚Äì2, 10).B. J. Oropeza comments that > this passage refers to \\"careless Christians\\" who forfeit their \\"salvific > life\\" (Paul and Apostasy, 203) :Let us then utterly flee from all the works > of iniquity, lest these should take hold of us; and let us hate the error of > the present time, that we may set our love on the world to come: let us not > give loose reins to our soul, that it should have power to run with sinners > and the wicked, lest we become like them. (Barnabas 4:1‚Äì2)For believers to > become wicked sinners is, in the author's mind, to share in their same > fate‚Äî\\"eternal death with punishments\\" (Barnabas 20:1). :We take earnest heed > in these last days; for the whole [past] time of your faith will profit you > nothing, unless now in this wicked time we also withstand coming sources of > danger, as becomes the sons of God. That the Black One may find no means of > entrance, let us flee from every vanity, let us utterly hate the works of > the way of wickedness. . . . (Barnabas 4:9‚Äì10) :Let us be spiritually- > minded: let us be a perfect temple to God. As much as in us lies, let us > meditate upon the fear of God, and let us keep His commandments, that we may > rejoice in His ordinances. The Lord will judge the world without respect of > persons. Each will receive as he has done: if he is righteous, his > righteousness will precede him; if he is wicked, the reward of wickedness is > before him. Take heed, lest resting at our ease, as those who are the called > [of God], we should fall asleep in our sins, and the wicked prince, > acquiring power over us, should thrust us away from the kingdom of the Lord. > (Barnabas 4:11‚Äì13) In the last chapters of the epistle of Barnabas (18-21), the author sets two ways before Christians which are described in the metaphors of light and darkness (referring to abstaining from or the practicing of vices).Oropeza, Paul and Apostasy, 3. Those who walk in the light \\"will be glorified in the kingdom of heaven\\" (Barnabas 21:1), and will be \\"safe in the day of judgment\\" (Barnabas 21:6).The following is a summary of the way of light: to love and glorify God; to not join yourself with those who walk in the way of death; to not forsake the Lord‚Äôs commandments; to not exalt or take glory to yourself; to not take evil counsel against your neighbor; to not allow over-boldness to enter into your soul; to not commit fornication or adultery; to not be a corrupter of youth; to not allow any kind of impurity to come out of your mouth; to not be mindful of evil against your brother; to not be of a doubtful mind; to not take the name of the Lord in vain; to not slay the child by procuring abortion, nor destroying it after it is born; to not covet; to not make a schism; to hate what is unpleasing to God and all hypocrisy; to hate the wicked one; to be pure in your soul (as far as possible); to be meek and peaceable; to love your neighbor; and to confess your sins. (Barnabas 19:2‚Äì12) While those who walk in darkness will experience \\"eternal death with punishment\\" (Barnabas 20:1), and will be \\"destroyed with their works\\" (Barnabas 21:1).The vices which lead to death and \\"destroy the soul\\" (Barnabas 20:1) are the following: idolatry, over-confidence, the arrogance of power, hypocrisy, double-heartedness, adultery, murder, rapine [i.e., plundering], haughtiness, transgression, deceit, malice, self-sufficiency, poisoning, magic, avarice, want of the fear of God. [In this way, too,] are those who persecute the good, those who hate truth, those who love falsehood, those who know not the reward of righteousness, those who cleave not to that which is good, those who attend not with just judgment to the widow and orphan, those who watch not to the fear of God, [but incline] to wickedness, from whom meekness and patience are far off; persons who love vanity, follow after a reward, pity not the needy, labor not in aid of him who is overcome with toil; who are prone to evil-speaking, who know not Him that made them, who are murderers of children, destroyers of the workmanship of God; who turn away him that is in want, who oppress the afflicted, who are advocates of the rich, who are unjust judges of the poor, and who are in every respect transgressors. (Barnabas 20:1‚Äì2) \\"The Didache (c. 100) also maintains two ways: the way of life or death. The way of life is associated with loving God and one's neighbor. It involves abstaining from vices mentioned in the Ten Commandments or related to bodily lusts, sorcery, and idolatry (including meat sacrificed to idols).Other vices to be abstained from are: murder, adultery, pederasty, fornication, stealing, practicing magic or witchcraft, killing a child by abortion; coveting; bearing false witness; speaking evil; lying; filthy talking; hypocrisy; hating others, money-loving, lustful, being hot-tempered, jealous, or quarrelsome. (Didache 1‚Äì4) The way of death includes the practices of these vicesThe vices that the author associates with the way of death are: murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines [i.e., plunderings], false witnessings, hypocrisies, double-heartedness, deceit, haughtiness, depravity, self-will, greediness, filthy talking, jealousy, over-confidence, loftiness, boastfulness; persecutors of the good, hating truth, loving a lie, not knowing a reward for righteousness, not cleaving to good nor to righteous judgment, watching not for that which is good, but for that which is evil; from whom meekness and endurance are far, loving vanities, pursuing requital, not pitying a poor man, not laboring for the afflicted, not knowing Him that made them, murderers of children, destroyers of the handiwork of God, turning away from him that is in want, afflicting him that is distressed, advocates of the rich, lawless judges of the poor, utter sinners. Be delivered, children, from all these. (Didache 5) (Didache 1-6).‚Äù In Polycarp's epistle to the Philippians (2nd century) the vice of covetousness is a significant danger.Oropeza, Paul and Apostasy, 4. Presbyters are advised to be \\"keeping far off from all covetousness\\" (Philippians 6). Polycarp expresses his grief over a former presbyter Valens and his wife who apparently committed some act of covetousness. He hopes that the Lord will grant them repentance. He enjoins his readers to \\"abstain from covetousness,\\" and \\"every form of evil,\\" and goes on to give this warning, \\"If a man does not keep himself from covetousness, he shall be defiled by idolatry, and shall be judged as one of the heathen\\" (Philippians 11). Polycarp says believers \\"ought to walk worthy of His commandments and glory,\\" and that deacons are to be blameless, not slanderers or lovers of money, but temperate in all things, \\"walking according to the truth of the Lord\\" (Philippians 5). He then adds: > If we please Him in this present world, we shall receive also the future > world, according as He has promised to us that He will raise us again from > the dead, and that if we live worthily of Him, \\"we shall also reign together > with Him,\\" provided only we believe. In like manner, let the young men also > be blameless in all things, being especially careful to preserve purity, and > keeping themselves in, as with a bridle, from every kind of evil. For it is > well that they should be cut off from the lusts that are in the world, since > \\"every lust wars against the spirit;\\" [1 Peter 2:11] and \\"neither > fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, shall > inherit the kingdom of God,\\" [1 Corinthians 6:9‚Äì10] nor those who do things > inconsistent and unbecoming. Wherefore, it is needful to abstain from all > these things, being subject to the presbyters and deacons, as unto God and > Christ. (Philippians 5)Polycarp goes on to counsel presbyters to \\"be > compassionate and merciful to all, bringing back those that wander,\\" and to > \\"be zealous in the pursuit of that which is good, keeping ourselves from > causes of offense, from false brethren, and from those who in hypocrisy bear > the name of the Lord, and draw away vain men into error\\" (Philippians 6). In an ancient sermon (c. 150) the author exhorts his audience to pursue righteousness and abstain from vices: > Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for that will not save us. For He > saith, \\"Not everyone that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but he > that worketh righteousness.\\" Wherefore, brethren, let us confess Him by our > works, by loving one another, by not committing adultery, or speaking evil > of one another, or cherishing envy; but by being continent, compassionate, > and good. We ought also to sympathize with one another, and not be > avaricious.To be avaricious is to have an insatiable greed for riches. By > such works let us confess Him, and not by those that are of an opposite > kind. And it is not fitting that we should fear men, but rather God. For > this reason, if we should do such [wicked] things, the Lord hath said, \\"Even > though ye were gathered together to me in my very bosom, yet if ye were not > to keep my commandments, I would cast you off, and say unto you, Depart from > me; I know you not whence ye are, ye workers of iniquity.\\" (2 Clement 4) The author further summons his readers to \\"do the will of Him that called us,\\" (2 Clement 5) and to consider > that the sojourning in the flesh in this world is but brief and transient, > but the promise of Christ is great and wonderful, even the rest of the > kingdom to come, and of life everlasting. By what course of conduct, then, > shall we attain these things, but by leading a holy and righteous life, and > by deeming these worldly things as not belonging to us, and not fixing our > desires upon them? For if we desire to possess them, we fall away from the > path of righteousness. (2 Clement 5) The writer goes on to say that this present world (which urges one to \\"adultery and corruption, avarice and deceit\\"), is an enemy to the world to come (which \\"bids farewell to these things\\"), and thus, we cannot \\"be the friends of both\\" (2 Clement 6). Therefore, > :Let us reckon that it is better to hate the things present, since they are > trifling, and transient, and corruptible; and to love those [which are to > come,] as being good and incorruptible.

(2 Clement 6) :Let us also, while we > are in this world, repent with our whole heart of the evil deeds we have > done in the flesh, that we may be saved by the Lord, while we have yet an > opportunity of repentance.

(2 Clement 15‚Äì17) B. J. Oropeza writes: > :If the warning against vices and the call to repentance marks a facet of > apostasy in patristic writings of the late first and early second centuries, > the Shepherd of Hermas epitomizes this aspect.

Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 180) recounts how God has recorded the sins of men of old (David and Solomon) > for our instruction . . . that we might know, in the first place, that our > God and theirs is one, and that sins do not please Him although committed by > men of renown; and in the second place, that we should keep from wickedness. > For if these men of old time, who preceded us in the gifts [bestowed upon > them], and for whom the Son of God had not yet suffered, when they committed > any sin and served fleshly lusts, were rendered objects of such disgrace, > what shall the men of the present day suffer, who have despised the Lord‚Äôs > coming, and become the slaves of their own lusts? And truly the death of the > Lord became [the means of] healing and remission of sins to the former, but > Christ shall not die again in behalf of those who now commit sin, for death > shall no more have dominion over Him. . . . We ought not, therefore, as that > presbyter remarks, to be puffed up, nor be severe upon those of old time, > but ought ourselves to fear, lest perchance, after [we have come to] the > knowledge of Christ, if we do things displeasing to God, we obtain no > further forgiveness of sins, but be shut out from His kingdom. And therefore > it was that Paul said, \\"For if [God] spared not the natural branches, [take > heed] lest He also spare not thee\\" [Romans 11:21]. . . . (Against Heresies, > Book 4:27.2) Irenaeus proceeds to quote from 1 Corinthians 10:1‚Äì12,Irenaeus wrote: Thou wilt notice, too, that the transgressions of the common people have been described in like manner, not for the sake of those who did then transgress, but as a means of instruction unto us, and that we should understand that it is one and the same God against whom these men sinned, and against whom certain persons do now transgress from among those who profess to have believed in Him. But this also, [as the presbyter states,] has Paul declared most plainly in the Epistle to the Corinthians, when he says, \\"Brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and were all baptized unto Moses in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them; and the rock was Christ. But with many of them God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. These things were for our example (in figuram nostri), to the intent that we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted; neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them also did, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. But all these things happened to them in a figure, and were written for our admonition, upon whom the end of the world (saeculorum) is come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.\\" (Against Heresies, Book 4:27.3) where Israel fell under the judgment of God for craving evil things, and then comments: > As then the unrighteous, the idolaters, and fornicators perished, so also is > it now: for both the Lord declares, that such persons are sent into eternal > fire; and the apostle says, \\"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not > inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor > idolaters, nor adulterers, not effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with > mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor > extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\\" [1 Corinthians 6:9‚Äì10] And > as it was not to those who are without that he said these things, but to > us‚Äîlest we should be cast forth from the kingdom of God, by doing any such > thing. . . . And again does the apostle say, \\"Let no man deceive you with > vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the > sons of mistrust. Be not ye therefore partakers with them.\\" [Ephesians > 5:6‚Äì7] (Against Heresies, Book 4:27.4) Deceptions: watch out for false teachers and heresies The \\"early Christians frequently believed that apostasy came by way of deceivers at the instigation of the devil, and terrible consequences awaited such people.\\"Oropeza, Paul and Apostasy, 6. The writings of Ignatius have several warnings about being on guard against false teachers and the heresy they disseminate. In the letter to the Christians at Ephesus, Ignatius is happy to report that \\"all live according to the truth, and that no sect has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do you hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth\\" (Epistle to the Ephesians 6). He mentions that there are false teachers who \\"are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practice things unworthy of God, whom you must flee as you would wild beasts. For they are ravening dogs, who bite secretly, against whom you must be on your guard\\" (Epistle to the Ephesians 7).In another letter Ignatius writes: \\"Wherefore, as children of light and truth, flee from division and wicked doctrines. . . . For there are many wolves . . . who, by means of a pernicious pleasure, carry captive those that are running towards God; but in your unity they shall have no place\\" (Epistle to the Philadelphians 2). The readers are further admonished to \\"Let not then any one deceive you\\" (Epistle to the Ephesians 8), and commended because \\"you did not allow [false teachers] to sow among you, but stopped your ears, that you might not receive those things [i.e., false doctrines] which were sown by them\\" (Epistle to the Ephesians 9). Ignatius then gives this solemn warning: > Do not err, my brethren. Those that corrupt families shall not inherit the > kingdom of God. If, then, those who do this as respects the flesh have > suffered death, how much more shall this be the case with any one who > corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith of God, for which Jesus Christ was > crucified! Such a one becoming defiled [in this way], shall go away into > everlasting fire, and so shall every one that hearkens unto him. . . . Be > not anointed with the bad odor of the doctrine of the prince of this world; > let him not lead you away captive from the life which is set before you. And > why are we not all prudent, since we have received the knowledge of God, > which is Jesus Christ? Why do we foolishly perish, not recognizing the gift > which the Lord has of a truth sent to us? (Epistle to the Ephesians 16-17) In the letter to the Magnesians, Ignatius admonishes his readers, \\"Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are unprofitable\\" (Epistle to Magnesians 8). Later he writes: \\"I desire to guard you beforehand, that you fall not upon the hooks of vain doctrine, but that you attain to full assurance in regard to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in the time of the government of Pontius Pilate, being truly and certainly accomplished by Jesus Christ, who is our hope, from which may no one of you ever be turned aside\\" (Epistle to Magnesians 11). In yet another letter, Ignatius entreats his readers to > use Christian nourishment only, and abstain from herbage of a different > kind; I mean heresy. For those [that are given to this] mix up Jesus Christ > with their own poison, speaking things which are unworthy of credit, like > those who administer a deadly drug in sweet wine, which he who is ignorant > of does greedily take, with a fatal pleasure leading to his own death. Be on > your guard, therefore, against such persons. (Epistle to the Trallians 6-7) Furthermore: > Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with Jesus > Christ, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly > born, and ate and drank. He was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; He > was truly crucified, and [truly] died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and > on earth, and under the earth. He was also truly raised from the dead, His > Father quickening Him, even as after the same manner His Father will so > raise up us who believe in Him by Christ Jesus, apart from whom we do not > possess the true life. (Epistle to the Trallians 9) \\"The final section of the Didache echoes the Synoptic tradition (Matthew 24:4‚Äì13, 15, 21‚Äì26; Mark 13:5ff; Luke 21:8ff; cf. 2 Thessalonians 2:3ff; Revelation 13:13‚Äì14) when it warns against apostasy through the deception of false prophets in the last days:\\" > Watch for your life's sake. Let not your lamps be quenched, nor your loins > unloosed; but be ready, for you know not the hour in which our Lord comes. > But often shall you come together, seeking the things which are befitting to > your souls: for the whole time of your faith will not profit you, if you be > not made perfect in the last time. For in the last days false prophets and > corrupters shall be multiplied, and the sheep shall be turned into wolves, > and love shall be turned into hate; for when lawlessness increases, they > shall hate and persecute and betray one another, and then shall appear the > world-deceiver as the Son of God, and shall do signs and wonders, and the > earth shall be delivered into his hands, and he shall do iniquitous things > which have never yet come to pass since the beginning. Then shall the > creation of men come into the fire of trial, and many shall be made to > stumble and shall perish; but they that endure in their faith shall be saved > from under the curse itself. (Didache 16)Verheyden (\\"Eschatology in the > Didache,\\" 209) writes: \\"To describe the period that precedes the end Did. > does not refer to earthquakes or political and military disasters. Instead > it has selected a tribulation that forms a constant threat for the > community: the dangers of betrayal and of apostasy\\" (as quoted by Shawn > Wilhite, The Didache: A Commentary, 229). Tertullian argues that believers ought not to be surprised or alarmed at the existence of heresies since Christ and his apostlesTertullian mentions that it is the same apostle Paul, who in his letter to the Galatians: counts \\"heresies\\" among \\"the sins of the flesh,\\" [Galatians 5:20] who also intimates to Titus, that \\"a man who is a heretic\\" must be \\"rejected after the first admonition,\\" on the ground that \\"he that is such is perverted, and commits sin, as a self-condemned man.\\" [Titus 3:10‚Äì11] Indeed, in almost every epistle, when enjoining on us (the duty) of avoiding false doctrines, he sharply condemns heresies. Of these the practical effects are false doctrines, called in Greek heresies, a word used in the sense of that choice which a man makes when he either teaches them (to others) or takes up with them (for himself). For this reason it is that he calls the heretic self-condemned, because he has himself chosen that for which he is condemned. We, however, are not permitted to cherish any object after our own will, nor yet to make choice of that which another has introduced of his private fancy. In the Lord's apostles we possess our authority; for even they did not of themselves choose to introduce anything, but faithfully delivered to the nations (of mankind) the doctrine which they had received from Christ. If, therefore, even \\"an angel from heaven should preach any other gospel\\" (than theirs), he would be called accursed by us. (Prescription Against Heretics 6) told us beforehand that they would arise and gave, \\"in anticipation, warnings to avoid them\\" (Prescription Against Heretics 4, cf. 1).Therefore, heresies \\"must be shunned\\" (Prescription Against Heretics 4). Neither should believers be surprised that heresies \\"subvert the faith of some\\" (Prescription Against Heretics 1). Heresies are a trial to faith, giving faith the opportunity to be approved (Prescriptions Against Heretics 1). While heresies \\"are produced for the weakening and the extinction of faith,\\" they have \\"no strength whenever they encounter a really powerful faith\\" (Prescriptions Against Heretics 2). According to Tertullian, heresy is whatever contradicts the \\"rule of faith\\" which he defends as > the belief that there is one only God, and that He is none other than the > Creator of the world, who produced all things out of nothing through His own > Word, first of all sent forth; that this Word is called His Son, and, under > the name of God, was seen in diverse manners by the patriarchs, heard at all > times in the prophets, at last brought down by the Spirit and Power of the > Father into the Virgin Mary, was made flesh in her womb, and, being born of > her, went forth as Jesus Christ; thenceforth He preached the new law and the > new promise of the kingdom of heaven, worked miracles; having been > crucified, He rose again the third day; (then) having ascended into the > heavens, He sat at the right hand of the Father; sent instead of Himself the > Power of the Holy Ghost to lead such as believe; will come with glory to > take the saints to the enjoyment of everlasting life and of the heavenly > promises, and to condemn the wicked to everlasting fire, after the > resurrection of both these classes shall have happened, together with the > restoration of their flesh. This rule, as it will be proved, was taught by > Christ, and raises among ourselves no other questions than those which > heresies introduce, and which make men heretics. (Prescription Against > Heretics 13)Tertullian believes that all heresies \\"have been introduced by > the devil\\" (Prescription Against Heretics 40). Tertullian sees heretics as ravenous wolves \\"lurking within to waste the flock of Christ\\" (Prescription Against Heretics 4). They pervert the Scriptures by interpreting them to suit their own purposes (Prescription Against Heretics 17, cf. 4, 38).Tertullian notes that heretics frequently hang out with loose company, and that ungodliness is the natural effect of their teaching, since \\"they say that God is not to be feared; therefore all things are in their view free and unchecked\\" (Prescription against Heretics 43). Their teaching opposes the teaching \\"handed down from the apostles, the apostles from Christ, and Christ from God\\" (Prescription Against Heretics 37). While persecution makes martyrs, \\"heresy only apostates\\" (Prescription Against Heretics 4). In the face of heresies, which may cause a bishop or deacon to \\"have fallen from the rule (of faith),\\" the Christian must remain true to the faith, for \\"no one is a Christian but he who perseveres even to the end\\" (Prescription Against Heretics 3). Christian apologist Justin Martyr engages in a dialogue with Trypho (c. 160), who says, \\"I believe, however, that many of those who say that they confess Jesus, and are called Christians, eat meats offered to idols, and declare that they are by no means injured in consequence\\" (Dialogue with Trypho 35). Justin's response highlights the importance of remaining faithful to \\"the true and pure doctrine of Jesus Christ\\" in the face of false teachers: > The fact that there are such men confessing themselves to be Christians, and > admitting the crucified Jesus to be both Lord and Christ, yet not teaching > His doctrines, but those of the spirits of error, causes us who are > disciples of the true and pure doctrine of Jesus Christ, to be more faithful > and steadfast in the hope announced by Him. For what things He predicted > would take place in His name, these we do see being actually accomplished in > our sight. For he said, \\"Many shall come in My name, clothed outwardly in > sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\\" And, \\"There shall > be schisms and heresies.\\" [1 Corinthians 11:19] And, \\"Beware of false > prophets, who shall come to you clothed outwardly in sheep's clothing, but > inwardly they are ravening wolves.\\" And, \\"Many false Christ's and false > apostles shall arise, and shall deceive many of the faithful.\\" There are, > therefore, and there were many, my friends, who, coming forward in the name > of Jesus, taught both to speak and act impious and blasphemous things; and > these are called by us after the name of the men from whom each doctrine and > opinion had its origin. (For some in one way, others in another, teach to > blaspheme the Maker of all things, and Christ . . . Yet they style > themselves Christians. . . .) Some are called Marcians, and some > Valentinians, and some Basilidians, and some Saturnilians, and others by > other names; each called after the originator of the individual opinion. . . > . So that, in consequence of these events, we know that Jesus foreknew what > would happen after Him, as well as in consequence of many other events which > He foretold would befall those who believed on and confessed Him, the > Christ. For all that we suffer, even when killed by friends, He foretold > would take place; so that it is manifest no word or act of His can be found > fault with. Wherefore we pray for you and for all other men who hate us; in > order that you, having repented along with us, may not blaspheme Him who, by > His works, by the mighty deeds even now wrought through His name, by the > words He taught, by the prophecies announced concerning Him, is the > blameless, and in all things irreproachable, Christ Jesus; but, believing on > Him, may be saved in His second glorious advent, and may not be condemned to > fire by Him. (Dialogue with Trypho 35) Clement of Alexandria (c. 195) advises against giving into heretical men and their heresies in writing: > He who hopes for everlasting rest knows also that the entrance to it is > toilsome \\"and strait.\\" And let him who has once received the Gospel, even in > the very hour in which he has come to the knowledge of salvation, \\"not turn > back, like Lot's wife,\\" as is said; and let him not go back either to his > former life, which adheres to the things of sense, or to heresies. . . . He, > who has spurned the ecclesiastical tradition, and darted off to the opinions > of heretical men, has ceased to be a man of God and to remain faithful to > the Lord. (The Stromata, Book 7:16)Only he who \\"believes the Scripture and > voice of the Lord, which by the Lord acts to the benefiting of men, is > rightly [regarded] faithful.\\" (The Stromata, Book 7:16). Heretics are those > who are \\"giving themselves up to pleasures, [and] wrest Scripture, in > accordance with their lusts,\\" and \\"wrest them to their own opinions\\" (The > Stromata, Book 7:16). Furthermore, when they quote from the Scriptures they > \\"alter the meanings . . . according to their true nature\\" (The Stromata, > Book 7:16). Therefore, the author concludes that \\"we must never, as do those > who follow the heresies, adulterate the truth, or steal the canon of the > Church, by gratifying our own lusts and vanity, by defrauding our neighbors; > whom above all it is our duty, in the exercise of love to them, to teach to > adhere to the truth\\" (The Stromata, Book 7:16). Cyprian (c. 251) bids his readers to \\"use foresight and watching with an anxious heart, both to perceive and to beware of the wiles of the crafty foe, that we, who have put on Christ the wisdom of God the Father, may not seem to be wanting in wisdom in the matter of providing for our salvation\\" (The Treatises of Cyprian 1:1). He cautions that \\"it is not persecution alone that is to be feared; nor those things which advance by open attack to overwhelm and cast down the servants of God,\\" for we have an enemy who is to be more feared and guarded against because he secretly creeps in to deceive us under the appearance of peace (The Treatises of Cyprian 1:1). By following the example of the Lord in recognizing and resisting the temptations of the devil, Christians will not be \\"incautiously turned back into the nets of death,\\" but go on to \\"possess the immortality that we have received\\" (The Treatises of Cyprian 1:2).Cyprian states that this immortality is not possessed \\"unless we keep those commands of Christ whereby death is driven out and overcome, when He Himself warns us, and says, 'If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments?' [Matthew 19:17] And again: 'If ye do the things that I command you, henceforth I call you not servants, but friends.' [John 16:15]\\" (The Treatises of Cyprian 1:2) Only by standing fast in learning and doing what Christ commanded does the Christian have security against the onslaughts of the world (The Treatises of Cyprian 1:2). He who does not \\"must of necessity waver and wander, and, caught away by a spirit of error . . . be blown about; and he will make no advance in his walk towards salvation, because he does not keep the truth of the way of salvation.\\" (The Treatises of Cyprian 1:2) Cyprian says the devil, when he see his idols forsaken and temples deserted by new believers, devises a fraud under \\"the Christian name to deceive the incautious\\" (The Treatises of Cyprian 1:3): > He has invented heresies and schisms, whereby he might subvert the faith, > might corrupt the truth, might divide the unity. Those whom he cannot keep > in the darkness of the old way, he circumvents and deceives by the error of > a new way. He snatches men from the Church itself; and while they seem to > themselves to have already approached to the light, and to have escaped the > night of the world, he pours over them again, in their unconsciousness, new > darkness; so that, although they do not stand firm with the Gospel of > Christ, and with the observation and law of Christ, they still call > themselves Christians, and, walking in darkness, they think that they have > the light, while the adversary is flattering and deceiving, who, according > to the apostle's word, transforms himself into an angel of light, and equips > his ministers as if they were the ministers of righteousness, who maintain > night instead of day, death for salvation, despair under the offer of hope, > perfidy under the pretext of faith, antichrist under the name of Christ; so > that, while they feign things like the truth, they make void the truth by > their subtlety. This happens, beloved brethren, so long as we do not return > to the source of truth, as we do not seek the head nor keep the teaching of > the heavenly Master. (The Treatises of Cyprian 1:3) Oropeza states, > In view of Eusebius (c. 260-340), Simon Magus was the author of heresy (cf. > Acts 8:9‚Äì24), and the devil is to be blamed for bringing the Samaritan > magician to Rome and empowering him with deceitful arts which led many > astray (Eus. Hist. Eccl. 2.13). The magician was supposedly aided by demons > and venerated as a god, and Helen, his companion, was thought to be his > first emanation (Just. Apol. 1.26; Adv. Haer. 1.33; cf. Iren Haer. > 1.23:1‚Äì4). Simon's successor, Menander of Samaria, was considered to be > another instrument of the devil; he claimed to save humans from the aeons > through magical arts. After baptism, his followers believed themselves to be > immortal in the present life. It is stated that those who claim such people > as their saviors have fallen away from the true hope (Eus. Hist. Eccl. > 3.26). Basilides of Alexandria and Saturninus of Antioch followed Menander's > ways. Adherents of the former declared that eating meat sacrificed to idols > or renouncing the faith in times of persecution were matters of > indifference. Carpocrates is labeled as the first of the Gnostics. His > followers allegedly transmitted Simon‚Äôs magic in an open manner. Eusebius > asserts that the devil‚Äôs intention was to entrap many believers and bring > them to the abyss of destruction by following these deceivers (Hist. Eccl. > 4.7).Paul and Apostasy, 6‚Äì7. Oropeza adds: The use of anathemas and > excommunications became the normative means of handling heresy. Hippolytus > (c. 170‚Äì236) affirmed that there was no place for the heretic in the church; > expulsion from the earthly Eden was their lot. Cyprian (c. 258) viewed the > heretics as those who lose their salvation because they put themselves > outside the unity of the church. Cyril of Alexandria (c. 444) anathematized > Nestorianism, and creeds (such as the Athanasian) declared anathemas on > those who did not hold to the tenets of the creed. The condemnation of > heretics gave way to abuse as church and state distinctions were blurred > after the time of Constantine. (Paul and Apostasy, 7) Persecutions: perseverance and martyrdom Oropeza writes: > :The Martyrdom of Polycarp is sometimes considered to be the first of the > \\"Acts of the Martyrs.\\" In this document Polycarp is killed for refusing to > confess Caesar as Lord and offer incense; he refuses to revile Christ (Mar. > Pol. 8ff; similarly, Ign. Rom. 7). Other Christians did not always follow > his example. Some fell into idolatry in the face of persecutions. :Stirred > by his own experience under the Diocletian (c. 284-305) persecution, > Eusebius wrote Collection of Martyrs and emphasized persecution and > martyrdom in his History of the Church. He describes Christians who > persevered and others who fell away. Polycarp and Germanicus were found to > be faithful in the persecution at Smyrna (c. 160), but Quintus threw away > his salvation in the sight of the wild beasts (Eus. Hist.

It is recorded that in Gaul some > became martyrs, but others who were untrained and unprepared (about 10 in > number) proved to be \\"abortions\\" (ŒµŒæŒµœÑœÅœâœÉŒ±ŒΩ), discouraging the zeal of > others. A woman named Biblias, who had earlier denied Christ, confessed him > and was joined with the martyrs. Certain defectors did likewise, but others > continued to blaspheme the Christian faith, having no understanding of the > \\"wedding garment\\" (i.e., Matthew 22:11ff) and no faith (Hist. Eccl. 5.1). > :During the reign of Decius (c. 249-51), the Christians of Alexandria are > said to have endured martyrdom, stoning, or having their belongings > confiscated for not worshipping at an idol's temple or chanting > incantations. But some readily made unholy sacrifices, pretending that they > had never been Christians, while others renounced their faith or were > tortured until they did (Hist. Eccl. 6.41). In his account of the Diocletian > persecution, Eusebius commends the heroic martyrs but is determined to > mention nothing about those who made shipwreck of their salvation, believing > that such reports would not edify his readers (8.2:3). He recollects > Christians who suffered in horrible ways which included their being axed to > death or slowly burned, having their eyes gouged out, their limbs severed, > or their backs seared with melted lead. Some endured the pain of having > reeds driven under their fingernails or unmentionable suffering in their > private parts (8.12).Paul and Apostasy, 8. Terrullian (c. 213) asks, \\"Does > God covet man's blood [i.e., via martyrdom]? And yet I might venture to > affirm that He does, if man also covets the kingdom of heaven, if man covets > a sure salvation. . . .‚Äù (Scorpiace 6). Clement seeks to inspire perseverance in the midst of suffering with these words: \\"Let us, therefore, work righteousness, that we may be saved to the end. Blessed are they who obey these commandments, even if for a brief space they suffer in this world, and they will gather the imperishable fruit of the resurrection. Let not the godly man, therefore, grieve; if for the present he suffer affliction, blessed is the time that awaits him there; rising up to life again with the fathers he will rejoice for ever without a grief\\" (2 Clement 19). Cyprian (c. 250), commands the presbyters and deacons to take care of the poor and \\"especially those who have stood with unshaken faith and have not forsaken Christ's flock\\" while in prison (The Epistles of Cyprian 5:2). These \\"glorious confessors\\" need to be instructed that > they ought to be humble and modest and peaceable, that they should maintain > the honor of their name, so that those who have achieved glory by what they > have testified, may achieve glory also by their characters. . . . For there > remains more than what is yet seen to be accomplished, since it is written > \\"Praise not any man before his death;\\" and again, \\"Be thou faithful unto > death, and I will give thee a crown of life.\\" [Revelation 2:10] And the Lord > also says, \\"He that endures to the end, the same shall be saved.\\" [Matthew > 10:22]. Let them imitate the Lord, who at the very time of His passion was > not more proud, but more humble. (The Epistles of Cyprian 5:2)In another > letter, Cyprian rejoices over the presbyter and other confessors of Christ > \\"whom the devil has not been able to overcome,\\" but shares how he is grieved > \\"over those whom a hostile persecution has cast down\\" (The Epistles of > Cyprian 6:1). Ignatius's letter to the Christians in Rome gives valuable insight into the heart of a Christian who is prepared for martyrdom. Ignatius hopes to see them when he arrives as a prisoner. He fears that the love they have for him will, in some way, save him from certain death (Epistle to the Romans 1-2). Yet, he desires to \\"obtain grace to cling to my lot without hindrance unto the end\\" so that he may \\"attain to God\\" (Epistle to the Romans 1). He requests prayer for \\"both inward and outward strength\\" that he might not \\"merely be called a Christian, but really found to be one,\\"--a Christian \\"deemed faithful\\" (Epistle to the Romans 3). He says: > I write to the Churches, and impress on them all, that I shall willingly die > for God, unless you hinder me. . . . Allow me to become food for the wild > beasts, through whose instrumentality it will be granted me to attain to > God. I am the wheat of God, and let me be ground by the teeth of the wild > beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of Christ. Rather entice the wild > beasts, that they may become my tomb, and may leave nothing of my body. . . > . Then shall I truly be a disciple of Christ, when the world shall not see > so much as my body. Entreat Christ for me, that by these instruments I may > be found a sacrifice [to God]. . . . But when I suffer, I shall be the > freed-man of Jesus, and shall rise again emancipated in Him. And now, being > a prisoner, I learn not to desire anything worldly or vain. . . . And let no > one, of things visible or invisible, envy me that I should attain to Jesus > Christ. Let fire and the cross; let the crowds of wild beasts; let tearings, > breakings, and dislocations of bones; let cutting off of members; let > shatterings of the whole body; and let all the dreadful torments of the > devil come upon me: only let me attain to Jesus Christ. All the pleasures of > the world, and all the kingdoms of this earth, shall profit me nothing. It > is better for me to die in behalf of Jesus Christ, than to reign over all > the ends of the earth. \\"For what shall a man be profited, if he gain the > whole world, but lose his own soul?\\" Him I seek, who died for us: Him I > desire, who rose again for our sake. This is the gain which is laid up for > me. . . . Permit me to be an imitator of the passion of my God. (Epistle to > the Romans 4-6) Tertullian believes that martyrdom is necessary at times in order for soldiers in God's army to obey the command to not worship idols. > If, therefore, it is evident that from the beginning this kind of worship > [of idols] has both been forbidden‚Äîwitness the commands so numerous and > weighty‚Äîand that it has never been engaged in without punishment following, > as examples so numerous and impressive show, and that no offense is counted > by God so presumptuous as a trespass of this sort, we ought further to > perceive the purport of both the divine threatenings and their fulfillments, > which was even then commended not only by the not calling in question, but > also by the enduring of martyrdoms, for which certainly He had given > occasion by forbidding idolatry. . . . The injunction is given me not to > make mention of any other god, not even by speaking‚Äîas little by the tongue > as by the hand‚Äîto fashion a god, and not to worship or in any way show > reverence to another than Him only who thus commands me, whom I am both bid > fear that I may not be forsaken by Him, and love with my whole being, that I > may die for Him. Serving as a soldier under this oath, I am challenged by > the enemy. If I surrender to them, I am as they are. In maintaining this > oath, I fight furiously in battle, am wounded, hewn in pieces, slain. Who > wished this fatal issue to his soldier, but he who sealed him by such an > oath? (Scorpiace 4) In the following chapter Tertullian maintains that \\"martyrdom is good,\\" especially when the Christian faces the temptation to worship idols, which is forbidden. He goes on to write, > For martyrdom strives against and opposes idolatry. But to strive against > and oppose evil cannot be ought but good. . . . For martyrdom contends with > idolatry, not from some malice which they share, but from its own kindness; > for it delivers from idolatry. Who will not proclaim that to be good which > delivers from idolatry? What else is the opposition between idolatry and > martyrdom, than that between life and death? Life will be counted to be > martyrdom as much as idolatry to be death. . . . Thus martyrdoms also rage > furiously, but for salvation. God also will be at liberty to heal for > everlasting life by means of fires and swords, and all that is painful. > (Scorpiace 5) Tertullian has a long discussion on the certainty of persecutions and the reality of death for followers of Christ. Quoting extensively from the teachings of Jesus, Tertullian urges Christians towards faithful endurance in order to obtain final salvation with God. > When setting forth His chief commands, \\"Blessed are they who are persecuted > for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\\" [Matthew > 5:10] The following statement, indeed, applies first to all without > restriction, then especially to the apostles themselves: \\"Blessed shall you > be when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of > evil against you, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, since very > great is your reward in heaven; for so used their fathers to do even to the > prophets.\\" [Matthew 5:11‚Äì12] So that He likewise foretold their having to be > themselves also slain, after the example of the prophets. . . . The rule > about enduring persecution also would have had respect to us too, as to > disciples by inheritance, and, (as it were,) bushes from the apostolic seed. > For even thus again does He address words of guidance to the apostles: > \\"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves;\\" [Matthew 10:16] > and, \\"Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they > will scourge you in their synagogues; and you shall be brought before > governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the > Gentiles,\\" etc. [Matthew 10:17‚Äì18] Now when He adds, \\"But the brother will > deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and the children > shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death,\\" > [Matthew 10:21] He has clearly announced with reference to the others, (that > they would be subjected to) this form of unrighteous conduct, which we do > not find exemplified in the case of the apostles. For none of them had > experience of a father or a brother as a betrayer, which very many of us > have. Then He returns to the apostles: \\"And you shall be hated of all men > for my name's sake.\\" How much more shall we, for whom there exists the > necessity of being delivered up by parents too! Thus, by allotting this very > betrayal, now to the apostles, now to all, He pours out the same destruction > upon all the possessors of the name, on whom the name, along with the > condition that it be an object of hatred, will rest. But he who will endure > on to the end‚Äîthis man will be saved. By enduring what but > persecution‚Äîbetrayal‚Äîdeath? For to endure to the end is naught else than to > suffer the end. And therefore there immediately follows, \\"The disciple is > not above his master, nor the servant above his own lord;\\" [Matthew 10:24] > because, seeing the Master and Lord Himself was steadfast in suffering > persecution, betrayal and death, much more will it be the duty of His > servants and disciples to bear the same, that they may not seem as if > superior to Him, or to have got an immunity from the assaults of > unrighteousness, since this itself should be glory enough for them, to be > conformed to the sufferings of their Lord and Master; and, preparing them > for the endurance of these, He reminds them that they must not fear such > persons as kill the body only, but are not able to destroy the soul, but > that they must dedicate fear to Him rather who has such power that He can > kill both body and soul, and destroy them in hell [Matthew 10:28]. Who, > pray, are these slayers of the body only, but the governors and kings > aforesaid‚Äîmen, I suppose?

Fear not, therefore. When He adds, \\"You are of > more value than many sparrows,\\" He makes promise that we shall not in > vain‚Äîthat is, not without profit‚Äîfall to the ground if we choose to be > killed by men rather than by God. \\"Whosoever therefore will confess in me > before men, in him will I confess also before my Father who is in heaven; > and whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I deny also before my > Father who is in heaven.\\" [Matthew 10:32‚Äì34] [What] if a Christian is to be > stoned . . . burned . . . butchered . . . [or] put an end to by beasts . . . > ? He who will endure these assaults to the end, the same shall be saved. . . > . For what does He add after finishing with confession and denial? \\"Think > not that I have come to send peace on earth, but a sword,\\"‚Äîundoubtedly on > the earth. \\"For I have come to set a man at variance against his father, and > the daughter against her mother, and the mother-in-law against her daughter- > in-law.

[Matthew 10:22] So that this whole course of procedure > characteristic of the Lord's sword, which has been sent not to heaven, but > to earth, makes confession also to be there, which by enduring to the end is > to issue in the suffering of death. In the same manner, therefore, we > maintain that the other announcements too refer to the condition of > martyrdom. \\"He,\\" says Jesus, \\"who will value his own life also more than me, > is not worthy of me,\\" [Luke 14:26] ‚Äîthat is, he who will rather live by > denying, than die by confessing, me; and \\"he who finds his life shall lose > it; but he who loses it for my sake shall find it.\\" [Matthew 10:39] > Therefore indeed he finds it, who, in winning life, denies; but he who > thinks that he wins it by denying, will lose it in hell.

Or do > they also write differently from what they think‚Äîteachers using deceit, not > truth? Addressing the Christians of Pontus, Peter, at all events, says, \\"How > great indeed is the glory, if you suffer patiently, without being punished > as evildoers! For this is a lovely feature, and even hereunto were you > called, since Christ also suffered for us, leaving you Himself as an > example, that you should follow His own steps.\\" [1 Peter 2:20‚Äì21] And again: > \\"Beloved, be not alarmed by the fiery trial which is taking place among you, > as though some strange thing happened unto you.

(Scorpiace 9‚Äì12) Readings from the early church fathers such as these led patristic scholar David Bercot to conclude: \\"Since the early Christians believed that our continued faith and obedience are necessary for salvation, it naturally follows that they believed that a 'saved' person could still end up being lost [through apostasy].\\"Will the Real Heretics Please Stand Up: A New Look at Today's Evangelical Church in the Light of Early Christianity, 65. From his extensive research New Testament scholar B. J. Oropeza arrived at the same conclusion: \\"The church fathers would affirm the reality of the phenomenon of apostasy\\" (Paul and Apostasy, 13). For Opropeza's full discussion on \\"Apostasy and Perseverance in Church History,\\" see pages 1‚Äì13. Traditional Calvinists Thomas R. Schreiner and Ardel B. Caneday, in their book The Race Set Before Us: A Biblical Theology of Perseverance and Assurance (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 2001), recommend that readers see Oropeza's \\"excellent history of interpretation on the matter of perseverance and apostasy\\" (10, footnote 2). Primary theological perspectives There appears to be three primary perspectives on apostasy in Protestantism: Classical or Reformed Calvinism, Moderate Calvinism, Reformed Arminianism.See Oropeza, Paul and Apostasy, 1-34. One can find each of these views being represented in the book Four Views on Eternal Security (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2002), which deals with the topic of apostasy. The fourth view in this book, \\"Wesleyan Arminianism,\\" shares so much in common with \\"Reformed Arminianism\\" regarding apostasy that it does not seem to warrant a separate treatment. See also the Four Views on the Warning Passages in Hebrews (Grand Rapids: Kregel Publications, 2007). Classical or reformed Calvinism According to John Calvin (1509‚Äì1564), once the Holy Spirit brings a person to regeneration (i.e., gives them spiritual life) this experience cannot be lost and leads to final salvation with God.John Jefferson Davis, \\"The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine,\\" 217. Davis goes on to write: \\"This view is apparent in Calvin's comment on 1 John 3:9 ('No one born of God commits sin, for God's nature abides in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God'). Calvin argues that the apostle John 'plainly declares that the Spirit continues his grace in us to the last, so that inflexible perseverance is added to newness of life.' Can the fear and love of God be extinguished in the truly regenerate? No, because 'the seed, communicated when God regenerates his elect, as it is incorruptible, retains its virtue perpetually.' The 'seed' is the presence of God's new life in the believer.\\" (\\"The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine,\\" 217) In Calvin's theology, God has predestined to regenerate some (the elect) to eternal life and not to regenerate others (the non-elect) which ensures their eternal damnation (Calvin's Institutes 3.21:5; cf. 3.2:15‚Äì40, 14.6‚Äì9, 18‚Äì20, 24.6f.).Oropeza, Paul and Apostasy, 15. The elect may fall away from God's grace temporarily, but the truly elect will eventually be restored and not plunge into final apostasy. Calvin believed that \\"The Lord uses the fear of final apostasy in order to safeguard true believers against it. Only the ones who ignore the threat are in real danger of falling away.\\" Calvin viewed the passages on apostasy found in Hebrews (6:4‚Äì6; 10:26‚Äì29) as applying to those in the church having a false faith‚Äîreprobates (i.e., unbelievers) who have never experienced regeneration. John Jefferson Davis writes: > Even though Calvin believes that regeneration is irreversible . . . he does > not conclude that the Christian has any cause for spiritual complacency. > Persevering in God's grace requires, on the human side, \\"severe and arduous > effort.\\" . . . The believer needs to continually feed his soul on the > preaching of the Word and to grow in faith throughout the whole course of > life. Since it is easy for the believer to fall away for a time from the > grace of God, there is constant need for \\"striving and vigilance, if we > would persevere in the grace of God.\\" Calvin thus balances his theological > certitudes with pastoral warnings. . . . The believer must continually > exercise faith and obedience to make \\"his calling and election sure.\\"Davis, > \\"The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine,\\" 222. Others in the Reformed tradition followed Calvin's theology on election, regeneration, perseverance, and apostasy: Zacharias Ursinus (1534‚Äì1583); William Perkins (1558‚Äì1602);Oropeza, Paul and Apostasy, 15-16. John Owen (1616‚Äì1683);Oropeza, Paul and Apostasy, 17. John Gill (1697‚Äì1771);Oropeza, Paul and Apostasy, 20. Jonathan Edwards (1703‚Äì1758);Oropeza, Paul and Apostasy, 19. and George Whitefield (1714‚Äì1770).Oropeza, Paul and Apostasy, 19‚Äì20. The Reformed confessions such as the Canons of the Synod of Dort (1619) and the Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) also express views parallel with Calvin's theology.Davis, \\"The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine,\\" 222‚Äì223. Moderate Calvinism In his book, Reign of the Servant Kings: A Study of Eternal Security and the Final Significance of Man, Free Grace author Joseph Dillow seeks to chart a middle position between the Reformed Calvinist and Arminian position on apostasy.Reign of the Servant Kings, xvi. Dillow accepts \\"the Reformed position that those who are truly born again can never lose their salvation.\\" But he also accepts the Arminian position that the warning passages concerning apostasy in the New Testament (e.g., Hebrews 6) are directed to genuine Christians, not merely professing Christians who are in reality unbelievers as reformed Calvinists assert. There are real dangers in these warning passages, but contrary to the Arminian view, it \\"is not [the] loss of salvation but severe divine discipline (physical death or worse) in the present time and loss of reward, and even rebuke, at the judgment seat of Christ.\\"Reign of the Servant Kings, 22; cf. xvi, 20‚Äì21. Dillow, like other Free Grace adherents, disagrees with reformed Calvinists and Arminians in holding that saving faith in Christ must continue in order for a person to obtain final salvation with God.Norman Geisler believes that \\"Continued belief is not a condition for keeping one's salvation.\\" (\\"Moderate Calvinism,\\" Four Views on Eternal Security, 109). Zane Hodges says: \\". . . We miss the point to insist that true saving faith must necessarily continue. Of course, our faith in Christ should continue. But the claim that it absolutely must . . . has no support at all in the Bible\\" (Absolutely Free! A Biblical Reply to Lordship Salvation, 63). Charles Stanley writes, \\"To say that our salvation can be taken from us for any reason, whether it be sin or disbelief, is to ignore the plain meaning of this text [Ephesians 2:8‚Äì9]\\" (Eternal Security, 81). Dillow believes: \\"it is possible for true Christians to fail to persevere in faith and, in remote cases, even to deny the faith altogether (Hebrews 10:26, 35)\\" (Reign of the Servant Kings, 21). What a Christian \\"forfeits when he 'falls away' [into unbelief and apostasy] is not his eternal destiny but his opportunity to reign with Christ's metochoi [companions] in the coming kingdom\\" (The Reign of the Servant Kings, 202). Dillow comments, \\"Even though [Arminian] Robert Shank would not agree, it is definitely true that saving faith is 'the act of a single moment whereby all the benefits of Christ's life, death, and resurrection suddenly become the irrevocable possession of the individual, per se, despite any and all eventualities'\\" (The Reign of the Servant Kings, 202). For Dillow, any and all eventualities would include falling away from the Christian faith and to \\"cease believing.\\" (The Reign of the Servant Kings, 199). The prominent authors for the Moderate Calvinist perspective are: R. T. Kendall;Once Saved, Always Saved (1983, 1995). Zane C. Hodges;Absolutely Free! A Biblical Reply to Lordship Salvation (1989). Charles C. Ryrie;So Great Salvation: What it Means to Believe in Jesus Christ (1989, 1997). Charles Stanley;Eternal Security: Can You Be Sure? (1990). Norman L. Geisler;Chosen But Free: A Balanced View of Divine Election, 2nd edition (1999, 2001); also Four Views on Eternal Security, \\"Moderate Calvinism,\\" (2002). and Tony Evans.Totally Saved (2004). Reformed Arminianism Reformed Arminianism derives its name from pastor and theologian James Arminius (1560‚Äì1609). Right up until his death, Arminius was undecided as to whether a believer could commit apostasy.Arminius wrote: \\"My sentiments respecting the perseverance of the Saints are, that those persons who have been grafted into Christ by true faith, and have thus been made partakers of his life-giving Spirit, possess sufficient powers [or strength] to fight against Satan, sin, the world and their own flesh, and to gain the victory over these enemies ‚Äì yet not without the assistance of the grace of the same Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ also by his Spirit assists them in all their temptations, and affords them the ready aid of his hand; and, provided they stand prepared for the battle, implore his help, and be not wanting to themselves, Christ preserves them from falling. So that it is not possible for them, by any of the cunning craftiness or power of Satan, to be either seduced or dragged out of the hands of Christ. But I think it is useful and will be quite necessary in our first convention, [or Synod] to institute a diligent inquiry from the Scriptures, whether it is not possible for some individuals through negligence to desert the commencement of their existence in Christ, to cleave again to the present evil world, to decline from the sound doctrine which was once delivered to them, to lose a good conscience, and to cause Divine grace to be ineffectual. Though I here openly and ingenuously affirm, I never taught that a true believer can, either totally or finally fall away from the faith, and perish; yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such a kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding. On the other hand, certain passages are produced for the contrary doctrine [of unconditional perseverance] which are worthy of much consideration\\" (Works of Arminius, 2:219-220). William Nichols notes: \\"Arminius spoke nearly the same modest words when interrogated on this subject in the last Conference which he had with Gomarus [a Calvinist], before the states of Holland, on the 12th of Aug. 1609, only two months prior to his decease\\" (Works of Arminius, 1:665). B. J. Oropeza says, \\"Although Arminius denied having taught final apostasy in his Declaration of Sentiments, in the Examination of the Treatise of Perkins on the Order and Mode of Predestination he writes that a person who is being 'built' into the church of Christ may resist the continuation of this process. Concerning the believers, 'It may suffice to encourage them, if they know that no power or prudence can dislodge them from the rock, unless they of their own will forsake their position.' [Works of Arminius, 3:455, cf. 1:667] A believing member of Christ may become slothful, give place to sin, and gradually die altogether, ceasing to be a member. [Works of Arminius, 3:458] The covenant of God (Jeremiah 23) 'does not contain in itself an impossibility of defection from God, but a promise of the gift of fear, whereby they shall be hindered from going away from God so long as that shall flourish in their hearts.' If there is any consistency in Arminius' position, he did not seem to deny the possibility of falling away\\" (Paul and Apostasy, 16). However, he did affirm like Calvin that believers must continually exercise faith in order to obtain final salvation with God.Arminius writes: \\"God resolves to receive into favor those who repent and believe, and to save in Christ, on account of Christ, and through Christ, those who persevere [in faith], but to leave under sin and wrath those who are impenitent and unbelievers, and to condemn them as aliens from Christ\\" (Works of Arminius, 2:465; cf. 2:466). In another place he writes: \\"[God] wills that they, who believe and persevere in faith, shall be saved, but that those, who are unbelieving and impenitent, shall remain under condemnation\\" (Works of Arminius, 3:412; cf. 3:413). After the death of Arminius, the Remonstrants maintained their leader's view that the believer has power through the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit to be victorious over sin, Satan, and the world, and his uncertainty regarding the possibility of apostasy. This is evidenced in the fifth article drafted by its leaders in 1610.The article reads: That those who are incorporated into Christ by a true faith, and have thereby become partakers of his life-giving Spirit, have thereby full power to strive against Satan, sin, the world, and their own flesh, and to win the victory; it being well understood that it is ever through the assisting grace of the Holy Ghost; and that Jesus Christ assists them through his Spirit in all temptations, extends to them his hand, and if only they are ready for the conflict, and desire his help, and are not inactive, keeps them from falling, so that they, by not craft or power of Satan, can be misled nor plucked out of Christ's hand, according to the Word of Christ, John 10:28: 'Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.' But whether they are capable, through negligence, of forsaking again the first beginnings of their life in Christ, of again returning to this present evil world, of turning away from the holy doctrine which was delivered them, of losing a good conscience, of becoming devoid of grace, that must be more particularly determined out of the Holy Scripture, before we ourselves can teach it with full persuasion of our minds.(Philip Schaff, editor. The Creeds of Christendom Volume III: The Evangelical Protestant Creeds, \\"The Articles of the Remonstrants,\\" 3:548-549) Sometime between 1610, and the official proceeding of the Synod of Dort (1618), the Remonstrants became fully persuaded in their minds that the Scriptures taught that a true believer was capable of committing apostasy. They formalized their views in \\"The Opinion of the Remonstrants\\" (1618). Points three and four in the fifth article read: > True believers can fall from true faith and can fall into such sins as > cannot be consistent with true and justifying faith; not only is it possible > for this to happen, but it even happens frequently.

Also, \\"The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord\\" reads: \\"Above all, therefore, the false Epicurean delusion is to be earnestly censured and rejected, namely, that some imagine that faith and the righteousness and salvation which they have received can be lost through no sins or wicked deeds, not even through willful and intentional ones, but that a Christian although he indulges his wicked lusts without fear and shame, resists the Holy Ghost, and purposely engages in sins against conscience, yet none the less retains faith, God's grace, righteousness, and salvation. Against this pernicious delusion the following true, immutable, divine threats and severe punishments and admonitions should be often repeated and impressed upon Christians who are justified by faith: 1 Cor. 6:9: Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, etc., shall inherit the kingdom of God. Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5: They which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Rom. 8:13: If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die. Col. 3:6: For which thing's sake the wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience\\" (IV. Good Works, #31‚Äì32, obtained at http://bookofconcord.org/sd-goodworks.php) * Methodist Churches (Wesleyan- Arminianism) ** Evangelical Wesleyan Church ** The United Methodist ChurchCyclopaedia of Methodism (Philadelphia: Louis H. Everts, 1882): \\"Arminian churches . . . do not believe that those who are converted will necessarily be [finally] saved. They ground their belief further on the warnings which are given by our Savior and his apostles, in teaching the necessity of watchfulness and prayer, in the warnings against falling away contained in many passages of Scripture, and the express declaration that some had been made 'shipwreck of faith' and had fallen away. . . . The Methodist Churches, being Arminian in theology, totally reject the doctrine of the necessary perseverance of the saints, while at the same time they teach that the prayerful and obedient, while they remain in that condition, can never be separated from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. They believe it, however, to be necessary to use all diligence to make their 'calling and election sure'\\" (\\"Perseverance, Final,\\" 708‚Äì709). Leland Scott, in Encyclopedia of World Methodism, (Nashville: The United Methodist Publishing House, 1974): [John Wesley says] \\"Arminians hold, that a true believer may 'make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience;' that he may fall, not only foully, but finally, so as to perish forever.\\" (The Question, \\"What is an Arminian?\\" Answered. 1770). ... [According to Wesley] \\"a man may forfeit the free gift of God, either by sins of omission or commission.\\" (\\"What is an Arminian?\\" question 11) How important, therefore, for every believer to beware, \\"lest his heart be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin;' ... lest he should sink lower and lower, till he wholly fall away, till he become as salt that hath lost its savor: for if he thus sin willfully, after we have received the experimental 'knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins' ...\\" (Sermon on the Mount, IV, i, 8, 1747). ... Perseverance in grace, therefore, was conditioned upon the believer's persevering! Although the believer continued dependent upon atoning, redeeming grace throughout the course of his salvation, nevertheless‚Äîfor Wesley‚Äîsuch grace (as seen through Scripture) must be considered finally resistible, the Spirit could finally be quenched. Thus the believer is \\"saved from the fear, though not from the possibility, of falling away from the grace of God\\" (Sermon 1. ii. 4.) (\\"Perseverance, Final,\\" 1888‚Äì1889). Mark B. Stokes says: \\"Other people say, 'once in grace always in grace.' ... But we United Methodist believe that we are still free to turn away from Christ even while we are Christians. ... The Bible is filled with examples of people who started out well and ended up tragically. ... We experience no state of grace which is beyond the possibility of falling\\" (Major United Methodist Beliefs, Revised and Enlarged [Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1990], 117‚Äì118). Article XII‚ÄîOf Sin After Justification: \\"Not every sin willingly committed after justification is the sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore, the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after justification. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned who say they can no more sin as long as they live here; or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent. (The Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church, obtained at ) Charles Yrigoyen writes: \\"Article XII addresses the problem of our disobedience and sin after we have been prepared by grace and have accepted God's offer of pardon and forgiveness (justifying grace) by faith. ... After justification, any of us 'may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again and amend our lives.' In this Article there is a plain denial of what some call 'eternal security' or 'once saved, always saved,' which claims that once people have received the saving grace of God, they cannot lose their salvation\\" (Belief Matters: United Methodism's Doctrinal Standards [Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2001], 85). ** Free Methodist ChurchSee \\"Does Doctrine Matter?\\" By Donald N.

Nevertheless, secondary sources from recognized Church of Christ scholars clearly affirm conditional security and the possibility of apostasy. For example see James Thompson's Paideia Commentary on the New Testament: Hebrews (chapters 2, 3, 6, 10, 12); Jack Cottrell's College Press NIV Commentary on Romans (Romans 8:12‚Äì13; 11:19‚Äì21; 14:13‚Äì23; 16:17‚Äì20); The Faith Once for All (pages 375‚Äì382). See also The College Press NIV Commentary Series which is done by Church of Christ commentators. * Roman Catholic ChurchThe Catholic teaching on apostasy is found in The Catechism of the Catholic Church (first published in the United States in 1994, and the Second Edition in 2003). According to Pope John Paul II it is \\"presented as a full, complete exposition of Catholic doctrine\\" (Catechism, \\"Apostolic Letter\\"). See sections 161‚Äì162; and 1849‚Äì1861, obtained at http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/ccc_toc2.htm Theologians who affirmed the possibility of apostasy Augustine Augustine (354‚Äì430) Augustine believed \\"that God's elect will certainly persevere to the end and attain eternal salvation.\\"John Jefferson Davis, \\"The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine,\\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 34:2 (June 1991), 213. However, according to Reformed scholar John Jefferson Davis, > Augustine does not believe that the Christian can in this life know with > infallible certitude that he is in fact among the elect and that he will > finally persevere. According to Augustine \\"it is uncertain whether anyone > has received this gift [of perseverance] so long as he is still alive.\\" The > believer's life in this world is a state of trial, and he who seems to stand > must take heed lest he fall. . . . In fact one's justification and baptismal > regeneration could be rejected and lost through sin and > unbelief.\\"Perseverance of the Saints,\\" 213-214. Augustine's views \\"set the parameters for Aquinas, for the Council of Trent, and for the Roman Catholic tradition generally down to the present day.\\"Davis, \\"Perseverance of the Saints,\\" 214. So Oropeza: [According to Augustine] \\"The graces of justification and salvation could still be lost\\" (Paul and Apostasy, 10). Thomas Aquinas (1225‚Äì1274) Like Augustine, Thomas Aquinas held \\"that one who has been justified by grace stands continually in need of the grace of God, since the justified can turn away and be finally lost.\\"Davis, \\"Perseverance of the Saints,\\" 214 Martin Luther (1483‚Äì1546) Martin Luther Like Augustine, Martin Luther believed that salvation or \\"regeneration occurred through the waters of baptism.\\"Davis, \\"Perseverance of the Saints,\\" 215. \\"But,\\" noted the Reformer, \\"all of us do not remain with our baptism. Many fall away from Christ and become false Christians.\\" In his commentary on 2 Peter 2:22 he writes as follows on apostates in the Church: \\"Through baptism these people threw out unbelief, had their unclean way of life washed away, and entered into a pure life of faith and love. Now they fall away into unbelief and their own works, and they soil themselves again in filth.\\"Davis, \\"Perseverance of the Saints,\\" 215-216. Luther held that even if one has experienced the justifying grace of God through faith in Christ, they still \\"can lose that justification through unbelief or false confidence in works.\\"Davis, \\"Perseverance of the Saints,\\" 216. In his comments on Galatians 5:4, \\"Ye are fallen from grace,\\" Luther writes, \\"To fall from grace means to lose the atonement, the forgiveness of sins, the righteousness, liberty, and life which Jesus has merited for us by His death and resurrection. To lose the grace of God means to gain the wrath and judgment of God, death, the bondage of the devil, and everlasting condemnation.\\"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (1535), translated by Theodore Graebner (Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, 1949). Obtained from Project Wittenberg at http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/gal/web/gal5-01.html On Galatians 5:1, \\"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,\\" Luther comments: \\"Our liberty is founded on Christ Himself, who sits at the right hand of God and intercedes for us. Therefore our liberty is sure and valid as long as we believe in Christ. As long as we cling to Him with a steadfast faith we possess His priceless gifts [forgiveness of sins and eternal life are two that Luther mentions in the previous paragraph]. But if we are careless and indifferent we shall lose them. It is not without good reason that Paul urges us to watch and to stand fast. He knew that the devil delights in taking this liberty away from us\\" (Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians). Stephen Pfurtner cites Luther's commentary on Hebrews 3:16, where Lurther warns, \\"We must therefore fear lest through apostasy we should lose again the beginning of a new creation\\" (Luther and Aquinas on Salvation, 142). Martin Luther shared with Augustine, Aquinas, and \\"the Roman Catholic Church of his day the belief that the grace of baptismal regeneration and justification could be lost.\\" Philip Melanchthon (1497‚Äì1560) Philip Melanchthon Philip Melanchthon wrote a commentary on Romans in 1540. On this particular passage: \\"Brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live\\" (Rom. 8:12-13, ESV), Melanchthon calls this \\"teaching about the new obedience.\\" Philipp Melanchthon, Commentary on Romans, translated by Fred Kramer [Concordia Publishing House, 2010], 172. Paul gives this teaching so people \\"born again by faith\\" \\"may understand what the obedience in the saints is like, and what is the nature of the sin on account of which they fall from grace and lose faith and the Holy Spirit.\\"Melanchthon, Commentary on Romans, 172. This new obedience \\"acknowledges God, obeys him, and fights against the impulses of the flesh which carry a person along against the will of God.\\"Melanchthon, Commentary on Romans, 172. When Paul says \\"'If you mortify the actions of the flesh by the Spirit,' he testifies that there are in saints some sinful actions, namely, concupiscence [i.e., strong sexual desire; lust]; various evil desires; . . . being inflamed with desire for revenge; hatred; avarice [i.e., greed]; etc.\\" Melanchthon, Commentary on Romans, 173. These sins do not lead to \\"eternal death\\" when the saints fight against these sins by faith through Christ their mediator. It is > when those who had been sanctified indulge in and obey such desires, do not > fight against them, and are without repentance. Such persons lose faith and > the Holy Spirit and are condemned to eternal death unless they return to > repentance. Thus when David had become an adulterer, he was without faith > and the Holy Spirit, and would have been lost if he had not afterward been > restored through repentance. Here belongs what is said in this passage: \\"If > you will live according to the flesh,\\" that is, if you will obey the evil > desires, \\"you will die.\\" The same thought is frequently repeated in > Scripture. . . . 1 Cor. 6[:9]: \\"Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor > idolaters, ... will inherit the kingdom of God.\\" Gal. 5[:21]: \\"Those who do > such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\\" Col. 3[:6]: \\"On account > of which the wrath of God is coming on the disobedient . . .\\" Melanchthon, > Commentary on Romans, 173. Later in the commentary Melanchthon says, \\"He > [Jesus] sits at the right hand of the Father and saves the believers with > divine power, sustains and vivifies them, if only we do not fall away from > him\\" (Commentary on Romans, 183). In his Annotations on the First Epistle to > the Corinthians, Melanchthon comments on 1 Corinthians 10:1 (which seem to > take in the fuller context of verses 2‚Äì12) appear to support apostasy. He > says Paul \\"urges them to persevere in the justification which is taking > place. His argument is by example. There are also the histories or examples > of prophecy in Scripture. The fathers were rejected because of their sins, > idolatry, laziness, lust, unbelief, etc. We must therefore be on guard lest > the same sins cheat us of salvation\\" (109). Puritan John Goodwin demonstrated that Melanchthon fully supported the possibility of Christians committing apostasy: > \\"There are two errors . . . of fanatic men, which must briefly be confuted, > who conceit that men regenerated cannot lapse‚Äù or fall, \\"and that though > they do fall, and this against the light of their conscience, yet they are > righteous,\\" or in a state of justification. \\"This madness is to be > condemned, and both instances and sayings from the scriptures of the > apostles and prophets are opposed to it.

And having cited, upon the said account, > Matthew 12:43-44; 2 Peter 2:20-21; 1 Corinthians 10:12; Revelation 2:5., he > subjoins: \\"These and the like sayings, being spoken of regenerate men, > testify that they may fall, and that in case they fall against their > consciences they please not God unless they be converted.\\" Elsewhere thus: > \\"Whereas it hath been said that sins remain in the regenerate, it is > necessary that a difference be made; for certain it is that they who rush > into sinful practices against conscience do not continue in grace, nor > retain faith, righteousness, or the Holy Spirit; neither can faith stand > with an evil purpose of heart against conscience.\\" A little after: \\"But that > they fall from grace, and shed faith and the Holy Spirit, and become guilty > of the wrath of God and of eternal punishment, who commit sin against > conscience, many sayings\\" in the Scriptures \\"clearly testify;\\" to which > purpose he cites Galatians 5:19; 1 Corinthians 6:9, etc. . . .

Thomas Helwys (1550‚Äì1616) Thomas Helwys was one of the joint founders of the Baptist denomination along with John Smyth. After breaking with Smyth in 1610, Helwys wrote \\"A Declaration of Faith of English People Remaining at Amsterdam in Holland in 1611.\\"Joe Early Jr., The Life and Writings of Thomas Helwys, 64. Early says the \\"purpose of A Declaration of Faith was to differentiate the beliefs of Helwys congregation from that of Smyths\\" (Life and Writings of Thomas Helwys, 64). This Declaration is \\"Recognized by the majority of Baptist scholars as the first true English Baptist confession of the faith\\" (Early, The Life and Writings of Thomas Helwys, 64). Helwys clearly communicates his stance regarding apostasy in point seven of the Declaration: > Men may fall away from the grace of GOD (Hebrews 12:15) and from the truth, > which they have received and acknowledged (Hebrews 10:26) after they have > tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the HOLY SPIRIT, and > have tasted of the good word of GOD, and of the powers of the world to come > (Hebrews 6:4, 5). And after they have escaped from the filthiness of the > World, may be tangled again therein and overcome (2 Peter 2:20). A righteous > man may forsake his righteousness and perish (Ezekiel 18:24, 26). Therefore > let no man presume to think that because he has, or once had grace, > therefore he shall always have grace. But let all men have assurance, that > if they continue to the end, they will be saved. Let no man then presume; > but let all work out their salvation with fear and trembling.Early, The Life > and Writings of Thomas Helwys, 69-70. Simon Episcopius (1583‚Äì1643) Simon Episcopius Simon Episcopius was the leader of the Remonstrants and primary author of \\"The Opinions of the Remonstrants 1618\\" and \\"The Arminian Confession of 1621.\\"Keith D. Stanglin says \\"that the Opinions of the Remonstrants, [was] drawn up by Episcopius in 1618\\" (\\"Arminius and Arminianism: An Overview,\\" 17, as found in Arminius, Arminianism, and Europe: Jacobus Arminius (1559/60-1609)). Mark A. Ellis, says the Remonstrants \\"selected Episcopius and two others to write it [the Confession] but in the end, he did the work alone\\" (\\"Introduction,\\" The Arminian Confession of 1621, ix). In the Confession the Remonstrants were \\"persuaded that none is to be easily condemned, or blotted out of the register of Christians who holds fast to faith in Christ, and in hope of the good things promised by him, [and who] seek from the heart to obey his commands . . . .\\"The Arminian Confession of 1621, Preface, 30.

Still others argue that the biblical warnings against apostasy > are real and that believers maintain the freedom, at least potentially, to > reject God's salvation.Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary, \\"Apostasy,\\" 87. McKnight says that \\"apostasy ought not to be used as a continual threat so much as an occasional warning of the disaster that Christians may bring upon themselves if they do not examine themselves. As a warning, apostasy can function as a moral injunction that strengthens commitment to holiness as well as the need to turn in complete trust to God in Christ through his Spirit.\\"Dictionary of Theological Interpretation of the Bible, 60. Some argue that the desire for salvation shows one does not have \\"an evil, unbelieving heart\\" leading to apostasy.Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary, 87-88 As Fink puts it, \\"persons worried about apostasy should recognize that conviction of sin in itself is evidence that one has not fallen away.\\"Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary, 87 Penalties In classical canon law, apostasy a fide, defined as total repudiation of the Christian faith, was considered as different from a theological standpoint from heresy, but subject to the same penalty of death by fire by decretist jurists. The influential 13th century theologian Hostiensis recognized three types of apostasy. The first was conversion to another faith, which was considered traitorous and could bring confiscation of property or even the death penalty. The second and third, which was punishable by expulsion from home and imprisonment, consisted of breaking major commandments and breaking the vows of religious orders, respectively. A decretal by Boniface VIII classified apostates together with heretics with respect to the penalties incurred. Although it mentioned only apostate Jews explicitly, it was applied to all apostates, and the Spanish Inquisition used it to persecute both the Marano Jews, who had been converted to Christianity by force, and to the Moriscos who had professed to convert to Christianity from Islam under pressure. Temporal penalties for Christian apostates have fallen into disuse in the modern era.

He served as Grand Chancellor to Hugh of Provence and Lothar II, both Kings of Italy in the 10th century. During his time as bishop, Atto was known for his devotion to the welfare of the people in his diocese, both temporal and spiritual, and the vigor with which he attacked ecclesial corruption. He wrote several works in his lifetime. His major compositions include Polypticum, a treatise on the morality of Italy in the day; De pressuris ecclesiasticis, an essay regarding ecclesiastical authority; and the Capitulare, a collection of canon law from his area, including some of the False Decretals, augmented by his own additions of ecclesiastic law. A small selection of his sermons survives in written form. He died in 961. Early life Atto was born around 885 CE and lived approximately seventy-five years, dying on December 31, 961 CE.W. C. Korfmacher, ‚ÄúAtto of Vercelli,‚Äù in New Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 1 (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967), 1032. He was born into a noble Lombard family;Korfmacher, 1032. his father was man named Aldegarius.George Alan Willhauck, ‚ÄúThe Letters of Atto, Bishop of Vercelli: Text, Translation, and Commentary‚Äù (Ph. D dissertation, Tufts University, 1984), 3. Atto's writing later in life shows a mastery of Latin and Greek ‚Äì Latin being the only common language in Italy by the 9th Century ‚Äì which indicates that his education must have been substantial, in line with the social standing of his family.Korfmacher, 1032. Little else is known about Atto's childhood or ecclesiastic career beginnings. Episcopate of Vercelli Atto's rise to become bishop of Vercelli was the consequence of a violent attack on the city of Pavia.Korfmacher, 1032. The invading army was Hungarian in origin.Willhauck, 3. In 924 CE, forces entered Italy, descending upon Pavia on March 12.Korfmacher, 1032. Ragembert, Atto's predecessor as bishop of Vercelli, was in Pavia at the time, and perished in the event.Korfmacher, 1032. This left the bishopric of Vercelli open for Atto, who must have been a prominent member of the clergy in Vercelli already to be eligible for the position. The episcopate put Atto in contact with many powerful men, including Hugh of Provence, King of Italy; Lothar II, King of Italy and Hugh's son; and the margrave Berengar II.Korfmacher, 1032. He served as Grand Chancellor to both Hugh of Provence and Lothar II during their respective reigns over the Kingdom of Italy.Korfmacher, 1032. His position with Lothar II began in May of 950.Willhauck, 5. Atto did not agree with Lothar's unjust means of ruling, but was unsuccessful in making any real changes, as he could only council the young king.Willhauck, 5. Religious Zeal and Church Corruption Atto was highly concerned with the welfare of the people in his diocese, both spiritual and secular. He disapproved of the use of horoscopes to direct life choices such as marriage.Bernadette Filotas, Pagan Survivals, Superstitions, and Popular Cultures in Early Medieval Pastoral Literature (Toronto: PIMS, 2005), 133. He did not, however, prohibit the use of astrology in his flock completely, as he said that God created stars for the use of man.Filotas, 133. As a result, he encouraged the practical application of astrology as a method of telling time, navigating, and predicting the weather, for the benefit of his people who relied upon astrological calculations for their livelihoods.Filotas, 133. He worried extensively about the corruption of his flock: in an Easter sermon, he discredited public entertainment such as plays, particularly during the weeks of Lent and Easter.Filotas, 84. He claimed public entertainment was fabricated by the infamous ‚Äúdemons‚Äù Liberus and Venus as a device to incite depravity.Filotas, 84. His spiritual zeal was more famously directed toward the church itself.Willhauck, 21. Atto was concerned with the clergy in Northern Italy.Willhauck, 21. Although he noticed pagan superstitions in his parishioners, he believed these superstitions to be the fault of the clergy, who were ‚Äúclearly not particularly devoted to their priestly duties.Willhauck, 21. He readily prescribed punishment for priests who were misleading or neglecting their flocks.Willhauck, 28. Atto also wished to rectify the growing problem of sexuality within the priesthood.Willhauck, 116. He had discovered that many clerics, who were, by the decree of the Council of Nicaea, supposed to be celibate, were fornicating with women.Willhauck, 116. Such clerics often made excuses as to why they needed women around, but Atto saw through these.Willhauck, 117. Although he didn‚Äôt threaten any punishment to the offending ecclesiastics, he did strongly suggest that they should stop.Willhauck, 117. More likely than not, his influence was not very strong on matters that were so tied to human nature, such as this.Willhauck, 117. Atto opposed several other practices within the Church. In the early Middle Ages, it was profitable for clergymen to sell holy cloth, i.e. altar furnishings or priest‚Äôs clothing, to families who wished to carry their dead to the grave with a liturgical article for the purpose of ensuring the dead a safe trip into the afterlife.Filotas, 324 Atto did not disapprove of this due to the actual ‚Äòselling‚Äô of holy articles, however.Filotas, 325. It was said that once restored to its original purpose, the cloth used to bear the dead would be tainted and pollute the altar and Mass it was meant to serve.Filotas, 324. Atto thus saw the appropriation of holy cloth during funeral services as a fault of the clergy: in his opinion, the ecclesiastics who performed this practice were unaware of the appropriate way to treat articles that are instrumental in sacred worship.Filotas, 325 In the centuries before Atto's time, clerics from the lowest to the highest ranks were known to take counsel from magicians, or seers.Filotas, 285. This practice ‚Äì and the general fear that clergymen were corrupted by or becoming magicians ‚Äì died out in the middle of the 9th Century.Filotas, 285 Atto inexplicably decided to warn against the consultation of magicians and seers in all ranks of the clergy during his time as Bishop of Vercelli, although there is little evidence that it was still widely regarded as a problem.Filotas, 285. Works Atto of Vercelli's literary canon survives in partial form, and is largely instructional.Willhauck, 9. His sermons can be found in contemporary anthologies, such as Atto's ‚Äúon Palm Sunday (Sermon VII)‚Äù in Ray C. Petry's No Uncertain Sound: Sermons that Shaped the Pulpit Tradition, published in 1948.Ray C. Petry, ed, No Uncertain Sound: Sermons that Shaped the Pulpit Tradition (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1948), 115. Alongside his larger works, Atto also wrote The Exposition on the Epistles of Saint Paul, a commentary that would have been used to educate the clergymen of Vercelli.Willhauck, 9. A small collection of Atto's Epistolae, or letters, has been preserved, probably compiled from the codices of Vercelli and the Vatican library.Benedetta Valtorta, Clavis Scriptorum Latinorum Medii Aevi. Auctores Italiae, (700-1000), (Florence: SISMEL ‚Äì Edizioni del Galluzzo, 2006), 49. This collection includes nine letters that Atto wrote, and two directed to Atto from other authors.Valtorta, 49. De pressuris ecclesiasticis The earliest of his principal compositions, De pressuris ecclesiasticis was written around 940 CE.Korfmacher, 1032. It is sometimes referred to as its full name, De pressuris eclesiasticis libellus, meaning ‚ÄúBook on the Pressures of the Church.‚ÄùValtorta, 48. It contains discourse regarding the jurisdiction of the Church and its law, and argues against the maltreatment of laypeople.A. K. Zeigler, \\"Medieval Literature,\\" in New Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 9 (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967), 600. Alongside this, it disproves accusations against the clergy, including matters regarding the ordination of ecclesiastics, especially to the position of bishops, as well as the unwarranted expropriation of church property after a bishop's death.Korfmacher, 1032. Polypticum Sometimes referred to as Perpendiculum, meaning ‚Äúperpendicular,‚Äù ‚Äúline,‚Äù or ‚Äúplummet,‚Äù this work seems to have been completed near the end of Atto's life, perhaps in his last months.Korfmacher, 1032. It may have been sent to a friend or colleague of Atto's, who wrote the foreword using Latin similar to that of Atto, before being published.Korfmacher, 1032. It has been suggested that only the first two drafts of the work are in the hand of Atto himself, and that the aforementioned friend or colleague of Atto may have forged his hand for the later edition of the text.Valtorta, 55. The work itself discusses the troubling political atmosphere of the Kingdom of Italy, albeit in an obscure way.Zeigler, 600. It satirizes the political struggles between princes and nobility in the time period, and shows Atto's distaste and pessimism about the age in which he lived.Willhauck, 12. Canones: Ecclesiastic Law The name of Atto's compilation of canon law is debatable. Linda Fowler-Magerl calls it the long-winded Capitula canonum excerptarum de diversis conciliis decretalibus statutis atque epistolis congruentium ad forense iudicium tempore domini Attonis episcopi, which translates roughly to ‚ÄúExcerpt chapters of canons about the different decretal statute councils and the corresponding letters to the legal judgment in the time of the lord Bishop Atto.‚ÄùLinda Flowler-Magerl, Clavis Canonum: Selected Canon Law Collections before 1140 (Hanover: Hahnsche, 2005), 74. W. C. Korfmacher uses the shortened Canones statutaque Vercellensis Ecclesiae, roughly meaning ‚ÄúCanons and Statutes of the Church of Vercelli.‚ÄùKorfmacher, 1032. Paul Collins prefers the abbreviated Capitulare, simply meaning ‚Äúcapitulary.‚ÄùPaul Collins, The Birth of the West: Rome, Germany, France, And the Creation of Europe in the Tenth Century (New York: PublicAffairs, 2013), 344. It is clear in their writing, however, that Collins, Korfmacher, and Fowler-Magerl reference the same work, namely Atto's compilation of and additions to ecclesiastic law. In this work, Atto assembled preexisting law from multiple resources: the decrees and letters of several popes, decrees from up to thirteen different councils, and the canon of Theodulf of Orl√©ans.Willhauck, 9. Portions of the decretals used are from a collection known as the False Decretals or Collectio Isidori Mercatoris.Suzanne F. Wemple, \\"The Canonical Resources of Atto of Vercelli (926-960),\\" Traditio 26 (1970), 335. Some say that Atto's compilation deals exclusively with legislation in his diocese in Northern Italy.Korfmacher, 1032. The collection as a whole generally discusses legislation surrounding clerical discipline and lifestyle.Fowler-Magerl, 74. For example, this set of canon law demands clerics to be very well versed in scripture and ecclesiastic law, including knowing the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed verbatim.Collins, 344. It requires clerics to be able to preach and celebrate Mass in Latin.Collins, 344. It prohibits economic actions such as leasing property, acquiring interest on loans, and general business transactions.Collins, 344. It also castigates those who renounce their faith for the worship of false idols, which Atto found to be a hazard to orthodoxy in his flock.Filotas, 105. As always, Atto devoted some of his efforts in canon law towards the greater good of his congregation: his collection included the requirement of clerics to bury their parishioners, and to be able to teach them both reading and writing.Collins, 344.

It was completed in 1895, updated in 1929, taken out of rail service in 1968, and converted to bicycle and pedestrian use in 2014. The largest single span is , with the entire bridge spanning . It took its name from the defunct Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway, which was nicknamed the \\"Big Four Railroad\\". Access to the Big Four Bridge is limited to pedestrian and bicycle use. A pedestrian ramp on the Kentucky side was opened on February 7, 2013. The original approaches that carried rail traffic onto the main spans were first removed in 1969, earning the Big Four Bridge the nickname \\"Bridge That Goes Nowhere\\". The George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge downstream, which carries U.S. 31 across the river, was previously the only bridge allowing bicyclists and pedestrians to travel between Louisville and the neighboring Indiana cities of New Albany, Clarksville, and Jeffersonville. In February 2011, Kentucky and Indiana announced that the two states, along with the City of Jeffersonville, would allocate $22 million in funding to complete the Big Four Bridge project, creating a pedestrian and bicycle path to link Louisville and Jeffersonville. Indiana would spend up to $8 million and the City of Jeffersonville would provide $2 million in matching dollars to pay for construction of a ramp to the Big Four Bridge. Kentucky pledged $12 million to replace the deck on the bridge and connect it to the spiral ramp that was completed in Waterfront Park. On February 7, 2013, the Louisville ramp was opened for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. Initially planned for August 2013, the Jeffersonville ramp opened on May 20, 2014. Description The Big Four Bridge is a six-span bridge, totaling long, with a clearance of . The northernmost span is a riveted, 8-panel Parker through truss. The next three spans are long, and are riveted, 16-panel Pennsylvania through trusses. The two southern spans are riveted, 10-panel Parker through trusses. It carried a single track of railway. History unissued share of the Louisville and Jeffersonville Bridge Company Photo of Big Four Bridge in Baird's History of Clark County, Indiana, published in 1909 The Big Four Bridge was first conceived in Jeffersonville in 1885 by various city interests. The Louisville and Jeffersonville Bridge Company was formed in 1887 to construct the Big Four Bridge, after a charter by the state of Indiana; Kentucky also chartered the company in 1888. The riverboat industry, a big economic factor in Jeffersonville, had requested that the bridge be built further upstream from the Falls of the Ohio, but the United States Army Corps of Engineers approved the building site, even after the vocal protestations. Construction Construction began on October 10, 1888. The Big Four Bridge would be the only Louisville bridge with serious accidents during its building; thirty-seven individuals died during its construction. The first twelve died while working on a pier foundation when a caisson that was supposed to hold back the river water flooded, drowning the workers. Another four men died a few months after that when a wooden beam broke while working on a different pier caisson. The Big Four Bridge had one of the biggest bridge disasters in the United States, occurring on December 15, 1893 when a construction crane was dislodged by a severe wind, causing the falsework support of a truss to be damaged and the truss‚Äîwith forty-one workers on it‚Äîto fall into the Ohio River. Twenty of the workers survived, but twenty-one died. The accident almost cost more lives, as a ferry crossing the Ohio River just barely missed being hit by the truss. Hours later, a span next to the damaged span also fell into the river, but was unoccupied at the time, causing no injuries. As a result, falsework was longitudely reinforced to prevent further occurrences, and also to prevent strong winds from causing similar damage by using special bracing on the bottom frame of the truss. Also, a new rule was enforced: \\"never trust a bolted joint any longer than is necessary to put a riveted one in place\\". The Belle of Louisville crossing under the Bridge in the 2008 Great Steamboat Race The Big Four Bridge was finally completed in September 1895. Due to the various accidents, the Louisville and Jeffersonville Bridge Company was financially strapped after building the bridge, and later in 1895 sold it to the Indianapolis-based Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway, also known as the Big Four Railroad. This gave the railway its first entry into the Louisville market, although the railroad would have likely used the bridge even if they had not bought it, as they desired access to Louisville. Rail operation One effect of the opening of the Big Four Bridge was increased transportation of freight by rail, significantly decreasing the number of packet boats that at one time crossed the Ohio River by the dozens. On February 19, 1904, a Baltimore and Ohio train accidentally crossed the Big Four Bridge, due to engineer Dick Foreman falling asleep and going the wrong way at Otisco, Indiana. The fireman kept shoveling coal and did not pay attention. It was the conductor that finally noticed the error midway across the Big Four Bridge. The wayward train had to back up all the way back to Otisco. On September 12, 1905, the first interurban crossed the Big Four Bridge. In January 1918, two interurbans collided on the Big Four Bridge, killing three and injuring twenty aboard. Due to the increasing weight of the rail traffic, contracts were finalized in June 1928 to build a bigger Big Four Bridge, which opened on June 25, 1929. The new Big Four Bridge was built on the piers of the old bridge, a \\"novel building process\\", as it sped up the time necessary to build the new bridge; the old one served to reinforce the new one as it was being built. The old piers would still be used, but the falsework was entirely removed. During construction, the Big Four Bridge's usual rail traffic was routed over the Kentucky & Indiana Terminal Bridge. The interurbans that used the Big Four Bridge would instead disembark at Sellersburg, Indiana and have the passengers board buses into Louisville for the duration of the Big Four's reconstruction. Adjacent Highway Bridge In 1961 the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge was built to carry I-65 over the Ohio River. Because of the location of the Big Four Bridge and the growth of the Kennedy Interchange, the interchange had to avoid the columns that were on the approach to the bridge, causing the interchange to have several two-lane ramps rather than a single stretch of highway, and helped earn the nickname Spaghetti Junction. Ownership In 1988 Oscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, contacted Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson to inquire about buying the bridge to dismantle it and reassemble in Costa Rica, as he believed it would be cheaper to import the bridge than build a new one. At the time the city did not actually own the bridge, and the plan never went through. Post-railway use 1975 picture of bridge The Big Four Bridge fell into disuse after the Big Four Railroad's parent company, the New York Central Railroad, was merged into the Penn Central in 1968. The Big Four Bridge's former traffic was then routed over Louisville's Fourteenth Street Bridge. By 1969 both approach spans had been removed and sold for scrap. As a result, the Big Four Bridge became the first Louisville bridge to fall out of use, and gained the nickname \\"Bridge That Goes Nowhere\\". During the 1970s and 1980s, local radio station WLRS-102 FM lit up the Big Four Bridge as part of their \\"Bridge the Gap\\" Christmas promotion, which was used as a fund raiser for needy local families. Some of the lights spelled out \\"LRS 102\\". After unsuccessful litigation to stop the project, the Big Four Bridge was converted into a pedestrian and bicycle bridge as part of Louisville Waterfront Park and the ongoing revitalization of the Louisville riverfront. This conversion had been proposed and planned since the 1990s. In February 2013, pedestrians were allowed to access the completed bridge from the ramp on the Kentucky side. The Indiana ramp opened on May 20, 2014. Lighting along the bridge is required for safety and had been redesigned to please nearby residents. Originally, the lighting was to be similar to those on the Kentucky side, which has computer-controlled lights that can show various colors. The Indiana construction also had to be cautious of historic properties. During Thunder Over Louisville, the Big Four Bridge sets the limit on how close private boats can get to the fireworks, which are centered three bridges away on the George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge. The Waterfront Development Corporation spent $500,000 in upgrades to the Louisville Waterfront Park near the bridge, which took place from late 2015 to early 2016. Improvements included additional landscaping, a new path west from the ramp, and a plaza underneath the bridge. Fires Closeup of May 7, 2008 fire Between its closing as a rail bridge and its reopening as a pedestrian span, the bridge has seen occasional fires; two in the 1970s, one in 1987 and one in 2008. In 1987 Christmas lights posted on the bridge to promote a toy drive started the fire; both the Jeffersonville and Louisville Fire Departments fought six to eight hours to put out the blaze. On May 7, 2008 the bridge caught fire a quarter-mile (400 m) north of the Louisville end, shortly after noon, above the Ohio River; suspected to have started from an electrical problem. This fire was more troublesome due to the age and condition of the bridge; the wood trusses on the bridge were unsafe for firefighters to scale, due to the fire on the bridge ten years before. Louisville Fire & Rescue chief Greg Frederick decided that firefighters were not to be sent onto the bridge; a boat from the Harrods Creek Fire Department was used to put out the fire, as Louisville's fire boat did not have a hose that could reach the blaze on the bridge. It took two and a half hours to control the fire. Navigation lights used for the heavy barge traffic were being changed at the time of the report. The Coast Guard shut down river traffic for about a mile around the bridge due to falling debris. An official determination on the cause of the fire was expected in June 2008.

Once the Kyoto Protocol is set aside it is clear that there are better options available. One such approach is the McKibbin- Wilcoxen Blueprint which is outlined in this article. They argue that Kyoto Protocol-based carbon-trading systems are too inflexible/brittle to attract developing countries (particularly China & India). A better system would need to be flexible enough to refine outcomes over time (as new data become available).

The episode was directed by Jack Bender, and written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. It first aired on April 5, 2006, on ABC. In flashbacks, Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes is in a mental institution, where he deals with an imaginary friend, Dave. Libby also has a brief flashback in this episode, revealing that she attended the institution along with Hurley. The island events in the present day have Hurley seeing Dave on the island, while other survivors confront \\"Henry Gale\\" (Michael Emerson) after his stated backstory is revealed to be false. The episode addresses a fan theory which considered the events of the series to be hallucinations or dreams. The character of Dave was written as both a side of Hurley who denied his problems and an analogue to Hurley's disappeared father, and his scenes were filmed so that his reveal as imaginary would be a plot twist. Plot Flashback Hurley (Jorge Garcia) is in a mental institution, where he is friends with Dave (Evan Handler), who tells Hurley to ignore the doctors, avoid his medication, and try to escape. One day, Hurley's doctor, Dr. Brooks (Bruce Davison), proves to Hurley that Dave is not real, by taking a photo of the two, and then showing Hurley that Dave is not in the picture. Later that night, Dave wakes Hurley up to escape with him from the institute, suggesting that the photo was doctored. Dave hops out of a window, but Hurley confronts him and declares that Dave is not real, and shuts the window on him before going back to bed. A later flashback reveals that during the moment Dr. Brooks took the picture of Hurley and Dave, another patient was staring at Hurley from across the room, Libby (Cynthia Watros), which explains why Hurley has had this faint recognition of Libby while on the island. On the island Hurley confesses to Libby that he has an eating disorder, and shows her a stash of Dharma food. Hurley expresses interest in getting rid of it, and she encourages him to do so. Just after Hurley destroys his supplies, other survivors go into the jungle. Following them, Hurley and Libby see that an enormous package of food parachuted from the sky. After Hurley panics at the suggestion of again being in charge of the supplies, he sees Dave, and tries to follow him as he goes into the jungle. After Hurley loses Dave's trail twice, he asks Sawyer (Josh Holloway) for medicine to fight the hallucinations he believes he's been having. After mocking Hurley, Sawyer is brutally attacked by him and his tent ruined. Hurley decides to leave the beach and go to the caves. On the way, Dave reappears, and tells Hurley that everything that has happened since the night of the escape attempt has been a fantasy ‚Äî that after Dave escaped, Hurley went into a catatonic state and has imagined everything since then. As proof, Dave points out the appearances of the numbers said by another intern, Leonard (Ron Bottitta) in both Hurley's winning lottery ticket and the hatch computer number-sequence. Dave takes Hurley to a cliff, and tells him to jump and get out of his dream, before jumping off himself. Before Hurley can decide whether or not to follow Dave, Libby finds him. Hurley states to her he believes everything happening is not real, and is only a comatose dream, including her, but Libby convinces him otherwise, in part by kissing him. In the hatch, Sayid (Naveen Andrews) and Ana-Luc√≠a (Michelle Rodriguez) interrogate \\"Henry Gale\\" (Michael Emerson). After Henry's new cover-up story is proved false, Henry finally admits that he is indeed an Other, but says he would be killed if he talks. Later, Locke (Terry O'Quinn) confronts the prisoner, demanding to know if he let himself be caught, thinking it might have been to find the Swan. \\"Henry\\", however, calls the hatch a \\"joke\\", saying that during the lockdown, he never entered the numbers into the computer or pushed the button; he simply stood there, and watched the timer's numbers turn to red hieroglyphs before they reset back on their own. Locke, however, replies that Henry is lying, but he replies that he's \\"done lying\\". Production alt=A bald man wearing a white shirt and a black jacket. ABC was concerned about the content of the episode, arguing that the idea that the story could be all in Hurley's head was offering an explanation for the show as a whole, since a recurring theory among the fandom was that the events of the series were hallucinations. The character of Dave was meant to be a side of Hurley who felt he had no problem, and encourages Hurley to overeat, and is played by Evan Handler in a way director Jack Bender described as \\"mischievous, impish-like\\". Showrunner Carlton Cuse revealed his name comes from Hurley's father, David Reyes - who would later appear in the series played by Cheech Marin - because the writers \\"wanted Hurley to imagine a friend and have that be wrapped up in his unresolved relationship with his dad\\". The final scene with Libby was so secret that only Jack Bender and his assistant director had it in their scripts, and to prevent Libby from being the only woman in the mental institution, every woman on the set, including Bender's daughter Sophie, was dressed in robes and pajamas to appear as background characters. Director Bender decided to depict Dave in a way audiences would first believe him to be real, but without the character actually interacting with the physical world, similar to films such as The Sixth Sense and A Beautiful Mind. For the scene in which Dave walks through the jungle with Hurley, red and orange flowers were placed to add some \\"magic\\" to the scene, something Bender described as a \\"'Hurley in Wonderland' feel\\". The scene in which Hurley attacks Sawyer was intended to be a humorous moment, with Bender suggesting that the tent be knocked over, and Josh Holloway adding Sawyer trying to escape but being pulled back. The scene in which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are occurring in his mind suffered from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach scene to be redubbed in post-production, and rain on one day changing the location of the basketball game scene to an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff. The cliff was digitally redesigned in post-production to appear as if the actors were standing on the edge. Dave's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen, with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics. The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu, except for Dr. Brooks's office, which was done inside a studio. Reception 16.38 million American viewers tuned into this episode. Reviews were mixed. Scott Brown of Entertainment Weekly praised Jorge Garcia's and Michael Emerson's performances, and said that the episode made the island \\"feel dangerous again\\". Ryan J. Budke of TV Squad felt that the B-story in the hatch was more interesting than Hurley's scenes, and considered \\"Dave\\" depressing, in opposition to the other \\"so light-hearted\\" Hurley-centered episodes. IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7 out of 10, considering it entertaining even if it \\"doesn't really impact the series as a whole,\\" but the website later ranked \\"Dave\\" as the 9th worst Lost episode ever, describing it as meaningless and saying the flashback \\"felt pretty extraneous.\\" New York magazine listed \\"Dave\\" sixth in a \\"Twenty Most Pointless Episodes of Lost\\" list, considering that \\"using an episode to disprove a theory that wasn‚Äôt so prevalent was a waste of time.\\" On the other hand, the Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the 30th best of the series, describing it as \\"perhaps the most misunderstood episode of Lost ever,\\" saying that Dave not being real was meant to be a twist, but just \\"the biggest expression of just how messed up Hurley was before he found the island.\\" References External links *\\"Dave\\" at ABC  Category:Lost (season 2) episodes Category:2006 American television episodes ","title":"Dave (Lost)"},{"id":"4500990","text":"Bifr√∂st University is located in the valley of Nor√∞ur√°rdalur, approximately 30 kilometers north of Borgarnes, Iceland. Originally a business school, it also offers degrees in law and social sciences, at both bachelor's and master's level, as well as a remedial university preparatory course. As of 2011, the university had 573 enrolled students.‚ÄúSkr√°√∞ir nemendur √≠ framhalds- og h√°sk√≥lum hausti√∞ 2011,‚Äù Hagstofa √çslands, https://hagstofa.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?ItemID=13580 Student and staff housing surrounds the school, which with H√≥lar University College is one of two real ‚Äúcampus universities‚Äù in Iceland. However, many enrolled students are in distance learning programs. Bifr√∂st University as seen from a nearby volcano History The university was founded in Reykjav√≠k in 1918 as a secondary school called the Cooperative College (Samvinnusk√≥linn). The school was run by the Icelandic cooperative movement (Samband √≠slenskra samvinnuf√©laga) and was originally intended as a training college for the staff of cooperative stores and other members of the movement. The founder and first head of the school was J√≥nas J√≥nsson from Hrifla, who was for many years a member of Parliament for the Progressive Party. He had studied at Askov Folk High School in Denmark and Ruskin College in Oxford, and his ideas about education were innovative for the time. In 1955 the school moved to its present location in the scenic countryside of Nor√∞ur√°rdalur. Within walking distance of campus are Lake Hre√∞avatn, the waterfall Glanni, and the volcanic cones of Gr√°br√≥k and Gr√°br√≥karfell. At first, the school offered a two-year residential program in retail management for students aged roughly sixteen to eighteen. During the 1980s and the 1990s, the school slowly transformed into a university-level institution offering diploma and bachelor's programs in business. In 1998, a tunnel was opened which reduced the driving time from Reykjav√≠k to Bifr√∂st to around an hour and a half, changes in Icelandic society increased the demand for higher education, and new legislation authorized universities to charge fees. Bifr√∂st took advantage of these developments, expanded its programs and student numbers considerably, and began charging tuition to students in addition to receiving state support. In 2006, the institution's name was changed from Bifr√∂st School of Business to Bifr√∂st University. Later that year the school's rector resigned amid controversy, partly involving allegations of financial mismanagement.\\"Stj√≥rnart√≠√∞ Run√≥lfs √° Bifr√∂st,‚Äù Morgunbla√∞i√∞, 17 June 2007, page 52.

The episode was directed by Eric Laneuville, and written by Steven Maeda and Leonard Dick. It first aired on April 12, 2006, on ABC. The characters of Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell) and Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) are featured in the episode's flashbacks. Plot Flashbacks Bernard and Rose are seen meeting for the first time when he helps get her car unstuck from the snow. Rose, initially reluctant to accept his help, ultimately manages to free the car with his support. In return for his assistance, and perhaps a result of an initial attraction, she offers to buy him a cup of coffee. Bernard and Rose are lunching with a view of Niagara Falls, five months after their first meeting. At this point, Bernard proposes to Rose, citing that they \\"fell into this rhythm\\". Rose, without giving an answer, reveals she is terminally ill with cancer, and has a year left to live, perhaps slightly longer. Bernard nevertheless reaffirms his proposal, to which Rose responds with an affirmative. On their honeymoon, Bernard takes her to Australia to see a faith healer, Isaac of Uluru. Rose becomes angry and says, \\"I have made my peace with what's happening to me.\\" However, Bernard succeeds in persuading Rose to talk to Isaac, who states that his office is on top of a place of great energy, perhaps magnetic or geological. He says he will attempt to harness that energy to give it to others. However, he says he is unable to help Rose because the energy in Australia is not the right kind for her. He even offers to return Bernard's money, but Rose tells him to keep it, saying that she will tell Bernard that Isaac \\"fixed\\" her so that Bernard would stop trying to save her life. In the airport, Rose drops her pills while waiting for a boarding call. Locke, still in his wheelchair, returns them to her. On the beach Rose Henderson and Bernard Nadler are bickering over the recent arrival of DHARMA Initiative food drops. Bernard posits that the other survivors had already \\"given up\\" on being rescued. Jack approaches James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) to explain his plan for a prisoner exchange. Jack invites Kate to accompany him into the jungle, and she agrees to come. Bernard enlists Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) to gather the survivors for an impromptu meeting. Bernard admonishes the others for losing their will to be rescued. He, citing the supply plane that must have dropped the DHARMA rations, suggests to create a SOS sign. Rose shoots down the plan, dismissing it as giving the others \\"false hope\\". Bernard asks Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) and Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) to help build his S.O.S. sign, but the two men respond they are too busy building a church. Bernard, incredulous at the seemingly cavalier attitude the survivors have towards their rescue, storms off. Later, Bernard tells a diminished group a newfangled plan to bring rocks from a field for the S.O.S. Hurley and Jin express skepticism for Bernard's planning skills. Bernard encounters more apathy when he tries to enlist Sawyer's help, and reveals to Rose his group had diminished to four. Bernard and Rose argue, as Rose suggests his managing skills aren't up to par. Later, Bernard and Jin engage in an argument over the placement of the rocks. Jin is visibly fatigued from the labor, and walks away. Bernard calls out, telling him he wants to get Rose home, but Jin simply apologizes and walks away. Rose derides Bernard's plan to Locke, but Locke is more sympathetic. Locke tells her that he's \\"done with the hatch\\", but Rose is skeptical. Locke tells her that Jack diagnosed a four-week period of healing, but Rose says \\"you and I both know it's not going to take that long\\". This is in reference to the airport flashback, revealing that Rose knows Locke was in a wheelchair before the plane crash. Bernard continues to work on the S.O.S. alone. Rose brings him some supper and offers him an apology for lying about being healed by Isaac. Rose says that she was nevertheless healed because after the crash, she \\"couldn't feel\\" the illness inside of her anymore. She tells him that the island healed her, and tells him with absolute certainty that she knows who or what healed her. Bernard realizes that Rose doesn't want to be rescued from fear of regaining the illness away from the island. Upon his revelation, he tells Rose that he won't leave the island or try to continue the sign. In the hatch Meanwhile, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) attempts to remember and to draw the writing he saw on the blast doors in \\"Lockdown\\", but to no avail. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) enters the armory to change Henry Gale's (Michael Emerson) bandages and to interrogate him. Jack tells Henry that he plans to cross the line of the Others and tell them that Henry is a captive. Jack suggests Henry could be used in a trade for Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), but Henry replies \\"They'll never give you Walt\\". Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) offers to accompany Jack in his attempt to negotiate with the Others. Ana gives Jack a gun and advises him to take someone with him. Locke tries to speak to Henry through the armory door, asking him whether or not he entered the numbers into the computer. However, Henry doesn't respond, only smirking to himself. Jack and Kate trek through the jungle. Kate notices a doll on the ground, and reaches to pick it up, despite Jack's frantic cries to stop. Kate picks up the doll and both she and Jack become ensnared in a net. They determine the trap is Danielle Rousseau's (Mira Furlan) due to its lower level of sophistication, and attempt to free themselves. Kate reaches around Jack to get the gun, and they try to shoot the rope suspending them in the air. Jack succeeds. Now free, Jack and Kate continue to march through the jungle, through a heavy rain. Jack asks Kate to explain her earlier comment about the lack of sophistication in the net. Kate tells him about her expedition with Claire to the other hatch. Jack and Kate arrive at the place where his standoff with the Others occurred. He calls out into the jungle, challenging them to show themselves. He becomes increasingly animated as he calls for the Others, but receives no response. In the jungle, Kate apologizes for kissing Jack, but Jack reveals that he is not sorry about the moment. A man comes stumbling out of the jungle carrying a torch. He falls to the ground in front of the two, and is turned over, revealing him to be an unconscious Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau). Development In the initial plans for the series, Jack was going to die midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge as the leader of the survivors. Kate's backstory was that her husband went to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would remain adamant that he was alive. However the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader and creating a new backstory for Kate. They liked Kate's original backstory though, so they used it for Rose, and created Bernard as her husband.\\"Before They Were Lost\\". Lost: The Complete First Season, Buena Vista Home Entertainment.

History KKXX-FM went on the air in 1977, at 107.9 FM and was owned by Buck Owens Productions. Its transmitter is located on top of Mount Adelaide, northeast of Bakersfield. At the time Owens owned both KKXX and KUZZ located at 550 on the AM dial. Under Owens, KKXX was programmed as an Adult Contemporary/Top 40 station well into the 1980s. During that time it sat at the top of the ratings in Bakersfield. In 1988, Owens dumped the KKXX call letters and format and moved his country station KUZZ to 107.9. KUZZ was now on both AM and FM. He did this because its AM was losing listeners to the new American Country KAMM at 105.3. In May 1988 KAMM picked up the old KKXX calls and dumped country and brought back the KKXX Top 40 sound Kern County. Before KAMM there was KZAY at 105.3 in the early 1980s. Frequency changes A few years earlier, in 1982, KQXR (\\"Q94 FM\\"), which was located at 94.1 FM, went on the air. It offered the same Hot/AC format that KKXX had under Buck Owens' ownership. In the summer of 1988, Mondosphere re-tooled the station, calling it \\"The New Power 105 KKXX FM\\". It began to reflect its growing Latino listenership, by rotating more dance, R&B;, and freestyle songs into its playlist, making it one of the earliest examples of the Rhythmic CHR format. While KKXX still played the Top 40 hits each week, the playlist tended to shy away from artists like Rod Stewart and Elton John, and included acts like Salt-N-Pepa, Stevie B. and Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam. KKXX was also a long-time affiliate of the \\"Rick Dees Weekly Top 40\\". The nationally syndicated countdown show ran on Power 105, and then later on X 96.5 from 1988 until 2001. KKXX also carried \\"Casey's Top 40\\" hosted by veteran personality Casey Kasem from 1989 until 1998. Peak With its re-tooled format, KKXX remained Bakersfield's most popular non-country radio station well into the 1990s. But by 1996, music had changed. Top 40 was a radio format in decline, and the scene was ripe for a shakeup on the radio dial. During KKXX's greatest period of success, now defunct rival KQXR, and its parent company American General Media, had been undergoing many changes. \\"Q94 FM\\" had been renamed KERN-FM, and had switched to a moderately successful Oldies format. Then in 1997, AGM launched \\"Kiss 94.1\\". Its Hip Hop & R&B; format came in stark contrast to the mainstream pop music that KKXX had been playing at the time. 94.1, under the new call letters KISV, began moving up in the ratings quite rapidly. In response, Mondosphere Broadcasting once again changed the frequency of \\"Bakersfield's Hit Music Station\\". After 9 years at 105.3, KKXX moved to 96.5 FM as the new \\"X96.5\\". The smooth jazz format located at KSMJ 96.5 was moved to 98.5. The oldies at 98.5 were moved to 105.3. They dumped smooth jazz in 2000 and made 98.5 KDFO classic rock. 105.3 was replaced with KKDJ, or \\"Star 105.3\\", which began as an Oldies format and later morphed into Adult Contemporary. Fans of the old station thought it simply disappeared, which served to boost the ratings of \\"Kiss 94.1\\". Decline and Rebirth In 2000, Clear Channel Communications bought the station from Mondosphere, and relabeled it \\"96.5 KISS-FM\\". Almost immediately Clear Channel sent American General Media a cease & desist order, insisting that it stop using \\"Kiss\\" as a moniker for KISV. AGM fought back and ultimately lost, renaming its station the \\"New Hot 94.1, the Rhythm Of the Valley\\". With victory in hand, Clear Channel began re-tooling KKXX once more, to mirror the Top 40 format of KIIS- FM in Los Angeles. Despite the publicity from the \\"Kiss\\" dispute and a dial and format change, it wasn't enough to pique the public's interest in KKXX. In 2004, the calls were changed to KBKO-FM, and the format switched to country (96.5 FM has since changed formats again, and is now known as KPSL-FM). American General Media now holds the KKXX call letters, which sit at 93.1 FM, which for four years hosted the \\"Pirate Radio\\" format, which is similar to the \\"Jack-FM\\" format in other markets. On July 20, 2009, at midnight, the station abruptly dropped the Pirate Radio format and began stunting, playing nonstop construction sounds. On July 20, 2009, at 4pm, the station revealed its new format as a Top 40 (CHR) format and the station rebranded as Hot Hits 93.1 \\"Bakersfield's Hot Hit Station.\\" Airstaff The current weekday line-up on this station includes the syndicated morning show JohnJay and Rich on mornings, and Snacks, who is on mid-days.

It was written as a parody of the hymn \\"In the Sweet By-and-By\\". Copying or using the musical style of the hymn was also a way to capture the emotional resonance of that style of music and use it for a non-religious purpose. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) (commonly known as the Wobblies) concentrated much of its labor trying to organize migrant workers in lumber and construction camps. When the workers returned to the cities, the Wobblies faced the Salvation Army (which they satirized as the \\"Starvation Army\\"), and were said to have tried to drown out IWW with their religious music. Hill had first encountered the Salvation Army in Sweden when he was a child. Several songs were written parodying the Salvation Army's hymns, \\"The Preacher and the Slave\\" being the most successful. In this song, Joe Hill coined the phrase \\"pie in the sky.\\" The song is often referred to as \\"Pie in the Sky\\", or as \\"Long Haired Preachers\\" (which was its original title). It was first published in the 4th edition of the Little Red Songbook in 1911. Woody Guthrie was also known to sing this song, as well as Pete Seeger and Utah Phillips. Lyrics and chords The following lyrics are from the 19th edition of the Little Red Songbook.

Their original mission was two-fold: to discover fires and to prevent losses to insured properties. The Patrol responded primarily to fires at commercial structures, however they would respond to high loss residential fires at times. During the fire the Patrol would spread canvas salvage covers, remove water, operate elevators, and secure utilities. The New York Fire Patrol was organized under the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) labor union as Local I-26.  Operations  The Patrol's primary purpose was to reduce fire damage. During a fire, the Patrol would prevent further damage to facilities and equipment, with the goal of reducing insurance claims for the damaged goods but more importantly saving business stock and often owner's livelihoods. Over the years, they grew adept at preventing water damage by immediately pumping out excess water from fire department hoses, preventing computer and electronics damage by covering and removing equipment as soon as possible, and preventing damage from the elements by covering broken windows and doors with tarps as soon as possible. The Patrol was also credited with saving hundreds of lives from burning buildings throughout the five boroughs over the course of two hundred years. In the late 20th century the Patrol was reduced to three Patrol Houses, one each in Midtown and Downtown Manhattan and one in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, which was responsible for Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. Throughout their history, 32 patrolmen died in the line of duty, including Keith M. Roma, Badge 120, on September 11, 2001.  Discontinuance  Despite appeals to the New York Board of Fire Underwriters and the City Council, the Fire Patrol's \\"ratchets rang for the last time\\" at 0800 on October 15, 2006.

One of Gall's biggest hits, it was an unusually risqu√© song for its time, though in performing it she was unaware of the fact. Meaning \\"Les Sucettes\\" is, on the surface, a y√©-y√©-style song about a girl named Annie who likes aniseed-flavoured lollipops; much of the lyrical content plays up the homonyms of \\"Annie\\" and \\"anis\\" (aniseed). But Gainsbourg's lyric also contains playful double meanings referring to oral sex, such as a line about barley sugar running down Annie's throat. The very noun for lollypop in French, \\"sucette\\", is the substantivised verb \\"sucer\\", sucking ‚Äì so that the title and the refrain (\\"Annie aime les sucettes\\", Annie loves lollypops) are far more evocative in French than in the English translation. A possible translation to preserve the innuendo would be \\"Annie loves suckers\\". The song also features a direct double entendre, stating that Annie has lollipops \\"pour quelques pennies\\" (for a few pennies), which can also be heard as \\"pour quelques p√©nis\\" (for a few penises). Music video A film clip for the song was directed by Jean-Christophe Averty for the TV show Au risque de vous plaire. It featured props playing on the sexual references, with lollipops that were somewhat phallic rather than the traditional circle shape, interspersed with cutaways of young women suggestively sucking on lollipops. Another video was filmed, featuring Gall herself in a schoolgirl uniform inside a house, singing the song. Reaction Gall, aged 18, did not understand the double meaning of the song when she recorded it.France Gall biography at RFI Musique , accessed 25 June 2007. By Gall's account she did not realize until later why the filming of the clip attracted so many visitors to the set. She was extremely upset upon finally learning the truth about the song's double meaning ‚Äî \\"mortified, hiding herself away for weeks, refusing to face anyone\\".Sylvie Simmons, Serge Gainsbourg: A Fistful of Gitanes, , page 44. Gall said that she had sung Gainsbourg's songs \\"with an innocence of which I'm proud. I was pained to then learn that he had turned the situation to his advantage, mocking me.\\"Gilles Verlant, Gainsbourg, quoted in Sylvie Simmons, Serge Gainsbourg: A Fistful of Gitanes, , page 44. In a 2001 television interview, Gall said that she felt \\"betrayed by the adults around me.\\" Gainsbourg called the song \\"the most daring song of the century\\" in an interview with the magazine Rock and Folk. Covers * Gainsbourg recorded his own version, with a psychedelic arrangement, on the 1969 album Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg. * The song was performed by Luce as a contestant on the eighth season of the French TV singing competition Nouvelle Star in 2010. * The song was covered by the Swedish symphonic metal band Therion in the album Les Fleurs du Mal released in September 2012. Kim Kay version Another version of the song was by the Belgian Eurodance singer Kim Kay. It was released in 2000 on EMI as the fourth single and as well as the opening track from her only compilation album, Hits! (2000). It is a Eurodance song that was written by Serge Gainsbourg and produced by Phil Sterman and Lov Cook.

Like the Edsel Villager and Edsel Roundup station wagons, the Bermuda was built on a wheelbase shared with Ford's station wagons, as well as core body stampings.  Overview  The Bermuda represented the highest trim level available within the Edsel brand for a station wagon, and was only available during Edsel's introductory year of 1958. In addition to deluxe interior appointments, the Bermuda also was outfitted with simulated wood panels and frames, a hallmark of premium station wagon models produced by Ford and Mercury. The Bermuda came in six and nine-passenger configurations. To separate the Bermuda from Ford models, the Bermuda received Edsel's front fascia and vertical grille assembly as well as unique boomerang-shaped taillights. The shape of the taillights posed a problem when used as turn indicators ‚Äì the left hand taillight appeared as an arrow pointing right and vice versa from a distance. All station wagons shared the Edsel Ranger's engine availability with a V8 as standard, as was a three-speed manual transmission. Buyers also had the option of a three-speed automatic transmission with a standard column-mounted gear selector, or could choose Edsel's highly promoted but trouble-prone Teletouch automatic, which placed its drive-selection buttons in the steering wheel hub. While their roll-out was highly publicized in the fall of 1957, Edsels were a marketing disaster for Ford. Total Bermuda station wagon was 2,235 units, of which 1,456 were six-passenger models with a base price of $3,155 and 779 were nine-passenger versions priced at $3,212. This made the nine-passenger Bermuda the rarest 1958 Edsel model. For the 1959 model year, the Bermuda and Roundup station wagons were dropped (as was the trouble prone Teletouch system), leaving only the Villager as Edsel's sole station wagon model.

Featured speakers included Philip Rosedale - creator of Second Life who announced the implementation of EOS as a base for his social VR world High Fidelity, and game designer Steve Gaynor, whose games Gone Home and Tacoma Malicki-Sanchez cited as keystones for immersive storytelling and keynote speaker and Voices of VR podcast host Kent Bye whose opening presentation touched upon esoterica and the philosophical foundations of experiential design. In 2019 VRTO welcomed media harbinger Douglas Rushkoff, Bloomberg Prize Winner Amelia Winger-Bearkskin, Olivier Palmieri of Ubisoft Sarah Vicks of Intel Studios, and 35 other leaders of the VR & AR industry. The conference moved to the Toronto Media Arts Centre. Rushkoff recorded the first episode of Team Human in Canada live at the conference. Malicki-Sanchez has also been invited to speak about VR and its effect on society across North America including at Toronto Tech Week, Digital Hollywood, the Canadian National Exhibition, Cinegear Expo, ideacity, EntertainmentTO, Team Human podcast hosted by Douglas Rushkoff and New Yorker magazine, among others. In 2020 his essays were published in two books: Handbook of Research on the Global Impacts and Roles of Immersive Media Edited by Jacquelyn Ford Morie and Kate McCallum, and Dyscorpia: Future Intersections of the Body and Technology, Edited by Marilene Oliver and Daniel Laforest, Published by Dept of Art and Design, University of Alberta. The same year he moved the VRTO conference online, working with various platforms to create a multiplatform experience he coined \\"The Flotilla.\\" It used a video-streaming conference app, the Mozilla Hubs web VR platform running custom code on the Amazon Web Services cloud and hosted a microsummit on accessibility. The launch of this initiative corresponded with his creation of the company Spatialized.Events.  Filmography  * Being Perfectly Frank (2020) ‚Äì Kyle\\\\- Being Perfectly Frank 2020 * Anyone Home?

Its latter name comes from its founder, Arsaces I, who led the Parni tribe in conquering the region of Parthia\\"roughly western Khurasan\\" . in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) under Andragoras, in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I (r. c. 171‚Äì132 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to present- day Afghanistan. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han dynasty of China, became a center of trade and commerce. The Parthians largely adopted the art, architecture, religious beliefs, and royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire, which encompassed Persian, Hellenistic, and regional cultures. For about the first half of its existence, the Arsacid court adopted elements of Greek culture, though it eventually saw a gradual revival of Iranian traditions. The Arsacid rulers were titled the \\"King of Kings\\", as a claim to be the heirs to the Achaemenid Empire; indeed, they accepted many local kings as vassals where the Achaemenids would have had centrally appointed, albeit largely autonomous, satraps. The court did appoint a small number of satraps, largely outside Iran, but these satrapies were smaller and less powerful than the Achaemenid potentates. With the expansion of Arsacid power, the seat of central government shifted from Nisa to Ctesiphon along the Tigris (south of modern Baghdad, Iraq), although several other sites also served as capitals. The earliest enemies of the Parthians were the Seleucids in the west and the Scythians in the north. However, as Parthia expanded westward, they came into conflict with the Kingdom of Armenia, and eventually the late Roman Republic. Rome and Parthia competed with each other to establish the kings of Armenia as their subordinate clients. The Parthians soundly defeated Marcus Licinius Crassus at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC, and in 40‚Äì39 BC, Parthian forces captured the whole of the Levant except Tyre from the Romans. However, Mark Antony led a counterattack against Parthia, although his successes were generally achieved in his absence, under the leadership of his lieutenant Ventidius. Various Roman emperors or their appointed generals invaded Mesopotamia in the course of the ensuing Roman‚ÄìParthian Wars of the next few centuries. The Romans captured the cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon on multiple occasions during these conflicts, but were never able to hold on to them. Frequent civil wars between Parthian contenders to the throne proved more dangerous to the Empire's stability than foreign invasion, and Parthian power evaporated when Ardashir I, ruler of Istakhr in Persis, revolted against the Arsacids and killed their last ruler, Artabanus IV, in 224 AD. Ardashir established the Sasanian Empire, which ruled Iran and much of the Near East until the Muslim conquests of the 7th century AD, although the Arsacid dynasty lived on through the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia, the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia, and the Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania; all eponymous branches of the Parthian Arsacids. Native Parthian sources, written in Parthian, Greek and other languages, are scarce when compared to Sasanian and even earlier Achaemenid sources. Aside from scattered cuneiform tablets, fragmentary ostraca, rock inscriptions, drachma coins, and the chance survival of some parchment documents, much of Parthian history is only known through external sources. These include mainly Greek and Roman histories, but also Chinese histories, prompted by the Han Chinese desire to form alliances against the Xiongnu. Parthian artwork is viewed by historians as a valid source for understanding aspects of society and culture that are otherwise absent in textual sources. History Origins and establishment alt=Two sides of a silver coin. The one on the left bears the imprint of a man's head, while the one on the right a sitting individual. Before Arsaces I founded the Arsacid Dynasty, he was chieftain of the Parni, an ancient Central-Asian tribe of Iranian peoples and one of several nomadic tribes within the confederation of the Dahae.; ; ; The Parni most likely spoke an eastern Iranian language, in contrast to the northwestern Iranian language spoken at the time in Parthia.; The latter was a northeastern province, first under the Achaemenid, and then the Seleucid empires.; After conquering the region, the Parni adopted Parthian as the official court language, speaking it alongside Middle Persian, Aramaic, Greek, Babylonian, Sogdian and other languages in the multilingual territories they would conquer.; Why the Arsacid court retroactively chose 247 BC as the first year of the Arsacid era is uncertain. A.D.H. Bivar concludes that this was the year the Seleucids lost control of Parthia to Andragoras, the appointed satrap who rebelled against them. Hence, Arsaces I \\"backdated his regnal years\\" to the moment when Seleucid control over Parthia ceased. However, Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis asserts that this was simply the year Arsaces was made chief of the Parni tribe. Homa Katouzian and Gene Ralph Garthwaite claim it was the year Arsaces conquered Parthia and expelled the Seleucid authorities, yet Curtis and Maria Brosius state that Andragoras was not overthrown by the Arsacids until 238 BC. It is unclear who immediately succeeded Arsaces I. Bivar and Katouzian affirm that it was his brother Tiridates I of Parthia, who in turn was succeeded by his son Arsaces II of Parthia in 211 BC. Yet Curtis and Brosius state that Arsaces II was the immediate successor of Arsaces I, with Curtis claiming the succession took place in 211 BC, and Brosius in 217 BC. Bivar insists that 138 BC, the last regnal year of Mithridates I, is \\"the first precisely established regnal date of Parthian history.\\" Due to these and other discrepancies, Bivar outlines two distinct royal chronologies accepted by historians. A fictitious claim was later made from the 2nd-century BC onwards by the Parthians, which represented them as descendants of the Achaemenid king of kings, Artaxerxes II of Persia (). alt=A map centered on the Mediterranean and Middle East showing the extent of the Roman Republic (Purple), Selucid Empire (Blue), and Parthia (Yellow) around 200 BC. For a time, Arsaces consolidated his position in Parthia and Hyrcania by taking advantage of the invasion of Seleucid territory in the west by Ptolemy III Euergetes (r. 246‚Äì222 BC) of Egypt. This conflict with Ptolemy, the Third Syrian War (246‚Äì241 BC), also allowed Diodotus I to rebel and form the Greco- Bactrian Kingdom in Central Asia. The latter's successor, Diodotus II, formed an alliance with Arsaces against the Seleucids, but Arsaces was temporarily driven from Parthia by the forces of Seleucus II Callinicus (r. 246‚Äì225 BC). After spending some time in exile among the nomadic Apasiacae tribe, Arsaces led a counterattack and recaptured Parthia. Seleucus II's successor, Antiochus III the Great (r. 222‚Äì187 BC), was unable to immediately retaliate because his troops were engaged in putting down the rebellion of Molon in Media. Antiochus III launched a massive campaign to retake Parthia and Bactria in 210 or 209 BC. Despite some victories he was unsuccessful, but did negotiate a peace settlement with Arsaces II. The latter was granted the title of king (Greek: basileus) in return for his submission to Antiochus III as his superior.; ; The Seleucids were unable to further intervene in Parthian affairs following increasing encroachment by the Roman Republic and the Seleucid defeat at Magnesia in 190 BC. Priapatius (r. c. 191‚Äì176 BC) succeeded Arsaces II, and Phraates I (r. c. 176‚Äì171 BC) eventually ascended the throne. Phraates I ruled Parthia without further Seleucid interference.; Expansion and consolidation alt=Two sides of a coin. The side on the left showing the head of a bearded man, while the right a standing individual. Phraates I is recorded as expanding Parthia's control past the Gates of Alexander and occupied Apamea Ragiana. The locations of these are unknown. Yet the greatest expansion of Parthian power and territory took place during the reign of his brother and successor Mithridates I (r. c. 171‚Äì132 BC), whom Katouzian compares to Cyrus the Great (d. 530 BC), founder of the Achaemenid Empire. Relations between Parthia and Greco-Bactria deteriorated after the death of Diodotus II, when Mithridates' forces captured two eparchies of the latter kingdom, then under Eucratides I (r. c. 170‚Äì145 BC).; Turning his sights on the Seleucid realm, Mithridates invaded Media and occupied Ecbatana in 148 or 147 BC; the region had been destabilized by a recent Seleucid suppression of a rebellion there led by Timarchus.; ; This victory was followed by the Parthian conquest of Babylonia in Mesopotamia, where Mithridates had coins minted at Seleucia in 141 BC and held an official investiture ceremony.; ; ; ; While Mithridates retired to Hyrcania, his forces subdued the kingdoms of Elymais and Characene and occupied Susa. By this time, Parthian authority extended as far east as the Indus River.; Whereas Hecatompylos had served as the first Parthian capital, Mithridates established royal residences at Seleucia, Ecbatana, Ctesiphon and his newly founded city, Mithradatkert (Nisa, Turkmenistan), where the tombs of the Arsacid kings were built and maintained. Ecbatana became the main summertime residence for the Arsacid royalty.; Ctesiphon may not have become the official capital until the reign of Gotarzes I (r. c. 90‚Äì80 BC).; It became the site of the royal coronation ceremony and the representational city of the Arsacids, according to Brosius. The Seleucids were unable to retaliate immediately as general Diodotus Tryphon led a rebellion at the capital Antioch in 142 BC. However, by 140 BC Demetrius II Nicator was able to launch a counter-invasion against the Parthians in Mesopotamia. Despite early successes, the Seleucids were defeated and Demetrius himself was captured by Parthian forces and taken to Hyrcania. There Mithridates treated his captive with great hospitality; he even married his daughter Rhodogune of Parthia to Demetrius.; ; Antiochus VII Sidetes (r. 138‚Äì129 BC), a brother of Demetrius, assumed the Seleucid throne and married the latter's wife Cleopatra Thea. After defeating Diodotus Tryphon, Antiochus initiated a campaign in 130 BC to retake Mesopotamia, now under the rule of Phraates II (r. c. 132‚Äì127 BC). The Parthian general Indates was defeated along the Great Zab, followed by a local uprising where the Parthian governor of Babylonia was killed. Antiochus conquered Babylonia and occupied Susa, where he minted coins.; ; After advancing his army into Media, the Parthians pushed for peace, which Antiochus refused to accept unless the Arsacids relinquished all lands to him except Parthia proper, paid heavy tribute, and released Demetrius from captivity. Arsaces released Demetrius and sent him to Syria, but refused the other demands.; ; By spring 129 BC, the Medes were in open revolt against Antiochus, whose army had exhausted the resources of the countryside during winter. While attempting to put down the revolts, the main Parthian force swept into the region and killed Antiochus at the Battle of Ecbatana in 129 BC. His body was sent back to Syria in a silver coffin; his son Seleucus was made a Parthian hostage and a daughter joined Phraates' harem.; ; see also and Mithridates II (r. c. 124‚Äì91 BC). Reverse side: seated archer carrying a bow; inscription reading \\"of the King of Kings Arsaces the Renowned/Manifest Philhellene.\\" While the Parthians regained the territories lost in the west, another threat arose in the east. In 177‚Äì176 BC the nomadic confederation of the Xiongnu dislodged the nomadic Yuezhi from their homelands in what is now Gansu province in Northwest China; the Yuezhi then migrated west into Bactria and displaced the Saka (Scythian) tribes. The Saka were forced to move further west, where they invaded the Parthian Empire's northeastern borders.; ; Mithridates was thus forced to retire to Hyrcania after his conquest of Mesopotamia. Some of the Saka were enlisted in Phraates' forces against Antiochus. However, they arrived too late to engage in the conflict. When Phraates refused to pay their wages, the Saka revolted, which he tried to put down with the aid of former Seleucid soldiers, yet they too abandoned Phraates and joined sides with the Saka.; Phraates II marched against this combined force, but he was killed in battle.; ; ; The Roman historian Justin reports that his successor Artabanus I (r. c. 128‚Äì124 BC) shared a similar fate fighting nomads in the east. He claims Artabanus was killed by the Tokhari (identified as the Yuezhi), although Bivar believes Justin conflated them with the Saka. Mithridates II (r. c. 124‚Äì91 BC) later recovered the lands lost to the Saka in Sakastan.; Han-dynasty Chinese silk from Mawangdui, 2nd century BC, silk from China was perhaps the most lucrative luxury item the Parthians traded at the western end of the Silk Road. Following the Seleucid withdrawal from Mesopotamia, the Parthian governor of Babylonia, Himerus, was ordered by the Arsacid court to conquer Characene, then ruled by Hyspaosines from Charax Spasinu. When this failed, Hyspaosines invaded Babylonia in 127 BC and occupied Seleucia. Yet by 122 BC, Mithridates II forced Hyspaosines out of Babylonia and made the kings of Characene vassals under Parthian suzerainty.; ; After Mithridates extended Parthian control further west, occupying Dura-Europos in 113 BC, he became embroiled in a conflict with the Kingdom of Armenia. His forces defeated and deposed Artavasdes I of Armenia in 97 BC, taking his son Tigranes hostage, who would later become Tigranes II \\"the Great\\" of Armenia (r. c. 95‚Äì55 BC).; The Indo- Parthian Kingdom, located in modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan made an alliance with the Parthian Empire in the 1st century BC. Bivar claims that these two states considered each other political equals. After the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana visited the court of Vardanes I (r. c. 40‚Äì47 AD) in 42 AD, Vardanes provided him with the protection of a caravan as he traveled to Indo-Parthia. When Apollonius reached Indo-Parthia's capital Taxila, his caravan leader read Vardanes' official letter, perhaps written in Parthian, to an Indian official who treated Apollonius with great hospitality. Following the diplomatic venture of Zhang Qian into Central Asia during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141‚Äì87 BC), the Han Empire of China sent a delegation to Mithridates II's court in 121 BC. The Han embassy opened official trade relations with Parthia via the Silk Road yet did not achieve a desired military alliance against the confederation of the Xiongnu.; ; The Parthian Empire was enriched by taxing the Eurasian caravan trade in silk, the most highly priced luxury good imported by the Romans.; Pearls were also a highly valued import from China, while the Chinese purchased Parthian spices, perfumes, and fruits. Exotic animals were also given as gifts from the Arsacid to Han courts; in 87 AD Pacorus II of Parthia sent lions and Persian gazelles to Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75‚Äì88 AD). Besides silk, Parthian goods purchased by Roman merchants included iron from India, spices, and fine leather. Caravans traveling through the Parthian Empire brought West Asian and sometimes Roman luxury glasswares to China.; for an archaeological survey of Roman glasswares in ancient Chinese burials, see The merchants of Sogdia, speaking an Eastern Iranian language, served as the primary middlemen of this vital silk trade between Parthia and Han China. Rome and Armenia Bronze statue of a Parthian nobleman from the sanctuary at Shami in Elymais (modern- day Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province, Iran, along the Persian Gulf), now located at the National Museum of Iran. Dated 50 BC-150 AD, Parthian School. The Yuezhi Kushan Empire in northern India largely guaranteed the security of Parthia's eastern border. Thus, from the mid-1st century BC onwards, the Arsacid court focused on securing the western border, primarily against Rome. A year following Mithridates II's subjugation of Armenia, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, the Roman proconsul of Cilicia, convened with the Parthian diplomat Orobazus at the Euphrates river. The two agreed that the river would serve as the border between Parthia and Rome, although several historians have argued that Sulla only had authority to communicate these terms back to Rome.; ; Despite this agreement, in 93 or 92 BC Parthia fought a war in Syria against the tribal leader Laodice and her Seleucid ally Antiochus X Eusebes (r. 95‚Äì92? BC), killing the latter. When one of the last Seleucid monarchs, Demetrius III Eucaerus, attempted to besiege Beroea (modern Aleppo), Parthia sent military aid to the inhabitants and Demetrius was defeated. Following the rule of Mithridates II, his son Gotarzes I succeeded him.; ; He reigned during a period coined in scholarship as the \\"Parthian Dark Age,\\" due to the lack of clear information on the events of this period in the empire, except a series of, apparently overlapping, reigns. It is only with the beginning of the reign of Orodes II in , that the line of Parthian rulers can again be reliably traced. This system of split monarchy weakened Parthia, allowing Tigranes II of Armenia to annex Parthian territory in western Mesopotamia. This land would not be restored to Parthia until the reign of Sinatruces (r. c. 78‚Äì69 BC). Following the outbreak of the Third Mithridatic War, Mithridates VI of Pontus (r. 119‚Äì63 BC), an ally of Tigranes II of Armenia, requested aid from Parthia against Rome, but Sinatruces refused help. When the Roman commander Lucullus marched against the Armenian capital Tigranocerta in 69 BC, Mithridates VI and Tigranes II requested the aid of Phraates III (r. c. 71‚Äì58). Phraates did not send aid to either, and after the fall of Tigranocerta he reaffirmed with Lucullus the Euphrates as the boundary between Parthia and Rome.; Tigranes the Younger, son of Tigranes II of Armenia, failed to usurp the Armenian throne from his father. He fled to Phraates III and convinced him to march against Armenia's new capital at Artaxarta. When this siege failed, Tigranes the Younger once again fled, this time to the Roman commander Pompey. He promised Pompey that he would act as a guide through Armenia, but, when Tigranes II submitted to Rome as a client king, Tigranes the Younger was brought to Rome as a hostage. Phraates demanded Pompey return Tigranes the Younger to him, but Pompey refused. In retaliation, Phraates launched an invasion into Corduene (southeastern Turkey) where, according to two conflicting Roman accounts, the Roman consul Lucius Afranius forced the Parthians out by either military or diplomatic means.; Cassius Dio writes that Lucius Afranius reoccupied the region without confronting the Parthian army, whereas Plutarch asserts that Afranius drove him out by military means. Phraates III was assassinated by his sons Orodes II of Parthia and Mithridates IV of Parthia, after which Orodes turned on Mithridates, forcing him to flee from Media to Roman Syria.; see also Aulus Gabinius, the Roman proconsul of Syria, marched in support of Mithridates to the Euphrates, but had to turn back to aid Ptolemy XII Auletes (r. 80‚Äì58; 55‚Äì51 BC) against a rebellion in Egypt.; also, mentions this in passing. Despite losing his Roman support, Mithridates managed to conquer Babylonia, and minted coins at Seleucia until 54 BC. In that year, Orodes' general, known only as Surena after his noble family's clan name, recaptured Seleucia, and Mithridates was executed. Marcus Licinius Crassus, one of the triumvirs, who was now proconsul of Syria, invaded Parthia in 53 BC in belated support of Mithridates.; As his army marched to Carrhae (modern Harran, southeastern Turkey), Orodes II invaded Armenia, cutting off support from Rome's ally Artavasdes II of Armenia (r. 53‚Äì34 BC). Orodes persuaded Artavasdes to a marriage alliance between the crown prince Pacorus I of Parthia (d. 38 BC) and Artavasdes' sister.; ; see also and Surena, with an army entirely on horseback, rode to meet Crassus. Surena's 1,000 cataphracts (armed with lances) and 9,000 horse archers were outnumbered roughly four to one by Crassus' army, comprising seven Roman legions and auxiliaries including mounted Gauls and light infantry. Using a baggage train of about 1,000 camels, the Parthian army provided the horse archers with a constant supply of arrows. The horse archers employed the \\"Parthian shot\\" tactic: feigning retreat to draw enemy out, then turning and shooting at them when exposed. This tactic, executed with heavy composite bows on the flat plain, devastated Crassus' infantry.; ; With some 20,000 Romans dead, approximately 10,000 captured, and roughly another 10,000 escaping west, Crassus fled into the Armenian countryside.; ; ; At the head of his army, Surena approached Crassus, offering a parley, which Crassus accepted. However, he was killed when one of his junior officers, suspecting a trap, attempted to stop him from riding into Surena's camp.; Crassus' defeat at Carrhae was one of the worst military defeats of Roman history. Parthia's victory cemented its reputation as a formidable if not equal power with Rome.; With his camp followers, war captives, and precious Roman booty, Surena traveled some 700 km (430 mi) back to Seleucia where his victory was celebrated. However, fearing his ambitions even for the Arsacid throne, Orodes had Surena executed shortly thereafter. aurei bearing the portraits of Mark Antony (left) and Octavian (right), issued in 41 BC to celebrate the establishment of the Second Triumvirate by Octavian, Antony and Marcus Lepidus in 43 BC Emboldened by the victory over Crassus, the Parthians attempted to capture Roman-held territories in Western Asia. asserts that permanent occupation was the obvious goal of the Parthians, especially after the cities of Roman Syria and even the Roman garrisons submitted to the Parthians and joined their cause. Crown prince Pacorus I and his commander Osaces raided Syria as far as Antioch in 51 BC, but were repulsed by Gaius Cassius Longinus, who ambushed and killed Osaces.; The Arsacids sided with Pompey in the civil war against Julius Caesar and even sent troops to support the anti-Caesarian forces at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC.; Quintus Labienus, a general loyal to Cassius and Brutus, sided with Parthia against the Second Triumvirate in 40 BC; the following year he invaded Syria alongside Pacorus I.; ; The triumvir Mark Antony was unable to lead the Roman defense against Parthia due to his departure to Italy, where he amassed his forces to confront his rival Octavian and eventually conducted negotiations with him at Brundisium. After Syria was occupied by Pacorus' army, Labienus split from the main Parthian force to invade Anatolia while Pacorus and his commander Barzapharnes invaded the Roman Levant. They subdued all settlements along the Mediterranean coast as far south as Ptolemais (modern Acre, Israel), with the lone exception of Tyre. In Judea, the pro-Roman Jewish forces of high priest Hyrcanus II, Phasael, and Herod were defeated by the Parthians and their Jewish ally Antigonus II Mattathias (r. 40‚Äì37 BC); the latter was made king of Judea while Herod fled to his fort at Masada. Despite these successes, the Parthians were soon driven out of the Levant by a Roman counteroffensive. Publius Ventidius Bassus, an officer under Mark Antony, defeated and then executed Labienus at the Battle of the Cilician Gates (in modern Mersin Province, Turkey) in 39 BC.; ; ; Shortly afterward, a Parthian force in Syria led by general Pharnapates was defeated by Ventidius at the Battle of Amanus Pass. As a result, Pacorus I temporarily withdrew from Syria. When he returned in the spring of 38 BC, he faced Ventidius at the Battle of Mount Gindarus, northeast of Antioch. Pacorus was killed during the battle, and his forces retreated across the Euphrates. His death spurred a succession crisis in which Orodes II chose Phraates IV (r. c. 38‚Äì2 BC) as his new heir.; ; ; see also Drachma of Phraates IV (r. c. 38‚Äì2 BC).

One of them, Monaeses, fled to Antony and convinced him to invade Parthia.; Antony defeated Parthia's Judaean ally Antigonus in 37 BC, installing Herod as a client king in his place. The following year, when Antony marched to Theodosiopolis, Artavasdes II of Armenia once again switched alliances by sending Antony additional troops. Antony invaded Media Atropatene (modern Iranian Azerbaijan), then ruled by Parthia's ally Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, with the intention of seizing the capital Praaspa, the location of which is now unknown. However, Phraates IV ambushed Antony's rear detachment, destroying a giant battering ram meant for the siege of Praaspa; after this, Artavasdes II abandoned Antony's forces. The Parthians pursued and harassed Antony's army as it fled to Armenia. Eventually, the greatly weakened force reached Syria.; ; ; see also for analysis on Rome's shift of attention away from Syria to the Upper Euphrates, starting with Antony. Antony lured Artavasdes II into a trap with the promise of a marriage alliance. He was taken captive in 34 BC, paraded in Antony's mock Roman triumph in Alexandria, Egypt, and eventually executed by Cleopatra VII of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Antony attempted to strike an alliance with Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, whose relations with Phraates IV had recently soured. This was abandoned when Antony and his forces withdrew from Armenia in 33 BC; they escaped a Parthian invasion while Antony's rival Octavian attacked his forces to the west. After the defeat and suicides of Antony and Cleopatra in 30 BC, Parthian ally Artaxias II reassumed the throne of Armenia. Peace with Rome, court intrigue and contact with Chinese generals Following the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra of Ptolemaic Egypt at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Octavian consolidated his political power and in 27 BC was named Augustus by the Roman Senate, becoming the first Roman emperor.; Around this time, Tiridates II of Parthia briefly overthrew Phraates IV, who was able to quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of Scythian nomads. Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20 BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53 BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war.; see also The Parthians viewed this exchange as a small price to pay to regain the prince. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the building of a new temple to house the standards, and even in fine art such as the breastplate scene on his statue Augustus of Prima Porta.; ; A close-up view of the breastplate on the statue of Augustus of Prima Porta, showing a Parthian man returning to Augustus the legionary standards lost by Marcus Licinius Crassus at Carrhae Along with the prince, Augustus also gave Phraates IV an Italian slave-girl, who later became Queen Musa of Parthia. To ensure that her child Phraataces would inherit the throne without incident, Musa convinced Phraates IV to give his other sons to Augustus as hostages. Again, Augustus used this as propaganda depicting the submission of Parthia to Rome, listing it as a great accomplishment in his Res Gestae Divi Augusti.; When Phraataces took the throne as Phraates V (r. c. 2 BC ‚Äì 4 AD), Musa married ruled alongside him. The Parthian nobility, disapproving of the notion of a king with non-Arsacid blood, forced the pair into exile in Roman territory.; ; see also Phraates' successor Orodes III of Parthia lasted just two years on the throne, and was followed by Vonones I, who had adopted many Roman mannerisms during time in Rome. The Parthian nobility, angered by Vonones' sympathies for the Romans, backed a rival claimant, Artabanus II of Parthia (r. c. 10‚Äì38 AD), who eventually defeated Vonones and drove him into exile in Roman Syria.; During the reign of Artabanus II, two Jewish commoners and brothers, Anilai and Asinai from Nehardea (near modern Fallujah, Iraq), led a revolt against the Parthian governor of Babylonia. After defeating the latter, the two were granted the right to govern the region by Artabanus II, who feared further rebellion elsewhere. Anilai's Parthian wife poisoned Asinai out of fear he would attack Anilai over his marriage to a gentile. Following this, Anilai became embroiled in an armed conflict with a son-in-law of Artabanus, who eventually defeated him. With the Jewish regime removed, the native Babylonians began to harass the local Jewish community, forcing them to emigrate to Seleucia. When that city rebelled against Parthian rule in 35‚Äì36 AD, the Jews were expelled again, this time by the local Greeks and Aramaeans. The exiled Jews fled to Ctesiphon, Nehardea, and Nisibis.

Although at peace with Parthia, Rome still interfered in its affairs. The Roman emperor Tiberius (r. 14‚Äì37 AD) became involved in a plot by Pharasmanes I of Iberia to place his brother Mithridates on the throne of Armenia by assassinating the Parthian ally King Arsaces of Armenia. Artabanus II tried and failed to restore Parthian control of Armenia, prompting an aristocratic revolt that forced him to flee to Scythia. The Romans released a hostage prince, Tiridates III of Parthia, to rule the region as an ally of Rome. Shortly before his death, Artabanus managed to force Tiridates from the throne using troops from Hyrcania. After Artabanus' death in 38 AD, a long civil war ensued between the rightful successor Vardanes I and his brother Gotarzes II. After Vardanes was assassinated during a hunting expedition, the Parthian nobility appealed to Roman emperor Claudius (r. 41‚Äì54 AD) in 49 AD to release the hostage prince Meherdates to challenge Gotarzes. This backfired when Meherdates was betrayed by the governor of Edessa and Izates bar Monobaz of Adiabene; he was captured and sent to Gotarzes, where he was allowed to live after having his ears mutilated, an act that disqualified him from inheriting the throne. In 97 AD, the Chinese general Ban Chao, the Protector-General of the Western Regions, sent his emissary Gan Ying on a diplomatic mission to reach the Roman Empire. Gan visited the court of Pacorus II at Hecatompylos before departing towards Rome. He traveled as far west as the Persian Gulf, where Parthian authorities convinced him that an arduous sea voyage around the Arabian Peninsula was the only means to reach Rome.; ; ; see also Discouraged by this, Gan Ying returned to the Han court and provided Emperor He of Han (r. 88‚Äì105 AD) with a detailed report on the Roman Empire based on oral accounts of his Parthian hosts.; William Watson speculates that the Parthians would have been relieved at the failed efforts by the Han Empire to open diplomatic relations with Rome, especially after Ban Chao's military victories against the Xiongnu in eastern Central Asia. However, Chinese records maintain that a Roman embassy, perhaps only a group of Roman merchants, arrived at the Han capital Luoyang by way of Jiaozhi (northern Vietnam) in 166 AD, during the reigns of Marcus Aurelius (r. 161‚Äì180 AD) and Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146‚Äì168 AD).; Although it could be coincidental, Antonine Roman golden medallions dated to the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and his predecessor Antoninus Pius have been discovered at Oc Eo, Vietnam (among other Roman artefacts in the Mekong Delta), a site that is one of the suggested locations for the port city of \\"Cattigara\\" along the Magnus Sinus (i.e. Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea) in Ptolemy's Geography.; ; Continuation of Roman hostilities and Parthian decline Map of the troop movements during the first two years of the Roman‚ÄìParthian War of 58‚Äì63 AD over the Kingdom of Armenia, detailing the Roman offensive into Armenia and capture of the country by Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo Parthian king making an offering to god Herakles-Verethragna.

After the Iberian king Pharasmanes I had his son Rhadamistus (r. 51‚Äì55 AD) invade Armenia to depose the Roman client king Mithridates, Vologases I of Parthia (r. c. 51‚Äì77 AD) planned to invade and place his brother, the later Tiridates I of Armenia, on the throne. Rhadamistus was eventually driven from power, and, beginning with the reign of Tiridates, Parthia would retain firm control over Armenia‚Äîwith brief interruptions‚Äîthrough the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia.; Even after the fall of the Parthian Empire, the Arsacid line lived on through the Armenian kings.; However, not only did the Arsacid line continue through the Armenians, it as well continued through the Georgian kings with the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia, and for many centuries afterwards in Caucasian Albania through the Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania. When Vardanes II of Parthia rebelled against his father Vologases I in 55 AD, Vologases withdrew his forces from Armenia. Rome quickly attempted to fill the political vacuum left behind. In the Roman‚ÄìParthian War of 58‚Äì63 AD, the commander Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo achieved some military successes against the Parthians while installing Tigranes VI of Armenia as a Roman client. However, Corbulo's successor Lucius Caesennius Paetus was soundly defeated by Parthian forces and fled Armenia. Following a peace treaty, Tiridates I traveled to Naples and Rome in 63 AD. At both sites the Roman emperor Nero (r. 54‚Äì68 AD) ceremoniously crowned him king of Armenia by placing the royal diadem on his head.; A long period of peace between Parthia and Rome ensued, with only the invasion of Alans into Parthia's eastern territories around 72 AD mentioned by Roman historians. Whereas Augustus and Nero had chosen a cautious military policy when confronting Parthia, later Roman emperors invaded and attempted to conquer the eastern Fertile Crescent, the heart of the Parthian Empire along the Tigris and Euphrates. The heightened aggression can be explained in part by Rome's military reforms. To match Parthia's strength in missile troops and mounted warriors, the Romans at first used foreign allies (especially Nabataeans), but later established a permanent auxilia force to complement their heavy legionary infantry. The Romans eventually maintained regiments of horse archers (sagittarii) and even mail-armored cataphracts in their eastern provinces.; see also Yet the Romans had no discernible grand strategy in dealing with Parthia and gained very little territory from these invasions. The primary motivations for war were the advancement of the personal glory and political position of the emperor, as well as defending Roman honor against perceived slights such as Parthian interference in the affairs of Rome's client states. Rock relief of Parthian king at Behistun, most likely Vologases III (r. c. 110‚Äì147 AD) Hostilities between Rome and Parthia were renewed when Osroes I of Parthia (r. c. 109‚Äì128 AD) deposed the Armenian king Sanatruk and replaced him with Axidares, son of Pacorus II, without consulting Rome. The Roman emperor Trajan (r. 98‚Äì117 AD) had the next Parthian nominee for the throne, Parthamasiris, killed in 114 AD, instead making Armenia a Roman province.; ; His forces, led by Lusius Quietus, also captured Nisibis; its occupation was essential to securing all the major routes across the northern Mesopotamian plain.; see also The following year, Trajan invaded Mesopotamia and met little resistance from only Meharaspes of Adiabene, since Osroes was engaged in a civil war to the east with Vologases III of Parthia. Trajan spent the winter of 115‚Äì116 at Antioch, but resumed his campaign in the spring. Marching down the Euphrates, he captured Dura-Europos, the capital Ctesiphon and Seleucia, and even subjugated Characene, where he watched ships depart to India from the Persian Gulf.; ; ; see also In the last months of 116 AD, Trajan captured the Persian city of Susa. When Sanatruces II of Parthia gathered forces in eastern Parthia to challenge the Romans, his cousin Parthamaspates of Parthia betrayed and killed him: Trajan crowned him the new king of Parthia. Never again would the Roman Empire advance so far to the east. On Trajan's return north, the Babylonian settlements revolted against the Roman garrisons.; Trajan was forced to retreat from Mesopotamia in 117 AD, overseeing a failed siege of Hatra during his withdrawal.; ; His retreat was‚Äîin his intentions‚Äîtemporary, because he wanted to renew the attack on Parthia in 118 AD and \\"make the subjection of the Parthians a reality,\\" but Trajan died suddenly in August 117 AD. During his campaign, Trajan was granted the title Parthicus by the Senate and coins were minted proclaiming the conquest of Parthia.; see also and However, only the 4th-century AD historians Eutropius and Festus allege that he attempted to establish a Roman province in lower Mesopotamia. A Parthian (right) wearing a Phrygian cap, depicted as a prisoner of war in chains held by a Roman (left); Arch of Septimius Severus, Rome, 203 AD Trajan's successor Hadrian (r. 117‚Äì138 AD) reaffirmed the Roman-Parthian border at the Euphrates, choosing not to invade Mesopotamia due to Rome's now limited military resources.; see also ; ; and Parthamaspates fled after the Parthians revolted against him, yet the Romans made him king of Osroene. Osroes I died during his conflict with Vologases III, the latter succeeded by Vologases IV of Parthia (r. c. 147‚Äì191 AD) who ushered in a period of peace and stability. However, the Roman‚ÄìParthian War of 161‚Äì166 AD began when Vologases invaded Armenia and Syria, retaking Edessa. Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161‚Äì180 AD) had co-ruler Lucius Verus (r. 161‚Äì169 AD) guard Syria while Marcus Statius Priscus invaded Armenia in 163 AD, followed by the invasion of Mesopotamia by Avidius Cassius in 164 AD. The Romans captured and burnt Seleucia and Ctesiphon to the ground, yet they were forced to retreat once the Roman soldiers contracted a deadly disease (possibly smallpox) that soon ravaged the Roman world.; Although they withdrew, from this point forward the city of Dura-Europos remained in Roman hands.; When Roman emperor Septimius Severus (r. 193‚Äì211 AD) invaded Mesopotamia in 197 AD during the reign of Vologases V of Parthia (r. c. 191‚Äì208 AD), the Romans once again marched down the Euphrates and captured Seleucia and Ctesiphon. After assuming the title Parthicus Maximus, he retreated in late 198 AD, failing as Trajan once did to capture Hatra during a siege.; ; ; Around 212 AD, soon after Vologases VI of Parthia (r. c. 208‚Äì222 AD) took the throne, his brother Artabanus IV of Parthia (d. 224 AD) rebelled against him and gained control over a greater part of the empire. Meanwhile, the Roman emperor Caracalla (r. 211‚Äì217 AD) deposed the kings of Osroene and Armenia to make them Roman provinces once more. He marched into Mesopotamia under the pretext of marrying one of Artabanus' daughters, but‚Äîbecause the marriage was not allowed‚Äîmade war on Parthia and conquered Arbil east of the Tigris river. Caracalla was assassinated the next year on the road to Carrhae by his soldiers. After this debacle, the Parthians made a settlement with Macrinus (r. 217‚Äì218) where the Romans paid Parthia over two-hundred million denarii with additional gifts.; see also , who mentions this in passing The Parthian Empire, weakened by internal strife and wars with Rome, was soon to be followed by the Sasanian Empire. Indeed, shortly afterward, Ardashir I, the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern Fars Province, Iran) from Istakhr began subjugating the surrounding territories in defiance of Arsacid rule.; ; ; see also He confronted Artabanus IV at the Battle of HormozdgƒÅn on 28 April 224 AD, perhaps at a site near Isfahan, defeating him and establishing the Sasanian Empire. There is evidence, however, that suggests Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228 AD. The Sassanians would not only assume Parthia's legacy as Rome's Persian nemesis, but they would also attempt to restore the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by briefly conquering the Levant, Anatolia, and Egypt from the Eastern Roman Empire during the reign of Khosrau II (r. 590‚Äì628 AD). However, they would lose these territories to Heraclius‚Äîthe last Roman emperor before the Arab conquests. Nevertheless, for a period of more than 400 years, they succeeded the Parthian realm as Rome's principal rival.Norman A. Stillman The Jews of Arab Lands pp 22 Jewish Publication Society, 1979 International Congress of Byzantine Studies Proceedings of the 21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies, London, 21‚Äì26 August 2006, Volumes 1‚Äì3 pp 29. Ashgate Pub Co, 30 sep. 2006 Native and external sources Local and foreign written accounts, as well as non-textual artifacts, have been used to reconstruct Parthian history. Although the Parthian court maintained records, the Parthians had no formal study of history; the earliest universal history of Iran, the Khwaday-Namag, was not compiled until the reign of the last Sasanian ruler Yazdegerd III (r. 632‚Äì651 AD). Indigenous sources on Parthian history remain scarce, with fewer of them available than for any other period of Iranian history. Most contemporary written records on Parthia contain Greek as well as Parthian and Aramaic inscriptions. The Parthian language was written in a distinct script derived from the Imperial Aramaic chancellery script of the Achaemenids, and later developed into the Pahlavi writing system. A Sarmatian-Parthian gold necklace and amulet, 2nd century AD. Located in Tamoikin Art Fund The most valuable indigenous sources for reconstructing an accurate chronology of Arsacid rulers are the metal drachma coins issued by each ruler.; ; These represent a \\"transition from non-textual to textual remains,\\" according to historian Geo Widengren. Other Parthian sources used for reconstructing chronology include cuneiform astronomical tablets and colophons discovered in Babylonia. Indigenous textual sources also include stone inscriptions, parchment and papyri documents, and pottery ostraca. For example, at the early Parthian capital of Mithradatkert/Nisa in Turkmenistan, large caches of pottery ostraca have been found yielding information on the sale and storage of items like wine.; ; Along with parchment documents found at sites like Dura-Europos, these also provide valuable information on Parthian governmental administration, covering issues such as taxation, military titles, and provincial organization.; Parthian golden necklace, 2nd century AD, Iran, Reza Abbasi Museum A Parthian ceramic oil lamp, Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province, Iran, National Museum of Iran The Greek and Latin histories, which represent the majority of materials covering Parthian history, are not considered entirely reliable since they were written from the perspective of rivals and wartime enemies.; These external sources generally concern major military and political events, and often ignore social and cultural aspects of Parthian history.; The Romans usually depicted the Parthians as fierce warriors but also as a culturally refined people; recipes for Parthian dishes in the cookbook Apicius exemplifies their admiration for Parthian cuisine.; see also for further analysis: \\"Curiously, at the same time as the Parthian was depicted as uncivilised, he was also 'orientalised' in traditional fashion, being described as luxury-loving, leading an effeminate lifestyle, and demonstrating excessive sexuality.\\" Apollodorus of Artemita and Arrian wrote histories focusing on Parthia, which are now lost and survive only as quoted extracts in other histories. Isidore of Charax, who lived during the reign of Augustus, provides an account of Parthian territories, perhaps from a Parthian government survey. To a lesser extent, people and events of Parthian history were also included in the histories of Justin, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, Cassius Dio, Appian, Josephus, Pliny the Elder, and Herodian. Parthian history can also be reconstructed via the Chinese historical records of events. In contrast to Greek and Roman histories, the early Chinese histories maintained a more neutral view when describing Parthia,; although the habit of Chinese chroniclers to copy material for their accounts from older works (of undetermined origin) makes it difficult to establish a chronological order of events. The Chinese called Parthia ƒÄnxƒ´ (Chinese: ÂÆâ ÊÅØ, Old Chinese pronunciation: 'ansj…ôk), perhaps after the Greek name for the Parthian city Antiochia in Margiana (Greek: ·ºàŒΩœÑŒπœåœáŒµŒπŒ± ·º° ·ºêŒΩ œÑ·øá ŒúŒ±œÅŒ≥ŒπŒ±ŒΩ·øá). However, this could also have been a transliteration of \\"Arsaces\\", after the dynasty's eponymous founder. The works and historical authors include the Shiji (also known as the Records of the Grand Historian) by Sima Qian, the Han shu (Book of Han) by Ban Biao, Ban Gu, and Ban Zhao, and the Hou Han shu (Book of Later Han) by Fan Ye. They provide information on the nomadic migrations leading up to the early Saka invasion of Parthia and valuable political and geographical information. For example, the Shiji (ch. 123) describes diplomatic exchanges, exotic gifts given by Mithridates II to the Han court, types of agricultural crops grown in Parthia, production of wine using grapes, itinerant merchants, and the size and location of Parthian territory.; The Shiji also mentions that the Parthians kept records by \\"writing horizontally on strips of leather,\\" that is, parchment.; see also for a similar translation Government and administration Central authority and semi-autonomous kings Coin of Kamnaskires III, king of Elymais (modern Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province), and his wife Queen Anzaze, 1st century BC Compared with the earlier Achaemenid Empire, the Parthian government was notably decentralized. An indigenous historical source reveals that territories overseen by the central government were organized in a similar manner to the Seleucid Empire. They both had a threefold division for their provincial hierarchies: the Parthian marzbƒÅn, x≈°atrap, and dizpat, similar to the Seleucid satrapy, eparchy, and hyparchy. The Parthian Empire also contained several subordinate semi-autonomous kingdoms, including the states of Caucasian Iberia, Armenia, Atropatene, Gordyene, Adiabene, Edessa, Hatra, Mesene, Elymais, and Persis. The state rulers governed their own territories and minted their own coinage distinct from the royal coinage produced at the imperial mints.; This was not unlike the earlier Achaemenid Empire, which also had some city-states, and even distant satrapies who were semi-independent but \\"recognised the supremacy of the king, paid tribute and provided military support\\", according to Brosius. However, the satraps of Parthian times governed smaller territories, and perhaps had less prestige and influence than their Achaemenid predecessors. During the Seleucid period, the trend of local ruling dynasties with semi- autonomous rule, and sometimes outright rebellious rule, became commonplace, a fact reflected in the later Parthian style of governance. Nobility A statue of a young Palmyran in fine Parthian trousers, from a funerary stele at Palmyra, early 3rd century AD The King of Kings headed the Parthian government. He maintained polygamous relations, and was usually succeeded by his first-born son. Like the Ptolemies of Egypt, there is also record of Arsacid kings marrying their nieces and perhaps even half-sisters; Queen Musa married her own son, though this was an extreme and isolated case. Brosius provides an extract from a letter written in Greek by King Artabanus II in 21 AD, which addresses the governor (titled \\"archon\\") and citizens of the city of Susa. Specific government offices of Preferred Friend, Bodyguard and Treasurer are mentioned and the document also proves that \\"while there were local jurisdictions and proceedings to appointment to high office, the king could intervene on behalf of an individual, review a case and amend the local ruling if he considered it appropriate.\\" The hereditary titles of the hierarchic nobility recorded during the reign of the first Sasanian monarch Ardashir I most likely reflect the titles already in use during the Parthian era. There were three distinct tiers of nobility, the highest being the regional kings directly below the King of Kings, the second being those related to the King of Kings only through marriage, and the lowest order being heads of local clans and small territories. By the 1st century AD, the Parthian nobility had assumed great power and influence in the succession and deposition of Arsacid kings. Some of the nobility functioned as court advisers to the king, as well as holy priests. Strabo, in his Geographica, preserved a claim by the Greek philosopher and historian Poseidonius that the Council of Parthia consisted of noble kinsmen and magi, two groups from which \\"the kings were appointed.\\" Of the great noble Parthian families listed at the beginning of the Sassanian period, only two are explicitly mentioned in earlier Parthian documents: the House of Suren and the House of Karen. The historian Plutarch noted that members of the Suren family, the first among the nobility, were given the privilege of crowning each new Arsacid King of Kings during their coronations.; Military The Parthian Empire had no standing army, yet were able to quickly recruit troops in the event of local crises.; There was a permanent armed guard attached to the person of the king, comprising nobles, serfs and mercenaries, but this royal retinue was small. Garrisons were also permanently maintained at border forts; Parthian inscriptions reveal some of the military titles granted to the commanders of these locations. Military forces could also be used in diplomatic gestures. For example, when Chinese envoys visited Parthia in the late 2nd century BC, the Shiji maintains that 20,000 horsemen were sent to the eastern borders to serve as escorts for the embassy, although this figure is perhaps an exaggeration. The main striking force of the Parthian army was its cataphracts, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in mailed armor.; The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines, but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted to horse archers.; Due to the cost of their equipment and armor, cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who, in return for their services, demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings.; see also and The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as horse archers; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle. They used composite bows and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them; this technique, known as the Parthian shot, was a highly effective tactic.; ; The heavy and light cavalry of Parthia proved to be a decisive factor in the Battle of Carrhae where a Parthian force defeated a much larger Roman army under Crassus. Light infantry units, composed of levied commoners and mercenaries, were used to disperse enemy troops after cavalry charges. The size of the Parthian army is unknown, as is the size of the empire's overall population. However, archaeological excavations in former Parthian urban centers reveal settlements which could have sustained large populations and hence a great resource in manpower. Dense population centers in regions like Babylonia were no doubt attractive to the Romans, whose armies could afford to live off the land. Currency Usually made of silver, the Greek drachma coin, including the tetradrachm, was the standard currency used throughout the Parthian Empire.; The Arsacids maintained royal mints at the cities of Hecatompylos, Seleucia, and Ecbatana. They most likely operated a mint at Mithridatkert/Nisa as well. From the empire's inception until its collapse, drachmas produced throughout the Parthian period rarely weighed less than 3.5 g or more than 4.2 g. The first Parthian tetradrachms, weighing in principle around 16 g with some variation, appear after Mithridates I conquered Mesopotamia and were minted exclusively at Seleucia. Society and culture Hellenism and the Iranian revival Coin of Mithridates II of Parthia. The clothing is Parthian, while the style is Hellenistic (sitting on an omphalos). The Greek inscription reads \\"King Arsaces, the philhellene\\" Although Greek culture of the Seleucids was widely adopted by peoples of the Near East during the Hellenistic period, the Parthian era witnessed an Iranian cultural revival in religion, the arts, and even clothing fashions.; see also Conscious of both the Hellenistic and Persian cultural roots of their kingship, the Arsacid rulers styled themselves after the Persian King of Kings and affirmed that they were also philhellenes (\\"friends of the Greeks\\").; The word \\"philhellene\\" was inscribed on Parthian coins until the reign of Artabanus II. The discontinuation of this phrase signified the revival of Iranian culture in Parthia. Vologases I was the first Arsacid ruler to have the Parthian script and language appear on his minted coins alongside the now almost illegible Greek.; see also and However, the use of Greek-alphabet legends on Parthian coins remained until the collapse of the empire. A ceramic Parthian water spout in the shape of a man's head, dated 1st or 2nd century AD Greek cultural influence did not disappear from the Parthian Empire, however, and there is evidence that the Arsacids enjoyed Greek theatre. When the head of Crassus was brought to Orodes II, he, alongside Armenian king Artavasdes II, were busy watching a performance of The Bacchae by the playwright Euripides (c. 480‚Äì406 BC). The producer of the play decided to use Crassus' actual severed head in place of the stage-prop head of Pentheus. On his coins, Arsaces I is depicted in apparel similar to Achaemenid satraps. According to A. Shahbazi, Arsaces \\"deliberately diverges from Seleucid coins to emphasize his nationalistic and royal aspirations, and he calls himself KƒÅrny/Karny (Greek: Autocrator), a title already borne by Achaemenid supreme generals, such as Cyrus the Younger.\\" In line with Achaemenid traditions, rock-relief images of Arsacid rulers were carved at Mount Behistun, where Darius I of Persia (r. 522‚Äì486 BC) made royal inscriptions.; Moreover, the Arsacids claimed familial descent from Artaxerxes II of Persia (r. 404‚Äì358 BC) as a means to bolster their legitimacy in ruling over former Achaemenid territories, i.e. as being \\"legitimate successors of glorious kings\\" of ancient Iran. Artabanus II named one of his sons Darius and laid claim to Cyrus' heritage. The Arsacid kings chose typical Zoroastrian names for themselves and some from the \\"heroic background\\" of the Avesta, according to V.G. Lukonin.; The Parthians also adopted the use of the Babylonian calendar with names from the Achaemenid Iranian calendar, replacing the Macedonian calendar of the Seleucids. Religion Parthian votive relief from Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province, Iran, 2nd century AD The Parthian Empire, being culturally and politically heterogeneous, had a variety of religious systems and beliefs, the most widespread being those dedicated to Greek and Iranian cults. Aside from a minority of Jews and early Christians, most Parthians were polytheistic. Greek and Iranian deities were often blended together as one. For example, Zeus was often equated with Ahura Mazda, Hades with Angra Mainyu, Aphrodite and Hera with Anahita, Apollo with Mithra, and Hermes with Shamash.; ; Aside from the main gods and goddesses, each ethnic group and city had their own designated deities. As with Seleucid rulers, Parthian art indicates that the Arsacid kings viewed themselves as gods; this cult of the ruler was perhaps the most widespread. The extent of Arsacid patronage of Zoroastrianism is debated in modern scholarship.; The followers of Zoroaster would have found the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable. However, there is evidence that Vologases I encouraged the presence of Zoroastrian magi priests at court and sponsored the compilation of sacred Zoroastrian texts which later formed the Avesta.; ; The Sasanian court would later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire.; Although Mani (216‚Äì276 AD), the founding prophet of Manichaeism, did not proclaim his first religious revelation until 228/229 AD, Bivar asserts that his new faith contained \\"elements of Mandaean belief, Iranian cosmogony, and even echoes of Christianity ... [it] may be regarded as a typical reflection of the mixed religious doctrines of the late Arsacid period, which the Zoroastrian orthodoxy of the Sasanians was soon to sweep away.\\" There is scant archaeological evidence for the spread of Buddhism from the Kushan Empire into Iran proper. However, it is known from Chinese sources that An Shigao (fl. 2nd century AD), a Parthian nobleman and Buddhist monk, traveled to Luoyang in Han China as a Buddhist missionary and translated several Buddhist canons into Chinese.; Art and architecture A barrel vaulted iwan at the entrance at the ancient site of Hatra, modern-day Iraq, built c. 50 AD The Parthian Temple of Charyios in Uruk. Parthian art can be divided into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the Iranian plateau; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia. The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, combined elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in Achaemenid art, as exemplified by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia. Common motifs of the Parthian period include scenes of royal hunting expeditions and the investiture of Arsacid kings.; see also Use of these motifs extended to include portrayals of local rulers. Common art mediums were rock-reliefs, frescos, and even graffiti. Geometric and stylized plant patterns were also used on stucco and plaster walls. The common motif of the Sasanian period showing two horsemen engaged in combat with lances first appeared in the Parthian reliefs at Mount Behistun. In portraiture the Parthians favored and emphasized frontality, meaning the person depicted by painting, sculpture, or raised-relief on coins faced the viewer directly instead of showing his or her profile.; ; Although frontality in portraiture was already an old artistic technique by the Parthian period, Daniel Schlumberger explains the innovation of Parthian frontality: > 'Parthian frontality', as we are now accustomed to call it, deeply differs > both from ancient Near Eastern and from Greek frontality, though it is, no > doubt, an offspring of the latter. For both in Oriental art and in Greek > art, frontality was an exceptional treatment: in Oriental art it was a > treatment strictly reserved for a small number of traditional characters of > cult and myth; in Greek art it was an option resorted to only for definite > reasons, when demanded by the subject, and, on the whole, seldom made use > of. With Parthian art, on the contrary, frontality becomes the normal > treatment of the figure. For the Parthians frontality is really nothing but > the habit of showing, in relief and in painting, all figures full-face, even > at the expense (as it seems to us moderns) of clearness and intelligibility. > So systematic is this use that it amounts to a complete banishment de facto > of the side-view and of all intermediate attitudes. This singular state of > things seems to have become established in the course of the 1st century > A.D. A wall mural depicting a scene from the Book of Esther at the Dura-Europos synagogue, dated 245 AD, which Curtis and Schlumberger describe as a fine example of 'Parthian frontality' Parthian art, with its distinct use of frontality in portraiture, was lost and abandoned with the profound cultural and political changes brought by the Sasanian Empire. However, even after the Roman occupation of Dura-Europos in 165 AD, the use of Parthian frontality in portraiture continued to flourish there. This is exemplified by the early 3rd- century AD wall murals of the Dura-Europos synagogue, a temple in the same city dedicated to Palmyrene gods, and the local Mithraeum.; Parthian architecture adopted elements of Achaemenid and Greek architecture, but remained distinct from the two. The style is first attested at Mithridatkert/Nisa. The Round Hall of Nisa is similar to Hellenistic palaces, but different in that it forms a circle and vault inside a square space. However, the artwork of Nisa, including marble statues and the carved scenes on ivory rhyton vessels, is unquestionably influenced by Greek art.; A signature feature of Parthian architecture was the iwan, an audience hall supported by arches or barrel vaults and open on one side.; ; Use of the barrel vault replaced the Hellenic use of columns to support roofs. Although the iwan was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, it was the Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale. The earliest Parthian iwans are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD. Monumental iwans are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style. The largest Parthian iwans at that site have a span of 15 m (50 ft). Clothing and apparel Hellenistic-style helmet, from the Parthian royal residence and necropolis of Nisa, Turkmenistan, 2nd century BC The typical Parthian riding outfit is exemplified by the famous bronze statue of a Parthian nobleman found at Shami, Elymais. Standing 1.9 m (6 ft), the figure wears a V-shaped jacket, a V-shaped tunic fastened in place with a belt, loose-fitting and many-folded trousers held by garters, and a diadem or band over his coiffed, bobbed hair. His outfit is commonly seen in relief images of Parthian coins by the mid-1st century BC. Examples of clothing in Parthian inspired sculptures have been found in excavations at Hatra, in northwestern Iraq. Statues erected there feature the typical Parthian shirt (qamis), combined with trousers and made with fine, ornamented materials. The aristocratic elite of Hatra adopted the bobbed hairstyles, headdresses, and belted tunics worn by the nobility belonging to the central Arsacid court. The trouser-suit was even worn by the Arsacid kings, as shown on the reverse images of coins. The Parthian trouser- suit was also adopted in Palmyra, Syria, along with the use of Parthian frontality in art. Parthian sculptures depict wealthy women wearing long- sleeved robes over a dress, with necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and headdresses bedecked in jewelry. Their many-folded dresses were fastened by a brooch at one shoulder. Their headdresses also featured a veil which was draped backwards. As seen in Parthian coinage, the headdresses worn by the Parthian kings changed over time. The earliest Arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft cap with cheek flaps, known as the bashlyk (Greek: kyrbasia). This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the pointy hats depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and Persepolis.; see also for comparison with Achaemenid satrapal headdresses The earliest coins of Mithridates I show him wearing the soft cap, yet coins from the latter part of his reign show him for the first time wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem.; Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian tiara, embroidered with pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly worn in the late Parthian period and by Sasanian monarchs.; Language As culturally and religiously tolerant as the Parthians were, they adopted Greek as their official language, while Aramaic remained the lingua franca in the empire. The native Parthian language, Middle Persian, and Akkadian were also used. Writing and literature Parthian long-necked lute, c. 3 BC ‚Äì 3 AD It is known that during the Parthian period the court minstrel (g≈çsƒÅn) recited poetic oral literature accompanied by music. However, their stories, composed in verse form, were not written down until the subsequent Sassanian period. In fact, there is no known Parthian-language literature that survives in original form; all of the surviving texts were written down in the following centuries. It is believed that such stories as the romantic tale Vis and RƒÅmin and epic cycle of the Kayanian dynasty were part of the corpus of oral literature from Parthian times, although compiled much later. Although literature of the Parthian language was not committed to written form, there is evidence that the Arsacids acknowledged and respected written Greek literature.; see also Chronological table of Parthian kings See also *Assyria (Roman province) *Baghdad Battery *Battle of Nisibis (217) *Arsacid dynasty of Armenia *Arsacid dynasty of Iberia *Arsacid dynasty of Caucasian Albania *Romans in Persia *History of Iran *Inscription of Parthian imperial power *List of Zoroastrian states and dynasties Notes References * .  * . * . * . * . * . * .  .  . * . * . * . * . * (paperback). * . * . * . * . * . * .  .  . * . * . * . * .  .  * .  .     . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * Further reading  External links * Various articles from Iran Chamber Society (Parthian Empire, The Art of Parthians, Parthian Army) *Parthia.com (a website featuring the history, geography, coins, arts and culture of ancient Parthia, including a bibliographic list of scholarly sources) Category:Former countries in Asia Category:Former empires in Asia Category:Seleucid Empire successor states Category:States and territories established in the 3rd century BC Category:States and territories disestablished in the 3rd century Category:247 BC Category:240s BC establishments Category:224 disestablishments Category:Iranian empires Category:Arsacid dynasty Category:Ancient history of Afghanistan Category:Classical Anatolia Category:Ancient history of the Caucasus Category:History of Turkmenistan Category:Ancient Near East Category:Superpowers Category:History of Western Asia ","title":"Parthian Empire"},{"id":"4501205","title":"Paddy Finucane"},{"id":"4501230","text":"Lake Isom is a small natural lake located in Lake County, Tennessee immediately south of Reelfoot Lake.

It is the creation of Karsten Obarski, a German software developer and composer at a game development company EAS.Collins source says the company is Reline but Obarski speaks of EAS in the interview for Bitfellas  History  Soundtracker started as a tool for game sound development for the Amiga. The program allowed for four-channel hardware mixing on all Amiga computers, but unlike subsequent versions, limited the number of samples/instruments in a song to 15. It allocated the four channels in strict fashion: melody (lead), accompaniment, bass, and percussion. It could export the tracks as a sequence of assembly instructions. Soundtracker was released as a commercial product in mid 1987. It did not enjoy success as a general music development software, with reviews calling it \\"illogical\\", \\"difficult\\" and \\"temperamental\\"; it was eclipsed in that market by programs such as Aegis' Sonix and Electronic Arts' Deluxe Music Construction Set. It became however a standard for games sound on the Amiga. The original code of Sound Tracker was disassembled and the modified versions of the program were spread across the burgeoning Amiga underground. A disk of instrument samples (ST-01) was distributed together with the program. In 1989, the program was improved upon by two Swedish programmers, Pex ‚ÄúMahoney‚Äù Tufvesson and Anders ‚ÄúKaktus‚Äù Berkeman, who released a version known as NoiseTracker. Some versions turned out to be incompatible with the Amiga OS 2.0, causing crashes. ProTracker was another successor, released in 1991, which solved the stability problems and made several changes to the user interface.

The plasma collisionality u^* is defined asNucl. Fusion, Vol. 39, No. 12 (1999)Wenzel, K and Sigmar, D.. Nucl. Fusion 30, 1117 (1990) : u^* = u_\\\\mathrm{ei}\\\\,\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m_\\\\mathrm{e}}{k_\\\\mathrm{B} T_\\\\mathrm{e}}}\\\\,\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon^\\\\frac{3}{2}}\\\\,qR, where u_\\\\mathrm{ei} denotes the electron-ion collision frequency, R is the major radius of the plasma, \\\\epsilon is the inverse aspect-ratio, and q is the safety factor. The plasma parameters m_\\\\mathrm{i} and T_\\\\mathrm{i} denote, respectively, the mass and temperature of the ions, and k_\\\\mathrm{B} is the Boltzmann constant. Electron temperature Temperature is a statistical quantity whose formal definition is :T = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial S}\\\\right)_{V,N}, or the change in internal energy with respect to entropy, holding volume and particle number constant. A practical definition comes from the fact that the atoms, molecules, or whatever particles in a system have an average kinetic energy. The average means to average over the kinetic energy of all the particles in a system. If the velocities of a group of electrons, e.g., in a plasma, follow a Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution, then the electron temperature is defined as the temperature of that distribution. For other distributions, not assumed to be in equilibrium or have a temperature, two-thirds of the average energy is often referred to as the temperature, since for a Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution with three degrees of freedom, \\\\langle E \\\\rangle = (3/2)\\\\, k_\\\\text{B} T. The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K), but using the above relation the electron temperature is often expressed in terms of the energy unit electronvolt (eV). Each kelvin (1 K) corresponds to 8.617 333 262...√ó10‚àí5 eV; this factor is the ratio of the Boltzmann constant to the elementary charge. Each eV is equivalent to 11,605 kelvins, which can be calculated by the relation \\\\langle E \\\\rangle = k_\\\\text{B} T. The electron temperature of a plasma can be several orders of magnitude higher than the temperature of the neutral species or of the ions. This is a result of two facts. Firstly, many plasma sources heat the electrons more strongly than the ions. Secondly, atoms and ions are much heavier than electrons, and energy transfer in a two-body collision is much more efficient if the masses are similar. Therefore, equilibration of the temperature happens very slowly, and is not achieved during the time range of the observation.

It is charged with observing and analyzing the phenomenon of sectarian movements (cults), coordinating the government response, informing the public about the risks arising from sectarian aberrations and facilitating the implementation of actions to aid the victims.Report to the Prime Minister, MIVILUDES, 2003. Functions According to the first article of the Decree N¬∞ 2002-1392 of November 28, 2002, the MIVILUDES is charged with: # Observing and analyzing the phenomenon of sectarian movements whose practices are prejudicial to human rights and basic liberties, constitute a menace to public order, or are in conflict with existing laws and regulations; # Favoring, in the respect of public liberties, the coordination of preventive and repressive action by the authorities against such practices; # Developing the exchange of information between public services on administrative practices relating to the combat against sectarian aberrations; # Contributing to the informing and training of public agents in this area; # Informing the public about the risks and, in some cases, the dangers, arising from sectarian aberrations, and facilitating the implementation of actions to aid the victims of such practices; # Participating in activities relating to issues falling within its scope undertaken at the international level by the ministry of foreign affairs. MIVILUDES provides information related to \\"cultic deviances\\" to the media, the French government, and individual members of the public. It recommends contacts and other organizations, and produces and archives documentation and discussion papers on groups considered cults.Mission Interminist√©rielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les D√ârives Sectaires  History  Background The French authorities created MIVILUDES as the successor to MILS (Mission interminist√©rielle de lutte contre les sectes; English: \\"Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Cults\\"), which itself functioned from 7 October 1998 as the successor to the Observatoire interminist√©riel sur les sectes established on 9 May 1996. These organisations were in charge of co-ordinating government monitoring of cults. In February 1998, MILS, headed by Alain Vivien, released its annual report on their monitoring of cults in France. The operations of MILS, and Alain Vivien's background as the head of an anti-cult organization (he had served as President of the Centre Roger Ikor from 1997 to 1998), had occasionally received criticism from several human-rights organizations, such as the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, as well as the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a US government agency. (See also About-Picard law#Reactions). In January 1999 Vivien requested and received police protection following threats and the burglary of his home.L'Humanit√©, January 14, 1999; Vivien resigned in June 2002 under criticism.

Jean-Louis Langlais, a senior civil-servant at the Ministry of the Interior, served as its president from 2002 to 2005. Announcing the formation of MIVILUDES, the French government acknowledged the criticism that MILS had received from outside France for certain activities that could be considered in violation of religious freedom. Then this decree repealed the decree of 7 October 1998 establishing MILS. In an interview in March 2003, Langlais categorised the fight as not against \\"sects\\", but against \\"sectarian deviances\\". He stated that current French law lacks a definition for a \\"sect\\" and, therefore \\"the law cannot define sectarian deviances\\". Nevertheless, he portrayed the role of MIVILUDES as contributing to \\"defining what could simply be an administrative jurisprudence\\".'France and \\"cults\\": a new orientation' - Interview with Jean-Louis Langlais, by Willy Fautr√©.

These cars were produced until about 1915, predominantly in the United States.  Design  High wheelers were derived from horse-drawn wagons, and often were conversions of these. Similarly to these wagons, they often feature wood-spoke wheels, suspensions and boxy wooden bodies. The large-diameter slender wheels were frequently with solid rubber tires, to provide ample ground clearance on the primitive roads of the late 19th century. These cars were produced in many body styles. The most common were the motorized wagon (utility vehicle) runabout, roadster and buggy, some with detachable tonneaus.  History  Before gasoline engines became widely available, high wheelers were powered by electric motors or steam engines.

In 1798, she replaced Catherine Nelidova as the chief mistress. Family She was the daughter of Pyotr Vasilyevich Lopukhin, from the Lopukhin family, one of the oldest families of Russian nobility, which owed its distinction to Eudoxia Lopukhina's marriage to Peter the Great and of which the unfortunate Natalia Lopukhina was also a member. Royal mistress Her life changed the day Paul cast an eye on her during a ball in 1796. His tenderness towards her was noted by a court faction which hoped to use her as a remedy against the influence of the Empress Maria Feodorovna. The Emperor was told that the girl, hopelessly in love with him, was on the verge of killing herself on that account. When Paul ordered her family to be brought to Saint Petersburg, the Empress ineffectually attempted to interfere and sent an angry letter to Lopukhina pressing her to stay at home. The letter was intercepted and presented to the emperor in the most unfavourable light, thus sparking a quarrel between the spouses and ensuring Lopukhina's ascendance at court. After Anna was brought to the capital, the Emperor appointed her father General Procurator and made him Prince with the title of His Serene Highness. Anna herself was showered with awards, including the Order of Saint John. On Paul's urging, the translation of her Hebrew name ‚Äì \\"grace\\" ‚Äì was given to warships and inscribed on the standards of the imperial guards. All things considered, Lopukhina's influence on the tsar's irascible character is reckoned to have been beneficial, although the Emperor's constant attention seemed to importune her so much that in 1799 she asked his permission to marry a childhood friend, Prince Pavel Gagarin. After the sovereign acquiesced, Gagarin was recalled from Alexander Suvorov's army then fighting in Italy and the wedding took place on 11 January 1800. The marriage was also to protect her from public spite. Later life and death A year later, the Emperor was murdered and the Gagarins proceeded to Turin, where her husband Prince Gagarin was appointed ambassador. Theirs was a marriage of convenience, and he seems to have had little reason for grief when she died of consumption in 1805 at the age of 27. Anna's body was brought back to the Russian capital, where her tomb may be seen in the St Lazarus Church of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

He is chiefly remembered as the last Member of Parliament to be expelled from the House of Commons, after his arrest for forgery,\\"Mr. Peter Baker\\" (Obituary), The Times, 15 November 1966, p. 12. and as the inspiration behind the eccentric character of publisher Martin York in Muriel Spark's novel A Far Cry From Kensington.British poet and critic Derek Stanford's chronicles of the Neo-Romantic movement during the forties untitled Inside the Forties, Literary Memoirs, 1937‚Äì1957 give some insight into Baker's character.Stanford is also one of the main protagonists of \\"A Far Cry From Kensington\\", he appeared as the unfortunate writer Harold Bartlett, nicknamed by Mrs Hawkins, Le pisseur de copies (he urinates frightful proses). Baker's arrest and trial received extensive media coverage from both the British and the International press. Early life and family Baker was born 20 April 1921 in Willesden, north west London. He was the son of Major Reginald Poynton Baker (1896‚Äì1985) of Loddenden Manor, Staplehurst, Kent,\\"Dod's Parliamentary Companion 1952\\", Business Dictionaries Ltd., London, 1952, p. 277. and his first wife Gwendolyn Emily Christabel Baker n√©e Webb (1897‚Äì1962). Baker's father later became a successful movie producer based at Ealing Studios.Muriel Spark, \\"Curriculum Vitae\\", New Directions Publishing, 2011, p. 196. Baker tried to create a fictional connection with the Tudor Bakers of Sissinghurst Castle, Kent, whose members included Sir John Baker,\\"Foreign News Young Wizard\\", \\"Time Magazine\\", 13 December 1954. a Chancellor of the Exchequer and Speaker of the House of Commons in the 16th century; Sir Richard Baker,\\"Time Out of Life\\", pp. 213‚Äì214. an author who was also a Member of Parliament; Sir Samuel White Baker,\\"My Testament\\", p. 247.In \\"My Testament\\", p. 247, Falcon Press published in 1949 a work on Sir Samuel White Baker untitled Baker of the Nile, written by Dorothy Middleton (1909‚Äì1999).

Baker made another bogus claim, mentioning in his memoirs that St. Luke's Chapel, otherwise known as St-Mary-in-the-Marsh and situated inside Norwich Cathedral, had been the site since 1586 of his family weddings and christenings. In fact, it was only used on one occasion by his ancestors, in June 1744 for a quiet wedding. Nevertheless, this Lady chapel was chosen by Baker as the venue for his youngest daughter's christening. On 5 June 1948 Baker married Gloria Mae Heaton-Armstrong, daughter of Colonel Charles George William Stacpool Heaton-Armstrong, at Kensington. The Heaton- Armstrong family belonged to the Anglo-Irish Protestant landowning class and were related to soldier and MP Sir Thomas Armstrong.\\"A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 1\\", by Bernard Burke. Armstrong was involved in the Rye House Plot. Education and military service Baker was educated at Eastbourne College. He was preparing to study at the University of Cambridge until the imminent outbreak of World War II led him to enlist in the Royal Artillery.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 11‚Äì14. Although he could have taken an immediate commission, Baker and a friend who had joined up at the same time determined to serve at least six months in the ranks\\"My Testament\\", p. 15. before accepting a posting to an Officer Cadet Training Unit in Catterick Garrison in March 1940. He was then posted to an artillery regiment based in Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire, and served for fourteen months across southern Scotland.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 19‚Äì20. He was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant on 7 September 1940. Considering the job of an artillery officer boring, Baker accepted in October 1941 a posting to be a Staff Captain in Military Intelligence based at the War Office. He hoped that the new appointment would make it more likely that he could obtain an overseas posting.\\"My Testament\\", p. 23. After four months he applied for a transfer, although it took a further six months to persuade his superiors to let him leave.\\"My Testament\\", p. 24. Phantom He was assigned to the GHQ Liaison Regiment (known as Phantom),The regimental badge was a white letter P on a black background.\\"SAS Heroes Remarkable Soldiers, Extraordinary Men\\", by Peter Scholey, published by Osprey Publishing 2009. a mysterious unit established by Major-General George Frederick Hopkinson, commander of the 1st Airborne Division. Phantom was renowned for the unusual selection of brilliance, nobility and idiosyncrasy, wit, achievements and even criminality exhibited by its officers. Following training and exercises in Britain, Baker was assigned in June 1943 to the Phantom unit in North Africa at camp Bugeaud in B√¥ne, Algeria. The unit consisted of three squadrons (E, K and H) and the Assault Detachment under the command of Major Mervyn Sydney Bobus Vernon (1912‚Äì1991) of the Grenadier Guards. Baker joined E squadron, which was headed by Major Hugh Fraser. E squadron was supposed to have followed the Assault Detachment (led by Christopher Mayhew) into Sicily, but the invasion turned out to be much easier than anticipated.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 25‚Äì27. At the end of August, E squadron was ordered to Bizerta to be ready to take part in the invasion of Italy. The squadron's role was to carry out long-range reconnaissance, which it did initially from Taranto. Baker, with a small team, drove an unarmoured and lightly-armed jeep up to a hundred miles from the forward base to discover the location of German troops.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 37‚Äì38. Late in 1943 the squadron withdrew to Trani, where Baker developed abdominal pains; he was flown back to Britain before Christmas, and was given four weeks' sick leave before being passed as fit for sedentary duty only.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 61‚Äì62. He was then recruited by MI9, and was offered and accepted the command of a small reconnaissance and intelligence unit which was part of Intelligence School 9 (Western European Area).M. R. D. Foot and James Langley, \\"MI9: Escape and Evasion\\", Bodley Head, 1979, p. 218. I.S.9 (W.E.A.) was a small executive branch formed by Airey Neave and Jimmy Langley (after the war IS 9 was transformed into the 23 SAS Regiment based in the MidlandsPaul Routledge, \\"Public Servant, Secret Agent\\", Fourth Estate, 2002.). Baker's role was to run and reorganise resistance groups and escape routes in France and Belgium in preparation for the forthcoming landings in France on D-Day; his section was attached to 21st Army Group under the ultimate command of SHAEF.Airey Neave, \\"Saturday at M.I.9\\", Hodder and Stroughton, 1969, pp. 261‚Äì262. Assembling near Portsmouth at the end of May 1944, and crossed into France on D-Day itself\\"Confession of Faith\\", Falcon Press, London, 1946, p. 78. (with the unit's support equipment crossing seven days later).\\"My Testament\\", pp. 62‚Äì63. Baker found that the established 'ratlines' for helping escapers to get out of France were significantly disrupted by the landings, and the French Resistance was increasingly interested in becoming an overt force. With assistance only from his second-in-command Captain Pringle Dunn and eight French agents, his unit were able to arrange for 146 people ('escaping Allied airmen or prisoners of war, evaders left over from unsuccessful attacks on D-Day and important political refugees') to get to Britain.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 75‚Äì76. In Operation Marathon he volunteered to go beyond the front lines to rescue a group of 152 Allied pilots who were hidden in the Fr√©teval Forest near Ch√¢teaudun.Airey Neave, \\"They Have their Exits\\", Hodder and Stoughton, 1953, p. 158. He followed the Allied armies into Paris and Brussels when they were liberated, before arriving in the Netherlands and basing his unit in Eindhoven in September 1944. He formed links with the Dutch resistance (including with Christiaan Lindemans, codenamed 'King Kong')Anne Laurens, \\"The Lindemans affair\\", Allan Wingate, 1971. and with help from informants was able to send back to London details of a number of new weapons including the V-2 rocketThe V-2 schematics were brought with the Peenem√ºnde files at White Sands for analysis and afterwards studied by North American Aviation's chief scientist Dr .William Bollay, a former von K√°rm√°n's student and a member of the 1936 GALCIT Rocket Research Project.Bollay made new additions, including a more powerful engine.Von braun borrowed heavily from Bolley's engine for the Redstone rocket. and the type of fuel they used\\"Was Arnhem Betrayed ?\\", Encounter, June 1981, pp. 8‚Äì14.

Contribution to World War II Baker's accomplishment in Eindhoven would pave the way for the development (Phase I) of the Navaho rocket,\\"After Sputnik The First Fifty Years of Space Flight\\", by Martin Collins, published by the Smithsmosian Institution, p. 30.The Navaho rocket shared some similarities with its German predecessor, the ill-fated A-4b (V-2) program, a stepstone into space exploration. a modified V-2 with wings (delta planform), which eventually laid the foundation for numerous technologies including the Intercontinental ballistic missile and the Apollo program. *For details on Phase II see Operation Paperclip. *For further details on the capture of Eindhoven see The Alsos Mission Taken prisoner Baker's relationship with his commanding officer Airey Neave was difficult. Although Baker claimed to be an \\"old and esteemed friend\\",\\"My Testament\\", p. 89. Neave was wary of his interest in writing accounts of his activities for the American press (while admiring Baker's 'dash and enthusiasm').Paul Routledge, \\"Public Servant, Secret Agent\\", Fourth Estate, 2002, p. 146. In early October, Baker and Neave moved their unit to just west of Nijmegen,\\"My Testament\\", p. 121. and Neave obtained permission to send Baker (codenamed 'Harrier') through enemy lines to make contact with the Dutch Resistance. Neave was given permission provided Baker remained in his British Army uniform and did not leave the safe house.Airey Neave, \\"Saturday at M.I.9\\", Hodder and Stoughton, 1969, p. 285. On 11 October Neave took Baker and Private First Class Theodore Bachenheimer\\"My Testament\\", p. 133. (from the 504th Parachute Infantry in the US Army) to the River Waal,\\"Public Servant, Secret Agent\\", p. 152. where they crossed in a canoe, and eventually made contact with the Resistance. The same canoe was used to bring out Dutch diplomat Herman van Roijen (later Dutch foreign minister) with critical intelligence information for his government in exile.Airey Neave, \\"Saturday at M.I.9\\", Hodder and Stroughton, 1969, p. 287. Baker smoothed over differences between two Resistance groups,\\"My Testament\\", pp. 138‚Äì143. but disobeyed orders by exchanging his military uniform for civilian clothes and going to stay at a farmhouse where, hosted by the Ebbens family,\\"My Testament\\", pp. 131‚Äì133. he and PFC Bachenheimer went for walks around the area within sight of German troops.\\"Saturday at M.I.9\\", pp. 287‚Äì288. On the night of 16‚Äì17 October the house was raided by German forces with Baker and Bachenheimer arrested while sleeping and taken as prisoner of war; the Ebbens family were all shot. Escape attempt After interrogation he was taken to a transit camp at Culemborg, and was then marched 45 km on foot to another transit camp at Amersfoort.My Testament, pp. 147‚Äì148. From there a five-day train journey took him to Stalag XI-B at Bad Fallingbostel where he was to stay until sent on to Oflag 79 in Braunschweig.My Testament, pp. 151‚Äì152. During the journey, PFC Bachenheimer escaped, but was shot by German forces near the village of 't Harde on the night of 22‚Äì23 October.Phil Nordyke, More than Courage, Zenith Press, 2008, p. 290. Baker was forced to abandon his own plans to escape from the train,My Testament, pp. 150‚Äì151. but on arriving at Fallingbostel noticed that escape was possible there. He joined with a Belgian officer and a Malagasy French liaison officer named Jacques HannebicqueMy Testament, p. 154. to make plans.My Testament, p. 159. Baker's group of three passed themselves off as French prisoners and joined a work party which was sent out of the prison camp to collect firewood on the morning of 7 November. When the party got to the wood they broke away and started walking west. Baker claimed that \\"the most effective way to pass unsuspected was to salute everybody in uniform\\", whether military or civilian.My Testament, p. 165. The three had got 60 km away from their camp after two days, when they were detected by a German soldier, and failed in their bluff of being 'Men of confidence' (who were trusted to take charge of other prisoners of war). Baker decided to reveal his real identity long before he was given over to the Gestapo, to avoid mistreatment in their hands;My Testament, p. 173. however he believed they were only saved from being shot as spies when the farmer where they were discovered objected to the shooting happening on his land.My Testament, p. 175. He was sent to Stalag X-B at Sandbostel where he was interrogated with violence, and then spent 35 days in solitary confinement in various prisons before finally going to Oflag 79.My Testament, pp. 181‚Äì182. His fellow escapee Hannebicque survived the war and later became a respected writer and photographer.Jacques Hannebicque, Madagascar, ma terre-aux-mille- contrastes, Editions Silo√´, Paris 1989. Arising out of his escape plans, Baker and his colleagues were court-martialed for forging leave passes. The Gestapo and the prosecution initially asked for the death penalty, but later altered it to six weeks in a punishment camp. They were actually sentenced to twenty- eight days' solitary confinement, of which twenty-five days were deducted because they had only previously had a sentence of ten days.My Testament, pp. 196‚Äì199. During the spring of 1945, rations ran short in the camp as the Allied armies moved closer, and the camp was liberated on 12 April 1945 by the US Ninth Army. Baker got permission to make his own way home and drove in a requisitioned Mercedes to Venlo, from where he flew to Ghent and then back to London.My Testament, p. 209. He weighed 7 stone 2 lbs when he returned to England.My Testament, p. 200. On 2 August 1945, Captain Peter Baker (148257) of the Intelligence Corps, Staplehurst, Kent was awarded the Military Cross in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in North-West Europe. Post war As early as 1940 Baker had found himself in charge of editing a broadsheet of poems, including some he had himself written. The collection was known as the \\"Resurgam Poets\\". Baker later adopted the pseudonym 'Colin Strang' to edit two anthologies and write poetry reviews for newspapers and magazines, until he was posted to Africa.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 20‚Äì22. In early 1944, while he was back in Britain, Baker's poem sequence \\"The Land of Prester John\\" was published, to what he thought was a poor critical reception.\\"My Testament\\", p. 63. After the war Baker became a publisher with financial backing from his father; the company he founded, Falcon Press, was named after the armoured car which Baker had used during the war. As wartime paper rationing was continuing and Falcon Press was a newcomer without a large quota, he printed books in several foreign countries instead. The business was initially successful, enabling Baker to build up a \\"minor business empire\\" including four publishing companies, printing works, a wine merchants and a whisky distillery, aircraft research company, and a property business.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 210‚Äì212. Muriel Spark worked for Falcon Press from 1951. When Falcon Press ran into debt, Baker and Robert Maxwell (then making his name as a leading British publisher) planned to merge their respective publishing businesses; however the plans fell through.\\"My Testament\\", p. 240. Maxwell eventually bought the British Book Centre in New York from Baker in 1952.Joe Haines, \\"Maxwell\\", Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1988, p. 147. He was a frequent visitor at the \\"Thursday Club\\",\\"My Testament\\", p. 243. a raffish luncheon club located at Wheeler's oyster bar, in Old Compton Street, London, a men's eating and drinking group dedicated to \\"Absolute Inconsequence\\";The Thursday club's spirit was that friends would meet once a week, no issues of importance would be allowed, no international question would be solved, eat well, tell stories and swap reminiscences. other members included the actors David Niven, James Robertson Justice and Peter Ustinov, the future Duke of Edinburgh, the intelligence officer Kim Philby, celebrity photographer Stirling Henry Nahum, (known as Baron) and Baker's friend, Colonel Sean Fielding, editor of Tatler magazine and later of the Daily Express. Baker was also a member of the Junior Carlton Club\\"Who's who of British members of parliament, 1945‚Äì1979\\", published by Harvester Press, 1981, p. 15. Political career While a prisoner of war, Baker wrote an essay \\"in political diagnosis\\" to explain to a fellow prisoner why he supported the Conservative Party. After the war, he published the essay as \\"The Silent Revolution.Peter Baker, \\"The Silent Revolution\\", Falcon Press, 1946, p. 7. He added an epilogue written late in 1945, giving some of his diary entries for the latter part of the war and reflecting on the impact of peace on the purposefulness of the wartime generation.\\"The Silent Revolution\\", p. 43. At the same time he also completed his war memoirs, which he had begun writing while a prisoner of war; the resulting book was titled \\"Confession of Faith\\", and was also published by his own publishing company Falcon Press in 1946.\\"Confession of Faith\\", Falcon Press, London, 1946, p. 8. Persuaded by his friend James Thomas, at the time Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party, to enter active politics, Baker agreed to let his name go forward for selection as the Conservative Party candidate for South Norfolk. The South Norfolk division was near where he had grown up, but Baker found that the local Conservatives were divided between an official Conservative Association and an Independent Conservative Association.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 213‚Äì214. The South Norfolk Independent Conservative Association had been set up by supporters of John Holt Wilson in 1944, after a dispute over the previous selection.F. W. S. Craig, \\"British Parliamentary Election Results 1918‚Äì49\\", 3rd edition, Parliamentary Research Services, Chichester, 1983, p. 434. Although feelings between the two Associations were still tense, both participated in the selection. Baker won easily, beating Eric Smith and John Holt Wilson. He had already decided that he needed to reunify local Conservatives, and brokered a joint constitution in which officers of both would be represented at every level. His solution was accepted despite breaking most of the model rules sent by Conservative Central Office.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 215‚Äì217. Parliament In the 1950 general election Baker won his seat with a total of 18,143 votes, beating the Labour candidate Christopher Mayhew (15,714 votes) who was the poll favourite. Aged 28, he was then the youngest MP (\\"Baby of the House\\"). He was returned again in the 1951 general election and took an interest in agricultural matters in Parliament. In June 1953, Baker invited US Senator Joseph McCarthy to come to England and see Democracy at work and even offered to put McCarthy up at his London home or at his house in Pulham St Mary, Norfolk.\\"McCarthy Invited to see 'Democracy' in Britain\\", The New York Times, 12 June 1953, p. 11.\\"Invites McCarthy to UK to see Democracy Work\\", Ottawa Citizen, 12 June 1953, p. 4. He later became chairman of an ill-fated movement called the Company of Commonwealth Venturers\\"Commonwealth Venturers, $1,000,000 Fund Appeal\\", The Glasgow Herald, 20 July 1953, p. 3.\\"New company formed\\", The Straits Times, 4 August 1953, p. 10. whose main goal was to promote a 'new Elizabethan Age' among Commonwealth countries. Baker improvised a Pageant to fill the Royal Albert Hall in 1954, 15,000 supporters wanted the 8,000 seats available.\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. 1.\\"My Testament\\", p. 255. Health When he had arrived back in Britain at the end of the war, Baker's doctor had given him a check-up and told him to take six months' rest, the first half in bed, as his heart was in a poor state. The military authorities also recommended two small operations. Baker disregarded their advice and went straight into business.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 209‚Äì210. Baker suffered a nervous breakdown in 1954, which he ascribed to his excessive workload as both a member of parliament and a businessman single-handedly running many companies (which were in financial difficulties). He claimed to have had multiple day- time blackouts and to have attempted suicide twice before he became a voluntary patient in a nursing home.\\"My Testament\\", pp. 256‚Äì257. In May 1954 he announced that he would not seek re-election due to ill-health.\\"News in Brief.\\" Times [London, England] 10 May 1954: 4. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 27 November 2012. While in the nursing home he agreed to revise his war memoirs \\"Confession of Faith\\" and add his post-war life story, which he intended to be published under the title \\"Testament of Faith\\".\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. 55. Downfall Falcon Press began encountering financial difficulties in the early 1950s. The official receiver was called in to Falcon Press (London) Ltd in 1954, and discovered a total deficiency of ¬£290,823. A creditors' meeting in July 1954 was told that the company was \\"well on the rocks\\" by March 1950, and so often had a sheriff's officer attended at the company offices that the staff had bought a wreath on learning of his death. With Baker himself in the nursing home, his father (who was also a director) claimed that high production costs, insufficiently selective choice of books to publish and insufficient sales pressure, were responsible for the failure. When Baker's companies came into financial trouble, he forged signatures on letters purporting to guarantee their debts.The Glasgow Herald, 11 September 1954, MP remanded in custody. Baker was arrested and charged with seven counts of uttering forged documents, and pleaded guilty to six of the counts. Prosecuting counsel were Christmas Humphreys and Mervyn Griffith-Jones, while Baker was defended by Richard Levy and James Burge.\\"Time out of Life\\", p. 2. He was subsequently convicted on all seven counts and was sentenced at the Old Bailey to seven years imprisonment.\\"Sentence on M.P.\\", The Times, 1 December 1954, p. 8. See also \\"Certified copies of the indictment, conviction and sentence of the Court in the case of the Queen against Peter Arthur David Baker\\", House of Commons Paper 11 of session 1954‚Äì55. Immediately on his imprisonment at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs, Baker was given permission by the Prison Governor to write to the Speaker of the House of Commons.In \\"Time Out of Life\\", pp. 31‚Äì32, Baker claims he had to write a second time because the Wormwood Scrubs authorities always tore up the first letter any prisoner sent to an MP. Explaining that he had discovered he was \\"unable to vacate my seat in any way while the matter was sub judice\\", he stated that he was not going to appeal and therefore \\"you can now dispossess me of my seat without delay\\".Publisher's note, \\"My Testament\\", p. 288. The Leader of the House of Commons Harry Crookshank then put down a motion \\"That Mr. Peter Arthur David Baker be expelled this House\\" which was agreed without a division on 16 December 1954.Hansard, HC 5ser vol 535 col 1986. In the subsequent by-election in January 1955, South Norfolk elected Conservative John Hill as its new MP. Prison Baker's literary agent Anthony Blond and publisher John Calder were allowed to visit him occasionally to discuss the publication of his book, for which he had left only \\"a chaotic welter of hand-written chapters, and extracts from articles, newspaper interviews and broadcasts\\" which Blond and Calder had to assemble into a logical sequence. Blond and Calder eventually published the book under the title My Testament, which Baker had not approved. While in Wormwood Scrubs, Baker met up with Raymond Blackburn, a former MP who had also been imprisoned for fraud. Baker had not known Blackburn well when in Parliament (Blackburn had been a Labour MP) but had become friendly with him afterwards.\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. 45. On 12 May 1955, during the general election campaign, Baker was taken from prison to the Bankruptcy court for his public examination. His liabilities were stated as ¬£335,598 8s 10d, and he had assets of ¬£10 19s 1d. Baker presented the court with 212 pages of evidence,\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. 89. and spent three hours in the witness box. He blamed his bankruptcy on the withdrawal of support by Sir Bernard Docker, and at the end of his evidence he asserted that his plea of guilty had been incorrect. Appeal During his evidence, Baker had told the court that he intended to petition for a retrial; he had previously decided that he would only do so after he had been expelled from the House of Commons, and a by- election in South Norfolk and a general election had been held.\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. 83. As he was bankrupt, his legal case was funded by friends including William Rees-Mogg, Anthony Nutting, William Teeling, Martha Gellhorn and his legal adviser Hugh Quennell.\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. 125. Baker duly petitioned to the Home Secretary in May 1955, asking for either a retrial, an appeal out of time (with permission to change his plea to not guilty), a public inquiry, or an immediate release.\\"Time Out of Life\\", pp. 91‚Äì92. Talks between Baker's solicitors and the Home Office were inconclusive,\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. 110. so Baker's solicitors applied to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Mr Justice Donovan refused Baker permission for leave to appeal out of time against his conviction on the papers, so Baker renewed his appeal at a hearing in the Court of Criminal Appeal on 21 November 1955. The hearing was adjourned on application of Baker's counsel, because they were not ready.\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. 118. Baker later claimed that Hugh Quennell had obtained assurances that the Home Office intended to procure his release by March 1956 at the outside, and so he reluctanctly agreed to withdraw his appeal and let the Home Office proceed.\\"Time Out of Life\\", pp. 118‚Äì119. The appeal was withdrawn on 16 December, his solicitors announcing that there were legal and technical difficulties in appealing after a guilty plea and in arranging a new trial. Baker's memorandum to the Home Office was met only with an official rejection. Second appeal At the end of 1956 Baker prepared a second application for leave to appeal, with his solicitor Brian Hetreed preparing a large bundle of documents and witnesses (including, according to Baker, two former Chief Justices). However junior counsel John Mathew was doubtful of the chances of a retrial unless Baker had been insane when he pleaded guilty. On 28 January 1957 Baker was indeed refused leave to appeal, to argue for a change of plea, for extension of time, to call new witnesses and to produce new evidence, with the Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard pointing out that his plea of guilty must stand.\\"Time Out of Life\\", pp. 156‚Äì158. Immediately after this appeal was dismissed, Baker was transferred from Wormwood Scrubs to HM Prison Leyhill, an open prison.\\"Time Out of Life\\", pp. 158‚Äì159. From there Baker sent a request to the Speaker of the House of Commons asking that his case be referred to the Committee of Privileges, to inquire into why he pleaded guilty and to allegations of perjury and withholding of evidence. He claimed to have received \\"more than seventy letters of encouragement\\" when his request was publicised.\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. 166. His attempts to circumvent restrictions on letters from prison were detected and resulted in his transfer back to closed conditions, first at Horfield\\"Time Out of Life\\", pp. 184‚Äì185. and then back to Wormwood Scrubs.\\"Time Out of Life\\", pp. 189‚Äì190. Release Baker was released from Wormwood Scrubs on 23 October 1959, being met at the prison gates by his father and by Lord Pakenham. Shortly after his release he gave an interview to the Daily Express, in which he declared his intention to bring back his wife and children from Australia, where they had moved without warning in the summer of 1958, leaving no address but arranging for letters to be forwarded through a bank.\\"Time Out of Life\\", pp. 231‚Äì233. On 4 November, Baker called a press conference on \\"the weaknesses of justice and prison administration in Britain\\", which he explained as an apology for hiding from the press, and an attempt to prove that this was not from fear.\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. 245. Later life Baker's creditors received only 0.1611d. in the ¬£ (or 0.067%), in the first dividend paid after his bankruptcy; when he applied for discharge from bankruptcy on 17 December 1959, the discharge was suspended. In April 1962 his discharge from bankruptcy was allowed after a two years and six months suspension. A supplemental dividend was paid to creditors in May 1963 of 0.196d. in the ¬£ (or 0.08%), making less than 0.15% in total. In February 1960, Baker asked Robert Maxwell for an appointment as a Director of his new publishing company; Maxwell refused.Joe Haines, \\"Maxwell\\", Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1988, p. 147. He wrote his prison memoirs, published under the title Time Out of Life by Heinemann in 1961; in them Baker claimed his financial downfall was caused by his financial guarantors repudiating their signatures, and that he had always believed them to be genuine.\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. 81. He could not explain why he had pleaded guilty. The book included a foreword from Pakenham, by then the Earl of Longford, who praised it as a \\"valuable contribution\\" to understanding the prison system.\\"Time Out of Life\\", p. vii. In March 1961 he was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving,In \\"My Testament\\", p. 247, Baker acknowledged his careless driving in a 1949 dinner event, Baker offered British conservative Anthony Eden to drive him to the House of Commons, Baker drove so fast that he completed five circuits of the roundabout on the Embankment before delivering Eden, green and apprehensive, at the House. Eden never forgave Baker for that. having knocked down a pedestrian on a crossing in the Strand; Baker said that he overtook a taxi whose driver had signalled to him that it was safe to do so. He was divorced from his wife in November 1961, on grounds of her desertion. Attempts to overturn his conviction or to hold an inquiry continued. In September 1963 Baker persuaded Earl Attlee, former Labour Prime Minister, to support an inquiry. Baker unsuccessfully petitioned for a Royal Pardon in 1965. On 4 April 1966 his creditors filed a new bankruptcy petition against him; a receiving order was made on 22 July 1966, and on 26 September he was again adjudicated a bankrupt. He died in hospital in Eastbourne on 14 November 1966, aged 45. Literary depiction Baker is depicted as Martin York in Muriel Spark's novel A Far Cry from Kensington.Professor Martin Stannard, Muriel Spark. George Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2009. Chapter 19. York, like Baker, is sentenced to seven years' imprisonment \\"for multiple forgeries and other types of fraud\\"; the date of his imprisonment is also 1 December 1954.Muriel Spark, A Far Cry from Kensington. Constable, London, 1988, p. 85. In the novel, Nancy Hawkins (based on Spark) describes how Martin York frequently makes promises to publish books written by his friends, but the books they write are not always acceptable, and she turns down one manuscript from a friend of York's who had been offered a contract during a drinking session.A Far Cry from Kensington, pp. 44‚Äì45. York relays to Hawkins advice to send a cheque for a random amount in income tax, so that it cannot be tallied with any amount owing and results in the taxpayers' file being passed around and eventually lost.A Far Cry from Kensington, p. 40. She describes seeing York signing documents in his own handwriting but in other people's names.A Far Cry from Kensington, pp. 43‚Äì44. York remarks to Hawkins that \\"if it is widely enough believed that you have money and wealth, it is the same thing as having it.

The album features appearances by Tom Waits, PJ Harvey, John Parish, Nina Persson and Dave Fridmann. It was the band's most successful album commercially, selling over 63,000 copies. Recording history Mark Linkous recorded his first two albums, Good Morning Spider and Vivadixesubmarinetransmissionplot, in a small room inside his Virginia farm. There he worked by himself, providing all of the instrumentation and vocals for those albums. After the release of those albums, however, \\"the guy who hired me left [Capitol],\\" Linkous told Free Williamsburg Online Magazine in 2002, and his record label discouraged the solo-production process. As a result, It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life was the first Sparklehorse outing in which Linkous did not perform alone in his private studio. ‚ÄúI didn't want to play every instrument on every song,‚Äù said the songwriter. ‚ÄúI didn't want to be behind the control console the whole time. I wanted to have other people's brains and input involved.‚Äù Linkous played with a full band while recording It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life. He also worked with a wide array of guest musicians, which included PJ Harvey and Tom Waits. Linkous was reportedly incredibly nervous about contacting Waits. In an interview with The Guardian, Linkous admitted he had to take five shots of whiskey before gaining the courage to call the famous singer-songwriter. During the phone call, the two men planned a meeting in California. The meeting was quite unusual and took place inside an SUV as the two men rode down a California highway. Within the car they discussed possible album ideas, their least-favorite animals, and their mutual disgust for turkey vultures. Waits went on to record the song ‚ÄúDog Door‚Äù with Linkous on the album. It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life was recorded years after Linkous‚Äôs near-fatal drug overdose in a London hotel room. The incident received a large amount of media coverage and was documented within several music magazines, including Rolling Stone and Spin. Linkous frequently had to answer questions about his overdose during interviews. He was also chastised by some critics for the exceedingly sombre themes in his work. The album‚Äôs title track is a melancholy ode to the beauties of life. The chorus has Linkous faintly whispering, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wonderful life,‚Äù over and over, on top of lush orchestration in addition to looping electronic textures. Linkous declared the song was a \\"fuck-you\\" to journalists who couldn‚Äôt forget about his brush with death, or see the beauty hidden within his songs. Sonic Cinema All of the album's songs were made into music videos by various filmmakers, such as the Quay Brothers, Garine Torossian, Grant Gee, and Guy Maddin. These became the subject of the October 26, 2001, episode of the Sundance Channel series Sonic Cinema.\\"Sparklehorse Goes Sonic.\\" Retrieved from Rollingstone.com on March 17, 2008.

It describes in detail the main industries of early Pensacola: fishing/ice, clay/brickmaking, lumber, and transportation. The Building Built in 1884 for the Pensacola Ice Company, the \\"Hispanic Building\\" was a long narrow brick structure with six arches facing Zaragoza Street. Earlier structures at this site served as British and Spanish barracks, a boarding house and, in the 1830s the home of the West Florida Academy. The present building has housed the New Orleans Grocery Company, the Levy-Hallmark Company and the Pensacola-Lurton Company, which leased it to the county for a surplus warehouse. It was acquired by the city in 1968 and is now an integral part of the Historic Pensacola Village. Early Pensacola Industries This is a summary of the museum contents. Timber Pensacola was a thickly wooded area, and the trees provided with lumber and lumber products (e.g., turpentine). Much of the equipment involved in processing timber is displayed on the west end of the building. Brickmaking Pensacola residents produced an amazing number of bricks. Many bricks from Pensacola can be found in the several forts in the area. The museum has a portion of a kiln in the southeast corner. Fishing Fish were plentiful in early Pensacola, and the Museum of Industry houses an old boat from that era. Railroad Pensacola's deepwater port was excellent for transporting goods from sea to land. There is a port downtown to this day, although it is nowhere as busy as it was then.

Its first release was in 1997, originally called Nokia Data Suite. It was replaced by Nokia Suite and integrated into the Ovi service suite. Functionality Nokia PC Suite can be used to transfer music, photos and applications. It can also be used to send Short Message Service (SMS) messages or act as a modem to connect the computer to the Internet. A mobile phone can be connected by USB, Bluetooth, or infrared. Some older Nokia phones lack compatibility with later versions of the PC Suite. The official site supplies a table that matches each phone model with the most recent compatible version. The latest version of Nokia PC Suite also contains several integrated applications, including the File Manager, Application Installer and \\"Nokia Communication Centre\\" data viewer. PC Suite users can also access on-device features (e.g. battery, memory and call handling), as well as Nokia PC Sync functionality. History Some of the earliest devices that worked with Nokia Data Suite were Nokia 3110, Nokia 6110 and Nokia 8110. Nokia PC Suite has been unimproved, and was replaced by Nokia's next generation phone suite software,Nokia Ovi Suite - FAQ Nokia Suite, which supported other platforms in addition to Windows. Nokia Suite drops the Lotus Notes client sync support which is present in Nokia PC Suite, instead requiring the user to use Lotus Notes' Traveler software. This must be installed and maintained on the Lotus Notes server; synchronization using PC Suite works from the phone to the user's PC, while synchronization on a phone which has Nokia Suite must use third party software.  Limitations  The backup feature in PC Suite uses a non-documented binary file format (.nbu), which can only be used to restore to a phone through the proprietary client. This means that the data can only be accessed by doing a restore to a working phone. Third-party programs (either commercial or free) can be used to read the file, but they greatly vary in the amount of information they can retrieve.  Nokia PC Sync  Nokia PC Sync allows the user to synchronize contacts, calendar, notes, to-do items, e-mails, bookmarks and files/folders between a supported Nokia mobile phone and: * Microsoft Outlook 2000-2007 (Outlook 2010 x64 doesn't work with PC Suite at the moment, but its possible to sync via Nokia Suite (tested with 3.1 and E71). Office 2010 x86 does, but is not officially supported. ) * Microsoft Outlook Express / Windows Address Book * Lotus Organizer 5.0-6.0 * Lotus Notes 5.x-8.x * Microsoft Windows Vista Contacts * Microsoft Windows Vista Calendar * Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox bookmarks * Windows 2000/XP files/folders PC Sync 7.0.9.2 contained a major bug, truncating street addresses which have been edited on the PC to run over more than one line, when synchronized back to the phone. It was possible to lose large parts of your contacts' address information due to this issue.  Nokia Maps  Nokia PC Suite is unable to add or update maps and voices for the Nokia Maps application. This requires Nokia Map Loader or Nokia Suite; both require Microsoft Windows with the .NET framework installed. However, it is possible to download maps for Nokia Maps without need for Nokia Map Loader or Nokia Suite by pointing a web browser directly to the map files on Nokia's Maps server.

Born Evelyn Story in Wawanesa, Manitoba, she moved with her family to Vancouver, British Columbia in 1910.  Personal Life  In 1928, Evelyn Story married Sherwood Lett a Canadian soldier, lawyer, diplomat, and jurist. Sherwood and Evelyn Lett had two daughters, Mary and Frances.  Education  Evelyn attended King Edward High School and excelled academically, winning the Governor-General's Gold Medal and a scholarship to the Vancouver branch of McGill University, the precursor to the University of British Columbia. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1917 from the University of British Columbia (UBC), one of the first female graduates. She was also a founding member of the Alma Mater Society and helped give the UBC women the right to vote in 1914 before women could vote in Canada. She received her Master of Arts degree in 1926 from the University of British Columbia, Department of History. Her thesis, India and Nationhood, is one of UBC's First 100 Theses.  Advocacy and Community Work  Evelyn helped establish the Women's Auxiliary of the Salvation Army and chaired the women's section of the United Way. She served on the board of the Vancouver General Hospital and the YWCA, and was a founding member of the Vancouver Art Gallery. Following the Second World War, Evelyn Lett served on government commissions regarding the state of women's employment in Canada, including the Advisory Committee on Reconstruction as one of the members of the Subcommittee on the Post-War Problems of Women. Two women from British Columbia, Evelyn Lett and Grace MacInnis, were members of the subcommittee and they reported that women and their employers in Vancouver-area war plants saw ‚Äúwomen as an integral part of the future economic structure.‚Äù The 1944 report, entitled Post-war Problems of Women: Final Report of the Subcommittee, held that women should be allowed to make a choice to return to the domestic sphere or to continue in paid employment.  Honours  The University of British Columbia (UBC) awarded Evelyn Lett with an honorary Doctor of Law LL.D degree in 1958. Norman MacKenzie, the president of UBC at the time, said that \\"her wide range of public services reflects the humanity, compassion and respect for learning which have made Evelyn Story Lett a woman, a graduate and a citizen whom we are proud and happy to honour.‚Äù In October 1958, she was presented with the Great Trekker Award from UBC. The Great Trekker Award was initiated in 1950 and is presented by the Alma Mater Society to a graduate of UBC who has achieved eminence in his or her chosen field of activity and made a worthy and special contribution to the community. In 1996 the Alma Mater Society created an endowment to provide financial aid for students needing child care. The fund, the largest endowment of its kind at a Canadian university, was named in honour of Lett. She was also given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Alumni Association, which she helped found. In 1997, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for her \\"immense impact on the Vancouver community by raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for a seniors facility and a much-needed daycare centre for the University\\".

Structure Parliament consists of the Queen, represented by the Governor General, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Governor-General summons Parliament, brings its session to an end by prorogation, and formally assents to every bill before it can become law. In practice, she exercises all these powers on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. The passage of legislation depends on the participation of all three component parts of Parliament. A bill must be agreed to by both Houses and receive the Royal Assent before it can become an Act of Parliament. The powers of the Senate and the House of Representatives are constitutionally equal except that financial legislation may not be introduced in the Senate. All Senators are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The House of Representatives is directly elected by the people, and although by tradition the Senate is the Upper House and the House of Representatives is the Lower House, it is the House of Representatives which plays the predominant part in the parliamentary system. The Parliament of Grenada came into being in 1974 when Grenada became an independent country. Functions of the Senate * To act as a house of review with responsibility for expressing second opinion in relation to legislative and other proposals initiated in the House of Representatives; * To ensure proper consideration of all legislation; * To provide adequate scrutiny of financial measures; * To initiate non- financial legislation as the Senate sees fit: the Senate‚Äôs capacity to initiate proposed legislation effectively means that Parliament is not confined in its opportunities for considering public issues in a legislative context to those matters covered by bills brought forward by the executive; * To probe and check the administration of laws and to keep itself informed, and to insist on ministerial accountability for the administration of the Government; * To provide effective scrutiny of Government and enable adequate expression of debate about policy and government programs. As a parliamentary forum, the Senate is one place where a Government can be, of right, questioned and obliged to answer. All bills must be passed by the Senate before they can become law, and it has the constitutional right to reject any bill, and keep on rejecting it as long as it sees fit. It can also amend any bill, although it cannot initiate or increase the amount of any bill dealing with taxation or expenditure. Governor-General The Governor General personifies the State. In law, she is the head of the Executive and an integral part of the legislature. In practice, she exercises all these powers on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. House of Representatives The House of Representatives has 16 members: 15 elected for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies, and a speaker.Electionguide.org The elections are by the first-past-the-post system. The New National Party currently holds every seat in the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives is the focal point of parliamentary activity and public attention, the grand forum of the nation, where major national and international issues are debated; where the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition may be seen in regular confrontation; where Cabinet Ministers defend the policies and conduct of their departments; where the nation‚Äôs business in freely and openly transacted, all that is said and done being faithfully recorded. Parliament makes the laws and the House of Representatives plays the predominant part in making them. Any member can introduce bills, except bills involving expenditure or taxation, which can only be introduced by the government. Since the responsibilities of government now extend into almost every sphere of activity, and since most government action involves spending money (and raising it by taxes, fees, loans, and so forth), most of the time of the House is spent on Government Bills. Every bill must pass both Houses and receive the Royal Assent before it becomes law. Assent is signified by the Governor General. By law a general election must be held at least once every five years. However, Parliament may be dissolved and an election called before the statutory period has elapsed, and this is what normally happens. The power to dissolve Parliament is a royal prerogative exercised by the Governor General, normally on the advice of the Prime Minister. The House of Representatives was modeled on the British, and even now, in any matter of procedure not provided for by its own rules and practices, the rules and practices of the British House of Commons are followed. Senate The Senate has 13 appointed members. 10 are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, with three of them being appointed \\"after he has consulted the organizations or interests which he considers the Senators should be selected to represent,\\" and three are appointed on advice of the Leader of the Opposition. Since the National Democratic Congress does not have any seats in the House of Representatives it was only represented in the Senate with two members up until 2020.

The Lost Ones was published in French in 1970 and translated by the author in 1971. In remarkably dense but spare prose, Beckett describes a small world consisting of a flattened cylinder and its pitiable inhabitants. There is no plot, and Beckett frequently repeats certain phrases and bits of information. He abandoned the story in 1966 because of its \\"intractable complexities\\", and the basic idea was reused in \\"Bing\\" (1966, translated as \\"Ping\\"). Beckett wrote, \\"'Bing' may be regarded as the result or miniaturization of 'Le D√©peupleur'...\\" The story comes from a period where Beckett was implementing the architectural theories of Mies van der Rohe and Adolf Loos, who said that \\"ornament is a crime\\".Gontarski, S.E. Introduction to The Complete Short Prose, 1929-1989. Grove Press, NY. 1995. p. xv. This post-How It Is prose is largely fixated on the interior landscape of the mind. As Beckett noted in the typescript for Watt, \\"the unconscious mind! What a subject for a short story!\\".Gontarski. p. xxiv. Synopsis \\"The Lost Ones\\" is set in an \\"abode where lost bodies roam each searching for its lost one\\". The abode is a flattened cylinder with rubber walls fifty meters in circumference and eighteen meters high. It is constantly illuminated by a dim, yellow light, and the temperature fluctuates between 5¬∞C to 25¬∞C, sometimes in as small an interval as four seconds. This leads to extremely parched skin, and the bodies brush against each other like dry leaves. Kisses make an \\"indescribable sound\\" and the rubber makes the footsteps mostly silent. There are 200 inhabitants, or one per square meter. Some are related to each other. Some are even married to each other, but the conditions make recognition difficult. Spaced throughout the upper half of the cylinder are niches of varying size. Some are self-contained. Others are connected to each other by tunnels. The lost ones can climb into a niche by ladders which are distributed throughout the cylinder. The ladders are often missing rungs at irregular intervals. Most of the lost ones have an irrepressible desire to climb the ladders, and there are large queues around the base of each one, as the lost ones wait their turn to climb. The cylinder has three separate, informal bands of activity. Around the periphery are the climbers waiting for their turns on the ladders. The periphery is also where the sedentary and vanquished lost ones prefer to lean against the wall, uninterested in searching or climbing anymore. As they are underfoot of the climbers, they are viewed as an annoyance. Just in from the outer band is an single-file line of lost ones who are weary of searching in the center of the sphere, where most of the lost ones reside. Sex is an unlikely and rare occurrence due to the difficulties of achieving and maintaining an erection in the climate. When an erection does occur, it penetrates the \\"nearest tube\\". Given basic probability, the likelihood of man and wife uniting in such a way is extremely low. Because of the lack of floor space, no one ever lies down in the cylinder. Adaptations Beckett gave permission to Mabou Mines to stage The Lost Ones through the playwright Jean Reavey, who was a close friend of the author, on the condition that it was only a \\"straight reading\\". During rehearsals, the reading expanded into a fully realized production directed by Lee Breuer with David Warrilow performing the text in a dark, foam rubber cylindrical space with tiny HO scale plastic figures and ladders. The music was composed by Philip Glass. Iris Smith Fischer, Mabou Mines:Making Avant-garde Theater in the 1970s, University of Michigan Press, 2011, p. 113 Beckett later wrote to Reavey, \\"Sounds like a crooked straight reading to me.\\"Gontarski, p. xviii. In 2008, Sarah Kenderdine and Jeffrey Shaw created an art installation based on The Lost Ones, which they called Unmakeablelove. They used motion capture technology to animate the characters in the short story. The audience are able to see the characters only through the use of virtual torches, which interact with the animations creating a mixed reality. Unmakeablelove has been exhibited at Le Volcan in Le Havre, the Shanghai Museum of Science and Technology, and the Hong Kong International Art Fair.

It stands out in San Diego for its tree-lined streets and walkable business district. Predominantly a single-family residence area with some small apartment buildings and bungalow courts, it is noteworthy for its fine and varied collection of Craftsman and Spanish Colonial Revival style homes built between 1905 and 1930. These include works by Irving Gill, William S. Hebbard, and Richard Requa. In 2017 San Diego designated the area of the original South Park Addition subdivision as the South Park Historic District, recognizing it as one of the best examples of an early 20th century streetcar suburb. The neighborhood is home to restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, taverns and wine bars, art galleries, the Albert Einstein Academy Charter School, and other local businesses. It is also home to Pathfinders, one of the oldest residential treatments centers for alcoholism in California. The main roads through South Park, forming its business district, are 30th Street, which was named the nation's best craft beer boulevard by Men's Journal, and Fern St. The neighborhood is dog-friendly and has one of the few designated dog parks adjacent to a residential area in San Diego.http://www.balboapark.org/in-the-park/grape-street-dog-park The South Park neighborhood is part of the Golden Hill Community Planning Area. The San Diego Police Department classifies South Park as a Central Division neighborhood bounded by Balboa Park on the west at 28th Street, Juniper Street on the north, A Street on the south, and Juniper Canyon and SR 15 on the east. It includes zip codes 92102 and 92104.http://www.city- data.com/neighborhood/South-Park-San-Diego-CA.html Heart of South Park at Fern St. and Grape St.  History First registered as a subdivision in 1870, the South Park Addition was too far from Downtown San Diego to attract development until its purchase in 1905 by E. Bartlett Webster. The Bartlett Estate Company put in sidewalks, water, sewer, electricity, and other amenities and began selling lots, positioning the neighborhood as a \\"high-class residential district\\". Further development was spurred by the 1906 opening of the South Park and East Side Railway, an electric streetcar line linking South Park with Downtown San Diego and making South Park the city's first streetcar suburb. In the 1910s, Golden Hill and the area now referred to as South Park became one of the many San Diego neighborhoods connected by the Class 1 streetcars and an extensive San Diego public transit system that was inspired by the Panama- California Exposition of 1915 and built by John D. Spreckels. These streetcars became a fixture of this neighborhood until their retirement in 1949, when the number 2 streetcar was replaced with the number 2 bus.http://www.sdmts.com/MTS/timeline.asphttp://www.chicagorailfan.com/sandate.html Events The Old House Fair is an annual summer community event in South Park, centered on the intersection of 30th Street and Beech Street.

The \\"Father of Black Basketball,\\"http://www.blackpast.org/aah/henderson-edwin-bancroft-1883-1977 introduced basketball to African Americans in Washington, D.C. in 1904, and was Washington's first male African American physical education teacher (and possibly the first in the country). From 1926 until his retirement in 1954, Henderson served as director of health and physical education for Washington D.C.'s black schools. An athlete and team player rather than a star, Henderson both taught physical education to African Americans and organized athletic activities in Washington, D.C. and Fairfax County, Virginia, where his grandmother lived and where he returned with his wife in 1910 to raise their family. A prolific letter writer both to newspapers in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area and Alabama (where he spent many of his last years), Henderson also helped organize the Fairfax County branch of the NAACP and twice served as President of the Virginia NAACP in the 1950s. Early and family life Henderson was born in southwest Washington, D.C. on November 24, 1883. His father, William Henderson, was a day laborer and his mother Louisa taught him to read at an early age. He often reminisced about Al Jolson having been one of his playmates, as well as how he watched racial segregation grow in Washington after the turn of the century, particularly during the Woodrow Wilson administration. His grandmother Eliza Thomas Henderson had a small store in Washington, but in 1882 (the year before his birth) had moved to Falls Church, Virginia and bought a house at 121 S. Washington Street. Henderson became familiar with that area too, spending summers there and sometimes assisting at that store. The family farm, bought about a decade later, had once been part of Camp Alger.Northern Virginia Sun, \\"Local Black Leader Dies,\\" February 3, 1977 Henderson graduated from Dunbar High School, then the Miner Normal School (now known as University of the District of Columbia) in 1904.see note on talk page He earned a bachelor's degree from Howard University, a master's degree from Columbia University, and a Ph.D. in athletic training from Central Chiropractic College in Kansas City, Missouri. Henderson became the first black man to receive a National Honor Fellowship in the American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation. Shortly before his retirement from the D.C. Schools at age 70, Henderson also received an Alumni Achievement Award from his alma mater, Howard University. He married Mary Ellen (Nellie) Meriwether Henderson (1886-1976), also a teacher and civil rights advocate, as well as active with the Girl Scouts and League of Women Voters. They moved to Falls Church, Virginia in 1910 shortly after their marriage, and both helped at the Henderson family store. They lived at 307 South Maple Street (originally 307 W. Fairfax Street) for decades; Edwin Henderson also took the colored streetcar line across the Potomac River to his job with the D.C. Public Schools. They also had a summer home at Highland Beach on Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland. The Hendersons remained married for 63 years until her death (almost a year before his demise), and were survived by both their sons: Dr. James H. M. Henderson (who became director of Tuskegee's Carver Research Foundation), Dr. Edwin M. Henderson (who became a dentist in the District of Columbia).Northern Virginia Sun obituary Career Upon graduating as a teacher in 1904, Henderson taught (and later directed) physical education in the D.C. public schools for five decades. During his first three summer breaks, he attended summer sessions at Harvard University to study medicine or health and physical education. There, Henderson also learned the then-new game of basketball, which he introduced to other young black men at the 12th Street (Colored) YMCA upon returning to Washington, D.C.Mary Ellen Perry, \\"Never Too Old to Dream: NAACP Pioneer Recalls, at 92, the Milestones\\" Washington Star March 26, 1976 p. E-1, E-5 Soon, they were playing teams from Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. His D.C. teams (Howard University adopted the 12th street team as its first varsity basketball team) won the national basketball championships in 1909 and 1910.http://www.blackfives.org/edwin-henderson From those early years through the 1950s, Henderson also played and coached basketball, as well as refereed football and baseball contests and occasionally sparred in the boxing ring. He helped organize the first all-black amateur athletic association, the Interscholastic Athletic Association (1906), the Washington, D.C. Public School Athletic League (1906) and the Eastern Board of Officials (1905) (a training center that, for decades was the go-to pool for highly qualified African American referees). Henderson taught and influenced perhaps hundreds of thousands of Washington area schoolchildren in basketball, including many later luminaries such as Duke Ellington and Charles Drew. From 1926 until 1954, Henderson directed physical education for African American children in the segregated Washington, D.C. school system. He used sports to combat truancy, as well as instill character, forming teams in each fifth and sixth grade classroom. In 1943 his contributions were recognized by his being named to the National Council on Physical Fitness and the subcommittee on colleges and schools of the National Committee on Physical Fitness. Henderson retired shortly after the Brown v. Board of Education decision made segregated schooling obsolete, so the position evaporated, but he was made a fellow of the American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation. During World War II, Henderson helped train Army recruits. In the 1940s, Henderson also advocated for civil rights, including for interracial athletic competitions. Among the battles he fought in the 1940s was picketing the Uline Arena (originally a hockey venue and later called the \\"Washington Coliseum\\"), because the Uline would not allow African Americans and Whites to compete against each other. After hearing the AAU Golden Gloves Boxing competitions were to be held at the Uline, Henderson encouraged picketing until Eugene Meyer, publisher of the Washington Post, withdraw his support for holding the event there. Efforts by Henderson and Meyer ultimately led to the AAU allowing integrated boxing in the District of Columbia. Henderson wrote several seminal books about African American participation in sports, including his landmark work, The Negro In Sports (Washington, DC: Associated Publishers, Inc., 1939). In 1910‚Äì1913, Henderson co-authored an annual handbook published by the Spalding sports company, entitled, Official Handbook of the Interscholastic Athletic Association of Middle Atlantic States, which chronicled the birth of organized sports among African Americans along the Eastern seaboard. This publication, which included photographs of African American teams that competed against each other, was the first of its kind. Henderson also contributed regularly through the National Negro Press Association, including such pioneering magazines as The Messenger and Crisis. In 1963 he collaborated with Sports magazine to publish \\"The Black Athlete--Emergence and Arrival\\" as part of their International Library of Negro Life and History. His last contribution, sponsored by the Phelps-Stokes Fund, was entitled \\"The Black American in Sports\\". Beyond athletics, Henderson and his wife, Nellie Henderson, also an educator, fought against segregation discrimination in housing and education. Five years after they moved to Virginia, in 1915, the Falls Church town council passed an ordinance to create segregated districts within the town. Dr. Henderson, Joseph Tinner and seven other community members, formed the Colored Citizens Protective League, and started a letter writing campaign to address the council and this ordinance. Dr. Henderson and his wife, Mary Ellen, were members of the NAACP, in Washington, D.C., so, they also wrote a letter to W. E. B. Du Bois asking permission to start a NAACP chapter in Falls Church, Virginia. The NAACP headquarters advised that the organization had no rural branches. However, they were given permission to operate as a standing committee under the authority of the NAACP; thus formed the Fairfax County branch in 1918.Historical Marker C-91 at http://dhr.virginia.gov/HistoricMarkers/ Ironically, although the Hendersons won that initial town council ordinance spat, the council then ceded the Seven Corners area back to Fairfax County (because, Henderson said, \\"in those days Negroes were Republican\\"), but decades later unsuccessfully tried to annex it back, afte it had become Fairfax County's largest single source of revenue.H.C. Burchard Jr. \\"Old Warrior Against Segregation Leaving Field at 82\\", Washington Star (undated in Arlingtonlibrary clippings file, possibly November 1965) Dr. Henderson also twice served as President of the NAACP's Virginia Council, from 1955‚Äì1958, the height of Massive Resistance declared by Virginia's political boss (and U.S. Senator) Harry F. Byrd, Sr. after the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education. In addition to the portions of the Stanley Plan that sought to maintain racial segregation in schools (and that were declared unconstitutional by a three-judge federal panel as well as by the Virginia Supreme Court on January 19, 1959), Virginia Governors Thomas B. Stanley and later J. Lindsay Almond Jr. and the Virginia Assembly attempted to harass and dismantle the NAACP in the Commonwealth during Henderson's presidency. E. B. Henderson also wrote many letters to the editor, especially after his retirement, to local newspapers in Washington, D.C. and Virginia. He claimed to have had more than 3,000 letters published in over a dozen newspapers. The majority of the letters concerned race relations and sought equality for African Americans in the United States as well as the local Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Today, the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation and the Washington Post co-sponsor a \\"Dear Editor\\" contest to secondary school aged students in Northern Virginia in his honor. Death and legacy Henderson died of cancer in 1977, at age 93, at his son's home in Tuskegee, Alabama. He survived his beloved wife of 63 years by one year. They were both cremated and their ashes interred in Woodlawn Cemetery (Washington, D.C.). They were survived by their sons, five grandchildren and two great- grandchildren, as well as by his sister, Mrs. Annie H. Briggs of Falls Church, Virginia. His papers are held at Howard University's Moorland-Spingarn Research Center.Washington Star 1976 During his lifetime, Henderson received some recognition, apart from an elaborate sendoff from his Second Baptist Church of Falls Church when he left for Alabama in 1965.Mary Ellen Perry, \\"Never Too Old to Dream\\", Washington Star (March 26, 1976 p.

Burchard Jr, \\"old Warrior Against Segregation Leaving Field at 82\\" Washington Star (undated clipping, probably November 1965) In 1972, Black Sports magazine cited Henderson as \\"one of the foremost black Americans of all time.\\" In 1973, Henderson was elected Honorary President of the North American Society for Sport History. In 1974, along with Joe Louis, Jackie Robinson, Jesse Owens, Bill Russell and Althea Gibson, he became an inaugural member of the Black Athletes Hall of Fame. The honors continued posthumously. In 1982, Fairfax County dedicated its Providence Recreation Center in Edwin Henderson's honor. In 1985, the City of Tuskegee named a park for E.B. Henderson.dedicatory leaflet in Arlington library clippings file In 2002, the City of Falls Church named the Falls Church Community Center gymnasium in his honor. In 2005, the Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School was named after Henderson's wife, because of her multi-years fight to bring equality to educational facilities in Fairfax County Public Schools and in Virginia. In 1999, the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation erected a pink granite (trondhjemite) archway memorializing the founders of the Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL) which eventually became the NAACP's first rural branch. Since 1993, the Annual Tinner Blues Festival has taken place on the second Saturday of June in Falls Church's Cherry Hill Park. Many national and area blues musicians play at the event, which also recognizes the late Piedmont Blues guitarist/singer John Jackson, who made his home in Northern Virginia. In 2013, Henderson was inducted posthumously into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2018, the Library of Virginia honored Henderson as one of its Strong Men and Women.http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/smw/2018/ References Further reading *James H.N. Henderson and Betty F.

The plot concerns an astronaut whose body begins to melt after he is exposed to radiation during a space flight to Saturn, driving him to commit murders and consume human flesh to survive. During post-production, the producers reshot scenes without Sachs' participation. The film starred Alex Rebar as the main character, alongside Burr DeBenning as a scientist trying to help him and Myron Healey as a United States Air Force general seeking to capture him. While writing and shooting, Sachs was influenced by Night of the Living Dead. With the changes by the producers, the final film has been described as a remake of First Man into Space (1959), which in turn was directly influenced by The Quatermass Xperiment,Hamilton, 2013, pp. 39--41. even though Sachs had never seen either of those films.William Sachs: Audio Commentary and interview on Blu-Ray- edition of \\"The Incredible Melting Man\\" by Arrow Video. The screenplay which Sachs dramatized was originally intended as a parody of horror films, but comedic scenes were edited out during production and new horror scenes added. Sachs claimed that the producers decided during shooting that a straight horror film would be more financially successful, and that the film suffered as a result. The Incredible Melting Man was produced by American International Pictures, which also handled the theatrical distribution. The film includes several homages to science fiction and horror films of the 1950s. Makeup artist Rick Baker provided the gory makeup effects for the film. He originally created four distinct stages of makeup design so that the main character's body would appear to melt gradually, but the stages were ultimately cut from the final film. The film was commercially successful, but it received largely negative reviews, although even critical reviews complimented Baker's makeup effects. According to writer/director Sachs, many scenes that were re-shot and changed by the producers proved problematic due to their inferior acting. The Incredible Melting Man was featured in the comedy It Came from Hollywood (1982) and inspired the makeup effects for a scene in the science fiction- action film RoboCop (1987). It was also featured in a season 7 episode of the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000. Plot During a space flight to Saturn, three astronauts are exposed to a blast of radiation which kills two of them and seriously injures the third, Colonel Steve West (Alex Rebar). He is next shown unconscious in a hospital back on Earth, with bandages covering his face; his physician, Dr. Loring (Lisle Wilson), cannot explain what is happening to West or how he survived the blast. After the doctor leaves, West awakens and is horrified to find the flesh on his face and hands melting away. Hysterical, he attacks and kills a nurse (Bonnie Inch), then escapes the hospital in a panic. Loring and Dr. Theodore \\"Ted\\" Nelson (Burr DeBenning), a scientist and friend of West, discover that the nurse's corpse is emitting feeble radiation, and realize West's body has become radioactive. Nelson believes West has gone insane, and concludes he must consume human flesh in order to slow the melting. Nelson calls General Michael Perry (Myron Healey), a United States Air Force officer familiar with West's accident, and the general agrees to help Nelson find him. West attacks and kills a fisherman (Samuel W. Gelfman) in a wood, then encounters and frightens a little girl Carol (Julie Drazen) there, but she escapes unharmed. Nelson tracks West by following his radiation trail with a geiger counter, but only finds his detached ear stuck to a tree branch. Perry arrives by plane, and is picked up by Nelson; shortly thereafter, they visit the crime scene where the fisherman's body was found. Sheriff Neil Blake (Michael Alldredge) suspects that Nelson knows something, but Nelson tells the sheriff nothing because Perry had earlier informed him that any information about West was classified. Later that night, Nelson returns home to his pregnant wife Judy (Ann Sweeny), who tells him that her elderly mother Helen (Dorothy Love) and Helen's boyfriend Harold (Edwin Max) are coming over for dinner. On their way, however, Helen and Harold are attacked in their car by West, and he kills them both. When Blake finds the bodies, he calls Nelson, who comes out to identify them. After Blake angrily demands an explanation, Nelson reluctantly reveals West's condition. Nelson believes West is somehow getting stronger the more his body decomposes. Back at Nelson's house, West attacks and kills Perry, although Judy is not harmed. Nelson and Blake arrive just as West escapes. West then stumbles upon the home of a married couple (played by Jonathan Demme and Janus Blythe). West kills the man and attacks his wife, but she drives him away after chopping his arm off with a cleaver. Blake receives a call about the attack and takes Nelson with him to investigate. They follow West to a giant power plant, and then up several flights of outside stairways. Blake tries to shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts do not stop West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the railing, leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, reminding him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards (Mickey Lolich and Westbrook Claridge) then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face as he tries to protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing against the side of a building, he slowly, and completely, melts away. The next morning, a janitor (DeForest Covan) finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn. Cast Production Writing The Incredible Melting Man was written and directed by filmmaker William Sachs. The idea for the film came to him when his mother, working in the office of a spray paint company, showed him \\"gooey stuff\\" which was used as a basis for spray paint and jokingly suggested that he should do a film featuring that material. During writing, Sachs was influenced by The Night of the Living Dead and wanted to give the film a 1950s horror film feeling. But the final film, with its structure changed by the producers in post-production, has been described by some sources ‚Äì including the film magazine Cinefantastique and the 1995 book Cult Science Fiction Films ‚Äì as a remake of First Man into Space (1959), another film about an astronaut who becomes a monster after an accident in space. Science fiction film historian Gene Wright suggested that the final film was heavily influenced by The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), a British horror film about an astronaut who begins mutating into an alien organism after a spaceflight. Sachs, however, had never seen either of those films, and his original screenplay had a very different structure. He had originally written the script for The Incredible Melting Man as a parody of horror films. According to Michael Adams, a film reviewer who interviewed Sachs, this was the reason that the film mixed horror with comedic moments, such as when Steve West's detached ear gets stuck on a tree, and when a janitor sweeps West's melted body into a garbage can at the end of the film. Adams claims that this explains several comedic lines of dialogue otherwise inconsistent with the rest of the film, including one moment when homeless men notice the melting West and say to each other, \\"You think we've got trouble, look at that dude\\". In Sachs' original version, the film opened with the wide-angle shot of the nurse running through the hallway; this would not have been in slow motion, unlike the final film, where the producers played it back slowed down. Only later would viewers have gradually learned the background of the melting man. All the scenes showing the astronauts in space and the lead character in the hospital were re-shot during post-production without influence by the director, and Sachs criticized both the acting in those scenes and how they restructure the film. There are logical problems in the final film due to the re-shot scenes; it is never fully explained how West's spacecraft returned to Earth from Saturn when West himself was so seriously injured and the other two members of his crew were both killed. Welch D. Everman, author of Cult Science Fiction Films, pointed to several homages in the movie to science fiction and horror films of the 1950s. The title itself is a reference to the Jack Arnold film The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957), and the final scene when a radio report advertises another trip to Saturn, thus hinting that another accident could occur, was a common device in 1950s horror films. One difference, noted by Everman, is that in the 1950s films, government cover-ups and secret agendas were often ascribed to the good of the general public, whereas The Incredible Melting Man, like many late 1970s films of its genre, suggested otherwise. Variety described the script, in addition to its horror elements, as \\"a human story attempting to leave a moral message as to whether society or the horrible creature it is chasing is really the most destructive\\". Casting Alex Rebar, in one of only a handful of film appearances throughout his acting career, starred as Steve West. Burr DeBenning played Dr. Ted Nelson, and General Michael Perry was portrayed by Myron Healey, who was, Everman notes, often cast as a villain in 1950s science fiction films. Film director Jonathan Demme played the small role of Matt Winters, one of West's victims. Rainbeaux Smith, best known for her appearances in B movies and exploitation films, appeared in The Incredible Melting Man as a model who finds one of West's victims while trying to avoid a photographer seeking to take explicit photos of her. Filming Producer Max Rosenberg, best known for his horror and supernatural films, provided the financing for The Incredible Melting Man. Samuel W. Gelfman was the film's producer, and American International Pictures served as both the production company and the distributor. According to Sachs, Gelfman and Rosenberg decided during shooting that a straight horror film would be more financially successful than a parody, so many of the comedic scenes were edited out and new horror scenes were shot and added to the film. Sachs said he felt the film was taken away from him, and that it suffered as a result because the producers tried to make it both a comedy and horror film, thus failing at both. Sachs said of the decision, \\"How can a serious horror movie end with the monster being shoveled into a garbage can?\\" Makeup effects artist Rick Baker designed facial appliances that simulated the deterioration of the main character. Makeup artist Baker provided the special makeup effects for The Incredible Melting Man, which included the gradual melting of Steve West. Rebar wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, and his hands and feet were fitted with liquid substances that dropped off as he walked, creating the appearance that West's body was falling apart. During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact. Baker created four distinct stages of makeup design so that West would appear to melt gradually as time passed. However, after the film went through two separate stages of editing, these makeup stages were ultimately eliminated from the final cut, and the character looks generally the same throughout the film. Richard Meyers, author of The World of Fantasy Films, said actor Rebar was impatient and uncooperative with the extensive makeup sessions required for the effects, and thus did not wear all of the facial appliances Baker designed. This, Meyers said, might have been an additional factor in the lack of makeup effect stages in the final film. The version of the film shot by Sachs had not included any scenes with West before he sustained the radiation poisoning that caused his body to melt. Such scenes were, however, re-shot later by the producers without Sachs' participation. Harry Woolman worked on the special effects along with Baker, and Willy Curtis worked as the film's cinematographer. Some scenes included photography errors, including one in which light shines through a kitchen window from outside even though it is supposed to be nighttime. Michel Levesque provided art direction, and the musical score was composed by London Philharmonic Orchestra conductor Arlon Ober. During post-production, as the producers decided to change the film into a more serious horror film, they filmed numerous scenes for that purpose without the participation of the director. Among those scenes is the entire prologue of the astronauts in space and West waking up in a hospital‚Äîthese are the only scenes in which Rebar's face is seen without makeup. Additionally, the film was extensively re-edited by the producers. Sachs criticized the acting in those re-shot scenes, as well as the change of tone they bring into the film along with the re-editing by the producers. Release Distribution The distribution of The Incredible Melting Man was handled by American International Pictures, with the involvement of film producer and distributor Irwin Yablans, who specialized primarily in B movies and low- budget horror films. A trailer released for the film attempted to build tension by not revealing the monster right away. Instead, it showed portions of the scene immediately before the nurse is murdered, in which she runs down a hallway screaming and then crashes through a glass window trying to escape from West, who is only shown towards the end of the trailer. In some advertisements, the monster from the film was described as \\"the first NEW horror creature\\". As a promotional gimmick, candles were made and sold to advertise the film. One poster for the film included the statement: \\"Rick Baker, the new master of special effects, who brought you the magic of The Exorcist and gave you the wonder of King Kong, now brings you his greatest creation, The Incredible Melting Man\\". Although Baker assisted with the effects in The Exorcist (1973), Dick Smith was the makeup artist who primarily worked on that film, not Baker. Exorcist director William Friedkin was so angry about the poster that, upon seeing it on an associate's wall, he tore it down and ripped it to pieces. Baker, who did not know about the poster in advance, was horrified by the publicity campaign and publicly apologized for it, claiming: \\"Dick wanted some help so I first went out to do some work on the dummy whose head turns around 360 degrees. I really didn't do anything creative, I just did labor\\". Reception The Incredible Melting Man received largely negative reviews. It holds an 8% rotten rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. It has ranked among the Bottom 100 list of films on the Internet Movie Database, although there have also been very favorable reviews.. The New York Post attested to Sachs' \\"simple mastery of the medium\\".. Tom Buckley of The New York Times described it as poorly written and directed, calling it one of many poor summer films released \\"to fill the need of drive-in operators for something cheap to put on the screen for the kids in the cars to ignore or laugh at\\". The Globe and Mail writer Robert Martin praised Baker's makeup effects and said director Sachs did an efficient job building tension. However, Martin strongly criticized the script and the acting, claiming \\"logic and character are jettisoned in favor of suspense and horror,\\" and said the film's positive elements were not strong enough to outweigh the negatives. John Foyston of The Oregonian strongly condemned the film as gratuitously gory with thin, motiveless characters. He declared it worse than the horror film Manos: The Hands of Fate (1966), which is widely considered one of the worst films ever made. Rick Worland, a film professor at the Meadows School of the Arts who wrote a book about horror films, said there was \\"little to recommend\\" about The Incredible Melting Man besides Baker's makeup effects. Richard Meyers, a novelist who also wrote about science- fiction films, called the film muddled and dull: \\"Although the movie didn't have to be a sage examination of outer space diseases, it should at least have been exciting\\". Meyers complimented Baker's visual effects, but said his work was undermined by poor filming and actor Rebar's impatience with the makeup effects. A 1985 review in the book The Motion Picture Guide said, \\"The film tries to balance horror against morality but ends up shaky at best\\". The review described the special effects as \\"all right, but not nearly as gruesome as the film pretends they are\\". In a review written shortly after the film was released, Variety wrote that the film \\"more often than not succeeds in telling a story and sustaining audience interest,\\" and that the script included not only horrors, but also a human story with a moral message about society. However, the review also called the dialogue \\"trite,\\" described some scenes as \\"technically incorrect,\\" and said the film disappointed by lingering on the ordinary characters rather than on the monster. Gene Wright, who wrote a book about science fiction films, said the film \\"attempts to blend pathos with awesome horror, but can't resist going for the gut with a surfeit of gore\\". Blockbuster Inc.'s Guide to Movies and Videos gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and described the it as \\"unexciting and contrived, though Rick Baker's gross-out makeup is undeniably effective\\". In The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies, Phil Hardy described it as a better-than-average but \\"spotty\\" film, and said director William Sachs injected a sense of \\"grisly humor\\" into it. However, Hardy said the central concept inspired more laughter than terror, and called the special effects \\"only routine\\". Some reviews were more positive. Welch D. Everman, author of Cult Science Fiction Films, compared the relationship between West and Nelson to that of Victor Frankenstein and his monster in Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. Everman wrote, \\"This is the kind of movie we've come to expect from AIP ‚Äî cheaply made, nasty, and lots of fun\\". John W. Bowen of the Belleville Intelligencer said he enjoyed the \\"camp\\" style of the film, adding, \\"It's both inexplicable and sad this brain-damaged yet fiercely determined little drive-in bottom feeder never garnered more than a tiny cult following over the years\\". A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, \\"Films like The Incredible Melting Man are not made to be good; they are made to be scary. For anyone looking to raise goosebumps on their flesh, this one is sufficient to give you your money's worth\\". Matt Maiellaro, co-creator of the Cartoon Network series Aqua Teen Hunger Force, said the film inspired him to start making films himself, adding, \\"When I was eight, I watched The Incredible Melting Man and knew that horror movies were going to be big religion in my life\\". Z movie director Tim Ritter said he was partially inspired to enter show business by watching a trailer for The Incredible Melting Man at age 9. Ritter said, \\"I was too young to see the movie, but the trailer really got into my imagination\\". Home release The Incredible Melting Man was released on VHS in 1986 by Vestron Video, and was rereleased in 1994 by Orion Pictures Library, although unlike other Orion VHS releases, it was not digitally remastered. In September 2000, The Incredible Melting Man was once again released on VHS as part of \\"Midnite Movies\\", a line of B movies and exploitation films released to home video by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Although currently unavailable on DVD in Region 1, it was released in Region 2 by CMV Laservision on February 2, 2003. In addition to the home video and DVD releases, The Incredible Melting Man has been featured in several film festivals, including the 1987 Visions Film Festival at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney, Australia; the 2007 B-Fest in Chicago; the 2008 Horrorama Movie Festival in Englewood, Colorado; and the 2010 Groovy B-Movie Marathon in Durham, North Carolina. Scream Factory released the film on Blu-ray in 2013. Legacy The makeup effects in a scene from RoboCop (1987), where a man melts after getting covered in toxic waste, were inspired by Rick Baker's effects in The Incredible Melting Man. The film appeared in It Came from Hollywood, a 1982 comedy film featuring a compilation of clips from more than 100 B movies from the 1930s to the 1970s, which are shown between scripted segments performed by comedians. Baker's effects from The Incredible Melting Man inspired the makeup effects for a scene in the science fiction-action film RoboCop (1987). During the scene, Emil Antonowsky (Paul McCrane) attempts to ram RoboCop with his van, but instead accidentally drives into a vat of toxic waste, causing the flesh to melt off his face and hands. These effects were conceived and designed by special makeup effects artist Rob Bottin, who was inspired by Baker's work on The Incredible Melting Man and dubbed the RoboCop effects \\"the Melting Man\\" as a homage to the production. The Incredible Melting Man was featured and lampooned in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The film appeared in the fourth episode of the show's seventh season, which was broadcast on Comedy Central on February 24, 1996. Michael J. Nelson, the show's head writer, spoke disparagingly about the film while describing it to the press: \\"The plot is ‚Äì and I'm not kidding here ‚Äì the plot is, a guy is melting. That's the plot\\".

It is located on the Chester Road in Castle Vale, Birmingham, England and employs 3,200 people. The plant covers an area of 110 acres (44.5 hectares), with a 60,000 m¬≤ (6-hectare) manufacturing facility.https://cundall.com/Projects/Jaguar-Land-Rover.aspx It manufactures all Jaguar saloon and sports cars. The site was first developed as Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory, a shadow factory for the production of aircraft by the car industry as part of the rearmament of the UK in the pre-Second World war era. After initial problems it was brought under the control of aircraft manufacturers and became one of the largest producers of aircraft during the war. History Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory Nuffield: 1936‚Äì1940 In 1936, the British government had formalised a plan under the Air Ministry called the Shadow factory plan to increase capacity within Britain's aircraft industry. Headed up by Herbert Austin, the plan was to create nine new factories and add additional capacity and facilities to Britain's existing car manufacturing plants to enable them to quickly turn to aircraft production should the political situation in Europe change towards war. In 1936, the Air Ministry purchased a parcel of land opposite Castle Bromwich Aerodrome which encompassed an old sewage works. Developed and managed by the Nuffield Organisation, owners of Morris Motors, they were briefed to manufacture Supermarine Spitfire fighters and later Avro Lancaster bombers. The theory was that the local Birmingham skills-base and production techniques used in the manufacture of motor vehicles could be transferred to aircraft production. CBAF ordered the most modern machine tools then available which were being installed two months after work started on the site.Price 1982, p. 67. Although Morris Motors under Lord Nuffield (an expert in mass motor-vehicle construction) managed and equipped the factory, it was funded by government money. When the project was first mooted, it was estimated that the factory would be built for ¬£2,000,000, however, by the beginning of 1939, this cost had doubled to over ¬£4,000,000.McKinstry 2007, p. 145. The Spitfire's stressed-skin construction required precision engineering skills and techniques outside the experience of the local labour force which took some time to train. Aircraft and sub-assemblies were taken across the Chester Road to Castle Bromwich Aerodrome; though early plans included an aerial bridge from E block to the airfield. Very large hangar-like buildings were erected on the east side of the airfield, which were originally referred to as 'Erecting Sheds', where aircraft were prepared for flight testing. They were for the most part referred to by personnel as the 'Flight Sheds'. CBAF's chief test pilot was Alex Henshaw MBE who managed a team of pilots who had the job of flight-testing the aircraft. The Air Transport Auxiliary were responsible for dispersing tested machines to the Maintenance Units around the country for the fitting of radio-telephones and other equipment. As any build-up of machines on the airfield would be vulnerable to aerial attack, testing was carried out during daylight in almost any weather. This Spitfire Mk IIA, now owned by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, was built at Castle Bromwich CBAF produced all versions of the Spitfire from the Mk II onwards. This aircraft had the more powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin XII engine, providing , an increase of over the Mk I, and could be used with either the de Havilland or Rotol propellers. The first Mk II flew on 24 September 1939. However, even as the first Spitfires were being built in June 1940, the factory was still incomplete and there were numerous problems with the factory management which ignored tooling and drawings provided by Supermarine in favour of tools and drawings of its own designs.McKinstry 2007, p. 152. Meanwhile, the workforce, while not completely stopping production, continually threatened strikes or \\"slow downs\\" until their demands for higher than average pay rates were met.McKinstry 2007, pp. 152, 153. By May 1940, Castle Bromwich had not yet built its first Spitfire in spite of promises that the factory would be producing 60 per week starting in April. It is worth noting, however, that key players, such as Alex Henshaw, viewed the problems as primarily those of poor management during the initial phase. Workers worked twelve-hour on and twelve-hours off until bombings forced a switch to a three-shift, eight-hour system. Henshaw attended the diamond jubilee in 1996 of the founding of the CBAF, hosted by Jaguar Cars Limited in the old factory and remained fulsome in his praise for the workforce until his death. Vickers-Armstrong: 1940‚Äì1945 After the fall of the government of Neville Chamberlain, new Prime Minister Winston Churchill appointed press tycoon Lord Beaverbrook as the Minister of Aircraft Production. On 17 May, Beaverbrook telephoned Nuffield and manoeuvered him into handing over control of the Castle Bromwich plant to Beaverbook's Ministry.Price 1982, p. 107. Nuffield was furious and reported the incident to Churchill, but Beaverbrook countered by sending in aircraft expert Sir Richard Fairey who wrote a secret report which detailed how expensive machinery had been unused, the assembly line in chaos, and the employees not doing their work: Beaverbrook, who had disturbed the Air Ministry by agreeing with the vision of Air Vice Marshal Hugh Dowding that Britain at that time needed defensive fighters over attacking bombers, immediately cancelled all Castle Bromwich contracted bombers, which at that point included the Handley-Page Halifax and the Vickers Wellington.http://www.battleofbritain1940.net/document-42.html He then sent in experienced management staff and workers from Supermarine, and gave over control of the factory to Vickers-Armstrong (Supermarine's parent company). Although it would take some time to resolve the problems, CBAF achieved full production in June 1940, when 10 Spitfire Mk IIs were built;Castle Bromwich Retrieved: 9 February 2008. 23 in July; 37 in August; and 56 in September.Price 1982, p. 109. No. 611 Squadron at RAF Digby the first squadron to receive the Mk II in August 1940, notably late in the Battle of Britain. The wisdom of the shadow factory scheme was demonstrated in September 1940, when the Supermarine factory in Southampton was bombed, and production there temporarily stopped. CBAF went on to become the largest and most successful plant of its type during the 1939‚Äì45 conflict. As the largest Spitfire factory in the UK, by producing a maximum of 320 aircraft per month, it built over half of the approximately 20,000 aircraft of this type. By the time production ended at Castle Bromwich in June 1945, a total of 12,129 Spitfires (921 Mk IIs,Air International 1985, p. 187. 4,489 Mk Vs, 5,665 Mk IXs,Delve 2007, p. 79. and 1,054 Mk XVIs) had been built. Subsequently receiving an order for 200 production aircraft, the first CBAF Lancaster was flown on 22 October 1943 by Alex Henshaw. Given the airframe number HK535 and fitted with Merlin 22 engines, it was issued to No. 463 Squadron Royal Australian Air Force. It was lost on a raid over Lille, France during the night of 10/11 May 1944. Production of Lancasters reached a peak of 25 in December 1944, a record for the quantity produced anywhere. Some original war time features can still be seen such today, such as the faded remains of green camouflage paint. This can still be seen on the top of some older production buildings such as F Block that is now used as trim and final assembly for the Jaguar XJ. Close inspection will also reveal that all the cast-iron hoppers of the factory's rainware have a winged-roundel motif cast into them. At the Jubilee celebrations in 1997, a plaque was unveiled by Alex Henshaw just inside the old wartime main gates to the factory site. At the moment of the unveiling, ex-Red Arrows founder Ray Hanna made a single pass over the ceremony in Spitfire MkIX, MH434. This machine was not only built at the CBAF, but was test-flown by Henshaw himself. The a/c had been specially named for the occasion by Henshaw at Elmdon Airfield (Now known as Birmingham International.). After the unveiling, both Henshaw and Hanna attended a celebratory luncheon with many local dignitaries as well as many former CBAF employees. The whole event was supported and funded by Jaguar Cars Ltd. 1945‚Äì1977 The first post war owners were Fisher and Ludlow, themselves having been bombed out of their inner city factory. Fisher & Ludlow (later Pressed Steel Fisher) were a car body pressings sub-contractor for most of the (now-defunct) British Motor Corporation and later British Leyland marques, the last being Jaguar, who took over outright control of the factory in 1977. Jaguar Cars: 1977 to present Sentinel sculpture on nearby roundabout Taken over by Jaguar Cars, the facility transferred to Ford on their takeover, and then to Tata Motors as part of Jaguar Land Rover. Soon after takeover, Tata Motors announced it would close either the Castle Bromwich Assembly plant or Land Rover's Lode Lane plant in Solihull. In March 2010 it was reported that Tata Motors might reconsider plant closures, but on 19 April 2010 Tata Motors announced it would go ahead and close one factory. On 15 October 2010 it was announced that an agreement had been made between Jaguar Land Rover management and union bosses to save all three Jaguar Land Rover production plants from closure. Jaguar Land Rover have agreed that all plants will remain open until at least 2020 in a deal with the Unite the Union, which represents the majority of salaried production employees. Although the deal has yet to be voted on by union members it is expected to be accepted. In mid June 2019, workers at the plant had voted to move to a four-day week amid a ¬£2.5bn cost- cutting drive. The offer by the employees was intended to help \\"attract new models and increase job security\\" since manufacturing of the XJ was to end in July. Weeks later, on 5 July 2019, JLR announced its intention to build a new electric XJ saloon, replacing the manufacturing of the conventional Jaguar XJ (X351) at Castle Bromwich, \\"safeguarding the jobs of 2,500 people\\" (or 2,700 people, according to BBC News). Manufacturing of the new model was expected to start in autumn 2019, after an investment of ¬£1 billion in upgrades to the facility. A BBC report indicated that the plant \\"also produces the Jaguar XF, XE and F-Type\\" as of mid-2019, but the XJ was essential for the continuation of the manufacturing facility. Without the new electric model, the Castle Bromwich plant would \\"effectively be dead\\", according to David Bailey, a professor of business economics at Birmingham Business School. Products Made The facility currently handles body stamping operations, body assembly, paint and trim, and final assembly for all Jaguar saloon and sports cars. Over 3000 workers currently work at the site producing thousands of cars for the UK and export markets. *Jaguar XE *Jaguar XF *Jaguar F-Type Product history The following models were built at the Castle Bromwich plant until end of production. *Jaguar XK *Jaguar XJ *Jaguar S-Type References External links Category:British shadow factories Category:Jaguar Land Rover Category:Buildings and structures in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Motor vehicle assembly plants in the United Kingdom Category:Manufacturing plants in England ","title":"Castle Bromwich Assembly"},{"id":"4501636","text":"Prior to 1975, Elte was, with approximately 1,300 residents, a self-standing, political community under the authorities of Rheine.

Early life McElwaine was the oldest of eight children and was born and grew up in the townland of Knockacullion, beside the hamlet and townland of Knockatallon, near the village of Scotstown in the north of County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland. McElwaine took his first steps towards becoming involved in physical force republicanism when he joined Na Fianna √âireann aged 14. At the age of 16, McElwaine turned down an opportunity to study in the United States and joined the IRA, stating \\"no one will ever be able to accuse me of running away\\". Paramilitary activities Gravestone of S√©amus McElwaine McElwaine was an active member of the IRA, who became Officer Commanding of the IRA in County Fermanagh by the age of 19. On 5 February 1980, McElwaine killed off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) corporal Aubrey Abercrombie as he drove a tractor in the townland of Drumacabranagher, near Florencecourt. Later that year, on 23 September, McElwaine killed off-duty Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Reserve Constable Ernest Johnston outside his home in Roslea. He was suspected of involvement in at least 10 other killings. On 14 March 1981, a detachment of the British Army surrounded a farmhouse near Roslea, containing McElwaine and three other IRA members. Despite being armed with four rifles, including an Armalite, the IRA members surrendered and were arrested. While on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol McElwaine stood in the February 1982 Irish general election as an independent candidate for Cavan‚ÄìMonaghan and received 3,974 votes (6.84% of the vote). In May 1982 McElwaine was convicted of murdering the RUC and UDR members, with the judge describing him as a \\"dangerous killer\\" and recommending he spend at least 30 years in prison. On 25 September 1983, McElwaine was involved in the Maze Prison escape, the largest break-out of prisoners in Europe since World War II and in British prison history. 38 republican prisoners, armed with 6 handguns, hijacked a prison meals lorry and smashed their way out of the Maze prison. After the escape he joined an IRA active service unit operating in the area of the border between Counties Monaghan and Fermanagh. The unit targeted police and military patrols with gun and bomb attacks, while sleeping rough in barns and outhouses to avoid capture. He held a meeting with P√°draig McKearney and Jim Lynagh, members of the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade, in which they discussed forming a flying column aimed at destroying police stations to create IRA controlled zones within Northern Ireland. However, this plan never materialised. McKearney and Lynagh were later themselves killed in the Loughgall Ambush.Moloney, pp. 312‚Äì15. Death Monument in Corlat erected in memory of S√©amus McElwaine On 26 April 1986, McElwaine and another IRA member, Sean Lynch, were preparing to ambush a British Army patrol near Roslea, County Fermanagh when they were ambushed themselves by a detachment from the Special Air Service Regiment. Both were wounded; Lynch managed to escape while McElwaine was questioned then shot dead while incapacitated. McElwaine was buried in Scotstown, his funeral was attended by an estimated 3,000 people, including Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness; the latter gave an oration describing McElwaine as \\"a brave intelligent soldier, a young man who gave up his youth to fight for the freedom of his country\\" and \\"an Irish freedom fighter murdered by British terrorists\\". In 1987 McElwaine's father, Jimmy, a longtime member of Monaghan County Council, became the chairman of the S√©amus McElwain Cumann of Republican Sinn F√©in. On 1 April 1990 a monument to McElwaine was erected in Corlat, County Monaghan. The oration was given by a Catholic priest, Father Piaras √ì D√∫ill, who compared McElwaine to Nelson Mandela, saying they both had the same attitude to oppression and both refused to denounce principle. The inscription on the monument is a quote from Patrick Pearse; \\"As long as Ireland is unfree the only honourable attitude for Irishmen and Irishwomen is an attitude of revolt\\". A monument to McElwaine and six other republicans was erected in Roslea in 1998, and unveiled by veteran republican Joe Cahill. In January 1993 an inquest jury returned a verdict that McElwaine had been unlawfully killed. The jury ruled the soldiers had opened fire without giving him a chance to surrender, and that he was shot dead five minutes after being wounded. The Director of Public Prosecutions requested a full report on the inquest from the RUC, but no one has been prosecuted for McElwaine's death. In April 2006 approximately 1,000 people in Roslea paid tribute to McElwaine during the traditional Easter Commemoration to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising. Victims groups and unionist politicians, including Democratic Unionist Party member Arlene Foster, had asked the Parades Commission to ban the parade from the area where McElwaine was killed, describing him as an \\"evil murderer\\", but the Commission ruled the commemoration could proceed without any restriction. In Corlat, two weeks later, some 500 people attended the launch of a documentary film about McElwaine, Life and death of an IRA activist, marking the 20th anniversary of his death.

History The area of today's Neuhaus belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, established in 1180. In 1371 Prince-Archbishop Albert II's bailiff in V√∂rde erected the fortress Slikborch near today's Neuhaus at the mouth of the river Aue into the Oste, shortly before it empties into the Elbe, as a stronghold to wield power over the Land of Kehdingen and to gain a stake in the neighbouring Saxe- Lauenburgian exclave Land of Hadeln. In 1387 the free peasants from Hadeln and Kehdingen demolished the fortress Slikborch as a threat to their autonomy.Adolf Hofmeister, \\"Der werdende Territorialstaat der Erzbisch√∂fe von Bremen (1236‚Äì1511): II.

In 1404 Prince-Archbishop Otto II erected a new fortress on the right bank of the Aue, then named \\"dat Nygehus\\" (the new house), becoming the eponym for the place. However, the peasants again also destroyed this fortress in 1420. The peasants of the neighbouring municipalities forged an alliance against a new fortress in 1423. In 1435 Prince-Archbishop Baldwin II commissioned the construction of a new fortress now called castle or mansion, although his pre-predecessor had pledged not to erect another fortress. Peasants of Hadeln, Kehdingen, and Wursten attacked the fortress several times in the 15th and 16th century. Under Prince- Archbishop Christopher the Spendthrift a number of villages tried to separate from the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen in favour of neighbouring Saxe- Lauenburgian Hadeln. This resulted in a war between Christopher and Duke Magnus I of Saxe-Lauenburg. However, Christopher successfully suppressed the separatists and Magnus and Christopher confirmed the status quo ante bellum of the villages by a treaty in 1516. Duke Magnus, however, broke the contract and ravaged villages in the prince-archbishopric, including the fortress in Neuhaus. The castle was soon restored but around 1540 Christopher the Spendthrift pawned it with all its dues to levy to Johann von M√ºnchhausen for 4,000 gold guilders. In 1544 the estates of the prince-archbishopric agreed to levy an extra tax to redeem the pawns in return for Christopher's moderation of his prodigality. On 9 June 1547 Count Albrecht von Mansfeld, commander of the Protestant forces in the Smalkaldic War, captured the fortress. By this time the inhabitants adopted Lutheranism, also as a form of opposition against the spendthrift Prince-Archbishop Christopher, who broke contracts with the estates of the prince-archbishopric and acted against its constitution. However, in 1548 prince-archiepiscopal troops reconquered the castle, which now served as an important outpost of the ruler. A bailiff (first in , then Amtmann and at last Drost) represented the prince-archbishop in Neuhaus and its environs, including the parishes of Belum, B√ºlkau, Cadenberge, Geversdorf, Kehdingbruch (a part of today's Belum), Oberndorf, and Oppeln (a part of today's Wingst). During the Leaguist occupation under Tilly (1628‚Äì1630) in the course of the Thirty Years' War, the inhabitants of Neuhaus suffered from attempts of re-Catholicisation. The war ended by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, by which the ecclesiastical Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the secular Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish crown ‚Äì interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712‚Äì1715) ‚Äì and from 1715 on by the House of Hanover. In the 18th century the fortress finally fell into decay and was torn down. Today its former site is indicated by a hill, now covered by the Schlosspark (castle park) with a war memorial. In 1807 the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the duchy, before France annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the duchy was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which ‚Äì after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 ‚Äì incorporated the duchy in a real union and the ducal territory, including Neuhaus, became part of the Hanoveran Stade Region, established in 1823.

History 1963‚Äì2001 Halewood was originally opened by Ford Motor Company on 2 October 1963, to build the then small-saloon Ford Anglia. Reflecting pressure on Ford of Britain's principal plant at Dagenham, the Halewood plant was also used for assembling the Ford Corsair between the model's 1964 launch and 1969. More recently the Halewood plant has been associated with the Ford Escort - which replaced the Anglia in 1967. The Capri was also assembled at Halewood from its introduction in 1969. The introduction of the Fiesta in 1976 saw Ford of Europe restructure its entire European operations: all Capri production was moved to the Cologne plant in Germany, whilst Halewood was developed to become (until 1998 along with Saarlouis) Ford's main European production facility for the Escort and derivative Ford Orion models. The Escort was phased out by Ford in 2000, but the van version of the Escort remained in production at Halewood on a small scale until 2002 when it was replaced by the Turkish built Transit Connect. Since 2001 In 1997, Ford announced plans to replace the Escort with the more radically styled Ford Focus. Furthermore, Ford of Europe announced European production of the Focus would only be carried out at Saarlouis, Germany and Valencia, Spain fuelling rumours that Halewood was due to be closed by Ford. However, Jaguar Cars, owned at the time by Ford, was developing a new mid-sized saloon model which was loosely based on the Ford Mondeo. Ford decided that production of this model, the Jaguar X-Type, would commence at Halewood from 2001 onwards. In 2007, Halewood commenced production of the second generation Land Rover Freelander model, Freelander 2, and a dirt track test facility was constructed at Halewood specifically for Freelander 2 and subsequent Land Rover models. In March 2008, Ford finalised a deal to sell Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors, part of the Indian-based Tata Group, one of the world's largest manufacturers of commercial vehicles. Under the terms of the deal, Ford retained ownership of Halewood's transmission plant which it operates in collaboration with Getrag. On 15 July 2009, Jaguar Land Rover announced that it would cease production of the X-Type at the end of 2009, with the loss of 300 jobs, and have a three-week shut down between September and December of that year. On 11 March 2010, the UK Government announced a ¬£27 million grant was to be made available to Jaguar Land Rover for the production of an all-new model, the Range Rover Evoque, subject to the condition it is manufactured at Halewood. In July 2011, production of the Range Rover Evoque started. The Evoque became a best-seller, and was critically acclaimed for its concept-car-like styling. Soon, Jaguar Land Rover raised the number of employees to 3,000, due to the high demand for the Evoque. In early 2012, Jaguar Land Rover announced that they would employ an additional 1,000 staff for Halewood, to meet demand for the Evoque. In August of that year the plant switched to 24-hour running in order to meet demand.Jaguar Land Rover Halewood plant in 24-hour production On 19 June 2014, JLR as announced an investment of ¬£200M at Halewood, enabling the launch in 2014 of the new Land Rover Discovery Sport, the first member of an all-new family of Discovery vehicles.http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/automobiles/tata- motors-owned-jlr-announces-200-mn-pounds-investment-at-halewood- plant/articleshow/36816841.cms Current Products *Land Rover Range Rover Evoque (2011‚Äìpresent) *Land Rover Discovery Sport (2015‚Äìpresent) Former Products *Ford Anglia (1962‚Äì1967) *Ford Corsair (1964‚Äì1969) *Ford Escort (1967‚Äì2000) *Ford Capri (1968‚Äì1976) *Jaguar X-Type (2000‚Äì2009) *Land Rover Freelander 2 (2006‚Äì2014) References Category:Jaguar Land Rover Category:Motor vehicle assembly plants in the United Kingdom ","title":"Halewood Body &amp; Assembly"},{"id":"4501706","title":"L√º Shao"},{"id":"4501715","text":"The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality is a book written by Austrian School economist and libertarian thinker Ludwig von Mises. It is an investigation into the psychological roots of the anti-capitalistic stance that is widespread in the general populations of the capitalist world. Mises suggests various reasons for this mentality, primarily his claim that free competition in the market economy allows for no excuses of one's failures.  Frustrated ambition  'In a society based on caste and status, the individual can ascribe adverse fate to conditions beyond his own control. [For instance] He is a slave because the superhuman powers that determine all becoming had assigned him this rank. [...] It is quite another thing under capitalism. Here everybody's station in life depends on his own doing [...] The sway of the principle, to each according to his accomplishments, does not allow of any excuse for personal shortcomings' (pp. 11‚Äì12) According to the author, faced with this burden many who have fared poorly in the market economy seek a scapegoat to shift the blame from themselves and restore their self-image.  Common misunderstandings  According to von Mises, Marxian philosophy has heavily influenced the way the general public interprets its economic condition and perceives of capitalism. The average wage-earner's high standard of living is viewed as an inevitable result of 'self-acting progress', akin to Marx's 'material productive forces'. It is believed that these material productive forces (e.g. technological innovations) are not only independent of capitalism but will eventually force capitalism to yield to more advanced forms of socialist organisation. Until that day the capitalists will continue to refuse workers their fair share of this progress. The notion of 'fair share' is devoid of meaning, because both capital and labour are necessary to produce goods and it is impossible to assign a proportion of the end product as belonging to either labour or capital. He also argues that even more importantly the historical increase in the average wage-earner's rewards is due solely to the accumulation of capital, and in particular to \\"the fact that the rate of capital accumulation exceeds the rate of increase in population' (p. 88). According to von Mises, \\"All pseudo-economic doctrines which depreciate the role of saving and capital accumulation are absurd [...] What has improved the wage earners' standard of living is the fact that the capital equipment per head of the men eager to earn wages has increased. It is a consequence of this fact that an ever increasing portion of the total amount of usable goods produced goes to the wage earners\\" (p. 89) Criticism The Economist called it a \\"resoundingly silly\\" caricature of economic liberalism and \\"a sad little book\\" that is simplistically dogmatic and displays \\"cocksure superficiality\\" in an abusive tone. The review suggested that the book would receive \\"low marks if presented by a second-year undergraduate to his tutor,\\" and that \\"the case for freedom ... is ill served\\" by such a book. It accused von Mises of attacking straw men and having contempt for the facts of human nature, comparing him in that respect to Marxists.\\"Liberalism in Caricature\\", The Economist Conservative commentator and former Communist Whittaker Chambers published a similarly negative review in the National Review, stating that Mises's thesis that anti-capitalist sentiment was rooted in \\"envy\\" epitomized \\"know-nothing conservatism\\" at its \\"know-nothingest.\\"Quoted in Sam Tanenhaus, Whittaker Chambers: A Biography, (Random House, New York, 1997), p. 500. .

Davis was a member of the Transportation Committee, the Government Operations Committee, and the Public Safety and Rural Roads Subcommittee while serving with the Tennessee General Assembly. Davis was unopposed in his initial election and was reelected three more times with no major-party opposition. Davis was also a delegate to the White House Conference on Small Business. While in the state house, Davis voted aye twice in transportation committee to allow illegal immigrants to apply for Tennessee driver licenses (2001 H.B. 983) (6.05 KB) and also filed legislation on February 3, 2005 (2005 H.B 714) (36.2 KB) for changing county wheel tax legislation that (if enacted) would have taken away the ability of Tennessee citizens to vote aye or nay on local wheel tax referendum questions and give Tennessee county commissioners the sole authority to enact wheel taxes with a simple majority vote. 2006 election to Congress In 2006, Davis gave up his seat in the state house to run for the 1st Congressional District.

U.S. Representative While Davis filed two bills within the U.S. House of Representatives as the original sponsor (one Davis bill was to create a federal \\"American Eagle Day\\"), he signed on as cosponsor to other pending legislation including H.R.621, a House resolution that sought to \\"...amend part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act to restore the Medicare treatment of ownership of oxygen equipment to that in effect before enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.\\" In 2007, U.S. Rep.

The highway travels through mostly rural areas of Franklin. Adams, Grant, Douglas, and Okanogan counties and is designated as part of the National Highway System between Mesa and Moses Lake and as the Coulee Corridor Scenic Byway between Othello and Coulee City for passing through the Grand Coulee. SR 17 begins in Mesa at an interchange with U.S. Route 395 (US 395) and travels north and intersects SR 26 near Othello before entering Moses Lake, where the highway intersects Interstate 90 (I-90) and travels as a partial expressway. SR 17 continues north, intersecting SR 28 in Soap Lake, through the Grand Coulee to a short concurrency with US 2 west of Coulee City. The highway turns northwest and crosses the Columbia River on the Columbia River Bridge at Bridgeport before ending at US 97 in Brewster at the southwestern edge of the Colville Indian Reservation. SR 17 was established during the merger of three highways during the 1964 highway renumbering: Secondary State Highway 11G (SSH 11G) between Eltopia and Soap Lake, a branch of Primary State Highway 7 (PSH 7) between Soap Lake and Coulee City, and a branch of PSH 10 between Coulee City and Brewster. The PSH 10 branch was codified in 1931 as a branch of State Road 10 and was followed by the PSH 7 branch during the creation of the primary state highway system in 1937. The Columbia River Bridge at Bridgeport was completed in 1950 and the PSH 10 branch was re-aligned onto the north side of the Columbia River the following year. SSH 11G was created in 1951 and was moved to a wider, straighter route between Moses Lake and Soap Lake in the 1960s. The highway was replaced by a limited-access highway north of Moses Lake in 2007. SR 17 between Eltopia and Mesa was replaced by US 395 in 1979 as part of a larger series of projects in the area to improve the highway in Franklin County. Route description Alkali Lake in the Grand Coulee, heading towards Coulee City. SR 17 begins at a diamond interchange with US 395 southeast of Mesa in Franklin County. The highway travels northwest through Mesa, where it crosses over a BNSF rail line and runs through Esquatzel Coulee before intersecting the terminus of SR 260 west of Connell in the Paradise Flats. SR 17 travels east of Scooteney Reservoir and northwest into Adams County before intersecting SR 26 in a diamond interchange east of Othello. The highway continues north into Grant County as the Coulee Corridor Scenic Byway and travels over the Columbia Basin Railroad into rural Adams County. The roadway serves as the western terminus of SR 170 and the eastern terminus of SR 262 west of Warden before continuing northwest towards Moses Lake. SR 17 travels into the city of Moses Lake and intersects I-90 in a partial cloverleaf interchange, serving as the eastern terminus of I-90 Business and its concurrency with SR 17. The roadway expands to four lanes and turns north at Pioneer Way, where I-90 Business leaves the concurrency and travels into Downtown Moses Lake. SR 17 heads around Moses Lake and turn northwest onto a limited-access highway after an intersection with Broadway Avenue, signed as the northern terminus of SR 171\\\\. The limited-access highway intersects Stratford Road in a diamond interchange north of the city and heads northwest along Moses Lake through Moses Lake North, passing south of Grant County International Airport. SR 17 crosses Rocky Ford Creek and intersects SR 282 east of Ephrata in rural Grant County. The highway continues north and passes Ephrata Municipal Airport before it intersects SR 28 in Soap Lake. SR 17 and the Coulee Corridor Scenic Byway continue northwest through the Grand Coulee and passing several lakes, including Soap Lake, Lake Lenore and Alkali Lake. The highway turns northeast onto the west shores of Blue Lake and Park Lake, and passes the Blue Lake rest area. The roadway enters Sun Lakes State Park and passes Dry Falls at the north end of the Grand Coulee. SR 17 intersects US 2, the continuation of the Coulee Corridor Scenic Byway, west of Coulee City at the southern end of Banks Lake and begins a concurrency into Douglas County. SR 17 briefly travels west with US 2 and turns north to intersect the eastern terminus of SR 172 at Sims Corner. From Sims Corner, the roadway follows East Foster Creek northward to the western terminus of SR 174 and its spur route in Leahy. The highway continues northwest to Bridgeport at the southern terminus of SR 173 and crossing the Columbia River on the Columbia River Bridge (also named the Bridgeport Bridge) downstream from the Chief Joseph Dam. The steel continuous riveted deck truss bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, carries SR 17 into Okanogan County and the Colville Indian Reservation, west of Bridgeport State Park. The highway continues north along the east bank of the Columbia River before passing through Fort Okanogan and ending at an intersection with US 97 east of Brewster near the confluence of the Columbia and Okanogan rivers. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of the highway was the expressway between SR 171 and Stratford Road in Moses Lake, serving an average of 19,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section of the highway was between SR 172 in Sims Corner and SR 174 in Leahy, serving an average of 570 vehicles. SR 17 between Mesa and the Moses Lake area is designated as part of the National Highway System, which includes roadways important to the national economy, defense, and mobility; and as part of WSDOT's Highways of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington. History SR 17 on the shores of Lake Lenore, passing through the Grand Coulee on a highway built in the 1930s. SR 17 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering as the successor to three highways that were designated under the primary and secondary state highway system: SSH 11G from US 395 and PSH 11 in Eltopia to PSH 7 in Soap Lake, a branch of PSH 7 from Soap Lake to US 2 and PSH 2 west of Coulee City, and a branch of PSH 10 from Coulee City to US 97 and PSH 10 east of Brewster. The Coulee City-Brewster branch of PSH 10 was codified in 1931 as a branch of State Road 10 and re-codified in 1937, during the creation of the primary and secondary state highways; however, the highway was not built between Sims Corner and Bridgeport until the 1950s. The Soap Lake-Coulee City branch of PSH 7 was established in 1937 to serve as an alternate route to SSH 2F, avoiding the Grand Coulee Dam. In 1951, the PSH 10 branch between Bridgeport and Brewster was moved north of the Columbia River via the newly built Columbia River Bridge on the present route of SR 17, as the old route through Bridgeport and over the Brewster Bridge became a new branch that was later signed in 1964 as SR 173. SSH 11G was also created in 1951, traveling north from US 395 in Eltopia through Mesa and Moses Lake to Soap Lake along existing gravel roads from the late 1930s, later straightened and widened in the 1970s. SR 17 was originally a highway, extending south from Mesa to Eltopia when it was created in 1964 and codified in 1970, but was shortened by to its current route after US 395 was re-aligned between Eltopia and Connell. The new alignment, part of improvements to SR 17 in the Mesa area in the late 1960s, was approved in 1968 and opened in late 1979. No major revisions to the route of SR 17 have occurred since 1979, as WSDOT has improved the sections of the highway through widening and barriers. Within Moses Lake, the two-lane highway was designated to be widened to a four-lane limited-access highway between Pioneer Way and Stratford Road in 1997 and completed a decade later on October 8, 2007. The highway between SR 26 in Othello to US 2 west of Coulee City was designated as the Coulee Corridor Scenic Byway under the Washington State Scenic and Recreational Highways program in 1967 and under the National Scenic Byway program on September 22, 2005.

In the late Roman Empire, the actuarius was an official charged with the distribution of wages and provisions to the Roman military.. In this capacity, the post is attested at least until the 6th century, but appears only in antiquated legal texts thereafter.

Like the Villager and Bermuda station wagons, the Roundup was built on a wheelbase shared with Ford's station wagons, as well as core body stampings. It had an approach angle of 21¬∞ and an overall length of 205.42 in. The Roundup represented the base trim level available within the Edsel brand for a station wagon, and was only available during Edsel's introductory year of 1958. The Roundup was available only as a six-passenger two-door station wagon. The Roundup came with black rubber flooring, armrests, front and rear ashtrays, dome and courtesy lights, and a white vinyl headliner. A split-back front seat was standard to allow access to the back seat. In place of roll- down rear windows, the Roundup used sliding windows. To further separate the Roundup from the Ford Ranch Wagon on which it was based, the Roundup received Edsel's front fascia and grille assembly, as well as unique boomerang-shaped taillights. The shape of the taillights posed a problem when used as turn indicators ‚Äì the left hand taillight appeared as an arrow pointing right and vice versa from a distance. All station wagons shared the Edsel Ranger's engine availability, with a 361 cubic inch V8 as standard, as was a three- speed manual transmission. Buyers also had the option of a three-speed automatic transmission with a standard column-mounted gear selector, or could choose Edsel's highly promoted but trouble-prone Teletouch automatic, which placed its drive-selection buttons in the steering wheel hub. While their roll-out was highly publicized in the fall of 1957, Edsels were a marketing disaster for Ford. Total output for the Roundup stood at 963 units. The low output number could be attributed to the declining popularity of two-door wagons in the American market and Edsel's lack of consumer appeal. For the 1959 model year, the Roundup and the premium Bermuda station wagons were dropped, leaving the mid-value Villager as Edsel's sole station wagon model. 1958 Edsel Roundup shows off its (in)famous \\"horse collar\\" grille References   External links * Edsel Spotters Guide * Edsel.com History, specifications, resources for owners. * Smith Motor Company Virtual Edsel Dealer * The International Edsel Club * Edsel.US Restorer's discussion group Roundup Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Station wagons Category:Cars introduced in 1958 ","title":"Edsel Roundup"},{"id":"4501826","text":"Mohammed bin Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Arabic: ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÜŸàÿßŸÅ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑÿπÿ≤Ÿäÿ≤ ÿ¢ŸÑ ÿ≥ÿπŸàÿØ; born 22 May 1953) and is a Saudi diplomat who had been Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the United Kingdom between 2005 and 2018.

Biography Born in Durham, England, Ferguson was raised in London, Ontario, and graduated from the University of Western Ontario with a BA in English and French. In the summer of 1946 he was hired as an announcer at radio station CFPL in London, but later that year relocated to Halifax, Nova Scotia, for the opportunity to join the CBC as a staff announcer with the local station in the CBC Halifax Radio Building. According to his autobiography, And Now...Here's Max (1967), he was appalled to find among his assignments the task of hosting a cowboy music show called After Breakfast Breakdown. To protect his anonymity, and in hopes of quick reassignment, he improvised the character of \\"Old Rawhide\\", assuming the voice of an elderly ranch hand and giving colourfully disdainful appraisals of the songs he introduced. The character was a breath of fresh air to listeners of the staid national broadcaster, and they relayed their approval with volumes of mail. Accepting his fate, Ferguson devised an entire repertory company of raucous and bizarre characters to interact with Rawhide (all voiced by Ferguson) to amuse himself and his audience, creating daily skits which parodied literary classics and satirized current events and CBC personalities. Recurring characters (other than Rawhide) included pompous, adenoidal CBC announcer Marvin Mellobell, The Goomer Brothers, Little Harold, The Black Widow Spider, and the adventurous Granny. In 1949, the show's popularity led the corporation to transfer Ferguson to its head office in Toronto, where he would broadcast nationally. Rawhide's first coast-to-coast broadcasts caused something of a national controversy when a Member of Parliament rose to denounce the show for its low humour and abuse of the English language. However, it remained one of the most popular programs on air, lasting some seventeen years. Along the way, the cowboy music was dropped in favour of esoteric folk music, making Ferguson a pioneer in the world music genre long before the term existed. He was also able to originate his broadcasts from his beloved Maritimes for a few years in the mid-1950s. Between 1955 and 1960, Ferguson recorded three albums on Folkways Records, each a part of the Rawhide satirical series. From 1954 to 1961, (while continuing the Rawhide radio program) he branched out to television to host the nightly CBC Halifax program Gazette, and later the CBC Toronto production Tabloid. Ferguson announced he was retiring Rawhide and all of the associated Rawhide characters in 1962, and kept to his word‚Äîhis subsequent radio ventures did not incorporate any of these characters. Instead, he launched the 5-days- a-week Max Ferguson Show beginning in 1962, featuring ethnic music and topical skits based on the news of the day. The latter were always highlighted by Ferguson's uncanny ability to mimic prominent politicians and celebrities. Ferguson wrote his own topical sketches, based on the morning's news, and performed all the voices live-to-air. The show was introduced in grandiloquent fashion by another CBC legend, Allan McFee, who always ended his piece with the mellifluous \\"And now...here's Max\\". Ferguson was the subject of the 1966 National Film Board of Canada profile Max in the Morning which detailed a typical morning spent preparing and hosting his radio show. That same year he went down in history as the first man to voice the Hulk for Marvel Comics in \\"The Marvel Super Heroes\\" show with fellow radio host Paul Soles voicing Bruce Banner. He also narrated several films, and wrote the whimsical children's story and its subsequent film short \\"Has Anybody Seen My Umbrella?\\" (1990). The radio show remained what Ferguson was best known for, however. The daily Max Ferguson Show wrapped up on June 25, 1971 after a -year run; Ferguson's final sketch featured John Diefenbaker, Pierre Trudeau and Robert Stanfield (all voiced by Ferguson) expressing relief that they would no longer be on the show. After some time off, Ferguson returned to the CBC airwaves, appearing on Saturday morning. For this iteration of The Max Ferguson Show‚Äîwhich would run for over 25 years‚ÄîFerguson dropped the skits and relied exclusively on his outspoken charm and facility with the language, as well as his unique selection of offbeat music and comedy tracks. Long-time announcer McFee, whose programme The Eclectic Circus, preceded Max's show, retired from the CBC in 1989; but he continued to introduce Ferguson's show until failing health forced him to step down in early 1991. Shelagh Rogers, who had appeared fairly regularly starting in the mid-90s as a sort of conversational companion for Ferguson, assumed the announcer's task for the show's final few months. Rogers soon became a top network host in her own right. Max Ferguson retired from broadcasting in 1998, having spent over 50 years at the CBC. Over the years, he garnered many awards, including the 1968 Stephen Leacock Award for humour for his autobiography, And Now...Here's Max. He was appointed an Officer of The Order of Canada in 1970 and in 2001 was chosen as a recipient of the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement. He was the recipient of the John Drainie Award and the Gordon Sinclair Award. He held honorary degrees from the University of Western Ontario, Dalhousie University, the University of Waterloo, Brock University and the University of Saskatchewan.

At first participants in the festival were mainly Chinese, however it has since become an international festival and competition, with the 2018 festival attracting 18 million visitors and generating 28.7 billion yuan ($4.4 billion) of revenue. The festival includes the world's biggest ice sculptures. Officially, the festival starts on January 5 and lasts till late February. However, exhibits often open earlier and stay longer, weather permitting. While ice sculptures are erected throughout the city, there are two main exhibition areas: * Sun Island is a recreational area on the opposite side of the Songhua River from the city, which features an expo of enormous snow sculptures. * Ice and Snow World is an area open in the afternoon and at night which features illuminated full size buildings made from blocks of 2‚Äì3' thick ice taken directly from the Songhua River. The park usually opens from late December to late February. In 1999, the first Ice and Snow World opened to public to celebrate the millennium. Each year the park has to be rebuilt with newly designed ice buildings and snow and ice sculptures. In recent years, the park has been as large as 80 hectares. During the festival, there are ice lantern park touring activities held in many parks in the city. Winter activities during the festival include Yabuli alpine skiing, winter-swimming in the Songhua River, and the ice- lantern exhibition in Zhaolin Garden. Harbin is located in Northeast China and receives cold winter wind from Siberia. The average temperature in summer is 21.2 ¬∞C (70.2 ¬∞F), and ‚Äì16.8 ¬∞C (1.8 ¬∞F) in winter. Annual lows of -25 ¬∞C (‚Äì13 ¬∞F) are not uncommon.  History  Ice sculpture erected in the 2010 Ice and Snow festival The festival originated in Harbin's traditional ice lantern show and garden party that takes place in winter, which began in 1963. It was interrupted for a number of years during the Cultural Revolution, but has since been resumed when an annual event at Zhaolin Park was announced on January 5, 1985. In 2001 the Harbin Ice Festival was merged with Heilongjiang's International Ski Festival and got its new formal name, the Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival. In 2007, the festival featured a Canadian themed sculpture, in the memory of a Canadian doctor Norman Bethune. It was awarded a Guinness Record for the world's largest snow sculpture: 250 metres long, high, using over 13,000 cubic metres of snow. The composition consisted of two parts: the \\"Niagara Falls\\" and the \\"crossing the Bering Strait\\" (the latter depicting the migration of the First Nations). In 2014, the festival celebrated its 30th anniversary with the theme \\"50-Year Ice Snow, Charming Harbin\\". Various fairs, competitions and expos were held from December 20, 2013 to February 28, 2014. In 2015, the 31st Harbin Ice Snow Festival opened on January 5 and was themed \\"Ice Snow Harbin, Charming China Dreams around the world [\\" with opening ceremony, firework show, ice lanterns , birthday parties, snow sculpture competitions and expos, as well as winter swimming, winter fishing, group wedding ceremony, fashion shows, concerts, ice sport games lasting from December 22, 2014 to early March 2015. At the 35th annual festival held in 2019, the festival's most popular attraction, the Harbin Ice and Snow World, took up over 600,000 square meters and included more than 100 landmarks. It was made from 110,000 cubic meters of ice and 120,000 cubic meters of snow. The festival also included ice sculptures by artists from 12 different countries competing in the annual competition. With its 36th year in 2020, this festival is presently viewed as one of the world's top winter celebrations, joining the positions of the Sapporo Snow Festival in Japan, Canada's Quebec Winter Carnival and Norway's Holmenkollen Ski Festival. In 2020 the sculptures are produced using roughly 220,000 cubic meters of ice blocks, all pulled from the close by Songhua River.https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/harbin-ice-and-snow- festival-2020-china/index.html Construction Ice sculpture of the Sphinx erected for the 2010 festival Swing saws are used to carve ice into blocks, taken from the frozen surface of the Songhua River. Chisels, ice picks and various types of saws are then used by ice sculptors to carve out large scaled ice sculptures, many of them intricately designed and worked on all day and night prior to the commencement of the festival. Deionised water can also be used, producing ice blocks as transparent as glass to make clear sculptures rather than translucent ones. Multicoloured lights are also used to give colour to ice, creating variations on sculptured spectacles when lit up especially at night. Some ice sculptures made in previous years include: buildings and monuments of different architectural types and styles, figures including animals people and mythical creatures, slippery dips or ice slides and lanterns. Apart from winter recreational activities available in Harbin, these exquisitely detailed, mass-produced ice sculptures are the main draw card in attracting tourists around the world to the festival.

Part of Operation Torch (the Allied invasion of French North Africa, 8 November 1942) it involved a direct landing of infantry into the Vichy French port of Algiers with the intention of capturing the port facilities before they could be destroyed.Roskill p325 Background The attacking forces were two Royal Navy destroyers, and (commanded by Henry Fancourt) carrying 600 troops of the 3d Battalion, 135th Infantry, (commanded by Colonel Edwin Swenson), part of the US 34th Infantry Division. The plan was to land the troops directly into the port. It was hoped that either complete surprise would be achieved or that the defenders would support the invasion to the extent at least of refusing to fire on the attackers. However the Vichy forces opened fire on the ships, damaging them heavily. Action At 4.00 am on the morning of 8 November 1942 Malcolm and Broke approached Algiers Harbour. They were regarded as hostile by the defending Vichy troops, who opened fire at 4.06 am. Malcolm tried to break through the boom but was hit and severely damaged by a shell fired from the shore. Ten of her crew were dead, many more were injured and three of her four boilers were extinguished, cutting her speed to 4 knots. She was forced to retreat and played no further part in the operation. Initially, Broke had better luck. On her third attempt, she sliced through the boom and deposited her troops under fire on the Quai de F√©camp, and then retreated. This was four hours after the operation had started. Broke's luck ran out as she withdrew; she was hit by shore batteries which compounded on earlier damage and after being taken in tow, she sank on 10 November. The landed infantry were surrounded and forced to surrender seven hours later. However they succeeded in preventing the destruction of the port before the defenders in turn surrendered to the larger invading forces. Aftermath A similar operation was carried out at Oran (Operation Reservist), but with even less success; however the Torch landings as a whole were successful, the Terminal and Reservist segments being the only setbacks in the entire operation.

The motorcycles in their day gained a reputation for being robust and innovative. The Laverda brand was absorbed by Piaggio when, in 2004, Piaggio absorbed Aprilia. Piaggio has elected to quietly close all activities related to the Laverda brand and has publicly stated that they would be willing to sell the rights to the brand if an investor should appear. As of 2015, Laverda.com no longer redirects to Aprilia's website. Currently, laverda.com shows the history of company between 1873 and 2004. History Early history The roots of the Laverda Motorcycle company go back to 1873, when Pietro Laverda (1845-1930) decided to start an agricultural engines enterprise ‚Äì Laverda S.p.A. ‚Äì in the small rural village of Breganze in Vicenza province (North-East of Italy). Almost exactly three quarters of a century later, with a spirit of enterprise and feeling the need to improve the situation of an economically underdeveloped region which had suffered badly from two world wars, in October 1949, Pietro's grandson Francesco founded Moto Laverda S.A.S. ‚Äì Dottore Francesco Laverda e fratelli. Assisted by Luciano Zen, and after hours of running the normal agricultural business, Francesco had started in 1947 to design a small motorcycle. Word has it, that some engine parts were cast in Francesco's kitchen, confirming that at least initially, the project was not regarded as a serious business proposition. What most likely started as an evening pastime garage project of two technical enthusiasts was to become one of the most successful motorcycles in history. A simple four stroke 75 cc bike with girder forks and a fully enclosed drive chain. However, the little bike showed promise and so on October 13, 1949, the statutes of Moto Laverda were officially submitted to the Chamber of Commerce of Vicenza. Over the next several years, Laverda became well known for building small capacity machines of high quality, durability and relative innovation for the time. To prove this, right from the beginning they modified their bikes in order to race them in distance and endurance events like the Milan-Taranto, the Giro d'Italia and the Cavalcata delle Dolomiti. In 1951 upon their first entry in the Milan-Taranto, the 75 cc Laverdas finished 4th, 5th, 6th and 10th in their class, racing against renowned marques like Ducati, Moto Guzzi, Alpino, Verga, Cimatti, Navarra, Ardito, Capriolo and Ceccato. Inspired by these results, and after once again improving their bikes, Laverda entered 20 bikes the following year in the 15th running of the Milan-Taranto in 1952. In this race which covered a distance of 1410 km they took the first five places. The winner was Nino Castellani, L. Marchi came second and F. Diolio came third. In total they had 16 bikes amongst the first 20 of the classification. Laverda motorcycles thus became a firm favorite among racing clubmen due to their record for reliable performance. Over the next two decades, Laverda would go on to produce new models of ever increasing capacity and capability, in different sectors of the market. Off-road, trial and motocross machines were developed in conjunction with other manufacturers like Z√ºndapp, BMW and Husqvarna, and were successfully raced. But the real development came in street models, which began to earn a good reputation as classy, low maintenance and quiet motorcycles. From that first 75 cc single, they eventually went on to produce different bikes ranging from scooters, the Laverdino commuter and eventually to the 200 cc twin. The big twins By the late 1960s, Francesco and brothers began sketching out a new breed of large motorcycles that would be built around an all new 650 cc parallel twin engine. The brand was now sufficiently strong and well known, and Francesco's son Massimo had just returned from the USA where it was clear that sales were dominated by large capacity British and American hardware suited for long distance traveling. Above all this, was a desire to produce a prestigious and powerful machine that could conceivably take on the best and finest from Moto-Guzzi, BMW and the rapidly emerging Japanese. In November 1966 Laverda exhibited the result of its thinking with the 650 prototype at Earls Court in London. While not an extreme sport bike in any sense, it exhibited all the virtues that Laverda had become synonymous with. At the same time its appearance disrupted the concept of a big bore parallel twin being British built. After this first appearance, Luciano Zen and Massimo Laverda retreated until April 1968, working hard in order to prepare the bike for production. By now they had developed a 750 cc version too. They were confident enough to enter four examples in the prestigious Giro d'Italia. Two 650 and two 750 machines provided Laverda with victory for the 650 in her class, with three bikes finishing in the first 6 and all in the top 10! Two weeks after this victory the first 650 cc production models left the factory. The bikes carried the finest components available at the time, from British Smiths instruments, Pankl con-rods, Ceriani suspension, Mondial pistons, to Bosch electrical parts and (revolutionary at the time!) Japanese Nippon-Denso starter, thus eliminating the one problem plaguing nearly all contemporary British and Italian motorcycles at the time: their electrical unreliability. The 650 cc offered superior comfort and stability with its handling at least equivalent to the competition. Of course, it also carried a high price. It is difficult to quantify production quantities since frame numbering was shared with the 750 launched in May 1968 - as few as 52 or up to 200 Laverda 650 cc were produced. 750 Laverda 750 SF (1972) The true birth of Laverda as a serious big bike brand occurred with the introduction of 750 cc; its appearance halted sales of the recently introduced 650. Many of the first bikes were produced for the American market under the brand \\"American Eagle\\", which were imported to the US from 1968 until 1969 by Jack McCormack, and were used by stunt rider Evel Knievel until 1970. The 750 was identical to the 650 except for the lower compression and carburettor rejetting. In 1969 the \\"750 S\\" and the \\"750 GT\\" were born, both equipped with an engine which would truly start the Laverda fame. Both engine and frame were reworked: power was increased to for the S. 3 bikes were entered by the factory at the 1969 Dutch 24-hour endurance race in Oss, the 750S was clearly the fastest bike until piston failure left just one machine to finish fourth. Just like the agricultural machinery made by Laverda S.p.A., the other family business, Laverdas were built to be indestructible. The parallel twin cylinder engine featured no less than five main bearings (four crankcase bearings and a needle-roller outrigger bearing in the primary chaincase cover), a duplex cam chain, and a starter motor easily twice as powerful as needed. Of course, this made the engine and subsequently the entire bike heavier than other bikes of the same vintage, such as the Ducati 750. Laverda 750 SFC The SF evolved to include disc brakes and cast alloy wheels. Developed from the 750S road bike was the 750 SFC (super freni competizione), a half-faired racer that was developed to win endurance events like the Oss 24 hours, Barcelona 24 hours and the Bol D'Or at Le Mans. This it did, often placed first, second and third in the same race, and dominating the international endurance race circuit in 1971. Distinguished by its characteristic orange paint which would become the company's race department colour, its smooth aerodynamic fairing and upswept exhaust, the SFC was Laverda's flagship product and best advertisement, flaunting pedigree and the message of durability, quality, and exclusivity. The SFC \\"Series 15,000\\" was featured in the Guggenheim Museum in New York's 1999 exhibit The Art of the Motorcycle as one of the most iconic bikes of the 1970s. Triples By the late 1960s, Laverda was facing increasing competition from the Japanese. While launching their new model range in 1968, the company turned its attention to a new three-cylinder powerplant, which was first shown as a prototype at the Milan and Geneva shows in 1969. The prototype was essentially a 750 twin with an additional cylinder. After extensive testing, modifications, and mechanical engineering, the company finally unveiled the new liter-class, three-cylinder bike in competition at the Zeltweg race in Austria. The bike that went into production shortly later in 1972 was recognisable as a motorcycle of the modern era, but it was still configured in a conservative layout, sharing some of the features of the earlier SF/SFC models, such as the high-quality alloy castings and distinctive styling. The 981 cc triple provided more power than the outgoing twins, with not much more weight. The 1973-1981 Laverda 1000 3C Triple model that made @ 7,250rpm and reaching speeds of more than . LAVERDA JOTA 1000cc. ITALY 1976-1982 The new Laverda Jota based on the 3C made a big impression in 1976 producing and reaching speeds of , thanks to the factory racing parts fitted into the road engine directly at the factory, it was the fastest production motorcycle to date. British importer Roger Slater worked with the factory to develop a high-performance version of the bike, the Jota. Laverda three-cylinder engines up to 1982 featured a 180-degree crankshaft arrangement, in which the center piston is at the top of its stroke when the two outer pistons are at the bottom. This purposefully out-of-phase design gave the 1,000 cc Laverdas a distinctive character. The engine evolved into a smoother, rubber mounted 120 degree configuration in 1982. The three cylinder 1978-1979 Laverda 1200 TS Mirage was one of the largest displacements ever to be fitted on a machine from Laverda. The produced and and a weight of . V6 In 1977, Laverda unveiled a V6 at the Milan Show, and went on to enter it in the 24-hour Bol d'Or race held at the Paul Ricard circuit in France. While notching an impressive straight-away speed of during a practice run, its performance in the race was hindered by a bulky build and it did not finish the race. Laverda planned on re-entering the V6 in the 1979 race but rule changes limited Endurance racers to four cylinders and the V6 project was officially ended. Middleweight twins Laverda launched a smaller 500 cc twin cylinder eight-valve entry-level machine named the Alpina in 1977 (quickly renamed Alpino due to trademark infringement and Zeta in the USA). It came with a six-speed gearbox and balance shaft. A 350 cc version of the Alpino was also available from November 1977 - primarily designed for the home Italian market where a high tax was payable for machines over 350 cc. This was followed by the improved Alpino S and Formula 500 racer in 1978, to support a single model race series. Its import into the UK led Roger Slater to develop the Montjuic in 1979 which was a road legal F500 with lights, sidestand & instruments. It evolved into the mk2 in 1981. EEC noise restrictions saw its demise by 1983. Tellingly, Massimo Laverda said that each Alpino sold lost the factory money. Then somewhere in the mid eighties an enduro frame was built with 500 cc engine, which was followed by the Atlas series with 570 cc engine and improved oil cooling. Beginning of the end By the 1980s, the European motorcycle industry as a whole was reeling from Japanese competition, causing many companies like NVT (the amalgamated surviving British companies Norton, Triumph, and BSA), Moto-Guzzi, and many others to struggle or disappear completely. Laverda attempted to update their product line by introducing the RGS sports tourer in 1983, with features such unbreakable Bayflex plastic mouldings; fuel filler in the fairing; integrated but removable luggage (Executive version), and adjustable footpeg position. In 1985, came the SFC 1000 sports model - a badge engineered attempt based on the RGS to reprise the hallowed SFC name. Underneath the new skin were engines and technologies that were ten years out of date and overpriced when compared to the lighter, faster, cheaper and more advanced Japanese bikes. As an example, in 1983 the Montjuic mk2 cost the same as the four-cylinder, Kawasaki Z1000J. On the race tracks too, the Japanese bikes dominated. Flirtations with a highly complex aluminum framed, 350 cc three-cylinder two-stroke and the unsuccessful V6 endurance racer consumed resources that the small factory could not afford. Combined with this, the motorcycle industry in general was in trouble as sales dropped. In these conditions, the Laverda family bowed out by 1985. Takeovers and rebirth Initiatives to save Laverda, included a Japanese investment company who wanted to sell apparel and other merchandise under the name; to a local government initiative which tried to run the factory as a co-operative; but each of these failed. 1998 Laverda Ghost Strike 1997 Laverda 750 Strike In 1993, millionaire Francesco Tognon bought everything, thus saving the company and setting up what looked like the first serious attempt in a decade to relaunch the brand. Over the next five years, they launched a small selection of new sports models based on a thorough redo of the DOHC 650 cc parallel-twin derived from the old Alpino, upped to 668 cc and clothed in contemporary superbike livery. These bikes were outfitted with Weber-Marelli electronic fuel injection, Brembo Gold Line brakes, fully adjustable Paioli suspension (White Power on some models), hollow spoke Marchesini wheels and a modern beam or trellis frame. Within a year and a half, a larger, water cooled 750 appeared with a new engine in an aluminum beam chassis developed by frame specialist Nico Bakker. At successive international motorcycle shows, Laverda displayed mockups of new models they were planning to build, including an all new, 900 cc liquid-cooled three- cylinder engine; The 750 roadster variants Ghost and Strike; the Lynx, a small, naked roadster with a Suzuki 650 cc V-twin engine; and finally the 800TTS trail/enduro, which aimed to take on the likes of the Cagiva Gran Canyon and Honda Transalp. The venture failed after five years. Aprilia takeover Along with historical rival Moto Guzzi, the Laverda motorcycle brand was purchased by Aprilia S.p.a (another Italian motorcycle manufacturer based in the same region) in 2000, restructured and incorporated into the Aprilia Group. Several projects that had been in development and the existing two motorcycles in production, were cancelled. Aprilia founded a new Laverda division business unit which shortly after began importing low cost Asian scooters and quads and selling them under the Laverda brand name. In 2003, Laverda presented a new SFC prototype, based on a heavily revised Aprilia RSV 1000 at the Milan EICMA motorcycle show. While stunning in many aspects, in particular the attention to component and mechanical detailing, it did not generate enough positive interest to merit further development. In 2004, the Aprilia Group was acquired by Piaggio, the giant scooter manufacturer of Vespa fame. Piaggio elected to close all activities related to the Laverda brand, and has publicly stated that they would be willing to sell the rights to the brand if an investor should appear. Today, the brand is no longer in use.

Both assemblies conduct legislative sessions at the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. History The National Assembly was preceded by the Council of State, a legislative council appointed by the head of state, mostly from among generals. The Council of State was first formed by Jean-Jacques Dessalines under his 1804 imperial constitution. Following his 1806 assassination, his northern general and the new Chief of the Provisional Government Henri Christophe called a Constituent Assembly to meet in Port-au-Prince in November. However, a power struggle ensued between supporters of Christophe and his fellow general Alexandre Petion: Christophe had sought to ensure a majority of parishes from his power base in the Northern and Artibonite departments in the Assembly, but Petion authorized the election of deputies from parishes in the Western and Southern departments, counteracting Christophe. This resulted in a constitution which was more favorable to Petion's demands for a republican form of government. Under Petion's guidance, the constitution was approved, and the Assembly elected Christophe president and elected a powerful unicameral 24-member Senate. Christophe and Petion came to violent blows, with Christophe eventually retreating to Cap Francais (now Cap-Haitien) and forming an \\"Assembly of the mandatories of the people\\" which elected him President and adopted his own constitution in February 1807. The Senate, meanwhile, met in Port-au-Prince, and formally replaced Christophe with then-Senator Petion as president. This resulted in two separately-governed countries. Petion eventually tired of the 1806 constitution's limitations on his power, and he eventually drafted a major revision to the constitution in 1816, which established a bicameral parliament, consisting of the House of Representatives of the Communes and the Senate, as well as a separate judicial branch headed by the Tribunal of Cassation. The new parliament also elected Petion president for life, and allowed him to govern more or less by decree. This era, which continued under Petion's successor Jean-Pierre Boyer, ended in 1843, when Boyer resigned and went into exile. A new provisional government assembled a Constituent Assembly, which drafted a new constitution and restored much of parliament's former power to the Parliament against the new president Charles Rivi√®re-H√©rard. But under his successor, Philippe Guerrier, the Parliament was temporarily replaced by a smaller appointed Council of State which held legislative power for the next two years until it was turned into a Senate in 1846 under Jean-Baptiste Rich√©. Under the 1964 and 1971 Duvalier constitutions, the body became a unicameral Legislature with the abolition of the Senate. The Senate was subsequently restored in 1988. Houses Senate The Senate consists of thirty seats, with three members from each of the ten administrative departments. Prior to the creation of the department of Nippes in 2003, there were twenty-seven seats. Senators are elected by popular vote to six-year terms, with one-third elected every two years. After the elections of 2000, twenty-six of the then twenty-seven seats were held by Jean-Bertrand Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party. The Senate was not in session following the overthrow of Aristide's government in February 2004. An interim government was put in place following the rebellion, and the remaining Senators were not recognised during that time. The Senate was re-established and elections were held on 21 April 2006. In the Senate elections of 2009 LESPWA won five seats, and five parties won one seat each (OPL, AAA, FUSION, KONBA, UCADDE), as well as an independent. Chamber of Deputies The Chamber of Deputies has ninety-nine members (previously eighty-three) who are elected by popular vote to four-year terms. Candidates from Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party took seventy-three of the then eighty-three seats in the 2000 elections. Following the coup d'√©tat and the overthrow of the government in February 2004, the Chamber of Deputies remained empty. It was re-established along with the Senate, and elections were held on 21 April 2006. The next Chamber elections are scheduled for 2010. National Assembly The National Assembly () is a joint session of Parliament. The National Assembly is convened for specific purposes laid out in the Constitution. Meetings of the National Assembly are presided over by the President of the Senate, with the President of the Chamber of Deputies assisting. The Secretaries of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also serve as Secretaries of the National Assembly. The National Assembly building was destroyed during the earthquake on 12 January 2010.

History Lord Archibald Hamilton bought the estate in 1719 from Mrs Elizabeth Baker and built a new villa on the site. Frederick, Prince of Wales (father of King George III) bought the house from Lord Archibald in 1738. Conway's Bridge The estate was purchased by Henry Seymour Conway in 1752 and he made extensive improvements. Humphrey Gainsborough, brother of the artist Thomas Gainsborough, designed Conway's Bridge, built in 1763 at Park Place. The rustic arched stone structure close to the River Thames was built with stone taken from the ruins of Reading Abbey and still carries traffic on the road between Wargrave and Henley-on-Thames. Henry Hawkins Tremayne visited Park Place in 1785 whilst touring various gardens in southern England. He enthused about the garden, being especially impressed by its subterranean passages, menagerie, temples and \\"Rustick\\" bridge. These provided inspiration for his own new garden, now better known as the Lost Gardens of Heligan. In 1797, following the death of Conway, the estate was bought by James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury who auctioned the estate in 1816 with the main lot (mansion & park) being purchased by Henry Piper Sperling. In 1824 Henry Sperling exchanged the estate for Norbury Park, Surrey, with his cousin Ebenezer Fuller Maitland of Shinfield Park, Berkshire. He erected The Obelisk in memory of Queen Victoria's accession, also known as the Victoria memorial ‚Äì originally the late 17th century spire of St. Bride's, Fleet Street, designed by Christopher Wren. Ebenezer Fuller Maitland died in 1858 at which point Queen Victoria visited with the intention of purchasing the estate for the Prince of Wales; Ebenezer's wife remained in the house until her death in 1865 when their son William Fuller Maitland took over ownership. An attempt to sell by auction was made in 1866, but the eventual sale took place in 1867. The estate was bought at that time by Charles Easton of Whiteknights, Reading ‚Äì a speculator, purchased with the intention of dividing the then 800-acre estate. In 1869 the estate was bought by John Noble (Noble's Paints & Varnishes). The Noble family owned the estate until 1947 when John Noble's son Wilson Noble auctioned the property and land off in a number of lots. The house was bought by the Middlesex County Council and in 1965 ownership was transferred to Hillingdon Council. The house was used as a boarding school for children 11 to 16 with health or emotional problems until 1988 when it was sold to private owners. The house was purchased by a consortium which looked to develop it into a country club, but failed to gain planning permission from Wokingham Council. Parts of the grounds appear in the 2007 film St Trinian's. In June 2007 the house was sold to Michael Spink, a founder and owner of SPINK, for ¬£42 million, which made it the most expensive house sale in the United Kingdom outside London at that time. Spink spent two years restoring the gardens and the main house. Park Place was sold to Russian businessman Andrey Borodin, for a further record of ¬£140 million, making it the most expensive house sale in the United Kingdom, in 2012.\\"Russian Banker buys ¬£140m Henley Pile\\", Sunday Times, p. 13, 5 August 2012 Spink retained for further development.

According to various interviews, it was written by Roger Waters as a declaration of love to his new wife Carolyne Christie. The song is significantly different from the other three songs on the album, \\"Dogs,\\" \\"Pigs\\" and \\"Sheep,\\" in that the other songs are dark, whereas this one is lighter-themed, as well as also being much shorter in duration, at under a minute and a half while the others are all at least 10 minutes in length. The title is a reference to the figure of speech \\"when pigs fly\\" and an image of a flying pig appears on the album cover and was subsequently used by Pink Floyd in their live concerts. Composition The song is divided into two parts, which are the first and last tracks of the album. Both are in stark contrast to the album's middle three songs. Without the including this track on Animals, Waters thought the album \\"would have just been a kind of scream of rage.\\" According to Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason, and confirmed by Waters, it is a love song directed towards Waters' new wife at the time, Carolyne. She was really the only one of Waters' friends Mason had ever met who could hold her own in an argument with Waters. According to Mason, someone had to be very good with semantics to win an argument against Waters. Waters wrote the song because that is what he had been looking for all along: someone who could stand up to him, an equal. The songs are constructed simply and feature no instrumentation besides a strummed acoustic guitar played by Waters. A special version of the song was made for the 8-track cartridge release. The 8-track format featured a loop-play function where the end of the cassette was looped with the beginning of the cassette, allowing an album to play continuously without having to turn over the cassette. To exploit this feature, the special 8-track version of the song linked part 2 and part 1 with a guitar solo, performed by Snowy White, who would later play the guitar solo in live performances on the 1977 In the Flesh Tour. The complete version of the song, including the instrumental bridge, was re- released on White's Goldtop compilation album in 1995. Reception In a review for Animals, Brice Ezell of Consequence of Sound described \\"Pigs on the Wing (Part One)\\" as \\"a brief acoustic framing device. Its major key signature is a clear contrast to the frequently sinister riffs that form the landscape of \\"Dogs,\\" \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" and \\"Sheep.\\" \\" Ezell would describe \\"Part Two\\" as \\"a reminder that humans find ways to stick together even amidst the turmoil of a cravenly capitalist world.\\" Personnel * Roger Waters ‚Äì acoustic guitar, lead vocals * Snowy White ‚Äì electric guitar solo (8-track version only) See also *when pigs fly References ;Footnotes ;Bibliography  External links Category:Pink Floyd songs Category:1977 songs Category:Folk rock songs Category:Songs written by Roger Waters Category:Song recordings produced by David Gilmour Category:Song recordings produced by Roger Waters Category:Song recordings produced by Richard Wright (musician) Category:Song recordings produced by Nick Mason Category:Harvest Records singles ","title":"Pigs on the Wing"},{"id":"4501968","text":"The General People's Congress of Libya (Mu'tammar al-sha'ab al '√¢mm) () was the national legislature of Muammar Gaddafi's Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya governance structure.

Originally conceived in Michael Muhammad Knight's 2003 novel, The Taqwacores, the name is a portmanteau of \\"hardcore\\" and the Arabic word \\"taqwa\\" (ÿ™ŸÇŸàŸâ‚Äé), which is usually translated as \\"piety\\" or the quality of being \\"God-fearing\\", and thus roughly denotes reverence and love of the divine. The scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the US and other Western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam, and thus live their own lifestyle within the religion or without. History Muslim punk music dates at least to the 1979 founding of British band Alien Kulture. In the 1990s, Nation Records act Fun- Da-Mental and Asian Dub Foundation emerged solidifying the first examples of UK Muslim generated punk. In an interview, Aki Nawaz, founder of Nation Records, stated that \\"Islam for me was more punk than punk\\" Knight's novel was instrumental in encouraging the growth of a contemporary North American Muslim punk movement, and many bands who used the term taqwacore were ones that traveled with Knight on the ISNA tour featured in the documentary. Thus, the taqwacore community is almost inseparable with Knight and his literature. The first bands to use the term taqwacore are The Kominas, Vote Hezbollah and the Sagg Taqwacore Syndicate. Other bands on the scene include, Secret Trial Five, Fedayeen, Sarmust, KBhttps://myspace.com/mahditaquacorekb/ and other bands under SG-Records. When Kourosh Poursalehi first read The Taqwacores, he took it to be a true account of real Muslims in the United States. He composed a song to Michael Muhammad Knights poem \\"Muhammad was a Punk Rocker\\", and sent it to Knight in New York. Knight was extremely happy with what he heard, knowing that his book had reached real Muslims similar to himself, and he played the song on repeat over and over. They ended up meeting in Boston, where with Basim Usmani, the Kominas were formed, and the seeds of their tour were planted. Pourlaselhi was heavily influenced by the Fearless Iranians from Hell, as he was from the San Antonio area, and the band was also from Texas. He later went on to form the band Vote Hezbollah. A group of self-identified taqwacore bands traveled in a caravan style tour around the United States as a sort of self re-creation of Michael Muhammad Knights original novel in 2007. This was the basis of the documentary on the movement. Bands that appeared in the film are as follows: The Kominas :*The Kominas members. The Kominas is a Pakistani punk band from the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. The members include Basim Usmani (bass and vocals), Shahjehan Khan (guitar and vocals), Arjun Ray (guitar and vocals), and Karna Ray (drums). Al Thawra :*Al-Thawra, a heavy metal Arab band from Chicago featuring Marwan :*Diacritical :*Vote Hezbollah, fronted by Kourosh, an Iranian from San Antonio :*Secret Trial Five, an all-female Canadian punk rock band fronted by Sena, a Pakistani lesbian from Vancouver Secret Trial Five, however, have stated that they do not associate themselves with taqwacore: Secret Trial Five There is not a definitive \\"taqwacore sound\\", and the scene is much more diverse now (2011) than the fictional one portrayed in Knight's novel, with artists incorporating various styles, ranging from punk to hip-hop, and musical traditions from the Muslim world; the Kominas describe their sound as \\"Bollywood punk\\", Sagg Taqwacore Syndicate are rap and techno inspired music while Al-Thawra uses the term \\"raicore\\", based on North African Arabic Ra√Ø music. The genre of music is much more specific to topics of consideration, self-labeling, political framework, and ideology.  In popular culture  The Taqwacore genre was popularized through different forms of media, starting with Michael Muhammad Knight's novel The Taqwacores, which extended through his other works as well as different bands, films adaptations, and events. Michael Muhammad Knight continued his penmanship through his other novels including Blue Eyed Devil, The Five Percenters, Osama Van Halen, Impossible Man, Journey to the End of Islam, Why I am a Five Percenter, and his future book titled William S. Burroughs vs. the Qur'an. After gaining international popularity, a documentary was produced by Omar Majeed following Michael Muhammad Knight and a group of taqwacore bands on their tour across the United State, and eventually Pakistan. A film by Eyad Zahra was released in 2010 under the same title. The film starred actress Noureen DeWulf. The Kominas appeared in the film Slackistan, which was later banned in Pakistan.  Links to the novel  The Taqwacores is about punk Islam where Michael Muhammad Knight imagined a community of Muslim radicals: mohawked Sufis, riot grrrls in burqas with band patches, skinhead Shi‚Äôas, but did not limit the term taqwacore to only these groups. The concept of an individual's Islam is historically popular with Sufism and was solidified in a new American style with the publication of Michael Muhammad Knight's novel. The novel focus's on a household of individual \\"punk\\" characters who live their lives according to their own interpretation of Islam. One fictitious character in the novel named Fasiq, an Indonesian Muslim, openly smokes cannabis while reading the Quran. His personal interpretation of Surat Al-Hijr is that the smoking of cannabis is permissible in Islam. Ayats 19 and 20 state: In the novel, Fasiq determines that since Allah sent down everything that is well balanced, and that humans can use them, cannabis is well balanced and permissible. Many band members in the recent documentary Taqwacore: The Birth of Punk Islam can be seen smoking hashish while in Pakistan.  Disenchantment  With bands reporting disenchantment with the role of taqwacore in their lives, the author himself wrote of confusion and self disenchantment in his book titled \\"Osama Van Halen\\" where he writes himself as a fictional character. : \\"Michael Muhammad Knight then looked at Amazing Ayyub and immediately, clearly, understood him to be the last lonely survivor of an extinct race\\" : \\"Amazing Ayyub made his niyya, read Ya Sin, and vanished. Beyond its function as an invisibility spell, Ya Sin doubled as a prayer for the dead and dying.\\" The disenchantment and desire to reach a conclusion or catharsis of creating a personal Islam for Michael Muhammad Knight started with his Taqwacore project. The extreme nature of his fictional characters spoke to young Muslims around the world, and sparked a movement of \\"Taqwacore\\" labeled bands. Although some bands were happy to be labeled as such, and others did reluctantly, the labeling of a punk band led to problems, much like any labeling can lead to problems. The Kominas, while still labeled taqwacore, have expressed discontent with their reviews focusing on the Muslim aspect of their music instead of aesthetics or politics. The all-female punk band Secret Trial Five wrote a song dedicated to their hate of the term Taqwacore, titled \\"We're not Taqwacore\\" and can be heard on stage at one performance calling Taqwacore \\"bullshit\\", although many of their messages are consistent with the Taqwacore movement. Their lyrics read: :rather hang with taliban :than dick around with drunks :muhammad wasn't white :and neither is this fight :and we weren't birthed :by michael knight After Knight's novel that experimented in his self-beheading, his discontent was not an end for his exploration in individualistic Islam Knight's personal disenchantment came to a catharsis in his latest book Why I am a Five Percenter. In a public lecture at the University of Texas, he spoke of how his personal research in the community of the Five Percenter's led him to become a part of their community. This history of the Five Percenters allows him to feel empowered in his personal interpretation of Islam. He writes about his \\"conversion\\" and experiences in the community in his book.  Themes  Taqwacore as coined had a definite bond with Islam, Progressive Islam and Islam and Anarchism. Many of the members of Taqwacore bands are Muslims, through their own interpretations of the religion. Some members, however, are not Muslim. The overarching theme of individual interpretation, as well as a break from Imams, Mainstream Islam, and Classical interpretations of the Qur'an are very prevalent in the music, yet some bands have bent or broken this initial tie with the overarching theme of Taqwacore, as their music deals with more issues than simply Islamic interpretation. Much of Taqwacore is rooted in the spirit of Punk: that of rebellion, political commentary, and activism. The Kominas are one of the most famous taqwacore bands, and they have reached the digital ears of people all over the world, and have become interests of many academic articles and press. Wendy Hsu writes that \\"Over- emphasizing the band members as ‚ÄúMuslim‚Äù, the press has overlooked the non- Islamic sides of the band‚Äôs music, image, and membership.\\" She also writes that taqwacore is not limited to music but is \\"forming a network of friends, artists, bloggers, filmmakers, and other enthusiasts around the self- identified label of taqwacore.\\" The bands political messages are also linked with cultural questions, multiculturalism, and the interaction of the east and the west. Al-Thawra initially labeled themselves as \\"raicore\\", yet another portmanteau combining North African and Algerian ra√Ø music and hardcore. He talks about his music and its cultural considerations, linking the ways in which Algerian Chaabi music can be considered rebel music, much like punk itself. Fun-Da-Mental are an explicitly political and controversial band with an outspoken concern with social justice (particularly in regard to Britain's treatment of its Asian and Afro-Caribbean citizens) and have been described as \\"articulat(ing) eclectically a kind of militant Islamic-influenced, pro-Black anti-racist identity politics.\\" \\"Vote Hezbollah does not promote violence or support any violent organizations. Peace, unity, and truth are our only strengths.‚Äù Controversy Knight is criticized for his participation in provocative articles, disrespectful attitude toward leaders of the American Muslim community, open admission of past apostasy (chronicled in his essay \\"Forget what is and is not Islam\\" in Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out), heretical attitudes, embrace of the Nation of Islam and Nation of Gods and Earths and often rebellious treatment of Muhammad. Knight developed a reputation for his Muslim WakeUp! articles, particularly accounts of the Islamic Society of North America's annual convention, in which he wrote of giving a \\"stink palm\\" to famous imam Siraj Wahhaj and Cat Stevens and engaging in a romantic encounter with a young Muslim woman. At the 2005 convention of the Islamic Society of North America, Knight and the Kominas fraudulently obtained media passes and sneaked into the press conference of Karen Hughes, Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs in the U.S. Department of State. They were taken outside and questioned by a State Department agent, but allowed back in by ISNA officials. It was later learned that the ISNA staff was concerned over Knight's jacket bearing the Alternative Tentacles logo. During the Taqwacore tour that is featured in the documentary film, the group ended at the annual ISNA convention in Chicago. They played on stage using forged media passes at an open mic event. When viewed in the film, many of the younger audience at first were confused, but later cheered for the bands. When the all-female band Secret Trial Five played on stage, security was called and the group was forced off stage. This was due to the ISNA convention rules of \\"no-female singers\\". The ragged group gathered outside of the building and broke a guitar on the pavement. The taqwacore groups also dealt with discrimination on the road of their tour. Other drivers flipped them off, or cursed at them. The taqwacore groups thus responded to their alienation, both from the Muslim community and from without. The Kominas performed songs with controversial lyrics such as \\"suicide bomb the gap,\\" and \\"Rumi was a homo.\\" These were comments on social issues that spread through both the Muslim community and outside of the community in America. The latter was a commentary on an Anti-Gay Imam from Brooklyn. The musicians also started a joke band named \\"Box Cutter Surprise\\", referencing the knives used to hijack planes on September 11. Marwan Kamel, from a band on tour called Al-Thawra, Arabic for \\"revolution,\\" said that the members created the group to shock audiences. These sentiments were also fueled by Knight's original desire to \\"find what people are pissed about and talk about it\\".  In academia  The social movement linked with Knight's novels as well as the musical subculture raised great interest in the academic world. Along with punk, the subgenre has been a subject of cultural studies, religious studies, and more. The novel has allegedly been taught at a number of university courses. Michael Muhammad Knight also gives public lectures from time to time on the varying subjects of his books, most recently (2011) on his book that deals with the history of the Five Percenters. Many academic articles, dissertations and masters theses have been written on the topic. In heavy metal Islam: rock, resistance, and the struggle for the soul of Islam , Mark Levine writes about the relationship of heavy metal and Islam and its history. While not the same specific genre of music, the book covers a wide variety of topics and talks about crowds at shows \\"dressed in strange combinations of metal, hip-hop, and punk attire.\\" His book addresses the issues that arise with the combination of two seemingly separate cultures, in vivid imagery. He says that \\"one can see a teenager with green spiky hair and baggy hip-hop style clothing standing next to one in goth makeup, and a few feet away yet another in a black metal T-shirt who‚Äôs watching the show with his mother or aunt who may be dressed in a black, full- length abaya.\\" An abaya is a traditional cloak, or over garment worn in the Arab world by women for modesty, and also worn in different styles. Another paper written by a number of masters students at the Roskilde University write in Looking for Cultural Space Discourses of Identity Formation on the case of Taqwacore, on populations, groups, and individuals belonging in society. They write about a sense of belonging and how identity is formed in relation to the taqwacore movement, stating that \\"the questions of social inclusion or exclusion have raised new lines of connection within societies\\" and that this happens more often when individuals \\"sense of belonging transcends national borders linking to other cultural and social geographies and groupings\\", which is an essential theme in taqwacore music and the taqwacore movement. Many ideas of belonging to more than one culture is presented in taqwacore music through satire or dark humor. In Abraham Ibrahim's work on the Queer community of Muslims, ‚ÄúSodomized by Religion‚Äù: Fictional Representations of Queer Muslims in the West, he explores different representations of characters that have been systematically oppressed by the orthodox Islamic community. He writes about a few different works, including Michael Muhammad Knight's work \\"Bilal's Bread\\" and a film titled A Touch of Pink he writes that \\"the security concerns about Muslims in the West are remarkably similar to the suspicions about homosexuals: they are not ‚Äútrue‚Äù members of the community, and they are quite possibly in league with foreign subversives\\" Francis Stewart explores the role of punk in spiritual life in her article ‚ÄúPunk Rock Is My Religion‚Äù An Exploration of Straight Edge punk as a Surrogate of Religion. She questions the role of the Straight Edge music ideology in individuals lives, and how it potentially may relate to the taqwacore movement. As one fictional character in the novel was a Straight Edge rocker, many of the real life musicians involved in the taqwacore scene are as well. She writes about the differences between their lifestyle and traditionally proscribed Islamic lifestyles staying that \\"as with many within hardcore and Straight Edge the religion that is practiced or found amongst individuals within Taqwacore is not that proscribed by or expected within Islamic dogma.\\" Their lifestyles are personalized, \\"touring bands do not perform salat five times day and although shows will open with a communal prayer, it is men and women praying together so constitutes haram.\\" Their actions are often the opposite of orthodox Islam. Some may be straight edge, which may be in accordance with traditional Islam, but some \\"will drink and smoke\\" and perform other acts that may be considered forbidden or \\"haram\\" in Islam, \\"Yet they still consider themselves Muslim‚Äôs and some would even describe themselves as religious Muslims.\\" In Abdou Mohamad's masters thesis for Queen's University titled \\"ANARCA-ISLAM\\", he explores what he considers to be a close knit relationship between Islam, Islamic law, and Anarchism. Anarchism has historically been associated with the punk movement, and is a reoccurring slogan in many punk rock, hardcore, and metal songs. Abdou observes that \\"as taken from academic texts by non- Muslims, is the recognition that resonances exist between Islam and anarchism.\\" He considers the two as \\"not identical, but neither are they necessarily incompatible.\\" John Hutnyk writes more specifically about the band that is considered to be taqwacore by some Fun-Da-Men-Tal in \\"THE DIALECTICS OF EUROPEAN HIP-HOP: Fun^da^mental and the deathening silence.\\" In his article, Hutnyk writes about the role of hip-hop and Islam in a political agenda within the musical world. He writes that \\"The politics of Fun^da^mental is the politics of hip-hop, crossed with a punk Islam\\" and that the messages that are presented in their music encapsulate many different issues. These include \\"interventions around race and representation\\", the historic and recent deciding factor that started \\"the war of ‚Äòterror‚Äô\\", as well as what he calls \\"a radical version of human rights activism.\\" Amil Khan addresses similar issues, but on a wider spectrum in his book titled The Long Struggle: The Seeds of the Muslim World's Frustration. In his book, he writes, similar to other authors, about the Conversation and relationship between orthodox Islam, westernization, and the results of such. He comments on the orthodox community, arguing that \\"Even within the most orthodox communities, groups are taking up differing positions on various points, like the use of violence or the interaction between Muslims and non-Muslims\\", showing that a conversation exists even in what many view as a succinct group. He shows that what some Muslims call the Ummah, or the unified Muslim world, is in fact extremely divided. He says that when Muslims gather at different events, \\"the audience at any of these events includes the most obviously observant in traditional robes, city workers in neat trim beards, punk rock Muslim teenagers and the merely curious\\", showing the multitude of lifestyles amongst Muslims.

It consists of four books that describe how to interpret and teach the Scriptures. The first three of these books were published in 397 and the fourth added in 426. By writing this text, Augustine set three tasks for Christian teachers and preachers: to discover the truth in the contents of the Scriptures, to teach the truth from the Scriptures, and to defend scriptural truth when it was attacked. Historical context Starting in AD 389, the powerful application of faith to politics led Emperor Theodosius to issue a series of edicts against paganism that concluded in 391 with a law making pagan worship illegal. During the Golden Age of Athens, politics and man-made laws guided human conduct, and the city-state was viewed as a manifestation of the highest human values, giving rise to political philosophy. Christianity effected a change in the course of Western society, requiring a new cultural identity and a new educational curriculum. With this aim in mind, Emperor Justinian (AD 483‚Äì565) cut off all state funding to chairs of rhetoric, essentially bringing the pagan classical tradition to a close. The classical heritage was from this time onward viewed through the lens of Christianity, increasing the need for an approach to the teaching of scripture that matched the sophistication of the classical inheritance. De doctrina Christiana supplied the medieval world with that tool.As noted by John C. Cavadini, in his article \\"St. Augustine of Hippo\\" in The Encyclopedia of Catholicism, p. 128. Summary Prologue The Prologue consists of a response to those who would resist Augustine's project of providing rules for interpretation of the Scriptures. Augustine outlines three possible objections, including those who do not understand his precepts, those who fail to make effective use of his teachings, and those who believe they are already prepared to interpret the Scriptures. To the first two types of critics, Augustine states that he cannot be held responsible for their inability to understand. He then addresses the third type of critic, those who believe they are already able to interpret the Scriptures. If their claims are true, he acknowledges that they have received a great blessing. However, they must admit that language itself was learned from a human being, not directly from God. Therefore, God has created human beings to learn from one another, and we ought to learn with humility. All good teaching from human beings derives ultimately from God. The ability to understand obscurity is therefore both the gift of God and reinforced by human teaching. Book One Book One discusses enjoyment, use, interpretation, and the relation of various Christian doctrines to these concepts. Augustine begins with a discussion of the steps in the interpretive process: discovery of what is to be understood, and a way of teaching what has been discovered. He then expands upon the Platonic notion that there are things and signs. Signs are used to symbolize things, but are considered things themselves because they too represent meaning. They are given meaning through their repetition and propagation throughout society. Some things are to be enjoyed (in Latin, frui), and others are to be used (uti). Things we enjoy are those we find good in themselves, and things we use are those that are good for the sake of something else. The only thing that is to be enjoyed is God. All other things, including other human beings, are to be used in relation to the proper end of enjoyment. To use something which is to be enjoyed or vice versa is to fail to love properly. The discussion of enjoyment and use leads to an extended reflection on motivation, word as flesh, and humanity as image of God. Book One concludes with a discussion of love: how humans ought to love God, how God's love is expressed in his use of humanity, and how people may appreciate God's love through the Scriptures, faith, and charity. Augustine also claims that those who think they understand the Scriptures, but do not interpret them to reflect charity and love, do not really understand them.On love and interpretation in De doctrina Christiana, see Book Two Book Two discusses the types of unknown signs present in the world and defines each and presents methods for understanding the Scriptures. Obscure signs include unknown literal signs and unknown figurative signs. Unknown signs are those that have meanings that are unknown. Augustine says that a feature of the Scriptures is obscurity and that obscurity is the result of sin: that is, God made the Scriptures obscure in order to motivate and challenge our fallen minds. Augustine claims there are seven steps to wisdom in interpretation of the Scriptures: fear of God, holiness and faith, scientia (or knowledge), strength, good counsel, purity of heart, and then wisdom. He also distinguishes \\"truth\\" from \\"logic\\", and argues that logic can lead to falsehood. He declares that it is better to have truth than logic. Augustine argues that committing the Scriptures to memory is critical to understanding. Once the reader is \\"familiar with the language of Scripture,\\" it is possible for him to try to untangle sections that are obscure. He also emphasizes studying the Scriptures in their original languages to avoid the problems of imperfect and divergent translations. Throughout Book Two, Augustine stresses the importance of method as well as virtue for attaining wisdom through the Scriptures. He analyzes sources of knowledge, reason, and eloquence as well as charity and humility. In chapter 8, Augustine discusses the canon of the Bible. In determining which books to include, he writes: \\"Now in regard to the canonical Scriptures, [an interpreter] must follow the judgment of the greater number of Catholic Churches; and among these, of course a high place must be given to such as have been thought worthy to be the seat of an apostle and to receive epistles.\\" For the Old Testament, he lists 44 books. For the New Testament, he lists the 27 books of the contemporary canon. He writes that there are \\"fourteen epistles of the Apostle Paul,\\" including the epistle to the Hebrews. Augustine's list is the same as the Canon approved by the third Synod of Carthage (397 CE), and it is possible that he might have played a role in the synod's decision on the canon. Book Three Book Three discusses how to interpret ambiguous literal and ambiguous figurative signs. Ambiguous signs are those whose meaning is unclear or confused. He suggests first determining things from signs. Then, once the distinction is made, understand the literal meaning of the text (things as things, nothing more). Determining if there is a deeper meaning in the text can be done by recognizing a different, more figurative, mode of writing. This may show that the things are also signs of something else. For example, an aged tree could be a literal tree or it could be a symbol of long life (as a sign or allegory). Augustine emphasizes right motives when interpreting scripture, and claims that it is more important to build up love than to arrive at a historically or literally accurate interpretation. He also stresses that contemporary readers must be careful to understand that some actions (i.e., having multiple wives) which were acceptable among the ancients are no longer acceptable, and must therefore be interpreted figuratively. Understanding tropes such as irony and antiphrasis will also be beneficial for interpretation. The final section of Book Three is one of Augustine's late additions to the work (with Book Four), consisting of Tyconius‚Äôs seven rules for interpreting scripture: The Lord and His Body, The Twofold Division of the Body of the Lord, The Promises and the Law (or The Spirit and the Letter), Species and Genus, Times, Recapitulation, and The Devil and His Body.Green, R.P.H. Introduction to De doctrina Christiana, Oxford University Press, 1995, xviii. Book Four Book Four discusses the relationship between Christian truth and rhetoric, the importance of eloquence, and the role of the preacher. This book was appended to the work a number of years after its original composition, along with the end of Book Three.Green 1995, xii-xiv. Augustine again stresses the importance of both discovery and teaching for the interpretation of Scripture. He cautions the reader that he will not discuss the rules of rhetoric here; for though they are acceptable and useful for the Christian speaker, they can easily be learned elsewhere. Though eloquence is a skill which can be used for good or evil, it should be used in service to wisdom. It is not necessary, then, for the preacher to be eloquent, but only wise. Nonetheless, eloquence can enhance one's ability to teach wisdom. The proper goal of rhetoric should thus be to teach wisdom by the use of eloquence. Augustine then analyzes the relationship between eloquence and teaching, including various stylistic points, a discussion of inspiration, and the claim that eloquence and teaching are both to be valued. Drawing on Cicero,Baldwin, Charles Sears. \\"St, Augustine on Preaching (De doctrina Christiana, IV).\\" The Rhetoric of St. Augustine of Hippo: De doctrina Christiana and the Search for a Distinctly Christian Rhetoric. Ed. Richard Leo Enos and Roger Thompson, et al. Baylor University Press, 2008, 187-203. Augustine outlines three types of style‚Äîsubdued style, moderate style, and grand style‚Äîand discusses the proper context for each. The use of these styles must be determined by subject matter as well as the audience. Finally, Augustine concludes by considering the importance of the preacher's life, which is more important than eloquence for persuading the audience. In this regard, things (the preacher's actions) are more important than signs (the preacher's words). Prayer is essential in order to receive from God the wisdom which will be passed on to the audience. The text concludes with an injunction to humility and thanks to God that Augustine has been able to discuss these topics.This summary is based upon the most recent English translation: Augustine. De doctrina Christiana. Trans. R.P.H. Green. Oxford University Press, 1995. Connections to Augustine, Cicero, and classical rhetoric in Book Four Book Four of De doctrina Christiana has sparked a great deal of debate among scholars with regards to the extent to which Augustine's work has been influenced by the rules and traditions of classical rhetoric, and more specifically by the writings of Cicero. In the final chapter of On Christian Doctrine, Augustine uses much of Cicero's rhetorical theory as he lays down the foundation for the proper use of rhetoric by Christian teachers. For example, Augustine quotes Cicero (Orat. 21. 69.) when he writes, ‚Äúa certain eloquent man said, and said truly, that he who is eloquent should speak in such a way that he teaches, delights, and moves.‚Äù Some scholars claim that Book Four of this text has been greatly influenced by both Ciceronian and classical rhetoric. In his introduction to one edition of On Christian Doctrine, D.W. Robertson Jr. states that ‚Äúthe allegorical interpretation of literature itself was a classical practice.‚Äù At the same time, others have argued that St. Augustine is instead, ‚Äúwriting against the tradition of classical rhetoric.‚Äù One academic, Stanley Fish, has even gone so far as to claim that ‚ÄúAugustine effectively declares the speaker irrelevant as well when he tells would-be preachers to pray for God to put good speeches in their mouths (38). In recent years, a number of scholars have made a concerted effort to achieve some degree of compromise or middle ground within this heated debate. Celica Milovanovic-Barham wrote an article in which she acknowledged this contention, and attempted to argue several places in the text where Augustine agrees or disagrees with Cicero‚Äôs rhetorical theories. The article analyzes Augustine‚Äôs use of ciceronian rhetoric through his discussion of Cicero‚Äôs three levels of style: plain, middle, and grand. Although Augustine begins Book Four by asserting that wisdom and clarity are far more important in the rhetoric of a Christian teacher, he also acknowledges the power of style and eloquence in connecting with an audience and in persuading the people to act according to Christian law and teachings. According to Barham, this is where Augustine ‚Äúquotes Cicero‚Äôs very words: ‚Äòhe, then, shall be eloquent, who can say little things in a subdued style, moderate things in a temperate style, and great things in a majestic style.‚Äô‚Äù However, Barham is also quick to note that, ‚ÄúAugustine, after all, does not completely agree with his famous predecessor,‚Äù in that, he believes that for Christian teachers, nothing they preach would be considered a ‚Äòlittle thing.‚Äô As a result, Barham argues that Augustine is advocating for alternating and blending the various ‚Äòstyles‚Äô of rhetoric all within a single speech. She explains that by combining these three different styles, Augustine believes the speaker is able to produce a more powerful speech by delivering the necessary information in a clear and accurate way, while he is also able to connect with the audience's emotions through the more grand and passionate style. John D. Schaeffer claims that Augustine's writings should not be analyzed at all from the same perspective as the classical rhetoricians, because his works were produced in an entirely different era and for an entirely different group of people than those of the great classical rhetoricians.Schaeffer, John D. \\"The Dialectic of Orality and Literacy: The Case of Book 4 of Augustine's De doctrina Christiana.\\" PMLA 111.5 (1996): 1133-145. Web. The issue for Schaeffer lies in the fact that Augustine was trying to bring together the elements of orality and the Christian religion, which was founded primarily upon the written scriptures and called for private introspection and prayer. Schaeffer says, ‚Äúbook 4 attempts to resolve a central paradox of early Christianity by synthesizing the oral world of public performance with a religion grounded in writing and addressed to the inner person‚Ä¶De doctrina presents Augustine‚Äôs attempt to bring classical rhetoric‚Ä¶to bear on Christian preaching.‚Äù Therefore, he argues that Augustine was not simply writing against the traditions of classical rhetoric and that scholars should consider Augustine's work within its own context.

It has 45 members, 44 elected for a four-year term in 23 single-seat and multi-seat constituencies and 1 delegate from the Banaban community on Rabi Island in Fiji (chosen by the Rabi Council of Leaders). If the Attorney general was not elected as MP, he or she has been an ex-officio member of it, from 1979 to 2016, when a change of the constitution modified this provision. Created by the Constitution of 12 July 1979, in a Westminster system, its seat has been at Ambo in South Tarawa since October 2000. From 1979 to 2000, it was at Bairiki, where the House of Assembly was created in 1974, on the base of the Legislative Council of the British colony, created in 1970. History An order in council of 1970 created a Legislative Council of 28 elected members, replacing the former House of Representatives of the colony. This Council was elected only in 1971. A new constitution entered into effect on 1 May 1974, creating a House of Assembly of 28 members from the previous Legislative Council of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony (1970). The 8 members of the Ellice Islands created an Ellice committee and, after referendum, left the House of Assembly on 1 January 1976 to become the Fale i Fono on Funafuti, the new capital of Tuvalu. The first specific to Gilbert Islands House of Assembly was so created on 1 January 1976, just after the separation with the Ellice Islands, decided on 1st October 1975, to prepare the following independence of Kiribati and the Constitution of 12th July 1979. The former House of Assembly took its new constitutional name of Maneaba ni Maungatabu on 12 July 1979. The House of Assembly continued until independence when it became the Maneaba ni Maungatabu with 35 elected members, one nominated member (from Rabi) and one ex-officio member (the Attorney-General). The total number of elected members has, at the 2007 elections, increased to 44 making a 46 member unicameral parliament. In 2016, a modified constitution had suppressed the Ex-officio member with the creation of a new Ministry of Justice. Attorney general, former ex-officio member Since October 2016, Honourable Ms Tetiro Semilota is the Attorney General of Kiribati. She is no more Ex-officio member of the House of Assembly since. Speaker The Maneaba has a Speaker, elected by its members from outside Parliament, per section 71 of the Constitution. At the first parliamentary session following a general election, the Chief Justice presides over the Maneaba to take nominations for the office of Speaker. Voting is done by secret ballot, and a candidate must receive an absolute majority of votes cast to be elected. Should more than two candidates be nominated, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated after each round of voting until one candidate wins. The Speaker of the Maneaba does not have a vote on any matter. Should a vote result in a tie, the Speaker has to declare it as rejected. Following the dissolution of the legislature before elections, the Speaker remains in office. On the first day of a new session, the Speaker leaves office. The Maneaba may also pass a no-confidence vote against the Speaker to remove him from office. Along with the Chief Justice and Chairman of the Public Service Commission, the Speaker serves as a member of the Council of State, formed to continue carrying out the duties of government following a no-confidence vote against the President or Government.

Uroscopy is the historical medical practice of visually examining a patient's urine for pus, blood, or other symptoms of disease. The first records of uroscopy as a method for determining symptoms of an illness date back to the 4th millennium BC, and became common practice in Classical Greece. Later reaching medical predominance during the Byzantine Era & High Middle Ages, the practice eventually was replaced with more accurate methods during the early modern period, with uroscopy being considered inadequate due to the lack of empirical evidence and higher standards of post-Renaissance medicine. In modern medicine, visual examination of a patient's urine may provide preliminary evidence for a diagnosis, but is generally limited to conditions that specifically affect the urinary system such as urinary tract infections, kidney and bladder issues, and liver failure. It is notable that pregnancy and diabetes are two diagnoses that uroscopy, although out of favor with medical professionals, has a good rate of predicting.  History  Records of urinalysis for uroscopy date back as far as 4000 BC, originating with Babylonian and Sumerian physicians. At the outset of the 4th century BC Greek physician Hippocrates hypothesized that urine was a \\"filtrate\\" of the four humors, and limited possible the diagnoses resulting from this method to issues dealing with the bladder, kidneys, and urethra. This in turn led another Greek physician, Galen, to refine the idea down to urine being a filtrate of only blood, and not of black bile, yellow bile, or phlegm. Byzantine medicine followed, though it maintained its roots from Greco-Roman antiquity, and continued the application and study of uroscopy ‚Äî it eventually becoming the primary form of ailment diagnosis. Byzantine physicians created some of the foundational codifications of uroscopy, with the most well known example being a 7th-century guide on uroscopic methods: Theophilus Protospatharius's On Urines. The work, along with others, became widely popular and accelerated the rate at which uroscopy spread throughout the Mediterranean. Over time these Byzantine works inspired further interpretation by other prominent culture's scholars (like the Arab Jewish Isaac Israeli ben Solomon and his urine-hue classification chart), though greater propagation led to a widened application of uroscopy and eventually uroscopic diagnoses of non-urinary related diseases and infections became standard. Pivotal in the spread of uroscopy, Constantine the African's Latin translations of Byzantine and Arab texts inspired a new era in uroscopic interest specifically in western Europe throughout the High Middle Ages. Despite this popularization, uroscopy was still mostly maintained by the principals Hippocrates's and Galen's first postulated, aided by Byzantine interpretations that were further disseminated during this period in works by French physicians of the era Bernard de Gordon and Gilles de Corbeil. The practice was upheld as the standard until the beginning of the 16th century, when influence from cultural movements like the Renaissance inspired the re-examination of its methods, both to re-evaluate its effectiveness and explore new applications. During this period, a lack of empirical evidence supporting uroscopy and the introduction of new medical practices developed using the scientific method contributed to its gradual decline among licensed physicians. Early modern doctors, like the Swiss medical pioneer Paracelsus, began researching more empirically qualified approaches to diagnosis and treatment ‚Äî an integral part of the Medical Renaissance and its redefining how we look at medicine ‚Äîwhich only further hastened the decline of uroscopy. Since the beginning of the 17th century the practice has been largely considered unverifiable and unorthodox, and became a subject of satire (including multiple satirical references in the plays of Shakespeare). It was still practiced by \\"unlicensed practitioners\\" by popular demand up until around the beginning of the 19th century. Though uroscopy is no longer popular in modern medicine, examples of its preliminary diagnostic utility still exist in simplified and empirically proven forms. Incidentally, as the decline of uroscopy continued a new form of divination emerged from its remnants in \\"Uromancy\\" ‚Äî the analysis of one's urine for fortune-telling or state-reading purposes. Although uromancy initially gained interest in the 18th and 19th centuries, it is rarely practiced and unknown to most in the present era. Procedures and conventions The Medical Alchemist vt. The Uroscopy by Franz Christoph Janneck (1703-1761), (Science History Institute)Practitioners of uroscopy are referred to as uroscopists. In the era in which uroscopy was a popular way of thinking, one of the major benefits was the lack of surgical operations, lending itself to the most conservative of adherents to the Hippocratic Oath. Matula (flask) A uroscopy flask, also known as a \\"matula\\", is a piece of transparent glass ‚Äî this is imperative as colorations, along with any deformations, in the glass may lead to a missdiagnosis ‚Äî that is circular at the bottom, while there is a thin neck at the top, and an opening for the patient to urinate in. Urine wheel Uroscopy Wheel The uroscopy wheel is a diagram that linked the color of urine to a particular disease. It usually has twenty different uroscopy flasks with urine of different colors aligned around the border of the circle. Each flask has a line that connects it to a summary of a particular disease. This allowed doctors to have a quick reference guide to twenty different types of urine. Temperature The temperature at which the urine is examined is a very important factor to consider in the process of uroscopy. When a patient urinates, the urine will be warm, so it is necessary for it to stay warm for proper evaluation. The external temperature should be the same as the internal temperature. When the temperature of urine goes down the bubbles in it will change. Some of them will disappear, but some will remain. With the temperature decrease particles and impurities will be more difficult to evaluate. They will move toward the middle of the flask, then sink to the bottom. They will all mix, making it more difficult to see the impurities. Another problem with urine cooling is that it would become thicker. The longer that it had to cool down the more likely it was that the crystals in the it would bond together, causing it to thicken. This could lead to a false diagnosis, that is why doctors usually inspected the urine quickly. Richard Bright in the 19th century A.D. invented a technique that allowed doctors to examine a patients urine effectively after the temperature had dropped. The process involved heating water, then inserting the uroscopy flask containing cooled urine. This would heat the urine causing the crystals that formed during loss of temperature to break down. As a result, the urine will become thin again. This process is very effective, but a doctor should ‚Äúalso be careful not to shake them much before you inspect them for you will move the particles and destroy the bubbles and dilute the deposits and confuse the situation,‚Äù (The Late Greco-Roman and Byzantine Contribution to the Evolution of Laboratory Examinations of Bodily Excrement. Part1: Urine, Sperm, Menses and Stools, Pavlos C. Goudas). Lighting Since identifying the color of the urine is essential for a proper diagnosis, the lighting is crucial. This is a very complicated step in the uroscopy test. The doctor must not visually examine the urine in an overly lit location, because it will make the urine seem too bright. He can not examine the urine in a poorly lit location, because he will not be able to properly see the urine. So, he must examine the urine in both conditions. This is done to offset the effects of not enough light and too much light. After he examines in both conditions the doctor must use his best judgment, to make a diagnosis. Common diseases identified by uroscopic methods Diabetes In 1674 English doctor Thomas Willis submitted into medical literature a peculiar (and peculiarly found) relationship he'd observed: people with type 1 diabetes usually have sweet tasting urine ‚Äî this is due to an oversaturation of glucose in the blood, the excess of which is excreted out via urine, as the diabetic lacks sufficient insulin to process the high amounts of glucose. Jaundice Yellowish discoloration of the whites of the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes caused by deposition of bilirubin in these tissues. It occurs as a symptom of various diseases, such as hepatitis, that affect the processing of bile. Also called Icterus. Doctors would test by using their vision. If the urine had a brownish tint then the patient would most likely have jaundice. Kidney disease The kidneys are supposed to filter excesses (especially urea) from the blood and excrete them, along with water, as urine. When they are not performing this task the patient is suffering from kidney disease. The medical field that studies the kidneys and diseases affecting the kidney is called nephrology, from the Ancient Greek name for kidney. Doctors would test urine using a visual examination. If the urine was red and/or foamy the patient was suffering from kidney disease.

It is the largest students' union in Ireland. The Union was founded in 1975 as the successor of the Student Representative Council, with Enda Connolly acting as the organisation's first president. Its primary role is to represent its members views and defend their interests. All students of UCD who are studying for a degree or postgraduate diploma of the National University of Ireland are, on registration at the university, members. The Union is funded by a membership fee paid at the same time as the student services levy (\\"registration fee\\") at the start of the academic year. In addition to its campaign work the Union also provides many services, such as three shops; welfare and education services such as an online second-hand bookshop; and the provision of a full-time accommodation officer. History The Union has been at the forefront of pushing social change in Ireland, selling condoms starting in 1979, when the sale of contraceptives without a prescription was still illegal. The Director of Public Prosecutions considered legal action against the Union but ultimately demurred, believing the Union was deliberately attempting to provoke a case and that the \\"clearly unconstitutional\\" 1935 law prohibiting their sale had \\"little or no chance of being upheld\\". The sale of contraceptives without a prescription was finally legalised in 1985, and their general sale legalised in 1993. The Union was also at the forefront of the fight for the right to publish information about abortion. In 1988, the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Spuc) threatened the Union with legal action if information on abortion was published in its welfare guide. The Union went ahead and published information on abortion clinics in Britain and a case was taken against it, Spuc v. Coogan, that was later joined by the Trinity College Student Union and Union of Students in Ireland in Spuc v. Grogan. The case was initially dismissed in the High Court on the basis that Spuc lacked standing but Spuc ultimately prevailed in the Supreme Court leaving the unions involved with large legal fees. The case ultimately as far as the European Court of Justice, which established that under the Treaty of Rome abortion was a service and a Member State could not prohibit the distribution of information about a service legally provided in another Member State. While establishing the principle that Ireland could not block the publication of abortion information from foreign clinics or their agents, the Court found it was legal for Ireland the block information from third parties, so establishing a principle of freedom of abortion information but ultimately finding against the students due to their status as unconnected third parties and leaving them with their costs. The provision of information on abortion services legally available in other European Union countries was ultimately legalised in the 1995 Abortion Information Act. In recent years the Union had serious financial problems due to mismanagement. A 2012 audit found shoddy financial practices devoid of checks and balances since 2007, racking up ‚Ç¨1.4m in debt including nearly ‚Ç¨400,000 in liability to the tax authorities, ultimately requiring a bailout from the University. Following this the Union incorporated as a limited liability company in 2012 and has recorded a steady income with a surplus in years since. The Union has had a rocky relationship with the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), disaffiliating and reaffiliating several times over the years. As of 2018, UCDSU is not affiliated with USI, having decided to leave in a referendum which was held in February 2013, 67% of students voted to leave the national union, reaffirming this in a 2016 with 74% of Students voting for UCDSU to remain outside of USI. Issues for un-affiliating and continuing to remain outside of USI cited included the ineffectual leadership of USI, transparency in USI operations and the large cost of affiliation which would amount to over ‚Ç¨100,000. UCDSU ceased being a member organisation on 1 July 2013. Structure The main governing body of UCDSU, subject only to referenda and General Meetings of the members of the Union, is the Union Council, which meets every second week of term. The Union Council is composed chiefly of the Class Representatives elected in their respective constituencies. These constituencies are elected at a flexible ratio, far lower than a previously arbitrary ratio of one representative per 125 students. The power of Union Council is conferred in a de facto manner on the Union Executive outside of term. The Union Executive, composed of all elected Union Sabbatical and non-Sabbatical Officers as well as the Union Secretary, meets weekly during term and fortnightly outside of it. There are four Sabbatical Officers, who are involved in the day-to-day running of the Union. The President and two nominated Vice-Presidents, as agreed by the Executive, are student representatives on the UCD Governing Authority. A Sabbatical term of office is twelve months in duration and commences on 1 July each year, although the incoming officers are, in accordance with the UCDSU Constitution, given job training by the incumbents from 15 June. Sabbatical elections take place in late February‚Äìearly March of each year. Sabbatical officers take a year out from academic studies and work full-time for the Union. The composition of the Union's Council includes a number of full-time elected Sabbatical Executive Officers, elected non-sabbatical Executive Officers, class representatives, campaign coordinators and an entertainments forum.

She was commissioned on 12 December 1957 and decommissioned in 1978. She was the second Royal Navy ship to be bear the name, and was named after Admiral Sir Pulteney Malcolm, who served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. The Cod Wars Just after she was commissioned, a dispute started in the North Atlantic. Relations between the United Kingdom and Iceland deteriorated and there was concern that the Landhelgisg√¶sla (the Icelandic Coast Guard) might threaten British fishermen. Landhelgisg√¶sla Malcolm joined the Fishery Patrol Squadron in April 1959, continuing on these duties until 1965. Malcolm was part of a five-ship group that was deployed to Iceland for fishery protection duties in what became known as the Cod Wars. She operated out of Edinburgh during the first Cod War, and from Rosyth after that. Malcolm was refitted at Rosyth from February 1965 until March 1966, when she rejoined the Fishery Patrol Squadron. In 1967 Malcolm joined the 20th Frigate Squadron based at Londonderry. Duties included training with submarines while continuing to carry out fishery protection patrols. In December 1970, Kevin McNamara MP raised concerns that Malcolm would not be replaced by another frigate after its return to home waters, stressing that Malcolms medical support was essential to fishing operations off Iceland. The Ministry of Defence decided not to replace Malcolm immediately, probably because the situation had calmed somewhat (1970 was between the first and second Cod Wars). Responsibility for supporting the fishing fleet was henceforth the Department of Trade and Industry's. The dispute ended in 1976. Two years later, Malcolm was decommissioned. She was considered too small to act as a modern frigate and therefore unable to continue service into the 1980s.

The Book of Prophecies (in Spanish, El Libro de las Profec√≠as) is a compilation of apocalyptical religious revelations written by Christopher Columbus towards the end of his life, probably with the assistance of his friend, the Carthusian monk Gaspar Gorricio. It was written between September 1501 and March 1502, with additions until about 1505.V.I.J. Flint, \\"Christopher Columbus,\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online, 5 Sep. 2010. This journal of sorts conveys the medieval notion that in order for the end of the world or the second coming of Jesus Christ to occur, certain events must first be enacted: # Christianity must be spread throughout the world. # The Garden of Eden must be found - It was the common belief in the Middle Ages that the biblical Garden of Eden must have been on the top of a crag or mountaintop so that it would not have been affected by the first destruction of the world by flood. Upon arriving in Venezuela in 1498, Columbus may have thought that the verdant crags of Venezuela bore the garden of the Old Testament of the Bible. # A Last Crusade must take back the Holy Land from the Muslims, and that when Christ comes, he will come back in the place he lived and died: Jerusalem. # A Last World Emperor must be chosen - Columbus had chosen, at least in his mind, that the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, would fulfill this position due to the vast imperial power and religious conviction the Spanish monarchs claimed. A last world emperor would be necessary to lead the aforementioned crusade against the Muslims and to greet Christ at Jerusalem once the previous steps had been completed. Such notions were not new to the period in which Columbus lived. Medieval monastic writers, such as Joachim of Fiore, had made similar claims, which strongly influenced Columbus' apocalyptic writings and beliefs. The manuscript was written by Columbus following his third voyage to the New World. The original manuscript is mostly in Spanish with some Latin. The manuscript was translated into English with commentary by Delno C. West and August Kling and published by the University of Florida Press, Gainesville, in 1991.The Libro de la profecias of Christopher Columbus, Translation and commentary by Delno C.

He appeared in 404 games in Major League Baseball (MLB) over six seasons (1958‚Äì1963) for the Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Athletics, and Cleveland Indians. During the 1959 World Series, Essegian, then with the Dodgers, set a Series record with two pinch-hit home runs against the Chicago White Sox. The mark would be matched by Bernie Carbo of the Boston Red Sox, who a hit pair of pinch-hit homers against the Cincinnati Reds in the 1975 Series.Baseball Digest ‚Äì World Series record book: high marks for a single series Essegian also played one season (1964) in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Kintetsu Buffaloes. Listed as tall and , he threw and batted right-handed. Stanford baseball and football star Essegian was born in Boston but grew up from the age of five in Los Angeles. He graduated from Fairfax High School and matriculated at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, where he played varsity baseball and football. A linebacker, he played in the Rose Bowl after Stanford's 1951 football season and is the second player (after Jackie Jensen) to have appeared in both the World Series and the Rose Bowl.The Baseball Page MLB career After spending five full years in minor league baseball, Essegian entered the majors in with the Phillies, getting into 39 games (and bashing five home runs). Then, in , he played for two Triple-A clubs and two MLB teams, and set his World Series mark. He began the year with the Cardinals, playing in 17 games but batting only .179; he was sent down to Rochester, then traded to the Dodgers on June 15. His hometown team optioned Essegian to Triple-A Spokane for six weeks before recalling him in early August. Essegian responded by batting .304 for the Dodgers in 24 games and helped them win the National League (NL) pennant. Then, during the 1959 World Series, he clubbed his two pinch hit homers; the first, hit in the seventh inning of Game 2 off Bob Shaw, enabled the Dodgers to tie the game 2‚Äì2Retrosheet box score: October 2, 1959 and turn the tide of the World Series. After losing Game 1 to the White Sox 11‚Äì0, with Essegian's game-tying blast (then Charlie Neal's two-run shot two batters later), Los Angeles went on to win Game 2, 4‚Äì3, and then capture the world championship in six games. Essegian continued his nomadic career soon after the 1959 Fall Classic, however. After batting only .215 in 52 games for the 1960 Dodgers, he was dealt to the American League (AL), where he had a one-game trial with the Orioles (), two stints (1961; ) with the Athletics, and his most prolonged tenure, 166 games, as a member of the Indians (1961‚Äì). His most productive season came in 1962, when he posted career bests in batting (.274), runs (59), hits (92), doubles (12), home runs (21), runs batted in (RBI) (50), and games played (106). In his six-season career, Essegian was a .255 hitter (260-for-1,018) with 45 doubles, four triples, 47 home runs, and 150 RBI in 404 games. Defensively, he recorded a .981 fielding percentage as an outfielder. Japan and minor leagues Following his big league career, Essegian played the season in NPB, for the Kintetsu Buffaloes of the Pacific League. He also played in seven seasons in Minor League Baseball (MiLB) seasons between 1953 and 1959, registering a .311 average, with 97 homers, in 717 games.Japan Baseball Daily Life after baseball After Essegian‚Äôs baseball career ended, he earned a law degree and became an attorney in Southern California, retiring in 1987.Wancho, Joseph, Chuck Essegian.

In pre-Islamic Arabia, the decision of \\"postponement\\" had been administered by the Banu Kinanah, by a man known as the al-Qalammas (pl. qalƒÅmisa). Different interpretations of its meaning have been proposed.  As postponement not related to a calendar fixed to seasons  Some scholars maintain that the pre-Islamic calendar used in Central Arabia was a purely lunar calendar similar to the modern Islamic calendar.Mahmud Effendi (1858), as discussed in Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars (London: 1901), pp. 460‚Äì470.F.C. De Blois, \\"TA æRƒ™KH\\": I.1.iv. \\"Pre-Islamic and agricultural calendars of the Arabian peninsula\\", The Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd edition, X:260.A. Moberg, \\"NASI'\\", The Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd, VII:977. According to this view, nasƒ´ æ is related to the pagan practices of the Meccan Arabs, where they would alter the distribution of the forbidden months within a given year without implying a calendar manipulation. This interpretation is supported by Arab historians and lexicographers, like Ibn Hisham, Ibn Manzur, and the corpus of tafsir. Thus the Encyclopaedia of Islam concludes, \\"The Arabic system of [Nasƒ´ æ] can only have been intended to move the Hajj and the fairs associated with it in the vicinity of Mecca to a suitable season of the year. It was not intended to establish a fixed calendar to be generally observed.\\"The Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd edition, Index, p. 441 This interpretation is also corroborated by an early Sabaean language inscription, where a religious ritual was \\"postponed\\" (ns' æw) due to war. According to the context of this inscription, the verb ns' æ has nothing to do with intercalation, but only with moving religious events within the calendar itself. The similarity between the religious concept of this ancient inscription and the Qur'an suggests that non-calendaring postponement is also the Qur'anic meaning of Nasƒ´ æ.  As lunisolar intercalation  Others concur that the pre-Islamic calendar was originally a lunar calendar, but suggest that about 200 years before the Hijra it was transformed into a lunisolar calendar containing an intercalary month added from time to time to keep the pilgrimage within the season of the year when merchandise was most abundant. This interpretation was first proposed by the medieval Muslim astrologer and astronomer Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi,Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi (787‚Äì886), Kitab al-Uluf, Journal Asiatique, series 5, xi (1858) 168+. and later by al-Biruni,al-Biruni, \\"Intercalation of the Ancient Arabs\\", The Chronology of Ancient Nations, tr. C. Edward Sachau, (London: William H. Allen, 1000/1879) 13‚Äì14, 73‚Äì74. al-Mas'udi, and some Western scholars.A. Moberg, \\"NASI'\\", E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam This view was also held by the Quran scholar and translator Abdullah Yusuf Ali.Appendix 6 in The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary (Lahore, 1934) pp. 1207-1208 in the 1985 King Fahd reprint. This interpretation considers Nasƒ´ æ to be a synonym to the Arabic word for \\"intercalation\\" (kabƒ´sa). It also suggests that every second or third year the beginning of the year was postponed by one month. The intercalation doubled the month of the pilgrimage, that is, the month of the pilgrimage and the following month were given the same name, postponing the names and the sanctity of all subsequent months in the year by one. The first intercalation doubled the first month Muharram, then three years later the second month Safar was doubled, continuing until the intercalation had passed through all twelve months of the year and returned to Muharram, when it was repeated. The Arabs, according to one explanation mentioned by Abu Ma'shar, learned of this type of intercalation from the Jews.Moberg, p. 977. Prohibition under Islam In the tenth year of the Hijra, according to sura 9:36‚Äì37, a prohibition of Nasƒ´ æ was enacted: The prohibition of Nasƒ´ æ would presumably have been announced when the intercalated month had returned to its position just before the month of Nasƒ´ æ began. If Nasƒ´ æ meant intercalation, then the number and the position of the intercalary months between 1 AH and 10 AH are uncertain; Western calendar dates commonly cited for key events in early Islam such as the Hijra, the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Trench, should be viewed with caution as they might be in error by one, two or even three lunar months. This prohibition was mentioned by Muhammad during the Farewell Sermon which was delivered on 9 Dhu al-Hijjah 10 AH (Julian date Friday March 6, 632) on Mount Arafat during the Farewell Pilgrimage to Mecca. The three successive forbidden months mentioned by Muhammad (months in which battles are forbidden) are Dhu al-Qi'dah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram, months 11, 12, and 1. The single forbidden month is Rajab, month 7. These months were considered forbidden both within the new Islamic calendar and within the old pagan Meccan calendar.

He probably lived towards the end of the thirteenth century, as one of his works is dedicated to his tutor, Joseph Racendytes, who lived in the reign of Andronikos II Palaiologos (1282‚Äì1328). One of his school-fellows is supposed to have been Apocauchus, whom he describes (though without naming him) as going upon an embassy to the north.De Math. Med. Prnef. in i. ii. pp. 139, 169 Actuarius wrote several books on medicinal subjects, particularly, an extensive treatise about the urines and uroscopy. Around 1299, he considered moving to Thessaloniki, but decided to stay in Constantinople; later, he was appointed chief physician to the Emperor. Some of Actuarius' works were translated into Latin, and published in the 16th century. Works *' (Lat. De Actionibus et Affectibus Spiritus Animalis, ejusque Nutritione). This is a psychological and physiological work in two books, in which all his reasoning seems to be founded upon the principles laid down by Aristotle, Galen, and others, with relation to the same subject. The style of this tract is by no means impure, and has a great mixture of the old Attic in it, which is very rarely to be met with in the later Greek writers. A tolerably full abstract of it is given by Barchusen.Barchusen, Hist. Medic. Dial. 14. p. 338, &c.; It was first published in a Latin translation by Giulio Alessandrini in 1547. The first edition of the original was published in 1557, edited, without notes or preface, by Jac. Goupyl. A second Greek edition appeared in 1774, under the care of J. F. Fischer. Ideler has also inserted it in the first volume of his Physici et Medici Graeci Minores (1841); and the first part of J. S. Bernardi Reliquiae Medico-Criticae (1795) contains some Greek Scholia on the work. *' (Lat. De Methodo Medendi). Six books which have hitherto appeared complete only in a Latin translation, though Dietz had, before his death, collected materials for a Greek edition of this and his other works.See his preface to Galen De Dissect. Musc. In these books, says Friend, though he chiefly follows Galen, and very often A√´tius Amidenus and Paulus Aegineta without naming them, yet he makes use of whatever he finds to his purpose both in the old and modern writers, Greeks as well \\"barbarians\\"; and indeed we find in him several things that are not to be met with elsewhere. The work was written extempore, and designed for the use of Apocauchus during his embassy to the north.Praef. i. p. 139 A Latin translation of this work by Corn. H. Mathisius, was first published in 1554. The first four books appear sometimes to have been considered to form a complete work, of which the first and second have been inserted by Ideler in the second volume of his Physici et Medici Graeci Minores (1542), under the title ' (Lat. De Morborum Dignotione), and from which the Greek extracts in H. Stephens's Dictionarium Medicum (1564) are probably taken. The fifth and sixth books have also been taken for a separate work, and were published by themselves in a Latin translation by Ioannes Ruellius (1539), with the title De Medicamentorum Compositione. An extract from this work is inserted in Jean Fernel's collection of writers De Febribus (1576). *' (Lat. De Urinis). A treatise on urine in seven books. Actuarius treated of this subject fully and distinctly, and, though he goes upon the plan which Theophilus Protospatharius had marked out, yet he has added a great deal of original matter. It is the most complete and systematic work on the subject that remains from antiquity, so much so that, till the chemical improvements of the 19th century, he had left hardly anything new to be said by the moderns, many of whom transcribed it almost word for word. This work was first published in a Latin translation by Ambrose Leo (1519), and has been reprinted numerous times; the Greek original was published for the first time in the second volume of Ideler's work quoted above. Two Latin editions of his collected works are said by Choulant to have been published in the same year,Choulant, Handbuch der B√ºcherkunde f√ºr die Aeltere Medicin, Leipzig, 1841 1556, one at Paris, and the other at Lyons.

Her good standing with the public helped to strengthen the reputations of actresses in general, who were often looked down upon as morally lax.Fiona Ritchie, Women and Shakespeare in the Eighteenth Century (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014), p. 43 ff. On 15 April 1740 she appeared as Mrs Riot, the Fine Lady in David Garrick's first successful play Lethe; or Aesop in the Shades. Her role at Drury Lane was recorded in a painting and a memorial porcelain figure. She chose this satirical this role for her benefit. Clive rose to become one of the highest paid actresses of her time and may have even earned more than many male performers, who were traditionally paid more their female counterparts.Felicity Nussbaum, Rival Queens: Actresses, Performance, and the Eighteenth-Century British Theater (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), p. 51. Her career on stage spanned over forty years, and according to K. A. Crouch, \\"[h]er pay places her among the very best actresses of her generation.\\" Crouch, K. A. \\"Clive , Catherine (1711‚Äì1785).\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, ed. H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison. Oxford: OUP, 2006. Kitty Clive became a household name along with other theatre greats of the time such as Lavinia Fenton and Susannah Cibber, and brought her earning power and fame to play as an open supporter of actors' rights. In particular, she published a pamphlet in 1744, The Case of Mrs. Clive, in which she publicly shamed the managers Christopher Rich and Charles Fleetwood for conspiring to pay actors less than their due. She also challenged the public's habit of associating actors with beggars and prostitutes.Felicity Nussbaum, Rival Queens: Actresses, Performance, and the Eighteenth-Century British Theater (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), pp. 163 ff. Clive tried her hand at writing farces, with some success. She wrote several satirical sketches with feminist undertones including The Rehearsal, or Boys in Petticoats (1750); Every Woman in her Humour (1760); and Sketches of a Fine Lady‚Äôs Return from a Rout (1763). In these pieces she used humour to criticize the challenges that female performers and playwrights faced. Memorials In 1761 Kitty Clive lived in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. She retired in 1769 to a villa in Twickenham, which had been a gift from her friend Horace Walpole. She died there in 1785 and was buried at St Mary's, Twickenham, where there is a memorial to her in the north-east corner of the church,Lynn F. Pearson, Discovering Famous Graves (2008, ), p. 82. inscribed with a poem that praises her generosity. A pair of Bow figures of Clive and Henry Woodward as \\"the Fine Lady\\" and \\"the Fine Gentleman\\" in David Garrick's mythological burlesque Lethe, 1750‚Äì1752, may be \\"the earliest full-length portrait figures in English porcelain\\".J.

In over ten years, the band has experienced a number of line-up changes and self-released albums. Musical style Their dance-oriented sound characteristically blends 1977 punk stylings, with influences from psychedelic rock from around the world (like Turkey and Iran), Punjabi folk music, surf rock, reggae, disco, and dub. Their songs are often self-referential and situational, often challenging listeners to re-evaluate their assumptions of what it means to be American, or Muslim, or punk.  History  In 2005, with the release of just two songs on the internet website MySpace, The Kominas found themselves subjects of national news pieces and film and radio documentaries. Initially self-labeled as Bollywood Punk, the band adopted the label \\"Taqwacore\\", in reference to a book called The Taqwacores by American novelist Michael Muhammad Knight, which imagines what a would-be American Muslim Punk scene would look like. This connection quickly fascinated American and International Media, which led to much being written about this unique example of life-imitating-art, and many international tours with the author. Many fans of this phenomenon felt that this was a necessary complicating counter-narrative to a simplistic and largely Islamophobic post-9/11 American media landscape. They came to renown in South Asia from songs they released in Punjabi, Urdu, and Hindi. Their filmed BBC session where the band covered Bollywood classic \\"Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai\\" especially got the band much positive attention from the Southern Asian and Punjabi peoples, both native and abroad. One of their biggest hits is the song \\"Tunnnnnn\\", which is a re-interpretation of a classic reggae song; Willie Williams' \\"Armagideon Time\\". The lyrics of \\"Tunnnnnn\\" are a mashup of English, Urdu, and Punjabi. Its lyrics proclaim (in Urdu): \\"We will only drink what they drink in Iraq! We will only drink what they drink in Karbala!\\", touching upon the subject of the horrific reality of warfare and the bombs which were dropped on those places. \\"Tunnnnnn\\" was an instant hit with both Kominas fans and newcomers alike. With the self-titled release \\"Kominas\\" in 2012, the band has adopted the more Americana rock elements grunge and garage rock in their style and moved away from writing about Muslim-centric issues. From 2009‚Äì2012 the band toured extensively around America, Canada, and Europe. However, since 2012, the band's output has only been mostly daily missives on their Facebook page, which is more often than not, a commentary on the daily politics of race and religion. Though their commentary has remained political, many fans feel their music has grown less ethnocentric or religious-minded and has taken become more absurdist and nihilistic. Political activism The Kominas use a variety of ways to identify themselves to their Pakistani heritage. For example, they use the word ‚Äúbrown‚Äù on Twitter to evoke their racial meanings. The word is used as an identifier of the people of South Asian and Pakistani origins. It connects them to their heritage and to other similar brands and people. The Taqwacore label was another way the Kominas identified themselves. While Taqwacore consists mainly of Islamic punk rockers, bands like The Kominas don‚Äôt like how the religious aspect of the label is what people focus on. The band is just as much about the politics of what Taqwacore is. It is about promoting their heritage in a new and different way: through punk rock and through social media. The Kominas and the label Taqwacore brings together people despite the distance that may or may not be between them. They are united through their identity of being ‚Äúbrown,‚Äù their love of punk rock, and/or their religious affiliations. The Kominas‚Äô songs and lyrics have a political aspect. They are meant to cause a change in a predominantly white culture. They wish to create safe spaces for people of color listening to their music.

After being involved in undercover operations in Vichy- held Madagascar ahead of the allied landings there in May 1942, Antelme joined the SOE F (France) section in England. He undertook two missions in occupied France. On this third mission, on the night of 28/29 February 1944, he , along with SOE operatives Lionel Lee and Madaleine Dermement, parachuted to a reception committee compromised by the Gestapo, and were captured.Foot, M.R.D, SOE: The Special Operations Executive 1940-46 pp 193,194Marks,Leo pp 511,512 In accordance with Adolph Hitler's \\"Nacht und Nebel\\" directive regarding irregular combatants, he and 18 other captured SOE officers were executed at the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in Lower Silesia in July or August 1944. Early life France Antelme was born on 12 March 1900 in Curepipe, Mauritius, to an influential family of planters and politicians. After attending the Royal College Curepipe, he embarked on a career as broker and trader, travelling extensively between Mauritius, R√©union, Madagascar and South Africa. In 1932, he settled in Durban, Union of South Africa, as Madagascar's trade representative in South Africa. The following year he married Doris O'Toole. He was survived by his sons, Michel and Gaston.Antelme family Todd mission Antelme was recruited by the SOE in November 1941 in Durban, South Africa where he was serving with the South African artillery. He formed part of the Todd mission, led by Lt. Col. J.E.S. Todd, whose task it was to gather intelligence on Madagascar and to try to win political leaders to the allied cause ahead of Operation Ironclad, the British landing at Diego Suarez, on 5 May 1942. He was landed by boat near Majunga (Mahajanga), Madagascar on 8 February 1942, and brought back political and military intelligence from the island, where he had many contacts. After serving at the Todd mission's operational headquarters in Dar es Salaam, Antelme was sent to England where he joined the SOE F section on 1 July 1942. He underwent training at Beaulieu and at Arisaig, Scotland.Service Record:Major Joseph Antoine France Antelme, no.239255 Missions to France On his first mission to France, from November 1942 to March 1943, Antelme organized the BRICKLAYER Foot,M.R.D SOE in France pp 231circuit and established contacts with political circles and leading French civil servants with a view to supplying the allied expeditionary forces with food and currency. He was back in France in May that year, carrying messages from Winston Churchill to former French prime ministers √âdouard Herriot and Paul Reynaud, inviting them to come to England.Marks,Leo pp 510-512 The mission started well with the demolition of the locomotive turntables at Le Mans. But when his fellow SOE officer and associate, Francis Suttill, was arrested on 23 June and his PROSPER circuit destroyed, Antelme was on the run. He managed to evade the Gestapo for a month, being extracted from France by a Lysander aircraft on 20 July. He had failed to meet Herriot and Reynaud, but he learned that they were willing, though unable, to act. They were too well guarded for their extraction to be feasible. He nevertheless took back with him a valuable recruit ‚Äî the well connected international lawyer, Ma√Ætre W. J. Savy. Savy later returned to France and organized the WIZARD network that provided the intelligence leading to the destruction by the Allies of 2,000 V1 rockets.Foot,M.R.D SOE in France pp 325 While Antelme was in France, Noor Inayat Khan landed on 17 June 1943 as wireless operator to the PHONO circuit that he had set up. Antelme put Henri Garry in charge as sub-organiser for Francis Suttill's PROSPER circuit. Shortly after she arrived, PROSPER was betrayed and the Germans seized Suttill and his friends. Inayat Khan evaded capture, sending more than 20 messages on the run until she was betrayed by Garry's sister, Ren√©e, four months later and arrested in her apartment. Garry was captured by the Gestapo shortly afterwards.Overton Fuller, Dericourt: The Chequered Spy, pp5-6 Betrayal, capture and death The seizure of Inayat Khan's wireless set and code-books enabled the Germans to play back false messages to London. Despite the growing certainty that the PHONO circuit was in German hands, Major Antelme volunteered to be dropped to a PHONO reception committee. He, his radio- operator, Captain Lionel Lee, and courier Madeleine Damerment ‚Äî three of the SOE's best agents ‚Äî took off from RAF Tempsford airfield in Bedfordshire late on 28 February 1944. Early the following morning, they parachuted into a field near the village of Saintville, some 50 km east of Chartres. The Gestapo was waiting for them. Reportedly in a towering rage, Antelme was taken to Gestapo headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris and reportedly would not talk even under torture.Foot,M.R.D. SOE in France pp 302 Antelme was one of 18 SOE agents who were parachuted directly into enemy hands. Eleven of them, including Antelme, were dropped in February and March 1944 ‚Äî despite strong evidence that the Germans had gained control of the SOE circuits with whom the drops were arranged. Three weeks earlier another SOE team, consisting of Capt. J.P.H. Ledoux, Capt. F.A. Deniset, Lt. R.E.J. Alexandre, a Canadian arms instructor for Garry's circuit, and the Canadian radio operator, Lt. R. B. Byerly, had also been dropped to a German controlled PHONO reception. Shortly afterwards transmissions were received from Bylery's set, but they failed to contain the special messages that confirmed their authenticity. The men of both teams died at the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in what is today the town of Rogo≈∫nica in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Poland. Madeleine Damerment was shot at the Dachau concentration camp on 13 September 1944 with fellow SOE agents Noor Inayat Khan, Yolande Beekman and Eliane Plewman. Memorials and decorations France Antelme is commemorated on the roll of honour of the Valen√ßay SOE Memorial in France, on the Brookwood Memorial in Surrey, England, on the Cenotaph in Durban, South Africa and on a memorial at the Gross-Rosen concentration camp to the SOE officers who died there.

The LM is based on the McLaren F1 GTR and built on the standard F1 chassis, with modifications necessary for it to be a road legal car‚Äîbut without the engine intake restrictions that racing regulations impose on the GTR racing car.  Background  In late 1995, McLaren built five F1 LMs (LM for Le Mans) in honour of the five McLaren F1 GTR's that finished the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans and took the overall win. McLaren designed the standard F1 as an ultimate road car, in the sense that it strives to be comfortable and usable in everyday conditions despite being a potent sports car. However, the LM edition is a lower and stiffer, track-oriented vehicle, with a stripped down, bare interior, and solid aluminium bushings in place of the rubber bushings in the suspension system and without the Ground Plane Shear Centre system on the standard F1. McLaren F1 XP1 LM Prototype Of the production run of six, five F1 LMs were sold and the sixth, the Papaya orange prototype F1 LM, XP1 LM, was retained by McLaren and used as the platform for the continued development of the F1 chassis. This car was promised by McLaren CEO Ron Dennis to Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton if he won two Formula One World Championship titles. However, Lewis Hamilton left McLaren with his single World Championship title to drive for the rival Mercedes Formula One team in 2013 and the car still remains in possession of McLaren. The F1 LMs can be identified by their Papaya orange paint. The F1 LM's were painted in this colour in memory and tribute to Bruce McLaren, whose race colour was Papaya orange. It has been discovered however, that contrary to the official word from McLaren at the time, only four (including the prototype) of the LMs were originally painted 'Papaya' orange, with two of the three delivered to The Sultan of Brunei being painted black with graphics.  Specifications and modifications   Weight  The weight was reduced by approximately over that of original, through the removal of various pieces of trim and use of optional equipment, i.a. no interior noise suppression, no audio system, a stripped down base interior, no fan assisted ground effect and no dynamic rear wing‚Äîgiving the McLaren F1 LM a total mass of .  Engine  The F1 LM also used the same engine as the 1995 F1 GTR without the race-mandated restrictors. The engine has a compression ratio of 11.0:1 and produces at 7,800 rpm. It has a peak torque of at 4,500 rpm; the redline is at 8,500 rpm. The total weight and horsepower of the car gives it a weight to power ratio of 3.4 lb/hp.  Aerodynamics  The aerodynamics of the LM is directly derived from the GTR race car. The bodywork of the vehicle has the addition of a larger cooling duct at the nose of the machine and cooling ducts on either side of the car for the brakes where the storage lockers are seen on the standard F1. In the place of the small dynamic rear wing seen on the regular F1 there is a considerably larger, manually adjustable CFRP rear wing mounted on the back of the vehicle, it has a CFRP splitter at the front, side skirts and extensions for the wheel arches to increase downforce and thus give the car more grip. The car also features the diffuser from the GTR race car.  Tyres  The McLaren F1 LM uses Michelin SX-MXX3 tyres and features specially-designed 18-inch (457 mm) magnesium alloy wheels. The tyres at the front are 275/35 ZR 18, while at the rear 345/35 ZR 18. The front wheels are 10.85 x 18 inches and at the rear 13.00 x 18 inches.  Brakes  The carbon ceramic brakes on the GTR are not present on the LM, the front and rear callipers on the brakes are four-piston monobloc light alloy callipers, ventilated using the cooling system from a 1995 F1 GTR.  Gearbox, clutch and miscellaneous  The LM has an upgraded gearbox with gun drilled driveshaft derived from the F1 GTR, tripod CV joint and straight cut gears, although the gear ratios are identical to the standard F1, i.e. 3.23:1, 2.19:1, 1.71:1, 1.39:1, 1.16:1, 0.93:1, with a final drive of 2.37:1. The LM does not benefit from the magnesium gearbox casing of the 1996 F1 GTR. The clutch of the LM is a hydraulic remote actuation triple plate carbon/carbon clutch, the clutch is 200 mm (7.87 in) in diameter. The F1 LM has a fuel tank capacity of .  Performance  The F1 LM is considered the quickest incarnation of the McLaren F1 road cars through the gears and in overall track performance. It has a tested 0- time of 3.9 seconds due to wheelspin at the start, 0- in 6.7 seconds and was once the holder of many world records, including the 0-100-0 mph record it completed in 11.5 seconds (over a distance of ) when driven by Andy Wallace at the disused airbase RAF Alconbury in Cambridgeshire.  Acceleration  * 0‚Äì: 3.9 seconds * 0‚Äì: 6.7 seconds  Top speed  * , which is less than the standard version due to added aerodynamic drag.

Prelude  The initial contact with the USSR came with Presidential Envoy and Director of the Lend-Lease programme Harry Hopkins with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in Moscow. On 30 July 1941 Hopkins briefed journalists at Spaso House, the US Embassy residence. At 20.00, he was described as looking 'pale and tired' and speaking 'faintly, his voice dwindling away at times to and inaudible mumble'. Hopkins confirmed he had spoken with Stalin and had informed the Soviet leader of President Roosevelt's admiration for the Russian resistance to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Hopkins added that he had told Stalin of the United States' resolve to support the USSR with supplies. Stalin thanked Hopkins and told him the confidence in his country would not be misplaced. The pair met again at 18.00 the following day at the Kremlin. Hopkins once more returned to Spaso House and brief the press. He described how pleasantries were done away with and they got down to specifics. Hopkins added - Hopkins concluded his business and flew back to London on Friday 1 August. The Moscow conference was proposed following the meeting between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt at Placentia Bay. A joint message was sent to from Churchill and Roosevelt to Joseph Stalin with the proposal. It was delivered to Stalin on August 15 at 18.00 by US Ambassador Laurence Steinhardt and British Ambassador Sir Stafford Cripps. They handed over identical copies signed by Roosevelt and Churchill. Stalin immediately dictated a reply for presentation to the ambassadors giving his agreement to the proposal. An announcement on Radio Moscow said -  The Conference  The delegates flew into Moscow on 28 September. They were greeted by Vice-Commissar Andrei Vyshinsky and the staffs of the British and US embassies. W. Averell Harriman representing the United States of America and Lord Beaverbrook representing the United Kingdom met with Vyacheslav Molotov (Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs) presiding. Their respective ambassadors took the delegates to meet Stalin on the same evening. Molotov was also present along with Maxim Litvinov who was attending as a delegate acted as translator. The conference opened on 29 September at the residence of the Foreign Commissariat, the Spiridonovka Palace. Following a closed session an official communique was released, prepared by Quentin Reynolds (of Collier's magazine) and Vernon Bartlett MP (News Chronicle and BBC). This main session lasted for 30 minutes but delegations appointed members for the committees who went into immediate session. They were instructed to have reports on the Soviet requirements ready by the morning of 3 October. The conference reconvened on 1 October, two days ahead of schedule, for the second and final meeting of the main delegations. The agreement signed, known as the First Protocol, was signed on 1 October 1941. The agreement was set to run until June 1942. It promised the Soviet Union 400 aircraft, 500 tanks and 10,000 trucks a month in addition to other supplies. A joint statement was issued by Lord Beaverbrook and Avril Harriman, separate from the conference communique. The closing paragraph stated - The delegates departed by Douglas passenger planes on 3 October where they boarded HMS Harrier in the White Sea. The Halcyon-class minesweeper took them to meet the County-class heavy cruiser HMS London to transfer the party at sea. A gangplank was passed between the two ships and American Admiral William Standley crossed first. Lord Beaverbrook crossed with a rope around his waist in case he fell. The ships separated and HMS London called via loudspeaker \\"Well done, Harrier, Well done\\". In a speech of 6 November 1941 to mark the 24th anniversary of the October Revolution Joseph Stalin stated -  Churchill's Caviar  Aside from the main events of the conference there was an incident regarding the purchase of caviar for Prime Minister Churchill. Philip Jordan, reporting for the News Chronicle from the news conference. However, his despatches were also carried by The Times and Lord Beaverbrook's own Daily Express. Jordan learned from an undisclosed source that Lord Beaverbrook had sent an employee to buy ¬£25GBP (approximately $100USD) for the Prime Minister. Churchill read the report and telegraphed Lord Beaverbrook, who in turn asked Jordan about the matter. Jordan refused to name his source and Beaverbrook accused younger officials from the British Embassy of leaking information. Ultimately, while it turned out to be true that Churchill had ordered the caviar the amount was exaggerated. However, it was feared that it would reflect badly that such a large quantity of caviar was purchased at a time of rationing.

The village lies close to the Bug River. It has 350 inhabitants. It is known as the site during World War II of one of the German Nazi extermination camps, named after the village. An estimated 850,000 people were murdered here during the Holocaust in Poland, from the summer of 1942 to October 1943. In addition, the Treblinka I Arbeitslager, a forced labor camp, had operated about six miles away, from June 1941 to 23 July 1944. During this period, more than 10,000 prisoners are estimated to have died from executions, malnutrition, disease and mistreatment. World War II history Treblinka was the location of Treblinka extermination camp, where an estimated 850,000 people were systematically murdered during the Holocaust in Poland.Clancy Young, Treblinka. Holocaust Research Project. About 800,000 of them were Polish Jews. The first deportations took place in the course of the Grossaktion Warsaw with about 254,000 Warsaw Ghetto inmates brought in to their deaths in Holocaust trains in the summer of 1942. At the layover yard of Treblinka railway station, the wagons waiting for \\"processing\\" were witnessed by Franciszek ZƒÖbecki. During the early period of the camp's operation, when thousands of dead bodies of victims were left unburied, the putrid odor of decaying human remains could be smelled for approximately in every direction. It was evident that mass extermination was taking place at the camp, which caused panic among the villagers. The onset of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising inspired renewed hopes for an escape among the Treblinka Sonderkommandos. On 19 April 1943 one of the last Jewish transports of 7,000 victims, along with the Warsaw insurgents, were brought in for gassing. Soon after the first prisoner uprising at a death camp against the SS erupted on 2 August 1943, under the leadership of former Polish Army officer Dr. Berek Lajcher.Kop√≥wka & Rytel-Andrianik 2011, chpt. Treblinka II. Some of these prisoners were aided in escaping across the Bug River by the Polish resistance, but few survived. Ma≈Çkinia The first commandant of the camp, from until 31 August 1942, was Irmfried Eberl, relieved of his duties for not being efficient and secretive enough about the camp's murder operation. He was succeeded by Franz Stangl (previously the commandant of Sobibor extermination camp) as the second commandant of Treblinka II Vernichtungslager from 1 September 1942 until the 1943 Jewish uprising.BBC History of World War II. Auschwitz; Inside the Nazi State. Part 3: Factories of Death. The Nazi hierarchy took measures to modify the killing process under Stangl, who built more efficient gas chambers and massive cremation pyres for the incineration of corpses. When the Treblinka death camp ended operations in October 1943, the Nazis attempted (in vain) to remove all evidence of its existence and the mass murder carried out there. Relatively little physical evidence remains. It can be examined at the Treblinka museum, which is led by Edward Kop√≥wka. The number of visitors there has been steadily growing. An earlier forced labor camp known as Treblinka I Arbeitslager, equipped with heavy machinery, was located from Treblinka. Between June 1941 and 23 July 1944, more than half of its 20,000 inmates mining gravel for the German military road construction, died from summary executions, hunger, disease, and mistreatment under commander Theodor van Eupen. Treblinka extermination camp museum Memorial at Treblinka II, with 17,000 quarry stones symbolising gravestones. The construction of a stone monument with abstract reliefs and Jewish symbols was inaugurated on 21 April 1958 based on a design by sculptor Franciszek Dusze≈Ñko. He expressed the European trend toward stylized and avant-garde forms. The monument was unveiled by Zenon Kliszko, the Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland on 10 May 1964; attendees included survivors of the Treblinka uprising from Israel, France, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. The official ceremony was attended by 30,000 people, when Treblinka was declared a national monument of martyrology. The camp custodian's house (built nearby in 1960) was adapted as an exhibition space following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989. Since the late 20th century, the number of visitors coming to Treblinka from abroad has steadily increased. An exhibition centre at the former camp opened in 2006. It was later expanded and made into a branch of the Siedlce Regional Museum, under Dr Edward Kop√≥wka.

The station is operated by Chiltern Railways, on the Chiltern Main Line, and has four platforms in use. History A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Banbury. Banbury Bridge Street station opened on 2 September 1850, some four months after the Buckinghamshire Railway (L&NWR;) opened its terminus. When meadows and the recently disused racecourse at Grimsbury were sold to the Great Western Railway (GWR) in about 1850, the owner also sold the other part of his land, north of the Middleton road to the Banbury Freehold Land Society, which was financially backed by Cobb's Bank, on which to build middle-class houses, but development was slow at the time and some plots were never built upon. The station was going to be part of the GWR's Oxford and Rugby Railway, before the problems with changing gauges at prevented it. The single track extension from Oxford to Banbury did open, and at first Banbury was just a single platform through station (works were continuing to Birmingham) however the popularity of the line meant that the route was soon double tracked barely two years later, and the station was given an extra platform in an up and down configuration. By 1882, an extra Up Goods Line had been laid on the East side of the Station [outside the Train Shed]; together with a Transfer Line to the LNWR Route. In 1903, Banbury had south and north bays \\"cut\\" into the Up Platform; along with an extra bay on the downside at the North end. There was a Down Goods Loop north of the Station; all this to cope with traffic from the Great Central Main Line, which joined at Banbury North Junction in 1900. The inclusion of terminating bays and goods loops reflected Banbury's increasing strategic position in the National network. In 1904 the refreshment rooms were rebuilt to the designs of Percy Emerson Culverhouse. The Station was rebuilt into its present form in 1958. Banbury was once a junction for the line to , however that closed in the 1960s. There was also another station nearby at . Banbury Bridge Street station occupied one of the most strategic and important locations in the entire rail network in Britain. For example, the Aberdeen to Penzance Express used the branch of the GCR through Banbury as part of its journey and the \\"Ports to Ports Express\\" between the North-East (Newcastle, etc.) and South Wales (Cardiff, ) used the Great Central Railway branch line and the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway, and passed through Banbury as well as Newcastle ‚Äî , Newcastle ‚Äî Southampton, ‚Äî Sleeper, Bournemouth ‚Äî /, etc. Most Cross Country Services in Britain passed through Banbury, which helped the growth of the town and its cattle market. After nationalisation in 1948, the station was renamed Banbury General to distinguish it from Banbury Merton Street station. Banbury Merton Street was closed in 1966, and the suffix was officially discontinued by 1974, although it remained on tickets until the Edmondson type ticket machines were replaced in the early 1980s. The current railway station is on the site of the Great Western Railway line that opened to Banbury in 1850. The original station's overall roof survived until 1953, five years before a rebuild in 1958. The rebuilding of the station was delayed due to the Second World War, and could have been based on the GWR's new station at Leamington Spa, which was finished just before war commenced. The new station of 1958 was designed by Howard Cavanagh. Passenger traffic at Banbury has grown rapidly: between 2003 and 2010, the number of passengers using the station increased by 85%.Office of the Rail Regulator data: see infobox at head of article. Former services through Banbury * \\"Ports to Ports\\" Middlesbrough/Hull/ ‚Äî Cardiff/Newport/// * Bournemouth ‚Äî Birkenhead * Birkenhead ‚Äî Dover Margate and Brighton via Reading and Redhill. This was operated jointly by the GWR and the SR, southbound once daily by one company and northbound by the other. The station  Layout Map of the platforms at Banbury station. After the rebuilding of the station in 1956‚Äì58 there were six numbered platforms: these were formed into two islands, the western one having two through tracks and a single bay at its northern end, whilst the eastern island had a single through platform, but two bays, one at each end. The two islands were connected to each other, and to the station entrance hall, by a footbridge. At that time, the three through platforms were numbered 1, 3 & 4 from west to east, whilst the three bays were 2, 5 & 6\\\\. All but one have been re-designated since ‚Äî the present-day platform 2 was formerly platform 3, whilst the un-numbered bay at its northern end was originally platform 2; and present-day platforms 3 & 4 were formerly 4 & 6 respectively. Platform 5, at the northern end of the present platform 3, has lost both its track and its number. The present station has four numbered platforms (plus one active bay not numbered), numbered 1 to 4 from west to east, and are grouped as two island platforms. Platform 1 is a through platform used as a bay platform by Great Western Railway's terminating local trains to Oxford and commuter trains beyond to Reading and Paddington, and by Chiltern Railways through and terminating services from the south ‚Äì all terminating trains at this platform travel a short distance up the line before reversing back to the same platform and boarding outbound passengers, unless a train has since occupied the platform, which then means the train reverses to platform 3 to board passengers, It is also used as an emergency through platform if one of the others is out of use for any reason. Platforms 2 and 3 are through platforms: platform 2 is for Chiltern services north to Birmingham Moor Street/ Snow Hill and Kidderminster, CrossCountry services to Birmingham New Street, Manchester, the North East and Scotland; platform 3 is for Chiltern services to London via Bicester and CrossCountry services to Oxford, Reading and the South Coast. There are also two terminal platforms: platform 4 is for terminating Chiltern services to and from London; An unnumbered bay platform (known as Platform 2 Bay) was used by terminating Chiltern services to and from Birmingham and Stratford. It was filled in during August 2016. Freight loops serve as main through lines for non-stopping freight trains. Most passenger services passing Banbury stop at the station, and heritage trains stop here to fill up on water. Many redundant loops and sidings surround the station: most of these were for goods services stopping at Banbury, which have all disappeared. Two goods loops survive to allow the stoppage of goods trains for the uninterrupted passage of passenger trains. The station is being considered for remodelling to improve operational flexibility by Network Rail. Two new lower-quadrant semaphore signals were installed in late 2010 to allow passenger trains in platforms 1 & 2 to depart in the up direction. Their numbers were BS27 and BS33, and were controlled from Banbury South signal box. A 9-day long blockade to re-signal and complete alterations to the track layout at the station layout began on 30 July 2016. Both remaining manual signal boxes were closed with new multiple aspect signalling commissioned and all lines through the station coming under the control of the West Midlands Signalling Centre at Saltley.\\"Railway upgrade in Banbury area means Chiltern line will close for nine days\\" Network Rail press release 19 July 2016; Retrieved 1 August 2016 Services Chiltern Railways provide most trains to Banbury, their Monday - Friday off-peak service consisting of: *3 trains per hour to *2 trains per hour to , of which one continues to It is the northern terminus of Great Western Railway's local services from which operate Mondays to Saturdays only.

His work included studies of the epidemiology of poliomyelitis, influenza, diphtheria, and tuberculosis. In 1906, Frost assisted in the first successful arrest of a yellow fever epidemic in the United States. He also helped field investigations regarding typhoid outbreaks and water pollution by applying his knowledge of microbiology laboratory techniques. Frost's personal life is rarely touched on, but one of the presumed reasons that he focused on tuberculosis was because he was diagnosed with incipient pulmonary tuberculosis when he was in his thirties. He had to spend several months in a sanatorium when diagnosed. He is often considered the father of modern epidemiology. Frost's bibliography consists of 57 scientific publications.

It stated - The ambassador suggested it would be advantageous that Churchill and Soviet leader Stalin should meet. Eden noted in his diary, 'Took the telegram round to Winston...and he jumped at it'. Churchill proposed to Stalin travelling via Cairo to meet him at Astrakhan 'or similar convenient meeting place'. Stalin replied with a formal invitation to meet but stated that Moscow was the only suitable place. This was due to neither himself or his senior staff feeling able to leave the capital during the period of 'intense struggle'. Eden expressed concerns for the health of the Prime Minister. When told by Eden of the Prime Minister's plans Oliver Harvey wrote, 'But what gallantry of the old gentleman, setting off at 65 across Africa in the heat of mid-summer!' Churchill set aside health concerns, feeling it was his duty to make the journey. He, along with Sir Alexander Cadogan of the Foreign Office who was to travel with him, were given tests at Farnborough on 31 July for high altitude flying. They were exposed to the equivalent of flying at 15,000 feet while wearing oxygen masks and passed fit. Churchill and his party departed RAF Lyneham shortly after midnight on 1 August 1942 in a Liberator bomber (number AL504), codenamed Commando and piloted by William J. Vanderkloot. Arriving at Gibraltar at dawn, they spent the day there before travelling on to Cairo. Churchill's wife Clementine who had watched his departure, later wrote to her husband - Churchill arrived in Egypt on 4 August, where he stayed at the British Embassy in Cairo. While in Egypt he took the decision to relieve Claude Auckinleck as Commander-in-Chief. The command split, creating Near East and Middle East commands. Auckinleck was to be replaced by Harold Alexander as C-in-C Near East. Lieutenant-general William Gott was to become Commander of the Eighth Army. However, when he was killed the decision was made to appoint Bernard Montgomery. While in Egypt he inspected troops and positions before departing for Tehran after midnight on 10 August. After meetings in the city, the journey was continued to Moscow on August 12. The party arrived at 17.00 the same day after a 10 and a half hour flight.

(2016/01/15).  12 August 1942  The British delegation led by Churchill and Cardogan was met by Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and Chief of Staff, Marshal Boris Shaposhnikov. Upon arrival Churchill and American representative Averell Harriman inspected an honour guard. Churchill then addressed the assembly saying, State Villa No. 7 was allocated to Churchill while Harriman stayed at the US Embassy. Of the villa, Churchill wrote, 'Everything was prepared with totalitarian lavishness'. He was supplied with an aide-de-camp and 'a number of veteran servants in white jackets and beaming smiles'. Churchill was collected from the villa at 19.00 and taken to the Kremlin and his first meeting with Stalin. The initial meeting was had by only a small party consisting of Churchill, Major Charles Dunlop (Embassy Interpreter), Clark Kerr and Harriman. This was due to the aeroplane carrying the rest of the delegation having to return to Tehran because of a technical fault. Churchill reported back to London that the first two hours 'were bleak and sombre'. Stalin reported grave problems on the Eastern Front and that the Germans were making 'a tremendous effort to get to Baku and Stalingrad'. The conversation moved on to the possibility of a Second Front in 1942, which the Soviets were hoping for. Churchill reported that after an 'exhaustive Anglo- American examination', the western allies did not feel able to launch an attack across the English Channel in September 1942. However, he was able to report that preparations were in hand for a landing by 48 divisions in 1943. Churchill added that even by the time the 1943 operation was ready it was conceivable that the Germans may be able to field a stronger force to oppose them. At this the minutes of the meeting note, 'Stalin's face crumpled into a frown'. After further conversation regarding a Second Front in France, Stalin said that the British 'should not be so afraid of the Germans'. He went on to ask, 'Why were we [the British] so afraid of the Germans?' Churchill offered 1940 and the German failure to land troops as a comparable situation, saying that Hitler 'was afraid of the operation'. Stalin disagreed but consented to allow the respective Generals to go into the details of the operation. Churchill turned to the subject of bombing Germany, stating \\"If need be, as the war went on, we hoped to shatter almost every dwelling in almost every German city\\". This improved Stalin's mood and Churchill to the subject of a Second Front in 1942. He relayed to Stalin that the Western Allies had decided on another operation, as France was not the only area to attack. He had been authorised to share this secret by President Roosevelt with Stalin. At this, the minutes record, 'M. Stalin sat up and grinned'. Churchill then proceeded to outline the details of the Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, Operation Torch. The British were nervous that Stalin and Hitler might make separate peace terms; Stalin insisted that would not happen. Churchill explained how Arctic convoys bringing munitions to Russia had been intercepted by the Germans; There was a delay now so that future convoys would be better protected. He apologetically explained there would be no second front this year‚Äîno British-American invasion of France‚Äîwhich Stalin had been urgently requesting for months. The will was there, said Churchill, but there was not enough American troops, not enough tanks, not enough shipping, not enough air superiority. Instead the British, and soon the Americans, would step up bombing of German cities and railways. Furthermore, there would be Operation Torch in November. It would be a major Anglo-American invasion of North Africa, which would set the stage for an invasion of Italy and perhaps open the Mediterranean for munitions shipments to Russia through the Black Sea. The talks started out on a very sour note but after many hours of informal conversations, the two men understood each other and knew they could cooperate smoothly.John Lukacs, \\"The importance of being Winston.\\" The National Interest 111 (2011): 35-45 online. Once Churchill had completed his explanation of the Operation Torch and the strategy to open up the Mediterranean, Stalin said, \\"May God help this enterprise to succeed\\". The minutes record that at this point Stalin's 'interest was now at a high pitch'. The conversation continued until this first meeting of Stalin, Churchill and Harriman drew to a close at 22.40 after three hours and forty minutes. Churchill later signalled to his deputy in London, Labour leader Clement Attlee -  13 August 1942  Moscow Conference, August 12‚Äì17, 1942. Left to right, foreground: Prime Minister Winston Churchill; Premier Joseph Stalin; and W. Averrell Harriman, representing President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Office of War Information Photograph. (2016/01/15). On the second day Churchill began with a meeting at the Kremlin with Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov. Churchill took Molotov over the various operations in the West. Across the abandoned Operation Sledgehammer and Operation Round-Up to the buildup of American forces in Britain, Operation Bolero. The discussion took in the upcoming Operation Torch and the possibilities for Operation Jupiter, the proposed Anglo-Soviet landing in Norway. Churchill, in a telegraph to London, said 'He [Molotov] listened affably but contributed nothing'. As he was leaving Churchill turned to Molotov and said, \\"Stalin will make a great mistake to treat us roughly when we have come so far\\". To which Molotov replied, \\"Stalin is a very wise man. You may be sure that, however he argues, he understands all. I will tell him what you say\\". The aircraft carrying the remainder of the British delegation arrived at 17.00 and they joined Churchill for his second meeting with Stalin at 23.00. Stalin opened the meeting with an aide-memoire attacking the abandoning of plans for a Second Front in 1942. Churchill listened to the document being translated and stated he would reply in writing but that 'we [Britain and America] have made up our minds upon the course to be pursued and that reproaches were vain'. Stalin attacked the British military effort, \\"You British are afraid of fighting. You should not think the Germans are supermen. You will have to fight sooner or later. You cannot win a war without fighting\\". Harriman passed Churchill a note urging him not to take Stalin's words seriously, as he had behaved in the same way during the Moscow Conference in 1941. Churchill called for Colonel Ian Jacob to enter the room and take down what was being said. Churchill expressed his 'disappointment that Stalin should apparently not believe the sincerity of his statements, and distrust his motives'. Churchill then launched into what Harriman described as 'the most brilliant' of his wartime speeches. Even the translator 'got so enthralled by Winston's speech that he put his pencil down'. So swept up in the moment Churchill didn't leave space for the interpreter to relay the last part and Dunlop was not able to relay them verbatim. Stalin laughed, not having heard much of the speech, and said - Churchill got Dunlop to get the precise wording from Jacob's minutes and relay it to Stalin. Churchill wrote to Attlee of the encounter, 'I repulsed all his contentions squarely but without taunts of any kind. I suppose he is not used to being contradicted repeatedly but he did not become at all angry or even animated. On one occasion I said, \\"I pardon that remark only on account of the bravery of the Russian troops.\\"'  14 August 1942  After having lunch with guests including General Brooke and US Ambassador William H. Standley, Churchill retired for his usual afternoon rest. He returned to the Kremlin at 21.00 for his third meeting with Stalin. They went straight into a dinner of around 100 guests. Shortly after sitting, Molotov made a toast to Churchill's health. Churchill in turn replied with a toast to Stalin and he toasted President Roosevelt's heath, as well as that of Harriman. The toasts continued with Stalin going over to click glasses with those whose health he had toasted. This left the Prime Minister without opportunity for conversation with the Soviet leader. After nearly four hours, Stalin took Churchill into a neighbouring room for coffee and liquors. They were also photographed together and with Harriman. Stalin proposed a film screening but at this Churchill retired to his allocated villa to rest. As he telegraphed to Attlee he, 'was afraid we should be drawn into a lengthy film and was fatigued'. After shaking hands with Stalin, Churchill took his leave. Stalin hurried after his guest and escorted him through the halls of the Kremlin to the front door, where they again shook hands. Ambassador Clark Kerr reported to Eden -  15 August 1942  Churchill called for Colonel Jacob at 09.00 to discuss the stormy encounter of 13 August. He had second thoughts about the meeting, wondering if Stalin, 'had perhaps not meant to be as insulting as he [Churchill] first thought'. Jacob recommended another meeting, one-to-one. However, given the importance of the discussion and that Dunlop had been found wanting, Jacob suggested 'we [the British] should fit him [Churchill] out' with a bilingual member of the British Military Mission. Major Arthur Herbert Birse was recommended to which Churchill agreed. Born in St. Petersburg to British parents in 1891, Birse had native fluency in Russian which came from his schooling in the country. This was contrary to the practice of other British families there who sent their children back to the UK for their education. He joined the British Military Mission in Russia in 1917 as an interpreter. However, following the Bolshevik Revolution he moved to the UK and worked for a bank. This saw him sent to Poland and Italy where he learned those languages too. He returned to the military with the outbreak of war and was sent to Russia following the German invasion. The Prime Minister's car entered the Kremlin just before 19.00 and the pair were escorted to a large conference room to meet Stalin. The four, Churchill, Birse, Stalin and his interpreter Vladimir Pavlov sat at the head of the table. Churchill thanked Stalin \\"for all the courtesy and hospitality\\" before stating - Stalin replied that their \\"personal exchange of views has been of the most importance\\" and that \\"the fact that we have met is of very great value\\". While acknowledging that they have had some disagreement he felt that in meeting \\"the ground has been prepared for future agreement\\". The discussion moved onto the American buildup of troops in the UK, which in August 1942 stood at 85,000, against a target of 1 million. They then moved on to Operation Torch and the benefits to Russia, which Churchill acknowledged would be affected 'indirectly'. Churchill also explained a planned 'reconnaissance in force' which was the approaching Dieppe Raid. This was described as an action to \\"make Germany anxious about a attack from across the Channel\\" with \\"some 8,000 men with 50 tanks\\". Stalin then took Churchill over the situation on the Eastern Front along with plans to defend the Caucasus and block the German drive towards the Baku Oilfields. The discussions left Churchill feeling, as he explained in a telegram to Attlee, that there was 'an even chance' of the Caucasus being held but General Brooke 'will not go as far as this'.  Stalin's Apartment  Churchill rose to leave, he was due to dine with General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders of the Polish Armed Forces in the East to discuss their deployment to the Middle East. Stalin asked when he and Churchill would meet again. To this Churchill explained that he would be leaving at dawn. Stalin met this news with the question, \\"Why do you not come over to my apartment in the Kremlin and have some drinks?\\" Churchill consented and Stalin led the way to his apartment, which Churchill described as being 'of moderate size, simple, dignified, and four in number'. They were joined by his daughter Svetlana and Molotov. When Churchill realised he was to stay for a dinner and not just drinks he instructed Birse to telephone to his villa and let Anders know. The party dined and from 2.30 until 2.30 the following morning [16 August]. The discussions were wide- ranging, covering topics from the supply of lorries to the Red Army, the Napoleonic Wars, the Duke of Marlborough and the introduction of Collective Farms in the Soviet Union. Sir Alexander Cadogan entered at around 01.00 [16 August] with the draft communiqu√© from the conference. At this moment a suckling pig arrived, Codogan declined Stalin's invitation to join him and Stalin ate the pig by himself. Cadogan described the scene in a letter to Lord Halifax - The Soviet leader then went to an adjoining room to receive reports from the front. When he returned at around 2.30 the final communiqu√© had been agreed and Churchill took his leave. He had a 30 minutes drive to the villa, General Anders to meet and a 'splitting headache, which for me [Churchill] was very unusual'. After this there was the long drive back to the airport for his return to the UK.  16 August 1942  Churchill finally made it back to State Villa No. 7 at 03.15 on the morning of 16 August. General Anders was still awaiting the Prime Minister along with the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) General Brooke. Churchill said, \\"Ah! my poor Anders. I have been detained by M. Stalin and now I must fly off, but you come along to Cairo and we shall have a talk there\\". Anders had already flown to Moscow from Tashkent and made preparations to carry on to Cairo as if, as General Brooke recalled, 'it was in the next street'. Churchill bathed and then relayed the content of his discussions to Ambassador Clark Kerr and Colonel Jacob. Jacob recorded that, 'The Prime Minister was very tired and lay talking with his eyes shut. Nevertheless, he was very satisfied with the way things had gone, and felt that his visit had turned out a great success'. Molotov arrived at the villa at 04.30 to escort the party to the airfield where they arrived by 05.00. As dawn was breaking a band played Internationale, God Save the King and the Star Spangled Banner as the Prime Minister stood to attention and saluted. The party departed in a formation of four Liberator bombers at 05.30 after ceremonies were completed. Churchill telegraphed to Attlee - Returning via Tehran and Cairo, where he held further meetings, Churchill arrived back at RAF Lyneham to be greeted by Clementine on the evening of 24 August 1942. The Times of 18 August reported the talks. They were described as being done 'in an atmosphere of cordiality and complete sincerity'.

He served as the Bishop of Vicenza and later as the Bishop of Treviso; he is also known for ordaining the future Pope Pius X to the priesthood. He was beatified on 4 November 2001 by Pope John Paul II and was canonized on 23 November 2014 by Pope Francis following the recognition of miracles attributed to his intercession. His liturgical feast day is celebrated annually on 4 March, the date of his death. He remains the patron saint of his religious order and of his hometown as well as the dioceses in which he served. Biography Early life and family Giovanni Antonio Farina was born in Gambellara in the Venetian Province to Pedro Farina (30 January 1768 - 22 September 1864) and Francesca Bellame. Farina had ten siblings: Giacomo (b. 28 March 1792), Teresa (b. 17 March 1793), Gio Batta (b. 6 January 1795), Maddalena (b. 30 January 1796), Girolamo (b. 14 February 1801), Pietro (b. 2 March 1806), Lucia Fortunata-Farina (b. 18 August 1807), Giambattista (b. 18 October 1809), and Palma (b. 17 October 1811). Following the death of his father in 1864, Farina was mentored by his maternal uncle Antonio who was a priest. At the age of 15, he entered the seminary in Vicenza. Ministry At the age of 21, Farina began teaching at the seminary, where he continued to serve for 18 years, and he taught grammar. He was ordained to the priesthood on 15 January 1827 and remained as a teacher at the seminary and even served as a librarian for a brief period and the canon of the local cathedral. In the first decade of his priesthood, he served as a chaplain at the parish of San Pietro and was sensitive to the educational needs of its people, in particular, girls and those who were deaf and blind. In 1831, he founded the first school for poor girls in Vicenza, and on 11 November 1836, the Institute of the Sisters Teachers of Saint Dorothy, Daughters of the Sacred Hearts (). The Sisters taught at the girls' school, and also cared for the sick and the elderly. On 25 May 1850, Farina was appointed as the Bishop of Treviso.\\"Beato Giovanni Antonio Farina', Diocesi di Traviso He received his episcopal consecration as a bishop on 19 January 1851, by Giovanni Giuseppe Cappellari, the Bishop of Vicenza, assisted by Bernardo Antonino Squarcina, the Bishop of Adria, and Federico Manfredini, the Titular Bishop of Famagusta. He was formally installed in his new diocese on 16 February 1851. On 18 September 1858, Farina ordained as a priest Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, the future Pope Pius X. On 18 June 1860, Farina was appointed as the Bishop of Vicenza, a position he held until his death in 1888, and he was formally installed in his new diocese on the following 16 December. In 1869 and 1870 he attended the First Vatican Council and was among the supporters for the definition of papal infallibility. He died on 4 March 1888 at the age of 85 from a stroke. He had suffered a serious illness in 1886 and his strength continued to decline until his death. His remains were transferred to the order's motherhouse in 1898. His order received the decree of praise from Pope Gregory XVI on 1 March 1839 and papal approval from Pope Pius X later after his death on 2 May 1905. In 2005 there were 1541 religious in a total of 179 houses in nations such as Poland and in Israel. Canonization The cause for Farina's beatification started on 1 June 1990 and was therefore titled as a Servant of God. The diocesan process opened in Vicenza and spanned from 9 October 1990 until being closed on 6 February 1992; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the process in Rome on 23 April 1993 and received the Positio dossier from the postulation in 1999. The historians approved the direction of the cause on 22 February 2000 while theologians voiced their approval for the cause on 12 December 2000 as did the C.C.S. on 20 February 2001 On 24 April 2001 he was proclaimed Venerable after Pope John Paul II approved his life of \\"heroic virtue\\". The process for a miracle that led to his beatification spanned from 1985 until 1987 and received validation on 19 January 1996. A medical board approved this on 25 January 2001 as did theologians on 29 May 2001 and the C.C.S. members on 3 July 2001. The pope issued final confirmation for this miracle on 7 July 2001 and deemed it to be a healing attributed to Farina's intercession. John Paul II beatified Farina in Saint Peter's Square on 4 November 2001. March 4 was designated as his annual liturgical feast. The second miracle had to be approved for him to be sainted and one such miracle was investigated and then validated on 4 April 2003 before a medical board approved it on 14 April 2005. Theologians also assented to it on 24 January 2006 as did the C.C.S. sometime later on 18 March 2014. Pope Francis signed a decree on 3 April 2014 recognizing a miracle that had been attributed to Farina's intercession and allowed for his canonization to take place. He was canonized - alongside five others - on 23 November 2014 in Saint Peter's Square.Rite of canonization of blesseds: Giovanni Antonio Farina, Kuriakose Elias Chavara of the holy family, Ludovico of Casoria, Nicola of Longobardi, Euphrasia Eluvathingal of the sacred heart, Amato Ronconi The postulator at the time of his canonization was Sr. Albarosa Ines Bassani. Lineage His paternal grandparents were Girolamo (9 January 1738 - 18 December 1822) and Maddalena Disconzi (1734 - 31 October 1815).

He was a college basketball head coach for 24 seasons: five at the University of Montana and nineteen at Michigan State University Heathcote coached Magic Johnson during his two years at Michigan State, concluding with the 1979 national championship season. He also coached the University of Montana to a national handball championship in 1974.

In his third season in East Lansing, he guided the Spartans to the NCAA championship. Led on the court by sophomore Magic Johnson, MSU defeated the Larry Bird-led Indiana State Sycamores in the title game in In his nineteen years at Michigan State, the Spartans made nine NCAA Tournament appearances and three National Invitation Tournament (NIT) appearances. As a coach, Heathcote was particularly noted for his excellent defensive strategies on the court and was second to none in blocking the opposing team from penetrating to the hoop. Heathcote retired after the 1994‚Äì95 season, having won 418 games and lost 275, for a .603 winning percentage. He was succeeded by Tom Izzo, a thirteen-year assistant coach and associate head coach for Heathcote's final five seasons. Retirement After retiring from coaching, Heathcote returned to Spokane, where he lived until his death. He played handball until well into his seventies, and continued to play recreational golf.

The station is situated on the Atlantic Coast Line, measured from . All trains are operated by and the station is managed by Great Western Railway. History Bugle station circa 1910. The first railway here was a horse-worked line from Par Harbour to \\"near the Bugle Inn\\" at Molinnis. It was built by Joseph Treffry and opened on 18 May 1847. On 1 June 1874 a new line was opened by the Cornwall Minerals Railway. Running beyond Par to Fowey, and continuing past Molinnis to join up with another of Treffry's tramways to Newquay. A passenger service was introduced on 20 June 1876 when a station with a single platform on the north side of the line was provided at Bugle. The line from Bugle eastwards to Goonbarrow Junction was doubled on 20 July 1930, with the new line passing behind the platform to create an island platform. From 29 November 1964 the original line was only used only for freight trains to reach the Carbis branch. This meant that all passenger trains now use the 1930 platform face. The Carbis branch closed on 25 August 1989 leaving just a single track through the station and all the way to Newquay, which sets the low frequency of train service which is possible on the branch. Services Bugle is a request stop on the line, so passengers wishing to alight must inform the conductor, and passengers wishing to join the train must signal to the driver. The typical service is one train every two hours in each direction between Par and Newquay, with some services extending to Plymouth and one train in the summer extending to Penzance. On summer Saturdays, there is just one train per day in each direction due to the intercity services running through to Newquay in lieu of the local services. Trains are usually operated by Class 150 Sprinters. Community rail The trains between Par and Newquay are designated as a community rail service and is supported by marketing provided by the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership. The line is promoted under the \\"Atlantic Coast Line\\" name. The Bugle Inn is part of the Atlantic Coast Line rail ale trail.

It was composed of major diplomats, ministers and generals, who discussed cooperation in the war effort, and issued the Moscow Declaration. History A series of twelve meetings took place between the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom (Anthony Eden), the United States (Cordell Hull), and the Soviet Union (Vyacheslav Molotov), resulted in the Moscow Declarations and the creation of the European Advisory Commission. During the Moscow Conference of 1943, the Soviet Union finally came to agreement with the United States and its allies to create a world organization, the European Advisory Commission. The Ambassador of Republic of China in the Soviet Union, Foo Ping-sheung, was invited to sign the Declaration of the Four Nations. Among those who also attended for the United States were Ambassador of the United States W. Averell Harriman, Major General John R. Deane of the United States Army, Green H. Hackworth, and James C. Dunn; for the United Kingdom, His Majesty's Ambassador Sir Archibald Clerk Kerr, William Strang, and Lt. General Sir Hastings Ismay; for the Soviet Union, the Marshal of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin, K. E. Voroshilov, A. Y. Vyshinski, Deputy People's Commissars for Foreign Affairs M. M. Litvinov, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Trade V. A. Sergeyev, Major-General A. A. Gryslov of the General Staff, and Senior Official of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs G. F. Saksin. Objectives of the Conference The Third Moscow Conference was one of the first times in which foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union could meet and discuss important global matters. Here, they discussed what measures needed to be taken in order to shorten and end the war with Germany and the Axis Powers, as well as how to effectively collaborate and cooperate peacefully through this period marking the end of the war. The Moscow Declaration, officially issued by the foreign ministers of United States President Franklin Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom, and Premier Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union, defined how these issues would be dealt with. It included four sections, Declaration of Four Nations on General Security, Declaration Regarding Italy, Declaration on Austria, and Statement on Atrocities. Also during the Moscow Conference, agreements were made to establish a European Advisory Commission to make recommendations for the three joint governments and an Advisory Council regarding Italy - along with Greece and Yugoslavia. In the case of Italy, the declaration stated that Fascism must be utterly destroyed in Italy, that all fascists should be barred from participation in public life and that \\"democratic organs\\" of local government should be created within Italy by the occupying powers. In the case of Austria, the German annexation of Austria in 1938 was declared null and void. But the people of Austria as a whole were held responsible in the declaration for participation in the war on the side of Germany. In the \\"Statement on Atrocities\\", it was declared that after any armistice with the present or a future German government, that those German individuals suspected of involvement in wartime atrocities in various countries would be sent to those countries for trial and punishment.

Generally, the show followed a format of short weekday shows, with a Sunday special each week called The Tree House Family. History Originally, Tingha and Tucker were simply stuffed toy koalas belonging to host Jean Morton, who would speak to them on air. Soon, puppets were made of the characters so that they could be more lifelike. The show was a great success and like many shows of its era had a \\"club\\", the Tingha and Tucker Club, which at its height had 750,000 members. The club eventually had to close when it became unable to handle the volume of mail it generated. One of the favourite show songs was \\"The Wibbly Wobbly Way\\". The show was eventually cancelled in 1970 after eight years. The Tingha and Tucker puppets used on the air were reportedly stolen from storage shortly after and have never been recovered.

These include CD-ROM music albums containing video files viewable on a personal computer, or feature film Blu-rays containing interactive content when used with a PlayStation 3 game console. Multiple file systems A hybrid disc is an optical disc that has multiple file systems installed on it, typically ISO 9660 and HFS+ (or HFS on older discs). One reason for the hybrid format is the restrictions of ISO 9660 (filenames of only eight characters, and a maximum depths of eight directories, similar to the Microsoft FAT file system). Another key factor is that ISO 9660 does not support resource forks, which is critical to the classic Mac OS' software design (OS X or macOS removed much of the need for resource forks in application design). Companies that released products for both DOS (later Windows) and the classic Mac OS (later macOS) could release a CD containing software for both, natively readable on either system. Data files can even be shared by both partitions, while keeping the platform specific data separate. In a \\"true\\" (or \\"shared\\") hybrid HFS filesystem, files common to both the ISO 9660 and HFS partitions are stored only once, with the ISO 9660 partition pointing to file content in the HFS area (or vice versa). Blizzard Entertainment has released most of their computer games on hybrid CDs. By default, Mac OS 9 and macOS burn hybrid discs. An ISO 9660/HFS hybrid disc has an ISO 9660 primary volume descriptor, which makes it a valid ISO 9660 disc, and an Apple partition. It may also have an Apple partition map, although this is not necessary. The ISO 9660 portion of the disc can co-exist with an Apple partition because the header areas which define the contents of the disc are located in different places. The ISO 9660 primary volume descriptor begins 32,768 bytes (32 KB) into the disc. If present, an Apple partition map begins 512 bytes into the disc; if there is no partition map, the header for an Apple HFS partition (known as a Master Directory Block, or MDB) begins 1,024 bytes into the disc. Audio CD with added data tracks Hybrid-CD also refers to an audio CD which also includes a data track storing MP3 (or other digital audio compression format) copy of those CD-DA tracks. Before the introduction and subsequent popularization of iTunes and the iPod, such discs were popular for sharing music on compact disc without requiring the recipient to extract and encode the CD-DA themselves ‚Äî a technical and perhaps time-consuming process on older computing hardware. However, with the advent of faster computing hardware and vastly simplified automated extraction and encoding tools (e.g. iTunes, Rhythmbox, etc.) and the lack of an automated hybrid feature in that very same software, popularity of such hybrid CD has subsequently declined. However, such hybrid discs do remain in a commercial setting as a digital rights management enforcement technique, where encrypted compressed copies of the digital audio are provided with proprietary software for listening in a computer disc drive, while the CD-DA is included for playback in stand-alone CD players. Hybrid Blu-rays In recent years, some Blu-rays have been released as Hybrid discs, demonstrating its compatibility with the PlayStation 3 console, which uses BD as its primary disc format. These discs generally include a movie or feature that can be played on any Blu-ray Disc player and playable content which is accessible when run on a PlayStation 3 console. Examples include Tekken Hybrid, Macross Frontier: Itsuwari no Utahime and Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne -Kamogawa Days-.

The plot concerns a man, Bradley Brinkman, who signs an agreement with an agent of the devil, which grants him a transformed body and a new identity, Hunk Golden. He must decide whether to continue living in this new body or return to his old one. Plot After his girlfriend elopes with her aerobics instructor, Bradley Brinkman (Steve Levitt) spends so much time daydreaming of being a confident, sexy, and powerful man that he is about to lose his job. While desperately trying to meet a deadline he types, \\"I'd sell my soul for a money making program,\\" into the computer. The computer prints \\"The Yuppie Program\\", which becomes hugely popular and gains him a large bonus and a paid summer off to write anything he wants. Bradley spends his entire bonus renting a run-down beach house in a very high-end part of California coastline. He first sees O'Brien (Deborah Shelton), the devil's agent, while taking a walk on the beach with his new neighbor Chachka (Cynthia Szigeti), who introduces him to his highly stuck-up yuppie neighbors who verbally and physically abuse him. His further attempts to socialize with his neighbors and live a rich yuppie lifestyle are mocked and when he throws a house party that no one else comes to, O'Brien appears again and explains that she occupied his computer and wrote the Yuppie Program for him. She offers to make him a \\"hunk\\", the kind of man women want and men want to be, in exchange for his soul. This includes a \\"sell your soul for the summer\\" trial, where he can get his previous body and his soul refunded if he is not satisfied with the deal. Without really taking it seriously, he signs the contract. He wakes up the next day as Hunk Golden (John Allen Nelson), in a transformed body. After a day, O'Brien steps in and actively helps him become his new persona. As Hunk Golden he is a natural martial arts master, can eat anything and not gain weight, drink without getting drunk, has self-cleaning teeth and unbreakable bones. Women flock to have sex with him. He sets fashion trends. As the deadline to finalize the deal (Labor Day) approaches, Hunk seeks help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Sunny Graves, (Rebeccah Bush), to try and save his old soul and body. She tells him to embrace being the hunk that he is, while she helps him with his apparent delusion of being Bradley Brinkman. After another night of sex with a random woman, O'Brien introduces Hunk to the chairman of the board of the Devil Himself Incorporated, Dr. D (James Coco), currently in the form of Atilla the Hun. Hunk notices that he also looks like Captain Kravitz, the former owner of the beach house. He tells Hunk there is a vast demon shortage and Dr. D plans to have him working with some of the worst killers in history, like Ivan the Terrible, Jack the Ripper and Benito Mussolini. After Dr. D leaves, O'Brien romanticizes the two of them bombing Pearl Harbor together as a pair of time- traveling Satanic salespeople. While at the beachfront with Sunny, a drunk television host Garrison Gaylord (Robert Morse) is about to hit them and drive his Jeep off the pier when Hunk turns and stops it with his bare hands. Gaylord's television director (J. Jay Saunders) catches the entire incident on film and Hunk becomes an instant celebrity. Sunny and Hunk kiss, but after he leaves Dr. D appears in Sunny's office, dressed as Adolf Hitler. Sunny is revealed to be O'Brien. Dr. D chastizes her for falling in love with another client. He warns her that her own deal is coming due, and if she does not deliver Bradley's soul, she will be reverted to who she formerly was. Hunk struggles with changes in his personality, leading him to turn a garden hose on his fans in rage. Hunk dreams about Bradley escaping from hell and warning him not to take the deal, and later of helping Dr. D start World War III. Finally, Bradley and Sunny meeting with Dr. D, and Bradley chooses to give up being Hunk and not take the deal. Dr. D reveals the truth about Sunny, and offers them both a 6-months extension on their contracts. Bradley refuses and finally convinces O'Brien to do the same. She is reverted into her original self, a 10th Century princess who sold her soul to avoid a Viking marriage her father sold her into, which inspires Bradley to create the Princess Program.

More information on the history of the various flags and emblems, as well as on their equivalents which are no longer in use, is found on the specific articles, linked to in the subtitle headings. National flag and coat of arms The National Flag of Malta is defined in the Constitution and consists of two equal vertical stripes, white in the hoist and red in the fly, with a representation of the George Cross, edged with red, in the canton of the white stripe; the breadth of the flag is one and a half times its height. It was adopted when Malta became independent from the United Kingdom on 21 September 1964. The George Cross decoration was awarded by King George VI for collective gallantry in 1942. Malta remained the only collective awardee of the decoration until it was awarded to the Royal Ulster Constabulary of Northern Ireland in 1999. The current emblem of Malta is described by the Emblem and Public Seal of Malta Act (1988) as a shield showing an heraldic representation of the National Flag; above the shield a mural crown in gold with a sally port and eight turrets (five only being visible) representing the fortifications of Malta and denoting a City State; and around the shield a wreath of two branches: the dexter of Olive, the sinister of Palm, symbols of peace and courage to victory traditionally associated with Malta, all in their proper colours, tied at base with a white ribbon, backed red and upon which are written the words in capital letters in black.

The only flag used in Malta in the time of the Knights consisted of a white symmetrical cross on a red field with the cross having a width of 1/5 the height of the flag - similar to the flag of England, colors reversed with a proportion of 5:3. It says that Malta switched flags with Denmark in the early days. The flag is still used by the Knights' modern successor, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.

It is the Naval Component Command of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM). The Fourth Fleet is headquartered at Naval Station Mayport in Jacksonville, Florida. It is responsible for U.S. Navy ships, aircraft and submarines operating in the Caribbean Sea, and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans around Central and South America.  History  World War II The 4th Fleet was a major U.S. Navy formation in the South Atlantic Ocean during World War II. It was originally established to protect the U.S. against Axis surface raiders, blockade runners, and submarines. The Fleet was originally a redesignation of the South Atlantic Force. On 12 September 1942, the Brazilian Navy was placed under command of the U.S. Navy's Vice Admiral Jonas Ingram by order of the Brazilian President Vargas. Three days later, on 15 September 1942, Vice Admiral Ingram was appointed as Commander, South Atlantic Force (ComSoLant). Six months later, South Atlantic Force was redesignated the U.S. Fourth Fleet on 15 March 1943.http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin- Hist/146-SouthAtlantic/146-SoLant-Chron.html The Fleet worked with Brazil in the South Atlantic using Atlantic Ocean bases at Recife and elsewhere. The fleet was later commanded by Vice Admiral William Munroe. In all, forces deployed to the 4th Fleet sank 18 German U-boats and one Italian submarine, along with sinking or stopping Axis blockade runners. Three years after its establishment, on April 15, 1945, the Fourth Fleet was dissolved and renamed Task Force 27. Admiral Munroe kept the title and command of Commander, South Atlantic Force. In 1946, the U.S. 4th Reserve Fleet was formed to maintain readiness for war; it was disestablished on January 1, 1947. 2008 reactivation On 24 April 2008, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead announced the reestablishment of the Fourth Fleet. Its formal reestablishment took place on 12 July 2008 at a ceremony at Naval Station Mayport, Florida. The announcement was made before informing foreign governments in the region, several of which expressed concern. The governments of Argentina and Brazil made formal inquiries as to the fleet's mission in the region. In Venezuela, President Hugo Ch√°vez accused the United States of attempting to frighten the people of South America and vowed that his country's new Sukhoi Su-30 jets could sink any U.S. ships invading Venezuelan waters. Cuban president Fidel Castro warned that it could lead to more incidents such as the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis.  Mission  The Fourth Fleet's area of responsibility, 2009. U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command (USNAVSO) and the Fourth Fleet support USSOUTHCOM joint and combined full- spectrum military operations. They do this by providing principally sea-based forward presence to ensure freedom of maneuver in the maritime domain, to foster and sustain cooperative relationships with international partners, and to fully exploit the sea as maneuver space in order to enhance regional security and promote peace, stability, and prosperity in the Caribbean, Central American, and South American regions. The Fleet has five missions: support for peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, traditional maritime exercises, and counterdrug support operations.  Organization  Commander, Task Force 41, Rear Admiral Thomas, shakes hands with Commanding Officer, USS Gunston Hall, in Haiti, on 5 February 2010. Fourth Fleet units were deployed to assist after the earthquake there. Commander, USNAVSO (COMUSNAVSO) also serves as the Navy component commander for USSOUTHCOM. U.S. Fourth Fleet is responsible for U.S. Navy ships, aircraft and submarines operating in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility, which encompasses the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and surrounding waters. It is an organizational fleet staffed to fulfill a planning and coordination mission; as part of its 2008 reestablishment, no vessels are permanently assigned to the Fourth Fleet. Ships home-ported in the United States Fleet Forces Command and United States Third Fleet routinely deploy to the Fourth Fleet area of responsibility (AOR), during which time they are under the operational control of the Fourth Fleet commander.

The speeches, which were concurrent with Cicero's election to the aedileship, paved the way for Cicero's public career.  Background to the case  During the Civil War between Marius and Sulla (88‚Äì87 BC), Verres had been a junior officer in a Marian legion under Gaius Papirius Carbo. He saw the tides of the war shifting to Sulla, and so, Cicero alleged, went over to Sulla's lines bearing his legion's paychest.In Verrem I.11 Afterwards, he was protected to a degree by Sulla, and allowed to indulge a skill for gubernatorial extortion in Cilicia under the province's governor, Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella in 81 BC. By 73 BC he had been placed as governor of Sicily, one of the key grain-producing provinces of the Republic (Egypt at this time was still an independent Hellenistic kingdom). In Sicily, Verres was alleged to have despoiled temples and used a number of national emergencies, including the Third Servile War, as cover for elaborate extortion plots.In Verrem I.14‚Äì16, II.5‚Äì12 At the same time, Marcus Tullius Cicero was an up-and- coming political figure. After defending Sextus Roscius of Ameria in 80 BC on a highly politically charged case of parricide, Cicero left for a voyage to Greece and Rhodes. There, he learned a new and less-strenuous form of oratory from Molon of Rhodes before rushing back into the political arena upon Sulla's death. Cicero would serve in Sicily in 75 BC as a quaestor, and in doing so made contacts with a number of Sicilian towns. In fact a large amount of his clientele at the time came from Sicily, a link that would prove invaluable in 70 BC, when a deputation of Sicilians asked Cicero to level a prosecution against Verres for his alleged crimes on the island.  First speech  The first speech was the only one to be delivered in front of the praetor urbanus Manius Acilius Glabrio. In it, Cicero took advantage of the almost unconditional freedom to speak in court to demolish Verres' case. Cicero touched very little on Verres' extortion crimes in Sicily in the first speech. Instead, he took a two-pronged approach, by both inflating the vanity of the all-senator jury and making the most of Verres' early character. The second approach concerned Verres' defense's attempts to keep the case from proceeding on technicalities. Verres had secured the services of the finest orator of his day, Quintus Hortensius Hortalus for his defense. Immediately, both Verres and Hortensius realized that the court as composed under Glabrio was inhospitable to the defense, and began to try to derail the prosecution by procedural tricks that had the effect of delaying or prolonging the trial. This was done by first trying to place a similar prosecution on the docket, to take place before Verres' trial, one concerning a governor of Bithynia for extortion. The point of the attempted derailment of the case hinged on Roman custom. At the time the case was being argued, the year was coming to a close and soon a number of public festivals (including one in honor of Pompey the Great) would commence. All work ceased on festival days, according to Roman customs, including any ongoing trials. Cicero alleged that Hortensius was hoping to draw the trial out long enough to run into the festival period before Cicero would have an opportunity to conclude his case, thereby making it a statistical impossibility that Glabrio and the jury would deliver a verdict before the new year, when the magistrates were replaced with their newly elected successors. Hortensius and Verres both knew, Cicero argued, that Marcus Metellus, a friend and ally of Verres, would be in charge of the extortion court in the new year, and so saw a benefit to such a gaming of the system. In addition, Hortensius himself, along with Quintus Metellus, Marcus's older brother, had been elected consuls for the same year, and would thus be in prime position to intimidate the witnesses when the case resumed after the expected lull. As such, Verres and his supporters were supremely confident of victory. Indeed, Cicero remarked that, immediately after the election of Hortensius and Metellus, one of his friends had heard the former consul Gaius Scribonius Curio publicly congratulate Verres, declaring that he was now as good as acquitted. Cicero, too, had a unique strategy in mind for his prosecution. In 81 BC, the Dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix had changed the composition of criminal courts, allowing only Senators to serve as jurymen. This had, apparently, caused friction and at least the appearance of \\"bought\\" justice, particularly when Senators were the accused, or the interests of a popular or powerful Senator were threatened. There had also been, concurrent with this, an almost perpetual scandal of wealthy senators and knights bribing juries to gain verdicts favorable to them. By 70, as the trial against Verres was proceeding, Lucius Aurelius Cotta had introduced a law that would reverse Sulla's restrictions on jury composition, once again opening the juries up to Senators, Equites and tribuni aerarii as a check on such over-lenient juries. Cicero devoted a significant amount of time in his oration to the perception of Senatorial juries, arguing that not only was Verres on trial for his malfeasance in Sicily, but the Senate was on trial as well for charges of impropriety, and that whatever verdict they handed down to Verres would reflect on them to either their credit or shame. The surest way, Cicero argued, to get the Lex Aurelia passed and take the juries away from the Senate was to acquit Verres on all charges. Further, to counteract Hortensius' attempts to draw the trial out, Cicero begged the court's indulgence to allow him to alter the trial's flow from the usual format. In normal trials, both prosecution and defense would make a series of adversarial speeches before witnesses were called. Cicero realized that this would inevitably drag out the proceedings past the new year, and so he requested that he be allowed to call witnesses immediately to buttress his charges, before the speeches were made.In Verrem I.54‚Äì55  Outline of the main charges in second speech  The first speech had touched more on the sharp practice of Verres and his attorney, Hortensius, in trying to derail or delay the trial. In the second, infinitely more damning speech, Cicero laid out the full charge sheet. The second speech apparently was meant to have been his rebuttal speech had the trial continued, as it alludes to witnesses as already having testified in front of Glabrio's court. Cicero enumerated a number of charges against Verres during his tenure as governor of Sicily. The main ones that serve as the greatest portion of the text concern a naval scandal that Verres had fomented as a complex means of embezzlement. These were that he subverted Roman security by accepting a bribe from the city of Messana to release them from their duty of providing a ship for the Roman fleet and that he fraudulently discharged men from fleet service, did not mark them down as discharged, and pocketed their active duty pay. Pirates that were captured were sometimes sold under the table by Verres as slaves, rather than being executed, as Cicero argues was the proper punishment. To camouflage the fact that this was going on, Cicero further accuses Verres of administratively shuffling around the pirates to cities that had no knowledge of them and substituting others in their place on the execution block. Moreover, Cicero alleges that Verres placed a crony of his, Cleomenes by name, as commander of a fleet expedition to destroy a group of pirates in the area (the reason being, Cicero argues, to keep him out of reach as Verres cuckolded him) and that Cleomenes, due to incompetence, allowed the pirates to enter into Syracuse harbor and sack the town. Further, after the abject failure of Cleomenes' expedition, to keep the blame off himself for allowing the fleet to go out undermanned and ill-led, Verres ordered all the ships' captains except for Cleomenes to be executed. More charges were levelled outside of this naval affair. They include: * A scheme of extortion centered on the Third Servile War, in which Verres allegedly would accuse key slaves of wealthy landowners of being in league with the rebelling slaves on the mainland, arresting them and then soliciting large bribes to void the charges; * He ordered ships that had valuable cargoes impounded as allegedly belonging to the rebel Quintus Sertorius. Passengers and crew on board the ships were then thrown in a prison created out of an old rock quarry by the tyrant Dionysius I in Syracuse, and were executed without trial as alleged sympathizers or soldiers of Sertorius. ** one prisoner of Verres' scheme, Publius Gavius, a Roman citizen of Compsa, escaped and protested about Verres' treatment of Roman citizens. Verres had the man flogged, and then he had him crucified, both punishments not to be inflicted on a Roman citizen without a trial in Rome (and even then, an execution by crucifixion was never to be performed on a Roman citizen). To add to the humiliation, Verres was alleged to have placed the cross bearing Gavius on a spot where the coastline of mainland Italy (symbolically the border of Verres' power) could be seen by him as he died. * He ordered his lictors and his chief lictor, Sextus in particular, to beat an elderly man of Panormus, a Roman citizen named Gaius Servilius, to near-death for criticizing Verres' rule. Servilius later died of his injuries.  Outcome of the speeches  Of the planned orators, only Cicero had an opportunity to speak. Cicero detailed Verres' early crimes and Verres' attempts to derail the trial. Soon after the court heard Cicero's speeches, Hortensius advised Verres that it would be hard for him to win at this point, and further advised that the best course of action was for Verres to essentially plead no contest by going into voluntary exile (an option open to higher-ranking Romans in his situation). By the end of 70 BC, Verres was living in exile in Massilia, modern-day Marseilles, where he would live the rest of his life (history records he was killed during the proscriptions of the Second Triumvirate over a sculpture desired by Mark Antony). Cicero collected the remaining material, including what was to be his second speech dealing with Verres' actions in Sicily, and published it as if it had actually been delivered in court. Further, due to the legal system in Rome, Senators who won prosecutions were entitled to the accused's position in the Senate. This gave Cicero's career a boost, in a large part because this allowed him a freedom to speak not usually granted to a newly enrolled member of the Senate.

It crosses the River Foyle further south than the Foyle Bridge and Peace Bridge. It is one of only a few double-decker road bridges in Europe. It was named after Lord Craigavon, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. The present bridge was designed by the City Architect, Matthew A Robinson. Construction began in the late 1920s and was finished in 1933. The lower deck of the bridge originally carried a railway line for freight wagons, but that was replaced by a road in 1968. At each end, a silhouetted mural of a railway station stands to mark the former railway. On 3 July 1968, as part of a series of protests against housing conditions in Derry, the Derry Housing Action Committee (DHAC) held a sit-down protest on the newly opened second deck of the Craigavon Bridge. A pair of bronze statues forming a sculpture entitled Hands Across the Divide are situated at the west end of Craigavon Bridge in Carlisle Square and were produced by Derry sculptor Maurice Harron. Refurbishment thumb Between October 1999 and August 2000, the Roads Service of the Department for Regional Development, in Phase I of a refurbishment project, concentrated on the renovation of the upper deck of the bridge, to prolong its service life and to provide increased safety. That included repairs to the concrete and steelwork, re-waterproofing the deck to protect the steelwork from corrosion, and resurfacing both the carriageway and footways. Later phases II and III concentrated on the refurbishment of the lower deck and the painting of the bridge. The total cost of refurbishing Craigavon Bridge was ¬£4¬∑2 million. History Craigavon Bridge is one of three bridges to be built in the area. The first bridge over the River Foyle was a wooden one, assembled in the United States and transported to Derry. It was built from 1789‚Äì1791, and sited between Bridge Street and Fountain Hill, about 90 metres north of the present bridge. The structure included a drawbridge because the inhabitants of Strabane had navigational rights on the river. In 1863, the steel Carlisle Bridge was erected, a little further upstream, almost where Craigavon Bridge is today, to replace the old wooden bridge.

He also was a longtime manager in minor league baseball. He was born in Janesville, Wisconsin. Cantillon, a second baseman who played in the 19th-century minor leagues, is one of the handful of men who both umpired and managed in the majors. He officiated in the American League in and the National League for part of the season. He was a controversial umpire who had to be removed from the field on some occasions, including a game in Boston where fans attacked him (he had to be rescued by Chick Stahl and Parson Lewis).Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) In Cantillon became the manager of the Washington Senators, but his tenure there was disastrous. In Cantillon's three years in Washington, his team never finished higher than seventh place in the AL, and lost 100 games twice. The only bright spot was the discovery of Walter Johnson, who would become perhaps the greatest pitcher in American League history. After the season, Cantillon was fired. He finished his big league managerial career with a 158‚Äì297 record (a .347 winning percentage).Retrosheet Cantillon's minor league managerial career stretched back to 1893, when he was skipper of the Oakland Colonels of the California League; his team finished first that season. He managed in the old Western Association sporadically in the late 1890s. After his two years as an umpire, Cantillon resumed his minor league managerial career with the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association from 1903‚Äì06, his team never finishing below third place.Johnson, Lloyd, and Wolff, Miles, eds., The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball, 1997 edition.

Owned by American Electric Power (AEP), it has one of the tallest chimneys in the world at . This chimney was built as part of the plant in 1980 and is not in use now. It has been replaced by a slightly shorter and wider chimney for the electrostatic precipitator and scrubber units. The AEP Mountaineer Plant is what is known as a 1300 megawatt plant. The actual total capacity of the plant's two turbines is around 1480 MW, and the plant averages around 1420 MW. 1300 MW is the net power that actually leaves the plant, whereas the difference between the turbine output and the 1300 MW is required to run the plant itself. It is a \\"closed-loop\\" plant in that it recycles the cooling water used, however it requires approximately per hour of \\"make up\\" water to be drawn from the Ohio River to replace the water that is lost in water vapor through the cooling tower and the precipitator/scrubber chimney. The plant burns an average of 9,000 tons (8,200 metric tons) of coal per day, and some of that coal now comes via barge on the Ohio River to an elaborate coal unloading and storage facility. The other portion of coal comes from Big River Mining. An underground coal mine right across the street from the plant. It is mined, cleaned, processed, and shipped by a belt line across the street to the power plant. This single boiler, dual turbine plant produces enough energy to power a city approximately the size of Columbus, Ohio. The plant is connected to the grid by 765 kilovolt transmission lines (the highest rated voltage used in the United States). The location of the plant is routinely given as New Haven, West Virginia, yet sits just outside the town limits. The plant actually sits on land that was originally known as Graham Station. The next-door Phillip Sporn AEP plant and the Mountaineer Plant seem to cover most of the land of the former Graham Station, thus Graham Station is seldom used as a locale. Clean coal project There were plans to outfit the plant with technology that uses chilled ammonia to trap carbon dioxide. The greenhouse gas would then be turned into a liquid and injected into the ground. It would have been the first such project that will both capture and store carbon from an existing power plant. A successful pilot project was built using the new technology which removed 100,000 to 300,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide of the 8.5 million tons emitted annually by the Mountaineer plant. According to The New York Times, AEP and the maker of the technology, Alstom, spent $100 million on the initiative. However, the political climate had changed by July, 2011 and the project was abandoned due to diminishing federal and state support for clean coal technology.

He was best known for his role as Ted Bullpitt in the 1980s television situation comedy series Kingswood Country and brief revival Bullpitt!. He was also a commercial advertiser who provided the voice of animated character \\"Louie the Fly\\" in the television ad campaign for Mortein, over a 50-year period (the longest running such ad in Australia) as well as Mr. Pound, when decimal currency was first introduced in Australia Early career: radio and recording Higgins' entertainment industry career began in 1946, when he took a cadetship at Sydney's 2GB commercial radio station at the age of 15. This led to an on-air announcing position and hosting of breakfast and, later, evening variety shows. A trained singer, he soon began recording singles which lifted his profile around Australia. His flair for comedy came to the fore in the 1950s when he became a cast member of the very popular The Jack Davey Show. He moved between commercial radio and the ABC, touring the country, hosting and singing with the ABC show band. It was during this period he performed with luminaries such as Peter Dawson, Slim Dusty and Mel Torm√©. His radio career reached a peak in the mid-1950s and, when television arrived in 1956, he successfully made the transition, appearing on variety shows, hosting game shows on the 7 Network and in the early 1960s on Singalong and Bobby Limb's Sound of Music on the 9 Network. Voice over During the 1960s, Higgins consolidated his position as a leading voiceover artist, creating character voices for TV and radio ads and cartoons. His earliest character voice‚Äî\\"Louie the Fly\\"Louie the Fly. Straight from rubbish tip to you! (an animated fly for the Mortein fly-spray commercials), was recorded by him as late as 2011. It is now the longest continuously running campaign in television history, having run for over 50 years (1957‚Äì2011). Theatre During the mid-1960s, Higgins worked in theatre, doing several back-to-back seasons at Sydney's Menzies Theatre Restaurant‚Äîa popular nightspot where musicals were staged under the direction of Hayes Gordon. Television Higgins had an ongoing role playing a priest in the early Australian soap opera Motel in 1968. He also had guest roles in various series, including Division 4 and Skippy. Throughout the 1970s, he and voiceover colleague Kevin Golsby dominated Australian airwaves in the voiceover field. While enjoying this success, another break-through role came in 1977 when he and Golsby were key regular performers in sketch comedy series The Naked Vicar Show. He played various characters in the series, which lasted two seasons. In 1980, a spin- off series based on a bombastic Holden Kingswood driving character he had portrayed in one sketch of The Naked Vicar Show was created. Titled Kingswood Country, the series had a successful five-year run, completing five-and-a-half seasons. Higgins played a straight dramatic role in the soap opera Richmond Hill (1988). His character, a dour policeman, was the show's main authority figure. The series was cancelled at the end of 1988. In 1992, he starred in the Ten Network's sitcom Late for School (which launched the TV careers of Matthew Newton and Stephen Curry). Higgins' most recent role was a reprise of the Ted Bullpitt character in the situation comedy Bullpitt! in 1997, which had two seasons on the 7 Network. Kingswood Country has since found new audiences via cable TV and DVD. Recording Higgins used his vocal talents on thousands of projects during his 60 years in radio and television, including recording the song \\"Monster Mash\\" for ABC For Kids Video Hits, recording an album of himself reading the classic Australian children's story \\"Blinky Bill\\". Personal life and death Higgins and his wife Nadine had four children. Higgins died of unspecified causes on 7 October 2016, aged 85. He had been ill for some time and had been hospitalised for several weeks.

The station is situated on the Atlantic Coast Line, measured from . The station is managed and served by Great Western Railway local trains. History The Cornwall Minerals Railway opened its line from Fowey to Newquay on 1 June 1874. The trains at first carried only goods traffic and a depot was provided at Holywell. A passenger service was introduced on 20 June 1876 when the depot was renamed \\"Victoria\\", which gave its name to the modern hamlet on the site, and then changed to \\"Roche\\" on 1 May 1904. The passing loop was extended on 3 July 1936 to accommodate the longer holiday trains then using the line. It was closed on 3 January 1965 when the goods yard was closed. For a while trains used the old westbound platform but on 12 July 1965 this was changed to the eastbound platform and the westbound track was then removed. Services Roche is a request stop on the line, so passengers wishing to alight must inform the conductor and passengers wishing to join the train must signal to the driver. The typical service is one train every two hours in each direction between Par and Newquay, with some services extending to Plymouth and one train in the summer extending to Penzance. On summer Saturdays, there is just one train per day in each direction due to the intercity services running through to Newquay in lieu of the local services. Trains are usually operated by Class 150 Sprinters. Community rail The trains between Par and Newquay are designated as a community rail service and is supported by marketing provided by the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership. The line is promoted under the \\"Atlantic Coast Line\\" name. The Victoria Inn at Roche is part of the Atlantic Coast Line rail ale trail.

The fish is nocturnal and shelters in caves and under ledges during the day. Morphology The pineconefish is yellow with distinct large scales outlined in black. It has light-producing organs filled with luminescent bacteria on each side of the lower jaw, the purpose of which is not known, but may help it to see at night or to attract prey. The fish grows to 17 cm, but is more commonly found up to 12 cm. Pinecone fish do not have scales, and are instead covered in scutes. Scutes are similar to scales and serve the same function. Unlike the scales of fish, which are formed from the epidermis, scutes are formed in the lower vascular layer of the skin and the epidermal element is only the top surface. Forming in the living dermis, the scutes produce a horny outer layer, that is superficially similar to that of scales. Scute comes from Latin for shield, and can take the form of: * an external shield-like bony plate, or * a modified, thickened scale that often is keeled or spiny, or * a projecting, modified (rough and strongly ridged) scale, usually associated with the lateral line, or on the caudal peduncle forming caudal keels, or along the ventral profile. In captivity Pinecone fish are often kept by aquarists because they are not aggressive and easy to keep. In aquaria, they are usually fed fresh marine foods or brine shrimp.

It was originally performed by Mary Martin, who played Dolly Winslow, the young \\"prot√©g√©e\\" of a rich newspaper publisher. In the original context, Dolly is stranded at a Siberian railway station, wearing only a fur coat, and performs a striptease while singing the song. Surrounded by eager Siberian men, she says that since she has met \\"daddy\\", she will flirt with other men, but won't \\"follow through\\". \\"Daddy\\" is her sugar daddy, a newspaper magnate introduced with the words, \\"I've come to care, for such a sweet millionaire\\". Later versions Martin sang it again in the 1940 movie Love Thy Neighbor. Again she wears a fur coat, but the setting is a show within a show and the act is more conventional as she wears an evening gown beneath the fur. The words to the introduction are altered, the innuendoes being toned down. Her best-known movie performance is in the 1946 Cole Porter biopic Night and Day in which she plays herself. The film recreates Martin's audition then segues into her performance in the original Siberian context. She again performs the striptease, discarding her muff and then the fur coat, while mustachioed Siberian men follow her every move, eventually fainting when she removes her coat to reveal a skimpy figure-hugging costume beneath. In Britain, the song was a hit for Pat Kirkwood who performed it in the 1938 revue Black Velvet. This led to her being dubbed \\"Britain's first wartime star\\". The song was thereafter associated with her. Marilyn Monroe sings the song in the film Let's Make Love (1960). The introduction is completely changed. She introduces herself as \\"Lolita\\", who is not allowed to \\"play with boys\\". A verse is added in which she invites a boy \\"to cook up a fine enchilada\\". The lines do not conform to the rhyme scheme of the rest of the song, but have been used by many other performers since. Anna Nicole Smith recorded a copy of the Monroe version in 1997, it was released in CD-single and 12 maxi with two versions. Lyrical and musical features Rhyming with \\"daddy\\" is difficult but Porter characteristically managed it well. One clever rhyme is Finnan haddie is smoked fish, and this is one of many innuendoes which appear throughout the song. Sophie Tucker famously advised Mary Martin to deliver such sexy lines while looking towards heaven. Mary Martin's stage persona was quite innocent and so the contrast between her naive manner and the suggestive lyrics accompanied by the provocative striptease made her performance a huge success. Brooks Atkinson, the critic of the New York Times, wrote that Martin's \\"mock innocence makes My Heart Belongs to Daddy the bawdy ballad of the season\\".Ronald L. Davis, Mary Martin, Broadway legend, University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, p.42. The original version contains four verses, all of which play on idiosyncratic rhymes with \\"daddy\\". The first refers to a game of golf during which she might \\"make a play for the caddy\\". The second is about the finnan haddie. The third tells of wearing green with a \\"Paddy\\" on St Patrick's day. The final verse is about a varsity football match where one might meet a \\"strong under-graddy\\". In the original version she ends up saying that her daddy might \\"spank\\" her if she was \\"bad\\". Referring to the melody, especially the passage of \\"da da da da\\"s, Oscar Levant described it as \\"one of the most Yiddish tunes ever written\\" despite the fact that \\"Cole Porter's background was not Jewish.\\"Oscar Levant, The Unimportance of Being Oscar, Pocket Books 1969 (reprint of G.P.

It carried lumber from the coasts of Northern California, Oregon, and Washington mainly to the port of San Francisco. The trade included direct foreign shipment from ports of the Pacific Northwest and might include another product characteristic of the region, salmon, as in the schooner Henry Wilson sailing from Washington state for Australia with \\"around 500,000 feet of lumber and canned salmon\\" in 1918. The trade was instrumental in founding shipping empires such as the Dollar Steamship Company in which its founder, Captain Robert Dollar, emigrated from Scotland, worked in the lumber camps of Canada and, after moving to San Francisco in 1888 and buying timber tracts, founded a shipping line that extended to China. Lumber schooners Lumber schooner C.A. Thayer Oregon Pine As late as the California Gold Rush, New England lumber was still carried 13,000 miles around Cape Horn to San Francisco. But that started to change when Captain Stephen Smith (of the bark George Henry) established one of the first west coast lumber mill in a redwood forest near Bodega, California, in 1843. The first lumber mill on the west coast was established by John B. R. Cooper in Rancho El Molino near present- day Forestville, California. By the mid-1880s, more than 400 such mills operated within the forests of California's Humboldt County and along the shores of Humboldt Bay alone. At first, the lumber was shipped in old square- riggers, but these aging ships were inefficient as they required a large crew to operate and were hard to load. Soon local shipyards opened to supply specialist vessels. In 1865 Hans Ditlev Bendixsen opened one of these yards at Fairhaven, California on Humboldt Bay adjacent to Eureka. Bendixsen built many vessels for the lumber trade, including the C.A. Thayer, now preserved at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. He constructed 92 sailing vessels between 1869 and 1901, including 35 three-masters. The lumber schooners were built of the same Douglas fir as the planks they carried. (Schooner Oregon Pine was named after the tree.) They had shallow drafts for crossing coastal bars, uncluttered deck arrangements for ease of loading, and were especially handy for maneuvering into the tiny, Northern California ports. Many West Coast lumber schooners were also rigged without topsails, a configuration referred to as being baldheaded. This rig simplified tacking into the strong westerlies when bound north. Crews liked baldheaders because no topmast meant no climbing aloft to shift or furl the sails. If more sail was desired then it could be set by being hoisted from the deck. The demands of navigating the Redwood Coast, however, and a boom in the lumber industry in the 1860s called for the development of handy two-masted schooners able to operate in the tiny dog-hole ports that served the sawmills. Many sites along this stretch of coast utilized chutes and wire trapeze rigging to load the small coastal schooners with lumber. Most of these ports were so small they were called dog-hole ports‚Äîsince they supposedly were just big enough to allow a dog to get in and out. Dozens of these were built, and almost any small cove or river outlet was a prime candidate for a chute.Revamped historic sailing schooner rechristened in S.F. (Carl Nolte, Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, April 12, 2007) Each dog-hole was unique, which was why schooner captains often sailed back and forth to the same ports to load. The mariners were often forced to load right among the rocks and cliffs in the treacherous surf.Dog Holes And Wire Chutes (in \\"Maritime Life and Traditions\\" by Jevne Haugan. Winter 2005. Number: 029. Page 24) The schooner rig dominated the lumber trade, since its fore-and-aft rigging permitted sailing closer to the wind, easier entry to small ports, and smaller crews than square-rigged vessels. These ships needed to return to the lumber ports without the expense of loading ballast. Shipyards built some smaller schooners with centerboards that retracted. This helped the flat-bottomed vessels to enter shallow water. At the time of the construction of the barque Hesperus in 1882, Jackson writes, \\"the form of the West Coast lumber vessels had become well established and were a radical departure from the New England built ships.\\" Because lumber is a bulk cargo that does not require shelter, and is difficult to stow below decks, lumber ships from yards such as the Hall Brothers in Port Blakely, Washington were built without the between decks of the New England \\"Downeasters.\\" \\"Close to half of their cargo was stowed as deckload ‚Äì that is above deck.\\" Jackson also writes that a triangle trade had developed at this time, with \\"lumber out to Australia, coal to Hawaii, and sugar to San Francisco. The return cargoes were compact and heavy, thus no need for the conventional deep hull form.\\". Recently, evidence of the local trade in Northern California was unearthed when a historic oven used in Fort Bragg from 1909 until 2003 was discovered to be built with \\"hundreds of century-old bricks, many stamped with the name of the California brick factory from which they had come: Richmond, Stockton and Corona.\\" Press coverage states that \\"these bricks had come north from San Francisco as ballast on lumber ships. In the years after the 1906 quake, Fort Bragg sent tons of timber to the city to be used in rebuilding. Coming home, the ships used bricks from Bay Area factories for weight and for new construction in Fort Bragg.\\" Eventually, however, steam-powered vessels proved more dependable than sail, and railroads gained greater penetration of the coastal regions. Sailing vessels continued to compete with steamships and railroads well into the 20th century, but the last purpose-built sailing lumber schooner was launched in 1905. Steam schooners Wapama Wapama in 2005 Esther Johnson, Australian waters as U.S. Army X-9 Wreck of a lumber schooner, San Francisco, CA Soon steam schooners (wooden but powered) replaced the small two-masters in the dog-hole trade and larger schooners, such as the still existing C.A. Thayer and the Wawona, were built for longer voyages and bigger cargo. West Coast shipyards continued to build sail-rigged lumber schooners until 1905 and wooden steam schooners until 1923. In 1907 observers noted the increase in size of schooners. The first three-masted schooner built on the Coast was launched in 1875. It was also the first lumber schooner to exceed 300 tons. Ship wrights built the first four- master in 1886 and the first five-master in 1896. The later were more generally involved in the overseas trade. Sail schooners grew from fifty to 1,100 tons during this period. More than 50 major shipbuilders operated on the Pacific Coast during the era of the coast wise schooners. Demand for coastwise lumber shipping continued until after the First World War and total lumber transported by the railroads did not exceed its seaborne competition until about 1905. Even in the 1870s mills shipped lumber directly from some dog- holes to Asia and South America. The last wooden steam lumber schooner built was constructed by Matthews Shipbuilding, Hoquiam, Washington in 1923 for the A. B. Johnson Lumber Company. Esther Johnson was of wooden construction with planking of three inch Douglas fir, long by and with draft. On 29 March 1943 the ship was purchased by the War Shipping Administration and by June had arrived in Australia to become part of the U.S. Army's Southwest Pacific Area fleet as X-9.* Esther Johnson arrived in Milne Bay on 4 October 1943 and, capable of transporting wooden piles sufficient to build an entire pier, was instrumental in building piers at the bases at Lae, Finschhafen in New Guinea and Tacloban in the Philippines. The ship was bombed on arrival at Lae and both bombed and strafed at Tacloban and at war's end was badly damaged by shipworms. The badly leaking ship returned from Manila to Melbourne for repairs and then returned to the Philippines going into the reserve fleet on 20 December 1947 at Subic Bay before being sold to the Philippine government on 23 February 1948. The older and slightly larger Barbara C, built as Pacific, also served in the Southwest Pacific in the same role.

Apart from being a memorial, it is usually intended as a reminder to passing motorists to share the road. Ghost bikes are usually junk bicycles painted white, sometimes with a placard attached, and locked to a suitable object close to the scene of the accident. They are also sometimes stripped of their tires, to deter theft.  History Ghost bike in Berlin, 2009: a fully functional bicycle painted white is now a common form of roadside memorial Ghost bike or \\"Bicianimita\\" in Chile, with a traditional small house for the soul of a road accident victim According to The Guardian, the first recorded ghost bike was in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2003. A witness to a collision between a cyclist and a car placed a painted bike at the location with a message that read: \\"Cyclist struck here. The original idea of painting bikes white reportedly goes back to the city of Amsterdam in the 1960s as an anarchist project to liberate two-wheel transport‚Äîwhite bikes were free, help yourself and then leave it for someone else. The ghost bike idea in the United States may have originated with a project by San Francisco artist Jo Slota, begun in April 2002. This was a purely artistic endeavor. Slota was intrigued by the abandoned bicycles that he found around the city, locked up but stripped of useful parts. He began painting them white, and posted photographs on his website, ghostbike.net. San Francisco is one of the safer U.S. cities for bicyclists, but memorial ghost bikes sprang up there as elsewhere, changing perceptions of his project. A ghost bike memorial project was started in St. Louis in October 2003.Fagan, Mark Friends seek ghost bike memorial for hit-and-run victim Lawrence Journal- World 25 October 2009 After observing a motorist strike a bicyclist in a bike lane on Holly Hills Boulevard, Patrick Van Der Tuin placed a white-painted bicycle on the spot with a hand-painted sign reading \\"Cyclist Struck Here\\".

A ghost bike in Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C., commemorating a rider killed by a garbage truck in 2008, remained for a full year. When it was removed by city employees, friends of the rider replaced it with 22 ghost bikes, one on every lamppost. London Ghostcycle was active in 2005 and 2006.

The station is situated on the Atlantic Coast Line, measured from . All services are operated by Great Western Railway, which also manages the station. History The first railway here was a horse-worked line from Newquay Harbour to Hendra Crazey. It was built by Joseph Treffry and completed in 1849. The Cornwall Minerals Railway opened its line from Fowey to St Dennis Junction on 1 June 1874, where it connected with Treffry's Newquay Railway. The trains continued to carry only goods traffic but a passenger service was introduced on 20 June 1876. The station was originally known as Halloon but was renamed \\"St Columb Road\\" on 1 November 1878. The passing loop was extended in 1933 to accommodate the long holiday trains that were then handled on the branch, but it was taken out of use on 3 January 1965 when the goods yard was closed. Services St Columb Road is a request stop on the line, so passengers wishing to alight must inform the conductor and passengers wishing to join the train must signal to the driver. The typical service is one train every two hours in each direction between Par and Newquay, with some services extending to Plymouth and one train in the summer extending to Penzance. On summer Saturdays, there is just one train per day in each direction due to the intercity services running through to Newquay in lieu of the local services. Trains are usually operated by Class 150 Sprinters. Community rail The trains between Par and Newquay are designated as a community rail service and is supported by marketing provided by the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership. The line is promoted under the \\"Atlantic Coast Line\\" name.

For our benefit, he has to give a copy of the film to the State Railway in return...\\", an excerpt from the writings of Prince Kampaengpet reads, in reaction to a visit by MacRae, who wanted to \\"take picture[s] of Bangkok and the Beauties of Siam, including the King and the Palace Buildings.\\" \\"I felt that His Majesty, King Rama VI, would be interested in moving pictures,\\" McRae wrote in The Film Year Book (1924). \\"And after considerable maneuvering I finally secured an audience which resulted in securing the entire [Royal Entertainment] Company's assistance together with the free use of the King's 52 automobiles, His Majesty's 600 race horses, the free use of the navy, the Royal Palaces, the railways, the rice mills, thousands of miles of rice fields, coconut groves, klongs and Elephants, and white elephants at that.\\" Ultimately, according to Thai film scholar Chalida Uabumrungjit, the Siamese government \\"allowed the making of this film in order to show the world the positive image of Siam at the time. Therefore, many incidents in the film featured the modern elements in Thai society such as travelling by express train or mail plane.\\" Controversy and disappearance When MacRae finished the film, he did give a copy to the Royal State Railway, per his agreement with Prince Kumbaengbejr. The railway agency had a public relations division that oversaw film production as a means to promote tourism in the kingdom (which is much the same way the modern-day Tourism Authority of Thailand operates in its promotional activities regarding film productions and the Bangkok International Film Festival). MacRae also turned over a copy to King Vajiravudh. It was shown in Bangkok for three days, but soon after it was lost. Film historians have searched, but the negatives of the film have not been found anywhere, nor is there evidence the film was even shown in the United States upon MacRae's return. One reason it may have been lost is due to a controversial scene in the film, in which MacRae filmed an execution of a prisoner, which led to criticism in the local media. \\"I would like to blame the local officer who did not save the honor of the country by forbidding them to do so. The execution will represent the barbarism of Siam,\\" a columnist said in the newspaper, Sambhand Thai. The movie was subject to censorship, and it is believed that the execution scenes were cut.Rithdee, Kong (March 24, 2006). \\"Historical inspiration\\", Bangkok Post Legacy While research and discussion about Miss Suwanna has long been the province of film historians and scholars, the subject of the film received mainstream attention as a major plot point in the 2006 Thai comedy, Nong Teng Nakleng-pukaotong (literally, Nong and Teng, the Golden Mount Gangsters). The story involves a likay performer (portrayed by Pongsak Pongsuwan) in 1923 Siam who finds his family's troupe being evicted from his theater to make way for a new phenomenon being brought to Siam by foreigners ‚Äì film. Together with his friend (Choosak Eamsuk), Nong seeks to disrupt the production of Miss Suwanna, which he sees as a corruptive influence on traditional culture. Alternate titles Despite the Royal Thai General System of Transcription for transliteration of Thai into English, the title of Miss Suwanna of Siam is stated many different ways. The title character's name has been alternately stated as Suwann, Suwan, Suwarn, Suvarn, Suwarna or Suvarna. The Thai title is Nang Sao Suwan, Nong Sao Suwan or Nangsao Suwan, with alternate English titles, The Gold of Siam or Kingdom of Heaven.

Clearwire traces its roots to 1998, when Sierra Technologies, Inc., spun off certain assets to form a new company, Clearwire Technologies Inc. In October 2003, Craig McCaw purchased Clearwire Technologies, Inc. parent company Clearwire Holdings and moved the company headquarters to Kirkland, Washington. In 2012, Clearwire moved the company headquarters to Bellevue, Washington. A large percentage of Clearwire shares were previously owned by a number of large companies including Sprint Nextel Corporation (now Sprint Corporation), Comcast Corporation, Time Warner Cable Inc., Bright House Networks, LLC, Google Inc. and Intel Corporation. Sprint Nextel was Clearwire's largest single shareholder, owning a 50.8% combined stake and control of the company. On July 9, 2013, Sprint Nextel completed acquiring the remaining shares it didn't already own, becoming sole owner of Clearwire Corporation. The day after, on July 10, 2013, Sprint Nextel and SoftBank Corp. announced the completion of their merger, where Softbank invested $21.6 billion in Sprint. Clearwire provided services to 88 markets in the United States covering 134 million potential subscribers. Sprint Corporation owns rights to radio frequency spectrum in the 2.5 GHz range which provides service primarily using the 4G 802.16e mobile WiMAX standard. Clearwire also provides service to customers in 17 U.S. cities using the Motorola Expedience 802.16d radio interface which the company refers to as \\"Pre-4G\\". Clearwire was ranked as the fifth largest wireless provider in the U.S., prior to being acquired, with roughly 11 million subscribers who used the WiMAX network as of January 2012. Sprint ceased operations of the Clearwire Network on November 6, 2015. History Clearwire traces its roots to 1998, when Sierra Technologies, Inc. spun off certain assets to form a new company, Clearwire, Inc., based in Arlington, Texas. Clearwire Technologies was formed by a number of investors including Sierra CEO Jim Gero and Edward \\"Rusty\\" Rose, a former co-managing partner of the Texas Rangers. Clearwire Technologies raised about US$100 million from Goldman Sachs, in conjunction with another client who held licenses for spectrum allocated to various educational institutions; the former Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) band now known as EBS or Educational Broadband Service. After Goldman provided the funds‚Äîwhich were supposed to be used to roll out the system in key markets across the U.S.‚Äîthey used a provision of the agreement to take control of the company; hiring a new CEO, Leo J. Cyr, who ousted the entire management team, including Clearwire CEO Brian Nerney, while diluting the strength of the founders still on the Board of Directors. A holding company controlled by Craig McCaw, Flux LLC, acquired Clearwire Inc's then parent company, Clearwire Holdings, in March 2004. After assuming control, McCaw installed executives from McCaw Cellular in the key leadership positions at Clearwire Corp. On June 3, 2004, McCaw purchased Clearwire Inc. for an undisclosed amount and used its name and resources, as well as technology developed by another McCaw-owned company, NextNet Wireless Inc., to launch his latest effort. On October 26, 2004, Intel Corp. teamed up with McCaw to develop and deploy a technology for portable wireless Internet access. The partnership included an investment by Clearwire Corp. On March 9, 2005, Bell Canada invested $100 million U.S. in Seattle- based Clearwire Corp. Clearwire grew from 1,000 customers in September 2004 to more than 443,000 customers by May 2008.Clearwire Reports First Quarter 2008 Results Clearwire claimed in September 2006 that 20% of its markets had more than 10% penetration of households covered. Clearwire took a $900 million infusion of capital from Intel and Motorola in July 2006, shortly after pulling its initial public offering. Clearwire's equipment manufacturer Nextnet Wireless was sold to Motorola as part of the exchange. This investment by these two industry giants had been reported as an attempt to accelerate the development and deployment of WiMAX networks worldwide. An unspecified source claims that AT&T; sold Clearwire a slice of 2.5 GHz spectrum for about $300 million. The spectrum covers markets in the southeast of the U.S. and was formerly owned by BellSouth. The spectrum solidifies Clearwire's position as the second largest holder of 2.5 GHz spectrum after Sprint Nextel. AT&T; had to sell the spectrum as a condition of its merger with BellSouth. Clearwire and Sprint Nextel announced a partnership in July 2007 to accelerate deployment of WiMAX technology across the US. The deal was to include a swap of spectrum and markets between the two companies, as well as providing roaming capabilities for customers traveling between the companies' networks. The partnership was terminated at the end of 2007. In 2008, Sprint's new CEO Dan Hesse started serious discussions about forming a joint venture between the two companies in the hopes of bringing in outside funding from Google, Intel, and Best Buy. On March 26, 2008 an anonymous source stated that Sprint and Clearwire may get as much as $1 billion from Comcast and $500 million from Time Warner Cable in financial backing. Clearwire filed for its initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2006. The company's underwriters included Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase. Trading began March 8, 2007 under the ticker symbol \\"CLWR\\" on the Nasdaq. Clearwire offered 24 million shares at $25 a share, and raised approximately US$600 million. Before the Sprint merger, Craig McCaw was the largest shareholder of the company with a majority of the shares. On May 7, 2008, Clearwire and Sprint Nextel's wireless broadband unit Xohm announced their intent to merge, combining Sprint's 4G WiMAX network (Xohm) with Clearwire's existing pre-WiMAX broadband network. Sprint owns 54% of the firm, with ex-Clearwire shareholders owning 27% ‚Äì a consortium of Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Intel, Google, and Bright House Networks invested $3.2 billion and owns the balance. Clearwire and the cable companies will buy 3G mobile broadband from Sprint as MVNOs. Clearwire/Sprint Nextel officially launched Portland, Oregon, as the first market using the new service. Clearwire's 4G service was branded as CLEAR, except in those markets where the Clearwire name has already been established and where CLEAR service is not available. CLEAR 4G was available in 35 of the country's 40 largest metropolitan statistical areas, covering 130 million people. On March 9, 2009, Clearwire named Bill Morrow as CEO, succeeding Benjamin Wolff, who became co-chairman with Craig McCaw. Morrow, 49, stepped down as CEO of Pacific Gas & Electric Company. Morrow had previously held a number of senior positions at Vodafone. In April 2009, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Clearwire. The suit was dismissed in April 2009 but was appealed by the complainant. The suit claimed that the company's actual Internet connection speeds were slower than advertised and was sometimes unavailable. On December 31, 2010, McCaw resigned as chairman of Clearwire and was replaced by John W. Stanton.Clearwire Announces Election of John W. Stanton as Chairman of Company Board of Directors On March 10, 2011, Bill Morrow resigned as CEO and was replaced by interim CEO John W. Stanton.Clearwire Names Chairman John W. Stanton as Interim CEO On August 10, 2011, Clearwire promoted COO Erik Prusch to president and CEO, and named John Stanton executive chairman.Press Release Clearwire stated that it might not honor a $237 million debt covenant due on December 1, 2011, in order to conserve cash. However, on December 2, 2011, the company announced that not only had it made that payment, but it had made a new four-year deal with Sprint to receive funding for network buildout and investments valued at $1.6 billion. Complete acquisition by Sprint Nextel On October 14, 2012, it was announced that Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank would purchase 70% of Sprint Nextel Corporation for $20.1 billion. This initially led to speculation that Sprint would buy out Clearwire, but \\"two well placed sources\\" within Sprint said that such a maneuver would not occur. Sprint, however, announced on October 18, 2012, that it acquired a majority interest in Clearwire by buying a stake from Clearwire's founder, which gave Sprint a 50.8% ownership and control of Clearwire. On December 17, 2012, Sprint announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining stake in Clearwire that it did not then own for $2.97 per share, which equaled $2.2 billion. Over a period of approximately six months, a bidding war with DISH Network for Clearwire occurred, ultimately resulting in Sprint increasing its offer price for Clearwire to $5 per share. On July 8, 2013, Clearwire announced that its stockholders approved the merger with Sprint. Relatedly, Sprint's stockholders approved the merger with SoftBank, which closed on July 10, 2013. Subsequently, it planned to lay off about 75% of its employees.Amy Martinez, \\"Sprint to lay off 91 in Bellevue, Kirkland\\" CLEAR announced that it would shut down on November 5, 2015. On November 6, 2015, CLEAR service was terminated. The WiMAX network was operated, without CLEAR customers, until early March 2016 because of a court order. Networks Expedience OFDM ‚Äì Pre-4G In 17 markets in the United States and certain markets in Belgium, Clearwire provides a service it refers to as \\"Pre-4G\\" using a Point-to- Multipoint system from Motorola called \\"Expedience\\", part of the MOTOwi4 family of products. The service is considered true Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS). The service is not unique to Clearwire. Several companies throughout the world use this same product line from Motorola, including Inukshuk Wireless Partnership of Canada, Beamspeed and Commspeed of Arizona, AccessTEL of Bangladesh, and Unitel of Guatemala. WiMAX 802.16e - 4G Branded CLEAR, the company, on January 6, 2009, unveiled Portland, Oregon, as its first 4G WiMAX wireless broadband market, enabling consumers and businesses to access the Internet, wirelessly, at broadband speeds.

On June 4, 2010, Sprint Nextel introduced the first commercially available 4G cellphone in the U.S., the HTC EVO 4G. The device combines Clearwire's 4G network with Sprint's 3G network and Google's Android operating system, creating a multimedia-heavy device Sprint hoped would set it apart from 3G smartphones like the Apple iPhone. Criticism In 2005, Clearwire drew criticism from phone operator Vonage. Vonage claimed Clearwire and other ISPs were blocking Vonage's services. Testing showed that contrary to Vonage's claims, Vonage calls were being connected over the Clearwire network. In September 2010, Clearwire introduced a dynamic network management system, which, for users who consume \\"disproportionate\\" amounts of wireless data, limited the user to about 256 kbit/s of network throughput. Certain users claimed their terms of service were modified retroactively to reflect the new policy, and Clearwire itself has unofficially acknowledged this claim. In the middle of 2012, Clearwire reached a settlement to provide partial refunds of termination fees and service credits for individuals who experienced throttling as part of their dynamic network management policy. The settlement allows Clearwire to continue throttling connections under certain circumstances as long as their advertising reflects this.\\"Dennings v.

Edwardes started out in theatre management, soon working at a number of West End theatres. By the age of 20, he was managing theatres for Richard D'Oyly Carte. In 1885, Edwardes became a manager at the Gaiety Theatre with John Hollingshead, who soon retired. For the next three decades, Edwardes ruled a theatrical empire including the Gaiety, Daly's Theatre, the Adelphi Theatre and others, and sent touring companies around Britain and abroad. In the early 1890s, Edwardes recognised the changing tastes of musical theatre audiences and led the movement away from burlesque and comic opera to Edwardian musical comedy. Life and career Edwardes was born at Great Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England. He was the eldest of four sons and three daughters of James Edwards, comptroller of customs, and his wife, Eleanor Widdup. Edwardes' parents were Roman Catholics from Wexford, Ireland. He attended St James's College, in Clee, after which he was sent to London to take the examination for the Royal Military Academy. However, his cousins were Irish theatre managers John and Michael Gunn, and they obtained a job for him at Leicester's Royal Opera House.G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"Edwardes, George Joseph (1855‚Äì1915)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 18 September 2008, Early career Michael Gunn met Richard D'Oyly Carte in 1875 and later became a partner in his production company.Ainger, p. 111 He and young Edwardes moved to London to work for Carte at the Opera Comique in the late 1870s, with Edwardes being given the trusted position of treasurer. He eventually became Carte's manager at the Opera Comique and then was Carte's first managing director of the Savoy Theatre in 1881, helping to produce several of the famous Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas until 1885. During this time, he added the \\"e\\" to his surname. While working at the Opera Comique, Edwardes met his future wife, singer Julia Gwynne, whom he brought to the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, where she became a principal player. The couple married in 1885 and produced three daughters, including one named Dorothy, and a son, D'Arcy. Souvenir programme from Ruy Blas and the Blas√© Rou√© In 1885, Edwardes was hired to succeed John Hollingshead as manager at the Gaiety Theatre, producing the burlesques in which the Gaiety specialised. Together, they produced Little Jack Sheppard a burlesque in a full-length format with an original score by Meyer Lutz, which opened at Christmas 1885. After this, in 1886, Hollingshead retired, and from then on the Guv'nor (as Edwardes came to be known) was in charge, with the assistance of the theatre's star player, Nellie Farren. The next show that Edwardes produced at the Gaiety was Dorothy (1886), a comic opera similar to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that he had produced for Carte, but the Gaiety's audiences were used to burlesques, and so Edwardes sold the rights to Dorothy, which became a hit at another theatre. Following on the success of Little Jack Sheppard, Edwardes turned the Gaiety back to producing burlesques, but these were \\"new burlesques\\": full-length pieces with original music by Meyer Lutz, instead of scores compiled from popular tunes.\\"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies\\", The Times, 20 February 1914, p. 9, col. D These included Monte Cristo, Junior (1887), Miss Esmeralda (1887), Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim (1887), Faust up to Date (1888), Ruy Blas and the Blas√© Rou√© (1889), Carmen up to Data (1890),Programme for Carmen up to Data Cinder Ellen up too Late (1891), and Don Juan (1892, with music by Meyer Lutz, book by Fred Leslie and lyrics by Adrian Ross). John D'Auban choreographed the Gaiety burlesques until 1891.\\"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps\\". The Times, 17 April 1922, p. 17Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, The Theatre Museum, London (2009) These new burlesques were very successful and toured widely in Britain and abroad.NY Times article that describes the U.S. performances However, Dorothy's runaway success (it became the longest-running piece in musical theatre history up to that time) showed Edwardes and other producers that topical, light comedies could be enormously successful. At the same time, the death of Fred Leslie and retirement of Nellie Farren by 1892 helped bring to an end the era of Gaiety burlesque. Edwardes produced shows at other theatres as well. For instance, in 1892, he took over the Prince of Wales Theatre.The Times obituary, 5 October 1915, p. 11 In addition, after Gilbert and Sullivan stopped working together exclusively in the 1890s, Edwardes produced Gilbert's His Excellency at the Lyric Theatre in 1894. He also became manager of the struggling Empire Theatre, London, and transformed it into a music hall before it became associated with several successful ballets under the composer- director Leopold Wenzel.Richards, Jeffrey. Imperialism and Music: Britain 1876‚Äì1953, pp. 257‚Äì60 (2002) Manchester University Press Popularising musical comedy Poster for A Gaiety Girl In the 1890s, Edwardes hit upon a new strategy for the Gaiety, which was a variation from the kinds of shows that he and Carte had produced and also had elements of the Gaiety burlesques and of music hall entertainments. The earliest of these shows, taking a cue from Dorothy, had a musical style similar to the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas. Into this mix, he incorporated some of the elements of the form that Harrigan & Hart had established on Broadway a decade earlier.Kenrick, John. A History of The Musical ‚Äì After G & S; The Gaiety Musicals, The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film (2003) Like Thomas German Reed and W. S. Gilbert before him, Edwardes wanted to produce musical plays that were more respectable (and would attract a more affluent, polite crowd) than risqu√© burlesque. But Edwardes sought pieces that integrated spoken dialogue and music in a lighter, less satiric way than Gilbert and Sullivan had, using topical songs, fashionable costumes and sassy byplay between the characters.Traubner, Richard. Operetta: A Theatrical History, pp. 198‚Äì219, Routledge, 2003 The first of these, In Town in 1892 and A Gaiety Girl in 1893 (both of which were produced by Edwardes at the Prince of Wales Theatre), met with strong success and confirmed Edwardes on the path he was taking.\\"Gaiety Theatre\\" , ArthurLloyd theatre site Edwardes dubbed his new musical plays \\"musical comedies\\". If Edwardes didn't invent the genre, he popularised it in Britain and was the first producer to elevate them to international popularity.\\"Musical Comedy\\" , Musicals Tour at PeoplePlayUK theatre site He used the best writers and composers to create entertainments appealing to his Victorian and Edwardian audiences. Although he never acted in his productions, Edwardes controlled every other aspect of them. The Gaiety Theatre Souvenir ‚Äì 1st anniversary performance of The Shop Girl At the Gaiety Theatre, Edwardes hired Ivan Caryll as the resident composer and music director, and created a series of shows featuring fashionable characters and costumes, tuneful music, romantic and topical lyrics and pretty dancing. He embedded these elements in an often tenuous but nonetheless continuous original narrative. Like burlesque, Edwardes' \\"girl\\" musicals featured chorus lines and other devices for the display of women's bodies, but within the context of the simple narrative, elaborate displays of contemporary fashion and scenery, and light parody of social convention and topical issues. For the next two decades, the \\"girl\\" musicals, with popular songs by Lionel Monckton and lively books by Owen Hall, filled the Gaiety Theatre, including The Shop Girl (1894), The Circus Girl (1896), A Runaway Girl (1898), The Orchid (1903), The Spring Chicken (1905), The Girls of Gottenberg (1907), Our Miss Gibbs (1909), The Sunshine Girl (1912), and After the Girl (1914). The heroines were independent young women who often earned their own livings. The stories followed a familiar plot line ‚Äì a chorus girl breaks into high society, a shop girl makes a good marriage. There was always a misunderstanding during act one and an engagement at the end.Coward, Noel. Foreword to Musical Comedy by Raymond Mander and Joe Mitchenson (New York: Taplinger Publishing, 1969), pp. 7‚Äì8 In the words of a contemporary review, Edwardes‚Äô musicals were \\"Light, Bright and enjoyable.\\" These musicals were widely imitated by other British producers, and, within a decade, in America. Perhaps to balance the \\"girl\\" musicals, the Gaiety also presented a series of what could be described as \\"boy\\" musicals, such as The Messenger Boy (1900), The Toreador (1901), The New Aladdin (1906), and Theodore and Co. (1916) The Gaiety Girls and high fashion Gaiety Girls, c. 1890 A major attraction of Edwardes' shows was his glamorous, dancing corps of \\"Gaiety Girls\\". These were fashionable, elegant young ladies, unlike the corseted actresses from the earlier burlesques.Description of the Gaiety Girls In Edwardes' shows, these ladies were, as The Sketch noted in its review of The Geisha in 1896, \\"clothed in accordance with the very latest and most extreme modes of the moment.\\" Many of the best-known London couturiers designed costumes for Edwardes' productions. The illustrated periodicals were eager to publish photographs of actresses in the latest stage hits, and so the theatre became an excellent way for clothiers to publicise their latest fashions.Information about the famous costume designs of the musicals Gaiety girls were polite, well-behaved young women and became a popular attraction and a symbol of ideal womanhood. They were much sought after by the \\"stage door johnnies\\" of the 1890s‚Äîsome of them becoming popular actresses or marrying into society and even the nobility.Gillan, Don. \\"Actresses and the Peerage\\", Stage Beauty website (2007) For example, in 1907, Denise Orme married Lord Churston and she later married the Duke of Leinster. Alan Hyman wrote in The Gaiety Years, :At the old Gaiety in the Strand the chorus was becoming a matrimonial agency for girls with ambitions to marry into the peerage and began in the nineties when Connie Gilchrist, a star of the Old Gaiety, married the Earl of Orkney and then in 1901, the Marquess of Headfort married Rosie Boote, who had charmed London the previous year when she sang Maisie in The Messenger Boy. After Connie Gilchrist and Rosie Boote had started the fashion a score of the Guv'nor's budding stars left him to marry peers or men of title while other Gaiety Girls settled for a banker or a stockbroker. The Guv'nor finding this was playing ducks and drakes with his theatrical plans had a 'nuptial clause' inserted in every contract... Debutantes were competing with the other girls to get into the Gaiety chorus while upper-class youths were joining the ranks of the chorus boys. Other theatres and later years Cover of the Vocal Score Edwardes joined with American producer Augustin Daly to build a new London theatre that they would share. Daly's Theatre opened in 1893, but Daly did not produce many works. In 1895, Edwardes took over the management of the theatre, where Sidney Jones was hired as the resident composer and music director. Edwardes' shows at Daly's had more coherent plots and more romantic music specifically composed for the plot of the piece, rather than a collection of topical popular songs. They were more like what musical comedy was to become at maturity than their Gaiety Theatre siblings, the more review-like \\"Girl\\" musicals. These shows included hits like An Artist's Model (1895), The Geisha (1896), A Greek Slave (1898), and San Toy (1899). The stars at Daly's included strong, romantic singers: baritone Hayden Coffin and soprano Marie Tempest. They were joined by soubrette dancer Letty Lind and comic Huntley Wright. After a falling out with Coffin, Edwardes found success at Daly's with a series of English-language adaptations of European operettas, including Les p'tites Michu (1905), The Merry Widow (1907), The Dollar Princess (1910), The Count of Luxemburg (1911) and The Marriage Market (1913). He produced The Girl in the Train at the Vaudeville Theatre in 1909. Edwardes in 1903 Edwardes also used the Apollo Theatre for several musicals, including Three Little Maids (1902) and The Girl from Kays (1902). As Edwardes' success grew, he needed another theatre and added the Adelphi Theatre to his chain of musical houses. There he produced a series of musicals by Lionel Monckton, Percy Greenbank and Adrian Ross, including The Earl and the Girl (1903), The Quaker Girl (1910), The Dancing Mistress (1912), and The Girl from Utah (1913). At the Lyric Theatre, in 1903, he produced Caryll's comic opera The Duchess of Dantzic. He also managed the Empire Theatre of Varieties, among other theatres. Edwardes was a founder member of the Society of West End Theatre Managers, along with Frank Curzon, Helen Carte, Arthur Bourchier and sixteen others.\\"The Society of West-End Theatre Managers\\", The Times, 24 April 1908, p. 17. Edwardes raced horses, and one of this thoroughbreds, Santoi, won many prizes.Barrington, p. 241 He also bred horses in County Tipperary. When World War I broke out, Edwardes was making his annual visit to a German spa. He was imprisoned in Germany for several months, which exacerbated his health problems. Death Edwardes died at his home in Regent's Park, London, just before his 60th birthday. He was buried at St Mary's Cemetery, Kensal Green, and was survived by his wife, Julia Gwynne. Although Edwardes left valuable properties, he also left considerable debts. His theatrical enterprises continued to operate under the guidance of Robert Evett, who managed to produce a number of hits over the next few years, notably The Maid of the Mountains and The Boy, both beginning in 1917, that paid the debts of the estate.Lamb, Andrew.

The first part of this line, which ran from a junction to the west of (at a point which became known as ) to , opened on 1 October 1850, and this included a station at Bicester.

He is particularly known for his series of record-breaking trans-oceanic hot air balloon flights and, later, attempts to be the first to fly a Rozi√®re balloon around the Earth ‚Äì all with British entrepreneur, Sir Richard Branson.Per Lindstrand. (2010). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved May 13, 2010, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online He is also the founder of eponymous Lindstrand Balloons hot air balloon manufacturer based in Oswestry, England. Lindstrand not only flies balloons, but many other aircraft as well, and holds an airline transport pilot's licence for single and multi-engined land and sea aeroplanes and helicopters, and a commercial pilot's licence for autogyros, airships and gliders. His long standing dream to make a flight around the world in a hot air balloon (as opposed to a Rozi√®re or gas balloon which requires no constant source of heated air) still remains unrealized. His distance, duration and altitude records have made him one of the best known balloonists and aerostat designers and engineers in the world. Early life Lindstrand's aeronautical career began in the Swedish Air Force where he was an Engineering Officer. His first balloon flight in the early 1970s was the result of a bet. He built a makeshift balloon and successfully flew it across the runway while in the Swedish Air Force to claim victory. (When he flew more conventional military aircraft, he chose to use call sign, Polar Per.) Lindstrand later gained a masters degree in aeronautical engineering and worked for Saab Aircraft in Sweden and Lockheed in the United States. He saw his second hot air balloon in 1975 when a neighbour in Sweden purchased it from a British company. When Lindstrand learned that this new balloon was supposed to be state-of-the-art, he decided that he could do better. Company history With Swedish aircraft engineer and entrepreneur, H√•kan Colting, he formed Colting Balloons which operated in Ireland from 1976. In 1978 the company moved to Oswestry, England, to be closer to major markets in the UK and Europe. When H√•kan Colting moved to Canada, Lindstrand continued to run the renamed Colt Balloons (later Thunder & Colt Balloons after acquiring UK-based Thunder Balloons). In December 1991 Lindstrand founded Lindstrand Balloons Ltd.Lindstrand Technologies: Per Lindstrand , accessed 2010-05-13 and later created a specialized aerospace company, Lindstrand Technologies Ltd. (both based in Oswestry) to manufacture and repair aerostats, airships, gas balloons, passenger-carrying tethered aerostats and other fabric engineering products (including architectural structures, innovative fire-safety devices for road tunnels and inflatable flood defence barriers). In 2002, Lindstrand Balloons was asked to manufacture the complex parachute for the Mars-lander, Beagle 2. Beagle 2 was launched in June 2003 but unfortunately failed to land successfully on the Planet Mars on Christmas Day 2003. Lindstrand Balloons, in partnership with Daimler Chrysler Aerospace of Germany, was awarded a design contract by the European Space Agency to develop a high altitude long endurance airship for possible use in the telecommunications market. Resulting from this, Lindstrand was awarded the German-based Korber Prize for engineering excellence. Record flights A 1998 attempt at an around-the-world balloon flight by Branson, Fossett, and Lindstrand ends in the Pacific Ocean on 25 December 1998. From early in his business career, Lindstrand's main interest and ambition lay in pushing the boundaries of lighter-than-air technology and he subsequently captured every absolute world record for hot air balloon flight. Ascending from Plano, Texas, on 6 June 1988, Lindstrand set a new world altitude record for hot-air balloons, reaching 19,811 meters (64,997 feet). The record stood until 26 November 2005, when Vijaypat Singhania exceeded it.Anonymous, \\"Indian sets balloon flight record,\\" bbc.com, 26 November 2005, 12:11 GMT.balloonboise.com Ballooning History In January 1991, in the Virgin Pacific Flyer (a hot air balloon measuring 74,000 m¬≥ (2,600,300 ft¬≥), designed and built by Thunder & Colt), Lindstrand and Branson completed the longest flight in lighter-than-air history when they flew 6761 miles from Japan to Northern Canada. Their flight set two new world records for distance and duration and they broke their own ground speed record, recording 245 mph (395 km/h). The Virgin Pacific Flyer still remains the largest hot air balloon ever built. In an attempt to be the first to fly a balloon of any type around the world, in December 1998, Lindstrand, partnered by Richard Branson and Steve Fossett, flew for 7 days and covered over 20,000 km in a Rozi√®re balloon, launching from Morocco and landing in the Pacific Ocean near to rescue services in Hawaii. Rather less successful was his attempt in 1983 to achieve the world altitude record for hot-air balloons. Sponsored by the English and Welsh Milk Industry, a vast balloon emblazoned with \\"Milk's Gotta Lotta Bottle\\" was prepared for launch to be broadcast on live television early one Saturday morning. Adverse weather conditions led to the mission being aborted, but the balloon filled with air whilst being towed along the ground. Lindstrand was holding one of the ropes, and was lifted 30 feet into the air. On letting go, he fell to the ground, sustaining a dislocated shoulder. The accident, including the fall, was seen and heard on the television broadcast. Recognition Lindstrand received the Royal Aero Club's Gold Medal from Prince Andrew twice, in 1989 and 1991, and the Royal Aero Club's Britannia Trophy in 1988. He is a recipient of America's highest flying award, the Harmon Trophy, given to him by Vice President Quayle in the White House. In February 2006, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the Royal Institute of British Architects for \\"his highly innovative work in the field of inflatables and their application to habitable structures\\". Lindstrand is also in the Guinness Hall of Fame. References External links * Lindstrand Technologies Ltd. (UK company) * Lindstrand Balloons Ltd.

It is measured from , on the Atlantic Coast Line. The station is managed by Great Western Railway with local services in each direction all calling here. There are few local services on summer Saturdays, when intercity trains run through to Newquay. However, all intercity trains operated by Great Western Railway and CrossCountry pause at this station when travelling in the up direction towards Par so that the level crossing can be activated. However, such stops are not available to passengers. History The first railway here was a horse-worked line from Newquay Harbour to Hendra Crazey. It was built by Joseph Treffry and completed in 1849. The Cornwall Minerals Railway opened its line from Fowey to St Dennis Junction on 1 June 1874, where it connected with Treffry's Newquay Railway. Although a siding was provided at an early date and passenger trains began passing through from 20 June 1876, the station at Quintrell Downs was not opened until 2 October 1911 (as Quintrell Downs Platform), by which time the line was part of the Great Western Railway. The suffix 'platform' in a GWR station name meant a staffed halt, and a member of staff remained until the gated level crossing was replaced by an open crossing in the 1990s. This crossing was upgraded to automatic half barriers in 2003-04.  Services  Class 150 with a service to Par Quintrell Downs is the only intermediate station on the line to not be a request stop. The typical service is one train every two hours in each direction between Par and Newquay, with some services extending to Plymouth and one train in the summer extending to Penzance. On summer Saturdays, there is just one train per day in each direction due to the intercity services running through to Newquay in lieu of the local services. Trains are usually operated by Class 150 Sprinters. Community rail Local trains on the Newquay branch are designated as community rail services and are supported with marketing jointly provided by the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership and the franchised operator.

It is the fourth entry in the Point Blank series, comprising both new stages and ones taken from the first three games. Players use the touch screen to complete a number of different minigames that vary in terms of mechanics, such as protecting an on-screen character or shooting down a specific target. Development and release Point Blank DS was produced by Nobutaka Nakajima, known for working on projects relating to older Namco video games, including Namco Museum Battle Collection and Pac 'N Roll, alongside the Xbox Live Arcade digital versions of Pac-Man, Galaga and Dig Dug. Development took around ten months to complete, featuring a team of 25 people. Nakajima was interested in the Nintendo DS' hardware capabilities and touch screen controls, thinking that the Point Blank series could be adapted for play on the handheld. Converting the series' gameplay to the DS proved to be an issue from the start, however the team overcame it later on. Nakajima noted that should the game sell well, similar \\"touch shooting\\" video games could be produced for the DS. In Japan, the game was part of Namco Bandai's Un≈ç no Tatsujin series, which featured quick thinking-based puzzles with cameos by other Namco game characters. Point Blank DS was released in Japan on May 18, 2006, followed by a North American and European release on June 13. Reception Point Blank DS received mixed reviews from critics, with common complaints being towards the game's lack of replay value and for minigames being too similar to each other. It holds a 66/100 on aggregator website Metacritic. GamePro expressed disappointment towards the game's lack of depth, saying how it only provides a few hours of play even with the amount of content. A similar response was echoed by GamesRadar+, who also criticized the long loading times present in the multiplayer mode. IGN thought the game was shallow in some areas, notably with its low amount of content, and disliked the multiplayer mode's long loading times, while GameSpot criticized many of the minigames for being too similar to each other and for the game not having enough variety. GameSpot also labeled the redemption game remakes as \\"incredibly dull\\" and disliked its lack of unlockable extras.

The additional characters Edna and Claypone are mentioned by Lawrence and Joanna, but have no lines and are not mentioned in the Dramatis personae or the stage directions. This implies that they are fictional characters in the minds of Lawrence and Joanna. Lawrence and Joanna are brother and sister. However, the play strongly implies that they are having an incestuous relationship, which has resulted in Joanna's pregnancy. Lawrence (and, to a lesser degree, Joanna) is characterized by extreme agoraphobia. He is suspicious of everything that Joanna tells him about the outside world. At the end of the play, Lawrence refuses to go out, even to save Joanna's life. Lawrence believes totally in Edna and Claypone's existence, and Joanna mostly seems to share this belief. However, when Lawrence sends Edna to fetch the doctor, Joanna screams, \\"No, Lawrence, you go! You go!!!'

Joanna enters in a panic, having been seen by some frightening entity called either Pruneface or Wienerface, or both. She is pregnant. They engage in a number of strange, playful, seemingly random conversations. Joanna tells Lawrence about an encounter she had on the subway with a college-aged boy, and Lawrence accuses her of having sex with him. They play games, including one where Joanna is a queen and Lawrence commands Edna and Claypone to fetch her various things. All of a sudden, however, he halts the game with the line: \\"You're not a queen, you're a whore.\\" Eventually Joanna collapses, seemingly unable to walk. She screams at Lawrence to get a doctor, but he is afraid of the outside world and refuses to go outside, preferring to send Edna instead. Joanna's pains, possibly the result of pre-eclampsia, persis. She eventually falls, unmoving, onto the bed. Lawrence leans over her and begs her to return, falling into a stutter as the play ends.

On September 10, 1996, Gonzalez announced that he had remembered the details of giving the information to Boyle, Assistant Deputy Minister Robert Fowler and Dr. Ken Calder - although there were questions about his credibility.

Interviewed by CTV, Defence Minister David Collenette sought to correct those who suggested that he was strongly supporting Boyle. This gave commentators the view that he was distancing himself, to avoid being caught in the undertow of the scandal and survive with his political office intact. As Commissioner Peter Desbarats later summarised, it indicated \\"he perhaps has already decided to sacrifice Boyle in order to protect himself\\".

It is the terminus of the Atlantic Coast Line from Par, measured from . The station is situated in the heart of Newquay, close to the town centre itself and the beaches. The station is managed by Great Western Railway which operates local branch line services to and from Par. In the summer, there also services to and from London with the addition of long- distance CrossCountry services on weekends. History The first railway at Newquay was a horse-worked line from the harbour to Hendra Crazey. It was built by Joseph Treffry in stages between 1846 and 1849. The line was extended on 1 June 1874 by the Cornwall Minerals Railway, goods trains now reaching Fowey. A branch line from Tolcarn Junction, just outside Newquay, ran to Gravel Hill Mine near Treamble where there was an iron mine. Passenger trains were introduced on 20 June 1876. The Great Western Railway operated all the trains from 1 October 1877 and bought out the Cornwall Minerals Railway on 1 July 1896. The original station had just a single platform and a turntable at the end of the platform was used to release locomotives from incoming trains. The station was rebuilt in 1905 with two platforms serving three tracks. A new line was opened from Shepherds, on the Treamble branch, to Perranporth on 2 January 1905, which allowed a new service to run from Newquay to Truro. The following year through carriages started to be run from London using the direct line from Par. The main departure platform was lengthened in 1928 and again in 1935; the second platform was lengthened in 1938. These enlargements were to accommodate the longer trains that were now bringing holidaymakers from London and elsewhere. Extensive carriage sidings were laid on the south side of the station to store these trains between services. The station started to be run down following the closure of the line to Truro on 4 February 1963. The goods yard was closed in 1965; the roof on platforms 2 and 3 was removed in 1964. Platform 3 was shortened in 1966 and its locomotive release line taken out of use on 4 October 1972, by which time four of the carriage sidings had been removed. On 5 October 1987 the signal box was closed, all the remaining signals were dismantled and the rails serving platform 1 were lifted. At the same time the last of the carriage sidings were closed and lifted. The track beside the former platform 3 was kept as a siding until the mid-1990s. The remaining platform has been resurfaced for its entire length in early 2012, and the former station canopies have been replaced by a new by wave-shaped canopy above the concourse. Newquay Harbour The rail network at the harbour The original terminus of the Newquay Railway was at the harbour. Horses hauled wagons along a line that wound between houses to reach the top of a 1 in 4¬Ω incline that carried the line down to the harbour. Wagons were lowered on a cable down the incline, which was in a tunnel dug out of the cliff. At the foot the track ran onto the eastern breakwater but a shunt-back and wooden trestle bridge gave access to the stone jetty in the middle of the harbour. After steam locomotives were introduced by the Cornwall Minerals Railway in 1874, wagons continued to be moved between Newquay railway station and the harbour incline by horses. Traffic handled at the harbour gradually declined and the line was closed in 1925 and lifted in 1926. Part of the route is now a footpath from opposite the station to the cliff tops above the beach. Trenance Viaduct Trenance Viaduct Between Newquay station and Tolcarn Junction the line crosses the Trenance valley on a 154-yard (141m) viaduct. The first structure, opened on 29 January 1849, was a timber structure on stone piers. It was much lighter than the similarly-constructed Cornwall Railway viaducts that were built a few years later, and very different from the imposing granite Treffry Viaduct built by Treffry for his Par tramway. The piers were raised and new wrought iron girders installed ready for the opening of the line for locomotives in 1874. This was replaced by the present masonry structure on 27 March 1939. It carried two tracks from 20 March 1946; the line to Tolcarn Junction was singled on 23 November 1964 but the second line was retained for shunting purposes until the rationalisation in the 1980s. Services Class 150 with a morning service to Par Newquay is the terminus of the branch line from Par. The service is irregular with typically one train around every two hours. As well as the local service, it handles a number of long-distance trains in the summer. These services include Great Western Railway trains from London Paddington and CrossCountry trains from the North of England and the Scottish Lowlands, which do not stop at intermediate stations between Par and Newquay. On Sundays, there are some local trains and a small number of intercity services. As well as the weekend through trains, in peak summer months there is also a Monday-Friday through Great Western Railway intercity service to and from London, but local trains continue on these days too. Traditionally, there was no Sunday service in the winter, even in the 'golden age' between both of the 20th century's world wars, but the line has a service of three trains each way on Sundays from 11 December 2011. The station has a staffed ticket office which is open from mid May until early September, however it does not have a ticket vending machine so when the ticket office is closed (outside of summer), passengers will have to purchase their tickets on-board the train. Seating is available under the station canopy and on the platform, also in the platform shelter. Refreshments are available on the station concourse. Community rail The local trains between Par and Newquay are designated as a community rail service, supported by marketing from the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership. The route is promoted as the \\"Atlantic Coast Line\\". The other Cornish branch lines are full Community Railways, but only the local service to Newquay is designated in this way, because the presence of intercity and clay trains makes it impossible to designate the line itself. Three pubs in Newquay take part in the Atlantic Coast Line rail ale trail.

Biography Wexler attended Harvard University, and in 1939 he was awarded a Ph.D. in meteorology under Carl- Gustaf Rossby from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He worked for the United States Weather Bureau from 1934 until 1942, then served as a Captain to a Lieutenant Colonel with the weather service of the Army Air Corps during World War II from 1942 until 1946. On September 14, 1944, Major Harry Wexler became the first scientist to deliberately fly into a hurricane. He accompanied a flight of a Douglas A-20 \\"Havoc\\" that flew into the hurricane to collect scientific data. In 1946 he returned to the U.S. Weather Bureau, becoming Chief of the Scientific Services division. As head researcher, Wexler encouraged a study into the atmospheres of planets other than the Earth. He is particularly noted for his work on the use of satellites for meteorological purposes, the development of the TIROS-1‚Äîthe world's first weather satellite. Science fiction author and futurist, Arthur C. Clarke, had been following Wexler's work on hurricanes in the 40s and wrote to Wexler to ask for his thoughts on Clarke's idea of using an artificial satellite to study weather patterns from space. This put Wexler on a path that would eventually lead to the launch of TIROS-1 in 1960. He also studied the use of computers for weather prediction and modification. He was instrumental in finding funds and support for the measurement and study of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere initiated by Roger Revelle and Charles David Keeling, key work for drawing attention to the problem of global warming. He was chief scientist for a U.S. expedition to the Antarctic for the International Geophysical Year in 1958. In 1958 he was concerned that atom bomb testing may lead to a new ice age from a nuclear winter scenario. From 1959 until 1961 he proposed and promoted the idea of a World Weather Watch. In 1961 he served as the lead negotiator for the U.S. in talks with the U.S.S.R. concerning the joint use of meteorological satellites. He continued working at the bureau until his death in 1962. Wexler had been researching the link connecting chlorine and bromine compounds to the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layers, but died of a heart attack while on vacation in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Wexler had already accepted an invitation to deliver a lecture entitled \\"The Climate of Earth and Its Modifications\\" at the University of Maryland Space Research and Technology Institute. Another twelve years would pass before the first papers about the effect of chlorofluorocarbons on the ozone layer were published in 1974, during which CFC production had increased \\"Had Wexler lived to publish his ideas\\", author James Rodger Fleming would observe later, \\"they would certainly have been noticed and could have led to a different outcome and perhaps an earlier coordinated response to the issue of stratospheric ozone depletion.\\" He was survived by his wife Hannah, and her daughters Susan and Libby. His wife donated his papers to the Library of Congress in 1963. Honors The crater Wexler on the Moon is named after him. Volume 91, issues 10-12 of the Monthly Weather Review were published as memorial issues for Wexler. In 1977, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison founded the Harry Wexler Professorship of Meteorology.

Since the 1980s, he has written many reference books about the Beatles and has worked for EMI, MPL Communications and Apple Corps.Catching Up With Mark Lewisohn What Goes On, 4 April 2005 He has been referred to as the world's leading authority on the band\\"Historian given ¬£1.2m to write Beatles trilogy\\" The Independent, 26 April 2004 due to his meticulous research and integrity. His works include The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions (1988), a history of the group's session dates, and The Beatles: All These Years (2013‚Äìpresent), a three-volume series intended as the group's most comprehensive biography. The Beatles and related subjects Early books Lewisohn has been writing about the Beatles since 1977. When he initially began researching the band, he \\"found that it was a deep and rewarding history that was, for the most part, not very well researched by anybody else, so I just found a career by becoming a Beatles expert, I suppose you would say. Writing books and consulting on TV series, and ended up working for them. It's ridiculous. One thing just led to the next.\\" His 1986 book The Beatles Live! featured a complete history of all the Beatles' live performances, in a format which Lewisohn would follow for his subsequent books. After being invited by EMI to listen to all of the Beatles' original session tapes, Lewisohn wrote The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions (1988). The book was in the form of a diary, listing chronologically every recording session the Beatles had at Abbey Road Studios. It included details such as who played on each track and how many takes were recorded in each session. The book featured an introductory interview by Paul McCartney.\\"Travels In Music: Ep. 1: The World's Leading Beatles Historian, Author of 'Tune In' Mark Lewisohn\\". Travels In Music.

This is essentially a guide book to all the Beatles-related locations in London, including Abbey Road and the London Palladium, featuring maps and photographs of the band at the locations mentioned. A revised version of the book was published in early 2008.Mark Lewisohn at United Agents. Retrieved 19 June 2008 Other contributions As well as writing his own books, Lewisohn has written forewords to such books as Recording The Beatles by Brian Kehew and Kevin Ryan, Beatles Gear by Andy Babiuk and the German book Komm, gib mir deine Hand by Thorsten Knublauch and Axel Korinth. He has also contributed to In My Life: Lennon Remembered, a book to accompany the 10-part BBC radio series about John Lennon, and edited McCartney's book Wingspan, after working for a long time as editor and writer for McCartney's (now ceased) fanzine Club Sandwich. This led to him being invited by the former Beatle to write the liner notes for several of his albums, namely Flaming Pie, Band on the Run: 25th Anniversary Edition and Wingspan: Hits and History. He also wrote the liner notes for the retrospective six-CD box set Produced by George Martin ‚Äì 50 Years in Recording, and the Beatles' albums 1 and The Capitol Albums, Volume 1. He was heavily involved in The Beatles Anthology project. According to Daniel Finkelstein, writing in The Times in 2014, Lewisohn was responsible for identifying comedian Jasper Carrott as the source in 1983 of the famous remark, \\"Ringo isn't the best drummer in the world. He isn't even the best drummer in the Beatles.\\" This observation has generally been attributed to John Lennon, but Lewisohn had been doubtful because he could find no record of his having said it and thought it was out of character for Lennon to say something that he did not actually believe, though he was also well known for making mischievous remarks.Daniel Finkelstein, The Times, 8 March 2014 However, Lewisohn has since confirmed that the line actually originated in a 1981 episode of the BBC radio comedy series Radio Active, written by Angus Deayton and Geoffrey Perkins. The Beatles: All These Years In 2005, Lewisohn announced that he had started work on a three-volume Beatles biography.Mark Lewisohn announces new comprehensive Beatles bio What Goes On, 11 April 2005 He was quoted as saying of the work: Volume 1 was published in October 2013, entitled The Beatles: All These Years, Volume One ‚Äì Tune In. Lewisohn was quoted as saying \\"It took longer to research and write than I could ever have anticipated\\". In an interview published on 28 December 2013, Lewisohn estimated that the second volume would be published in 2020 and the final volume in 2028 (\\"about the time he turns 70\\"). However, in August 2018 Lewisohn tweeted that it was \\"way too early to say\\" when he would be able to publish Volume 2. In autumn 2019 Lewisohn toured a one-man show, Hornsey Road, around theatres in England, also stopping at Dublin and Edinburgh. The 25-date tour was an entertaining multimedia history lecture about the Beatles‚Äô last- made album, Abbey Road. The tour title referred to EMI‚Äôs 1956‚Äì57 purchase of a recording studio in Holloway, north London, where the Beatles would have recorded had, ultimately, EMI not altered its course and decided to keep all company recording at the existing studio on Abbey Road. Lewisohn‚Äôs tour achieved sell-out status in a number of venues, the proceeds helping fund his continuing writing of the history trilogy The Beatles: All These Years. Other work Although the Beatles are Lewisohn's area of particular expertise, he has also written on a variety of other subjects. One of his best-known works is an encyclopaedia of comedy on British television screens titled Radio Times Guide to TV Comedy, published in 1998 and updated in 2003, also available online as the BBC Guide to Comedy until 2007. He has also written Funny, Peculiar, a biography of Benny Hill, published in 2002. In the past, Lewisohn has written for magazines, including the Radio Times and Match of the Day.

It coincided with Mimouna. Communities would leave their villages and camp out for three days, celebrating with eating and drinking, nature walks, singing and dancing.  History  The tradition is at least 2,000-year-old. Some believe it was influenced by the Akkadian spring festival of Akitu. Others believe Seharane comes from the ancient Jewish tradition of celebrating the 1st of Nisan as a spring festival, but the date was later changed to start the day after Passover ended. Its observance was interrupted after the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries and the relocation of this community to Israel in the 1950s. In recent years it has been revived but, because of the already-widespread celebration of Mimouna in Israel, the celebration of the Seharane was moved to Chol HaMoed of Sukkot. This, though, caused a decline of the Seharane celebrations since it has always been traditionally celebrated in the springtime since ancient times. Traditionally, the Seharane has a secular component but there are special prayers dedicated to the holiday, inauguration of a Torah scrolls, and marriage celebrations, similar to the matchmaking traditions of Mimouna. Before the Jews relocated to Israel, the traditional dates of Seharane were 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of Nisan (in Kurdistan) which are the 3 days following Passover. (In Israel, it technically should have been on the 21st, 22nd and 23rd of Nisan, but there was already the Maghrebi Jewish tradition of Mimouna on 21st of Nisan, so alternative dates were given, but many in the Kurdish Jewish community want it to return springtime.) The Main Course would be brought to the campsite: # Yaprach (◊ô◊§◊®◊ê◊ö): Grape leaves stuffed with meat and rice ( ◊ô◊§◊®◊ö) (also yaprach are also prepared by stuffing Swiss chard leaves, mallow leaves, and cabbage leaves.) # Dulama (◊ì◊ï◊ú◊û◊ê): Mixed stuffed vegetables typically summer squash, eggplant, tomatoes, and onions. The typical filling would include ground meat, short grain rice, chopped onions, pine nuts, and yellow raisins. # Kubbah ·∏§amu·π£ta (◊ß◊ï◊ë◊î ◊ó◊û◊ï◊¶◊™◊ê)- Semolina kubbah are stuffed with fatty lamb, celery leaves, and garlic and then cooked in a lemon & chicken soup, which has been flavored with celery, Swiss chard, garlic and scallions (or Persian leeks). Before the meals, the maza would be served. Maza were snack foods served arak during socializing before the main course. These would include: Araqin (arak or anise liqueur), Lahmajun (Meat-covered bread dough pies), Turshi Ajare (Mixed pickles of carrots, cabbage, peppers, cauliflower),Ksesa Qilya (Fried chicken), Qoqwanta Qilya (Fried partridge), Nunyase Qilya (Fried fish), Shargome Qilya (Fried turnips), Banjane Smoqe Qilya (Fried tomatoes), Riza Kabili (Lamb and rice pilaf), Zalatet Banjane (Eggplant salad), Zalatet Khortmane (Chick pea salad), Zalatet Filfele wa Goza (a bell pepper, carrot, & walnut dip), Burek bi Spanakh (Spinach-filled cigar boreks),Kutelik (Fried bulgur kibbeh filled with meat), Orjet Khortmane (Fried chick pea balls, like falafel), Orjet Nonyase ( Fried ground fish balls), Kubbah shifteh mtuyah (grilled ground meat patties on skewers), and Keliche (Sesame-sprinkled sweet ring-shaped cookies flavored with a mix of spices). Although the Jews of Kurdistan spoke various Jewish dialects of Neo-Aramaic, it was common to sing many of the songs of Seharane in Kurdish.

He served as Governor of C√≥rdoba from May 17, 1936, to May 17, 1940. Sabattini was born in Buenos Aires to immigrant parents: His mother was Uruguayan, while his father was an Italian man from the Piedmont region. Sabattini enrolled at the National University of C√≥rdoba and graduated with a Medical Degree in 1919, becoming affiliated to the centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR) ‚Äì the party in power in Argentina at the time. A staunch opponent of the 1930 coup d'√©tat that unseated populist UCR President Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen, Sabattini went underground and participated in numerous potests, some violent, before an agreement between Conservative President Agust√≠n Justo and the leader of the UCR, former President Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, resulted in the lifting of a UCR electoral boycott in effect since the fraud- ridden 1931 elections. In this framework, Sabattini was elected Governor of the important Province of C√≥rdoba in 1936. A supporter of much of President Yrigoyen's 1916 platform, including liberalization of the universities and the establishment of State enterprises, Sabattini initiated several hydroelectric dams and supported the creation of numerous industrial zones in his then- agrarian province. He extended assistance to his province's needy and to small business, while prosecuting hitherto rampant graft and limiting the Catholic Church's input in school curricula, earning him the enmity of that influential institution. The Governor retired to his modest home in Villa Mar√≠a and in 1940, though he was ineligible for reelection per the provincial constitution, his UCR was returned to power that year, electing Governor Santiago del Castillo. Sabattini's electoral and judicial reforms, as well as C√≥rdoba Province conservatives' unwillingness to participate in the prevailing system of \\"patriotic fraud,\\" prevented the nation's ruling party (the Concordance) from seizing the Governorship. Sabattini became a supporter of many of the social reforms advanced by Labor Minister Juan Per√≥n, following a coup d'√©tat against the conservatives in 1943. Per√≥n offered Sabattini the Vice- Presidential slot on his Labor Party ticket, ahead of the February 1946 elections. The popular C√≥rdoba lawmaker declined, however, instead creating a \\"Intransigent and Renewal Movement\\", opposing to president Per√≥n but also to the right wing of Radical Party.

It was succeeded by the Federal Parliament of Somalia. Overview The Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs) were the key foundations of the national government of Somalia. Created in 2004, they included the Transitional Federal Charter (TFC), the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP). The TFP is the parliament of Somalia. It constituted the legislative branch of government, with the Transitional Federal Government representing the executive division. The Transitional Federal Parliament elected the President and Prime Minister, and had the authority to propose and pass laws. It was also in charged of governance and administration of Mogadishu, which was then the seat of the TFG. Members of Parliament (MP) were selected through traditional clan leaders or shura councils. The Federal Parliament of Somalia was established on August 20, 2012, following the end of the Transitional Federal Government's mandate. Composition The Transitional Federal Parliament, officially referred to as the Transitional Federal Assembly (TFA), was a unicameral national assembly. It was formed in 2004 and originally included 275 members. Following the creation of a unity government in 2008‚Äì2009 between the Transitional Federal Government and moderate members of the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS), the TFP's seats were increased to 550. Of those, 475 Members of Parliament were appointed following the 4.5 formula: 1 apportionment went to each of the four major Somali clans, while a coalition of minority clans received a quota of 0.5. The remaining 75 seats were reserved for business people and civil society representatives. Article 29 of the Transitional Federal Charter also stipulated that at least 12% of all parliamentary members had to be women. Speaker of Parliament The first Speaker of the Transitional Federal Parliament was Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden. He held the position from September 15, 2004 to January 17, 2007, and was succeeded by Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe. On May 25, 2010, Sharif Hassan was re-elected parliamentary Speaker.Somalia parliament elects new speaker See also *Judiciary of Somalia Notes External links *Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments ‚Äì Somalia Category:2004 establishments in Somalia Category:2012 disestablishments in Somalia Somalia Category:Elections in Somalia Category:Factions in the Somali Civil War Category:Government of Somalia Somalia Somalia Category:Political history of Somalia Category:Somalia War (2006‚Äì2009) Category:Somali Civil War (2009‚Äìpresent) Category:Transitional federal government of Somalia ","title":"Transitional federal parliament of Somalia"},{"id":"4503014","text":"1984 Lefas motorcycle (370cc Lefas engine) Lefas is the brand name of the motorcycles, engines and other systems created by the Greek engineer Thanassis Lefas. Lefas was a brilliant engineer who devoted his career in improving the motorcycle design, but not nearly as good an entrepreneur as reflected by the fate of his designs. A motorcycle enthusiast from an early age, he worked for years making improvements in motorcycles for trials races. In 1982 he decided to incorporate all his improvement ideas into a completely new motorcycle. Introduced in 1984, the 370cc motorcycle featured a large number of novel features in suspension (being the first to feature an unconventional single rear wheel support and single shock absorber), brakes, frame and engine, all entirely designed and constructed by Lefas. This superb bike was intended for production; Lefas had already planned different versions and personally worked on the infrastructure for series manufacture of all its parts, including the engine. However, he soon abandoned this project. Levels of state funding and support have been quoted as one reason, but this move was made mostly by choice, as Lefas focused entirely on a completely new design. Having \\"rejected\\" conventional front arrangement patterns (as eventually he did for the entire contemporary motorcycle design concept) as prone to instability especially during sudden turns, he developed the prototype of a completely new motorcycle between 1991 and 1994. Powered by a 900cc Ducati engine, the motorcycle incorporated a number of particularly unconventional features, including a rather complex front steering/suspension design. The prototype was tested in 1994 and exhibited superb riding performance and stability during turns; a patent application was subsequently made. Once more, though, the fate of the design was determined by Lefas‚Äôs personal choices. A plan for production in Greece failed due to disagreements on financial matters with the Greek company interested in the project. The death in 1995 of the famous motorcycle engineer John Britten, a good friend of Lefas who also proposed new ideas in motorcycle design, and the failure to convince companies abroad to incorporate his design, lead Lefas to temporarily withdraw from all original developments. He even rejected an invitation by Britten‚Äôs family to move to New Zealand and continue Britten‚Äôs work. In 2002, nonetheless, he resumed research work, developing a novel 4-stroke engine/frame unit while simultaneously working as a consultant in other engineering projects. Interest in his 1994 prototype resumed in late 2003, when a Greek businessman with investments in Austria asked Lefas to develop a new frame (incorporating his front design) around a Triumph engine with the intent to produce the bike. Work on the new frame had started when Lefas became aware of serious health problems. In a move to \\"secure\\" a reliable prototype for future production (as he realized his deteriorating condition), he chose to perfect the 1994 motorcycle model before attempting to complete the new development. Thanassis Lefas died in December 2005 at the age of 53.  References  *\\"The last motorcycle by Thanassis Lefas\\", article in (Greek) R&D; magazine, issue 14, June 2006. *L.S. Skartsis and G.A.

Ancient site of the \\"ford of hurdles\\", Dublin A hurdle (UK English, limited US English) is a moveable section of light fence. In the United States, terms such as \\"panel\\", \\"pipe panel\\" or simply \\"fence section\\" are used to describe moveable sections of fencing intended for agricultural use and crowd control; \\"hurdle\\" refers primarily to fences used as jumping obstacles for steeplechasing with horses or human track and field competition. Traditional hurdles were made from wattle, but modern designs for fencing are often made of metal. They are used for handling livestock, as decorative fencing, for steeplechasing and in the track and field event of hurdling and Shuttle Hurdle Relay. Types *Traditional hurdles are made from wattle, usually of hazel or willow. Hurdle-making is a traditional woodland craft, done by placing upright sticks in holes in a log and weaving split branches between them. Historically they were used to pen livestock or to separate land in open field systems, but they are now popular as decorative fencing for gardens. In medieval England such a hurdle was sometimes used as a makeshift sledge, to which a prisoner was tied to be dragged behind a horse to a place of execution. *Hurdles were also used for crossing rivers at fording points. Dublin's name in the Irish language means \\"ford of hurdles.\\" *Modern livestock hurdles, known as panels or \\"pipe panels\\" in the USA, are used for sorting, handling or loading animals where permanent fencing is impractical or uneconomic. They are made of steel or aluminium, and vary in size. For sheep, they are usually long and high, while for cattle they are commonly or more long and high. They are usually joined by pins or hooks, both to each other and to handling facilities such as a cattle crush. While individual hurdles are easily knocked over by animals, when joined in a ring or to solid objects they make a secure fence. Single hurdles are often used as a temporary gate or to block a gap in a hedge. Hurdles are often supplied in a set together with a mobile cattle crush and a trailer for easy transport. *Wattle hurdles are also used in hedges and river restoration. They are an environmentally friendly way of adding strength to river banks to stop erosion and create a living space for wild plants and animals. Hurdles are also used to aid the growth of new hedges. They protect the young hedge plants and will slowly rot away as the hedge grows making a stronger hedge when it is time for laying a mature hedge. *Hurdles used as jumps in hunt racing are similar to traditional hurdles. *The barriers used in human track and field hurdling vary. A bar firmly attached to two posts is used for long distances, while a light metal frame on a stand is used for sprint hurdling.

At the time it was Britain's largest robbery, netting , equivalent to ¬£ million today. Reynolds spent five years on the run before being sentenced to 25 years in 1969. He was released in 1978. He wrote three books and performed with the band Alabama 3, for whom his son, Nick, plays. Early life Bruce Richard Reynolds was born at Charing Cross Hospital, in the Strand, central London, the only child of Thomas Richard and Dorothy Margaret (n√©e Keen). He was initially brought up in Putney, and his mother, a nurse, died in 1935 when he was aged four. His father, a trade-union activist at the Ford Dagenham assembly plant, married again, and the family moved to Gants Hill. Reynolds found it difficult to live with his father and stepmother, choosing often to stay with one or other of his grandmothers. During the London Blitz of the Second World War he was evacuated to Suffolk and then to Warwickshire. On leaving school at 14¬Ω, Reynolds failed the eyesight test to join the Royal Navy, and decided he wanted to become a foreign correspondent, so he applied in person for a job at Northcliffe House. Employed first as a messenger boy, he then worked in the accounts department of the Daily Mail. By the age of 17 he had become bored with the routine and was working in the Bland/Sutton Institute of Pathology at Middlesex Hospital, before joining Claud Butler as a bicycle messenger and a member of their semi-professional racing team, where he first met criminals and began a life of crime. Career After undertaking some petty crime and spending time in HMP Wormwood Scrubs and Borstal for theft (from which he escaped and was eventually caught and sent to Reading Prison), he spent six weeks of the required two years doing National Service in the British Army, before running away to return to petty crime. Sentenced to three years in 1952 for breaking and entering, he was sent to the juvenile wing of Wandsworth Prison in London. He then graduated to jewellery theft from large country houses. In 1957 Reynolds was arrested, together with Terry Hogan, for assault and robbery of a bookmaker returning from White City Greyhounds with ¬£500. The police stated their belief that the intent of the cosh attack was grievous bodily harm and not robbery. Hogan was sentenced to 2¬Ω years and Reynolds received a year longer.Assault On Bookmaker, The Times 17 January 1958 After spending time in HMP Wandsworth and HMP Durham, on release in 1960 he then became an antiques dealer and thief.The Great Train Robbery He joined a gang with future best friend Harry Booth and future brother-in-law John Daly. Later on, he did some work with Jimmy White and met Buster Edwards at Charlie Richardson's club. Richardson in turn introduced him to Gordon Goody. Having gained the moniker Napoleon, in 1962 his gang stole ¬£62,000 in a security van robbery at London Heathrow Airport. They then attempted to rob a Royal Mail train at Swindon, which netted only ¬£700. But Reynolds, now looking for his career-criminal defining moment, started planning his next train robbery over a period of three months. Reynolds organised a gang of 15 men to undertake the 1963 Great Train Robbery (which he later referred to as his \\"Sistine Chapel ceiling\\"). After the theft, Reynolds spent six months in a mews house in South Kensington waiting for a false passport. He then travelled via Elstree Airfield to Ostend, was then driven to Brussels Airport, before flying with Sabena airlines to Mexico City via Toronto. Assuming the name Keith Clement Miller, he was joined by his wife Frances, who changed her name to Angela, and son Nick. Reynolds (far right) at Ronnie Biggs' (far left) 70th birthday with their sons For Christmas 1964, the family were joined in Acapulco by fellow train robbers Buster Edwards, who had not yet been caught, and treasurer Charlie Wilson, who had escaped from HMP Winson Green. Reynolds and his family later moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where Wilson had settled with his family, but a proposed theft of Canadian dollars was stopped due to Royal Canadian Mounted Police observation. Reynolds then moved to Vancouver, before returning that summer to the South of France. By now running low on cash, he heard a similarly sized large robbery was being planned. The family returned to London, before then moving to Torquay, Devon. Assuming the name Keith Hiller, the family began a life of settling into Reynolds' former childhood holiday town, before he had the urge to make contact with his old friends back in London. The Metropolitan Police whilst watching the London criminal scene realised that Hiller was in fact Reynolds, and arrested him in Torquay on 9 November 1968. Offered a deal by the Director of Public Prosecutions to plead guilty and avoid their pursuing his son, wife and family on further criminal charges, Reynolds agreed to plead guilty and was sentenced to 25 years. All of the Great Train robbers were held in maximum security in a specially built unit at HMP Durham. After making friends with both Charlie and Eddie Richardson whilst in prison, Reynolds was released from HMP Maidstone in 1978. After a failed attempt in the textile trade, he began trafficking and money laundering for many South London drug gangs. Arrested for dealing amphetamines, he was jailed in the 1980s for three years. Later life Reynold's grave in Highgate Cemetery. On release he gained a profile as a media \\"former criminal\\" figure, and acted as a consultant on the film Buster, with Larry Lamb portraying Reynolds. Reynolds then published his autobiography The Autobiography of a Thief (1995). In the book, Reynolds commented that the curse that followed him around, as after it no-one wanted to employ him either legally or illegally: Having either spent or had removed by courts the monies that he gained through crime, by the 1990s Reynolds was living on income support in a flat in Croydon, Greater London, supplied by a charitable trust. Reynolds' wife died before him. He died on the afternoon of 28 February 2013 at the age of 81.The \\"Train Robber House\\" At the time of his death, Reynolds was working on The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963-2013, published by Mpress in July 2013. In popular culture Multiple media properties and parodies have been produced about the Great Train Robbery [see Details of the Great Train Robbery and the robbers]. Examples featuring Bruce Reynolds include: ' (The Gentleman Prefers Payment, also known as Great British Train Robbery) which aired on ARD in 1966 and featured Horst Tappert as Reynolds, Robbery (1967) with Stanley Baker as a character based upon Reynolds, and Buster (1988) with Larry Lamb as Reynolds. In 2008, Shaun Micallef parodied Reynolds in Series 2, Episode 9 of an Australian Satirical Comedy News Series Newstopia. In 2012, Reynolds was portrayed in the television series Mrs Biggs by Jay Simpson. He was also the subject of the song \\"Have You Seen Bruce Richard Reynolds\\", originally by Nigel Denver and later covered by the UK band Alabama 3. Reynolds himself appears on the Alabama 3 version. On the day that Biggs died, 18 December 2013, the BBC broadcast the first of a two part series, The Great Train Robbery, which provides a dramatisation of the events first from the criminals' perspective and then from that of the police. The programme had already been scheduled for broadcast on that date. Bruce Reynolds was played by Welsh actor Luke Evans.

Early life From 1960 to 1963, Huckfield studied at Keble College, Oxford, graduating with a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, subsequently promoted to MA. From 1963 to 1966, he worked as a lecturer in economics at Birmingham City University (then the City of Birmingham College of Commerce) whilst studying for a Master of Commerce degree, specialising in Econometrics and Statistics. Parliamentary career Huckfield first stood for Parliament at Warwick and Leamington in 1966, but he was defeated by the Conservative incumbent John Hobson. In 1967, at the age of 24, Huckfield was elected to parliament for the constituency of Nuneaton in a by-election following the resignation of Frank Cousins, becoming the youngest MP (the \\"Baby of the House\\"). He was Under- Secretary of State for Industry from 1976 to 1979, serving under Industry Secretary Eric Varley in the government of James Callaghan. For a time he was a member of Labour's National Executive Committee, holding the Socialist Societies seat. When Labour returned to opposition in 1979, he was opposition spokesperson on industry from 1979 to 1981. He was a founding member of the Socialist Campaign Group in 1982. After being re-elected in four general elections, Huckfield did not stand when the constituency boundaries were changed for the 1983 general election. The Nuneaton seat was gained by the Conservative Lewis Stevens, who held it until 1992. Huckfield had been expected to contest the recreated Sedgefield seat for the 1983 general election, but instead Labour selected Tony Blair as their candidate, who was elected.

These variables are likely computers that are on a company's (or that company's client's) network. RIS is used to create installation images of operating systems or computer configurations, which can be used to demonstrate the installation process to users whose machines have been granted access to the RIS server. This eliminates the need to use a CD-ROM for installing an operating system. Background At boot time, a workstation that has been set to boot from PXE will issue a BOOTP request via the network. Once the request is received, the DHCP Server will supply an IP address to the machine, and the DNS server will point the client computer to the RIS server, which in turn will issue a disc boot image (often called the \\"OS Chooser\\"). Once the OS Chooser environment has been booted, the user must authenticate against the Domain Controller, and can then select a Windows image to install. The source files for each image can be customized with 3rd party utilities such as nLite to slipstream updates and service packs, apply tweaks, perform unattended installations, and include software with the operating system. History Remote Installation Services was introduced with Windows 2000 as an optional component when installed on Windows 2000 Server. Initially, it supported only the distribution of Windows 2000 Professional, but with Service Pack 3 allowed for the remote installation of Windows 2000 Server.Unable to Create Windows 2000 Server Image on RIS Server prior to SP3 RIS was updated twice; once to support Windows XP, and again to support Windows Server 2003. With the release of Service Pack 2 for Windows Server 2003, RIS was replaced with Windows Deployment Services. Overview On Windows 2003, two services are required to provide Remote Installation Services: DHCP and Remote Installation Service. The Remote Installation Server doubles as a proxy DHCP server to provide Boot Server and File name instructions to clients. Remote Installation Service utilizes UDP port 4011Service overview and network port requirements for the Windows Server system Microsoft Inc. to provide clients the contents of each page the OS Chooser displays. Additionally, this service can provide drivers to clients; it is often used to provide the workstation's network card driver, which is required to launch the OS Chooser and mount the share where images are stored. Installation Using RIS RIS can be used only for clean installations and cannot be used to upgrade a previous version of Windows. A RIPrep image can contain the operating system and applications. Computers that are connected to the same network as the server, and have been enabled, automatically start the RIS sequence. This process can be automated through what is called Remote Replication. Remote replication allows installations to be sent to a designated network share at a remote office, which can then be run by any system at that location. This allows servers to run the install automatically, eliminating the need for dedicated hardware or personnel at each facility. The primary benefit of remote replication is reduced cost and complexity of managing multi-site organizations.

It gives me a chance to say goodbye to my fans, who have been so loyal to me over the years. I hope they and the theatres will all bear with me. I feel good most of the time. But there will be bad days too. It has been a privilege to be allowed to perform my skills on a national stage and television. I have never taken that for granted and I would like to give something back and say, 'thank you for having me. It has been a real pleasure'\\".

The parish is north of Lancaster and consists of two villages; Slyne, on the A6 road, and Hest Bank on the coast. History Hest Bank ( ) is a village in north-western Lancashire, England, the boundaries of which include the coastline, from a western shoreline of salt-flats that adjoin the northern extremities of Morecambe's Victorian era Promenade, to a less clearly defined boundary in the east with the village of Slyne, which dates from Anglo-Saxon times. Notable buildings and roads Hest Bank's best-known building, 'The Hest Bank Hotel' (previously named the Sands Inn), is itself hundreds of years old, and once served as a coaching station for traffic crossing the sands of what is now called Morecambe Bay. Ordnance Survey Maps still show the right-of-way across Morecambe Bay from Hest Bank to Grange-over-Sands, and many walkers enjoy guided walks across the bay, which take place from Spring to Autumn, normally every other weekend, tides allowing. The right-of-way is not suitable for normal motor vehicles, there being water at around knee-height to cross at the outflow from the River Kent. Governance An electoral ward of the same name exists.

It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1966. It is a sociological story of urban class warfare and political intrigue, taking place in the fictional South American capital city of Vados. It explores the idea of subliminal messages as political tools, and it is notable for having the structure of a famous 1892 chess game between Wilhelm Steinitz and Mikhail Chigorin. The structure is not coincidental, and plays an important part in the story. Reception Algis Budrys found the novel to be more artifice than fiction, saying \\"this is a confusing, overpopulated, almost-unidentifiable-with story set in a city which seems to have been created for the sole purpose of having Brunner set a 'human chess game' in motion upon it. . . .

Within Islam, however, such a concept of plurality within God is a denial of monotheism and foreign to the revelation found in Muslim scripture. Shirk, the act of ascribing partners to God ‚Äì whether they be sons, daughters, or other partners ‚Äì is considered to be a form of unbelief in Islam. The Quran repeatedly and firmly asserts God's absolute oneness, thus ruling out the possibility of another being sharing his sovereignty or nature.David Thomas, Trinity, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an There has been little doubt that Muslims have rejected Christian doctrines of the Trinity from an early date, but the details of Quranic exegeses have recently become a subject of renewed scholarly debate. In the Quran Three Quranic verses may directly refer to this doctrine., , and .  * Furthermore, verses 19:88-93, 23:91, and 112:1-4 are relevant to the doctrine of \\"Trinity\\":  * Discussion Interpretation of these verses by modern scholars has been varied. Although the latter group of verses have usually been taken to reject the mainstream Christian view of Jesus as son of God, Watt has argued that they refer specifically to an unorthodox notion of \\"physical sonship\\".:47 Verse 5:73 has been interpreted as a potential criticism of Syriac literature that references Jesus as \\"the third of three\\" and thus an attack on the view that Christ was divine. Hence, verses 5:72‚Äì75 may merely be criticizing the idea that Jesus and God are the same. Alternatively, it may be a purposeful simplification of the Christian belief in the humanity and divinity of Christ in order to expose its potential weakness when viewed from the firmly monotheistic position of Islam.:47 Similarly, verse 4:171 can be read as a rejection of Jesus' divinity. It is worth noting that in explaining these verses, early Muslim Quranic commentators noted that \\"the Christian 'three' was an internal characteristic of the godhead... rather than a series of external beings placed together with God.\\" Some Muslim commentators and Western scholars believe Q as referring to Mary as part of the Christian Trinity. Critics use this to argue that the Quran's author was mistaken about orthodox Christian beliefs, wherein Mary is a human and the third part of the Trinity is the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, Muslims argue that past heretical Christians have explicitly believed Mary to be a divine being. Although some historians, such as Averil Cameron have been skeptical about whether Collyridians even existed and noted that Epiphanius is the only source for the group and that later authors simply refer to his text., at 6‚Äì7. Others argue that Q5:116 in fact does not allude to the Trinity since the term itself isn't stated in the verse and instances where the Trinity is explicitly mentioned (Q and Q), Mary's alleged divine status is not noted. Some recent Western scholarship support a rhetorical understanding of the Quranic accusation of Mary's divinity claim in Q5:116;:47 arguing the verse generally gives an example of Shirk and admonishes it.

He filled that see in 1519, when the civil war broke out in Spain. Instead of espousing the interests of the throne, he joined the insurgent comuneros. According to his critics, his choice of allegiance was purely opportunistic and due to longstanding disputes with other members of the clergy. When he appeared at Tordesillas, the general rendezvous of the discontented deputies, he was received with enthusiasm. Being entrusted with ammunition and men, he marched against the royal generals, and was for the most part successful. In the view of identifying religion with liberty, he raised a regiment of priests, whom he always conducted to battle; and though 60 years of age, he was sure to be right in the middle of the action. \\"Follow me, my parson!\\" was his usual exhortation, as he plunged into the dense ranks of the enemy. By the Conde de Haro, the rebels were at length defeated; but the priests stood firm; and dreadful was the carnage which they produced among the royalists. One of them slew eleven by himself. He was alleged to have given his benediction to foes on the field, making the sign of the cross with his musket before firing. When Toledo was besieged by the royalists, the bishop hastened to that city, not so much to assist Maria Pacheco in repelling the assailants, as to seize the vacant archbishopric. By the populace he was speedily proclaimed; and when the chapter refused to elect him, he and Maria committed the members to prison and the latter were compelled to live on bread and water until they had not only elected him, but given up their treasures for the use of the insurgents. After Juan de Padilla was imprisoned on 24 April 1521, the royalist cause triumphed. The fortresses submitted, and the bishop fled towards France. In Navarre, however, he was recognized, seized, and sent to the dungeon of Simancas. There he broke the head of the alcalde with a brick, and was escaping, when the son of the officer discovered and secured him. This was his last act of violence. By a papal bull, he was degraded, and delivered over to the secular arm. He was tried, sentenced, and beheaded in prison.

The Foyle Bridge is a bridge in Derry, Northern Ireland. The central cantilever span of the bridge is the second longest on the island of Ireland, at 234 metres (767 ft), and the whole suspended bridge structure including the approach spans is 866 metres long (2839 ft). It crosses the River Foyle to the north of the city, and forms only the second of three bridges linking the city centre to the Waterside, the others being the Craigavon Bridge and the Peace Bridge walkway. Work on the bridge began in 1980 and it opened in October 1984. The seven approach spans on the east bank are of pre-stressed concrete box construction. The three main river spans are of steel box construction and were built by Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast in 6 segments, weighed up to 900 tonnes each, and then transported by barge and oceangoing tug to site where they were lifted into position. Between 2003 and 2005 the bridge underwent strengthening, resurfacing and other improvements, leading to widespread traffic disruption in the city. Total cost of the refurbishment work was ¬£10.6 million. The road was built to four-lane dual carriageway standard, and carries the A515. By 2004 more than 30,000 vehicles used the bridge every day. The bridge was built for the Roads Service of Northern Ireland by RDL- John Graham (Dromore) Joint Venture, with the consulting engineers being Ove Arup and Partners. The value of the four-year construction contract was ¬£15,765,000. It was the first bridge in Ireland to be built according to a 'Design and Construct' system, whereby the same firm designed and constructed the bridge. History The bridge crosses the Foyle at Madam's Bank, which is the same site as King James II's army chose to place their boom barrier during the Siege of Derry in 1688‚Äì1689. It is the third bridge across the River Foyle to be officially named 'Foyle Bridge'. The oldest Foyle Bridge still in existence, an iron railway bridge that crossed the Foyle near Porthall, a village just north of Lifford, carried the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) (the G.N.R.) line from Strabane and through The Laggan district in East Donegal. This railway line, which ran via St. Johnston, had its terminus at Foyle Road in Derry. Parts of this bridge still stand. The other bridge with this name is better known as Lifford Bridge, a 1960s structure that was officially named 'Foyle Bridge' when it opened. Lifford Bridge is a concrete road bridge between Lifford and Strabane. Incidents and accidents In 1984, while drilling the steel parapets during the bridge\`s construction, Kevin Ross (35), was knocked off the side into the water below when drilling equipment he was using failed, resulting in said equipment losing its magnetic base capability and hitting him in the chest. He was retrieved by standby river safety staff on duty, but unfortunately did not survive. In January 2005 during a storm, a lorry was blown off the bridge and its driver, Peter McGuinness, killed. An investigation was launched since the storm had not been unusually severe, and it was concluded that a freak gust had contributed to the accident. However, due to the danger from cross winds, the bridge is now closed to traffic when the weather is particularly windy. Windsocks and warning signs are in place at each end to alert the drivers of HGVs. A new bridge management system was put in place following a review. When wind speeds reach the first trigger level of 30 mph, signs on the bridge will display an advisory speed limit of 30 mph. If the wind speeds increase to 40 mph, signs on the bridge approaches will direct high-sided vehicles to use the Craigavon Bridge instead. When the wind speed exceeds 50 mph the Foyle Bridge will be closed to all vehicles.

He spent six months in a friend's basement where he wrote all ten songs for his new project's debut album. He recruited the help of some old friends, A.J. Mogis (of Presto! Recording Studios and Lullaby for the Working Class) on bass guitar, Aaron Druery on guitar, and Mike Sweeney of Beep Beep on drums. Their first album, En Garde, was released on his previous band's label, Initial Records. Steve Pedersen eventually got a day job as a lawyer, making it hard for the band to go on tour to promote their new album. Initial Records went bankrupt about a year after, leaving Criteria without a label. Saddle Creek Records took their longtime friend in and put out three releases in 2005. The first was a re- release of the overlooked and underrated En Garde, their new single, \\"Prevent the World,\\" and their second full-length, When We Break. After being moved into Saddle Creek, Pedersen quit his day job to spend full-time making music and touring. Criteria has performed with bands such as Cursive, The Fall of Troy, Thunderbirds Are Now!, Statistics, Poison the Well, Rahim (band), and Minus the Bear. The band performed at the Maha Musical Festival on August 17, 2013 in Omaha, Nebraska. Criteria's most recent performance took place on December 12, 2013 at the Waiting Room Lounge in Omaha, during which Pedersen mentioned the band was working on a new album.

He began his career in intelligence in 1900, and remained active until his death.  Early life  Dansey was born in 1876 at 14 Cromwell Place into a dysfunctional family of nine children, their mother, Hon Eleanor Dansey, daughter of Robert, 2nd Baron Gifford, who was probably an alcoholic. The siblings were subjected to military discipline at the hands of their soldier father (Edward Mashiter Dansey), with punishments that included beatings even for minor misbehaviour. At the age of 17 he became sexually involved with Robert Baldwin Ross, and Lord Alfred Douglas, narrowly avoiding exposure and imprisonment. He was educated at Wellington College and the English College, Bruges, Belgium.  Later life  In 1895 he joined the Matabeleland Regiment of the British South African Police. On 13 June 1898 he joined the militia as second lieutenant in the 5th and 6th battalions Lancashire Fusiliers, being promoted to lieutenant on 9 November. On 16 August 1899 he was seconded for service with the British North Borneo Company. He transferred to the regular army when he was appointed a second lieutenant of the 2nd battalion on 24 February 1900, followed by promotion to lieutenant on 15 August 1900. On 1 March 1902 he was again seconded, as a Staff Lieutenant for Intelligence in South Africa, then on 24 June he was appointed aide-de- camp to the Brigadier-General commanding the Harrismith District, Charles James Blomfield. He was transferred from a supernumerary lieutenancy onto the establishment of his regiment on 17 September 1902. On 4 November 1904 he was seconded for \\"special extra-regimental employment\\" as a Political Advisor in the British Somaliland Protectorate and on 24 October 1906 he resigned his commission. On 10 April 1907 he was promoted to captain on the Reserve of Officers. He was recruited by MI5 and put in charge of \\"port intelligence\\" and the surveillance of civilian passengers during World War I. He was \\"inadvertently\\" responsible for allowing Leon Trotsky to return to Russia in 1917. He helped set up the first American military intelligence service in 1917. He became deputy to Stewart Menzies, chief of MI6 (SIS) in November 1939 and retired in 1945.  Personal life  Dansey married Mrs Pauline Monroe Ulman (maiden surname Cory) in 1915 and they were later divorced. He married Mrs Frances Gurney Rylander (Maiden surname Wilson) in 1945. There were no children. Dansey died on 11 June 1947 in Bath, Somerset.

Among the technologies explored were close-coupled canards, fully digital flight control (including propulsion), composite materials (graphite and fiberglass), remote piloting, synthetic vision systems, winglets, and others. Two aircraft were produced by Rockwell International. Their first flights took place in 1979, and testing was completed in 1983. Design and development The HiMATs were remotely piloted, as the design team decided that it would be cheaper and safer to not risk a pilot's life during the experiments. This also meant that no ejection seat would have to be fitted. The aircraft was flown by a pilot in a remote cockpit, and control signals up-linked from the flight controls in the remote cockpit on the ground to the aircraft, and aircraft telemetry downlinked to the remote cockpit displays. The remote cockpit could be configured with either nose camera video or with a 3D synthetic vision display called a \\"visual display\\". The aircraft were launched from a B-52 Stratofortress at altitude. There was also a TF-104G Starfighter chase plane with a set of backup controls which could take control of the HiMAT in the event that the remote pilot on the ground lost control. Advances in digital flight control gained during the project contributed to the Grumman X-29 experimental aircraft, and composite construction are used widely on both commercial and military aircraft. Initial concept included a wedge-shaped exhaust nozzle with 2D thrust vectoring.https://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/historic/Test_328:_HiMAT_Wedge_Nozzle Aircraft on display The two HiMAT aircraft are now on display, one at the National Air and Space Museum and the other at the Armstrong Flight Research Center.

It is located south of Druid Hill Park, north of Bolton Hill, east of Penn-North, and west of Jones Falls. It is bounded by Druid Park Lake Drive, the Jones Falls Expressway, North Avenue (U.S. Route 1), and McCulloh Street. It is contained in the 21217 ZIP code. About the area Reservoir Hill has some of the best examples of Victorian, Italianate and Second Empire style homes in Baltimore. The housing stock features a wide variety of nineteenth century architecture, including ornate Victorian mansions overlooking the Druid Hill Park, brownstones, and the smaller brick rowhouses that characterize much of Baltimore. Part of Reservoir Hill is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Although restoration efforts have brought new life to portions of the area, many houses are in poor condition. Portions of Reservoir Hill are within easy walking distance of the North Avenue station on the Baltimore Light Rail line and the Penn-North station on the Baltimore Metro Subway, as well as Pennsylvania Station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Baltimore was the second largest port for immigrants coming to the United States behind Ellis Island of New York, and many of these immigrants lived in Reservoir Hill. Many came over from the Russian Empire (mostly Jews and Ukrainians), and certain parts of Reservoir Hill housed many migrants from other parts of Eastern Europe. A synagogue originally built in Reservoir Hill by the Chizuk Amuno Congregation in 1922 is now the home of Beth Am, one of two non-Orthodox Jewish congregations located within the city limits of Baltimore. Mount Royal A section of Reservoir Hill is known as Mount Royal. It is just across North Avenue from Bolton Hill and close to the Jones Falls. It is generally more expensive and contains very well preserved homes. A portion of this has been declared the Mount Royal Terrace Historic District by Baltimore City. Notable residents Writer Gertrude Stein lived in Reservoir Hill for a short period of time on Linden Avenue, near Whitelock Street in what is also called the David Bachrach House. Pulitzer Prize winning poet Karl Shapiro was born on Brooks Lane in Reservoir Hill. Shapiro was appointed the fifth Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1946.Baltimore Sun. \\"Obituary for Karl Shapiro\\" Soviet spies Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers lived in the area. Hiss grew up on 1427 Linden Avenue. Chambers lived on Mount Royal Terrace just prior to his defection from the Soviet Underground in April 1938. Earlier in the 1930s, he lived on Eutaw Place. Spy photographer Felix Inslerman worked for Chambers and lived on Callow Avenue.  Mt. Royal Terrace (1890-1940)  The Baltimore City directories from Enoch Pratt Free Library indicate that many residents of Mt. Royal lived in their homes for several decades. It was a community based neighborhood where everyone knew each other.Enoch Pratt Free Library The Baltimore City directories also show that many residents were employees of blue collar companies. Many people from these blocks were either factory workers, construction workers, electricians, police officers, nurses, etc. The historical Baltimore Sun contains a vast amount of information regarding residents of Mt. Royal Terrace between 1890 - 1940. Many residents of Mt. Royal lived quiet hard working lives. One man named Samuel W. Filbert is an example of a common Mt. Royal resident. Filbert resided on 2200 Mt. Royal Terrace with his wife \\"Miss May (Filbert).\\"Bride is Well Known\\" Baltimore Sun. August 7, 1903. Pro Quest Historical Newspapers. The Historical Baltimore Sun Samuel, like many of the Mt. Royal residents worked a rigorous blue collar job as a construction worker for the \\"Filbert Paving and Construction Company.\\"\\"Brick and Clay Record.\\" University of Michigan. August 1917. It was a family owned business located in Baltimore. Samuel was the General manager of the company until he joined the military. Like many young men, Filberts career was affected by World War I. Filbert became a soldier in the 4th Maryland Regiment where he would soon be promoted to Lieutenant - Colonel of the infantry.\\"Captain Filbert Wins.\\" Baltimore Sun. October 21, 1913. Pro Quest Historical Newspapers. Historical Baltimore Sun Filbert became a very decorated military figure in the Mt. Royal area. He was held several titles in the 4th Regiment of Maryland including Captain and Lieutenant - Colonel. Samuel W. Filbert represented the common lifestyle of a resident in not only the Mt. Royal area, but Baltimore city during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The people in these areas were very hard working, communal, and loyal to the area. Many of the residents passed their homes off to their children, nephews, and nieces. 1890 - 1940 was a hard time in American History. The Great Depression greatly affected many lives during the 1920s, 30s and 40s. Many residents of Baltimore lost job opportunities. Many young men took advantage of joining the military. The Filbert Paving and Construction Company went out of business right after the stock market crash of 1929. Samuel Filbert elected to join the military in order to earn some type of wage. In the military he was fortunate enough to become very successful. Despite The Great Depression, Mt. Royal still remained very much alive. Eutaw Place and Madison Park Eutaw Place and Madison Park is also designated as a historic district. It is located on the western side of Reservoir Hill. This section of the neighborhood includes many grand houses on Eutaw Place and Madison Avenue, as well three large apartment buildings that are located directly across from Druid Hill Park on Madison and Eutaw. Chauncey Brooks' mansion Cloverdale was once located in this area.

It extends for from an intersection with NY 96 in Brighton to a junction with NY 350 in Walworth. The route starts as a four-lane divided highway in Brighton and western Penfield, and gradually narrows to a two-lane undivided road as it heads away from the city of Rochester. NY 441 connects to Interstate 490 (I-490) in Brighton and intersects NY 250 in Penfield. NY 441 was originally routed on Penfield Road between Brighton and Penfield when it was assigned in 1949. It remained on Penfield Road through Penfield and into Wayne County to Marion, where the highway ended at NY 21\\\\. The entirety of this routing had previously been part of NY 33, which was truncated westward to downtown Rochester as part of NY 441's assignment. NY 441 was cut back to NY 350 in Walworth by 1970. The divided highway that now carries NY 441 through Brighton and western Penfield was constructed during the late 1960s and opened as a realignment of NY 441 by 1971. Route description West of Penfield NY 441 begins at an intersection with NY 96 (East Avenue) in the Monroe County town of Brighton. This portion of NY 441 is named Linden Avenue; the road continues west of Route 96 as Elmwood Avenue. Just east of Route 96, Route 441 meets I-490 at exit 23\\\\. Past the interchange, NY 441 turns southeastward and becomes a divided highway. The portion of NY 441 from East Avenue to the Wayne County line is designated as the \\"Korean War Memorial Highway\\" by the state of New York. NY 153 and NY 441 as seen from Panorama Trail southbound Linden Avenue separates from NY 441 roughly from I-490 and follows a routing parallel to NY 441 on the opposite side of the nearby Rochester Subdivision, a double-tracked rail line owned by CSX Transportation. Continuing onward, Route 441 curves eastward and crosses over the CSX railroad line ahead of another intersection with Linden Avenue in the town of Pittsford. Linden Avenue crosses NY 441 and heads southeastward toward East Rochester; however, NY 441 curves northeastward to enter the town of Penfield. Although this portion of NY 441 is surrounded by woodlands, it is actually located in a largely developed area of Penfield known locally as Panorama. The woods cease as NY 441 approaches an interchange with Panorama Trail (NY 153), the lone limited-access junction along the divided highway. East of NY 153, NY 441 crosses over Irondequoit Creek and downgrades to a four-lane undivided highway at a junction with Penfield Road. Here, Route 441 becomes Penfield Road and enters the densely populated hamlet of Penfield. Penfield and Wayne County In Penfield, Route 441 passes through the commercial town center and intersects Five Mile Line Road at the Four Corners of Penfield. The junction with Five Mile Line Road was once the northern terminus of NY 253. As NY 441 heads east through the town of Penfield, the businesses are largely replaced by residences. The one exception to this is in the immediate vicinity of Lloyd's Corners‚Äîthe intersection of NY 441 and NY 250‚Äîwhere three of the four corners of the junction are occupied by large strip malls. The level of development along NY 441 begins to decline east of NY 250, where the road narrows to two lanes. The surroundings become largely undeveloped by the point where NY 441 enters Wayne County. Now in the town of Walworth, NY 441 becomes Walworth‚ÄìPenfield Road. Just east of the county line, NY 441 shifts slightly northward by way of an S-curve that serves as a connector between the segmented West Walworth Road, which NY 441 intersects at both ends of the curve. This is the last curve along NY 441 as it follows a linear east‚Äìwest routing over several small hills to a junction with NY 350 west of the hamlet of Walworth, where NY 441 terminates. The roadway, however, continues east to Marion as Walworth‚ÄìPenfield Road, Walworth‚ÄìMarion Road, and Buffalo Street, a continuous highway maintained by Wayne County as County Route 205 (CR 205) west of Hall Center Road and Maple Avenue and as CR 207 east of those roads. History Origins and designation Sign on Penfield Road (former NY 441) in Panorama directing traffic bound for eastern Penfield Road (NY 441) onto Panorama Trail The portion of NY 441 from where Penfield Road leaves NY 441 in Penfield to Walworth was originally designated as part of NY 33 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. West of the Four Corners of Penfield, NY 33 remained on Penfield Road through Penfield and Brighton to the modern intersection of Penfield Road and NY 96 (East Avenue). The route turned west to follow East Avenue into Rochester. On its eastern end, NY 33 continued on to Marion, where it ended at NY 21.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering NY 33 was truncated to its current eastern terminus at NY 31 in downtown Rochester on January 1, 1949. The portion of former NY 33 east of NY 96 was redesignated as NY 441. Like NY 33 before it, NY 441 officially ended at NY 21 in Marion when it was first assigned. By 1970, the east end of the route was moved to NY 350 in Walworth. The change in NY 441's alignment had no effect on the maintenance of the Walworth‚ÄìMarion highway, however, as the Wayne County portion of NY 441 was entirely county- maintained. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY 441 from the Monroe County line to NY 350 was transferred from Wayne County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the county received a part of NY 21 in Williamson that connected to a state highway at only one end. Brighton‚ÄìPenfield divided highway Construction on a new divided highway through the towns of Brighton and Penfield began in the late 1960s and was completed by 1971, at which time it became a realignment of NY 441\\\\. At the western end, NY 441 was routed onto the pre-existing Linden Avenue to connect to NY 96 at a junction southeast of its original western terminus. While most of Linden Avenue was transferred to the state, the westernmost section from NY 96 to I-490 was maintained by Monroe County as part of CR 15. The portion of NY 441's former routing on Penfield Road from NY 96 to Panorama Trail was transferred to Monroe County and designated CR 269. In 2007, ownership and maintenance of the county- maintained portion of NY 441 near its west end was transferred to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and Monroe County. A bill (S4856, 2007) to enact the swap was introduced in the New York State Senate on April 23 and passed by both the Senate and the New York State Assembly on June 20\\\\. The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August 28\\\\. Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November 26, 2007. The entirety of NY 441 is now maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation.

The school's motto is \\"Aspire, Enjoy, Achieve.\\" .  History  The buildings in which Oldbury Wells School is today based were originally two separate schools. What is now known as the East Side was opened as Bridgnorth Boys‚Äô Modern School in 1958; the West Side opened as Bridgnorth Girls‚Äô Modern School in 1959. The two schools merged to form Oldbury Wells during 1973/4. This gives the school its somewhat strange characteristic of being split over two sites separated by a quiet cul-de-sac. The gymnasium facilities for the separate sexes still remain on their original designated sites; east for the boys and west for the girls. The school's intake covers a wide and mostly rural geographic area around the Severn Valley, and has the notable statistic that more than three-quarters of the pupils are bussed in from surrounding villages. East Building Oldbury Wells School was granted Grade II listed building status in 1983. It was put onto the register of listed buildings due to its design and the construction methods used. The architects were the London practice Lyons, Israel and Ellis. They were a company who produced buildings which were consistent and recognisable. They built schools but also completed projects of national significance such as the Wolfson Institute and the then Polytechnic of Central London. The building design has its origins in the ‚ÄúModern Movement‚Äù and this was combined with Dutch and Scandinavian modernism to produce what is now Oldbury Wells. The outlines of their buildings were often developed quickly ‚Äì the divided blocks were linked by linear corridors but development could be quite protracted with weeks being devoted to details such as a gate or window style. The East Side (Bridgnorth Boy‚Äôs Secondary Modern School) was built in 1958. The assistant working on the project was P. Yarker; the structural consultants were Ove Arup and the main contractor was A.H. Guest. The assembly hall formed the heart of the building ‚Äì it was enclosed by offices, cloakrooms and toilets on the ground floor, with teaching rooms above. This unit was linked to a science block and a handicraft block with the gymnasium added later. The building has an exposed reinforced concrete frame. Suspended floors have prestressed concrete beams with foam slag infill panels. Roofs were timber units with cork and three layers of felt. The windows had varnished Columbian pine frames with metal projector opening lights. Brickwork was used inside and outside of the building and left unfaced. The outer walls were also, in places, faced with precast concrete slabs with white marble aggregate. West Building The West Side (Bridgnorth Girl‚Äôs Secondary Modern School) was built in 1960. The assistants working on the project were P. Yarker and A. Colquhoun; the structural consultants were Ove Arup and the main contractor was A.H. Guest. The building was designed for later extension by the addition of the gymnasium and further classrooms. The plan of the building was a long rectangle containing all but the craft rooms (a separate single storey block) and the kitchen. The southern part of the building consisted of the assembly and group instruction areas, with classrooms to the north. The entrance hall contains the main staircase ‚Äì the glass wall here was set back to form a deep double height porch. The associated boiler flue and tank room were positioned to give the shortest possible service runs and to give emphasis to the entrance. The structural concrete was left exposed both inside and outside the building. Internal partitions were plastered and painted white but small areas of primary colour were placed at significant points throughout the building. The outer walls and window frames were designed with a complexity to act as a foil to the overall grid structure and to allow the spaces behind to flow across the building.  Awards and accolades  The school's buildings were listed during the 1990s. They were deemed to be of historical interest because of the way the concrete displays the grain of the wood shuttering into which it was poured. It was one of the first modern buildings to be built solely out of concrete.

Currently, she focuses on the study of global microstructures and Social studies of finance. Knorr Cetina is the Otto Borchert Distinguished Service Professor (Jointly Appointed in Anthropology) and Chair of the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago. A knowledge object is a theoretical concept introduced by Knorr Cetina to describe the emergence of post-social relations in epistemic cultures. Knowledge objects are different from everyday things and are defined as unfolding structures that are non-identical with themselves; Jyri Engestr√∂m based the concept of social objects on this concept. Education and career Knorr-Cetina studied at the University of Vienna, receiving a Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology (with a minor in sociology) in 1971. Her dissertation research focused on the structural analysis of oral literature. She shifted her focus toward sociology as she found that cultural anthropology at the time was too focused on historical concerns, while she was more interested in contemporary social phenomena. Following the completion of her doctorate, Knorr-Cetina went to the Institute for Advanced Studies in Vienna, where many influential sociologists were invited to give presentations. This resulted in a Post-doctoral diploma in sociology, and an appointment as an instructor in anthropology at the University of Vienna from 1972‚Äì73, and then in sociology from 1973-76. During this time, Knorr-Cetina engaged in her first empirical investigations of science leading the 1975 publication (with Hermann Strasser and Hans Georg Zilian) Determinants and Controls of Scientific Development. It was also during these years that she first encountered the work of the ethnomethodologically-inclined sociologist Aaron Cicourel, specifically \\"Method and measurement in sociology.\\" From 1976-77, Knorr-Cetina received a Ford Foundation Fellowship to study at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at the University of California, Berkeley. Shortly before her arrival in California, the French philosopher- turned-sociologist Bruno Latour and British sociologist Steven Woolgar began their well known \\"laboratory studies\\" at the Salk Institute in southern California. Korr-Cetina's work at Berkeley ultimately contributed to this network of laboratory studies in the late 1970s, which would eventually become the field of the Social Studies of Science and Technology. The empirical research conducted while at Berkeley also became her widely cited 1981 publication The Manufacture of Knowledge: An Essay on the Constructivist and Contextual Nature of Science. Knorr-Cetina also received her Habilitation in sociology at the University of Bielefeld in 1981, and served as Professor of Sociology at Bielefeld from 1983 to 2001. Her work in the social studies of science during these years culminated in her widely-cited book Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge, published in 1999. Knorr-Cetina's progression to understanding how technology mediates sociality led her to select global financial markets as a new \\"laboratory\\" to study knowledge in society. The first suggestion of this new field site was in the article \\"Sociality with objects: Social relations in postsocial knowledge societies\\" (1997), followed later by a conference on \\"The Status of the Object in Social Science\\" at Brunel University in September 1999. The paper she presented at this conference, entitled \\"The Market as an Object of Attachment: Exploring Postsocial Relations in Financial Markets\\", was later published in 2000. Her co-author was Urs Bruegger, a former foreign exchange dealer. The two collaborated on over a dozen articles on global financial markets. Sociology of Global Financial Systems With the turn of the century, Knorr Cetina became interested in global financial markets as an object of study. From early work with Urs Bruegger, we see this developing into a strong research interest. This work is enhanced by the application of tools from science studies and the sociology of knowledge, for example, imagining \\"the market\\" as an object of attachment for traders or using market infrastructure (e.g. Bloomberg terminals) to see the microconstruction of the global market in the space of the local. The financial market infrastructure also comprises a \\"global scopic system\\" that integrates news and information across the world. The Synthetic Situation: Interactionism for a Global World Knorr Cetina‚Äôs lecture ‚ÄúThe Synthetic Situation: Interactionism for a Global World‚Äù from 2008 is vital in rethinking past assumptions about communication and interaction order previously published by sociologists, namely Erving Goffman.Knorr Cetina, Karin. \\"The Synthetic Situation: Interactionism for a Global World.\\" Lecture. Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction. Boston. 1 Aug. 2008. CBBcat. In the lecture, which was eventually published in 2009, Knorr Cetina introduces and explains new concepts regarding global interaction. Although Goffman is widely published and read in these areas, much has changed since his day and Knorr Cetina conceptualized such changes. The introduction of the ‚Äúsynthetic situation‚Äù is arguably one of her most important new concepts. It is defined as a situation that ‚Äú‚Ä¶invariably includes, and may in fact be entirely constituted by, on-screen projections‚Ä¶‚Äù. A synthetic situation, therefore, can manifest in many ways, both informal and formal. Examples include an online video chat, playing video games against others on the Internet or even a business deal done via videoconference. This idea can be seen as a result of the advancement in technology in recent years, and adds a new dimension to Goffman‚Äôs social situation where face-to-face interaction is required. Knorr Cetina explains the difference of the two situations by the use of surgery. A Goffmanian situation occurs when there is just the surgeon and the patient. A synthetic situation arises, however, when the surgeon uses technology like a scope and a screen in order to accomplish the task at hand. Without looking at the patient through the screen, the job would not be able to be done and would remain a face-to-face, social situation.

General Assembly has 130 voting members: 99 representatives and 30 senators, the Vice President of the Republic, who serves as President of the General Assembly, and the Senate has the right to vote. The legislature meets in the Legislative Palace in Montevideo. Both senators and representatives are chosen through proportional representation for five-year terms. The General Assembly holds its sessions in the Chamber of Representatives of the Legislative Palace. During the 19th century, the legislature met in the Montevideo Cabildo.  History  In 1828, on the initiative of Juan Antonio Lavalleja, delegates were elected to what was to be the Parliament of the Eastern Province of R√≠o de la Plata. As a consequence of the Treaty of Montevideo, such institution became the General Constituent and Legislative Assembly of the State, and had among other tasks the drafting of the country's first Constitution. The Assembly was unicameral. But since the establishment of the Constitution in 1830, the Uruguayan Parliament became bicameral, and has remained so to this day. The voting system of its members also changed: during the 19th century, voting was reserved for a minority, and senators represented departments. Later, the secret and universal vote was established, and the representativeness of the senators, who are elected at the national level, was reformulated.  Attributes  The ordinary sessions span is from March 1 to December 15, or until September 15 in the event that elections are held, since the new Assembly must begin its sessions on February 15 of the following year. Article Ninety of the Uruguayan Constitution requires that members of the Chamber of Representatives must be aged at least 25 and have been a citizen of Uruguay for five years. While Article Ninety- eight requires that the members of the Senate must be at least 30 years old and have been Uruguayan citizens for seven years. The General Assembly is entitled to politically judge the conduct of the Ministers of State, to declare war and to approve or reject peace treaties, alliances, commerce, and conventions or contracts of any nature that the Executive Power enters into with foreign powers and designate every year the necessary armed force, as well as allowing foreign troops to enter the country. Denying or granting the departure of national forces outside the nation is also among the functions of the Assembly. The creation of new Departments, the setting of their limits, as well as the establishment of customs and export and import duties concern the legislative power, in addition to other functions established in Article Eighty-Five of the Constitution.

The Library of the Legislative Power of Uruguay is a specialized institution whose main objective is to assist Uruguayan legislators and the cultural development of the community in the fulfillment of its functions, in order to provide documentation, information and advice to citizens, thanks to extensive bibliographic, jurisprudential, doctrinal and legislative collection. It is considered the second most important library in Uruguay, behind the National Library, due to the large collection and the status of parliamentary and public library. The current library was founded on August 25, 1929 and has its origin in the unification of the libraries of the Chamber of Representatives and the Chamber of Senators.

The station was opened in 1859 and served as the terminus of the -long line to Vincennes and Verneuil-l'√âtang. The line was opened only to serve the Fort de Vincennes, and was extended to La Varenne and later to Brie-Comte- Robert. The line finally reached Verneuil-l'√âtang in 1892, and connected to the line to Mulhouse. Part of the line was included into the RER A on 14 December 1969. The station was demolished in 1984 so that the Op√©ra Bastille could be built. History Designed by Fran√ßois-Alexis Cendrier, the Gare de la Bastille was one of Paris's earliest railway termini. In 1853, the French government decided that a strategic connection with the fort at Vincennes was desirable. The Compagnie du Chemin de Fer de Paris √† Strasbourg was granted a concession to build the line, and a connecting line to Mulhouse. The Mulhouse line would share the Gare de Strasbourg (now the Gare de Paris-Est), but the Ligne de Vincennes would also create a new terminus close to the centre of Paris, the Gare de la Bastille. In 1853, the company, now known as the Chemins de fer de l'Est (CF de l'Est), opened the -long line between Vincennes and La Varenne. The extension to Paris opened on 22 September 1859. and the line was soon carrying 6,000,000 passengers each year. In 1871, following the end of the Franco-Prussian War, France lost Alsace-Lorraine to Germany. This drastically reduced the territory served by the CF de l'Est. As a result, the Gare de l'Est was developed to become the CF de l'Est's main station in Paris. Although the Gare de la Bastille was only a local terminus, by 1889 it was the second busiest in Paris, handling 12,000,000 passengers per annum. The Ligne de Vincennes was extended to Verneuil-l'√âtang in 1892, making it long. The station served commuters during the week, and Parisians escaping to the country on weekends. By the 1920s, the Gare de la Bastille was handling 30,000,000 passengers each year. Electric traversers were installed to allow longer trains to be handled. Along with the Depression of the 1930s came increased competition from buses and the M√©tro. Passenger numbers decreased by half, and the CF de l'Est attempted to close the line. Permission for this was refused but the section between Brie-Comte-Robert and Verneuil-l'Etang was closed to passengers in 1939, though it was temporarily revived during and for a while after the Second World War. In 1945, the Gare de la Bastille became for a few months what it had originally been intended to be, a main line terminus or Gare des Grande Lignes. This followed the wartime destruction of a viaduct at Nogent-sur-Marne that had cut the main line from the Gare de l'Est to Mulhouse so long-distance trains were diverted to Bastille. In 1953, the Ligne de Vincennes closed to passengers beyond Boissy-Saint-L√©ger. Viaduc des Arts In the mid-1960s, construction of the R√©seau Express R√©gional (RER) began. The Ligne de Vincennes as far as Boissy-Saint-L√©ger was to become part of a high-speed m√©tro and its first would be replaced with a new underground line. The last train departed the Gare de la Bastille at 00:50 on 15 December 1969, hauled by locomotive 141 TB 432. The Gare de la Bastille was the last terminus in Paris operated entirely by steam locomotives. Following closure, the station buildings became a concert and exhibition hall. A number of pop concerts were held there and in 1976, a major model railway exhibition. The station buildings were listed as being of historic importance but despite this, they were demolished in 1984 to make way for the Op√©ra Bastille. The long viaduct which formed the approach to the station survives. The former rail lines are now the Promenade plant√©e, whilst the arches now form the Viaduc des Arts, located alongside the Avenue de Daumesnil. Services Trains at Mantes-sur-Seine, \\"Bidel\\" carriages in use When the station opened in 1859, services were provided by 2-4-0 locomotives. There was no room at the Gare de la Bastille for a turntable, and these locomotives were replaced by 2-4-0T locomotives (CF de L'Est Class 120) by the 1870s. These in turn were replaced by 0-6-2T locomotives (later SNCF Class 031TA) and 2-6-2T (later SNCF Class 131TA) locomotives. From 1925, larger 2-6-2T locomotives (later SNCF Class 131TB) worked the line. From the 1960s, SNCF class 141TB 2-8-2T locomotives worked the line. Early passenger carriages were of a double-deck type known as \\"Imperials\\". From the 1890s, these were replaced by another double-deck type known as \\"Bidels\\". Trains usually included a fourgon (brake van) at each end of the train to save time by removing the need for shunting. The \\"Bidels\\" were in service until 1949 on the Ligne de Vincennes and for a few years later elsewhere. An \\"Imperial\\" and a \\"Bidel\\" are preserved at the Mus√©e Fran√ßais du Chemin de Fer in Mulhouse. After the end of the Second World War, bogie carriages previously in service with the Deutsche Reichsbahn were used. These were known by the French as \\"Bastilles\\". Following the electrification of the line serving the Gare de l'Est in the early 1960s, push‚Äìpull stock replaced the \\"Bastilles\\". They were used until the line closed in 1969. The Gare de la Bastille was, except possibly in its earliest days, an almost purely passenger station. Parcels and post were handled but almost the only freight was coal for the three-road engine shed. General freight was handled at a goods station located at the other end of the viaduct at Reuilly but the Gare de la Bastille did handle one rather unusual traffic. Following devastation by phylloxera and increased competition from wine shipped in by rail, vineyards that had traditionally supplied Paris in the area served by the outer rural section of the Ligne de Vincennes switched to growing roses. A Train des Roses was introduced as early as 1897, arriving at the Gare de la Bastille in the early hours. The roses were sold in the markets at Les Halles. Traffic peaked at over 1,000,000 roses per night. By the First World War, there were 45 arrivals and departures daily. Eight trains a day ran the full length of the line to Verneuil-l'Etang, with stations closer to Paris receiving a more frequent service than those further away. Between 1925 and 1930, there were about 70 arrivals and departures daily; these had been cut to 48 by 1938.

The Court held that a strip club has no constitutional right to broadcast music into public streets in order to attract customers. The decision stated that location of the expression was a factor in considering if there was a violation. Background In 1996, the owner of a Montreal strip club on Ste‚ÄëCatherine Street was charged for violating a Montreal by-law which prohibited \\"noise produced by sound equipment\\". The owner challenged the charge on the grounds that the municipal law was a violation of his freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Charter. Both the Quebec Superior Court and the Quebec Court of Appeal agreed that the law violated the freedom of expression and could not be saved under section 1 of the Charter. The following issues were put to the Supreme Court: # Does the municipality have the power to enact the law? # Does the by-law Infringe Section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter? In a six to one decision the Court found that the by-law was valid, that it violated the freedom of expression, but was saved under section 1. Opinion of the Court Chief Justice McLachlin and Justice Deschamps wrote the decision for the majority. In their decision they examined the scope of the freedom of expression and added that the location of the expression was relevant to a finding of a violation. In the current situation, there was a violation. The violation was found to be justified under section 1. They held that the purpose of controlling noise pollution was a sufficiently important purpose and the means available were reasonable.

Privately constructed, it was inaugurated as the Teatro Nuovo to replace the smaller 800-seat \\"Cesareo Regio Teatro di San Pietro\\" on 21 April 1801 with a performance of Johann Simon Mayr's Ginevra di Scozia. Initially, the Nuovo had 1,400 seats. In 1821, it became known as the Teatro Grande. By the end of the 18th century, the need for a new theatre in Trieste became evident. Its main theatre, the Teatro di San Pietro, had become increasingly inadequate and closed in 1800. A proposal to the Austrian Chancery from Giovanni Matteo Tommasini to build a private theatre had existed since 1795 and, in June 1798, a contract was drawn up whereby annual funding would come from the municipality and Tommasini would hold the rights to several boxes and the rights to sell others. Gian Antonio Selva, the architect of the La Fenice in Venice, was engaged, and he designed a classic horseshoe-shaped auditorium. However, his exterior designs were considered to be too plain for the Austrians who then engaged another architect, Matteo Pertsch, to solve the problem, which was accomplished by incorporating elements of Milan's La Scala opera house. The \\"Nuovo\\" became a mixture of La Fenice on the inside and La Scala on the exterior. History Several name changes have occurred during the theatre's lifetime, the first in 1821 when it became the Teatro Grande \\"To distinguish it from those less illustrious\\", Lynn, p.82 and it was under this name that the theatre was the site of two Verdi opera premieres: Il corsaro in 1848 (featuring the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi, who Verdi married in 1859, in the leading role) and Stiffelio, a production which Verdi supervised - not without controversy - in 1850.\\"Leave the libretto as it is or I will withdraw the opera\\", Verdi, quoted in Lynn, p.85 However, before these premieres, Verdi's operas had begun to dominate the Teatro Grande's stage, followed, as the century progressed, by all the major works of the opera repertoire, including those by Puccini and Wagner. A further name change followed in 1861 due to a change from private to public ownership. Thus it became the Teatro Comunale and existed as such throughout the latter years of the 19th century. By 1881, seating capacity had been increased to 2,000 through the use of existing standing room spaces; but, by that December, the theatre was declared to be unsafe and it was closed for renovations, during which electricity replaced gas lighting for the reopening in 1889 with 1,000 seats. Within hours of his death in January 1901,Lynn, p.83 the theatre was once again renamed, this time to honour the memory of Giuseppe Verdi. It was extensively restored between 1992 and 1997 and re-opened with about 1,300 seats\\"il \\"Verdi\\" ha attualmente, a seguito dell‚Äôultima ristrutturazione, la capienza originale di circa 1300 posti\\", Theatre's website and with a Viva Verdi concert which included excerpts from many of the composer's operas.

History Washington Hebrew Congregation was formed on April 25, 1852, in Washington, D.C., by twenty-one members. Solomon Pribram was elected the first president. By 1854, there were forty-two members. On December 13, 1855, at the thirty-fourth session of the United States Congress, a special act was passed, which provided that The congregation grew steadily in membership and in influence; in 1863 it moved to the site of a former Methodist church, which had been used by the government as a hospital during the Civil War. From 1897 to 1954, the congregation met at 816 Eighth Street NW, in a building designed by Washington architects Louis F. Stutz and Frank W. Pease.Washington Hebrew Congregation Building Committee minutes, November 29, 1896, cited in Justin M. Spivey, \\"The Washington Hebrew Temple\\", typescript, Historical Society of Washington, D.C., 1997. The cornerstone of this building was laid on September 16, 1897, by President William McKinley. This building was sold to New Hope Baptist Church (later Greater New Hope Baptist Church) in March 1954.\\"Greater New Hope Baptist Climaxes 20th Anniversary,\\" Washington Afro-American, June 21, 1958. In 1952, President Harry S. Truman laid the cornerstone of the congregation's current home on Macomb Street NW, which was dedicated on May 6, 1955, by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. By 1905, the First Washington Hebrew Congregation was the only Reform congregation in the District of Columbia, with a membership of 350, and a religious school attended by 200 children. One prominent leader was Uriah P. Levy, the first Jewish Commodore of the United States Navy. Adas Israel Congregation, with Isaac Stampel as Hazzan, was founded in 1869 by 69 members of the Washington Hebrew Congregation who objected to the Reform tendencies of the old congregation. In the summer of 1966, a group of young Jewish activists urged the synagogue's rabbi, Rabbi Norman Gerstenfeld, to denounce a white Jewish landlord named Allie Freed for engaging in racist housing practices against African-Americans. After Rabbi Gerstenfeld refused to denounce Freed, Jewish members of ACCESS (Action Coordinating Committee to End Segregation in the Suburbs) leafleted the congregation during Yom Kippur in 1966 and 1967. They were condemned by Jason R. Silverman of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith for protesting on Yom Kippur. In light of this, Jewish activists founded Jews for Urban Justice in order to campaign against anti-black racism within white Jewish communities. Washington Hebrew Congregation is currently a member of the Union for Reform Judaism. It is one of the largest Reform congregations in the United States,\\"Expansive chuppah: Washington Hebrew OKs officiation of interfaith weddings - with conditions\\", Washington Jewish Week, September 6, 2006 (as of 2006, Washington Hebrew was 3rd largest Reform congregation). with 2,781 members reported on the Union for Reform Judaism database as of 2012.Congregational Profile of Stephen S. Wise Temple, Union for Reform Judaism (accessed February 13, 2012). Early Childhood Center Sex Abuse Allegations (2016-2018) In August 2018 the synagogue reported to community parents that it had learned of, and taken actions in response to, allegations that an employee at its Macomb Street Edlavitch-Tyser Early Childhood Center may have engaged in inappropriate conduct involving one or more children. According to a January 2020 report, the alleged victims were 14 or 15 children, ages two to four. The teacher who was accused of abuse (who is named in some news reports, not others) had been hired by the preschool in March 2016, and was placed on administrative leave in August 2016 and fired in October 2018. The D.C. Metropolitan Police and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia concluded a 16-month criminal investigation of the alleged abuser in January 2020, closing the case without filing any charges. A police statement explained that \\"after exhausting all investigative avenues, the universal determination of the investigative team was that there was insufficient probable cause to establish that an offense occurred or to make an arrest.\\" In contrast, the D.C. Office of the State Superintendent of Education stated, in a June 2019 cease-and desist letter to the congregation as reported by CNN, that it found that \\"more than one child was a victim of sexual abuse by the alleged maltreator.\\" The office determined that the preschool failed to ensure the safety of children under its care, failed to properly supervise children, and failed to comply with reporting requirements. The D.C. Attorney General's Office was also reportedly investigating the allegations. In April 2019, some parents of alleged victims filed a civil lawsuit against the congregation and Deborah ‚ÄúDJ‚Äù Schneider Jensen, head of school for early childhood education, alleging that they were negligent amid ‚Äúsystemic, regular sexual abuse.‚Äù Jensen was placed on administrative leave in April 2019, and subsequently left the center. According to a February 2020 report, that case was scheduled to go to trial in early 2021. Another group of parents filed a separate civil lawsuit in May 2019. Anti-Semitic graffiti In October 2019 the synagogue was vandalized with graffiti including, according to the police report, ‚Äúnumerous anti-Semitic statements, profane language, and child-like drawings of male and female genitalia.‚Äù This incident was one among several anti-Semitic hate crimes targeting that synagogue, as well as others in the region.

When Galton described the only known specimen, he referred it to the Kimmeridgian age (Late Jurassic) of the locality of Ribomar. However, to complicate matters, there are two localities nearby called Ribomar in the Estremadura region of Portugal. The first, near Mafra, is dated as Early Cretaceous, and the second, the Farta Pao Formation near Lourinh√£, as Late Jurassic. Antunes and Mateus (2003), considered the Late Jurassic age to be more likely. The type species was designated D. zbyszewskii, in honour of palaeontologist Georges Zbyszewski.  Material  The holotype of D. zbyszewsii is a partial skeleton that consists of a rib cage with thirteen dorsal vertebrae and five dermal scutes.  Systematics  Dracopelta was the first ankylosaur recognized from the Late Jurassic and remains one of the most primitive known genera referred to the Ankylosauria. Though originally placed within the Nodosauridae, Vickaryous et al. (2004) considered Dracopelta Ankylosauria incertae sedis.  Palaeobiology  It is difficult to estimate the animal's size from the fragmentary remains, but it was clearly a small dinosaur, approximately long. As an ankylosaur, it was almost certainly an herbivore.  See also  * Timeline of ankylosaur research  References   Further reading  * Antunes, M. T., and Mateus, O. 2003. Dinosaurs of Portugal.

A weeping tile (also called a drain tile or perimeter tileGradwell, John B., and Malcolm Welch. Technology--shaping our world. South Holland, Ill.: Goodheart-Willcox, 1991. 116. Print.) is a porous pipe used for underground water collection or discharge. Named in the time period when drainpipes were made from terracotta tiles, the modern material is typically a length of corrugated plastic pipe with small slits or weep holes in it, which is buried surrounded by aggregate larger than the slits. The aggregate rocks prevent excessive soil from falling through the slits into the weeping tile. With this arrangement, water in the surrounding soil above the weeping tile flows into the weeping tile. The weeping tile then drains into a solid pipe leading to a discharge or directly into a sump, where the water can be removed by a sump pump. Weeping tiles are often used for water drainage near basement foundations as a part of basement waterproofing, where they are called a French drain. They can be used in farmers' fields for the tile drainage of waterlogged fields. Such fields are called \\"tiled.\\" Weeping tiles can be used anywhere that soil needs to be drained. Weeping tile is used for the opposite reason in the septic drain fields for septic tanks. Clarified sewage from the septic tank is fed into weeping tiles buried shallowly in the drain field.

Spotting in weight or resistance training is the act of supporting another person during a particular exercise, with an emphasis on allowing the participant to lift or push more than they could normally do safely. Correct spotting involves knowing when to intervene and assist with a lift, and encouraging a training partner to push beyond the point in which they would normally 'rack' the weight (return it to its stationary position). Exercises Spotting is particularly prevalent when performing the bench press. Because of the risks of lifting a heavy weight in the supine position, a lifter will often ask for a spot unless he or she is completely confident that the lift will not be failed. While a spotter may prevent injury, a lifter may become too dependent on the spotter, and not realize the degree that the spotter is assisting them. This is sometimes jocularly referred to as the \\"two man bench press\\". Another exercise in which spotters are recommended is the barbell squat. Squats should be spotted by two spotters, one at each end of the bar. In the event of a missed lift, each spotter hooks an elbow under the end of the bar, and takes the plates in both hands. Care must be taken to keep the assistance balanced and coordinated to avoid uneven deloading of the weight and possible torsion injury. If two spotters are unavailable, a single spotter can assist by taking some of the weight off the bar allowing the lifter to return the weight to the rack. A single spotter is referred to as a 'Spinks'. Unlike other exercises this exercise does not present much of a chance for the spotters to assist the lifter, as the spotters only intercede in the event of a missed lift. Another exercise to utilize a spotter would be the triceps exercise Skull Crushers in which the lifter lowers an E-Z bar towards their head while lying flat on the bench. The spotter will be standing behind the individual and moving their hands approximately 6 inches below the bar so that they can catch it in the event of the lifter running out of energy. Additionally, some people prefer to have a spotter present during the barbell military press or barbell push press (two very similar exercises). This exercise involves lifting a considerable amount of weight about the head. During this exercise the spotter will assist in ‚Äúlifting off‚Äù the bar from the racked position. Then the spotter will keep his/her hands about 6 inches under the bar. This allows the spotter to assist when the lifter runs out of energy, but most importantly allows the spotter to catch the weight if the lifter cannot lift any more. A spotter may not be preferred, however, because the risk of injury is lower and it is easier to drop the weight on the ground if the lifter loses control of the barbell. Fashion Technology Many of the technology apps employed in the development of business legends services for use by spotters are private pay.

Trita Parsi was one of the founders and is the organization's former president. Jamal Abdi, formerly NIAC's Vice President for Policy and Executive Director for NIAC Action, took over as president on August 1, 2018. Background NIAC was founded in 2002 by Trita Parsi, Babak Talebi, and Farzin Illich to promote Iranian-American civic participation. NIAC advocates against war with Iran and advocated in support of the Iran nuclear deal. The Congressional publication, The Hill, cited NIAC's work in support of the Iran nuclear accord as one of the \\"Top lobbying victories of 2015.\\"  Sanctions  A NIAC report concluded that U.S. sanctions on Iran cost the U.S. economy between $135 billion and $175 billion in lost export revenue between 1995 and 2012. After the Iran nuclear deal was implemented and U.S. secondary sanctions on Iran were eased, the organization questioned the utility of the broad economic embargo the U.S. maintains on trade with Iran.  Lobbying for Iranian Students in the U.S.  NIAC has worked on behalf of Iranian students in the U.S. NIAC led the campaign to change the U.S.'s single-entry visa policy towards Iranian students, by allowing Iranian students to receive multiple entry visas, a measure that the Obama administration adopted in 2011.  Efforts to save ancient Persian artifacts  NIAC opposed efforts to confiscate ancient Persian artifacts from the University of Chicago, the Chicago Field Museum, Harvard University, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts as part of court cases filed against the Iranian government. From 2006-2018, NIAC fought against seizure of the Persepolis tablets in the media, the courts, the Congress, and the White House. This included supporting legislative amendments to prevent the seizure of ancient Persian artifacts, calling directly on the White House to intervene to protect the Persepolis tablets, and submitting an amicus brief on behalf of the Iranian-American community to the court to ensure that the community's heritage is protected. NIAC Action NIAC's sister 501(c)4 organization, NIAC Action, was formed in 2015 to support the nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran and to champion Iranian American priorities. At that time, NIAC Action assumed responsibility for and expanded direct and grassroots lobbying work previously conducted by NIAC. NIAC Action's expressed advocacy goals are \\"to strengthen U.S. diplomacy with Iran to advance peace and human rights, promote greater openings between the American and the Iranian people, protect civil rights and opportunities for Iranian Americans at home, and support candidates who represent the Iranian American community's values.\\" Jamal Abdi currently serves as the organization's Executive Director. Policy conference Since 2011, NIAC has held an annual Leadership Conference that \\"aims to expose its attendees to world-class leaders, and to teach Iranian Americans how to gain the political strength needed to effect real change on the issues.\\" The conference in 2015 included addresses from Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), as well as Representatives Donna Edwards (D-MD) and Dan Kildee (D-MI). Lobbying controversy and defamation lawsuit In 2007, Arizona-based Iranian-American journalist Hassan Daioleslam began publicly asserting that NIAC was lobbying on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In response, Parsi sued him for defamation. As a result of the lawsuit, many internal documents were released, which former Washington Times correspondent Eli Lake stated \\"raise questions\\" about whether the organization had violated U.S. lobbying regulations. Lake's article further mentions that ‚Äútwo lawyers who read some of the same documents said they did not provide enough evidence to conclude that Mr. Parsi was acting as a foreign agent.‚Äù NIAC responded that it is in \\"full compliance with all regulations and laws\\" and published all of its tax returns online to back up its claim. Andrew Sullivan responded to the story in The Atlantic, suggesting the motive of the story was to \\"smear\\" Parsi's reputation. In September 2012, U.S. Federal District Court Judge John D. Bates threw out the libel suit against Daioleslam on the grounds that \\"NIAC and Parsi had failed to show evidence of actual malice, either that Daioeslam acted with knowledge the allegations he made were false or with reckless disregard about their accuracy.\\" However, Judge Bates also noted that \\"nothing in this opinion should be construed as a finding that [Daioleslam's] articles were true. [Daioleslam] did not move for summary judgement on that ground.\\" On April 9, 2013, Judge Bates ordered NIAC to cover a portion of Daioleslam's legal expenses. Based on a 2015 Business Insider report, Judge John D. Bates rejected NIAC's lawsuit against Daioleslam, arguing that the NIAC president's work was \\"not inconsistent with the idea that he was first and foremost an advocate for the regime.\\" The judge came to the conclusion that it is reasonable to rationally assert that NIAC is lobbying on behalf of the Iranian government. A March 2015 column by Eli Lake in Bloomberg View asserted that the emails showed cooperation between Parsi and the then Iran ambassador to the United Nations and current Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. NIAC's webpage confirms ‚Äúthat Parsi developed a relationship with Zarif after interviewing him on ‚Äúnumerous occasions for his book.‚Äù It states that Parsi made introductions for members of the U.S. Congress to meet with Zarif at the request of the lawmakers. Funding According to NIAC, \\"over 10,000 individual donors make up the core of NIAC‚Äôs support and provide the overwhelming majority of our funding every year.\\" NIAC also receives funding from American philanthropic foundations such as the Ploughshares Fund and Rockefeller Brothers Fund. NIAC states that it does not receive funding from the U.S. or Iranian governments. Demonstration against NIAC In July 2019, some members of the Iranian community in the United States organized a demonstration in front of NIAC office in Washington DC. They believed NIAC is \\"the representative of the corrupt and brutal Islamic Republic regime\\" and not the voice of the Iranian-Americans. In response, a NIAC staff member appeared on BBC Persian and expressed support for free speech and described the protesters as supporters of the Donald Trump administration's policies toward Iran. Republican Senators Call to Investigate NIAC In January 2020, three Republican senators Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz and Mike Braun claimed that NIAC and its sister organization NIAC Action have violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and they are \\"amplifying regime propaganda in the United States\\". They requested the US Attorney-General William Barr to \\"evaluate whether an investigation of NIAC is warranted for potential FARA violations and to ensure transparency regarding foreign attempts to influence the US political process.\\" In response to the letter, dozens of academics, policy professionals, activists, former senior U.S. officials and non- governmental organizations signed a statement denouncing the Senators' letter and expressing solidarity with and support for NIAC. Recognized members Among its affiliated people, it is possible to mention Trita Parsi and Jamal Abdi whom served as the leader of the organization. Moreover several active reporters on Iranian topics including Negar Mortazavi are affiliated to this organization.NIAC Welcomes New Media and Communications Staff NIAC References External links  NIAC Action Website of NIAC's sister advocacy organization * tritaparsi.com Trita Parsi's website Category:Iranian- American culture in Washington, D.C.

This can be helpful in diagnosing sleep disorders. It was introduced in 1991 by Dr Murray Johns of Epworth Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The questionnaire The questionnaire asks the subject to rate his or her probability of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 to 3 for eight different situations that most people engage in during their daily lives, though not necessarily every day. The scores for the eight questions are added together to obtain a single number. A number in the 0‚Äì9 range is considered to be normal while a number in the 10‚Äì24 range indicates that expert medical advice should be sought. For instance, scores of 11‚Äì15 are shown to indicate the possibility of mild to moderate sleep apnea, where a score of 16 and above indicates the possibility of severe sleep apnea or narcolepsy. Certain questions in the scale were shown to be better predictors of specific sleep disorders, though further tests may be required to provide an accurate diagnosis. The questionnaire was originally created with the intent to preserve the exact wording of the questionnaire to provide a standardized test and to preserve its validity; the author of the ESS recommends that the administrator of the questionnaire does not discuss the results of the ESS with the subject until it is completed, as this may affect the subject's responses on the questionnaire. An interactive calculator is available that utilizes the 1997 version of the ESS. It automatically provides the score based on the responses to the ESS questions: ESS interactive calculator.The Epworth Sleepiness Scale: About the ESS Calibration The Epworth Sleepiness Scale has been validated primarily in obstructive sleep apnea, though it has also shown success in detecting narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. It is used to measure excessive daytime sleepiness and is repeated after the administration of treatment (e.g., CPAP) to document improvement of symptoms. In narcolepsy, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale has both a high specificity (100%) and sensitivity (93.5%). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale has been used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of other similar measurements of sleep quality. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a related scoring tool of sleep quality. Both scores are internally highly reproducible.

The spotter stands below the climber, with arms raised or at the ready. If the climber falls, the spotter does not catch the climber, but redirects the climber's fall so that they land safely on a bouldering mat. At the very least the spotter ensures that the climber's head and back do not strike the ground directly. If the climber jumps down, the spotter can also help prevent stumbles and injuries on uneven ground. The spotter should stand with their fingers together (known as \\"using spoons\\") to avoid broken fingers. A spotter should always be used for accident prevention. A climbing spotter will typically hold their arms up with hands in a supporting position for more or less vertical climbs. When the climber falls, the spotter's hands lightly hold the climber's hips or lower back, near the climber's center of gravity. This allows the spotter to help guide the climber's fall effectively, helping them keep their center of gravity over their feet. When on steeper, past vertical climbs, the spotter will hold their arms out in a cradling position. If the climber falls, the spotter supports the upper and middle back, helping the climber land on their feet.Sherman, John, \\"Spotting\\" in Better Bouldering (Globe Pequot Press, 1997), pp. 19‚Äì23. A spotter may also be used to help accomplish new climbing moves. Often much of the energy in learning a new move is exerted in simply holding onto the rock. If a spotter puts even the slightest pressure on the climber's upper back or upward pressure on the hips during a move they will often give the climber the extra relief needed to learn the move. Once the move is learned, it can usually be practised and mastered without the extra help. The term spotting originated in 1930, when a new gymnastics coach at the University of Illinois, Hartley Price, painted diameter white circles on the gymnasium walls, calling them \\"spots\\". Seeing the \\"spots\\", gymnasts were supposed to think safety and look for those who could assist them through one element or another.

Lapta () is a Russian bat and ball game first known to be played in the 14th century. Mentions of lapta have been found in medieval manuscripts, and balls and bats were found in the 14th-century layers during excavations in Novgorod. It is similar to cricket, br√§nnboll, Rounders, baseball, oinƒÉ, :it:Tsan (Italy) and pes√§pallo. Rules The game is played outside on a field the size of half a football pitch 20 x 25 sazhens ( x ). There are 5 people on the field from the defending team, as well as pitcher/server. This pitcher server stands near the batter of the opposing team and hits a ball in the direction of the batter. The team that bats contains six people. Each hitter gets 2 chances to hit the ball over a 10m line. If they succeed at that, the runners can go to an endline at the other end of the pitch. If a player manages to run between the two endpoints, they get 2 points. A game lasts an hour, split into two equal halves. The edges of the field were marked with parallel lines, called salo. The goal of the game is to hit the ball, served by a player of the opposite team, with the bat and send the ball as far as possible, then run across the field to the kon line, and if possible to run back to the gorod line. The running player should try to avoid being hit with the ball, which is thrown by the opposing team members. For successful runs, the team earns points. A team wins by either getting more points during the scheduled time or by having all its players complete runs. A description of lapta is given by Aleksandr Kuprin: > This folk game is one of the most interesting and useful games. Lapta > requires resourcefulness, deep breathing, faithfulness to your group, > attention, dexterity, fast running, good aiming and marksmanship, strong > striking hands, and firm eternal confidence that you cannot be defeated.

Career Gould played lead for Stoughton in two stints from 1995‚Äì97 and 2003 to March 2012. Between those times he also played lead for Vic Peters, Dale Duguid, Barry Fry and also an alternate stint for Stoughton in 1999.CurlingZone List of Steve Gould teams With Stoughton, he won three Briers (1996, 1999, and 2011) a World Curling Championship in both 1996 and 2011, as well as a silver medal in 1999. He has also won six provincial championships with Stoughton. He is the only two-time winner (1999 and 2006) of the annual Ford Hot Shots skills and shot-making competition that precedes the start of play at the Brier. Gould left the Stoughton rink in 2012, and did not play in competitive curling for the 2012-13 curling season except for the 2013 The Dominion All-Star Curling Skins Game. Fans voted Gould to play in the event, and he was selected to play lead with Carter Rycroft, John Morris and skip Glenn Howard. The team won the event, defeating the team skipped by Kevin Koe. During the event, Gould announced he would be retiring from curling. Gould is nicknamed the \\"Tick Man\\" for being one of the first curlers to popularize the \\"tick shot\\" in curling. The defensive shot is usually only used by leads, and it involves moving opposing guards to the side of the sheet, without removing them, which would be a violation of the free guard rule.

Background The respondent M was an immigration consultant carrying on his work through an immigration consulting company (\\"Westcoast\\"). He had not studied law in Canada and was not a member of the B.C. Law Society. M and other Westcoast employees engaged in a number of activities involving immigration proceedings, including appearing as counsel or advocate on behalf of aliens, for or in the expectation of a fee from the persons for whom the acts were performed, before the Immigration and Refugee Board (\\"IRB\\"). The Law Society brought an application seeking a permanent injunction against M and Westcoast to prevent them from engaging in the ongoing practice of law, in contravention of the B.C. Legal Profession Act. M and Westcoast admitted that they were engaged in the practice of law within the meaning of s. 1 of the Legal Profession Act, but contended that their conduct was sanctioned by ss. 30 and 69(1) of the Immigration Act, which permit non-lawyers to appear on behalf of clients before the IRB. The judge issued the injunction on the grounds that ss. 30 and 69(1) of the Immigration Act did not authorize the practice of law. Alternatively, she would have granted the injunction on the basis that the provisions were ultra vires Parliament. The Court of Appeal set aside the injunction. The central issues raised by this appeal are whether ss. 30 and 69(1) of the Immigration Act are intra vires Parliament, and whether s. 26 of the Legal Profession Act, which prohibits a person, other than a member of the Law Society in good standing or a person listed in the exceptions, to engage in the practice of law, is constitutionally inoperative to persons acting under ss. 30 and 69(1) of the Immigration Act and its associated Rules and Regulations. In this Court, the respondent S was added to the proceedings on the basis that she is an immigration consultant and was engaged in the same activities as M, given that M became a member of the Alberta Law Society soon after leave to appeal was granted by this Court. Opinion of the Court Justice Gonthier wrote the opinion for a unanimous court. He held that the sections of the Immigration Act was a valid subject matter of the federal government, and that M was allowed to practice law in front of the Board under the provisions of the Immigration Act. Given the clear overlap of laws, Gonthier considered whether to apply the paramountcy doctrine or the inter-jurisdictional immunity doctrine to resolve the conflict. He found that the paramountcy doctrine was more appropriate as there was a clear double aspect in the law.para. 52 The first part of the paramountcy test asks whether there is an operational conflict where the provincial law frustrates the purpose of the federal law. Gonthier found that the purpose of the federal law was to authorize non- lawyers to appear as counsel in immigration tribunals for a fee, but the provincial law made exercise of the authority impossible. Consequently, the paramountcy doctrine can be invoked and the provincial law was held to be inoperative to the extent of the conflict.

He was the team captain and leading tackler of the Buccaneers' early teams, coached by John McKay. High school career Wood played high school football for Thomas Jefferson High School in Elizabeth, New Jersey. College career Wood attended the University of Southern California as a student and football player. There he was a three- time All-American for the University of Southern California Trojans during the 1972-74 seasons. The Trojans football team won two National Championships during Wood's years there. He was a modest-sized player for an NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly NCAA Division I-A) linebacker, but made up for his lack of size with lightning speed, stamina, and hard-hitting tackles. His trademark Batman \\"band of black\\" painted across his nose and around both eyes, as those eyes peered out from his helmet, was celebrated by his teammates, the sports press, and Trojan football fans, and they were a gesture to intimidate opponent's linemen and running backs. Wood came to the varsity as a sophomore in 1972, and he not only led the undefeated Trojans in tackles, but also surpassed the total of his closest teammate by 30 tackles. He was given the responsibility of calling his team's defensive signals. Wood had five interceptions, returning one for a touchdown and he deflected four other passes. For his efforts, he gained first-team All-American honors. In his junior year he once again led U.S.C. to a conference title and another trip to the Rose Bowl Game. He was a consensus All-American in 1973. In 1974, Wood was part of his second victorious Rose Bowl team and national championship team. He repeated as a consensus All-American honoree. While at U.S.C. the Trojans had a 31-3-2 won-loss-tied record. In 2007, Wood was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Professional career Wood was selected by the New York Jets in the third round of the 1975 NFL Draft, but experienced a difficult rookie season. He also had trouble fitting into a Jets locker room atmosphere that he considered to be cold and unfriendly.

He appeared in Major League Baseball, largely as a relief pitcher, over ten seasons (1935‚Äì43; 1946) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Brooklyn Dodgers, and Boston Red Sox. Brown posted a 76‚Äì57 record with a 3.46 ERA and 44 saves in 387 appearances (55 as a starter). Playing career Brown was also a javelin thrower who attended the University of Iowa on a track scholarship. He started his professional baseball career after college. In 1934, he won 19 games for the Tulsa Oilers of the Texas League and was purchased by the Pirates in November. Brown became known as one of the first full-time relief specialists in the Major Leagues. In 1938, he led the Pirates with 15 wins (all in relief), led the National League with 51 games pitched, and became the first reliever to play the All-Star Game. In 1943, with the Red Sox, he also led the American League in games pitched with 49. However, Brown is also known for giving up the Homer in the Gloamin', the home run that cost the Pirates their lead in the 1938 National League pennant race. On September 28, 1938, the Pirates were playing the Chicago Cubs, who trailed the Pirates by just one-half game in the league standings. Brown entered the game with the teams tied 5‚Äì5 in the bottom of the ninth inning. Darkness was falling fast, and the Cubs' Wrigley Field had no lights, meaning the game could end in a tie. But Gabby Hartnett soon smacked a pitch from Brown over the left-center field wall, giving the Cubs the victory and propelling them into first place. The Pirates proceeded to lose four of their final five games, securing the Cubs' hold on the pennant. Brown missed the 1944 and 1945 seasons while serving as Lieutenant junior grade in the United States Navy during World War II. Scout and coach Following his playing career, Brown served as a coach and North Carolina-based scout for the Red Sox organization from 1947 through 1989. He was the Major League pitching coach for the 1965 Red Sox, serving on the staff of manager Billy Herman, who was the Cubs' starting second baseman in the \\"Homer in the Gloamin'\\" game. As a spring training coach for the Red Sox, Brown worked with both pitchers and catchers. Among the latter was Carlton Fisk who credited Mace with teaching him technical and leadership skills that stayed with him throughout his career. Brown died in Greensboro, North Carolina, at the age of 92.

Benedictine abbey It was founded in the early 12th century, shortly after the foundation of Garsten Abbey, by the local nobleman, Arnhalm I of Glunich, who gave his castle for conversion to a monastery. The premises, dedicated to Saint Andrew, were ready for occupation in the 1120s. Gleink was settled from Garsten Abbey, from where the first abbot, Ulrich, came. The family of the original founder, after running short of money, were obliged to pass the position of Vogt (lord protector) to Leopold the Strong, Margrave of Styria, who also issued the foundation charter in 1125 and endowed the abbey with property, notably around the present Gleinkersee. The abbey suffered fire damage in 1220, 1275 and 1313, but narrowly escaped destruction at the hands of the invading Hungarians in the late 15th century and the marauding Turks in 1532, although they caused devastation in the surrounding area. Later in the 16th century the Reformation and the spread of Lutheranism caused more difficulties, a trend which only began to reverse from 1575 with the appointment of Abbot Georg Andreas (1575-1585) from Niederaltaich Abbey. The abbey also suffered damage during the Thirty Years' War. From the later 17th century however more favourable circumstances allowed the development and refurbishment of the premises in the Baroque style, principally associated at Gleink with Abbot Rupert II Freysauf von Neudegg (1709-1735). Abbot Wolfgang Hofmayr, well known as a preacher and a professor in the University of Salzburg, took office in 1762. He was the last abbot: the monastery was dissolved under Joseph II on 21 May 1784. From 1625 until its dissolution the abbey was a member of the Benedictine Austrian Congregation. Library The continuing difficulties faced by the abbey were reflected in the depleted state of its library, which in 1599 contained only 110 printed books and 150 manuscripts. However, in the relative prosperity of the period from the mid-17th century onwards, the library grew, acquiring among other things the manuscript of the Gleinker Weltchronik (see below). At the dissolution, the library contents were divided between the Studienbibliothek (now the Linz University Library) and the Linz Diocesan Library. Gleinker Weltchronik Perhaps the best-known item from the former abbey library is the illuminated manuscript known as the Gleinker Weltchronik, a history of the world based on the Bible. Produced in the mid-14th century, it contains an inscription placing it at Gleink in 1712. This manuscript is now Codex 472 of the Linz University Library . Convent of the Salesian Sisters After a short period of use as a barracks, the buildings were given to the Bishop of Linz as a summer residence. In 1832, at the invitation of the then bishop, a community of Salesian Sisters from Vienna took up residence. No new novices entered the community however after about 1950, and the convent was eventually closed in 1977. Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus Since the dissolution the parochial duties had been carried out by parish priests, but from 1950 were undertaken by the Missionary Order of the Heart of Jesus, who settled and run a boys' home here ever since. Steyr-Gleink Stiftsmuseum The premises today also accommodate a museum of religious objects, ecclesiastical embroidery and so on. The Dwarves of Gleink Among the curiosities of the abbey was a set of Baroque stone dwarves, or garden gnomes, of the 18th century. They were removed in the 1970s to Schloss Lamberg in Steyr. Similar sets of the same period are to be found in Lambach Abbey, among other places.

He was also known as a member of instrumental group The Tornados. Life Heinz was born in Detmold, (Germany), but from the age of seven was brought up in Eastleigh, Hampshire, England. His German father had been killed during World War II and his mother decided to move to Britain. Heinz was influenced by the US singer Eddie Cochran and played in a local Eastleigh group, the Falcons, in the 1950s. Working in a Southampton grocery shop Heinz came to the attention of record producer Joe Meek, becoming his prot√©g√©. Meek styled Heinz's image, which included persuading him to peroxide his hair. Heinz was a member of the Tornados, famous for their multi-million selling hit \\"Telstar\\". With Meek in love with Heinz, he struggled to launch him on a solo career. Due to the inadequacies of Heinz's voice, his vocals on his first single \\"Dreams Do Come True\\" were over-dubbed by another singer, a Meek artist named Mark Douglas or Billy Gray, but whose real name was William Halsey. The single was a commercial failure. With Meek vigorously promoting Heinz, he was sent on a tour with Gene Vincent and Jerry Lee Lewis. Audiences did not take to him, and he was attacked on stage and had beans thrown over him (to a contemporary audience 'Heinz' would have been associated with Heinz Baked Beans). Heinz's next and biggest-selling solo hit was \\"Just Like Eddie\\", a tribute to Eddie Cochran. Its success coincided with the emergence of The Beatles and was the high point of commercial success for Heinz. Two successful EPs, Heinz and Live It Up, followed, and 1963 he appeared in the British music-film Live It Up!, with music produced by Meek, in which he acted the role of Ron and also contributed a song. Following a well-received tour with Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas and Bobby Rydell, Heinz was seen as belonging to an era of rock and roll as the more modern Merseybeat became more popular. He covered the Bob Dylan song \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\\", which was another commercial failure. A move from the Decca label to EMI saw him gain a minor hit with \\"Diggin' My Potatoes\\". Differences of a professional and personal level with Meek appeared, and with Heinz introducing his girlfriend to Meek their relationship faltered. Although he had lived briefly in Meek's flat, further disagreements over royalties saw him move out, leaving some possessions behind including a shotgun. It was this shotgun with which Meek killed his landlady and then himself in 1967, and although Heinz was questioned by police, they concluded he had nothing to do with their deaths. Meek's death ended Heinz's recording career as a solo artist, and he worked outside the music industry including in advertising at a local newspaper, The Dagenham Post. Although often dismissed as a mediocre talent pushed into the spotlight by Meek, Heinz was an enthusiastic performer, and worked in pantomime and theatre in the 1970s, including a role in David Hare's Teeth 'n' Smiles in 1976, as a dim- witted would-be rock star. In later years, he appeared in 1960s revival shows and continued performing until the end; his last set was from a wheelchair at a social club two weeks before his death. Backing groups He was initially backed by the Saints: Roy Phillips, guitar, Tab Martin, bass and Ricky Winter, drums. His later backing groups (the Wild Ones or the Wild Boys) featured Ritchie Blackmore and others. Mick Underwood, Chas Hodges, Blackmore, and Ken Lundgren performed on \\"Just Like Eddie\\" as members of the Outlaws. Heinz performed at the London Rock and Roll Show in 1972, with John B. Sparks and Wilko Johnson of Dr Feelgood in his backing band, as shown in the documentary Oil City Confidential. Sexuality He was portrayed by JJ Feild in Telstar, a film about the life of Joe Meek, which was released in 2009. The film depicts him as Meek's gay lover at a time when homosexual acts were illegal in the United Kingdom. His family have denied that he was homosexual and have stated that the film is a slur on his life. His former wife, Della Burke, who was married to Heinz at the height of his success said \\"It is completely and utterly untrue. Heinz was definitely heterosexual.\\" In the 1991 BBC documentary \\"The Very Strange Story of... the Legendary Joe Meek\\", when asked if Meek was in love with him, Heinz replied \\"Yes. It's an infatuation ... that was the thing with him, where I told him to get off, that I wasn't into that sort of thing ... if there's something you can't have you want it even more\\".\\"\\"Arena\\" The Very Strange Story of... The Legendary Joe Meek (1991)\\", IMDb. Retrieved 26 May 2017. Death Crippled by motor neurone disease, Heinz died in 2000, aged 57 following a stroke.

In this event, between 1975 and 1988 he won five world titles and three Olympic silver medals, in 1976, 1984 and 1988; he missed the 1980 Games because of their boycott by West Germany. His career is known for the rivalry with Pertti Karppinen that stretched for 14 years. Biography At the 1974 World Rowing Championships in Lucerne, Kolbe won bronze with the coxed four. In 1975, he won his first World Rowing Championship in the single scull. He was named German Sportsman of the year for this achievement. He went into the 1976 Olympics as the favorite. On the day of the Olympic finals, the wind was fierce and the course difficult. Kolbe led the entire race only to be passed in the closing moments by Karppinen who had trailed badly during the early portions of the race. Kolbe's reward was a silver medal. Germany boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. Kolbe left the single scull and rowed in the German national eight (8+), which raced in several European events. His rival Karppinen won the gold medal at the Olympics. At the 1984 Olympics, Kolbe faced his rival Karppinen once again. Kolbe fought for and got the lead early in the race. He slowly began pulling away from the other rowers. Karppinen languished far back. Over the last thousand meters of the race, Kolbe continued to pull away from the pack, but Karppinen was inching his way back into the race. In the last 150 meters of the race, Karppinen caught an exhausted Kolbe and went on to win his third gold medal. In both the 1976 and 1984 Olympics, Karppinen and Kolbe separated themselves from the pack turning a multi-boat race into a two boat match. They were the two best scullers in the world. They raced each other many other times and their races were well rowed and hard fought. Unlike the Olympics, Kolbe, more often than not, beat his rival at the World Championships. At the 1988 Olympics, Kolbe finally beat Karppinen at the Olympics, but there was a new sculling sensation. Thomas Lange won the race with Kolbe again getting silver, and Karppinen not even making the finals. Kolbe was consistently fast. In all Kolbe's Olympic and World Championship races, only Karppinen, Lange and Andrew Sudduth were ever able to beat Kolbe in a regularly rigged boat. In 1982, Kolbe moved to Oslo to be with his Norwegian wife, a journalist whom he met at the 1975 World Championships. He later returned to Germany and in 1994 became director of the German Rowing Federation. In July 2016, Kolbe was inducted into Germany's Sports Hall of Fame.

Parkmerced is the second-largest single-owner neighborhood of apartment blocks west of the Mississippi River after Park La Brea in Los Angeles. It was a planned neighborhood of high-rise apartment towers and low-rise garden apartments in southwestern San Francisco for middle-income tenants. It contains 3,221 residences (after sale of five blocks to San Francisco State University (SFSU)) and over 9,000 residents, and is one of four remaining privately owned large-scale garden apartment complexes in the United States. The complex is located south of SFSU, west of 19th Avenue, and east of Lake Merced and the Harding Park Golf Club. The far western boundary of the neighborhood extends to Lake Merced Boulevard, and the neighborhood is popular with students and faculty at San Francisco State University because of its proximity. The property was purchased in October 2005 for approximately $687,000,000 by a joint venture between Stellar Management and Rockpoint Group from a JP Morgan Chase and Carmel Partners joint venture entity. One of Parkmerced's numerous unique courtyards Parkmerced also has several high-rise apartment towers. Aerial view of several Parkmerced high-rise apartment buildings, showing their distinctive shape The Parkmerced Common, bounded by Juan Bautista Circle Design and history The apartment towers were designed by Leonard Schultze and Associates, the post- War successor firm to Schultze and Weaver, in partnership with prominent landscape architect Thomas Dolliver Church. The development was built by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, after their success with the Parkchester development in New York City. Development started in the 1939, but was slowed due to World War II. The first tenants moved into the Font Boulevard buildings in early 1944. The development was completed in the early 1950s and was a first home to many military families returning from the Second World War and the Korean War. Metropolitan Life has built similar apartment blocks in other large cities, including Park La Brea in Los Angeles, Parkfairfax in Virginia, and Riverton Houses, Parkchester, and Stuyvesant Town‚ÄîPeter Cooper Village in Manhattan to name a few. Parkmerced‚Äôs unusual pie-shaped blocks were designed by its architect, Leonard Schultze, and shares many features with his Park La Brea design. Schultze worked closely with landscape architect Thomas Dolliver Church, who often collaborated with cutting-edge, Modern architects, to refine the plan for Parkmerced. Church developed a unifying concept for the landscaping of each individually designed and graded garden courtyard, the different street types, open spaces such as Robert Pender Park in Juan Bautista Circle [dedicated May 3, 2009], the Meadow and the recreation area, aided by office intern Robert Royston. Metlife owned and carefully maintained the property until early 1970s, when it sold it to Leona Helmsley and the property began to deteriorate. There were a succession of owners and management companies beginning in the late 1990s. The commercial areas of the development were sold off to investors, and other parts sold to the California State University system for San Francisco State University. As of 2008, 116 of the original are owned and maintained by a single investor, who purchased the property for $687 million and has committed $110 million in upgrades. During the early 2000s (decade) the property was marketed as The Villas Parkmerced, however, as of 2009, signage and advertisements have returned to the original Parkmerced name. Transportation Bus service through Parkmerced primarily is provided by the San Francisco Municipal Railway 57 Parkmerced route. Additionally, the 18, 28, 28R and 29 bus routes, as well as the Muni Metro M Ocean View light-rail line, operate along nearby 19th Avenue, and 18 46th Avenue bus line runs on Lake Merced Boulevard. Ongoing construction and development plans Parkmerced is in the middle of reconstruction. Current projects include replacing old elevators, remodeling entrances to the towers, applying wooden window frames and miscellaneous detailing to the garden townhomes, modifying landscaping, providing new mailbox units, as well as painting the outsides of all the buildings through 2009. Parkmerced acquired their own Saturday morning Farmer's Market, which takes place on the western meadow of the neighborhood. As of at least August 15, 2011, this farmer's market has moved to Serramonte Center in Daly City. Along with aesthetic changes being made to the public spaces in the neighborhood, vacant garden and tower apartments are also seeing heavy renovations. These include new stainless steel appliances, granite marble counter tops, laminate flooring, and wooden cabinets. An emphasis by the development team is on the sustainability. The owners and managers of the various parts of Parkmerced recently proposed a major redevelopment, which would involve phased demolishing of the deteriorating garden apartments in favor of higher density replacements, and reconfiguring some streets. In May 2011, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted 6-5 to approve this redevelopment plan, including the replacement of virtually all of the low-rise garden apartment units with new mid-rise structures. In addition, the plan calls for preserving the rent- controlled status of tenants who are relocated, and it also involves construction of several hundred new units, some of which will be rentals, while others will be made available for sale. Plans also calls for retail, grocery store, performance center, and the re-routing of the M Oceanview metro line into Parkmerced. The updated plan for Parkmerced is developed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Modern Luxury Magazine Criticism The complex was the subject of significant controversy over the policies of a previous owner regarding rent control and deceptive pricing. Apartments were alleged to have been offered at low prices because of a significant discount offered at lease signing. Upon expiration of the initial lease, rents could be raised by the maximum percentage allowed under San Francisco rent control laws, but calculating from the initial, not discounted, rent, leading in some cases to rental increases of 28%. The complex was sued in a class action lawsuit that was settled out of court. The current owners Parkmerced Investors, LLC, were not sued over this issue.

It was erected by Edward I in 1277, following the First Welsh War. Much of the work was overseen by master mason James of Saint George. Rhuddlan, which was not completed until 1282, was built concurrently with Flint Castle, at a time when King Edward I of England was consolidating his conquest of Wales. It was temporarily his residence, and his daughter, Elizabeth, is presumed to have been born there. Construction Rhuddlan was planned as a concentric castle. It has a unique 'diamond' in layout as the gatehouses are positioned at the corners of the square baileys instead of along the sides like at Flint, Harlech or Beaumaris. Records of construction costs show that it was the major piece of building work being carried out by the English during the late 1270s. The inner ward has defensive walls with twin-tower gatehouses. The outer ward is surrounded by a curtain wall that has small towers and turrets. According to Thomas Pennant, who passed through the town on his travels in the 18th century, one of the towers is named \\"Twr-y-Silod\\" (\\"Grain Tower\\"), and another \\"Twr-y-Brenin\\" (\\"The King's Tower\\")The castle had a three-sided moat, with the River Clwyd protecting its fourth side. Within the inner ward there was a great hall, kitchens, private apartments and a chapel. The outer bailey had a granary, stables and a smithy. Rhuddlan is next to the River Clwyd. During the fortification's lengthy construction, the river course was straightened and dredged to allow ships to sail inland along a man-made channel. Its purpose was to allow provisions and troops to reach the castle even if hostile forces or a siege prevented overland travel. A further protective earthwork and timber structure was created around it in 1280-82. The castle was completed prior to the rebellion of Llywelyn the Last in 1282. History One of the two gatehouses to the inner ward, with the walls of the outer ward running off to the left The castle from the north The story of Rhuddlan goes back much further than the fortress built by Edward I. Prior to the Norman occupation of lower Gwynedd, Rhuddlan was at the heart of a Welsh cantref. From here the Lords of Rhuddlan commanded the Perfeddwlad (lands of north east Wales) on behalf of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (1007 ‚Äì 5 August 1063), the last ruler of all Wales. The town itself, however, began as a Saxon \\"burgh\\" founded by Edward the Elder. In the late 11th century, the Normans invaded Gwynedd. Rhuddlan's strategic position ensured that it was fought over by the Princes of Gwynedd and the Earls of Chester, with Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, who had been driven out by Harold Godwinson, re-taking the town. The remains of a Norman castle at Twthill, built in 1086, is just to the south of the current castle; it was built by Robert of Rhuddlan, a supporter of King William I of England. In July 1277, at the outbreak of the Welsh Wars, Edward I left Chester and established an advance base at Flint, where building work immediately began on Flint Castle. With naval assistance from 25 ships of the Cinque Ports fleet, the army pushed along the coast. By August Edward had moved his forces on to Rhuddlan, which, as was his custom, he was able to supply by river. Three months later the town was ceded to the English Crown following the Treaty of Aberconwy between Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Edward I. Work on Rhuddlan Castle began immediately under the control of Master Bertram, a Gascon engineer, but construction was soon handed over to Savoyard master mason, James of St George who remained in charge until labour ceased in 1282. Besieged by the Welsh during the rebellion of 1282, until relieved by an English force led by future Amadeus V, Count of Savoy. Edward I also created a new borough, north of his castle, away from the pre-existing Norman town and Dominican Friary. The 13th- century street layout can still be seen in the modern town. The borough, like at Flint, was defended with a pair of ditch-separated earthworks and a timber palisade. The overgrown ruins of Rhuddlan Castle in the mid 19th-century Elizabeth, the eighth daughter of Edward I, was born at Rhuddlan in 1282, the same year work at the castle was completed. Two years later the Statute of Rhuddlan was signed at the castle following the defeat of Llewellyn the Last, who had attacked the castle unsuccessfully. It ceded all the lands of the former Welsh Princes to the English Crown and introduced English common law. Edward I could now appoint Royal officials such as sheriffs, constables, and bailiffs to collect taxes and enforce English law throughout Wales. Following Rhuddlan, the counties of north western North Wales were placed under the control of the Justiciar of North Wales. Although the statute brought in English legislation, Welsh law continued to be practised at local level after the conquest of the Wales. This remained the case until 1536 when Rhuddlan's statute was repealed by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542 that made English common law the exclusive judicial system in Wales. In 1294 the castle was attacked during the Welsh rising of Madog ap Llywelyn but was not taken. It remained in English hands and was one of the places where King Richard II of England stopped in 1399 on his way to Flint, where he would be taken prisoner by his rival, Henry IV. It was attacked again in the following year by forces of Owain Glynd≈µr in 1400. This time the town was badly damaged but the castle held out. In the latter 15th and early 16th centuries the castle's condition deteriorated as its strategic and administrative importance waned. Rhuddlan Castle was again garrisoned by Royalist troops during the English Civil War, and remained a stronghold of King Charles I of England until well after the Battle of Naseby, being taken by Parliamentary forces under Thomas Mytton after a siege in 1646. Two years later, Parliamentarians partially demolished the castle to prevent any further military use. By the time Pennant passed through in 1781, it was largely ruined. Present day Today Rhuddlan Castle is managed by Cadw, a Welsh-government body with the mission to protect, conserve and promote the building heritage of Wales.

The kegs themselves were made by Colonel Joseph Borden's cooperage to the specifications of Caleb Carman and designed by David Bushnell, an inventor and graduate of Yale College. They were filled with gunpowder and released to float down the Delaware River. It was hoped that they would contact British warships along the riverfront and explode as river mines. As the floating mines moved downriver, however, few of them contacted the ships of the British navy. The British had hauled their ships into positions that protected them from floating river ice, and as a result of this precaution the ships also avoided the exploding kegs. The operation did not achieve strategic results, and the British fleet was little damaged. The only casualties were two curious young boys who were killed by a mine/keg. and alerting the British. The attack was ineffectual. Bushnell mines destroying a small British boat from Cerberus Earlier in 1777 a floating mine/keg sank a small British barge/tender to , killing four sailors and wounding an unknown number. The sudden explosion alerted the British to the point that soldiers flocked the wharves and were ordered to shoot at any piece of wood in the water. The ensuing emotional scene on the Philadelphia riverfront forms the basis of the ballad, which sarcastically praises the \\"courage\\" of the British occupation force. The ballad was meant to signal the indefatigable nature of the American rebel army, which had been driven out of Philadelphia and at the time of this operation was encamped under miserable conditions at Valley Forge. By creating a defiant song, the Americans hoped to signal that they did not propose to give up. Further reading *Swanson, June.

Since 1851, the former monastery buildings have accommodated a prison. History The abbey was founded in 1080-82 by Ottokar II of Styria as a community of secular canons and as a dynastic burial place for his family. Together with his fortress, the Styraburg (Schloss Lemberg), it served as a focal point of Ottokar as ruler of the Traungau, and was endowed with significant possessions in the Traisen and G√∂lsen valleys, in Lower Austria, probably from the dowry of Ottokar's wife Elisabeth, daughter of the Babenberger Leopold II of Austria. In 1107-08 the monastery was given as a priory to the Benedictine G√∂ttweig Abbey, and became an independent abbey in 1110-11. Its first and greatest abbot was Blessed Berthold of Garsten (d. 1142), a champion of the Hirsau Reforms, who is buried in the abbey church, and who built the abbey up to such a level that for centuries it was the religious, spiritual and cultural centre of the Eisenwurzen region. From 1625 Garsten Abbey was a member of the Benedictine Austrian Congregation. In 1787 it was dissolved by Emperor Joseph II. Prison Since 1851 the former monastery buildings have accommodated a prison, Justizanstalt Garsten. This is one of the few prisons in Austria where life sentences are carried out. Austrian incest-rapist Josef Fritzl is serving his sentence there. Abbey Church Garsten Abbey Church - interior The abbey church still survives as a parish church. It was built by the Carlone family of master builders and is considered one of the most beautiful examples of High Baroque architecture in Austria. Particularly notable are the stucco work and the Dutch tapestries. The Losenstein chapel, the sacristy and the summer choir are also of special interest.

The song tackles the subject of abortion with lyrics described as \\"some of the most uncompromising, gut-wrenching lyrics imaginable\\". Lyrical content The lyrics contain very graphic imagery about a terminated foetus and feature a great deal of profanity for the time: the third and final verse begins with a couplet in which the word fuck is repeated five times in rapid succession. The song is mostly about a fan named Pauline, who was (as the song states) from Birmingham. She had been in a mental institution, where she apparently lived in a tree house in its garden. This was where the line 'Her name was Pauline, she lived in a tree' comes from. The institution was also where she seems to have been raped by one of the male nurses. When she was released, she travelled to London, where she became a punk rock fan. She had several abortions. According to legend, she showed up once at John Lydon's door wearing nothing but a clear plastic bag and holding an aborted foetus in a clear plastic bag. In a 1977 interview, when asked about the backstory of the song, Lydon also claimed that she was arrested after entering a discotheque with the aborted foetus. According to Lydon's autobiography, she told Lydon about becoming pregnant and then having abortions and she described them in detail to him. This affected Lydon enough to write the song. Most of the band also had experiences with Pauline, but have spoken less about it. Reception With its repeated mentions of \\"I'm not an animal,\\" of \\"Mummy,\\" and of a dying baby, the song has been interpreted as anti-abortion, music critic Robert Christgau contemporarily calling it \\"effectively anti-abortion, anti-woman, and anti-sex.\\" In 2006, National Review magazine put the song at #8 on its list of the \\"50 Greatest Conservative Rock songs\\", due to its negative and unflinching description of abortion. Lydon himself, in a 2007 interview with Spin Magazine, said \\"I don't think there's a clearer song about the pain of abortion. The juxtaposition of all those different psychic things in your head and all the confusion, the anger, the frustration, you have to capture in those words.\\" In the BBC documentary series Classic Albums (2007) about The Sex Pistols' \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\" album Lydon further said: \\"That song was hated and loathed. It's not anti-abortion, it's not pro-abortion. It's: 'Think about it. Don't be callous about a human being, but don't be limited about a thing as 'morals' either. Because it's immoral to bring a kid in this world and not give a toss about it.'\\" Along with the later \\"Belsen Was a Gas,\\" it is probably the most graphic and controversial Sex Pistols song in both its subject matter and style. A 2017 article in The Independent described the song as \\"a gurgling bloody depiction of an abortion replete with a volley of expletives from Rotten\\". Musically, it is also the fastest and heaviest song in the Sex Pistols canon ‚Äî characterized by thudding drums, droning buzzsaw guitar, and shouted vocals. Recording \\"Bodies\\" is one of two songs on Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols which original Pistols bassist Glen Matlock did not co-write. It is also the only song on the album on which Sid Vicious actually plays bass, although his part was later overdubbed by Steve Jones, after Matlock refused to return to play the part. The song was, like all other Sex Pistols songs, credited to the entire band, though Vicious was in the hospital with hepatitis when the band wrote it. Other versions The Sex Pistols' album Filthy Lucre Live - recorded at Finsbury Park, London on 23 June 1996, and released on 29 July that year - includes a performance of \\"Bodies.\\" This same performance is a B-side on the \\"Pretty Vacant (live)\\" single, under the title \\"Buddies,\\" and is a different mix from the track on the live album (the audience noise is mixed much higher, with John Lydon's vocal barely audible under the audience singing the first verse). \\"Buddies\\" is a bonus track on the Japanese edition of Filthy Lucre Live. In the film Sid and Nancy the title characters, played by Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb, sing the song for the siblings of Nancy Spungen to their delight and to the horror of their parents. In 2005, a \\"barnyard\\" arrangement by Steve Jones and Scott Weiland was performed on Jones' radio show, with the use of the word \\"fuck\\" changed to \\"pluck\\". The song has been covered by Liam Gallagher, Veruca Salt, Velvet Revolver, Suede, The Almighty, Killing Joke, Sepultura, and Raimundos, References External links * Category:1977 songs Category:Sex Pistols songs Category:Songs about abortion Category:Songs written by Paul Cook Category:Songs written by Steve Jones (musician) Category:Songs written by Sid Vicious Category:Songs written by John Lydon Category:Song recordings produced by Chris Thomas (record producer) ","title":"Bodies (Sex Pistols song)"},{"id":"4503630","text":"Define the Great Line is the fifth album by American rock band Underoath. The album was released in the United States on June 20, 2006, along with a limited edition version containing exclusive artwork and DVD. For the recording of this album, Underoath's usual producer, James Paul Wisner, was replaced by Adam Dutkiewicz of Killswitch Engage and Matt Goldman. The album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 charts selling over 98,000 copies in its first week, and within a week of its release it became the highest charting Christian album on the Billboard 200 since 1997. Musical style and lyrical themes The title of the album, according to keyboardist Christopher Dudley, comes from \\"defining that line for yourself between becoming the man or the woman that you want to be and the man or the woman other people want you to be.\\" Alternative Press used the title as an example of how on this album Underoath seemed \\"acutely aware of the line that separates their spiritual core from the painful reality of being human,\\" and how \\"even successful musicians need help staying on the right side of that line.\\" Unlike They're Only Chasing Safety, Define the Great Line was written by both Spencer Chamberlain (vocals) and Aaron Gillespie (drums). Alternative Press noted Chamberlain's lyrical presence, saying that \\"between Chamberlain's deeply troubled writing and drummer/singer Aaron Gillespie's, Define sounds like a group-therapy session put to tape.\\" For its lyrics the band maintained its focus on Christianity and personal struggles, and according to Josh Taylor of Jesus Freak Hideout the big difference was \\"the frequency at which God is addressed by name,\\" though all of these mentions were in \\"exclamations of desperation.\\" The main lyrical themes of the album expressed pain, weariness, and frustration, \\"but not without the awareness that things need to change.\\" These themes were praised by AllMusic, which stated that \\"while Underoath explore their faith with both reverence and suspicion, something that sets them apart from the polarizing righteousness of many CCM acts, their crossover potential remains huge, as the prevailing themes of isolation, anger, introspection, and the quest for self-confidence are universal.\\" According to the band the lyrics are \\"deeply personal\\" to Chamberlain and relate to things in his life 'that have molded him into the person he is today.' Define the Great Line abandoned the pop choruses of the They're Only Chasing Safety and instead demonstrated a heavier and more eclectic style. The band themselves said that the heavier style was \\"nothing super intentional, they [the songs] just came out that way when we went to write.\\" Define the Great Line was noted as a turning point for Underoath, with AllMusic commenting that \\"while the tendency to dissolve into the abyss of angtsy emo-pop was still there,\\" there was a \\"darkness lurking in the nooks and crannies between the crackling snare hits and heavy 'drop-d' riffing\\" that would be fully realized on the follow up release, Lost in the Sound of Separation. Alternative Press mentioned that the band had updated its \\"early, brutal style with weird time changes and post- metal ambience.\\" Cross Rhythms described the album as \\"an impressively versatile project where metal riffs and emo breakdowns, screamo noise and memorable hooks collide in a veritable sonic feast,\\" and Allmusic described the band as finding the \\"delicate middle ground between throat-shredding grindcore and My Chemical Romance/From Autumn to Ashes-style emo-punk.\\" Release In early May 2006, the band performed at the Bamboozle festival. The album was released on June 20. \\"Writing on the Walls\\" was released to radio on June 27. In October and November, the group went on the 2006 international edition of the Taste of Chaos tour, visiting New Zealand, Australia, Japan and Europe. \\"You're Ever So Inviting\\" was released to radio on January 23, 2007. In May, the band headlined the Dirty South Tour in the U.S. with support from Norma Jean and Maylene and the Sons of Disaster. From late July to early August, the band went on the 2007 edition of Warped Tour. On September 12, a music video was released for \\"A Moment Suspended in Time\\". It was directed by Popcore Film and was filmed in Sweden. Between late September and early November, the band went on the headlining fall tour with support from Every Time I Die, Maylene and the Sons of Disaster and Poison the Well. Prior to the album's release, unfinished versions of the album began circulating the internet, prompting the band to acknowledge the audio files were stolen, but the tracks were not the final versions of the songs. Reception Define the Great Line received universal acclaim from critics. Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms said the release was Underoath's big breakthrough into the mainstream, and Jesus Freak Hideout called the album \\"the most anticipated release of the year.\\" HM Magazine called the album \\"nearly perfect,\\" and an Alternative Press review gave the album a full five stars, putting forward Gillespie as \\"the beautiful melodic counterpart to Chamberlain's crushing heaviness,\\" and when discussing the band's style said \\"call it focused aggression if you want; 'vision' works just as well.\\" AllMusic gave the album three-point-five out of five stars and described Define the Great Line as a \\"mammoth production that exemplifies how far Christian metal has come since the days of Stryper and Bloodgood\\", and called it \\"blistering and occasionally majestic.\\" Both Jesus Freak Hideout and Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms called the album the best hardcore album of the year, with Jesus Freak Hideout giving the album four-point-five out of five stars and Tony Cummings rating the album a full ten-out-of-ten squares. In 2017, Loudwire ranked the album 24th on its list of the \\"25 Greatest Metalcore albums of all-time\\". Chart performance The album sold very well and debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 charts, selling over 98,000 copies in its first week. By August 2006, the album had sold over 220,000 copies. On November 11, 2006 the album was certified gold by the RIAA, confirming the sale of over 500,000 copies. The album's lead single \\"Writing on the Walls\\" was nominated for a 2007 Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. Track listing The song \\"Writing on the Walls\\" was featured in the 2007 video game called ATV Offroad Fury Pro and \\"You're Ever So Inviting\\" was featuring in Madden NFL 07. The song \\"S√°lmarnir\\" contains Psalm 50, verses 1 to 6. The title itself is the Icelandic word for \\"psalms,\\" though the Bible passage in the song is recited in Russian.

Since an increasing percentage of people in the United States (at least) now have access to a computer at home and at work or school, one may have to divide the reported total of unique users in half. Then, another increasing fraction of people regularly delete cookies from their machines‚Äîpresumably both at home and at work‚Äîand yet another large fraction use more than one browser on each of their machines. This means that for a typical news site, for example, which people might typically visit more than once a day to keep up with breaking news, the reported unique users might overstate the number of different people by a factor of four. On the plus side, for those wishing to impress advertisers or investors, the reported number of sessions or visits and pageviews are probably more accurate, so that smaller group of people visits much more often and looks at more pages than the raw numbers would suggest. Understanding unique users numbers Similar to the TURF (Total Unduplicated Reach and Frequency) metric often used in television, radio and newspaper analyses, Unique Users is a measure of the distribution of content to a number of distinct consumers. A common mistake in using Unique User numbers is adding up Unique User numbers across dimensions. A Unique User metric is only valid for its given set of dimensions e.g. time, browsers. For example, a website may have 100 unique users on each day (day being the dimension) of a particular week. With only this data, one cannot extrapolate the number of weekly Unique Users (only that the Unique User count for the week is between 100 and 700). However, website administrators who can track unique user traffic over a longer period of time can build up a reliable view on their performance against direct competitors within the sector. Online businesses tend to have a static conversation rate ratio between unique users and new business clients. When calculating movement of unique users through conversion funnel the same time period must be used at every step. Limitations of unique user numbers Unique user counts for websites are typically counted by using cookies. When a browser visits a website, the website checks for the existence of a particular cookie. If the cookie is present, the cookie value is captured. If the cookie is not present, the website will create a cookie. Unique visitor Unique visitors refers to the number of distinct individuals requesting pages from the website during a given period, regardless of how often they visit. Visits refer to the number of times a site is visited, no matter how many visitors make up those visits. When an individual goes to a website on Tuesday, then again on Wednesday, this is recorded as two visits from one visitor.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project. The purpose of tracking unique visitors is to help marketers understand website user behavior. Because a visitor can make multiple visits in a specified period, the number of visits may be greater than the number of visitors. A visitor is sometimes referred to as a unique visitor or a unique user to clearly convey the idea that each visitor is only counted once. The measurement of users or visitors requires a standard time period and can be distorted by automatic activity (such as bots) that classify web content. Estimation of visitors, visits, and other traffic statistics are usually filtered to remove this type of activity by eliminating known IP addresses for bots, by requiring registration or cookies, or by using panel data.

Lilly likes to forget her age and concentrate on having fun. She has a rude awakening when she is mugged in 1999, and fun-loving Lilly is never quite the same again. Storylines Lilly was a former hoofer with the Westwood Girls (a showgirl), performing throughout Europe and the Far East at the close of World War II. She was married to Jack Temple, manager of the Westwood Girls, until he died in 1983. She arrives in Albert Square in 1998 when she moves into a flat with fellow senior-citizen Dot Cotton (June Brown) when both of their respective homes burn down. Lilly's fun-loving, cheeky personality is in stark contrast to Dot's and the two often wind each other up with their obvious personality differences. She once even tries to persuade Dot that Jeff Healy (Leslie Schofield) has amorous intentions towards her, which has Dot in a bit of a fluster. She is also the first known person in the Square, before Jeff himself, to refer to her consistently as \\"Dorothy\\". Lilly is never one to let her age spoil her fun and she often gives the youngsters of Walford a run for their money by clubbing in e20, trouncing Huw Edwards (Richard Elis) and Lenny Wallace (Desune Coleman) at a game of poker and making an exhibition of herself in salsa classes. Her penchant for late-night clubbing even prompts owner Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) to bar her from his club, for fear that she will upstage his younger clientele. Lilly works for Terry and Irene Raymond (Gavin Richards and Roberta Taylor) at the First Til' Last grocery store, and when coming home from one of her late shifts she is mugged by an armed youth. After this ordeal, Lilly becomes a recluse, not wanting to go out for fear of being attacked again. Suddenly faced with her own fragility, Lilly is forced to deal with the realisation that she isn't as strong or independent as she thought. It takes many months for Lilly to face the outside world and her personality is changed forever as a result. Lilly and Dot's differences soon begin to take their toll and in 1999 Lilly makes the decision to leave Walford and move into sheltered accommodation when the insurance cheque for her flat comes through, leaving Dot to move in with Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Character creation and development The character Lilly Mattock, played by Barbara Keogh, was introduced in November 1998 by the executive producer of EastEnders, Matthew Robinson. Lilly was one of several characters introduced in the latter part of 1998, redressing the cast balance following Robinson's decision to axe a large proportion of characters, earlier in the year. Lilly was brought in as an elderly companion for the long-running character Dot Cotton, played by June Brown; the characters move in together following the destruction of their block of flats. Described as \\"the silver-haired gossip\\", Lilly was intended to be a \\"comedy double act\\" with Dot, taking over the place of Dot's former sparring partner, Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin). Storylines concentrate on the obvious personality differences between Dot and Lilly, and the problems this causes. The majority of Lilly's storylines are comic, for which she has been praised by Merle Brown, critic for the Daily Record. She is also used to highlight a more serious issue, when in 1999 she is mugged by a criminal called Gareth, and subsequently becomes agoraphobic, refusing to go out. Though she eventually gets over this with Dot's assistance. Lilly's backstory was revealed in her official biography on the BBC website, told from the character's perspective: Departure In September 1999, Lilly Mattock became the 26th character to be axed from EastEnders by Matthew Robinson, less than a year after her arrival. The character was never given an official exit, and was just quietly dropped from the serial, making her last appearance on 2 September 1999. In the storyline she has an argument with flatmate Dot Cotton after blurting out in The Queen Victoria public house that Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) is HIV positive. A few weeks later, Dot is seen moving into the house of Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), citing irreconcilable differences with Lilly. The decision to axe Lilly was reportedly prompted by actress June Brown, who plays Dot Cotton. Brown had allegedly complained that the comedy double act between Dot and Lilly was not right. A BBC insider told The People newspaper \\"[Dot and Lilly were] supposed to be two pensioners providing comedy scenes but June thought it was rubbish. She even threatened to walk out but now she's staying on with the promise of better storylines\\". Actress Barbara Keogh was said to be \\"devastated\\" by the decision.

History A monastery was founded in Lambach in about 1040 by Count Arnold II of Lambach-Wels. His son, Bishop Adalbero of W√ºrzburg (later canonised), changed the monastery into a Benedictine abbey in 1056, which it has been since. During the 17th and 18th centuries a great deal of work in the Baroque style was carried out, much of it by the Carlone family. Lambach escaped the dissolution of the monasteries of Emperor Joseph II in the 1780s. In 1897/98, Adolf Hitler lived in the town of Lambach with his parents and attended the monastery school, where he saw the Hakenkreuz (hooked cross) used in decorative carving on the stone and woodwork of the building. He later used it as a symbol for the Nazi Party, placing it in a white circle with a red background for use as a flag. Cultural features Bishop Adalbero Between Easter Sunday and 31. of October guided tours are offered every day at 14:00. The tour includes entrance to the Romanesque frescoes, the Baroque theatre, the library and the Baroque church. The abbey has preserved much of cultural interest. It contains the oldest extant Romanesque frescoes in Southern Germany and Austria, and the former abbey tavern, now a pharmacy, with a beautiful Baroque fa√ßade. The abbey's Baroque theatre has also been restored to working order and the summer refectory from the early 18th century by Carlo Antonio Carlone has been converted into a concert hall. The ambulatory by Diego Carlone from the same period is of great magnificence. An unexpected feature is the set of Baroque dwarves in the monastery garden (see also Gleink Abbey). The abbey church was also refurbished in the Baroque style, with an organ by Christoph Egedacher and contains the tomb of Saint Adelbero. The abbey also possesses the medieval St. Adelbero's Chalice, although it is rarely on view to the public, besides a large collection of sacred art. The library was constructed about 1691 and contains approximately 50,000 volumes as well as archive material. Since 1625 the abbey has belonged to the Austrian Congregation, which now forms part of the Benedictine Confederation.

The miniature village included many houses and trains that would travel around and between the houses. Other features included radio-controlled miniature boats. It was an entertaining attraction for both children and adults. In 1983, the Miniature Village served as the filming location for an episode of the Canadian television series The Littlest Hobo, entitled \\"Small Pleasures\\" (season 4, episode 16). During the Winter holiday season, Cullen Gardens was host to the Festival of Lights, which featured huge displays of Christmas lights throughout the grounds, often decorating large topiaries.  Closure and redevelopment On 1 January 2006, Cullen Gardens and Miniature Village closed. The land, however, has since been purchased by the Town of Whitby, to remain in the public domain as a municipal park. There has been speculation that the property may link up with the Heber Down conservation area. At the time of its closure, the park was co-owned by Sue Cullen-Green and Bryan Green. The miniature Village no longer exists at the site and the model buildings were sold to the nearby City of Oshawa for $234,000.

It consists of the National Assembly as the upper house and the House of Representatives as the lower house. History Legislatures of Kingdom of Nepal The former Parliament of Nepal was dissolved by King Gyanendra in 2002, on the grounds that it was incapable of handling the Maoist rebels. The country's five main political parties had staged protests against the king, arguing that he must either call fresh elections or reinstate the elected legislature. In 2004, the king announced that parliamentary elections would be held within twelve months; in April 2006, in response to major pro-democratic protests, it was announced that Parliament would be reestablished.  Interim Legislature of Nepal After the success of the April 2006 people's movement, on January 15, 2007, the old parliament was dissolved and replaced by a 330-member interim legislature of Nepal. The legislature drafted an interim constitution and a constituent assembly election was held in April 2008. The 601-member assembly on 28 May 2008 abolished the 238-year-old monarchy and declared the country a republic. The constituent assembly, which was initially given two years to draft a new constitution, was dissolved on 27 May 2012 after its failure to draft a new constitution due to differences over restructuring the state. Legislature Parliament of Nepal The second Nepalese Constituent Assembly was converted into a legislative parliament of Nepal after the promulgation of the constitution on September 20, 2015. The second Nepalese Constituent Assembly was formed after the failure of the first Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution. The Legislature Parliament of Nepal was dissolved on 21 January 2018 (7 Magh, 2074 BS). Composition According to the Constitution of Nepal 2015, Nepal has a two-chamber Parliament (), consisting of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the President of Nepal acting as their head.  President of Nepal  The President of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal () is the head of state of Nepal and commander in chief of the Nepalese Armed Forces and the supreme leader of the country. The office was created in May 2008 after the country was declared as a republic. The first President of Nepal was Ram Baran Yadav. The current president is Bidhya Devi Bhandari, elected in October 2015. She is the first female Nepali head of state. The President is to be formally addressed as \\"The Right Honourable\\" ().  House of Representatives  The House of Representatives () has 275 members. 165 members are elected from single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting and 110 elected through proportional electoral system where voters vote for political parties, considering the whole country as a single election constituency. The members of the house hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers.  National Assembly  The National Assembly () has 59 members. Eight members are elected from each of the seven provinces by an electoral college of each province, and three are appointed by the President on recommendation of the government. They must include at least three women, one Dalit, and one member from disabled groups. Members serve staggered six year terms such that the term of one-third members expires every two years.

It is situated about to the north of Krems an der Donau in the Waldviertel. It was founded in 1144Ôºåby Countess Hildeburg of Poigen-Rebgau. Throughout its history it suffered numerous invasions and attacks, and was destroyed by the Swedes in 1645. Under Emperor Joseph II in 1793 the abbey was forbidden to accept new novices, but unlike many others in Austria it succeeded in remaining functional. The abbey attained its present Baroque form under the direction of abbots Maurus Boxler and Placidus Much. The modernization of the abbey was supervised by the architect Josef Munggenast with support from some of the most distinguished artists and craftsmen of Austria: Paul Troger on the frescoes, Franz Josef Holzinger on the stucco work, and Johann Georg Hoppl on the marbling. The Baroque structure which replaced the earlier Romanesque abbey is said to be one of the finest in Austria. History Altenburg Abbey was founded in 1144 by Countess Hildeburg of Poigen-Rebgau. Archeological excavations carried out by the Federal Monuments Office between 1983 and 2005 have revealed evidence of its dating in the remains of a wall from the 12th century and of a Romanesque cloister dated to the 13th century. The monastery was destroyed and reconstructed as a result of numerous attacks. The first was in 1251 by Hermann V von Baden, followed by several by the Cumans between 1304 and 1327 and during the Hussite Wars from 1427 to 1430. It was attacked by Bohemia, Moravia and Hungary in 1448, and by the Turks in 1552. In 1327, some restoration work was carried out by Gertrude, the widow of Heidenreich von Gars. In 1645, the Swedes destroyed the abbey. A medieval \\"monastery below the monastery\\" Refurbishment took shape after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th and 18th centuries. The abbey took its present form in the Baroque style under the abbots Maurus Boxler and Placidus Much. Work was carried out under the supervision of the architect Josef Munggenast who was assisted by some of Austria's most distinguished artists and craftsmen: Paul Troger for the frescoes, Franz Josef Holzinger for the stucco work, and Johann Georg Hoppl for the marbling. Under Emperor Joseph II in 1793 the abbey was forbidden to accept new novices, but unlike many others in Austria it succeeded in remaining functional. Subsequent to the Revolution of 1848, its debts were cleared by the sale of some of the chapel's major artifacts. On 12 March 1938, Abbot Ambros Minarz refused to fly the Nazi's Swastika flag at the abbey which resulted in its occupation by the Sturmabteilung (a paramilitary organization of the Nazis SA) from 17 March 1938. For a brief period between 1940‚Äì1941 under the National Socialists the abbey was suspended, and in 1941 dissolved. The abbot was placed under arrest and the community dispossessed. From 1945 the premises were used as accommodation by Soviet occupying troops. Under Abbot Maurus Knappek (1947‚Äì1968) the buildings were restored and the community re-established. Since 1625, the abbey has been a member of the Austrian Congregation now within the Benedictine Confederation. Archeological excavations carried out in the chapel have revealed a medieval \\"monastery beneath the monastery\\". The finds include a refectory, a chapter house, the monks' working and living quarters, a cloister, a scriptorium, and a Gothic St. Vitus Chapel. Layout plan The abbey occupies a very large area with the front fa√ßade, which faces east, itself occupying a length of 200 m surrounded by a number of landscaped gardens. The abbey complex has 12 identified areas of: 1\\\\. Fountain Court 2\\\\. Convent Court 3\\\\. Kitchen Court 4\\\\. Prelates Court 5\\\\. Church Court 6\\\\. Johann's Court 7\\\\. Great Abbey Court 8\\\\. Abbey Church 9\\\\. Library Wing (Crypt) 10\\\\. Marble Wing (Sala terrena) 11\\\\. Inner Medieval Monastery (Cloister) 12\\\\. Outer Medieval Monastery> Features Library The abbey displays a fusion of Baroque and Rococo stucco architectural styles in its interiors. During the reconstruction, the library, imperial staircase and marble hall were added. The staircase, abbey church and library are noted for the frescoes painted by Paul Troger. Those in the vestibule leading to the library are the work of his student, Johann Jakob Zeiller. The library, built in 1740, is of Baroque architectural elegance, an imposing room that rises to three stories in height. The library hall is long and its ceiling is decorated with frescoes crafted by Paul Troger. Among the many frescoes, the distinctive ones are the Judgment of Solomon, the Wisdom of God and the Light of Faith. Beneath the library is a large crypt which is also decorated with many frescoes by unknown artists; one particular scene which is fierce in appearance is that of the Dance of Death. The church is oval-shaped and bears a dome. It was renovated in 1730‚Äì33 by Joseph Munggenast. The dome is also decorated with Troger frescoes. The main feature of the altarpiece is a painting Assumption of Mary, topped by a representation of the Trinity. Gardens Garten der Religionen In recent years, a number of well-tended gardens in different styles have been developed around the monastery. They were all planted by the monks themselves with assistance from the Natur im Garten project as well as from nurseries in the area. Once the abbey park, Der Garten der Religionen (the Garden of Religions) is the largest of the gardens. It was recently used for growing Christmas trees and fruit trees. The garden now consists of five landscaped areas dedicated to the world's five main religions ‚Äì Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. It also has a large natural pond surrounded by a meadow full of wild flowers, a group of trees, and the old plum grove where the local livestock can be seen. There is also an apple tree area reflecting the \\"monastery under the monastery\\" theme. Der Apothekergarten (the Apothecary Garden) on the eastern side of the monastery has been developed on the spot where there once used to be a garden of herbs which were used for medicinal purposes in the Middle Ages. The present garden has been developed along more modern lines of horticultural science. Der Sch√∂pfungsgarten (the Garden of Creation) has been developed on the southern part of the abbey church where the Source Garden used to be. The theme of the park is theological: the story of the creation. There is a bench under the large walnut tree which has been cited as one of the best spots to be on a hot summer's day. Der Garten der Stille (the Garden of Tranquillity), the most recent addition, has been developed to the east where there used to be a game reserve. It is a naturally landscaped garden consisting of an orchard, a vineyard, an area for butterflies, insect hives and a hobby garden.

The film was initially set to be released by Vestron Pictures and its offshoot label Lightning Pictures, but it was ultimately released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer which acquired the film due to Vestron's financial problems and eventual bankruptcy. Lawrence Kasanoff, Vestron's head of production at the time, green lit and produced the movie.  Plot  Megan Turner is a rookie NYPD patrol officer who shoots and kills a robber by emptying her service revolver while he is holding up a neighborhood market. The robber‚Äôs .44 Magnum Smith & Wesson Model 29 handgun goes into the air and lands on the floor of the market as the robber is blown backward through the front window. As she continues to the checkout area, Turner nearly steps on the robber‚Äôs handgun lying directly in front of Eugene Hunt, one of the customers lying on the floor. Unnoticed, Hunt takes the gun and slips away. Because the robber's weapon was not found at the scene and the other witnesses are unclear about seeing a handgun, Turner is accused of killing an unarmed man. While she attempts to clear her name with Assistant Chief Stanley Hoyt and her superiors, the suspended Turner begins dating Hunt, who has become obsessed with her. Hunt, a commodities trader, has taken the gun and started committing random killings. At the first killing he leaves behind a spent shell on which he has carved Meagan Turner‚Äôs name. One night, at his apartment he displays an unusual interest in Megan‚Äôs gun and her shooting stance. He reveals that he was in the supermarket at the time of the hold-up, and that he left with the perpetrator's gun and that he is the person behind the recent killings. Turner arrests him but he is freed by his attorney, Mel Dawson, due to a lack of concrete evidence. Turner fights to keep her badge and solve the murders with the help of Detective Nick Mann. Hunt turns up at her apartment, assaults Megan and shoots her best friend, Tracy, before rendering Turner unconscious with a blow to the head with the gun. Hunt buries the gun in a park. Turner revives and goes to Hunt's apartment with Mann to arrest him, but Hunt's attorney prevents her from doing so and threatens to once more have her fired. Seeking comfort from her mother, Turner visits her family home, an uncomfortable place because her father physically abused her mother throughout her childhood. When she arrives, she finds that her mother is bruised. Enraged, Turner handcuffs her father and arrests him. During the drive they stop and off talk in an attempt to finally put an end to his abuse. When they return to the house, Hunt is posing as a guest sitting with her mother. A tense exchange takes place between the two, where they both imply that they are armed. When he leaves, she goes to his apartment, where she spends the night staking him out. The next morning, Turner follows Hunt to the park, where he has buried his gun. Mann interrupts another standoff between Hunt and Turner, where Megan is attempting to get Hunt to try for her gun and Hunt runs off. Believing that he will return for the murder weapon, they stake out the park. Turner sees the beam of a flashlight and assumes it is Hunt searching for the gun. She leaves the car to apprehend him, but not before handcuffing Mann to the steering wheel to prevent him from following her. The flashlight turns out to be a ruse: Hunt paid a homeless woman to decoy the police. Back at the car, Hunt is outside the car holding Mann at gunpoint and is about to kill him. Turner appears and fires her gun, shooting Hunt in the left arm before he escapes in traffic. Mann and Turner return to her apartment, where unbeknownst to them, Hunt is patching up his wound in her bathroom. Turner and Mann have sex and Mann is ambushed by Hunt and shot when he goes to the bathroom. Turner does not hear the shot because it was muffled by a towel. Hunt attacks and rapes Megan and she eventually kicks him away and gets her hands on her gun and shoots at him, but he flees. Mann is unconscious and taken to the hospital, where Turner is told that he will make it. Determined to find Hunt and finish him off, Turner knocks out her police guard and takes his uniform and gun. She wanders the streets and Hunt follows her into the subway. Turner and Hunt are both shot and the gun fight carries on out to the street. Megan finally shoots and kills him after a long and violent confrontation in the middle of Wall Street after running him down with an abandoned car and him running out of bullets. She empties her gun into Hunt. Other police arrive and she is taken away in an ambulance.

The site is one of the venues of an annual music festival called \\"Carinthian Summer\\".  History  In 878 the East Frankish king Carloman of Bavaria dedicated the Treffen estates around Lake Ossiach to the Benedictine monastery of √ñtting. In the late 10th century the lands passed to the Bishops of Passau and later to Emperor Henry II, who conferred them to a certain Count Ozi, affiliated with the Styrian Otakar dynasty and father of Patriarch Poppo of Aquileia. A church probably already existed at Ossiach, when Count Ozi about 1024 established the Benedictine abbey, the first in the medieval Duchy of Carinthia. The first monks probably descended from Niederaltaich Abbey in Bavaria. Ozi's son Poppo succeeded in removing the proprietary monastery from the influence of the Salzburg archbishops and to affiliate it with the Patriarchate of Aquileia, confirmed by Emperor Conrad II in 1028. Upon the extinction of the Styrian Otakars in 1192, the Vogtei of Ossiach according to the Georgenberg Pact passed to the Austrian House of Babenberg. In 1282 it finally fell to the Habsburgs. The Romanesque church itself was first mentioned in 1215, built on the groundplan of a basilica, with the tower above the crossing. Restored in a Late Gothic style after a fire in 1484, the abbey, a member of the Benedictine Salzburg Congregation from 1641, was extensively altered in the Baroque period, including stucco decoration of the Wessobrunner School. Ossiach Abbey was dissolved by order of Emperor Joseph II in 1783, after which the buildings were used as a barracks. In 1816 the premises were largely demolished. Between 1872 and 1915 the few remaining buildings were again used as a barracks and as stabling. Since 1995 the premises have been owned by the administration of Carinthia. The church since the dissolution has served the local parish. Two stained glass windows were donated by Karl May in 1905, though according to recent research the popular writer had probably never visited Ossiach.Gustav Renker, Wilhelm Brauneder, Willi Rainer, Karl May in Ossiach.

There the king is said to have lived in the remote monastery as a mute penitent for eight years humbly doing the meanest and lowliest jobs, until on his death bed he told his father confessor who he was and what he had been doing penance for.Alois Pischinger, Sagen aus √ñsterreich. Vienna: Carl Ueberreuter 1949, pp. 233-235 The legend is documented since the 15th century; whether Boles≈Çaw actually ever lived at Ossiach could not be conclusively clarified. Boles≈Çaw's alleged tomb is embedded in the northern side of the church wall, a Roman marble relief depicting a horse with the Latin inscription: REX BOLESLAVS OCCISOR SANCTI STANISLAI EPISCOPI CRACOVIENSIS (\\"Boleslav, King of Poland, Murderer of Saint Stanislav, Bishop of Cracow\\"). Above it, a painted epitaph shows several illustrations of the king's fate. A memorial stone was added by Polish servicemen in 1946.

He was admired by Emperor Charles V for both his military and literary talents. Life Of noble birth, he devoted his youth to arms and fought as a soldier in Italy under the command of Alfonso d'Avalos in the War of Piedmont between the French and the Holy Roman Empire. He also served in Germany. During this period he wrote verses to two ladies known as \\"Silvia\\" and \\"Galatea\\". Captured by the French, he was released by the emperor Charles, who appointed him governor of Querasco. In 1557 he participated in the Battle of St. Quentin. About 1560 he abandoned his military career and moved back to Spain, marrying a cousin named Juana de Z√∫√±iga. He settled in Granada, where he and Diego Hurtado de Mendoza became the most famous of local poets. He died at Granada in 1580. Literary works Hernando de Acu√±a represents the first generation of Petrachian poets in Spain. He is best known for sonnets, eclogues and elegies. Several works were dedicated to Charles V, including the well-known sonnet \\"Ya se acerca, se√±or, o ya es llegada\\", which sums up Charles' political creed as \\"Un monarca, un imperio y una espada\\". As a pastoral poet he excelled. His translation of le Chevalier d√©lib√©r√©, the well-known chivalric romance by Olivier de la Marche, under the title of El Cavallero Determinado, was much esteemed by the emperor; so indeed were his translations from Ovid and Juan Bosc√°n Almog√°ver, and his Poes√≠as varias.

In 1738 Sieur Louis Damours de Louvi√®res built Fort Rouge on the Assiniboine River for Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V√©rendrye. La V√©rendrye and his sons, Louis-Joseph and Francois, proceeded further west on the Assiniboine and constructed Fort La Reine. The fort seems to have had a primary purpose as a depot and was abandoned by 1749. A new commandant of the French western forts, Jacques Legardeur de Saint- Pierre, spent the winter of 1752‚Äì1753 at the Forks, and likely rebuilt Fort Rouge at its original location. Much research points to this site being on the north bank of the Assiniboine near the forks although some scholars place the original fort on the south bank.

The law was passed on 4 June 1987. It dictates that it must be assumed, without admitting proof to the contrary, that all officers and their subordinates including common personnel of the Armed Forces, the Police, the Penitentiary Service and other security agencies cannot be legally punished by crimes committed during the dictatorship as they were acting out of due obedience, that is, obeying orders from their superiors (in this case, the heads of the military government, who had already been tried in the Trial of the Juntas). This law was passed one year after the full stop law in order to contain the discontent of the Armed Forces. It effectively exempted military personnel under the rank of Colonel from responsibility for their crimes, which included forced disappearances, illegal detentions, torture and murders. Its text is rather short, with only 7 articles, the second of which contains an exception (the law does not apply to cases of rape, disappearance or identity forgery of minors, or extensive appropriation of real estate). The Ley de Obediencia Debida and the Ley de Punto Final were repealed by the National Congress in August 2003, which allowed for the re-opening of cases that involved crimes against humanity. The first of such cases, which involved the former Buenos Aires Provincial Police second-in-command Miguel Etchecolatz, ended in September 2006 and laid down jurisprudence by acknowledging that the dictatorship's state terrorism was a form of genocide.BBC News, 13 August 2003.

It is a specialised plastic enclosure designed to hold silicon wafers securely and safely in a controlled environment, and to allow the wafers to be transferred between machines for processing or measurement. FOUPs began to appear along with the first 300mm wafer processing tools in the mid 1990s. The size of the wafers and their comparative lack of rigidity meant that SMIF was not a viable technology. FOUPs were designed with the constraints of 300mm in mind, with the removable cassette being replaced by fins in the FOUP which hold the wafers in place, and the bottom opening door being replaced by a front opening door to allow robot handling mechanisms to access the wafers directly from the FOUP. The weight of a fully loaded 25 wafer FOUP at around 9 kilograms means that automated material handling systems are essential for all but the smallest of fabrication plants. To allow this, each FOUP has various coupling plates, pins and holes to allow the FOUP to be located on a load port, and to be manipulated by the AMHS (Automated Material Handling System). FOUPs may also contain RF tags that allow them to be identified by readers on tools, in the AMHS etc. FOUPs are available in several colors, depending on the customer's wish.

The Yuga Purana is a Sanskrit text and the last chapter of a Jyotisha (astrology) text Vriddhagargiya Samhita. It is also considered a minor text in the Puranic literature. Contents Indo- Greek warrior, from Bharhut, c.100 BCE The Yuga Purana is structured as a chronicle, and is notable for historical information presented as a prophecy. It is the only surviving Indian text that includes a detailed description of Greeks who advanced into India after Alexander the Great, and the Indo-Greek conquest of Pataliputra, the capital of the Mauryan Empire.A Comprehensive History Of Ancient India, Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd, 2003, p.90 It includes mythology, but also chronicles the Magadha empire, Maurya emperor Shalishuka, the Shunga dynasty the Yavanas, and Sakas. The record is described in the style of a \\"prophecy\\" (future tense), as if the text was written before recorded human history began. The invasion of the Yavanas (i.e., Indo-Greeks, under Demetrius I or Menander I, c. 180 BCE) is described in a rather detailed account: :\\"After having conquered Saketa, the country of the Panchala and the Mathuras, the Yavanas, wicked and valiant, will reach Kusumadhvaja (\\"The town of the flower-standard\\", Pataliputra). The thick mud-fortifications at Pataliputra being reached, all the provinces will be in disorder, without doubt. Ultimately, a great battle will follow, with tree-like engines (siege engines).\\" (Gargi-Samhita Paragraph 5, Yuga Purana.)The Sungas, Kanvas, Republican Kingdoms and Monarchies, Mahameghavahanas, Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, p.6 :\\"The Yavanas (Greeks) will command, the Kings will disappear. (But ultimately) the Yavanas, intoxicated with fighting, will not stay in Madhyadesa (the Middle Country); there will be undoubtedly a civil war among them, arising in their own country (Bactria), there will be a terrible and ferocious war.\\" (Gargi-Samhita, Yuga Purana chapter, No7).The Sungas, Kanvas, Republican Kingdoms and Monarchies, Mahameghavahanas, Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, p.6 Manuscripts and Date The extant manuscripts of the Yuga Purana are in poor form and considered by scholars as highly corrupted over its history, although recent \\"research has [...] been concerned with establishing a more acceptable text\\". Its importance is contested, with claims ranging from possibly the \\"oldest surviving text\\" with Purana in its title, to \\"quite late and worthless\\" manuscript. The few manuscripts discovered are highly inconsistent, and early 20th-century translators reconstructed the manuscript by \\"liberally altering\\" proper names in the text to arrive at \\"guesses at truth\\" that these manuscripts might have intended. Scholars in the early 20th century (Fleet in 1912, and later William Tarn in 1938) stated that this text is a late text and dismissed the Yuga Purana as historically worthless, with Tarn adding that \\"naturally, I cannot be sure\\". However, the situation has been improved by the discovery of eight more manuscripts by Indologist John Mitchiner, who has produced a complete translation of the text. Sanskrit scholar Ludo Rocher says that \\"The Yuga [Purana] is important primarily as a historical document. It is a matter-of-fact chronicle [...] of the Magadha empire, down to the breakdown of the Sungas and the arrival of the Sakas. It is unique in its description of the invasion and retirement of the Yavanas in Magadha.\\" John Mitchiner suggests it to be one of the useful, important and oldest Purana giving it an estimate of c. 25 BCE because of the archaic, unusual Sanskrit found in the text.Yuga Purana, J Mitchiner (Translator), pages vii-viii, 3-5, 81-82 Mitchiner notes that the manuscripts themselves were likely copied from their sources in 18th or 19th century, but a stemmatic study of the various manuscripts indicates that they are derived from a source \\"considerably earlier than A.D. 1000.\\"Yuga Purana, J Mitchiner (Translator), pages 5, 22-24 A few scholars place the origin of this astrology-related text to between 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE. Other scholars suggest that this text is written with a mix of Prakrit and Sanskrit languages, but attribute this to \\"extreme corruption\\" of the text. There is no consensus on an acceptable version of the text. However, the situation has been improved by the discovery of eight more manuscripts by Indologist John Mitchiner, who has produced a complete translation of the text.

The school serves students in the Marietta City School District in grades nine through twelve. As of 2010‚Äì2011, the approximate enrollment was 1,050. Marietta's mascot is Tabby the tiger and its colors are orange and black. The school's rival is Warren High School. The school participates in the East Central Ohio League within the Scarlet Division. MHS is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and the Ohio Department of Education. History The current building first opened as a replacement for what is now Marietta Middle School. The auditorium/gymnasium and \\"vo-ag\\" buildings were part of the original construction. As enrollment increased, more parking lots were added as well. The school converted from a seven-period day to an eight-period day during the 2010‚Äì2011 school year. In 2013 a million dollar project took place that included closing in the breezeway between the auditorium/gymnasium building and the main school building. Also in this project, a new section to the school building was added so that all classes would be in the main school building, converting the Vo-Ag building into an administrative office. The \\"Isaac Danford Memorial Weight Room\\" was founded in 2015 Extracurricular activities MHS offers numerous clubs/groups, including a wide array of sports teams including men's basketball, soccer, football, tennis, track, cross country and swimming. Woman's athletics include soccer, volleyball, cheer, soft ball, swimming and basketball. Students also have the opportunity to participate in the making of the school yearbook \\"The Orian\\" and a school newspaper entitled The Original is a monthly publication printed by The Marietta Times, the city's local daily newspaper. There is also a student Web- Design team at the high school called \\"The Bridge\\". They also have the Marietta High School \\"Wall of Sound\\" Marching Band who competes at band competitions, and local parades and events. The school also has an a cappella singing group, \\"Vocal Point,\\" that performs locally. The school also puts on a yearly musical, which is open to all students in the school district.

Sea Zenith is a four-barrelled 25 mm CIWS used by the Turkish Navy on their MEKO 200 frigates, like the Barbaros and Yavuz classes. It was developed in the 1980s by Oerlikon Contraves (Rheinmetall Air Defence since 2009) around their Oerlikon KBB gun and manufactured in Switzerland. This automatic gun uses a 25x184mm cartridge (longer than the one used by the more common Oerlikon KBA gun) at a rate of 800 rounds a minute. Using four independent guns instead of one multi-barrelled rotary cannon improves reliability. The system is mounted in an enclosed automatic turret and directed by the Seaguard radar developed by Contraves. The turret is tilted back to allow a higher elevation to intercept diving missiles. The system's primary purpose is defence against anti-ship missiles, and other precision guided weapons. However it can also be employed against fixed/rotary wing aircraft, ships and other small craft, coastal targets, and floating mines. Specifications: * Caliber: 25 mm * Barrels: 4 (independent) * Rate of fire: 3,200 rpm * Range: 2 km * Weight: 3500 kg Sea Zenith had a related development, the Sea Shield system. It was mounted above deck and did not have the high elevation capability of the Sea Zenith. Presented in 1989, it was abandoned in the early 1990s. The Myriad system, developed by Breda and Contraves (among others) was a related weapon. It used two 25mm 7-barrelled KBD Gatling gun, also developed by Oerlikon. Compared to the Sea Zenith, the firing rate is higher (10,000 rounds a minute), but the effective range is limited to one kilometer.

He is best known for his work on the covers of Doctor Who novels, novelisations and videos. Career Doctor Who Pearson was born on the Isle of Wight. While still a student, he sent sample covers to Target Books, the publishers of Doctor Who novelisations. His first published work (an illustration for 1984's Doctor Who: The Key to Time by Peter Haining) was commissioned while he was still at school. Pearson went to art college, left after only one term, and spent the next three years submitting Doctor Who covers to then Target editor Nigel Robinson and art director Mike Brett. His first cover commission was for the novelisation of The Underwater Menace. Pearson went on to produce many more novelisation covers, including first edition covers for all of the seventh Doctor adaptations (excluding Time and the Rani for which he later supplied a reprint cover) and a number of first and second Doctor covers such as the first edition of The Edge of Destruction. Pearson continued to create covers for Target, including new covers for reprints of Doctor Who novels - some using artwork originally painted for the BBC Video releases - including An Unearthly Child and The War Games. When the novelisation line ended, Pearson was commissioned to create covers for the Doctor Who Missing Adventures; Pearson provided 22 of 33 covers for this novel line, working from the series' inception until Virgin lost the Doctor Who publishing licence in 1997. Pearson's Doctor Who work was not limited to books. From 1986 to 1993, he provided covers and fold-out posters for Doctor Who Magazine and Doctor Who Classic Comics. He also produced sixteen covers for BBC Video VHS releases of Doctor Who serials. In 2005, Pearson provided a frontispiece for Panini Books' Doctor Who Annual 2006. The next year, he created a cover for the same publisher's Doctor Who Storybook 2007, and other covers the following years for Doctor Who Storybook 2008 and Doctor Who Storybook 2009. Other Work Between 1993 and 1995, Pearson also provided twelve covers for Titan Books' \\"Star Trek Adventures\\" line. There were reprints of Star Trek novels originally released by Bantam Books. In 2007 Alister Pearson illustrated the cover for The England Quiz Book which was compiled by his old friend and fellow Doctor Who buff, Adam David Pearson (no relation) who also lives on the Isle of Wight.

Each of the simple machines (pulley, lever, wheel, incline) changes the mechanical advantage of the overall machine relative to the weight. Stack machines The weight stack from a cable machine: each plate weighs 6 kg. A stack machine --also called a stack or rack--has a set of rectangular plates that are pierced by a vertical bar which has holes drilled in it to accept a pin. Each of the plates has a channel on its underside (or a hole through the middle, as visible in the picture) that aligns with one of the holes. When the pin is inserted through the channel into the hole, all of the plates above the pin rest upon it, and are lifted when the bar rises. The plates below do not rise. This allows the same machine to provide several levels of resistance over the same range of motion with an adjustment that requires very little force to accomplish in itself. The means of lifting the bar varies. Some machines have a roller at the top of the bar that sits on a lever. When the lever is raised the bar can go up and the roller moves along the lever, allowing the bar to stay vertical. On some machines the bar is attached to a hinge on the lever, which causes swaying in the bar and the plates as the lever goes up and down. On other machines the bar is attached to a cable or belt, which runs through pulleys or over a wheel. The other end of the cable will either be a handle or strap that the user holds or wraps around some body part, or will be attached to a lever, adding further simple machines to the mechanical chain. Usually, each plate is marked with a number. On some machines these numbers give the actual weight of the plate and those above it. On some, the number gives the force at the user's actuation point with the machine. And on some machines the number is simply an index counting the number of plates being lifted. The early Nautilus machines were a combination of lever and cable machines. They also had optional, fixed elements such as a chinning bar. Universal Gym Equipment pioneered the multi-station style of machines.https://articles.latimes.com/2004/sep/24/local/me-zinkin24 Plate- loaded machines Plate-loaded machines (such as the Smith machine or sled- type leg press) use standard barbell plates instead of captive stacks of plates. They combine a bar-end on which to hang the plates with a number of simple machines to convey the force to the user. The plate-loaded machines will often have a very high mechanical advantage, due to the need to make room for large plates over a large range of motion following a path that causes them to converge at one end or the other. Also, the motion will generally not be vertical, and the net resistance is equal to the cosine of the angle at which it is moving relative to vertical. For example, consider an incline press machine that is a single-lever machine that has the plates halfway up the lever from the handles to the fulcrum, and begins moving the plates at a 45-degree angle from vertical. The lever will provide a leverage advantage of 2:1, and the incline will have an advantage of 1:‚àö2/2, for a net mechanical advantage of . Thus () of plates will apply to the user only an equaling weight of or a force of at the beginning of the motion. On the other end of the spectrum may be a bent-over-row machine that is designed with the user's grip between the plates and the fulcrum. This amplifies the force needed by the user relative to the weight of the plates.

Generally, companies report income before tax to their shareholder under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, companies report income before tax to their government under tax law. As a result, the computation of the tax expense is considerably more complex. Tax law may provide for different treatment (from GAAP) of items of income and expenses as a result of tax policy. The differences may be of permanent or temporary nature. Permanent items are in the form of non taxable income and non taxable expenses. Things such as expenses considered not deductible by taxing authorities (\\"add backs\\"), the range of tax rates applicable to various levels of income, different tax rates in different jurisdictions, multiple layers of tax on income, and other issues. For example, a government trying to promote savings may exempt interest income from tax or provide a lower rate for long term investments -such as capital gains. Conversely, a government trying to balance its foreign trade may disallow the deduction of international travel expenses or purchases made abroad. An example of temporary items may be depreciation expense; sometimes governments provide for \\"accelerated\\" depreciation of particular items of interest to tax policy. Another common temporary difference refers to bad debt write-off where the governments may generally have a stricter standard requiring the filing of claims in court. Historically, in many places, a revenue-expense method was used, in which the income statement was seen as primary, and the balance sheet as secondary. Under International Financial Reporting Standards, as well as many other accounting principles, tax expense is the result of computing current and deferred tax payable using the asset-liability method in which the balance sheet is seen as primary and the income statement as secondary. The approach in United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles was codified in SFAS 96 published in December 1987, and updated in February 1992 with SFAS 109, accounting for income taxes from a balance-sheet approach. See List of FASB Pronouncements. Current tax payable is computed by multiplying the taxable income number, as reported to the tax authorities, by the appropriate tax rate. As with tax expense, the computation is made more complex by the range of tax rates that are applicable to various levels of income and the various deductions and adjustments that the tax authorities allow. In the United States, the U.K. and elsewhere, companies are permitted to report one pre-tax income number (also called income before tax, profit before tax or earnings before income tax) to shareholders, and another, called taxable income, to the tax authorities. Differences between taxable income and the pre-tax income or profit number reported for financial statements are either temporary or permanent in nature. Permanent differences result when deductibility rules differ in perpetuity between accounting and tax law. Temporary differences result when the recognition of deductions for tax and accounting standards differ in their timing. The result is a gap between tax expense computed using income before tax and current tax payable computed using taxable income. This gap is known as deferred tax. If the tax expense exceeds the current tax payable then there is a deferred tax payable; if the current tax payable exceeds the tax expense then there is a deferred tax receivable. In the long run, income before tax and taxable income will likely be more similar than they are in any given period. If the one is less in earlier years, then it will be greater in later years. Deferred taxes will reverse themselves in the long run and in total will zero out, unless there is something like a change in tax rates in the intervening period. A deferred tax payable results from a tax break in the early years and will reverse itself in later years; a deferred tax receivable results from more taxes being paid in early years than the tax expense reported to shareholders and will again reverse itself in later years. The deferred tax amount is computed by estimating the amount and the timing of the reversal and multiplying that by the appropriate tax rates. For each of current tax and deferred tax, there may be elements which relate to the current accounting period (current year current tax and current year deferred tax), as well as items which relate to earlier accounting periods (strictly adjustments in respect of prior years, but often simply referred to as prior year current tax and prior year deferred tax). Typically, adjustments in respect of prior years arise because the tax calculations made for the statutory accounts (which need only be materially correct, and are prepared in a tight time frame to meet the accounts filing deadline) differ from those done for the filing of the tax return (typically done later in the year, with much greater thoroughness). This difference is therefore included in the tax expense line in the following year‚Äôs accounts. Other reasons for prior year elements to the tax expense may be where a past income tax return was re-submitted with a different tax result (either because the taxpayer elected to, or because they were forced to by a tax authority who disagreed with the original filing). In any case, having adjustments in respect of prior years is a standard part of the tax expense item, and should not be considered a misstatement in the original accounts ‚Äì the tax expense item is not being restated. In a set of statutory accounts, there will usually be a note to the accounts which provides a breakdown of the elements of the tax expense i.e. current tax (current year and prior year), deferred tax (current year and prior year). The exact disclosure requirement and format will depend on the relevant accounting standards under which the accounts were prepared (e.g. IFRS, US GAAP, UK GAAP). It may also be required to show foreign tax charges separately, so that the current tax items only relate to tax in the home country (this is the case under UK GAAP, for example). Foreign tax may also have current and prior year elements, and foreign tax may arise on the same underlying profits as domestic tax (where there is double taxation). All these factors mean that is not adequate to calculate the tax expense by simply taking the accounting profit multiplied by the tax rate.

This information describes how a signal propagates from the transmitter to the receiver and represents the combined effect of, for example, scattering, fading, and power decay with distance. The method is called Channel estimation. The CSI makes it possible to adapt transmissions to current channel conditions, which is crucial for achieving reliable communication with high data rates in multiantenna systems. CSI needs to be estimated at the receiver and usually quantized and feedback to the transmitter (although reverse-link estimation is possible in TDD systems). Therefore, the transmitter and receiver can have different CSI. The CSI at the transmitter and the CSI at the receiver are sometimes referred to as CSIT and CSIR, respectively.  Different kinds of channel state information  There are basically two levels of CSI, namely instantaneous CSI and statistical CSI. Instantaneous CSI (or short-term CSI) means that the current channel conditions are known, which can be viewed as knowing the impulse response of a digital filter. This gives an opportunity to adapt the transmitted signal to the impulse response and thereby optimize the received signal for spatial multiplexing or to achieve low bit error rates. Statistical CSI (or long-term CSI) means that a statistical characterization of the channel is known. This description can include, for example, the type of fading distribution, the average channel gain, the line-of-sight component, and the spatial correlation. As with instantaneous CSI, this information can be used for transmission optimization. The CSI acquisition is practically limited by how fast the channel conditions are changing. In fast fading systems where channel conditions vary rapidly under the transmission of a single information symbol, only statistical CSI is reasonable. On the other hand, in slow fading systems instantaneous CSI can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and used for transmission adaptation for some time before being outdated. In practical systems, the available CSI often lies in between these two levels; instantaneous CSI with some estimation/quantization error is combined with statistical information.  Mathematical description  In a narrowband flat-fading channel with multiple transmit and receive antennas (MIMO), the system is modeled as :\\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{H}\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\mathbf{n} where \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{y} and \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{x} are the receive and transmit vectors, respectively, and \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{H} and \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{n} are the channel matrix and the noise vector, respectively. The noise is often modeled as circular symmetric complex normal with :\\\\mathbf{n} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{CN}(\\\\mathbf{0},\\\\,\\\\mathbf{S}) where the mean value is zero and the noise covariance matrix \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{S} is known.  Instantaneous CSI  Ideally, the channel matrix \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{H} is known perfectly. Due to channel estimation errors, the channel information can be represented as :\\\\mbox{vec} (\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\textrm{estimate}}) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{CN}(\\\\mbox{vec}(\\\\mathbf{H}),\\\\,\\\\mathbf{R}_{\\\\textrm{error}}) where \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\textrm{estimate}} is the channel estimate and \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{R}_{\\\\textrm{error}} is the estimation error covariance matrix. The vectorization \\\\mbox{vec}() was used to achieve the column stacking of \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{H}, as multivariate random variables are usually defined as vectors.  Statistical CSI  In this case, the statistics of \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{H} are known. In a Rayleigh fading channel, this corresponds to knowing that :\\\\mbox{vec} (\\\\mathbf{H}) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{CN}(\\\\mathbf{0},\\\\,\\\\mathbf{R}) for some known channel covariance matrix \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{R}.  Estimation of CSI  Since the channel conditions vary, instantaneous CSI needs to be estimated on a short-term basis. A popular approach is so-called training sequence (or pilot sequence), where a known signal is transmitted and the channel matrix \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{H} is estimated using the combined knowledge of the transmitted and received signal. Let the training sequence be denoted \\\\mathbf{p}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{p}_N, where the vector \\\\mathbf{p}_i is transmitted over the channel as :\\\\mathbf{y}_i = \\\\mathbf{H}\\\\mathbf{p}_i + \\\\mathbf{n}_i. By combining the received training signals \\\\mathbf{y}_i for i=1,\\\\ldots,N, the total training signalling becomes :\\\\mathbf{Y}=[\\\\mathbf{y}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{y}_N] = \\\\mathbf{H}\\\\mathbf{P} + \\\\mathbf{N} with the training matrix \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{P}=[\\\\mathbf{p}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{p}_N] and the noise matrix \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{N}=[\\\\mathbf{n}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{n}_N]. With this notation, channel estimation means that \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{H} should be recovered from the knowledge of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{Y} and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{P}.  Least-square estimation  If the channel and noise distributions are unknown, then the least-square estimator (also known as the minimum-variance unbiased estimator) is :\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\textrm{LS-estimate}} = \\\\mathbf{Y} \\\\mathbf{P}^H(\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\mathbf{P}^H)^{-1} where ()^H denotes the conjugate transpose. The estimation Mean Square Error (MSE) is proportional to :\\\\mathrm{tr} (\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\mathbf{P}^H)^{-1} where \\\\mathrm{tr} denotes the trace. The error is minimized when \\\\mathbf{P} \\\\mathbf{P}^H is a scaled identity matrix. This can only be achieved when N is equal to (or larger than) the number of transmit antennas. The simplest example of an optimal training matrix is to select \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{P} as a (scaled) identity matrix of the same size that the number of transmit antennas.  MMSE estimation  If the channel and noise distributions are known, then this a priori information can be exploited to decrease the estimation error. This approach is known as Bayesian estimation and for Rayleigh fading channels it exploits that :\\\\mbox{vec} (\\\\mathbf{H}) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{CN}(0,\\\\,\\\\mathbf{R}), \\\\quad \\\\mbox{vec}(\\\\mathbf{N}) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{CN}(0,\\\\,\\\\mathbf{S}). The MMSE estimator is the Bayesian counterpart to the least-square estimator and becomes :\\\\mbox{vec}(\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\textrm{MMSE-estimate}}) = \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{R}^{-1} + (\\\\mathbf{P}^T \\\\, \\\\otimes\\\\, \\\\mathbf{I})^H \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1} (\\\\mathbf{P}^T \\\\, \\\\otimes\\\\, \\\\mathbf{I}) \\\\right)^{-1} (\\\\mathbf{P}^T \\\\, \\\\otimes\\\\, \\\\mathbf{I})^H \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1} \\\\mbox{vec}(\\\\mathbf{Y}) where \\\\otimes denotes the Kronecker product and the identity matrix \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{I} has the dimension of the number of receive antennas. The estimation Mean Square Error (MSE) is : \\\\mathrm{tr} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{R}^{-1} + (\\\\mathbf{P}^T \\\\, \\\\otimes\\\\, \\\\mathbf{I})^H \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1} (\\\\mathbf{P}^T \\\\, \\\\otimes\\\\, \\\\mathbf{I}) \\\\right)^{-1} and is minimized by a training matrix \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{P} that in general can only be derived through numerical optimization. But there exist heuristic solutions with good performance based on waterfilling. As opposed to least- square estimation, the estimation error for spatially correlated channels can be minimized even if N is smaller than the number of transmit antennas. Thus, MMSE estimation can both decrease the estimation error and shorten the required training sequence. It needs however additionally the knowledge of the channel correlation matrix \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{R} and noise correlation matrix \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{S}. In absence of an accurate knowledge of these correlation matrices, robust choices need to be made to avoid MSE degradation.  Data-aided versus blind estimation  In a data-aided approach, the channel estimation is based on some known data, which is known both at the transmitter and at the receiver, such as training sequences or pilot data. In a blind approach, the estimation is based only on the received data, without any known transmitted sequence. The tradeoff is the accuracy versus the overhead. A data-aided approach requires more bandwidth or it has a higher overhead than a blind approach, but it can achieve a better channel estimation accuracy than a blind estimator.

History The region of the Mondseeland, in which Mondsee is located, was formerly part of Bavaria. In 748 Mondsee Abbey was founded by Odilo, Duke of Bavaria. The abbey tradition was that the first monks came from Monte Cassino in Italy. In 788, after the fall of Duke Tassilo III, Mondsee became an Imperial abbey and over the centuries acquired extensive property. Around 800 the Codex Millenarius, an illustrated Latin book of the Gospels was written at the abbey. In 831 King Louis the Pious gave the monastery to Regensburg Cathedral. It was not until 1142 that it regained its independence, under Abbot Conrad II, otherwise Blessed Conrad of Mondsee. Conrad,born near Trier as Conrad Bosinlother formerly a monk of Siegburg Abbey, had been abbot of Mondsee since 1127, and was extremely successful in defending and regaining the rights and possessions of the monastery, to the extent that in 1145 he was murdered by a group of nobles at Oberwang nearby. He was venerated as a martyr and declared Blessed. Conrad was succeeded as abbot by Blessed Walter of Mondsee (died 17 May 1158), long remembered as a model by the community for his exemplary striving after virtue. He was buried in St. Peter's chapel in the abbey church. In 1506 possession of the Mondseeland passed from Bavaria to Austria. In 1514 Abbot Wolfgang Haberl established the abbey grammar school. After a period of decline during the Reformation and the consequent disturbances, the abbey entered a new period of prosperity. Under Abbot Bernhard Lidl (1727‚Äì73) and especially in connection with the celebration of the thousandth anniversary of the foundation, there was extensive re-building of the church and the monastic premises. From 1773 the abbot was Opportunus II Dunkl, who was the last abbot of Mondsee: in 1791 the abbey was dissolved by Emperor Leopold II. From 1625 until its dissolution the abbey was a member of the Benedictine Austrian Congregation. During the Napoleonic period the Mondseeland reverted to Bavaria for a few years. During that time, in 1810, the Bavarian Field Marshal Prince Karl Philipp von Wrede acquired the abandoned monastery (along with the nearby abbeys of Suben and Gleink), and used it as a castle. Wrede remained the owner even after the return of the territory to Austria and significantly developed the locality, for example by the construction of roads and the establishment of local cheese production. In 1905, on the death of Princess Ignazia von Wrede, Mondsee passed to the Counts Almeida, whose descendants sold it in 1985.

The response values are placed in a vector \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\left( y_{1}, \\\\dots, y_{n} \\\\right)^{\\\\mathsf{T}}, and the predictor values are placed in the design matrix \\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{x}_{1}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}, \\\\dots, \\\\mathbf{x}_{n}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\right)^{\\\\mathsf{T}}, where \\\\mathbf{x}_{i} = \\\\left( 1, x_{i2}, \\\\dots, x_{ik} \\\\right) is a vector of the k predictor variables (including a constant) for the ith unit. The model forces the conditional mean of \\\\mathbf{y} given \\\\mathbf{X} to be a linear function of \\\\mathbf{X}, and assumes the conditional variance of the error term given \\\\mathbf{X} is a known nonsingular covariance matrix \\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}. This is usually written as : \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta} + \\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}, \\\\qquad \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\varepsilon\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{X}]=0,\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Cov}[\\\\varepsilon\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{X}]= \\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}. Here \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^k is a vector of unknown constants (known as ‚Äúregression coefficients‚Äù) that must be estimated from the data. Suppose \\\\mathbf{b} is a candidate estimate for \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta}. Then the residual vector for \\\\mathbf{b} will be \\\\mathbf{y}- \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{b}. The generalized least squares method estimates \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta} by minimizing the squared Mahalanobis length of this residual vector: : \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\beta}} = \\\\underset{b}\\\\operatorname{arg min}\\\\,(\\\\mathbf{y}- \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{b})^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{y}- \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{b}), Since the objective is a quadratic form in \\\\mathbf{b}, the estimator has an explicit formula: : \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\beta}} = \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{X}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\mathbf{X}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{y}.  Properties  The GLS estimator is unbiased, consistent, efficient, and asymptotically normal with \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\hat\\\\beta\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{X}] = \\\\beta and \\\\operatorname{Cov}[\\\\hat{\\\\beta}\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{X}] = (\\\\mathbf{X}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\Omega^{-1}\\\\mathbf{X})^{-1}. GLS is equivalent to applying ordinary least squares to a linearly transformed version of the data. To see this, factor \\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega} = \\\\mathbf{C} \\\\mathbf{C}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}, for instance using the Cholesky decomposition. Then if we pre-multiply both sides of the equation \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta} + \\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon} by \\\\mathbf{C}^{-1}, we get an equivalent linear model \\\\mathbf{y}^{*} = \\\\mathbf{X}^{*} \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta} + \\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}^{*} where \\\\mathbf{y}^{*} = \\\\mathbf{C}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{y}, \\\\mathbf{X}^{*} = \\\\mathbf{C}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{X}, and \\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}^{*} = \\\\mathbf{C}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}. In this model \\\\operatorname{Var}[\\\\varepsilon^{*}\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{X}]= \\\\mathbf{C}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{C}^{-1} \\\\right)^{\\\\mathsf{T}} = \\\\mathbf{I}, where \\\\mathbf{I} is the identity matrix. Thus we can efficiently estimate \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta} by applying OLS to the transformed data, which requires minimizing : \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{y}^{*} - \\\\mathbf{X}^{*} \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta} \\\\right)^{\\\\mathsf{T}} (\\\\mathbf{y}^{*} - \\\\mathbf{X}^{*} \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta}) = (\\\\mathbf{y}- \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{b})^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{y}- \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{b}). This has the effect of standardizing the scale of the errors and ‚Äúde-correlating‚Äù them. Since OLS is applied to data with homoscedastic errors, the Gauss‚ÄìMarkov theorem applies, and therefore the GLS estimate is the best linear unbiased estimator for Œ≤.  Weighted least squares  A special case of GLS called weighted least squares (WLS) occurs when all the off-diagonal entries of Œ© are 0. This situation arises when the variances of the observed values are unequal (i.e. heteroscedasticity is present), but where no correlations exist among the observed variances. The weight for unit i is proportional to the reciprocal of the variance of the response for unit i., chapter 3  Feasible generalized least squares  If the covariance of the errors \\\\Omega is unknown, one can get a consistent estimate of \\\\Omega , say \\\\widehat \\\\Omega ,Baltagi, B. H. (2008). Econometrics (4th ed.). New York: Springer. using an implementable version of GLS known as the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimator. In FGLS, modeling proceeds in two stages: (1) the model is estimated by OLS or another consistent (but inefficient) estimator, and the residuals are used to build a consistent estimator of the errors covariance matrix (to do so, one often needs to examine the model adding additional constraints, for example if the errors follow a time series process, a statistician generally needs some theoretical assumptions on this process to ensure that a consistent estimator is available); and (2) using the consistent estimator of the covariance matrix of the errors, one can implement GLS ideas. Whereas GLS is more efficient than OLS under heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation, this is not true for FGLS. The feasible estimator is, provided the errors covariance matrix is consistently estimated, asymptotically more efficient, but for a small or medium size sample, it can be actually less efficient than OLS. This is why, some authors prefer to use OLS, and reformulate their inferences by simply considering an alternative estimator for the variance of the estimator robust to heteroscedasticity or serial autocorrelation. But for large samples FGLS is preferred over OLS under heteroskedasticity or serial correlation. Greene, W. H. (2003). Econometric Analysis (5th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.A cautionary note is that the FGLS estimator is not always consistent. One case in which FGLS might be inconsistent is if there are individual specific fixed effects. In general this estimator has different properties than GLS. For large samples (i.e., asymptotically) all properties are (under appropriate conditions) common with respect to GLS, but for finite samples the properties of FGLS estimators are unknown: they vary dramatically with each particular model, and as a general rule their exact distributions cannot be derived analytically. For finite samples, FGLS may be even less efficient than OLS in some cases. Thus, while GLS can be made feasible, it is not always wise to apply this method when the sample is small. A method sometimes used to improve the accuracy of the estimators in finite samples is to iterate, i.e. taking the residuals from FGLS to update the errors covariance estimator, and then updating the FGLS estimation, applying the same idea iteratively until the estimators vary less than some tolerance. But this method does not necessarily improve the efficiency of the estimator very much if the original sample was small. A reasonable option when samples are not too large is to apply OLS, but throwing away the classical variance estimator : \\\\sigma^2*(X'X)^{-1} (which is inconsistent in this framework) and using a HAC (Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent) estimator. For example, in autocorrelation context we can use the Bartlett estimator (often known as Newey-West estimator since these authors popularized the use of this estimator among econometricians in their 1987 Econometrica article), and in heteroskedastic context we can use the Eicker‚ÄìWhite estimator. This approach is much safer, and it is the appropriate path to take unless the sample is large, and \\"large\\" is sometimes a slippery issue (e.g. if the errors distribution is asymmetric the required sample would be much larger). The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator is calculated as usual by : \\\\widehat \\\\beta_\\\\text{OLS} = (X' X)^{-1} X' y and estimates of the residuals \\\\widehat{u}_j= (Y-X\\\\widehat\\\\beta_\\\\text{OLS})_j are constructed. For simplicity consider the model for heteroskedastic errors. Assume that the variance- covariance matrix \\\\Omega of the error vector is diagonal, or equivalently that errors from distinct observations are uncorrelated. Then each diagonal entry may be estimated by the fitted residuals \\\\widehat{u}_j so \\\\widehat{\\\\Omega}_{OLS} may be constructed by : \\\\widehat{\\\\Omega}_\\\\text{OLS} = \\\\operatorname{diag}(\\\\widehat{\\\\sigma}^2_1, \\\\widehat{\\\\sigma}^2_2, \\\\dots , \\\\widehat{\\\\sigma}^2_n). It is important to notice that the squared residuals cannot be used in the previous expression; we need an estimator of the errors variances. To do so, we can use a parametric heteroskedasticity model, or a nonparametric estimator. Once this step is fulfilled, we can proceed: Estimate \\\\beta_{FGLS1} using \\\\widehat{\\\\Omega}_\\\\text{OLS} using weighted least squares : \\\\widehat \\\\beta_{FGLS1} = (X'\\\\widehat{\\\\Omega}^{-1}_\\\\text{OLS} X)^{-1} X' \\\\widehat{\\\\Omega}^{-1}_\\\\text{OLS} y The procedure can be iterated. The first iteration is given by : \\\\widehat{u}_{FGLS1} = Y - X \\\\widehat \\\\beta_{FGLS1} : \\\\widehat{\\\\Omega}_{FGLS1} = \\\\operatorname{diag}(\\\\widehat{\\\\sigma}^2_{FGLS1,1}, \\\\widehat{\\\\sigma}^2_{FGLS1,2}, \\\\dots ,\\\\widehat{\\\\sigma}^2_{FGLS1,n}) : \\\\widehat \\\\beta_{FGLS2} = (X'\\\\widehat{\\\\Omega}^{-1}_{FGLS1} X)^{-1} X' \\\\widehat{\\\\Omega}^{-1}_{FGLS1} y This estimation of \\\\widehat{\\\\Omega} can be iterated to convergence. Under regularity conditions any of the FGLS estimator (or that of any of its iterations, if we iterate a finite number of times) is asymptotically distributed as : \\\\sqrt{n}(\\\\hat\\\\beta_{FGLS} - \\\\beta)\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{d}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{N}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(0,\\\\,V\\\\right). where n is the sample size and : V = \\\\operatorname{p-lim}(X'\\\\Omega^{-1}X/T) here p-lim means limit in probability  See also  * Confidence region * Effective degrees of freedom  References   Further reading   * Category:Least squares ","title":"Generalized least squares"},{"id":"4504139","text":"The Halk Maslahaty (–•–∞–ª–∫ –ú–∞—Å–ª–∞—Ö–∞—Ç—ã [x…ëlq m…ëŒ∏l…ëx…ëtÃ™…Ø]; \\"People's Council\\") was the highest representative body in Turkmenistan (Article 45 of the 1992 Constitution). It was abolished in the new constitution of 2008. Before 1991, it was known as the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR. The council had 2,507 members, some of whom were elected. All candidates at the elections of 7 April 2003 (turnout 89.3%) belonged to the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan. Like the Assembly of Turkmenistan (the parliament), it was led by the President, who was constitutionally the head of both the legislative and the executive branches of government. Turkmenistan's administration was based on Halk Maslahatys on different levels. Each province (wela√Ωat) of Turkmenistan has its own, 80-member wela√Ωat halk maslahaty, whose members are elected directly in constituencies. Their influence is fairly limited even on paper and probably even more so in practice, taking into account that Turkmenistan is a dominant-party state ruled mostly by its president. On lower administrative levels, district and city halk maslahatys exist. The Halk Maslahaty system was abolished when President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow introduced a new constitution in 2008, its powers being returned to the Assembly and the President. In October 2017, President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov reorganized the Council of Elders into a new People's Council.

Jan August (born Jan Auggustoff; September, 24 1904 ‚Äì January, 9 1976) was an American pianist and xylophonist. He had a hit with his version of \\"Misirlou\\" in 1947 with Carl Frederick Tandberg. August was born in New York City. He was self-taught and began his career at age 17 in Greenwich Village, had hits with several other songs that blended classical styles and Latin beats. He was discovered in 1946 in a New York City nightclub by an executive for Diamond Records. The executive was so eager to have August with his label, he wrote the recording contract on one of the club's tablecloths. Early in his career August recorded on the Diamond label (\\"Misirlou\\" is on his album Piano Magic for Diamond). He played his hit for the Press Photographers' Ball in Washington, DC, in 1947, and in turn, Harry Truman responded by playing the \\"Missouri Waltz\\" for August. In the early 1950s he was recording on Mercury; one notable Mercury side is a swinging and thoughtful arrangement of \\"Hot Lips\\". Later LP albums demonstrated a shift away from August's distinctive earlier style, toward the semi-satirical \\"honky-tonk\\" style of the late 50s personified by such artists as Joe \\"Fingers\\" Carr. In 1974, a musician calling himself Jan August played an extended engagement at St. Petersburg's La Ronda restaurant. When a newspaper reporter for the St. Petersburg Times went to see him perform, she realized he did not look like Jan August and had a different musical style. She became suspicious and traced August through the musicians' union in New York City. August declined pressing charges, but indicated that his name could no longer be used by the other musician. August died in New York City of heart disease at age 71, and was survived by his wife, Bette, three daughters and six grandchildren.

He was the father of Luce Fabbri. Fabbri was first sentenced for anarchist activities at the age of 16 in Ancona, and spent many years in and out of Italian prisons. Fabbri was a long time and prolific contributor to the anarchist press in Europe and later South America, including co-editing, along with Errico Malatesta, the paper L'Agitazione. He helped edit the paper \\"Universit√† popolare\\" in Milan. Fabbri was a delegate to the International Anarchist Congress held in Amsterdam in 1907. He died in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1935. He was the author of: Dictatorship and Revolution (Dettadura e Rivoluzione), a response to Lenin's work The State and the Revolution; Malatesta's Life, translated by Adam Wight (originally published in 1936), this book was published again with expanded content in 1945. He also wrote other political books. In Uruguay, he dedicated himself to school and secondary education, maintaining his ideas. He was the father of the Uruguayan anarchist and educator Luce Fabbri.  Biography  Fabbri was born in Fabriano, in the province of Ancona, on 23 December 1877 to Curzio Fabbri and Angela Sbriccioli. While still a student at the Technical Institute of Ancona, he embraced anarchist ideals, under the influence of Virgilio Condulmari, a shoemaker from Recanati. On June 9, 1894, he was arrested and sentenced to 25 days in prison for participating in an anarchist demonstration. He enrolled as a law student at the University of Macerata and started to collaborate on a number of the anarchist periodicals including The Thought of Chieti, The Human Protest of Tunis, The Social Future of Messina and L'Agitazione of Ancona. In 1897 he met Errico Malatesta. On 10 May 1898 he was arrested again and sent to confinement, first on the island of Ponza and then in Favignana. Released on October 17, 1900, he dropped out of school and moved to Rome, founding the theoretical magazine Il Pensiero with Pietro Gori in 1903. After taking part, on September 20, 1904, in the International Congress of Free Thought, he went to France to contact the major exponents of anarchism, in order to encourage the revival of political organization at an international level. He saw S√©bastien Faure, Jean Grave, L√©on Jouhaux, Charles Malato, Jacques Mesnil, Pierre Monatte, and met with Malatesta in London. On June 16, 1907, at the Italian Anarchist Congress, Fabbri proposed the coordination of the numerous anarchist groups operating in Italy. Two months later, on August 21, the International Anarchist Congress was held in Amsterdam. The Italian delegates to both this and the international anti-militarist congress were Fabbri, Malatesta and Aristide Ceccarelli. In 1908 translations of his writings appeared in Spain and Germany, Syndicalism and Anarchism, where Fabbri notes the resemblances of anarchism with revolutionary syndicalism, and Marxism and Anarchism, in which he distinguishes anarchism from Marxist socialism. The following year he settled in Bologna, where he joined the Chamber of Labor and became secretary of the Bolognese metallurgical union. During this time, Fabbri married Bianca Sbriccoli, with whom he had the children Luce and Vero. In May 1909, the congress of revolutionary trade unionists was held in Bologna, which decided by a large majority to join the reformist General Confederation of Labour, in an attempt to bring a revolutionary change to the Bolognese union. This initiative was imitated throughout Italy, but it was short-lived, because, on November 23, 1912, revolutionary anarchists and syndicalists left the CGL, instead founding the USI, the Italian Syndicalist Union, a choice approved by Fabbri. In 1913, he moved back to Ancona, where with Errico Malatesta he founded the magazine Volont√† and published the Letters to a socialist, a strenuous criticism of the parliamentarianism promoted by the Italian Socialist Party, and The conscious generation, in support of birth control. In June 1914, Fabbri was among the protagonists of the Red Week and was forced to flee to Lugano, Switzerland, in order to escape arrest. In December of the same year, he took a merchant ship to the south of Italy, traveled the entire length peninsula and appeared in Genoa, hailed by the crowd as a revolutionary leader, a role he always refused to assume, due to his libertarian ideological convictions. He fought vehemently against any form of interventionism in World War I, sparing no criticism even to those anarchists, such as Peter Kropotkin, who had declared themselves in support of the imperialist forces engaged in the conflict. In the wake of the October Revolution, the Italian Anarchist Union was founded. In this new organization, Fabbri and Malatesta attempted to reconcile traditional anarchist individualism with the organizational structure of the Union, trying to \\"find a formula that would allow the maximum performance of each individual, allowing greater autonomy and greater elasticity\\". The anarchists had an important role during the Biennio Rosso of 1919-1920. On February 26, 1920, Umanit√† Nova was founded by Malatesta. Fabbri collaborated on this newspaper, in 1921 he published Dictatorship and Revolution, a collection of his articles where he expressed his criticism of the new Soviet state and the Marxist principle of dictatorship of the proletariat. Fabbri, through his writing, encouraged workers to continue the occupation of their factories, while Malatesta went to the factories in Rome, to personally try to continue the movement. Fabbri, at that point, was already very pessimistic, and thought that the revolutionary moment had already passed. Although he wanted to take advantage of every last opportunity, he did not believe that the outcome was favorable to the anarchists. Reflecting on the causes of the defeat, Fabbri wrote: Despite massive demonstrations, clashes with the police, and the seizure of factories by the Italian proletariat, there was no proletarian revolution in Italy, but instead there was \\"a real preventive counter- revolution, of which fascism was the most active and impressive factor\\". Fabbri began to have great difficulties in Italy from the rise to power of Benito Mussolini in 1922, being arrested twice. The situation became very difficult for all anarchists living under the fascist regime. In any case, during the first years of fascism, propaganda continued, albeit in a very limited capacity: the Malatesta newspaper Pensiero e Volont√° was founded in 1924, but was suspended shortly thereafter. Umanit√° Nova also met with difficulties, when it was not prohibited outright. Fabbri was a primary school teacher, and continued to teach for over 4 years. In 1926 it became mandatory for teachers to swear allegiance to the fascist regime, which Fabbri refused, in keeping with his moral and political principles. He crossed the border into France, separating himself from his family. His son and wife went to Rome to work, while their daughter remained in Bologna for two years. Later, his wife and daughter met Fabbri in France, but their son remained in the Italian capital, and they never saw each other again. Under pressure from the Italian embassy, France threatened Fabbri with expulsion. While diplomatic procedures were being carried out, the police detained him at his hotel and deposited him at the border with Belgium, clandestinely passing him across the border, so as not to be detained by the Belgian authorities that would just send him back to France. Once in Brussels, he began to prepare a trip to South America, traveling by boat with his family to Uruguay. In 1929 he reached Uruguay with his family, in Montevideo he became director of the Italian school, but following the protests of the fascist regime he was fired. Fabbri moved to Buenos Aires and continued his collaboration on the anarchist newspaper The Protest. He devoted himself more fully to journalistic activity in the Rio Plata region, where he dealt with the political and trade union problems of the local workers' movement, in which there was a strong anarchist presence. He also worked as a teacher, although the editors of The Protest helped him financially. But on September 6, 1930, a military coup by Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu ended the democratic government of Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen, and prohibited all worker activity, and especially persecuted the anarchists. The Protest was closed and their offices and printing press were destroyed. Luigi Fabbri moved to Uruguay, where he lived his last years. In 1935, Luigi Fabbri died while he edited a book on Errico Malatesta's writings and life. Published works *Life of Malatesta, translated by Adam Wight (originally published 1936).

History  Microchip Technology was founded in 1987 when General Instrument spun off its microelectronics division as a wholly owned subsidiary. The newly formed company was a supplier of programmable non-volatile memory, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, card chip on board, and consumer integrated circuits. An initial public offering later in the year was canceled because of the October 1987 stock market crash. Microchip Technology became an independent company in 1989 when it was acquired by a group of venture capitalists led by Sequoia Capital. In the same year, Microchip Technology announced the release of small, inexpensive 8-bit reduced instruction set computing (RISC) microcontrollers for $2.40 apiece whereas most RISC microcontrollers were 32-bit devices selling for hundreds of dollars. In 1990, 60% of Microchip Technology's sales were from the disc drive industry and the product portfolio relied heavily on commodity EEPROM products. The company was losing $2.5 million per quarter, had less than 6 months of cash in reserve, had exhausted lines of credit, and was failing to control expenses. Early in the year, the venture capital investors accepted an offer to sell Microchip Technology to Winbond Electronics Corporation of Taiwan for $15 million. Winbond Electronics backed out of the deal after the Taiwanese stock market decrease in May 1990. Vice President of Operations, Steve Sanghi, was named president and chief operating officer of Microchip Technology in 1990. After several quarters of losses, Sanghi oversaw Microchip Technology's transition from selling commodity-based products to specialized chips, such as the RISC technology. Microchip Technology conducted an IPO in 1993, which Fortune magazine cited as the best performing IPO of the year with a stock appreciation of 500% and over $1 billion in market capitalization. At the end of 2015, Microchip Technology posted its 100th consecutive quarter of profitability.

The term also describes several modern Turko-Mongolic native religious movements and teachings. It was the prevailing religion of the Turks, Mongols (including Bulgars and Xiongnu), Huns, and, possibly, the Manchus and Magyars, and the state religion of several medieval states: G√∂kt√ºrk Khaganate, Western Turkic Khaganate, Eastern Turkic Khaganate, Old Great Bulgaria, Danube Bulgaria, Volga Bulgaria, and Eastern Tourkia (Khazaria). In Irk Bitig, a ninth century manuscript on divination, Tengri is mentioned as (God of Turks). According to many academics, at the imperial level, especially by the 12th‚Äì13th centuries, Tengrism was monotheistic, and many contemporary Tengrists identify as monotheist. Peak of Khan Tengri at sunset. The forms of the name Tengri () among the ancient and modern Turks and Mongols are Tengeri, Tangara, Tangri, Tanri, Tangre, Tegri, Tingir, Tenkri, Teri, Ter, and Ture. The name Tengri (\\"the Sky\\") is derived from (\\"daybreak\\") or Tan (\\"dawn\\"). Meanwhile, Stefan Georg proposed that the Turkic Tengri ultimately originates as a loanword from Proto-Yeniseian *t…®≈ãgVr- \\"high\\".Georg, Stefan (2001): T√ºrkisch/Mongolisch tengri ‚ÄúHimmel/Gott‚Äù und seine Herkunft. Studia Etymologica Cracoviensia 6: 83‚Äì100. Mongolia is sometimes poetically called the \\"Land of Eternal Blue Sky\\" () by its inhabitants. Tengrism has been advocated in intellectual circles of the Turkic nations of Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan with Kazakhstan) and Russia (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan) since the dissolution of the Soviet Union during the 1990s. Still practiced, it is undergoing an organized revival in Buryatia, Sakha (Yakutia), Khakassia, Tuva and other Turkic nations in Siberia. Altaian Burkhanism and Chuvash Vattisen Yaly are movements similar to Tengrism. Terminology and relationship with shamanism The word \\"Tengrism\\" is a fairly new term. The spelling Tengrism for the religion of the ancient Turks is found in the works of the 19th century Kazakh Russophone ethnographer Shoqan Walikhanov. The term was introduced into a wide scientific circulation in 1956 by Jean-Paul Roux and later in the 1960s as a term of English-language papers.E.g., Bergounioux (ed.), Primitive and prehistoric religions, Vol. 140, Hawthorn Books, 1966, p. 80. Tengrianism is a reflection of the Russian term, ' (\\"Tengri√°nstvo\\"). It is introduced by Kazakh poet and turkologist Olzhas Suleymenov in his 1975-year book AZ-and-IA. Since the 1990s, Russian-language literature uses it in the general sense, as for instance, reported in 1996 (\\"so-called Tengrianism\\") in the context of the nationalist rivalry over Bulgar legacy. The spellings Tengriism, Tangrism, Tengrianity are also found from the 1990s. In modern Turkey and, partly, Kyrgyzstan, Tengrism is known as the ' or (\\"Sky God religion\\"); the Turkish (sky) and (God) correspond to the Mongolian (blue) and (sky), respectively. Mongolian ' is used in a 1999 biography of Genghis Khan.Boldbaatar et. al, , , 1999, [ p. 18]. In the 20th century, a number of scientists established the existence of a religious imperial khagan cult in the ancient Turkic and Mongolian states. The Turkish historian of religion Ziya G√∂kalp (1876‚Äì1924) wrote in his The History of Turkish Holy Tradition and Turkish Civilization that the religion of the ancient Turkic states could not be primitive shamanism, which was only a magical part of the religion of the ancient T√ºrks (see a historiography of the problem: ). The nature of this religion remains debatable. According to many scholars, it was monotheistic with the god K√∂k-Tengri as the Supreme Being‚Äîan idea originally inspired by proponents of primitive monotheism, and later supported by a number of other academics (W. Schmidt; R. Pettazzoni; L. Gumilyov; G. Doerfer; H. Tanyu; and others). As a variant of this concept, Tengrism was a monotheistic religion only at the imperial level in aristocratic circles (among the Old Turks were two types of religions: shamanism and Tengri-centered Tengrism, the first was a part of the second)Meserve, R., Religions in the central Asian environment. In: History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Vol. 4 , The age of achievement: A.D. 750 to the end of the fifteenth century, Part Two: The achievements, p. 68: *\\"The 'imperial' religion was more monotheistic, centred around the all-powerful god Tengri, the sky god.\\"Fergus, Michael; Jandosova, Janar. [ Kazakhstan: Coming of Age], Stacey International, 2003, p. 91: *\\"... a profound combination of monotheism and polytheism that has come to be known as Tengrism.\\" and, perhaps, only by the 12th-13th centuries (a late form of development of ancient shamanism in the era of the Mongol empire). As Jean-Paul Roux put it, that this was a strong idea of the Turks and Mongols: \\"As there is only one God in Heaven, there can only be one ruler on the earth ...\\" Others point out that Tengri was not an Absolute, but only a god of the upper world, sky deity, in polytheistic shamanism. All the contemporary followers of Tengrism present it as the monotheistic. The earliest known depiction of a Siberian shaman, drawn by the Dutch explorer Nicolaes Witsen, who wrote an account of his travels among Samoyedic- and Tungusic-speaking peoples in 1692. Witsen labeled the illustration as a \\"Priest of the Devil\\", giving this figure clawed feet to express what he thought were demonic qualities.Hutton 2001. p. 32. Tengrism differs from Siberian shamanism in that the polities practicing it were not small bands of hunter-gatherers like the Paleosiberians but a continuous succession of pastoral, semi-sedentarized khanates and empires from the Xiongnu Empire (founded 209 BC) to the Mongol Empire (13th century). Among Turkic peoples it was radically supplanted by Islam, while in Mongolia it survives as a synthesis with Tibetan Buddhism while surviving in purer forms around Lake Khovsgol and Lake Baikal. Unlike Siberian shamanism, which has no written tradition, Tengrism can be identified from Turkic and Mongolic historical texts like the Orkhon inscriptions, Secret History of the Mongols, and Altan Tobchi. However, these texts are more historically oriented and are not strictly religious texts like the scriptures and sutras of sedentary civilizations, which have elaborate doctrines and religious stories. On a scale of complexity Tengrism lies somewhere between the Proto-Indo-European religion (a pre-state form of pastoral shamanism on the western steppe) and its later form the Vedic religion. The eastern steppe where Tengrism developed had more centralized, hierarchical polities than the western steppe. Tengrism has been noted as more centralized, less polytheistic, less myth-intensive and more historically focused than the paganism that grew out of the western Proto-Indo-European religion. Nonetheless, the chief god Tengri (\\"Heaven\\") is considered strikingly similar to the Indo-European sky god *Dy·∏óus, and the structure of the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion is closer to that of the early Turks than to the religion of any people of Near Eastern or Mediterranean antiquity.Mircea Eliade, John C. Holt, Patterns in comparative religion, 1958, p. 94. The term \\"shamanism\\" was first applied by Western anthropologists as outside observers of the ancient religion of the Turks and Mongols, as well as those of the neighbouring Tungusic and Samoyedic-speaking peoples. Upon observing more religious traditions across the world, some Western anthropologists began to also use the term in a very broad sense. The term was used to describe unrelated magico-religious practices found within the ethnic religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and even completely unrelated parts of the Americas, as they believed these practices to be similar to one another. Khakas ethnicity. Buryat shaman performing a libation. Terms for 'shaman' and 'shamaness' in Siberian languages: *'shaman': saman (Nedigal, Nanay, Ulcha, Orok), sama (Manchu). The variant /≈°aman/ (i.e., pronounced \\"shaman\\") is Evenk (whence it was borrowed into Russian). *'shaman': alman, olman, wolmen (Yukagir) *'shaman': (Tatar, Shor, Oyrat), (Tuva, Tofalar) *The Buryat word for shaman is –±”©”© (b√∂√∂) , from early Mongolian b√∂ge. *'shaman': ≈Ñajt (Khanty, Mansi), from Proto-Uralic *nojta (cf. S√°mi noaidi) *'shamaness': (Mongol), (Yakut), udagan (Buryat), udugan (Evenki, Lamut), odogan (Nedigal). Related forms found in various Siberian languages include utagan, ubakan, utygan, ut√ºgun, iduan, or duana. All these are related to the Mongolian name of Et√ºgen, the hearth goddess, and Et√ºgen Eke 'Mother Earth'. Maria Czaplicka points out that Siberian languages use words for male shamans from diverse roots, but the words for female shaman are almost all from the same root. She connects this with the theory that women's practice of shamanism was established earlier than men's, that \\"shamans were originally female\\". Buryat scholar Irina S. Urbanaeva developed a theory of Tengrist esoteric traditions in Central Asia after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the revival of national sentiment in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia.English language discussion in Znamenski, Andrei A., Shamanism in Siberia: Russian records of indigenous spirituality, Springer, 2003, , [ pp. 350‚Äì352].

For the first time the name Tengri recorded in Chinese chronicles from the 4th century BC as the sky god of the Xiongnu, it takes the Chinese form ÊíëÁäÅ (Cheng-li). The cult of Heaven-Tengri is fixed by the Orkhon, or Old Turkic script used by the G√∂kt√ºrks (\\"celestial Turks\\") and other early khanates during the 8th to 10th centuries.

Tengrism also played a large role in the religion of Mongol Empires as the primary statespirituality. Genghis Khan and several generations of his followers were Tengrian believers and \\"Shaman-Kings\\" until his fifth- generation descendant, Uzbeg Khan, turned to Islam in the 14th century. Old Tengrist prayers have come to us from the Secret History of the Mongols (13th century). The priests-prophets (temujin) resevied them, according to faiths, from the great deity/spirit Munkh Tenger. Kyrgyz yurt in 1860 in the Syr Darya Oblast. Note the lack of a compression ring at the top. The original Mongol khans, followers of Tengri, were known for their tolerance of other religions.Osman Turan, The Ideal of World Domination among the Medieval Turks, in Studia Islamica, No. 4 (1955), pp. 77-90 M√∂ngke Khan, the fourth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, said: \\"We believe that there is only one God, by whom we live and by whom we die, and for whom we have an upright heart. But as God gives us the different fingers of the hand, so he gives to men diverse ways to approach him.\\" (\\"Account of the Mongols. Diary of William Rubruck\\", religious debate in court documented by William of Rubruck on May 31, 1254). The cult of Heaven was probably the similar with Tengrism among the Tungusic peoples, which, together with the Turks and the Mongols, belong to the hypothetical Altaic language family, especially those who had their statehood as Manchus (the sky deity in Manchu shamanism colled Apka Enduri). According to Hungarian archaeological research, the religion of the Magyars (Hungarians) until the end of the 10th century (before Christianity) was Tengrism.\\"There is no doubt that between the 6th and 9th centuries Tengrism was the religion among the nomads of the steppes\\" Yazar Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas, Hungarians and Europe in the early Middle Ages: an introduction to early Hungarian history, Yayƒ±ncƒ± Central European University Press, 1999, , [ p. 151].Istv√°n, Fodor.

Heaven, earth, spirits of nature and ancestors provide for every need and protect all humans. By living an upright, respectful life, a human will keep his world in balance and perfect his personal Wind Horse, or spirit. The Huns of the northern Caucasus reportedly believed in two gods: Tangri Han (or Tengri Khan), considered identical to the Persian EsfandiyƒÅr and for whom horses were sacrificed, and Kuar (whose victims are struck by lightning). Traditional Tengrism persists among the Mongols and in some Turko-Mongolian regions of Russia (Sakha, Buryatia, and Tuva) in parallel with other religions.Balkanlar'dan Uluƒü T√ºrkistan'a T√ºrk halk inan√ßlarƒ± Cilt 1, Ya≈üar Kalafat, Berikan, 2007 Orkhon inscriptions According to the Orkhon inscriptions, Tengri played a big role in choices of the kaghan, and in guiding his actions. Many of these were performed because \\"Heaven so ordained\\" ().Barbara Kellner-Heinkele, (1993), Altaica Berolinensia: The Concept of Sovereignty in the Altaic World, p. 249 Arghun's letters Philip the Fair, in classical Mongolian script. The letter was given to the French king by Buscarel of Gisolfe. Arghun expressed the association of Tengri with imperial legitimacy and military success. The majesty (suu) of the khan is a divine stamp granted by Tengri to a chosen individual through which Tengri controls the world order (the presence of Tengri in the khan). In this letter, \\"Tengri\\" or \\"Mongke Tengri\\" (\\"Eternal Heaven\\") is at the top of the sentence. In the middle of the magnified section, the phrase Tengri-yin Kuchin (\\"Power of Tengri\\") forms a pause before it is followed by the phrase Khagan-u Suu (\\"Majesty of the Khan\\"): 1290 letter from Arghun to Pope Nicholas IV Arghun expressed Tengrism's non-dogmatic side. The name Mongke Tengri (\\"Eternal Tengri\\") is at the top of the sentence in this letter to Pope Nicholas IV, in accordance with Mongolian Tengriist writing rules. The words \\"Tngri\\" (Tengri) and \\"zrlg\\" (zarlig, decree/order) are still written with vowel-less archaism: Tengrism in the Secret History of the Mongols Mount Burkhan Khaldun is a place where Genghis Khan regularly prayed to Tengri. Tengri is mentioned many times in the Secret History of the Mongols, written in 1240. The book starts by listing the ancestors of Genghis Khan starting from Borte Chino (Blue Wolf) born with \\"destiny from Tengri\\". Bodonchar Munkhag the 9th generation ancestor of Genghis Khan is called a \\"son of Tengri\\". When Temujin was brought to the Qongirat tribe at 9 years old to choose a wife, Dei Setsen of the Qongirat tells Yesugei the father of Temujin (Genghis Khan) that he dreamt of a white falcon, grasping the sun and the moon, come and sit on his hands. He identifies the sun and the moon with Yesugei and Temujin. Temujin then encounters Tengri in the mountains at the age of 12. The Taichiud had come for him when he was living with his siblings and mother in the wilderness, subsisting on roots, wild fruits, sparrows and fish. He was hiding in the thick forest of Terguun Heights. After three days hiding he decided to leave and was leading his horse on foot when he looked back and noticed his saddle had fallen. Temujin says \\"I can understand the belly strap can come loose, but how can the breast strap also come loose? Is Tengri persuading me?\\" He waited three more nights and decided to go out again but a tent-sized rock had blocked the way out. Again he said \\"Is Tengri persuading me?\\", returned and waited three more nights. Finally he lost patience after 9 days of hunger and went around the rock, cutting down the wood on the other side with his arrow-whittling knife, but as he came out the Taichiud were waiting for him there and promptly captured him. Toghrul later credits the defeat of the Merkits with Jamukha and Temujin to the \\"mercy of mighty Tengri\\" (paragraph 113). Khorchi of the Baarin tells Temujin of a vision given by \\"Zaarin Tengri\\" where a bull raises dust and asks for one of his horns back after charging the ger cart of Jamukha (Temujin's rival) while another ox harnessed itself to a big ger cart on the main road and followed Temujin, bellowing \\"Heaven and Earth have agreed to make Temujin the Lord of the nation and I am now carrying the nation to you\\". Temujin afterward tells his earliest companions Boorchi and Zelme that they will be appointed to the highest posts because they first followed him when he was \\"mercifully looked upon by Tengri\\" (paragraph 125). In the Battle of Khuiten, Buyuruk Khan and Quduga try using zad stones to cause a thunderstorm against Temujin but it backfires and they get stuck in slippery mud. They say \\"the wrath of Tengri is upon us\\" and flee in disorder (paragraph 143). Temujin prays to \\"father Tengri\\" on a high hill with his belt around his neck after defeating the Taichiud at Tsait Tsagaan Tal and taking 100 horses and 50 breastplates. He says \\"I haven't become Lord thanks to my own bravery, but I have defeated my enemies thanks to the love of my father mighty Tengri\\". When Nilqa Sengum the son of Toghrul Khan tries to convince him to attack Temujin, Toghrul says \\"How can I think evil of my son Temujin? If we think evil of him when he is such a critical support to us, Tengri will not be pleased with us\\". After Nilqa Sengum throws a number of tantrums Toghrul finally relents and says \\"I was afraid of Tengri and said how can I harm my son. If you are really capable, then you decide what you need to do\\". When Boorchi and Ogedei return wounded from the battle against Toghrul, Genghis Khan strikes his chest in anguish and says \\"May Eternal Tengri decide\\" (paragraph 172). Genghis Khan tells Altan and Khuchar \\"All of you refused to become Khan, that is why I led you as Khan. If you would have become Khan I would have charged first in battle and brought you the best women and horses if high Khukh Tengri showed us favor and defeated our enemies\\". After defeating the Keraits Genghis Khan says \\"By the blessing of Eternal Tengri I have brought low the Kerait nation and ascended the high throne\\" (paragraph 187). Genghis sends Subutai with an iron cart to pursue the sons of Togtoa and tells him \\"If you act exposed though hidden, near though far and maintain loyalty then Supreme Tengri will bless you and support you\\" (paragraph 199). Jamukha tells Temujin \\"I had no trustworthy friends, no talented brothers and my wife was a talker with great words. That is why I have lost to you Temujin, blessed and destined by Father Tengri.\\" Genghis Khan appoints Shikhikhutug chief judge of the Empire in 1206 and tells him \\"Be my eyes to see and ears to hear when I am ordering the empire through the blessing of Eternal Tengri\\" (paragraph 203). Genghis Khan appoints Muqali \\"Gui Wang\\" because he \\"transmitted the word of Tengri when I was sitting under the spreading tree in the valley of Khorkhunag Jubur where Hotula Khan used to dance\\" (paragraph 206). He gives Khorchi of the Baarin 30 wives because he promised Khorchi he would fulfill his request for 30 wives \\"if what you say comes true through the mercy and power of Tengri\\" (paragraph 207). Genghis mentions both Eternal Tengri and \\"heaven and earth\\" when he says \\"By the mercy of Eternal Tengri and the blessing of heaven and earth I have greatly increased in power, united all the great nation and brought them under my reins\\" (paragraph 224). Genghis orders Dorbei the Fierce of the Dorbet tribe to \\"strictly govern your soldiers, pray to Eternal Tengri and try to conquer the Khori Tumed people\\" (paragraph 240). After being insulted by Asha Khambu of the Tanguts of being a weak Khan Genghis Khan says \\"If Eternal Tengri blesses me and I firmly pull my golden reins, then things will become clear at that time\\" (paragraph 256). When Asha Khambu of the Tangut insults him again after his return from the Khwarezmian campaign Genghis Khan says \\"How can we go back (to Mongolia) when he says such proud words? Though I die I won't let these words slip. Eternal Tengri, you decide\\" (paragraph 265). After Genghis Khan \\"ascends to Tengri\\" (paragraph 268) during his successful campaign against the Tangut (Xi Xia) the wheels of the returning funeral cart gets stuck in the ground and Gilugdei Baatar of the Sunud says \\"My horse-mounted divine lord born with destiny from Khukh Tengri, have you abandoned your great nation?\\" Batu Khan sends a secret letter to Ogedei Khan saying \\"Under the power of the Eternal Tengri, under the Majesty of my uncle the Khan, we set up a great tent to feast after we had broken the city of Meged, conquered the Orosuud (Russians), brought in eleven nations from all directions and pulled on our golden reins to hold one last meeting before going our separate directions\\" (paragraph 275). Contemporary Tengrism White S√ºlde Tngri temple in the town of Uxin Banner in Inner Mongolia, China. A revival of Tengrism has played a role in search for native spiritual roots and Pan-Turkism ideology since the 1990s, especially, in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, some autonomous republics of the Russian Federation (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Buryatia, Yakutia, and others), among the Crimean Karaites and Crimean Tatars. After 1908 Young Turk Revolution, and especially the proclamation of the Republic in 1923, a nationalist idleology of Turanism and Kemalism contributed to the revival of Tengrism. Islamic censorship was abolished, which allowed an objective study of the pre- Islamic religion of the Turks. The Turkish language was purified of Arabic, Persian and other borrowings. A number of figures, if they did not officially abandon Islam, but adopted Turkic names, such as Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk (Atat√ºrk ‚Äî \\"father of Turks\\") and the historian of religion and ideologist of the Kemalist regime Ziya G√∂kalp (G√∂kalp ‚Äî \\"sky hero\\"). Nih√¢l Atsƒ±z (1905‚Äì1975), one of the first ideologists of modern Tengrism. The prominent Turkish writer and historian Nihal Atsiz was Tengrist and the ideologue of Turanism. The followers of Tengrism in the paramilitary organisation Grey Wolves, mainly inspired by his work, replace the Arabic designation of the god \\"Allah\\" with the Turkish \\"Tanri\\" in the oath and pronounce: \\"Tanrƒ± T√ºrk√º Korusun\\" (Tengri, bless the T√ºrks!). The most famous modern ideologues and theorists of Tengrism are Igor Achkinazi (1954‚Äì2006), (1944‚Äì2018), (1938‚Äì2003), , (1955‚Äì2010), Rafael Bezertinov, Shagdaryn Bira, , (1947‚Äì2018), Mongush Kenin-Lopsan, (1958‚Äì2016), Choiun Omuraliyev, (1922‚Äì2019), Dastan Sarygulov, and Olzhas Suleimenov. The poet, literary critic and Turkologist Olzhas Suleimenov, the eulogist of the Kazakh national identity, in his book AZ-and-IA that was banned after publication in 1975 in Soviet Kazakhstan, USSR, presented Tengrism (\\"Tengrianstvo\\") as one of most ancient religions in the world. Tengrism has very few active adherents, but its revival of an ethnic religion reached a larger audience in intellectual circles. Former Presidents of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev and Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev have called Tengrism the national, \\"natural\\" religion of the Turkic peoples. So, during the 2002 trip to Khakassia, Russia, Akayev spoke out that a visit to the Yenisei River and the runic steles constituted \\"a pilgrimage to a holy place for the Kyrgyz\\" just as the pilgrimage to Mecca. Presenting Islam as foreign to the Turkic peoples, as Semitic religion together with Christianity and Judaism, adherents are found primarily among the nationalistic parties of Central Asia. Tengrism may be interpreted as a Turkic version of Russian neopaganism, which is already well-established. It partly semilar to the new religious movements, such as New Age. In Tatarstan, the only Tengrist periodical Beznen-Yul (Our Path) appeared in 1997, and also works a theorist of Tengrist movement Rafael Bezertinov. He writes: > Today it‚Äôs hard to even say who the modern Turks and Mongols. Their names > are 90% Arabic, Persian, Greek, Jewish, etc; religion is Semitic (Arabic, > Christian, Jewish) and Indian; many do not know their philosophy and > traditions; live by the laws and lifestyle of the West; clothes and their > food is western; the alphabet is western; forgotten your kind and ancestors; > they do not know the history of their folk; many city residents do not speak > their native language. Who are they really and what do they have own for > today? Only hereditary genes ... Tengrist \\"Aiyy Faith\\" temple House of Purification () (2002) in Yakutsk, Russia, taken away by the authorities. The Yakut philologist Lazar Afanasyev- Teris, PhD has founded Tengrist organisation \\"Kut-Siur\\" (at present, Aiyy Faith) in the 1990‚Äì1993. The headquarters of the International Fund of Tengri Research is also located in Yakutsk. Several Kyrgyz politicians are advocating Tengrism to fill a perceived ideological void. Dastan Sarygulov, secretary of state and former chair of the Kyrgyz state gold-mining company, established in 2005 the Tengir Ordo‚Äîa civic group promoting the values and traditions of Tengrism‚Äîand an International scientific center of Tengrist studies. He based on the ideas of one of the first ideologists of pre-Islamic religion in the post-Soviet space, the Kyrgyz writer Choiun Omuraliyev alias Choiun uulu Omuraly, described in his book Tengrism (1994). Another Kyrgyz proponent of Tengrism, Kubanychbek Tezekbaev, was prosecuted for inciting religious and ethnic hatred in 2011 with statements in an interview describing Kyrgyz mullahs as \\"former alcoholics and murderers\\".RFE/RL 2012-01-31. At the same time, the Kyrgyz authorities do not go for the official registration of \\"Tengirchilik\\" (–¢–µ“£–∏—Ä—á–∏–ª–∏–∫) and other Tengrist associations. They are related to Tengrism or are part of it also movements within the framework of the anti- shamanistic Burkhanism (Ak Jang) that arose in 1904 in Altai and the ethnic faith Vattisen Yaly in Chuvashia, Russia. Articles on Tengrism have been published in social-scientific journals. In 2003 in Bishkek, the Tengir Ordo Foundation held the first international scientific symposium on Tengrism \\"Tengrism‚Äîthe worldview of the Altaic peoples\\". The conference \\"Tengrism as a new factor for the identity construction in Central Asia\\" was organized by the French Institute for Central Asia Studies in Almaty, Kazakhstan, 25 February 2005. Since 2007, every two years, International scientific conferences \\"Tengrism and the epic heritage of Eurasian nomads: origins and modernity\\" have been held in Russia, Mongolia and other countries (the first was sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and Spiritual Development of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia)). Symbols and holy places One of main symbols of Tengrism. A symbol used by many Tengrists, representing the runic spelling of god Tengri and \\"shangrak\\" (an equilateral cross in a circle), depicting the roof opening of a yurt, and a shaman's drum. Many world-pictures and symbols are attributed to folk religions of Central Asia and Russian Siberia. Shamanistic religious symbols in these areas are often intermixed. For example, drawings of world-pictures on Altaic shamanic drums. Mongolian shamanism Temdeg symbol. Shangrak‚Äîtop of the yurt‚Äîsymbol of Tengrism.

The tallest mountain peaks usually became sacred places. Since the time of the Turkic Khaganate, this is Otgontenger in Mongolia‚Äîperhaps, the Otuken of the old inscriptions, state ceremonies are held were. Among others: Belukha (or √úch-S√ºmer) in Russia's Altai, Khan Tengri alias Jengish Chokusu in Kyrgyzstan (not to be confused with the modern Khan Tengri), and Burkhan Khaldun in Mongolia, associated with the name of Genghis Khan. Symbolic mountains are man-made shrines-ovoos. Beliefs God K√∂k Tengri (Blue Sky) is the Supreme Being, the One, the creator of everything. Usually it is understood pantheistically/panentheistically as a non-anthropomorphic Absolute, a concept identical to Taoist Tao, Indian Para Brahman, ancient Greek Apeiron, or Unified Field of modern science. All other deities are revered as Tengri's manifestations or spirits of the elements. Such, for instance, the pantheon of the ancient Turks: Yer-Sub, Umay, Erlik, Earth, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Star, Air, Clouds, Wind, Storm, Thunder and Lightning, Rain and Rainbow. Three- world cosmology As in most ancient beliefs, there is a \\"celestial world\\", the ground and an \\"underworld\\" in Tengrism.Edelbay, Saniya (2012). Traditional Kazakh Culture and Islam. International Journal of Business and Social Science Vol. 3 No. 11 p. 129. The only connection between these realms is the \\"Tree of Worlds\\" that is in the center of the worlds. The celestial and the subterranean world are divided into seven layers (the underworld sometimes nine layers and the celestial world 17 layers). Shamans can recognize entries to travel into these realms. In the multiples of these realms, there are beings, living just like humans on the earth. They also have their own respected souls and shamans and nature spirits. Sometimes these beings visit the earth, but are invisible to people. They manifest themselves only in a strange sizzling fire or a bark to the shaman.T√ºrk Mitolojisi, Murat Uraz, 1992 According to the adherence of Tengrism, the world is not only a three- dimensional environment, but also a rotating circle. Everything is bound by this circle and the tire is always renewed without stopping. The three dimensions of the Earth consists of the movement of the sun, the season which are constantly moving, and the souls of all creatures that are born again after death. Heavenly world The celestial world has many similarities with the earth, but as undefiled by humans. There is a healthy, untouched nature here, and the natives of this place have never deviated from the traditions of their ancestors. This world is much brighter than the earth and is under the auspices of Ulgen another son of Tengri. Shamans can also visit this world. On some days, the doors of this heavenly world are opened and the light shines through the clouds. During this moment, the prayers of the shamans are most influential. A shaman performs his imaginary journey, which takes him to the heavens, by riding a black bird, a deer or a horse or by going into the shape into these animals. Otherwise he may scale the World-Tree or pass the rainbow to reach the heavenly world. Subterranean world There are many similarities between the earth and the underworld and its inhabitants resemble humans, but have only two souls instead of three. They lack the \\"Ami soul\\", that produces body temperature and allows breathing. Therefore, they are pale and their blood is dark. The sun and the moon of the underworld give far less light than the sun and the moon of the earth. There are also forests, rivers and settlements underground. Erlik Khan (Mongolian: Erleg Khan), one of the sons of Tengri, is the ruler of the underworld. He controls the souls here, some of them waiting to be reborn again. Extremely evil souls were believed to be extinguished forever in Ela Guren. If a sick human is not dead yet, a shaman can move to the underworld to negotiate with Erlik to bring the person back to life. If he fails, the person dies. Souls It is believed that people and animals have many souls. Generally, each person is considered to have three souls, but the names, characteristics and numbers of the souls may be different among some of the tribes: For example, for Samoyeds, a Uralic tribe living in the north of Siberia, believe that women consist of four and men of five souls. Since animals also have souls, humans must respect animals. According to Paulsen and Jultkratz, who conducted research in North America, North Asia and Central Asia by Paulsen and Jultkratz, explained two souls of this belief are the same to all people: * Nefes (Breath or Nafs, life or bodily spirit) * Shadow soul / Free soul There are many different names for human souls among the Turks and the Mongols, but their features and meanings have not been adequately researched yet. * Among Turks: √ñz√ºt, S√ºne, Kut, S√ºr, Salkin, Tin, K√∂rm√∂s, Yula * Among Mongols: S√ºnes√ºn, Amin, Kut, S√ºldeG√∂tter und Mythen in Zentralasien und Nordeurasien K√§the Uray-K≈ëhalmi, Jean-Paul Roux, Pertev N. Boratav, Edith Vertes: ƒ∞√ßinden: Jean-Paul Roux: Die altt√ºrkische Mythologie (Eski T√ºrk mitolojisi) In addition to these spirits, Jean Paul Roux draws attention to the \\"√ñzkonuk\\" spirit mentioned in the writings from the Buddhist periods of the Uighurs. Julie Stewart, who devoted her life to research in Mongolia described the belief in the soul in one of her articles: * Amin ruhu: Provides breathing and body temperature. It is the soul which invigorates. (The Turkish counterpart is probably √ñz√ºt) * S√ºnes√ºn ruhu: Outside of the body, this soul moves through water. It is also the part of soul, which reincarnates. After a human died, this part of the soul moves to the world-tree. When it is reborn, it comes out of a source and enters the new-born. (Also called S√ºne ruhu among Turks) * S√ºlde ruhu: It is the soul of the self that gives a person a personality. If the other souls leave the body, they only loss consciousness, but if this soul leaves the body, the human dies. This soul resides in nature after death and is not reborn. Tengrism and Buddhism The 17th century Mongolian chronicle Altan Tobchi (Golden Summary) contains references to Tengri. Tengrism was assimilated into Mongolian Buddhism while surviving in purer forms only in far-northern Mongolia. Tengrist formulas and ceremonies were subsumed into the state religion. This is similar to the fusion of Buddhism and Shinto in Japan. The Altan Tobchi contains the following prayer at its very end: Tengrism and Islam Tengrism is based on personal relationship with God and spirits and personal experiences, which cannot be fixiated in writings; thus there can be no prophet, holy scripture, place of worship, clergy, dogma, rite and prayers. In contrast, Islam is based on a written corpus. Doctrines and religious law derive from the Quran and are explained by hadith. In this regard, both belief systems are fundamentally distinct.Aigle, Denise (2014). The Mongol Empire between Myth and Reality: Studies in Anthropological History, BRILL p. 107 Turks usually encountered and assimilated their beliefs to Islam via Sufism. Turks probably identified Dervishes as something akin to shamans.Findle, Carter V. (2005). The Turks in World History, Oxford University Press First contact between shamanistic Turks and Islam took place during the Battle of Talas against the Chinese Tang dynasty. Turkic Tengrism further influenced parts of Sufism and Folk Islam, especially Alevism with Bektashi Order. Many shamanistic beliefs were considered as genuinely Islamic by many average Muslims and are still prevalent today.√áakmak, Cenap (2017). Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 vols], ABC-CLIO pp. 1425‚Äì29 Muslim Turkic scholar Mahmud al-Kashgari, around the year 1075, whom he considered Tengrists as \\"infidel\\", offered this view: \\"The infidels ‚Äî may God destroy them! ‚Äî call the sky Tengri, also anything that is imposing in their eyes call Tengri, such as a great mountain or tree, and they bow down to such things.\\"Weatherford, Jack (2016). Genghis Khan and the Quest for God: How the World's Greatest Conqueror Gave Us Religious Freedom, p. 59 Tengrists oppose Islam, Christianity and Judaism as Semitic religions imposing a foreign religion to the Turks. And, according to some ones, by praying to the god of Islam the Turkic peoples would give their energy to the Jews and not to themselves (). It excludes the experiences of other nations, but offers Semitic history as if it were the history of all humanity. The principle of submission (both in Islam as well as in Christianity) is disregarded as one of the major failings. It allows rich people to abuse the ordinary people and makes human development stagnant. They advocate Turanism and abandonment of Islam as an Arab religion (Nihal Atsiz and others). Prayer from the heart can only be in native language, not Arabic. On the contrary, others assert that Tengri is indeed synonymous with Allah and that Turkic ancestors did not leave their former belief behind, but simply accepted Allah as new expression for Tengri.Dudolgnon (2013). Islam In Politics In Russia, Routledge pp. 301-4 Aron Atabek draws attention to how the Islamization of the Kazakhs and other Turkic peoples was carried out: runic letters were destroyed, physically persecuted shamans, national musical instruments were burned and playing on them was condemned, etc.Atabek, Aron. \\"Islam and Tengrism. Reflections of the seeker of truth.\\" In \\"Collection of reports at the First international scientific conference on Tengrism \\"Tengrism‚Äîthe worldview of the Altaic peoples\\". Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek, November 2003, p. 194. Tengrism and Christianity Hulegu Khan sent a letter in Latin to King Louis IX of France on April 10, 1262 from his capital Maragheh in Iran. Kept in the Vienna National Library as MS 339 it is both an invitation for joint operations against the Mamluks as well as an imperious command to submit. The letter provides key insights into the Mongols' understanding of Tengrism's relationship to Christianity as well as furnishing one of the first Latin transcriptions of Tengri. Only a few sentences from the lengthy letter are shown below (those with relevancy to Tengrism): The letter largely propounds the usual Mongol ideology and understanding of Tengrism with mentions of the supreme shaman Kokochu Teb Tengri. All meanings of Tengri including the sky, the most high God and \\"a god\\" are implied in the letter. Jesus Christ is called Misicatengrin or Messiah-Tengri in the letter. The Misica is from Syriac mshiha (Messiah, Christ) as opposed to Arabic masih. Another Syriac word in the letter is Barachmar (greetings). This points to the well-known Nestorian heritage within the Mongol Empire which used Syriac as its liturgical language. The Mongolian letter of Arghun Khan to Pope Nicholas IV (1290) also uses the word Misica for Christ. William of Rubruck reported that Arig Boke, brother of Hulegu Khan, used the word Messiah near Karakorum in 1254 (Then they began to blaspheme against Christ, but Arabuccha stopped them saying: \\"You must not speak so, for we know that the Messiah is God\\"). There are elements of syncretism between Tengrism and Nestorian Christianity with overlapping notions of monotheism and a traditional view of Christ as Misicatengrin probably dating back to the Keraite conversion in 1007. In Hulegu's letter Tengrism takes the overarching, non-dogmatic role and contains Nestorianism as a compatible subset, in line with the religious pluralism practiced by the Mongols. Hulegu himself was not strictly a Christian, although his wife, his general Kitbuqa and mother were Nestorians. He was a Tengriist whose Nestorian interests were of the Mongol, syncretic type. His successor Abaqa Khan would take part in the Ninth Crusade with the future King Edward of England in 1271 and also storm the Krak des Chevaliers in February 1281 with the Hospitallers of Margat.

History The monastery was founded in 1112 by Udalschalk, or Udiskalk, a relative of Bishop Ulrich of Passau, to which he gave all his estates as an endowment. In 1114 the new foundation was settled by monks from G√∂ttweig Abbey. Bishop Ulrich dedicated the church in 1116 and granted the abbey the large parish of Aschbach. In 1142 it also received the large parish of Wolfsbach. Out of these two original parishes were formed the fourteen modern parishes for which the abbey is still responsible. In about 1180 Archbishop Wichmann of Magdeburg granted the abbey the extensive woodlands on the Ybbs, with the duty of setting up a cell there and celebrating divine service in perpetuity. There is also some indication in the first century of the abbey's existence that there was already a school. Despite many setbacks, including two serious fires and many disputes over property, the abbey gradually developed. In 1347 the community had 22 members. After a lengthy period of decline Abbot Benedikt I, formerly prior of the Schottenstift in Vienna, introduced the Melk Reforms at Seitenstetten, thus bringing about a revival in its spiritual and cultural life. This abbot had a chapel built and dedicated in 1440 on the Sonntagberg and so established the Sonntagberger Pilgrimage under the control and protection of the abbey. Thereafter the abbey was hard hit by the Hungarian disturbances associated with Matthias Corvinus, the Turkish taxes and above all the Reformation; the number of monks declined sharply. Seitenstetten Abbey Not until the time of Abbot Christoph Held (1572-1602), with the powerful support of the Imperial Council, was any beginning of spiritual revival possible. Under the abbots that followed, the art of the Baroque made its appearance, and the number of monks was augmented by Bavarians and Swabians. But only after the Thirty Years' War did Abbot Gabriel Sauer (1648-74) finally succeed in stabilising the abbey economically and then in bringing about a true religious renewal. Seitenstetten Abbey church Now it was also possible for major building work to begin. Abbot Benedikt II Abelzhauser (1687-1717) commissioned Jakob Prandtauer (succeeded in the work by his nephew Josef Munggenast) to build the magnificent Pilgrimage Church of the Holy Trinity on the Sonntagberg. The early Gothic abbey church was lavishly refurbished, including work by Franz Joseph Feuchtmayer. Between 1718 and 1747 the Baroque conventual buildings that still stand today were constructed. Ceiling frescoes in the Marble Hall (1735) and the library (1740) were executed by Paul Troger, while those on the grand staircase were by Bartolomeo Altomonte. The summer refectory contains 19 pictures by Kremser Schmidt. The finance for these lavish works came principally from the abbey's copper mines in the Radmer (Styria) and the brass foundry at Reichraming (Upper Austria). After the difficulties of the anti- monastic policies of Emperor Joseph II and of the Napoleonic wars, the abbey gradually regained its strength through the 19th century, until the time of Abbot Theodor Springer (1920-58), who not only brought the abbey safely through the economic crisis after World War I but also through the National Socialist period and World War II without its being dissolved, as so many other monasteries were. Since the war more renovations have taken place both to the Pilgrimage Church and to the structure of the abbey itself. Besides the major works of art and architecture mentioned previously, there are also the Romanesque Knights' Chapel (Ritterkapelle), the picture gallery, and the garden, which contains about 110 different types of rose, mostly historical. Since 1625 the abbey has been a member of the Austrian Congregation, now within the Benedictine Confederation.

The trial took place in 1985 and is so far the only example of such a large scale procedure by a democratic government against a former dictatorial government of the same country in Latin America. Those on trial were: Jorge Rafael Videla, Emilio Eduardo Massera, Roberto Eduardo Viola, Armando Lambruschini, Orlando Ram√≥n Agosti, Omar Graffigna, Leopoldo Galtieri, Jorge Anaya and Basilio Lami Dozo  Overview  The Trial of the Juntas began on 22 April 1985, during the presidential administration of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n, the first elected government after the restoration of democracy in 1983. The main prosecutors were Julio C√©sar Strassera and his assistant Luis Moreno Ocampo (who would go on to become the first Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.) The trial was presided over by a tribunal of six judges: Le√≥n Arslani√°n, Jorge Torlasco, Ricardo Gil Lavedra, Andr√©s D'Alessio, Jorge Valerga Ar√°oz, and Guillermo Ledesma. The dictatorship was a series of several military governments under four military juntas. The fourth junta, before calling for elections and relinquishing power to the democratic authorities, enacted a Self-Amnesty Law on April 18, 1983, as well as a secret decree that ordered the destruction of records and other evidence of their past crimes. Preparation Three days after his inauguration, on 13 December 1983), President Alfons√≠n signed Decree No. 158, which mandated the initiation of legal proceedings against the nine military officers of the first three juntas, but not the fourth (ruled by General Reynaldo Bignone). The National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons was established two days later to collect testimonies from thousands of witnesses, and presented 8,960 cases of forced disappearances to the president on 20 September 1984. Following the refusal of a military court to try former junta members, Alfons√≠n established a National Criminal Court of Appeals for the purpose on 14 October. Trial of the Juntas This trial, which officially began on 22 April 1985, is so far the only example of such a large scale procedure by a democratic government against a former dictatorial government of the same country in Latin America. It was the first major trial held for war crimes since the N√ºremberg Trials in Germany following World War II, and the first to be conducted by a civilian court. It succeeded in prosecuting the crimes of the juntas, which included kidnapping, torture, forced disappearance, and murder of an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 people during what was called the Dirty War against political dissidents. Opposition to the trial was largely limited to critical commentary by politicians, lawyers, and media figures sympathetic to the dictatorship. Some protest became violent: during the sentencing phase of the trial, 29 bomb threats were made to several Buenos Aires schools, and a number of bombs were detonated in key government installations, including the Ministry of Defense. On October 25, President Alfons√≠n declared a 60-day state of emergency.\\"Alfonsin decreta estado sitio\\", El Pa√≠s (26 Oct 1985) Prosecutors presented 709 cases, of which 280 were heard. A total of 833 witnesses testified during the cross-examination phase, which lasted until 14 August. Witnesses included former President Alejandro Lanusse, writer Jorge Luis Borges, Estela Barnes de Carlotto, President of Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo; \\"Night of the Pencils\\" survivor Pablo D√≠az; Patricia M.

Sentencing Sentencing was read on 9 December: General Jorge Videla and Admiral Emilio Massera were sentenced to life imprisonment, General Roberto Viola: seventeen years, Admiral Armando Lambruschini: eight years, General Orlando Agosti: four and a half years. Omar Graffigna, Leopoldo Galtieri, Jorge Anaya and Basilio Lami Dozo were acquitted, though the latter three were concomitantly court martialed for malfeasance in waging the Falklands War of 1982. Charges against 600 others were brought to court, but these lawsuits were hampered by the Full Stop Law of 1986, which limited suits to those indicted within 60 days of the law's enactment, and the Law of Due Obedience of 1987, which effectively halted most remaining trials of Dirty War perpetrators. Aftermath Between 1989 and 1990, President Carlos Menem pardoned the men who had been sentenced or court-martialed. President N√©stor Kirchner obtained an Argentine Supreme Court ruling permitting extraditions in cases of crimes against humanity in 2003, and that same year the Congress repealed the Full Stop Law. In 2005 the Supreme Court ruled that the 1986 and 1987 laws shielding officers accused of crimes were unconstitutional.\\"Major events in the life of Nestor Kirchner\\" , M24 In 2006 the government tried Miguel Etchecolatz, the first to be prosecuted of potentially 600 defendants.

Born to English parents in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where his father worked on tea and rubber plantations, he was educated in Australia and went to Britain to do national service as an artillery officer in an anti-aircraft regiment between 1944 and 1945. He then studied law at Queen's College, Oxford before leaving for New Zealand, where he worked in amateur theatre before returning to Britain to begin his professional career. His stage appearances included the original productions of A Man For All Seasons and A Day in the Death of Joe Egg. Making his film debut in 1947, Carson carved out a career appearing in low-budget British films such as Seven Keys (1961); Smokescreen (1964); and Master Spy (1964). His saturnine looks and sinister voice (sometimes compared with James Mason) led to him starring in a number of horror films including The Night Caller (1965); The Plague of the Zombies (1966); The Man Who Haunted Himself (1970); Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970); and Captain Kronos ‚Äì Vampire Hunter (1972).Madeline Smith and John Carson Join Hammer Horror: The Warner Bros.

The community, originally known as South Side or Little Bay has its origins in the French fishery of the seventeenth century when the good natural harbour would attract fishermen to spend the summer in the area and return to France for the winter months. Permanently settled in the eighteenth century, the community remained a fishing village for nearly 200 years until the advent of the railroad.

The town quickly became a major centre in Western Newfoundland. The town became a distributor of goods to the surrounding area and the Port au Port Peninsula. Lumbering, fishing and farming were the primary occupations and lobster plants also opened there. A brewery/distillery also operated there for a short time at the turn of the century. The community also became the seat of the magistrate in the area and a courthouse was constructed.

Alschuler\\" (history), archINFORM, 2006-10-12, Eng.archINFORM.net webpage: archINFORM-ASA. Biography Alschuler was born in Chicago and was educated in the public school system. He graduated with a Master in Science from the Armour Institute of Technology in 1899 and spent a year studying architecture at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1900, he began his career as a draftsman for famed architect Dankmar Adler. Alschuler studied under Adler for five years before joining the firm of Samuel Treat for two years. Alschuler opened his own office in 1907. Also in 1907, he married Rose Haas Alschuler, and together they would have five children. His designs included warehouses, department stores, industrial buildings, synagogues, and offices. Alschuler's legacy lives on in the form of historically significant buildings such as the London Guaranty & Accident Building (1922‚Äì23) at the intersection of N. Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange Building (1927), another of Alschuler's acclaimed commercial buildings, suffered a less fortunate fate; The Merc was demolished in 2003, despite a spirited set of protests organized by local preservation groups. The silver lining of The Merc's demolition was the creation of a new Chicago law which provides the Landmarks Commission a 90-day period to review and potentially save historically significant buildings. Other significant industrial and commercial works by Alschuler include the Bull Dog and Whistle Restaurant, Brach's Candy Factory, the Florsheim Shoe Factory, the Garment Center Building, and the Benson-Rixon Department Store. Alschuler was also an accomplished designer of Jewish synagogues in the Chicago area, including the current K.A.M. Isaiah Israel Temple, Agudath Achim Bikur Cholim Synagogue, B'nai Sholom, Anshe Emet Synagogue, Am Shalom in Glencoe, and Am Echod in Waukegan. A member of the American Institute of Architects, Alfred S. Alschuler died on June 11, 1940, near age 64, in Chicago. His son John also trained as an architect, as did Alfred S. Alschuler Jr..

It is situated in the centre of the city not far from Aarhus Cathedral (√Örhus Domkirke). The church's crypt contains a stone church dating to 1060 AD. History The church was originally known as St. Nicholas' Church but was expanded by the construction of a Dominican priory in 1240, the Vor Frue Kloster (Our Lady's Priory), of which the present church formed the southern wing. After the Reformation in Denmark, the name was changed to the Church of Our Lady and King Christian III decreed that the surrounding buildings, formerly a priory of the Dominicans, should function as a hospital for the sick and poor. The church was subsequently granted congregational privileges which officially made it a centre for clerical activities in its area. Between 1250 and 1500 the church was heavily expanded by the addition of, among other things, the large tower. In the 1950s a crypt-church was rediscovered beneath the church during renovations. The crypt church dates to approximately 1060 AD. The church has since been renovated again in 2000. Crypt church The crypt church beneath the Church of Our Lady The crypt church is the oldest extant stone church in Scandinavia. Built in 1060 after the old wooden church had been burned in an assault on the town, the church is situated beneath the main building of the Church of Our Lady. After its discovery in the 1950s, it was restored and reopened on 10 November 1957 and is now used for mass once a week. During the restoration by the Danish National Museum, two graves were found - one of a child and one of an adult - and 23 coins from the 14th century. Five of these coins were from L√ºbeck and the rest from Hamburg. The crypt church was initially built as an attempt to weaken Adalbert, archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, who had considerable influence on Danish clerical matters, as the head of the Danish church. Svend Estridsen (1047‚Äì1074) divided Denmark into 8 bishoprics, and in 1060, Christian became the first bishop of Aarhus. The crypt church was built the same year. Around 1080, a new and larger church was built here, named after Saint Nicholas, just like numerous other Danish churches of the time. In 1180, it was mentioned as Aarhus' first cathedral, but was demolished when the Dominicans came to town. There is no historic information about the crypt church from the following centuries. At some point the rooms were walled off and used as a storage room, until the church itself was forgotten. Priory The exact year for the erection of the Dominican priory is not known. Different sources point both to the years 1227 and 1239; it is generally assumed that the priory was fully established by approximately 1240. The priory was separated from the Church of Our Lady during the Reformation, when King Christian III (1534‚Äì1559) decided that the church should function as a parish church, while the other priory buildings should be used as a hospital and poor house. In 1888 part of the former priory was converted into a chapel for the residents of the building, then as now principally the elderly.

The three films in the series are Auton (1997), Auton 2: Sentinel (1998; working title, Auton 2: The Rapture) and Auton 3 (1999; working title, Auton 3: Awakening). They were produced by the independent BBV company and are sequels to the Third Doctor stories Spearhead from Space and Terror of the Autons. All three films have been reissued on DVD. All story elements relating to Doctor Who were licensed from their respective authors. Synopses When a Nestene energy unit and several Autons are reactivated at a UNIT facility, a plot for world domination that predates mankind is set in motion. Plot Auton At a top secret UNIT facility known only as \\"the Warehouse\\", Dr Sally Arnold has been studying a Nestene energy unit with no results. As a last resort, she subjects the artifact to cosmic signals from UNIT's most powerful deep space scanning satellite. This causes a violent energy release that kills her assistant, Janice. The energy unit has disappeared. A containment team, led by a psychic UNIT operative named Lockwood, has been dispatched. Among Lockwood's abilities is the ability to access all information from any computer mainframe in the world with his mind. They soon learn that the Nestene energy unity has taken on a mobile form, and that there is an Auton copy of senior archivist Graham Winslet. The real Winslet is still alive, his mind being used by the Autons as a resource of information. The energy unit then merges with the Auton Winslet. Several dormant Autons in the Warehouse come back to life and the building becomes a battlefield. They are eventually defeated with the weapon created by the Doctor and Liz Shaw in Spearhead from Space. The Auton Winslet then liquefies and escapes through a ventilation shaft. Auton 2: Sentinel Two years after the Warehouse incident, a lorry transporting Autons from the Warehouse to another UNIT facility is hijacked by its own cargo. Meanwhile, Lockwood is troubled by extremely active dreams. UNIT learns that the transfer of the Autons was authorized by Lockwood. When he later remembers signing the transportation docket, it becomes evident that the Nestene Consciousness is using Lockwood's psychic abilities to their own ends. UNIT's Internal Security Division launches an investigation on Lockwood, pairing him with another psychic operative named Natasha Alexander. While Lockwood's abilities are owed to an alien implant, Natasha claims to have been psychic since birth. The escaped Autons are traced to Sentinel Island. There the Auton Winslet has installed himself as the local vicar. He has brainwashed most of the island's inhabitants and the Autons have killed those who resisted. They are using the combined mental energy of the church's congregation to awaken a Nestene creature buried beneath. There are dormant Nestenes lying underground around the world. They were put in place before the development of the human race. Their locations have become known to humanity as holy sites and are connected by ley lines. When Lockwood and Natasha arrive at the church, they succeed in reviving the Nestene. The Nestene attempts to awaken the others. Lockwood tries to defeat it, but instead absorbs the creature into his own mind. Auton 3 Lockwood and Natasha have returned from Sentinel Island, coming on shore in the town of Millhampton. Computers around the world are failing. They are being invaded by the Nestene Consciousness through Lockwood's implant. Meanwhile, the entire population of Millhampton has disappeared. They have been absorbed into the mind of another revived Nestene below the city. The only survivor is the real Winslet, who is still being used by the Nestenes at the local psychiatric hospital. Lockwood and Natasha are both being used by another psychic UNIT operative named Palmer to lead them to the heart of the Nestene activity. Palmer monitors their movements through a constant link with Natasha's mind. Meanwhile, Natasha is used by the Nestenes to lure Lockwood to the hospital, which the Autons are using as the centre of their operation. There the Auton Winslet is trying to free the Nestene energy from Lockwood's mind so it can infect every computer in the world and revive all the dormant Nestene creatures. Lockwood resists by convincing himself that everything he sees is a dream. When Dr Arnold arrives, his resolve is broken. He is then forced to sacrifice his own life to destroy the Nestene plan. Trivia and continuity *Auton was originally intended to include Brigadier Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart, but actor Nicholas Courtney had to decline due to the fact he was ill during production. The character of the Brigadier was replaced by Lockwood, who would also appear in the next two films. *In Auton 2: Sentinel, it is revealed that Lockwood is actually the codename of the otherwise unnamed UNIT Operative 8954B. *The call sign Greyhound Leader, used in Doctor Who successively by Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, Brigadier Bambera,Brigadier Winifred Bambera is Greyhound Leader in Battlefield. and Kate Stewart,Kate Stewart is addressed as Greyhound Leader by the helicopter crew transporting the TARDIS in \\"Day of the Doctor\\". is used by three different characters in the trilogy: Lockwood (Auton), Colonel Wilson (Auton 2: Sentinel) and Ross Palmer (Auton 3: Awakening). *A spoof of these dramas, titled \\"The Auton Diaries\\", is included on the VHS and DVD releases of Auton 3: Awakening. The plot involves an out of work Auton finding new employment at BBV. *BBV's Do You Have a Licence to Save this Planet includes an Auton 3-style Auton. *Nicholas Briggs, who directed the first two films and wrote all three, would go on to play the voices of the Daleks and Cybermen in the 2005 revival, as well as original Dalek voice actor, Peter Hawkins, in An Adventure in Space and Time and government official, Rick Yates, in Torchwood: Children of Earth. *In a chase scene about 13 minutes into Auton 3: Awakening, the Autons have shadows longer than their own bodies, the sun being low in the sky. However, 10 seconds later they are seen with much shorter shadows, revealing that different parts of the chase were filmed at significantly different times of day, in the BBC car park in Southampton, without the permission of the BBC. *US retailer Who North America (http://www.whona.com) contributed US$10,000 to the Auton 3 project. *When admiring the warehoused Auton-killing device near the end of the first film, Lockwood compliments its absent designer: \\"Not a bad bit of workmanship, Doctor John Smith.\\" The Third Doctor built the device in his premi√®re serial, Spearhead from Space, at the end of which he asked his new employer, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, to use the name John Smith on his UNIT credentials.

Opposition/OBA nominees were: * Nandi Outerbridge * Nicholas Kempe, and * Andrew Simons. History Bermuda's Parliament was created in 1620, and originally had one house, the House of Assembly. Political parties were not legal, and the role now performed by the Senate was originally performed by an appointed council, called the Governor's Council, or Privy Council. The council also performed the role that today belongs to the Cabinet (the Cabinet is composed of Ministers appointed from elected Members of Parliament from the House of Assembly). Historically, the Council, composed of members of Bermuda's wealthy merchant class, had been the true centre of power, rather than the elected House of Assembly, or the Governor despatched from overseas. During periods when the colony was without a Governor, the President of the Council would be Acting Governor. The balance of power began to shift away from the Council in the 19th century, when Bermuda assumed a new importance in Imperial security, and when the Governor became also the Commander-in-Chief of the naval establishment and military garrison. In 1888, the Privy Council was split into an Executive Council, which later became the Cabinet, and a Legislative Council, which became the upper house of Parliament with appointed members. In 1968, largely as a result of the civil rights movement, a new Constitution was introduced which made a number of changes to Bermuda's parliamentary system, making it more like the Westminster system. Political parties were legalised, and the system of a majority Government, from which a Premier was appointed and the Cabinet Ministers were drawn, and a minority opposition was adopted. Under the 1968 Constitution, the Legislative Council was replaced by the Senate. The system of suffrage, by which the members of the lower house were elected, and which had historically been limited to male landowners, was finally extended to all adults.

It rises on a spur between the torre Camastro and the wood surrounding the Serrapotamo valley. History Laurenzana's origins probably date from the 12th century when the Normans decided to build a fortified village in this area due to its strategic position. In 1268 Laurenzana took part in the Ghibelline revolt against Pope Clement V. During the Aragonese domination, it was ruled by the Orsini del Balzo and then in the 15th century by the Loffredos followed by the Filangieris the De Ruggieros, the De Quartos and the Belgioiosos. Main sights The ruins of a 12th to 13th-century Laurenzana castle are found in the crag atop the village. Laurenzana castle Ruins The Chiesa Madre dell'Assunta with a stone portal dating from 1780 is the main church. It a polychrome marble main altar, and a 16th-century fresco along with 18th- century Neapolitan school altarpieces. Near the Assunta there is a belvedere from which it is possible to view the surrounding valleys and mountains. Near town is a trail in the Abetina (\\"Fir-wood\\") of Laurenzana, covering an area of on which silver firs and beech trees grow. The Societ√† Botanica Italiana has considered the Abetina as a biotope of extraordinary environmental interest and has designated it a \\"Riserva Naturale Regionale\\". The Church of the Madonna del Carmine houses a 1611 canvas painted by Giovanni Battista Serra from Tricarico. Economy Up to a few years ago, Laurenzana was famous for the production of high quality liquors produced in four distilleries situated within the village. Handicraft activities regarding the manufacture of wooden barrels, bagpipes and wrought-iron were also widespread. The economy of the village is mainly based on agriculture; in fact, it is possible to find silviculture and animal breeding farms producing delicious dairy products.Excerpted from: Basilicata \\"Terra di Storia Cultura e Tradizione\\",Giovanni Varasano Editoria, 1998 Religious festivals *Beato Egidio da Laurenzana: January 10 (date of birth); Last Sunday in May or First Sunday in June *Sant'Antonio di Padova : June 13 *San Vito : June 15 *Madonna del Carmelo : July 16 *San Rocco : August 16 *Madonna Addolorata : Last Sunday in September Typical local dishes *Calzone ripieno con salame.

The premises centered on the Romanesque monastery church were largely rebuilt in a Baroque style in the 17th century. The abbey was dissolved in 1782 by decree of Emperor Joseph II, but resettled in 1809 with monks descending from St. Blaise Abbey in the Black Forest. History Catherine and Benedict of Nursia, 1493 fresco The abbey was founded by the Sponheim count Engelbert I, Margrave of Istria since 1090, on the site of a former castle and a church consecrated by Archbishop Hartwig of Salzburg in 991. A follower of Pope Gregory VII and Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg in the Investiture Controversy with Emperor Henry IV, Engelbert had forfeited his county in the Tyrolean Puster Valley but could retire to the Carinthian estates his father Siegfried I of Spanheim had acquired through his marriage with the local aristocrat Richgard. A second church dedicated to Saint Paul the Apostle had already been erected at the site by Count Siegfried I. In 1085 Engelbert sent his eldest son Engelbert II to Abbot William of Hirsau in Swabia. He returned to Carinthia with twelve Benedictine monks from Hirsau Abbey, who received the church and monastery of St. Paul's on 1 May 1091, together with large estates in the Lavant Valley, in the March of Styria and in Friuli. Count Engelbert thereby continued the tradition of several Benedictine monastery foundations in the Carinthian duchy, such as Saint George's Abbey, L√§ngsee about 1000, Ossiach Abbey around 1024, the nunnery of Gurk about 1043, and Millstatt Abbey around 1070. In April 1095 he joined the monastic community himself and died at St. Paul's Abbey the next year. Backed by subsidies from Hirsau Abbey as well as by Engelbert's brother Archbishop Hartwig of Magdeburg, the monastery quickly prospered and, with its own scriptorium and a grammar school, evolved into the most significant Abbey in Carinthia. Pope Urban II put it under papal protection in 1099 and prevented its development to a proprietary monastery of the Sponheim dynasty. The ecclesiastical reservation was renewed by Pope Innocent II, who decreed the abbey's exemption in 1140, while the Sponheims, ruling Dukes of Carinthia since 1122, served as Vogt protectors. The abbots had to cope with the resentment of the local nobility and sought protection from both the Papacy and the Holy Roman Emperor. During the 15th century conflict of the Habsburg duke Frederick III with the Counts of Celje, the troops of Count Ulrich II devastated the premises. The abbey was again ravaged by Ottoman forces in 1476 and besieged by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus in 1480. In the early Ottoman‚ÄìHabsburg wars, the Habsburg rulers increasingly encumbered the monastery with tributes. They rivalled with the Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg to exert influence, while the conventual life decayed. In the 16th century, large parts of Carinthia turned Protestant and two abbots were declared deposed by Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria. Abbot Hieronymus Marchstaller, 1629 portrait The resurgence of St. Paul's began under Hieronymus Marchstaller, abbot from 1616. The derelict premises around the monastery church were rebuilt according to plans modelled on the Spanish Escorial. The reconstruction was completed under Marchstaller's successors until 1683. In 1782/87 Emperor Joseph II dissolved the monastery and nationalised its possessions, however, in 1809, under the Prince-Abbot Dr. Berthold Rottler, monks from St. Blaise's Abbey in the Black Forest, which had also just been dissolved, moved into the premises. In 1940 the abbey was dissolved again by the National Socialists but the monks were able to return when it was reopened in 1947. Today it is the oldest operational monastery in Carinthia. From 1641 the abbey was a member of the Salzburg Congregation, which in 1930 was merged into the present Austrian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. Abbey church Within the abbey precinct there is a Romanesque basilica dating from the end of the 12th century. After a fire in 1367 a Gothic vaulted ceiling was added, painted with 44 frescoes by the Tyrolean masters Friedrich and Michael Pacher. The interior decoration of the church by the Styrian artist Philipp Jakob Straub dates from the 18th century.

History Holm Park was built after Milford Everton were unable to continue using their home ground, Holm in Milford due to changes in ground criteria of the Irish League B Division. In 1988, Milford Everton moved to Armagh and looked for a suitable place for a new ground while groundsharing with Armagh Old Boys and renaming themselves Armagh City. Holm Park was built after a lease of land from Armagh City and District Council in 1991. The pitch was laid in 1992 and several additions to the ground continued until 1994. In 2002, Holm Park was at the centre of a dispute over the location of the Mid Ulster Radcliffe Cup Final between Lurgan Celtic and Loughgall after it was moved from Mourneview Park due to alleged threats against Lurgan Celtic. Holm Park was selected by the Mid-Ulster Football Association as the venue for the final, however Lurgan complained to the Irish Football Association that the vote included Loughgall votes. The IFA referred the matter back to the Mid-Ulster FA who voted again for Holm Park to be the final venue. In 2009, Holm Park was used by County Fermanagh based Ballinamallard United for their home matches in the IFA Championship 1 as their Ferney Park ground did not meet the Irish Football Association's ground criteria. In 2010, due to constant pitch damage as a result of several matches played on it in short time periods because of postponements, Armagh City applied to Sport Northern Ireland supported by Armagh City and District Council for a grant to install a 3G pitch at Holm Park. At a cost of ¬£425,000, the FIFA approved pitch was installed. It was officially opened with a match between Armagh City and NIFL Premiership team Portadown but the first match was a Bob Radcliffe Cup match against Lurgan Celtic. Holm Park has also hosted the final of the Mid-Ulster Cup as well as Northern Ireland national under-19 football team matches.

A reserve can appear in any part of shareholders' equity except for contributed or basic share capital. In nonprofit accounting, an \\"operating reserve\\" is the unrestricted cash on hand available to sustain an organization, and nonprofit boards usually specify a target of maintaining several months of operating cash or a percentage of their annual income, called an Operating Reserve Ratio. http://www.nccs2.org/wiki/images/2/26/Summary_Nonprofit_Operating_Reserve_Ratio.pdf There are different types of reserves used in financial accounting like capital reserves, revenue reserves, statutory reserves, realized reserves, unrealized reserves. Equity reserves are created from several possible sources: * Reserves created from shareholders' contributions, the most common examples of which are: :*legal reserve fund - it is required in many legislations and it must be paid as a percentage of share capital :*share premium - amount paid by shareholders for shares in excess of their nominal value *Reserves created from profit, especially retained earnings, i.e. accumulated accounting profits, or in the case of nonprofits, operating surpluses. However, profits may be distributed also to other types of reserves, for example: :*legal reserve fund from profit - many legislations require creation of the fund as a percentage of profits :*remuneration reserve - will be used later to pay bonuses to employees or management. :*translation reserve - arises during consolidation of entities with different reporting currencies Reserve is the profit achieved by a company where a certain amount of it is put back into the business which can help the business in their rainy days. The preceding sentence may give the unwary reader the sense that this item is an asset, a debit balance. This is false. A reserve is always a credit balance. Retained Earnings typically has a credit balance. If a firm wants to label part of Retained Earnings as a Reserve for Reinvestment, then that labeling does not harm, but neither does it do anything about making assets, liquid or otherwise, available for any day, rainy or otherwise. Sometimes reserve is used in the sense of provision. This is inconsistent with the terminology suggested by International Accounting Standards Board. For more information about provisions, see provision (accounting). The preceding is, indeed, correct IASB usage, but be aware in the U.S., under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, \\"provision\\" refers to a debit balance, not a credit balance. \\"Provision\\" is a dangerous word to use in attempting to achieve clear communications in conversations with U.S. and IASB conversations. \\"Provision for Income Taxes\\" means expense in U.S. GAAP and liability in IASB vernacular.

The religious order was established in 1859 in Newark, New Jersey, following the example of Elizabeth Ann Seton's community that was founded in 1809 in Emmitsburg, Maryland. History Mother Mary Xavier Mehegan, S.C. In 1858, the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, James Roosevelt Bayley, a nephew of Elizabeth Ann Seton, applied to Mount Saint Vincent's, New York, for sisters to form a separate mother-house in his diocese. Mary Xavier Mehegan, a member of the Sisters of Charity of New York was placed in charge of St. Mary's, Newark.\\"Brief History\\" Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth At the request of Bishop Bayley, Sister Mary Xavier was appointed superior of the new foundation, with Sister Mary Catherine Nevin assistant. The habit and the constitutions of the Sisters of Charity in New York were retained. On 29 September, 1859, the new community was formally opened in St. Mary's, Newark, the first superior general being the Reverend Bernard J. McQuaid, later Bishop of Rochester, New York. Bishop Bayley had strongly advocated a change in the head-dress of the sisters. This, however, was not carried into effect until 1874, when the black cap adopted by Mother Seton was replaced by a white one with a black veil. Education Saint Ann Villa, Morristown The Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth founded the Academy of Saint Elizabeth, the first secondary school for young women in the state, near Morristown in 1860 during the same year that they established their motherhouse at that location.\\"History\\", Academy of Saint Elizabeth Eventually, the nearby community became known as Convent Station because of a railway station built during the 1870s with funds provided by the order, to accommodate their needs. In 1899 the religious order also established the College of Saint Elizabeth on the same campus, becoming the first four year liberal arts college for women in New Jersey and one of the first Catholic colleges in the United States to award degrees to women.

It was situated at Crompton Fold. Crompton Hall was in the township for hundreds of years. The hall has two known stages, the first being a medieval one, of which the manor existed at least as early as 1442 to provide for Norman conquest settlers, the second was a 19th-century phase, built in c.1848 with much more splendour, and reflected the Crompton's increased affluence much due to the Industrial Revolution which took place in the town. Crompton Hall was demolished in 1952, but much of its forested gardens still remain today. History The Crompton family has a well documented history. Crompton first appears as a family name when the De La Legh family (settlers from the Norman conquest) changed their name to indicate the Anglo-Saxon township they had obtained and settled in during the 13th century. The family were prosperous landowners of the area, from their initial medieval acquisition, through to the early 20th century. The Crompton family owned a large house by the name of Crompton Hall which first appears in historical records as early as 1442 and owned by Thomas de Crompton and his family. Sir Winston Churchill once stayed at Crompton Hall and he had written letters describing how peaceful and tranquil the area was.Greer, Stuart, (June 15, 2006), \\"More housing will make lives a misery\\", Oldham Advertiser, p.24 Demolition The original medieval Crompton Hall was demolished c.1848. A second and apparently 'magnificent' Crompton Hall, set in its own prominent forested grounds, was erected by the family, but following the dissipation and eventual death of the last remaining family members, the site was sold off and the manor was demolished in 1952 to make way for an exclusive development of bungalows. Whilst the local council attempted to buy the Grade II listed building and contents for means of preserving civic heritage, the building was not sold to them, and was somewhat hastily destroyed with the contents of the home sold off at auction to the highest bidder. Post-demolition Some of the original forested grounds of Crompton Hall can still be found in the Buckstones area of Crompton today, and is a small but popular public woods. The woodland (of which many of the horse chestnut, oak, and maple trees are currently protected by a tree preservation order) are home to a number of animal species, including owls, foxes, bats, wood pigeons, hedgehogs and grey squirrels. The site of Crompton Hall is now one of controversy, as part of the public woods is undergoing a process of planning permission to build a number of proposed three story luxury flats. This has been met with considerable protest due to the nature of the buildings and the requirement of many trees to be felled. The \\"Crompton Hall Action Group\\" was set up by local communities to halt any building work of this kind. Though two attempts at halting development permissions in the location failed, a revised project was proposed due to credit crunch, featuring less houses, of smaller size, with the Group commenting that the new application was an improvement, though they still opposed it. Councillors of the Action Group said they were ‚Äúbetween the devil and the deep blue sea‚Äù, as disputing the project again could bring back the initial project. The applicants, on the other hand, promised measures to safeguard protected species such as bats.

It is the home ground of Dungannon Swifts, and holds 5,000 spectators, 300 of whom can be seated.  History  Stangmore Park with the clubhouse in the background Stangmore Park was opened in 1975 after a temporary wooden social club was built after Dungannon Swifts had bought the land from a local company. In 1982, the wooden social club was removed and replaced with a clubhouse. In 2006, Stangmore Park was attacked by vandals. Eight crates of beer had been stolen from the ground. The police reported that half of the bottles in the crates had littered the pitch with glass being stuck in the goals and the centre of the pitch. This also led to the postponement of a semi-final of the Bob Radcliffe Cup. Stangmore Park has often been used as a nominated home ground for teams promoted into the IFA Premiership if their own grounds fail to meet Irish Football Association criteria. In 2012, Ballinamallard United originally nominated Stangmore Park as their home ground after being promoted from the IFA Championship if construction at their Ferney Park ground could not be completed in time for the start of the season. In 2013, Warrenpoint Town also nominated Stangmore Park as their home ground for the first few months of the 2013‚Äì14 season as their own home ground, Milltown, was not up to Premiership standard after the IFA refused permission for them to move to The Showgrounds, Newry. During this period, the ground was brought up to Premiership standard. Warrenpoint's final home game at the ground was a 2‚Äì1 win over Coleraine on 30 November 2013, after which they moved back to Milltown.  Usage  Stangmore Park is usually used to host Dungannon's home matches. In 2011, it was due to host the Northern Ireland national under-16 football team's match against Poland however the match was moved to Seaview, Belfast due to a waterlogged pitch at Stangmore Park. Although Stangmore Park is primarily used for football, it has also hosted kickboxing.

The 2008‚Äì09 Irish League Cup and 2010‚Äì11 Irish League Cup finals were held at the stadium in the first League Cup finals to be held outside Belfast.  History  Between 1992 and 2011, Mourneview Park underwent a number of significant renovations, including the building of three new seated stands. Mourneview Park has been used by the Irish Football Association to host neutral matches in the past. In 2003, the Irish Football Association removed Mourneview Park as a potential semi-final host for the Irish Cup because of rioting between fans of Glentoran and Portadown. Mourneview Park has previously been attacked by arsonists, including in 2005 when a petrol bomb was thrown into a supporters club bar which destroyed it, leading to Glenavon considering closing Mourneview Park because of the continuous damage. In 2009, it was selected to host the 2009 Irish League Cup final because neither of Belfast's Big Two made it to the final and it would have been harder for fans of finalists Newry City and Portadown to get to a Belfast venue. This was the same case for the 2011 Irish League Cup Final, with Mourneview Park being chosen because the finalists were Lisburn Distillery and Portadown, 2 of the closest Premiership clubs to Mourneview Park at that time. In 2014, Mourneview Park was nominated by Belfast club Linfield to be their designated home ground for their home matches in the UEFA Europa League after their normal home ground, Windsor Park was undergoing redevelopment. Mourneview Park was chosen as the venue for the 2015 Irish Cup semi-final between Glentoran and Crusaders due to the unavailability of Windsor Park ahead of a Northern Ireland international fixture. The ground was further used for semi-finals in the 2016‚Äì17 and 2018‚Äì19 editions of the competition.

It is the home ground of Larne F.C.. The land was acquired by Larne in 1918 and has been in continuous use as a stadium ever since. In 2010 the official capacity was set for safety reasons at 1,100 with seating for 656 in the main stand. In 2010 the club struck an agreement with property developers GML who agreed to build a new stadium on the site that would meet the Irish League's domestic licence criteria to enable Larne to play senior football should they win the Championship One in the future in return for Larne's agreement to give up an acre of land adjacent to a development site next to the ground. The deal, however, has been delayed due to the falling value of the property market, which has led GML to halve their initial bid of ¬£6 million for the land. An agreement is expected in 2011 that will see the project commence by 2012, but it was delayed again, so it has not started until 2016.

Like the two-door Roundup and premium Bermuda station wagons, the Villager was initially built on a 116 in wheelbase shared with Ford's station wagons, and, throughout its lifespan, shared Ford's wagons core body stampings. The Villager and the Ranger were the only two model names that existed throughout Edsel's three-year life span as an automobile marque. A 1958 Edsel Villager The Villager represented the lower trim level available within the Edsel brand for station wagons, but differed from the two-door Roundup by being offered in six and nine passenger styles. The Villager was available in a four-door configuration only. In terms of interior and exterior trim, the Villager had parity with the Edsel Ranger's interior and exterior appointments. Standard features included black rubber floor mats, ashtrays, cigar lighter, arm rests, chromed rear-view mirror and crank-operated rear windows. Like all other Edsel wagons, the Villager came with a two-piece tailgate. Seat belts were optional. All 1958 station wagons shared the Ranger's engine choices, with a 361 in¬≥ V8 as standard. All wagons came with a three-speed manual transmission. Buyers also had the option of a three-speed automatic transmission with a standard column-mounted gear selector, or during the 1958 model year, they could choose Edsel's highly touted but trouble-prone Teletouch automatic, which placed its drive-selection buttons in the steering wheel hub. 1958 Edsel Villager rear 1959 Edsel Villager rear To differentiate the wagons offered by Edsel from their Ford counterparts, they were fitted with Edsel's front fascia and grille assembly. The wagons also received unique boomerang-shaped taillights for 1958. The shape of these taillights posed a problem when used as turn indicators ‚Äì the left-hand taillight appeared as an arrow pointing right and vice versa from a distance. For 1959, the Villager received round dual taillights set in \\"beltline\\" level chrome pods. In 1960, the Villager used taillights similar to the Ranger of that year. During its first year in production, Edsel sold more Villagers than Roundup and Bermuda station wagons combined. Despite overall declining Edsel sales in 1959, sales of the 1959 Villager (7,820 units) outpaced the combined three-model ranges of station wagon production in 1958 (6,470 units) by well over 1,000 vehicles. For 1960, Villager output dropped, directly attributable to Edsel's 43-day production cycle that began in mid-October 1959 and ended in late November 1959. The lowest production number for any Edsel station wagon during its three years was the 1960 nine-passenger Villager, with just 59 units built. The Villager name resurfaced at Mercury on a woodgrained Comet station wagon from 1962 to 1967, and subsequently on similarly trimmed wagons in other Mercury series, including the Montego (1970‚Äì1976), Bobcat (1974‚Äì1980 Canada, 1975‚Äì1980 U.S.), Cougar (1977 and 1982), Zephyr (1978‚Äì1981) and Lynx (1981‚Äì1984). From 1993 to 2002, the name was applied to Mercury's version of the Nissan Quest minivan.

With their unique musical style, they were major progenitors of the Hoboken indie-pop community, college radio favorites, and made the leap to national recognition with the advent of MTV. Their breakthrough song \\"Numbers with Wings\\" garnered the group a major cult following and was nominated at the first MTV Video Music Awards. Along with a handful of others, the Bongos were instrumental in the advancement of the Alternative Rock movement. History The Bongos grew out of a band called \\"a\\", which had included the three original Bongos and Glenn Morrow, who later formed the Individuals and helped found Bar/None Records. \\"a\\" was the first band to play Maxwell's, a rock and roll club in Hoboken. The group was led by Richard Barone on vocals and guitar and included Rob Norris, formerly of the Zantees on bass and Frank Giannini on drums. James Mastro, later of the Health & Happiness Show, joined the band as a guitarist after the release of their first LP. The group played extensively in Hoboken and New York City and toured the U.K. and Europe before touring in the U.S. The Bongos emerged from Hoboken, and Manhattan's new wave and no wave venues such as Tier 3 and the Mudd Club, with a guitar-driven pop that included a strong influence of avant-garde and propulsive dance music. One of their early excursions as a trio was backing up violinist Helen Hooke of the legendary group the Deadly Nightshade (one of the first all-woman rock bands of the 1970s) at Gerde's Folk City. Hooke was instrumental in helping the band create their first demo recording. Soon, well-reviewed shows at Hurrah, Danceteria, and later The Ritz established them as particularly effective live performers. What set them apart from other such groups of the era were their sudden guitar outbursts or saxophone improvisations that echoed the work of Lou Reed, Ornette Coleman, or Captain Beefheart within the context of a pure, melodic pop song. In addition, unlike many of their peers, the group explored unabashedly sensual dance rhythms that made their recordings dance-floor favorites. The Bongos at Compass Point Studios, Bahamas, during the recording of Phantom Train in 1985 While in London performing at The Rainbow Theatre, Dingwall's, and trendy Cabaret Futura, the Bongos recorded their early singles and their well-received debut EP Time and the River for UK-based Fetish Records. Cover designs for their Fetish releases were created by influential graphic artist Neville Brody, who was soon to become the designer of The Face magazine. The group's love of avant-garde performers brought them in touch with artists such as Throbbing Gristle and Clock DVA who performed with them live in London, and on their recordings. They recorded a version of the Marc Bolan song \\"Mambo Sun\\" in 1981 which briefly entered in the US \\"Dance Club Songs\\" Billboard Chart.Billboard Chart History: The Bongos \\"Mambo Sun\\", April 11, 1981 Their debut U.S. album, Drums Along the Hudson, compiled from the band's British singles, was released in 1982 to widely favorable reviews on both sides of the Atlantic. While Trouser Press suggested that the group \\"may trade a certain amount of substance for easy appeal,\\" it added that \\"there's no better musical equivalent of whipped cream anywhere.\\"Trouserpress.com Writing in the Village Voice, Robert Christgau dryly commented that \\"for all their jumpy originality [the songs are] still slight, and Richard Barone's lyrics are so oblique you have to wonder what his angle is.\\"Robertchristgau.com In 2007 however, Jim DeRegotis wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times: \\"The initial impression of naivet√© is offset by deceptively simple lyrics that actually hint at deep, dark mysteries and unfathomed mystical enigmas.\\"Suntimes.com The group's cover of T. Rex's \\"Mambo Sun\\" reached No. 22 on the Billboard Dance Chart. A thriving Hoboken pop scene emerged, triggered by the Bongos and Maxwell's, which gained national media attention, and drew many bands and fans to the city. An August 1, 1982 article in the New York Times Real Estate section hinted at the scene's popularity as an influence on increasing rents and property values.Nytimes.com After touring domestically in support of Drums Along the Hudson, including thirty concerts with The B-52s, Barone and Mastro retreated to Mitch Easter's \\"Drive-In Studios\\" in Winston- Salem, N.C. to record a their own, duo album entitled Nuts & Bolts. Co- produced by Easter, the album exhibited a more acoustic sound, and each side showcased the songs and lead vocals of either Barone or Mastro. In 1983, the group was signed to RCA Records, which subsequently released the album, Numbers With Wings. New York Times' critic Robert Palmer ‚Äî himself a former Hoboken-based musician with the Insect Trust ‚Äî marked this as the beginning of the Bongos' creative decline, lamenting the \\"slick, overproduced records which vitiated the raw vitality the group had originally displayed.\\"Nytimes.com Regardless, the album spawned a popular and inventive MTV video of the title song (nominated for 'Best Direction' on the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards, and the song itself remained at the number one spot on the College Music Journal (CMJ) chart for six consecutive weeks. The album also included the tribal, dance-floor hit \\"Barbarella.\\" A hectic tour schedule of over 300 shows a year sustained support at radio and MTV. Their Brazilian-influenced follow-up album, Beat Hotel, along with relentless touring, now with a further-expanded lineup including percussionist Steve Scales from Talking Heads, raised the Bongos' profile further and continued to increase their devoted cult following. It was in the midst of recording the Phantom Train album in Compass Point, Bahamas for Island Records that the band split up in 1987, with each member pursuing solo interests. The album was to remain unfinished and unreleased until 2013. Later work Richard Barone has subsequently released a series of well-received solo albums, including Glow released on September 14, 2010 on Hoboken's Bar/None Records, a 3-disc CD/DVD live collection 'cool blue halo' 25th Anniversary Concert on the DigSin label in 2012, and Sorrows & Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s in late 2016. He tours regularly and has also established a career as a recording and concert producer. Since 2011, Barone has been a professor at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music and more recently at The New School of Jazz and Contemporary Music. He serves on the Board of Governors for the Recording Academy/Grammys and on the advisory board of Anthology Film Archives. His memoir Frontman was published by Hal Leonard Books. James Mastro owns a popular guitar shop in Hoboken (\\"The Guitar Bar\\") and tours regularly as guitarist for Ian Hunter and for the reformed Mott the Hoople. Bassist Rob Norris plays in numerous groups including some offshoots of the Feelies, while drummer Frank Giannini pursues other interests and continues drumming on various projects. The Bongos appearing in 2009 at Maxwell's ‚Äì the first time in two decades In 2006, the original three Bongos re-entered the studio with longtime fan Moby producing to create bonus material for a CD reissue of the group's debut album. The remastered, 27-track special edition of Drums Along the Hudson, which was released internationally by Cooking Vinyl Records in June, 2007, includes rare, live bonus tracks and new studio recordings. An accompanying video for \\"Bulrushes 2007,\\" a remake of the band's early single \\"The Bulrushes\\" featuring Moby seen mixing the track, was released simultaneously on iTunes. The trio also reunited for two shows at Joe's Pub at The Public Theater in Greenwich Village in October 2006, and two more in February 2007. On September 30, 2007, the quartet played again in Hoboken for the first time in twenty years to an overflowing and appreciative crowd, and received a Proclamation from Mayor David Roberts commending them for their substantial contributions to Hoboken's culture and heritage. They headlined a day-long bill that featured the Chris Stamey Group, Glenn Mercer (formerly of the Feelies) and the Health and Happiness Show.

On March 11, 2009, the Bongos performed a full concert set at The City Winery in NYC following a tribute to their longtime friends R.E.M. held at Carnegie Hall, a benefit for music education programs. On October 22, 2009 the group returned to their home club Maxwell's for the first time since 1986, and subsequently performed at Manhattan's Hiro Ballroom, during the CMJ Music Marathon 2009 that same month (with longtime friends the Fleshtones). On January 25, 2010, the Bongos reunited once again at the City Winery, this time to benefit Emergency Earthquake Relief efforts in Haiti. Various members have joined Richard Barone onstage for his solo performances. Coming full-circle, the Bongos came together again on July 31, 2013 to perform the final concert at Maxwell's, which was closing after its long run. The original members had also performed the venue's first show. With a crowd spilling into the Hoboken streets, Barone announced that the group's \\"lost\\" album Phantom Train would finally be released on October 1, 2013. The group also promised a series of reunion shows to celebrate its release.. Marty Scott, co-founder of Jem Records announced that Phantom Train would be the first release of the reconstituted label. The album was remixed and prepared for release in summer, 2013 by Richard Barone and Steve Addabbo.

The original album cover graphics and photography, designed and hand-lettered by Emil Schult of Kraftwerk fame, were restored and used in the CD packaging. On June 8, 2015 the Bongos once again came together, this time with drummer Dennis Diken of the Smithereens, to perform and act as \\"house band\\" at public radio station WFUV's \\"Fare Thee Well\\" concert for beloved radio legend Vin Scelsa at City Winery, who was retiring from radio. Besides renditions of their own songs, the group backed David Johansen, Marshall Crenshaw, Southside Johnny, Stephen Trask (composer of Hedwig and the Angry Inch), David Bromberg, and others in a three-hour concert that was broadcast on the station on July 4, 2015. The group embarked on a mini-tour of the Northeast during October 2016 that paired them with West Coast power-pop band the Rubinoos. In early 2020 it was announced that The Bongos would perform in several select cities including Atlanta, Philadelphia, and New York to \\"celebrate four decades Hoboken Pop\\". Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, concerts were postponed until 2021.

It was the home ground of Newry City F.C. and is now the home ground of their successor club, Newry City A.F.C.. The stadium holds 7,949, but is currently restricted to 2,275 under safety legislation. The stadium is located in the Greenbank Industrial Estate on the Warrenpoint Road, close to the Down GAA stadium P√°irc Esler.  History  In 2009, The Showgrounds had two new stands constructed. In 2011, there were plans to turn The Showgrounds' pitch into an artificial turf pitch however due to Newry City's financial troubles, these plans were shelved. In 2012, on the eighteenth day of the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay, the Olympic torch passed The Showgrounds on its way to P√°irc Esler. In 2012, Newry City were liquidated after a High Court winding-up petition. Discussions on creating a phoenix club, initially titled \\"Newry City 2012\\" and eventually titled \\"Newry City AFC\\", took place at The Showgrounds. When Newry City was wound up, The Showgrounds were not sold off with the club as it was owned by Newry City's supporters and not the club. This meant that Newry City AFC would be able to use it as their home ground.  Usage  It was used to host Newry City's matches and also hosts the fixtures of Newry City AFC after Newry City was liquidated. It is also used for training. In 2013, The Showgrounds were suggested as a temporary home ground for Warrenpoint Town after they were promoted to the NIFL Premiership as their Milltown Playing Field did not fulfill the criteria for use in the NIFL Premiership. However, the Irish Football Association blocked the move as the owners of The Showgrounds objected. Newry City AFC also gave reasons for objecting the potential groundshare, citing the poor quality of the playing surface, the lack of a licence for The Showgrounds to host NIFL Premiership matches and a large increase in insurance and running costs for Newry City if the groundshare went ahead. The Showgrounds are also used to host the Bessbrook Cup Final, which is traditionally played on St. Stephen's Day. In 2013, the Bessbrook Cup final was postponed after one of The Showgrounds' floodlight pylons had been damaged in bad weather, which led to Health and Safety officials deeming that The Showgrounds were unsafe to be used for the match.  International football  The Showgrounds have been used to host youth international fixtures. In 2005, it was a venue in the 2005 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. In 2009, it was used to host some of the 2009 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification matches for Group 9.

This is where she had her first experiences in radio at student station Subcity Radio.Laura's DiaryProfile page on the Unofficial Scott Mills websiteUniversity of Glasgow, \\"Choose Glasgow Our Faculties Apply to Glasgow\\", page 21,  Radio 1  Laura started at Radio 1 by applying for a BBC Talent production traineeship with Jocelin Stainer from The Chris Moyles Show, near the end of the traineeship she started working on the Scott Mills show. She is well known for public stunts which have involved trying to get an ASBO, as well as becoming Radio 1's unofficial vigilante against non permit holders parking in disabled parking spaces or people who do not clean up after their dogs. Laura also appeared on CNN after filming a comical audition to become P Diddy's personal assistant where she dances for him and says, \\"I loved your work at the Diana concert, you were a-maz-in, you touched me so much and if i'm your PA you can touch me when ever you want, all the time.\\" As well as being an assistant, Laura occasionally produced shows for Scott Mills, JK and Joel and Sara Cox. At the end of March 2008, Laura was promoted to a new position within Radio 1 as producer of Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates' weekend shows, which includes the official chart show. For a time she was the assistant producer of the Nick Grimshaw show, Monday - Thursdays 10pm- midnight. She produced Huw Stephens' two Wednesday night shows and subsequently replaced producer Neil as Greg James' producer.  Laura's Diary  During October 2005, when the team were temporarily presenting The Chris Moyles Show, Laura's sister Mary Sayers (now Jones) who had found Laura's teenage diaries in her bedroom at her family house in York, was asked to read the diaries out on air. The team decided to carry this feature on again when they next covered for Moyles during January 2006 and began Season 2, entitled \\"The College Years\\". This season consisted of many weird and rude codes, and the revelation of her love of her piano teacher in 1996. 'Laura's Diary' became such a hit with Scott's listeners, it was moved to the afternoon show. Season 3 saw Laura meet Ben from her brother's band Monster Sunshine. They tried for a relationship but subsequently she moved to Glasgow for university. In Season 4, Laura talks of troubles at university and the woes of attempting to have a long distance relationship with Ben. The season ends with Ben dumping Laura by letter. Mills joked a couple of times during the readings that because Laura was \\"unlucky in love\\" he would make it his mission to help her. This led to the hit Radio 1 tour 'One Night With Laura' - an 'X Factor' style tour of the UK auditioning suitable boyfriends for Sayers. One Night With Laura Potential partners were asked to fill in a form on BBC Radio 1's website and, because of the success, in the last week of March 2006 a tour known as 'One Night with Laura' took place in Southampton, Cardiff, Nottingham, Newcastle and Glasgow. The contestants had to impress Laura, and a panel of judges, enough for those to decide that they were right for her. This included many strange occurrences such as a contestant lying on a bed of nails and asking Sayers to stand on his back. On the judging panel was Scott, Laura, her father Stephen and Mark \\"Chappers\\" Chapman. On the last two nights Chapman, who had other commitments, was replaced by Laura's sister, Mary Sayers, and Jo Whiley. The auditionees came and went and were whittled down to just four partners from each of the auditions in Southampton,The Scott Mills Show in Southampton Cardiff, Nottingham and Newcastle (nobody qualified from Glasgow). These were Ben, James, Gareth and Shep. James was the first person to be voted out by the public. Each of the final three were paraded on Radio 1 over a week of breakfast shows, participating in tasks and taking part in interviews to try to win over their all important votes. The final took place on 2006-04-07 and saw Gareth from Chard win the public vote. Even though he won the overall competition, after he and Laura spent a weekend in Paris together, it was clear Sayers believed him more of a friend than a boyfriend. She later began dating one of the original contestants (whom she eventually married), James Busson from Chichester. She'd earlier voiced her disappointment that James did not make it to the final.  Laura's Diary - The Book  Because of the success of the diary on Radio 1, Laura's Diary was released to the public as a book on Thursday 30 November 2006. It included entries not heard during the radio broadcasts.  Heart Radio  In July 2015 Laura left BBC Radio 1 to work for Heart Yorkshire as Programme Controller.http://radiotoday.co.uk/2015/07/laura-busson-appointed-heart- yorkshire-pc Under her leadership the station clocked up their highest ever listening figures according to RAJAR in August 2017.

It is home to the Norwegian First Division side Hamarkameratene (Ham-Kam) and is owned by Hamar Municipality. The venue has artificial turf, three stands and a capacity for 8,068 spectators. It was used for the 1938 Norwegian Football Cup Final‚Äîwhich saw the venue's record 14,500 spectators‚Äîand has also hosted five Norway national under-21 football team matches between 1984 and 2011. Construction started in 1934 and the venue opened on 28 June 1936 as the first home venue for Briskebyen FL. The club merged with Hamar AIL in 1946 to form Ham-Kam. The new club has played since 1970 played 22 seasons in the top tier, having been relegated eight times, most recently in 2008. Ham-Kam's record home attendance is 11,500, dating from a 1976 match against Lillestr√∏m. In 1984, the club house was rebuilt with luxury boxes and a new 2,400-seat East Stand was built. The investments lead the club into financial distress, and in 1993 the municipality had to purchase the venue to save the club. Planning of a new or upgraded venue started in 2001, construction started in 2007 and the first stage was completed the following year. It cost 111 million Norwegian krone (NOK), having suffered large cost overruns. History Briskeby during a match in the 1930s Construction and early years Freidig was established in 1918 as a local team for Briskebyen in what was then the municipality of Vang.Gjerd√•ker (1998): 52 At the time there was a severe lack of pitches in Hamar, so the club was forced to sneak into unused venues and play until they were chased by the groundskeeper. The club was accepted as a member of the Football Association of Norway (NFF) in 1927, changing its name to Briskebyen FL. This forced it to formalize its pitch renting so it would have a single home venue for each season. In 1928 and 1929, it played at Vangsbanen, from 1930 through 1933 at Ottestad bane, and from 1934 at Hamar stadion. As the club was dissatisfied with this arrangement, it launched plans to establish its own venues. First it needed to secure a lot, and in the late 1920s lied its eyes on a parcel of land owned by Hamar Jernst√∏peri. However, the lot was sold to Oplandske Kreditbank in 1930 and the club had to negotiate purchasing the lot from the bank. The club established a new committee to look into the stadium issue. Hamar IL was invited to become part-owner of the venue, but they chose to remain at Hamar stadion. As Briskebyen was not able to secure a partner to share the costs with, opposition towards the project grew within the club. Yet, the decision to build the venue was taken by Briskebyen FL's annual meeting on 15 April 1934, with construction starting on 26 April. The venue's terraces in 1945 The venue was estimated to cost NOK 26,500. Financing included a NOK 3,000 grant from NFF, NOK 1,500 from the municipality and NOK 1,800 from the club.Gjerd√•ker (1998): 53 The rest was secured through various charity events, 320 of 1,500-man-days being volunteer work and a NOK 8,000 loan from NFF. Construction in 1934 consisted of removing of earthwork and laying sewer pipes. The following year, of rock was blasted and the pitch was sown on 3 and 4 September. Construction of the terraces and dressing rooms took place in 1936. Work was not concluded until the morning of the inauguration match on 28 June 1936, when the last fence was mounted. Briskeby was the first grass pitch in Hedmark and was inaugurated with a match against Lyn, who won 4‚Äì1. The venue cost NOK 32,036.28, leaving the club with a debt of NOK 18,688.93. The venue was awarded the 1938 Norwegian Football Cup Final, which required additional upgrades, largely conducted through volunteer work. The venue was confiscated by the German occupation forces during World War II, who built a cold storage facility south of the pitch. In 1945, after five years of occupation, the pitch was in a detrimental state. The stadium received a major renovation, including a new pitch and replacing half the wooden terraces with concrete stands. The cold facility was converted to a club house and a basement was dug out and used as a changing room. In 1946, parts of Vang, including Briskebyen, were amalgamated with Hamar.Gjerd√•ker (1998): 105 The same year, Hamar Municipality signed an agreement with the club whereby municipal subsidies would cover the operating costs in exchange for the club allocating training time to other clubs.Gjerd√•ker (1998): 217 The old club house and luxury boxes installed in 1984 Debt and municipalization In 1982, the club decided that it would build a new 2,400-seat stand on the eastern long side. A low construction cost was secured because the construction industry was going through a slump. The costs were covered by NOK 2.5 million in national lottery grants and NOK 2 million in loan, which was planned to be repaid through increased sponsor and ticket revenues from increased attendance.Gjerd√•ker (1998): 225 The upgrade also included a reconstruction of the club house to facilitate luxury boxes. They were made available for sponsors, who were allowed to bring guests. The boxes and the vestibule became an important informal meeting area for the town's political and business elite.Gjerd√•ker (1998): 275 The new stand became a financial burden for the club. Operating costs increased after Norwegian clubs were allowed to wage players from 1984. In addition, interest rates rose quickly, making the club unable to meet its financial obligations. At the same time, the club experienced falling attendance. In 1985, the club's auditor warned that the club was heading into financial distress. In 1986, the club spent NOK 1 million to build terraces between the club house and the pitch on the northern short side, and terraces on the southern short side. In 1990, Hamar Municipality gave Ham-Kam a grant of NOK 1.7 million in an attempt to save the club's finances, in part because of the club's debt on the venue. In 1993, Ham-Kam proposed selling the stadium, including its lot, for NOK 6 million, to pay off its debt. In addition, NFF required that the stadium be renovated for NOK 2 million. The club launched the sales plans to the municipality in September 1993, stating that if they did not purchase the venue, the club would probably be forced to file for bankruptcy. At the time, Lillestr√∏m and Brann were the only other top division clubs to own their own stadiums. Ham-Kam's three star players, Vegard Skogheim, Petter Belsvik and St√•le Solbakken, threatened to sign with other clubs within days unless the municipality saved the club. The old West Stand On 20 October 1993, the municipal council voted in favor of purchasing the stadium. The proposal was supported by the Labour Party and Centre Party, who had 28 of 49 councilors, but opposed by the rest of the council. Along with two banks, the municipality established a limited company which would own the venue. The municipality and banks would pay for the club's debt of NOK 5.4 million, and take over the stadium's operating costs of roughly NOK 1 million per year. Ham-Kam would have to pay rent on the stadium. The transaction took place on 26 January 1994,Lynx (2011): 39 and included a clause granting Ham-Kam the right to buy back the stadium at a later date.Lynx (2011): 44 The municipality issued a loan of NOK 4 million to Ham-Kam in 2003 to allow them to install floodlighting at Briskeby. Arena By 2001 NFF was in the process of implementing new stadium requirements in the top leagues, and Briskeby would no longer be permitted to be used in the top tier.Lynx (2011): 33 Ham-Kam entered an alliance with Totalprosjekt‚Äîa real estate development company working on Lillestr√∏m's √Ör√•sen Stadion‚Äîwho presented a concept to finance a new venue: The municipality would transfer property to a limited company jointly owned by the municipality and the major sports clubs, the real estate would be re-regulated to increase their value, and the company would use this capital to build a new professional and a new recreational stadium.Lynx (2011): 34 Parallel with this, a municipal commission made a report that recommended a consolidation in the number of venues in town and the conversion of gravel and grass fields to artificial turf. The commission recommended that a new professional football venue be built either at Briskeby or Hamar stadion.Lynx (2011): 35 Hamar Sportsanlegg (HSA) was established in 2003 to execute the plan. It was owned 34 percent by the municipality, and 22 percent each by Ham-Kam, Hamar IL and Storhamar Dragons. In 2004, Storhamar's share was transferred to Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, a municipal company which owns Vikingskipet Olympic Arena and Hamar Olympic Amphitheater.Lynx (2011): 36 A report estimated the technical value of Briskeby to NOK 6 million,Lynx (2011): 43 while the sales price of the lot was estimated at NOK 30 million. The municipal council voted on 18 February 2004 to transfer the ownership of the two stadiums to the new company. Ham-Kam rented the venues from HSA, with HSA's deficit for the first four years being covered by the municipality. Of the NOK 20.8 million in value transferred to the company, NOK 14.5 million was paid by HSA taking over the municipality's obligation to build a new athletics venue should Hamar stadion be closed,Lynx (2011): 45 and NOK 5 million was debt.Lynx (2011): 46 The venue in 2007 In October 2004, Totalprosjekt presented the concept Skibladner Stadion, which would have been located on Tjuvholmen, a peninsula which sticks out into Mj√∏sa.Lynx (2011): 48 In addition to a 9,000-seat stadium, the project included a cultural center with an 800-seat auditorium and a 22-story hotel. However, Tjvuholmen is a popular recreational areas and a process to regulate the area as such had just been completed. The location would also cause problems for the railway, who wanted to expand Hamar Station. The Tjvuholmen project was rejected by the municipal executive committee on 8 December, and on 16 March 2005, the municipal council voted to continue working on a new venue at Briskeby. This caused Totalproject to leave the project.Lynx (2011): 49 In 2004,Lynx (2011): 87 Biong Arkitekter was contracted to design the stadium, with Bygger√•d as structural engineers. Five proposals for Briskeby were launched, estimated to cost between NOK 61 and 150 million. Three of them retained the current alignment and would give a capacity of between 8,800 and 10,200 spectators, and two of these again contained commercial and residential properties within the stadium complex. The two other proposals involved turning the pitch 90 degrees, which would give the least encroachment on neighbor properties.Lynx (2011): 50 The residents' association demanded that an impact study be made and that more specific plans be presented before municipal approval. The municipality concluded that neither were required.Lynx (2011): 51 The municipal council passed a regulation plan on 1 February 2006, which involved building a 10,200 seat venue, but with the smaller of the two possible commercial property sizes.Lynx (2011): 54 The residents' association appealed to the county governor, who reject the appeal on 1 September.Lynx (2011): 56 The organizational structure of Hamar SportsanleggAt the time NFF awarded an annual license to clubs which permitted them to play in the top two divisions. This included a series of criteria that the home venue needed to meet. As Briskeby was severely substandard to the criteria, Ham-Kam was required to apply for annual exemptions. These were only awarded to clubs who were actively working on upgrading or building new venues. If an exception was not granted, the club would either be relegated to the Second Division (the third tier), or would have to play their home games at an approved stadium in another town.Lynx (2011): 64 In December 2006,Lynx (2011): 59 HSA sold Briskeby to a new company, Briskeby Gressbane AS (BG), which was owned 50 percent each by Ham-Kam and HSA. Another company, Briskeby Eiendom 1 AS (BE1), was established and owned 66 percent by HSA and 34 percent by BG. The latter was also given 50 percent of the shares in Hamar stadion.Lynx (2011): 60 BG was non-commercial and was to own the stadium itself, while BE1 was commercial and was to rent out the commercial property. The two shared board, managing director and accountant.Lynx (2011): 114 In May 2007, NCC was awarded the contract to build the new venue by BG and BE1. Although NCC was NOK 8 million more expensive than the cheapest bid, they offered four months shorter construction time.Lynx (2011): 62 Briskeby's lot needed to be expanded, which was done by purchasing neighbor lots for NOK 34 million.Lynx (2011): 66 Hamar stadion and the neighbor lot Fuglsetmyra were sold for NOK 295 million in June 2007, of which NOK 9 million was paid to BG and another NOK 175 million was a guarantee which would be paid after the lot was re-regulated.Lynx (2011): 73 Construction was financed through a loan of NOK 218 million from Handelsbanken, which was secured on the revenue which would be generated from the sale of Hamar stadion and Fuglsetmyra. However, the bank was not willing to lend money secured on the basis of sales price of Hamar stadion being based on the re-regulation of the lot. The municipality was pressed on time by the possibility of NFF denying Ham-Kam the right to play at Briskeby. Hamar Energi Holding AS (HEH), which owns Hamar Municipality's share of Eidsiva Energi, had large assets. Both HEH and BE1 had as chair Hans Kolstad, who proposed that HEH could issue a guarantee of NOK 75 million for BG and BE1‚Äîwhich was issued in September 2007.Lynx (2011): 80 This allowed construction to start, but the project was still under-financed by NOK 50 million. HEH therefore issued another guarantee the same month, for NOK 58.75 million.Lynx (2011): 81 Because of delays in the regulation work, HEH issued another two guarantees, NOK 60 million in March and NOK 25 million in June 2008.Lynx (2011): 82 The East Stand after the reconstruction In August 2007, the stadium was planned to be built in three stages, with a combined budget of NOK 156.6 million. The first stage would involve the northern and western sides and cost NOK 78.4 million, the second stage would involve the eastern side and cost NOK 43.0 million, while the third stage would involve the southern side and cost NOK 35.1 million.Lynx (2011): 261 After construction started, BG changed two specifications, moving public rest rooms from the basement to the ground floor, and changing the angle of roof. Both of these gave increased construction costs and alteration of the architectural design plans.Lynx (2011): 83 During this entire period, BE1 was insolvent. The bank, therefore, required that the entire sales price of Hamar stadion be transferred to BG, even though NOK 50 million was to go to the construction of B√∏rstad Idrettspark (BIP). Therefore, Hamar Municipality decided to finance BIP to secure sufficient funding for Briskeby, essentially subsidizing Briskeby with a further NOK 50 million. In 2007, BG paid NOK 3.4 million in compensation to Ham-Kam for lost ticket sales during the construction time and for the club house, which would be demolished.Lynx (2011): 85 In 2008, Ham-Kam tried to sell the naming rights of the stadium for between NOK 5 and 8 million per year, but neither of their main sponsors, Eidsiva Energi and Sparebanken Hedmark, were interested. The first stage of the stadium opened on 10 August 2008, after which further construction was terminated. Stage one cost NOK 92.5 million to build and NOK 19 million for purchase of real estate. By April 2010, BG had combined negative assets, debt and received grants of NOK 240 million. Of this, NOK 78 million was written-off bad debts to BE1 and NOK 19 million was purchase of lots.Lynx (2011): 262 On 25 September 2009, Hamar Municipality bought HSA, BG, BIP and BE1 for NOK 73,000.Lynx (2011): 106 In December 2009, the municipality increased the share capital in BG with NOK 16 million and in BE1 with NOK 32 million.Lynx (2011): 97 The new West Stand With then opening of the venue, Ham-Kam rented , consisting of of lounges and for its offices, for which the team played NOK 2 to 3 million per year. In the 2010 season, Ham-Kam played in the Second Division, resulting in the entire VIP area remaining unused. Artificial turf was laid on the stadium in August 2011. In August 2011, an investigation of the HSA affair was initiated by the municipality, with the investigation costing NOK 7 million. The report concluded that a large number of illegal action had been taken in the process: HSA had used money reserved for sport for commercial development; irregular executive work in HEH and lack of correction were conducted after errors were discovered in 2007; important instructions from the municipal council were not followed; illegal executive work was undertaken in the holding companies; BE1 did not file for bankruptcy after it had lost its equity; the use of an unnecessarily complex company structure; violation on the laws of public sector procurements; violation on European Economic Area law on public grants; expensive consulting contracts, without tender, which gave the consultants too much influence on the process; and that the board composition in the companies was in violation with good corporate governance practices. Facilities The East Stand opened in 1984 The new section of Briskeby has the same style and building materials as the two other main sports venues in Hamar, Vikingskipet and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, which were built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. The venue has capacity for 8,068 spectators and has club seating 600 people. The pitch is artificial turf. Around the pitch are 180 digital advertising board. There are two scoreboard screens. The stands have 13 concession stands, all which are built to allow a view of the pitch while standing in a queue. Events 1938 Cup Final between Fredrikstad and Mj√∏ndalen The venue was home ground for Briskebyen from its opening. In its inaugural season, the club was newly relegated to Class B, as most of the club's effort had gone to building the venue. From 1937 the club again played in Class A. The venue was also used for matches where a mixed Briskebyen and Hamar IL played friendlies against foreign teams.Gjerd√•ker (1998): 54 No official matches were played during the Second World War. In April 1946, Briskebyen FL merged with Hamar AIL to create Hamarkameratene. Ham-Kam remained at lower levels in the league system until the 1960s, when it was promoted to the Second Division (then the second tier) after the 1967 season. Ham-Kam was promoted to the First Division (then the top tier) ahead of the 1970 season. They have since played in the top league in the periods 1970‚Äì74, 1976‚Äì77, 1979, 1981‚Äì84, 1986‚Äì87, 1992‚Äì95, 2004‚Äì06 and 2008.Fagerli and Lunde (1999): 349 The club's eight relegation from the top league is a Norwegian record. After the 2009 season, the club was further relegated to the Second Division, but returned to the First Division (now the second tier) in 2011. For a Ham-Kam match, the record attendance is 11,500, which dates from 27 May 1976 league match against Lillestr√∏m. The venue hosted the 1938 Norwegian Football Cup Final on 16 October 1938, where Fredrikstad beat Mj√∏ndalen 3‚Äì2. The match attracted 14,500 spectators, which still stands as Briskeby's record attendance. Briskeby has hosted five Norway national under-21 football team matches, having played 0‚Äì0 against Poland on 28 August 1984, 3‚Äì0 against Switzerland on 2 June 1992, 2‚Äì1 against Switzerland on 16 August 2005, 2‚Äì1 against Hungary on 28 May 2010 and 1‚Äì4 against Sweden on 2 June 2011.

It is sometimes regarded as being part of the Kunlun Mountains, although physically it is more closely connected to the Pamirs. It is also one of the relatively easier 7,000 m peaks in the world to climb, due to its gentle western slope and the comparatively drier weather of Xinjiang, though a thorough acclimatization period and a very strong physical condition are crucial for success. Location Muztagh Ata (Turkish: Muz Dag); modern pronunciation Buz Dag (as in \\"men\\" versus \\"ben\\"- where Oguz Kaan lost his horse according to the legend) lies just south of Kongur Tagh, the highest peak of this somewhat isolated range that is separated from the main chain of the Kunlun by the large Yarkand River valley, and thus generally included in the \\"Eastern Pamirs\\". Not far to the north and east of this group are the lowlands of the Tarim Basin and the Taklamakan Desert. The Karakoram Highway passes very close to both peaks as well as Karakul Lake, from which the mountain is conveniently viewed. The closest city is to the mountain is Tashkurgan, the westernmost town in China and very close to the border with Pakistan. History According to Michael Witzel, \\"the ·πögveda mentions the mountain M≈´javant (‚ÄúHaving M≈´ja‚Äù), from where the best soma comes. A Mu≈æa tribe is also found in the Avesta in an eastern area that has vedic-like names. The name seems to survive as the impressive 7,549-meter-high Muzh Tagh Ata Mountain in the Kirghiz and Sariqoli (Saka) lands of southwestern Xinjiang.\\" The Swedish explorer and geographer Sven Hedin made the first recorded attempt to climb Muztagh Ata, in 1894. Additional attempts were made in 1900, 1904 and 1947, the last by the team of Eric Shipton and Bill Tilman who came very close to the summit but were turned back due to cold and deep snow. The first ascent of the peak was in 1956 by a large party of Chinese and Soviet climbers (including Liu Lianman and Xu Jing) led by E.A. Beletskiy, via the west ridge, which is now the standard route. Since the first ascent, many ascents of Muztagh Ata have been made. In 1980, a party led by Ned Gillette made a ski ascent/descent of the standard route, the first ski ascent of a mountain over . An ascent of the much harder south-east ridge was made in 200 and a secondary route at the west side of the mountain was first climbed in the summer of 2005. 2011 the Swedish climber Anneli Wester camped on the summit overnight after climbing the mountain solo and alpine style.

The neighborhood is in the western section of the city, roughly between Fremont Avenue and McCulloh Street, extending from Dolphin Street to Bloom Street. Its principal thoroughfare is Pennsylvania Avenue. Located within the Old West Baltimore Historic District, Upton has historically been one of the economic, political and cultural centers of the city's black community. In the early 21st century, it is the focus of the city's urban revitalization programs. History At the turn of the 20th century, Upton was one of the most affluent African American neighborhoods in the United States. The Pennsylvania Avenue commuter rail station on the Baltimore and Potomac Rail Road was built in 1884. By the 1920s, Upton was home to most educated African-American property owners in Baltimore. To its south and west were the poor and working class African-American neighborhoods of \\"The Bottom,\\" and to its east were German-American and Jewish-American neighborhoods. Bethel AME Church, 1300 Druid Hill Avenue Pennsylvania Avenue was the premiere shopping strip for black Baltimoreans, inspiring comparisons to Lenox Avenue in Harlem. It was home to professionals such as doctors and lawyers, retailers who served a middle class and upscale clientele, jazz clubs, dance halls, theaters, and other public and private institutions for the black community. Cab Calloway grew up in Upton, and Eubie Blake performed his debut in a club on Pennsylvania Avenue. The Royal Theater, at Pennsylvania and Lafayette, became a mainstay on the Chitlin Circuit. Upton was a base for much of the local and national civil rights movement. Booker T Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Marcus Garvey all visited local churches. The Baltimore chapter of the NAACP was based in Upton when it was developed. In the mid-20th century, Upton's population swelled due to the popularity of the neighborhood and the pressures of state racial segregation that kept African Americans confined to certain areas in the city. Single family homes were subdivided into small apartments, and Pennsylvania Avenue's sidewalks were crowded on Saturday nights. Loud music and heavy drinking became popular vices of the newer Upton residents. Upper-income black families began abandoning the area for neighborhoods away from the center of the city, as part of the suburbanization under way in many cities. In the 1960s and '70s, controversial urban renewal projects destroyed much of Upton's historic architecture, especially in the southwestern portion of the neighborhood. The city constructed public housing projects to accommodate more people but did not replace all the units that were lost. In addition, once the historic buildings were razed, it was difficult to secure developers to build new construction. The Royal Theater was demolished in 1971. Marble Hill The eastern section of the neighborhood, relatively untouched by urban renewal, was declared a national historic district in 1985. This area is today known as Marble Hill. It contains many historic rowhouses of the Queen Anne and Italianate styles, featuring high ceilings, decorative ironwork, and white marble steps. Transportation Upton is about a fifteen- minute walk from Downtown Baltimore. It is served by the Baltimore Metro Subway with the Upton/Avenue Market Metro Subway Station underneath the corners of Pennsylvania and Laurens Street. Bus Route 7 runs along Pennsylvania Avenue, and Routes 5 and 21 run near the neighborhood. Upton in the 21st century The Avenue Market sells produce and holds occasional events such as jazz shows. According to the city, 60% of Upton families with children under 5 are living in poverty. The median home sale price in Upton in 2004 (not including Marble Hill) was $28,054. Many of the rowhouses in the neighborhood are vacant, either abandoned by their property owners or owned by the city.

It consists of 20 members; 14 representatives of the villages and 6 elected on a common roll. Members are directly elected by universal suffrage, and serve a three-year term. Niue follows the Westminster system of government, with the Premier elected by the Assembly and the Cabinet drawn from it. History The Assembly is descended from the Island Council established under the Cook Islands Act 1915. This was disbanded in 1959 and reconstituted as the Assembly, which was successively granted greater control.Island Territories: Niue Island in Te Ara: An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A. H. McLintock, originally published in 1966. The Assembly assumed full law-making power within the constitution upon self-government in 1974. The Assembly is physically located in Alofi. Speaker of the Assembly The Assembly is presided over by a Speaker, elected by its members from outside their ranks. If a member of the Assembly is elected Speaker, they must resign their seat.Constitution of Niue, article 20 (3). The Speaker does not vote in proceedings, and does not enjoy a casting vote. The current Speaker is Hima Douglas. Elections Elections are held under a simple plurality system, with electors in the fourteen villages electing one member per village by majority vote, and six members from a common roll.

Formed after the Norfolk Island Act 1979 was passed in the Australian parliament, its first members were elected on 10 August 1979. The last assembly was the 14th, elected on 13 March 2013. On 17 June 2015, the Australian government abolished the assembly, ending self-government on the island. Norfolk Island Regional Council, a local government body with significantly-restricted powers, was established in July 2016 to perform local-level governance on the island. Membership The assembly had 9 members, elected for a three-year term. The assembly was elected by a popular vote for a term of not more than three years. Electors each had nine equal votes, which could be divided in any way between candidates, but no more than two votes could be given to any particular individual candidate. This variation of cumulative voting is called the \\"weighted first past the post system\\". All nine seats were held by independents, as Norfolk Island did not have major political parties. However, a local branch of the Australian Labor Party was active. On 20 March 2013, the first meeting of the 14th Legislative Assembly elected Chief Minister, Speaker and Deputy Speaker: *Lisle Snell - Chief Minister *Robin Eleanor Adams - Minister for Cultural Heritage and Community Services *Ronald John Ward - Minister for Environment *Timothy John Sheridan - Minister for Finance *Melissa Ward *David Buffett AM - Speaker *David Raymond Porter *Ronald Coane Nobbs - Deputy Speaker *Hadyn Paul Evans Abolition In March 2015, the Australian government announced that the Assembly would be replaced with a regional council, as part of a plan to bring the governance of Norfolk Island into line with the rest of Australia. A five- person Community Advisory Council would be set up to manage the transition, with Chief Minister Snell and Speaker Buffett being invited to be members. In 2014, Snell travelled to Canberra to argue against a complete change to the arrangements governing the island. He did not oppose the island joining Australia's tax and welfare system, but maintained that it should retain similar powers to a state or territory government. Snell's overtures and a non-binding referendum held on the island were unsuccessful, and the assembly met for the last time on 17 June 2015. After a transition period of more than a year, local government power was officially returned to Norfolk Island with the establishment of Norfolk Island Regional Council on 1 July 2016, with the Commonwealth continuing to govern the island for all but local-level matters.

It is part of the West Valley‚ÄìMission Community College District. The land the college is on was bought between 1966 and 1967. Mission College opened for it first year in 1975. In 1979 hit had grown to \\"3,500 students, 8 administrators, and 73 instructors\\". History The Mission College Interim Campus was housed on the site of the vacant Jefferson Middle School at the corner of Monroe Street and Lawrence Express in Santa Clara, California in early September, 1975. From this humble beginning, three members originally appointed for full-time duty‚ÄîTeri Chiang (Mathematics), Don Joslen (Fine Arts), and Son Le (Philosophy)) worked with Administrator Burt Hermosillo with the support of several part-time faculty volunteers from West Valley College to offer morning and evening classes. By summer, 1976, the Governing Board had appointed Warren Sorenson as founding president. Mission College's first Commencement took place in June, 1977 with the President of Santa Clara University as Commencement Speaker. Notably, among a handful of graduates for Mission College Class '77 was Eddie Sousa who was later elected Mayor of Santa Clara. The birth of Mission College seemed uneventful; its full development was not, however. Reported disputes over noise levels at West Valley College with its Saratoga residents helped changed the membership of the long-serving Governing Board, leading in upper management changes at both West Valley and Mission Colleges soon after the new Mission College campus was completed in 1979. Even though the departure of its founding president was unexpected, among many legacies of his was Mission College's commitment students as individual learners: individualized self-paced learning, decades before the advent of the digital revolution and cyber learning. The 12 acres of land that was today's Mission College was bought in Santa Clara in between 1966 and 1967. Later, by 1970, 164 acres of land in total was bought and acquired. The first piece of the Mission College Interim Campus construction plan was completed during 1979, which is also the start of the 1979‚Äì80 academic year, which enrolled about 3,500 students, 8 administrators, and 73 instructors. The Mission College Interim Campus was renamed West Valley-Mission Community College District in September 1985. By that time, Mission College has prided itself for having a large diversity of academic learning approaches. The campus' architecture was also designed to increase interaction among its students and faculty, which results in a more effective learning environment. The college has hosted a number of speakers, including Pulitzer Prize winning author Sonia Nazario, Civil Rights activist Cornel West, Tuskegee Airman Les Williams, and former Santa Clara Assistant District Attorney Rolanda Pierre Dixon. The college's art department also hosts exhibits at its Vargas Gallery in the Gillmor Center. The Mission College Symphony is celebrating its 10th season in 2016‚Äì17. The Hospitality Management program runs lunch service on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Formerly called the Owl Cove, it is now called the Mission Bistro. The restaurant was renovated between 2009 and 2012. Organization and administration Mission College is part of Silicon Valley's West Valley‚ÄìMission Community College District, which also administers West Valley College in nearby Saratoga, California. It is part of the California Community Colleges System. The district serves the cities of Saratoga,Campbell, Los Gatos, Morgan Hill, Monte Sereno, Santa Clara, and San Jose. The district's headquarters are on the campus of West Valley College. Campus Interior of the Main Building The college originally was focused on a single large structure where most of the classes took place. In 2014, the Gillmor Family Center opened, with classrooms and labs on three floors. The library, cafeteria, and bookstore are in nearby buildings. A separate building houses the science departments. The Hospitality Management building includes the \\"Mission Bistro\\", which serves lunch on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the Fall and Spring semesters. The campus is immediately north of the Mercado shopping center and west of facilities of EMC and McAfee. The Campus is also located relatively close to Levi Station and Great America. In May 2014 the Gillmor Center opened, named after former Santa Clara mayor Gary Gillmor. The building houses 50 percent of the college's class room and is a LEED Gold Building. Gillmor was the city's first elected mayor and helped facilitate the land sale that eventually became Mission College. Its parking lot hosts 2,640 high-efficiency SunPower solar panels, which are estimated to save the college $9 million in the next 25 years following 2011. In January 2011 the school opened its new Child Development Center preschool. A new main building was under construction through 2017 and it was originally announced to be ready by Spring 2018. Ultimately the building, the Student Engagement Center, was opened on January 24, 2018. Transportation Campus Center Mission College is reached from the California's Great America exit of U.S. Route 101. There are shuttles that are reachable with walks of a few blocks that connect to the Old Ironsides station of the Santa Clara VTA Light-rail, the Great America station of the Altamont Corridor Express, and the Lawrence station of Caltrain. VTA bus lines 57 and 60 stop in the college's front loop. While the new main building is under construction, VTA bus lines 57 and 60 stop in a section in the college's parking lot.

The name of the house was changed from the Legislative Council of the Turks and Caicos Islands to its present name following the implementation of the new constitution on 9 August 2006. In August 2009, the United Kingdom suspended the Turks and Caicos' self- government after allegations of ministerial corruption. The prerogative of the ministerial government and the House of Assembly were vested in the islands' governor until a general election was held in November 2012. Composition The House of Assembly has 21 members in total. Formerly, 15 members were elected for a four-year term in single-seat constituencies (of which 11 lay in the Caicos Islands and 4 in the Turks Islands), while 3 members sat ex officio, 3 were appointed members and a speaker was chosen from outside the house. Although the number of elected representatives to the body was not changed during the 2009-12 suspension of self-government, the composition was changed so that ten of the 15 elected representatives are elected to individual districts, while five are now elected at-large. Consultative Forum (2009-2012) Following the suspension of self-government in August 2009, the Governor assembled a Consultative Forum for the Turks and Caicos Islands to advise him on legislation relating to the territory. The forum consisted of the Chief Executive, the Attorney-General, the Permanent Secretary for Finance, and eleven to fifteen representatives of the community, appointed by the Governor. The council could make non-binding recommendations to the Governor about bills that were presented to it and on policies that were referred to it.

Torbothie is very close to Springhill and Dykehead, two larger sections of Shotts. Torbothie means \\"the bothie on the hill\\". History There were once 22 mines in Shotts, a few of which were in Torbothie, Southfield for example was one, but they were shut down in the 1960s.  Torbothie culture and wildlife  The local wildlife is varied, ranging from local birds to animals like foxes, and roe deer. Rabbits are not uncommon, and domestic pets, such as dogs, are frequently found. Badgers have been sighted, as well as rats, small ferrets and weasels, and the occasional squirrel. There have also been one or two reports of adders. Torbothie is populated generally by mixed class families. Its culture is mostly made up by white Scots.  The Voe  The Voe is a man-made body of water situated near the Torbothie Club, next to a quarry. It was created by damming the upper Calder water to create a source of cooling for the now-demolished Shotts ironworks and brass foundry. Abandoned and ruined stone structures are dotted around it. It is suitable for fishing, with common fish including pike and perch. Young people often ride their bikes to the beach. It is currently believed to be undergoing a makeover with 1400 houses planned for its future, a project estimated at ¬£85m.http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/wishaw-news/local- wishaw-news/wishaw-news/2009/12/02/85m-torbothie-development-bid-nears- reality-76495-25298507/  Economy  The businesses in Torbothie are mostly limited to a butcher's shop, however, in the centre of Shotts there is a local supermarket, print shop, two garages, a pharmacy and several take aways and small convenience shops scattered throughout Shotts.

During his years in Major League Baseball, he played for five different teams. Beginning his career with the Boston Americans, his final professional game was played with the New York Giants on June 6, 1915. McLean was one of the tallest catchers in major league history. Known for his heavy drinking and violent behavior, McLean's career ended after a 1915 brawl with New York Giants manager John McGraw and coach Dick Kinsella. He was fatally shot by a bartender six years after his last major league appearance. Early life McLean was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick. He earned the nickname Larry after the alternate moniker ascribed to Nap Lajoie, a star baseball player who McLean was said to resemble. In 1901, while McLean and Fred Mitchell were playing for a local team in Saint John, New Brunswick, they were scouted and signed by the fledgling Boston Red Sox. Playing career On December 12, 1903, McLean was traded from the Cubs to the Cardinals in what has been described as \\"one of the worst trades in Cardinals history.\\" McLean and Jack Taylor were traded to the Cardinals in exchange for future Baseball Hall of Fame member Three Finger Brown and Jack O'Neill. McLean was known to chew large amounts of Brown's Mule tobacco and was a heavy drinker of corn whiskey. When he signed with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League in 1905, he became teammates with a pitcher who also struggled with alcohol use, Ned Garvin. Baseball author Dennis Snelling said that this pitcher-catcher combination formed \\"one of the most volatile batteries in the history of the game.\\" McLean in 1905 In 1906, McLean signed with Portland again for a $1400 annual salary. McLean's wife publicly voiced her objection to the salary, and she said that Portland owner William Wallace McCredie was not paying McLean consistent with his value. She said that the minor-league team in Altoona was willing to sign him for $2400 per year. McLean did play in 88 games for the 1906 Portland Beavers and he hit .355. The team won the Pacific Coast League; the second-place team was 21 games out of first place. A drinking incident with Cincinnati that year ended with McLean jumping in the fountain at the Buckingham Hotel, and it resulted in McLean being demoted back to the minor leagues by manager Kid Nichols. \\"I can pitch to Larry real good, but I can't manage him worth a dime,\\" Nichols said. Before the 1910 season, the Reds suspended McLean after he violated team rules during spring training at Hot Springs, Arkansas. In response to the suspension, McLean wrote a \\"letter of resignation\\" from the club. His resignation was accepted, but he was later allowed to rejoin the team with the caveats that he would play for a reduced salary and would sit out the first week of the regular season. In August 1913, McLean was traded from the St. Louis Cardinals to the New York Giants in exchange for Doc Crandall. Chief Meyers was the Giants' primary catcher, but he was injured during the 1913 postseason, so McLean played five games in the 1913 World Series. McLean was the first player born in New Brunswick to appear in a World Series. Career-ending fight In June 1915, McLean engaged in a brawl with Giants manager John McGraw and scout Dick Kinsella. McLean had recently been suspended for ten days for failing to stay in shape. He was angry at Kinsella because he felt the scout had convinced McGraw to suspend him. McLean and several companions entered the lobby of the team's hotel and attacked Kinsella. The melee escalated and Kinsella broke a chair over McLean's head while several team members worked to subdue McLean. The catcher and his companions fled in a car. McGraw dismissed McLean from the Giants later that day.McLean on a rampage; attacks scout Kinsella and McGraw banishes him from Giants. The New York Times. June 12, 1915. Retrieved October 29, 2012. McLean's playing time had been in decline since 1913. Despite McLean's attempts to regain his place on the team, Chief Meyers fully took over the team's catching responsibilities after McLean's dismissal and McLean did not appear in another major league game. In his thirteen-year career, McLean posted a .262 batting average, which included six home runs and 298 RBIs in 862 games played. Death McLean was killed on March 24, 1921 in Boston, where he was shot by the manager of a saloon. He had become unruly the night before his death and chased a bartender out of the saloon. When McLean returned on the night of March 24, he became offended when the manager refused to give him a cigarette. The manager said that McLean was attempting to crawl over the bar, aided by his friend Jack McCarthy, when the manager fired a gunshot. McLean was dead when he arrived at the hospital, while McCarthy was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to the stomach. The saloon manager, James J. Connor, was arrested on suspicion of murder.Former big league catcher Larry McLean, shot and killed. The Toronto World. March 25, 1921. Retrieved March 25, 2016.

He was educated at the grammar school and University of Edinburgh. Early in life he was an officer in the army. Having wasted his own fortune and that of his wife, a descendant of the Adair family, he became an officer in the revenue department at Edinburgh and was later appointed surgeon's mate of the Porcupine sloop of war, bound to the Leeward Islands. Shortly thereafter, he returned to England and soon decided to proceed to Antigua, where he became assistant to a relative, and began to study the medical profession. He also undertook the management of an estate on Antigua, becoming familiar with the condition of the slaves. Although he was anxious for the improvement of the conditions of the slaves, he was opposed to emancipation. He published a tract in 1789 on the subject of the abolition of slavery, in which he tried to depict the real state of slavery in the West Indies, the probable consequences of the abolition of the slave trade; to point out some grievances of the slave, the means by which they might be relieved, and, he added, the necessary regulations of the hospital for the management of the sick. He held that humanity to slaves and religious instruction were the only securities upon which the West India planter could safely rely. His own conduct towards slaves was very kind. He protected and nurtured them as his own children, and they were friendly in return. In a few years he left the West Indies, took a voyage to America, and made the acquaintance of Benjamin Franklin. After a tour in the United States, he returned to Edinburgh, took his degree of M.D., and then settled as a physician at Andover, in Hampshire. After the war with America had commenced, he returned to the West Indies on short notice, at the request of a friend. Upon his arrival he was appointed physician to Monk's Hill and to the commander-in-chief of the troops, and also as one of the assistant judges of the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas. At this time he adopted the name of Adair, having become the next male heir to the estate of his mother's family. In 1783 he left the West Indies, returned to England, and settled at Bath, where he became in volved in many disputes with his professional colleagues and others. These arose partly from his determined opposition to quacks and quackery‚Äîhis attempts to expose and suppress quackery may be seen as quixotic, but they were no less laudable. His temper was, however, altogether unfit for the warfare which he brought about. He was naturally querulous, hot, and irascible, and his disposition had been soured by disappointments in domestic life. He was, however, a man of an affectionate nature, and endowed with lively sensibility. He was generous to the poor, and the profits of the work he published were all given to support the Bath hospital. His professional acquirements were of no mean description, and he appears to have been a close and rational observer. He became hypochondriacal, and died at Harrogate in 1802. Works He published the following works. *Medical Cautions for the consideration of Invalids, Bath, 1786, 8vo. second edition, 1787. These specially relate to diet and regimen, and there is a table of the relative digestibility of foods; also essays on fashionable diseases; the dangerous effects of hot and crowded rooms; an inquiry into the use of medicine during a course of mineral waters; and on quacks, quack medicines, and lady doctors. *A Philosophical and Medical Sketch of the Natural History of the Human Body and Mind, Bath, 1787, 8vo. To this work is subjointed an Essay on the Difficulties of attaining Medical Knowledge. *Unanswerable Arguments against the Abolition of the Slave Trade, Bath, 1789, 8vo. *Essays on Fashionable Diseases, Bath, 1790, 8vo. *Essay on a Nondescript, or Newly-invented Disease, 1790, 8vo. He published some papers in the Medical Commentaries, especially one in vol. viii on smallpox in the West Indies, and in vol. xvii on the successful use of cuprum vitriolatum and conium, in two cases of tuberculosis; some strange memoirs relative to himself, etc., under the title of P. Paragraph and R. Goosequill; and also some remarks on Philip Thicknesse, under the same title; and two sermons addressed to sailors and slaves in the West Indies.

Early life Hamilton was born in Obion County, Tennessee in 1932. He was educated in the Obion County public schools. He attended Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis) and was graduated with the B.A. degree from Murray State University, where he participated in the ROTC program, in 1955. He immediately afterward fulfilled his commitment to the United States Army, spending two years on active duty as a second lieutenant before being honorably discharged in 1957, although he remained in the Tennessee Army National Guard until 1977. Early public service Hamilton's first elected office was service on the Union City, Tennessee Board of Education. In 1964, he was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, where his father had previously served, as a Democrat. Hamilton served two terms in the State House. State senator In 1968, Hamilton was elected to the state Senate from District 24, representing much of the northern part of West Tennessee. He served in an increasingly important series of positions on committees and in party leadership posts, culminating with his selection as majority leader in 1977, a position which he was to hold for 10 years. In 1987, a rebellion within the Democratic Caucus began over the largely conservative leadership and style of Senate Speaker and Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee John S. Wilder, a close Hamilton friend and ally, which resulted in the nomination by the Democrats in the 1987 organizational session of the legislature of Riley Darnell of Clarksville, Tennessee for Lieutenant Governor and Speaker. However, Hamilton led a faction of eight other Democratic senators who remained loyal to Wilder, and along with unanimous support from the Republican senators, this coalition voted to retain Wilder. The nine dissident Democrats were then dismissed from the Democratic caucus and reorganized as their own group, which they styled the \\"New Democratic Caucus\\", with Hamilton as their leader. Hamilton and his allies maintained some positions of leadership in the Senate, with others being filled by Republicans. Hamilton chaired the all-important Calendar Committee, and remained on other influential committees, most notably Ways and Means. While in the state senate Hamilton was very active in the National Conference of State Legislatures. He was also very active in the state's conservation efforts with regard to Reelfoot Lake, which was located in his district and served as an important source of tourism as well as an important aquatic and wildlife resource. In 1994 Republican Don Sundquist was elected governor of Tennessee and the Republican representation in the state senate increased to 15, just two short of a majority. Shortly after this, Hamilton and another Democratic senator who had also been a traditional Wilder ally made the decision to switch parties, giving the Republicans their first majority in the Tennessee Senate since Reconstruction, and Hamilton again became majority leader, although now of the other party. However, the Republican majority was short-lived as Hamilton did not choose to run for reelection in 1996, and the senate reverted to Democratic control. Commissioner In 1997, shortly after his state senate term ended, Sundquist named Hamilton to his Cabinet as Commissioner of Environment and Conservation. Hamilton seemed to relish this position, serving until the end of the Sundquist Administration in January 2003. Hamilton implemented a system of user fees at many state parks to help offset their operating expenses; this program was frozen upon the inauguration of Phil Bredesen as governor. Personal Hamilton was a Methodist. He was married to the former Dale White. The couple had three children, and five grandchildren. Both Hamiltons were members of several fraternal and service organizations, including the American Legion, the Masons, the Knights Templar, the Shriners, and the Obion County Chamber of Commerce. He also served on the board of trustees of the Southern College of Optometry. Dale Hamilton died in 2007. Milton Hamilton died on September 5, 2008, at Centennial Hospital in Nashville.

History A monastic cell existed here as early as 736 or thereabouts, referred to in the Aachen Monastery Register(\\"Klosterverzeichnis\\") in 817 as \\"Buria\\". After the Hungarian wars, reconstruction began in 977 with an endowment from Emperor Otto II. More times of crisis came upon the abbey with the fire of 1346, mismanagement of the prebendal income and the effects of the Reformation. Michaelbeuern Abbey From the 17th century however Michaelbeuern began a long period of prosperity, which led to ambitious building works, for example the Baroque high altar of 1691 in the abbey church, by Meinrad Guggenbichler and Johann Michael Rottmayr. At this time more than twenty-five monks of Michaelbeuern gained their doctorates at the Benedictine University of Salzburg. The community also took on many pastoral responsibilities in the surrounding parishes. During the National Socialist period the monks were expelled, but returned after World War II. The abbey church, re-romanised, was re-dedicated in 1950. From 1641 the abbey was a member of the Salzburg Congregation, which in 1930 was merged into the present Austrian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. The abbey today The abbey today is a thriving Benedictine community, well known as an educational and cultural centre. The abbey runs a school and owns different business like a farm, a district heating plant, a biogas plant and a participation in a brewery (Augustiner Br√§u Kloster M√ºlln).

When Red Ruffing's plaque was dedicated in 2004, his son called it \\"the second-greatest honor you can have in baseball, in my opinion\\" trailing only induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The history of the original Monument Park can be traced to the old Yankee Stadium in 1932, when the team posthumously dedicated an on-field monument to manager Miller Huggins in center field. Additional team members were honored with monuments and plaques in the area over the years. During the stadium's renovation in the mid-1970s, the center field fence was moved in , enclosing prior monuments, plaques, and a flag pole beyond the field of play. Over time, additional plaques were added to the area and \\"Monument Park\\" became formalized; in 1985, the park was opened for public access. When the Yankees moved to their new ballpark in 2009, a replica Monument Park was built beyond the center-field fences and the contents of the old one transported over. Thirty-seven members of the Yankee organization have been honored in Monument Park, while 22 have had their uniform numbers retired. Plaques in Monument Park are a great honor for players so distinguished. The monuments mounted posthumously on five large red granite blocks are the highest honor of all. Only six Yankees have been so recognized: manager Miller Huggins, players Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, and Joe DiMaggio, and owner George Steinbrenner. History Precursor The original Yankee Stadium was built in 1923. As with many other so-called Jewel Box ballparks of the era the flag pole was placed in play. With a generous center field dimension of to straightaway center field, there was plenty of room for it without materially interfering in play. In 1929, Yankees manager Miller Huggins died suddenly, and in his honor the team erected a free-standing monument in front of the flag pole consisting of a bronze plaque mounted on an upright block of red granite resembling a headstone. This, in turn, led many Yankee fans over the years, particularly children, to believe that the players honored were also buried there upon their death. The original placement of the monuments in deep center field at the pre-renovated Yankee Stadium. Left in the picture. The Huggins monument was later joined by similar memorials to Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth, which were erected upon their deaths. Over time, a number of plaques were mounted behind them on the outfield wall. Placing monuments in the field of play was not so unusual at the time, as there had been in-play stones and plaques at the Polo Grounds and Forbes Field. In 1969, Mickey Mantle was given a plaque by Joe DiMaggio to hang on the center field wall, who in turn gave Joe DiMaggio a plaque of his own which, in Mickey's words, had to be hung a little bit higher than his. From 1936 through 1973, the distance from home plate to the center field fence was . Despite the distance, a batted ball still sometimes made it back there. In the 1992 book The Gospel According to Casey, by Ira Berkow and Jim Kaplan, it is reported that on one occasion a Yankees outfielder had let the ball get by him and was fumbling for it among the monuments. Manager Casey Stengel hollered to the field, \\"Ruth, Gehrig, Huggins, somebody get that ball back to the infield!\\" Monument Park I The original Monument Park consisted of a row of monuments with plaques lining the wall behind them When Yankee Stadium was remodeled from 1974 to 1975, the center field fence was moved in to from its previous ; a subsequent reduction brought the fence in again to in 1985, but was reduced 2 feet in 1988. This enclosed the area, formerly in play, containing the flag pole and monuments. As this fenced-in area between the two bullpens gathered additional plaques on the original wall, it began to be referred to as \\"Monument Park\\". With the formalization of the area as an official Monument Park, the Mantle and DiMaggio plaques were removed from the wall upon their deaths and mounted on red granite blocks matching the original three of Huggins, Gehrig, and Ruth. Monument Park was inaccessible to fans until 1985. After the center field fence was moved in, the Yankees enabled fans to visit Monument Park prior to most games at Yankee Stadium. Monument Park was also part of the public tour of the venue. Monument Park II The second Monument Park When the Yankees moved to their new ballpark, the Yankees established a new Monument Park in the new stadium. An area was built behind the fence in straightaway center field, below the Center Field Sports Bar that serves as the batter's eye. Built of pearl blue granite from Finland, this new monument park features the five Yankee monuments in a central area around a black marble Yankees logo. This is flanked by two short stone walls which hold the retired numbers. The plaques are mounted on the back wall and the September 11 monument is on one end of the park. In contrast to the old stadium, the new Monument Park is not readily visible from the field, and its relatively drab appearance and inconspicuous placement have led some to derisively nickname it \\"Monument Cave\\". Spectators can visit Monument Park prior to the beginning of each game. It closes 45 minutes before first pitch. Honorees Honored baseball members The following players and other Yankees personnel are honored with monuments or plaques in Monument Park. Monuments are considered a greater honor than plaques, and are only awarded posthumously. Often, the uniform number of the player being honored is retired in the same ceremony. Such events historically often took place either at home openers or on Old-Timers' Day, but have lately been scheduled on separate weekend home games.

Ruppert's plaque was placed on the outfield wall, to the right of the flagpole. The Lou Gehrig monument was placed to the left of the Huggins monument. Gehrig was the first Major League Baseball player to have his uniform number retired. The Babe Ruth monument was placed to the right of the Huggins monument. The Ed Barrow plaque was placed on the wall, to the left of the flagpole. The plaque in the first Monument Park in honor of Jackie Robinson In honor of Jackie Robinson's unique place as the first black player of the modern era, his number 42 was retired throughout baseball on April 15, 1997, the 50th anniversary of his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Yankees erected a plaque for Robinson reading: \\"In becoming the first Major League player to break the color barrier, Jackie will forever be an inspiration with his grace, dignity and perseverance. His story and the stories of those who never had the same opportunity must never be forgotten.\\" 42s were also painted in front of each dugout. Players active at the time of the number's retirement in 1997 were granted a special exemption permitting them to continue wearing the number for the remainder of their careers; the last such active player to wear number 42 was Yankee relief pitcher Mariano Rivera. The Yankees honored Rivera by retiring his uniform number on September 22, 2013, during his final season, making him the first active player to be enshrined in Monument Park. Mantle wore his #7 when he coached the Yankees in 1970, even though it was retired the previous year, while Berra wore his #8 while he coached the Yankees from 1976 through 1985, though it was retired in 1972. Similarly, when Martin returned to manage the Yankees in 1988, he wore his #1, which had been retired in his honor in 1986. With Jeter's number being retired, no Yankee can wear a single-digit positive number. Other honorees In addition to baseball related recognitions, the Knights of Columbus donated plaques in honor of the Masses celebrated at Yankee Stadium by Pope Paul VI on October 4, 1965; Pope John Paul II on October 2, 1979; and Pope Benedict XVI on April 20, 2008. The Yankees also dedicated a monument to the victims and rescue workers of the September 11 attacks on September 11, 2002, the first anniversary of the attacks.

It is administered by an inhaler under the brand name Tilade, and as an eye drop under the brand name Alocril. The effects of nedocromil versus asthma are gradual rather than fast-acting and it is not indicated for acute respiratory distress compared to fast acting bronchodilators like albuterol or other well-known inhaler medications). Liquid preparations of nedocromil are available in the UK under the name Rapitil for use for allergic eye reactions. Nedocromil sodium has been shown to be effective in alleviating symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Nedocromil is classified as a benzopyrone. Nedocromil acts as a mast cell stabilizer, inhibits the degranulation of mast cells, prevents release of histamine and tryptase, so preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. US Production of inhaled nedocromil ceased in April 2008.

It has a PLA Navy designation H/PJ12. It is mounted in an enclosed automatic turret and directed by radar, and electro-optical tracking systems. The maximum rate of fire is 5800 rd/m, and the effective range is up to 3 km.  Development  The gun is designed by the 713th research institute under the name 'Project 850' and is powered by two electric motors. The radar TR47C is a derivative of the EFR-1/LR66 J-band radar (NATO code name: Rice Lamp) by Xi'an Research Institute of Navigation Technology, but it is unclear that if this derivative is developed by the same institution. The OFC (Optical Fire Control)-3/H/ZGJ-4 electro-optical fire control system is designed by the Central China Optronic (electro-optical) Research Institute.  Origin  The system's primary purpose is defense against anti-ship missiles, and other precision guided weapons. However, it can also be employed against fixed/rotary wing aircraft, ships and other small craft, coastal targets, and floating mines. Though externally similar to the Dutch Goalkeeper in appearance, it is thought to operate indigenous radar and optical systems. Another reported source of technology was reported to be the French which had experimented with the same General Electric EX-83 mount for their CIWS requirements. Two systems, SAGEM's SAMOS and the Thomson-CSF's SATAN were under evaluation in October 1987. The SAGEM SAMOS system featured the EX-83 mount with a SAGEM VOLCAN optical director, while the Thomson-CSF variant was controlled with an off-board Castor IIJ fire-control radar. Photos of the prototype Type 730 unit under trial apparently shows a SAGEM VOLCAN EO director in place of the domestic OFC-3/H/ZGJ-4 EO director.  Design   Radar  The TR47C radar operates in the same way of AN/APY-1/2 radar on board E-3 Sentry in that the azimuth is scanned mechanically, while the elevation is scanned electronically, incorporating a total of 169 transceivers of phased array technology that enables the radar to pick up the splashes of 30 mm rounds. Like the western CIWS, the information is processed on site, via local computers of the radar and the gun mount, thus providing faster reaction time than the Russian design in which the radar and fire control system are separately located. The system can track a sea-skimming target with 0.1 square metre radar cross section at 8 km, extended to 15 km if the radar cross section is increased to 2 square metres, and further extended to 20 km if the radar cross section is increased to 10 square metres, though the targets could not be engaged until much closer (3 km) due to the limited range of the gun.  Fire-control system  The OFC-3 system is modular design that comprises a laser range finder, a color TV camera, and an IR camera, and the laser range finder can be replaced by a laser designator (for a laser beam-riding SAM), the TV camera can be replaced by a night vision camera, and the IR camera can be replaced by an ImIR, at higher cost. Development to incorporate the dual band IR, night vision camera, and the color TV camera is reportedly in progress. Type 730 CIWS is an autonomous closed-loop system and thus offers faster reaction time than the Russian AK-630. Type 730 CIWS is fully compatible with Chinese and European combat data systems such as ZKJ-1, ZKJ-4, ZKJ-4A-3, ZKJ-5, ZKJ-6, ZKJ-7, H/ZBJ-1, and Thomson-CSF TAVITAC, and can be directly integrated with these combat data systems without any modification.  Armament  The 30 mm Gatling gun mount designated as H/PJ-12 is extremely similar to the General Electric GAU-8/A Avenger. Although there are sources claiming that it is the Chinese version of the Russian Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-30 Gatling gun, this appears to be unlikely, since the Russian Gatling gun only has six barrels. H/PJ-12 is versatile in that its FCS can be either separately installed at different locations like the Soviet AK-630, or directly integrated on the gun mount. Like the American GAU-8/A Avenger, it is recommended not to fire longer than a single minute at a rate of 4,200 rounds per minute, after which the generated heat would begin melting the rifling of the barrels, shortening its useful life. Rates of fire beyond 4,200 rounds per minute increase wear. There are one (Type 730)or two (Type 730B/C, LD-2000) ammunition drums each contains 640 (Type 730) or 500 (Type 730B/C, LD-2000) rounds, and other versions of the ammunition drums have been reportedly developed.  Variants   Type 730  Original variant.  Type 730C  Type 730C is a new variant unveiled in February 2017 that combines the existing Type 730 seven-barrelled 30 mm rotary cannon with 6x FL-3000N missiles. The system comes with LR66 tracking radar and OC8 electro-optical tracker, though not fitted on the CIWS probably due to weight and electromagnetic interference issues, to track two separate targets simultaneously (fire on one, keep track of the other); the whole system comes with the SR64A search radar. The gun carries two 500-round drums (total 1000 rounds) with firing modes of 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 rounds per minute.China's CSSC Unveiled the Type 730C Dual Gun and Missile CIWS. Navy Recognition. 9 March 2017 Gun effective range: *150 m minimum, 1400 m interception, 2500 m effective against missiles (using APDS) *150‚Äì3500 meters against aircraft (using HE) *5000 meters against surface targets (using HE) Missile engagement envelope: 2‚Äì8 km  LD-2000  LD-2000, the land-based version of Type 730 CIWS. The Chinese Navy is currently developing a new version of the system which will include missiles on the same installation. A land based variant designated LD-2000 (LD: Lu Dun, ÈôÜÁõæ, meaning Land Shield) have also been successfully developed, but this land version lacks the electro-optic fire control system of the ship-borne version, instead, the radar is supplemented by a thermal imaging sight. The weapon is loaded with 1,000 rounds, enough, apparently, for about 48 potential target engagements, same as its naval counterpart, with effective range of 2.5 to 3.5 km. However, the missile armed version was first successfully developed for the land based version as LD-2000 Gai, with six surface-to-air missiles, three on each side of the turret, as it was revealed to public in 2005, but it is not clear the exact type of the missile, some claim that they are TY-90, while others claim they are DK-9, the surface-to-air version of PL-9.  Type 1130  Further development of Type 730 resulted in the Type 1130, which first appeared on Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning. This successor of Type 730 is also 30 mm caliber and has a total 11 barrels, with reported rate of fire of 11,000 rounds per minute. Originally developed with 10 barrels, later productions included 11 barrels when completed. Although it is reported that FL-3000 missiles can be integrated to the gun like FCS, this has not occurred yet, and FL-3000 was installed separately on the first Chinese aircraft carrier in its own launchers. There are two ammunition drums each contains 640 rounds (total 1280 rounds). Designated either H/PJ-11, the weapon is considered China's third generation CIWS, after the first generation Russian AK-630 and second generation indigenous Type 730. Chinese TV reported that it is able to intercept incoming anti-ship missiles up to a speed of Mach 4 with a 96% success rate.Newly Built PLAN Type 052D Destroyers Getting Fitted with Larger H/PJ-11 CIWS.

The novel is set in 1st century BC Rome and focuses on rumours as misrepresentation.  Plot  The story begins with Julia starving to death under the rule of her stepbrother Tiberius; she decides to write her own story. She was born into a world where war with Ptolemaic Egypt is certain. She is a rebellious little girl who is willful, passionate but with a gentleness and compassion for the people of Rome. She has republican sentiments like her father, but seems to have a more liberal view on how Rome should be run. Dearly beloved by nearly everyone she meets except her stepmother, Livia. Julia is loyal to her father, but not afraid to criticize his decisions. Julia grows up among intrigue and ultimately becomes its victim. Under the influence of her mother Scribonia, the poets Horace and Ovid, she begins to enjoy her life. Her only true friend is her slave and later freedwoman, Phoebe. As a little girl, she is told by one of her cousins the truth about her father and Livia's marriage; neither of them sleep together. Livia finds virgins, pregnant senator's wives and various other women instead. This shocks Julia and she loses respect for her father. When she is thirteen, she is nearly seduced by Calpurnius Piso who falls passionately in love with her. However, he fails when Julia is married at fourteen to her cousin Marcellus, whom Julia has a slight crush on. However, Marcellus is cannot bring himself to consummate their marriage. Julia is humiliated time and time again by the other women her age who mock her because of her failure to have a baby and not being able to tell them she was in fact still a virgin. When he falls ill a few years later and dies, this hits Julia quite hard and she takes the blame for his death although it wasn't her fault. Following Marcellus' death, she is betrothed to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, a man more than twice her age. She confides Agrippa that Marcellus never consummated their marriage and makes him swear never to tell anyone. Though at first Julia dislikes the idea of marrying Agrippa, she quickly grows fond of him and eventually falls in love with him. She finally marries Agrippa and falls pregnant instantly. Nine months after their marriage she gives birth to her son Gaius and upon Agrippa's return she falls pregnant with her \\"little monster\\" daughter Vipsania Julia. Around the time that she falls pregnant with her third child, Augustus passes a law making adultery a public crime and also enforces a law saying that all couples should have at least three children in order to receive extra privileges, such as viewing public games. Julia and Agrippa are covered, as too are people like Scribonia (who as Julia, Cornelia and Cornelius) but others have not, including Julia's close friend, the poet Horace. On Augustus' renewing of Lex Iulia and rule against bachelorism, she tries to protest on behalf of many of her friends. Upon the birth of her son Lucius, Augustus attempts to adopt Gaius and Lucius as his own sons (so both he and Livia will fit into the new law) but Julia refuses, advising him to get his own extra two children. Julia soon afterwards gives birth to her daughter Agrippina. Julia becomes friends with a woman named Aemilia and her husband Lucius Vinicius after the meeting of matrons, where Julia was worshiped in the guise of Diana. She also spends time with her cousins Claudia Marcella Major (Agrippa's ex-wife) and Iullus Antonius, the son of Mark Antony. Julia also attempts to aid Tiberius, husband to Agrippa's eldest daughter Vipsania in his poor self-esteem by watching him at his cavalry practice. Around this time, Scribonia gathers some information about Augustus' love affairs that leak through Julia. To counter the rumours, Tiberius starts a rumour that Julia had 'conceived a passion' for him and, out of his jealousy Iullus spreads the rumours. It is only when Scribonia finds out about the rumours that she helps Julia counter then by advising her not to go near Tiberius anymore. She tells Agrippa about what Tiberius has been spreading and that it isn't true, and he believes her. Julia falls pregnant with her fifth child but Agrippa catches a fever and because of Julia's pregnancy, she cannot go to him. He dies from the fever. Julia is devastated. Through her grief, she begins to call the baby inside her by Agrippa's name and upon his birth she names him Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa Postumus for his father and she cherishes him above all of her children because he looks and behaves so much like his father. Following Agrippa's death, Augustus finally forces Julia to let him adopt Gaius and Lucius, but she refuses to let him have Postumus. Augustus also forces Julia into marriage with Tiberius, who is forced to divorce his wife in order to marry her. Augustus sends him away to fight in a campaign so they at least won‚Äôt have to see him. Not long after the marriage, Julia gets a visit from Octavia, who never fully recovered from Marcellus‚Äô death, who tells her the truth about Livia; she wanted the marriage between Julia and Tiberius because it led to the possibility that he might be the next emperor. Octavia dies soon afterwards. Iullus Antonius also becomes a close friend of Julia‚Äôs, and tells her that he had strongly opposed the marriage because he felt it threatened Gaius and Lucius‚Äô claims to the throne. He then reveals to Julia that he has fallen in love with her and his real motives for protesting for against her marriage to Tiberius were partly because he wanted her for himself and he had urged Augustus to let her marry him instead. He shares with her his desires to see Gaius on the throne after Augustus dies, as well as his desires to marry Julia. She realises that he had only become her friend with the intention of becoming her lover and sends him away, but Iullus makes a promise to her that if anything were to happen to Tiberius, she would let him marry her. After the meeting, Iullus pursues Julia sexually by sending her love letters, gifts and various other forms to show his affection. Though Julia desires him also, she resists the temptation from fear of falling pregnant while Tiberius is away. Tiberius returns from his campaign after two years, and though Julia tries to be kind to him, he treats her coldly because he has heard of Iullus‚Äô passions for her. Tiberius insults Julia constantly and hysterically blames her for his divorce from Vipsania. Julia realises that her husband is mentally unstable and only realises his cruelty when be brutally rapes her upon returning from his campaign. Julia is devastated by her situation and Tiberius cruelty‚Äôs drives her to giving into Iullus, beginning an affair with him. They disguise their relationship behind her pregnancy and are forced to meet each other in secret at friends‚Äô homes. Iullus aids Julia in promoting her sons to the people of Rome. They begin to favour the boys and Iullus over Tiberius. Julia gives birth to Tiberius‚Äô son but he dies only a few weeks after being born. After a while, Tiberius is no longer able to tolerate Julia taking Iullus‚Äô side over his and decides to retire from Rome. When Julia requests a divorce, Augustus refuses because it will cut him off from the Claudian family. Desperate to marry Julia and assure the boys place in the succession, Iullus comes up with a plan to murder Tiberius while he‚Äôs out of Rome because if Tiberius were to die, Augustus would have no one but Iullus to turn to and it would remove the Claudians from the picture forever. When Iullus goes to Julia with the plan, she refuses to help him and says she won‚Äôt support him. Not long after this, Julia is arrested with her friends for adultery. She is also charged with treason against the emperor, not for trying to murder Tiberius but Augustus. Though Julia denies everything, Augustus flies into a violent rage and demands she be exiled or executed to the senate. Iullus Antonius and the others are arrested, including Julia‚Äôs brother Cornelius and while her friends are exiled, Iullus is forced to write a confession before he is executed. He admits that he did commit adultery with Julia but that she knew nothing of his plans and took responsibility for everything, in an attempt to save her from execution. He consequently commits suicide to avoid execution and to avoid further questioning. Rumours begin to fly that Augustus has gone mad and that Julia had begun another civil war, taking the place of Cleopatra and Iullus the place of Mark Antony. When Phoebe is taken to prison and threatened with torture, she commits suicide in order to keep Julia and Iullus‚Äô affair to herself. Scribonia saves Julia from execution by visiting Augustus and threatening an uprising of the people if he makes such a move. He agrees to just exile her and allows Scribonia to go with her into exile. Julia finishes the story by telling of how she has been locked in her house and refused to eat. The novel's ending is bittersweet and satisfying.

Those in the Diocese of Salzburg were formed in 1641 into the Salzburg Congregation, consisting of: *Admont Abbey *Michaelbeuern Abbey *Ossiach Abbey *St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal *St. Peter's Abbey, Salzburg The diocese also then included two further monasteries, the locations of which are now in Bavaria in Germany: *St. Vitus' Abbey on the Rott *Seeon Abbey Salzburg was secularised and became part of Austria in 1816. Later history Several of these abbeys ceased to exist as a result of the dissolution of monasteries enforced by Emperor Joseph II in the 1780s. Some survived, however, and the 19th century brought a revival in the monastic movement.

The population in 2011 was 5,952,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 189.37 km¬≤. It is situated in the central part of the eastern district of Vila Real, and consigned to the Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto Douro region. The town of Mur√ßa, seat of the municipal government, is on average 40 kilometres from many of the major urban centres of the region. History The Porca de Mur√ßa: an ancient Celt divinity found in the region of Mur√ßa Although there are no clear references to the origin of this community, most suspect that it extends to Celtic period, primarily due to the Porca de Mur√ßa (), a celebrated monument to a wild boar (and presumably a Celtic divinity). The first references to the region of Mur√ßa appeared in the Inquiri√ß√µes (inquiries/inventory) of King Afonso II. Municipal autonomy became a reality in the 13th century, when King Sancho II issued a foral (charter) on 8 May 1224. This was later confirmed and elaborated by Afonso III on 10 January 1268. Similar charters were elaborated on 18 April 1304 and 9 May 1512, by Kings Denis and Manuel, respectively. During the Liberal Revolution (18th century) Mur√ßa five Counts were honoured by King John VI of Portugal. In the 20th century, an administrative commission () was created on 2 January 1908, by the Partido Regenerador Liberal (), to promote local politics, in order to realize the regions first elections. The Regenerator Party was successful in these early elections, resulting in the taking of office of Father Jo√£o M. Ribalonga, who would guide the administration of the municipality from 30 November 1908 until the 5 October 1910 Revolution. The first republican municipal commission was elected on 19 March 1911. During the Estado Novo regime (1933-1974) the first municipal regalia, including coat-of-arms, flag and seal, were established, in addition to the changing of many road names. After the Carnation Revolution (25 April 1974), there was a great upheaval in local government, that forced a democratic structure and implemented many dynamic changes to financial and political laws. Geography {border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\" } Mur√ßa can be identified in terms of three subregions in the Tr√°s-os-Montes: the Terra Quente (), the Terra Fria () and the Zona de Montanha (), with their own distinct natural, social and cultural characteristics. There are distinct contrasts in the villages and towns of Tr√°s-os-Montes, with hot summers and icy winters, in lands that are marked by granite mountain faces, schist walls and steep or shallow valleys. The green forests and granite rocks of the Serra da Garraia or Parque Florestal de Mascanho (Mascanho Forest Park) dominate the north portions of the municipality, as does the chestnut forest of Jou and Vilares. Between many of the mountains and plains are olive orchards, part of the Rota de Azeite (), and interspersed by wheat fields or almond trees in flower, or the vineyards of the Alto Douro. Administratively, the municipality is divided into 7 civil parishes (freguesias): * Candedo * Carva e Vilares * Fiolhoso * Jou * Mur√ßa * Noura e Palheiros * Valongo de Milhais References Category:Municipalities of Vila Real District ","title":"Mur√ßa"},{"id":"4504760","text":"Hugh Anderson is the name of: * Hugh Anderson (cowboy) (1851‚Äì1873 or 1914), gunfighter who participated in the infamous gunfight at Hide Park * Hugh Alan Anderson (1933‚Äì2015), former Canadian politician * Hugh Anderson (motorcyclist) (born 1936), former Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champion from New Zealand * Hugh J.

Founded in 1527, it is one of the oldest schools in Britain and the third oldest school in the West Midlands, the first two being Bablake School (founded in 1344) and Wolverhampton Grammar School (founded in 1512). The school had boarders until 1969 but is now a day school only. The school was founded in 1527 by the Bishop of Exeter John Vesey (formerly John Harman) who was a friend of Henry VIII and tutor of his elder daughter Queen Mary I, and it currently has approximately 1025 pupils. The current headteacher is Dominic Robson, who was appointed to the position in September 2012. In 2004 BVGS became a Language College and, in 2007, the school gained Training School status. Former Assistant Headteacher Steve Baugh served as Head of the Training School and Continuing Professional Development. The school is also houses a co- educational sixth form college. It is situated on the A5127, next to Birmingham Metropolitan College (former Sutton Coldfield College) and the Cross-City Line.  History  16th century The first foundation deed set up by Bishop John Vesey in 1527 provided an endowment from property income of ¬£7 a year and twenty-one people were appointed Trustees to manage the school and pay a fit and proper person to teach Grammar and Rhetoric. Many of the trustees were related to Vesey including his brother Hugh Harman and his brother-in-law William Gibbons, among others. William Gibbons was appointed as the first warden under the Charter of Incorporation, yet no schoolmaster was ever appointed by the trustees of the deed at this time. Because Vesey was not living in Sutton at the time, he did not oversee the trustees duties and obligations. There is no evidence the original trustees carried out their duties of the school. By 22 August 1540 a second deed was established by Vesey providing for the endowed properties to be held by the Warden and Society of Sutton. The deed states that the schoolmaster must be a layman. Between 1527 and 1540 many developments had occurred in relation to the English Reformation and this stipulation highlighted Vesey's intent to retain Catholic tradition at the time. John Savage was appointed as the first headmaster in 1540. Tuition was free, with traditional, academic subjects such as logic, rhetoric and grammar being taught to the local boys. Until 1544, St Mary's Hall was used as a schoolroom and then a school was built close to the church on Blind Lane, behind where the Masonic Buildings (the former Town Hall) are located. On 5 October 1546 John Savage died and Lawrence Nowell of Brasenose College, Oxford was appointed as his successor. The Corporation started court proceedings to remove him from office due to neglect of the school, presumably because Nowell prioritised his research work. The course decided that he could not be dismissed \\"except if any notable crime could be proved against him\\". Nowell won the case, but still agreed to resign the post in early 1548. The Corporation paid him a gratuity of ¬£10 of which Vesey contributed a third to encourage him to leave. Nowell was a supporter of the Reformation which increased the will to remove him from the position. When Vesey died in 1554, for eighty years after his death the trustees disregarded their obligations for personal gain. School land was leased to friends and family members at low rents which prevented schoolmasters from receiving enough income to maintain the school. 17th century In 1617 Robert Blakesley exhibited a bill against the Warden and Society of Sutton. A commission was established and found that lands with an annual value of ¬£67 had been taken by former wardens and as little as ¬£10 annually was given to the headmaster. The commission advised the Corporation that proceedings should be made to recover the school land but because Blakesley did not live in Sutton the Court settled against Blakesley. The Corporation did not take action to improve the school's finances. Complaints relating to the diligence of the Trustees and the Corporation came before the Chancery Court which ordered in 1636 that control be transferred to a new board of fourteen Trustees. 20th century In November 1981, 13-year-old John Haddon was abducted on his way to school from nearby Sutton Park and subsequently murdered. His body was found near Fenny Drayton. Two males, Paul Corrigan aged 30 and 15-year-old Derek McInnes, were charged with his murder in December 1981. In the 1990s, the rugby pitch at the Tamworth Road end of the playing fields was sold for residential development, to fund various projects such as the \\"Randon Design Centre\\". The Randon Design Centre was constructed in 1990 at a cost of ¬£1.5 million. The block houses the art and design and technology departments and was designed by Birmingham-based Associated Architects. The library, which was located on the site of the Randon Design Centre, was moved into an extension constructed on the main school building. Sports In April 2008, Isaac of Bath Rugby and the Samoa national rugby union team announced he was to retire and take up the head of rugby position at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School.

In the terminology of signal processing, a frame provides a redundant, stable way of representing a signal. Frames are used in error detection and correction and the design and analysis of filter banks and more generally in applied mathematics, computer science, and engineering.  Definition and motivation   Motivating example: computing a basis from a linearly dependent set  Suppose we have a set of vectors \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\\\\\} in the vector space V and we want to express an arbitrary element \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in V as a linear combination of the vectors \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_{k}\\\\\\\\}, that is, we want to find coefficients c_k such that : \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\sum_k c_k \\\\mathbf{e}_k If the set \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\\\\\} does not span V, then such coefficients do not exist for every such \\\\mathbf{v}. If \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\\\\\} spans V and also is linearly independent, this set forms a basis of V, and the coefficients c_{k} are uniquely determined by \\\\mathbf{v}. If, however, \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_{k}\\\\\\\\} spans V but is not linearly independent, the question of how to determine the coefficients becomes less apparent, in particular if V is of infinite dimension. Given that \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\\\\\} spans V and is linearly dependent, one strategy is to remove vectors from the set until it becomes linearly independent and forms a basis. There are some problems with this plan: # Removing arbitrary vectors from the set may cause it to be unable to span V before it becomes linearly independent. # Even if it is possible to devise a specific way to remove vectors from the set until it becomes a basis, this approach may become unfeasible in practice if the set is large or infinite. # In some applications, it may be an advantage to use more vectors than necessary to represent \\\\mathbf{v}. This means that we want to find the coefficients c_k without removing elements in \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\\\\\}. The coefficients c_k will no longer be uniquely determined by \\\\mathbf{v}. Therefore, the vector \\\\mathbf{v} can be represented as a linear combination of \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_{k}\\\\\\\\} in more than one way.  Formal definition  Let V be an inner product space and \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\\\\\}_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} be a set of vectors in V. These vectors satisfy the frame condition if there are positive real numbers A and B such that 0 and for each \\\\mathbf{v} in V, : A \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right\\\\^2 \\\\leq \\\\sum_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\mathbf{e}_k \\\\rangle \\\\right^2 \\\\leq B \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right\\\\^2 . A set of vectors that satisfies the frame condition is a frame for the vector space. The numbers A and B are called the lower and upper frame bounds, respectively. The frame bounds are not unique because numbers less than A and greater than B are also valid frame bounds. The optimal lower bound is the supremum of all lower bounds and the optimal upper bound is the infimum of all upper bounds. A frame is called overcomplete (or redundant) if it is not a basis for the vector space.  Analysis operator  The operator mapping \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in V to a sequence of coefficients c_k is called the analysis operator of the frame. It is defined by: : \\\\mathbf{T}: V \\\\mapsto \\\\ell^2, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mapsto \\\\\\\\{c_k\\\\\\\\}_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}}, \\\\quad c_k = \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v},\\\\mathbf{e_k}\\\\rangle By using this definition we may rewrite the frame condition as : A \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right\\\\^2 \\\\leq \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{T} \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right\\\\^2 \\\\leq B \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right\\\\^2 where the left and right norms denote the norm in V and the middle norm is the \\\\ell ^2 norm.  Synthesis operator  The adjoint operator \\\\mathbf{T}^* of the analysis operator is called the synthesis operator of the frame. : \\\\mathbf{T}^*: \\\\ell^2 \\\\mapsto V, \\\\quad \\\\\\\\{c_k\\\\\\\\}_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} \\\\mapsto \\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\sum_k c_k\\\\mathbf{e}_k  Motivation for the lower frame bound  We want that any vector v \\\\in V can be reconstructed from the coefficients \\\\\\\\{ \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v},\\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\}_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} . This is satisfied if there exists a constant A > 0 such that for all x,y \\\\in V we have: : A \\\\x-y \\\\|^2 \\\\le \\\\Tx-Ty \\\\|^2 By setting v=x-y and applying the linearity of the analysis operator we get that this condition is equivalent to: : A \\\\v \\\\|^2 \\\\le \\\\Tv \\\\|^2 for all v \\\\in V which is exactly the lower frame bound condition.  History  Because of the various mathematical components surrounding frames, frame theory has roots in harmonic and functional analysis, operator theory, linear algebra, and matrix theory. The Fourier transform has been used for over a century as a way of decomposing and expanding signals. However, the Fourier transform masks key information regarding the moment of emission and the duration of a signal. In 1946, Dennis Gabor was able to solve this using a technique that simultaneously reduced noise, provided resiliency, and created quantization while encapsulating important signal characteristics. This discovery marked the first concerted effort towards frame theory. The frame condition was first described by Richard Duffin and Albert Charles Schaeffer in a 1952 article on nonharmonic Fourier series as a way of computing the coefficients in a linear combination of the vectors of a linearly dependent spanning set (in their terminology, a \\"Hilbert space frame\\"). In the 1980s, St√©phane Mallat, Ingrid Daubechies, and Yves Meyer used frames to analyze wavelets. Today frames are associated with wavelets, signal and image processing, and data compression.  Relation to bases  A frame satisfies a generalization of Parseval's identity, namely the frame condition, while still maintaining norm equivalence between a signal and its sequence of coefficients. If the set \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\\\\\} is a frame of V, it spans V. Otherwise there would exist at least one non-zero \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in V which would be orthogonal to all \\\\mathbf{e}_k. If we insert \\\\mathbf{v} into the frame condition, we obtain : A \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right\\\\^2 \\\\leq 0 \\\\leq B \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right\\\\^{2} ; therefore A \\\\leq 0, which is a violation of the initial assumptions on the lower frame bound. If a set of vectors spans V, this is not a sufficient condition for calling the set a frame. As an example, consider V = \\\\mathbb{R}^2 with the dot product, and the infinite set \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\\\\\} given by :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (1,0) , \\\\, (0,1), \\\\, \\\\left(0,\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\right) , \\\\, \\\\left(0,\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\right), \\\\dotsc \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. This set spans V but since \\\\sum_k \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{e}_k , (0,1)\\\\rangle \\\\right^2 = 0 + 1 + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\\\tfrac{1}{3} +\\\\dotsb = \\\\infty, we cannot choose a finite upper frame bound B. Consequently, the set \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\\\\\} is not a frame.  Applications  In signal processing, each vector is interpreted as a signal. In this interpretation, a vector expressed as a linear combination of the frame vectors is a redundant signal. Using a frame, it is possible to create a simpler, more sparse representation of a signal as compared with a family of elementary signals (that is, representing a signal strictly with a set of linearly independent vectors may not always be the most compact form). Frames, therefore, provide robustness. Because they provide a way of producing the same vector within a space, signals can be encoded in various ways. This facilitates fault tolerance and resilience to a loss of signal. Finally, redundancy can be used to mitigate noise, which is relevant to the restoration, enhancement, and reconstruction of signals. In signal processing, it is common to assume the vector space is a Hilbert space.  Special cases   Tight frames  A frame is a tight frame if A = B; in other words, the frame satisfies a generalized version of Parseval's identity. For example, the union of k disjoint orthonormal bases of a vector space is a tight frame with A = B = k. A tight frame is a Parseval frame (sometimes called a normalized frame) if A = B = 1. Each orthonormal basis is a Parseval frame, but the converse is not always true. A frame \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\\\\\}_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} for V is tight with frame bound A if and only if : \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\sum_k \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v},\\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\rangle \\\\mathbf{e}_k for all \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in V.  Equal norm frame  A frame is an equal norm frame (sometimes called a uniform frame or a normalized frame) if there is a constant c such that \\\\|e_i\\\\= c for each i. An equal norm frame is a unit norm frame if c = 1. A Parseval (or tight) unit norm frame is an orthonormal basis; such a frame satisfies Parseval's identity.  Equiangular frames  A frame is an equiangular frame if there is a constant c such that \\\\langle e_i, e_j \\\\rangle = c for each distinct i and j.  Exact frames  A frame is an exact frame if no proper subset of the frame spans the inner product space. Each basis for an inner product space is an exact frame for the space (so a basis is a special case of a frame).  Generalizations  A Bessel Sequence is a set of vectors that satisfies only the upper bound of the frame condition.  Continuous Frame  Suppose H is a Hilbert space, X a locally compact space , and \\\\mu is a locally finite Borel measure on X. Then a set of vectors in H, \\\\\\\\{f_x\\\\\\\\}_{x\\\\in X} with a measure \\\\mu is said to be a Continuous Frame if there exists constants, 0 such that A||f||^2\\\\leq \\\\int_{X}|\\\\langle f,f_x\\\\rangle|^2d\\\\mu(x)\\\\leq B||f||^2 for all f\\\\in H. Example Given a discrete set \\\\Lambda\\\\subset X and a measure \\\\mu= \\\\delta_\\\\Lambda where \\\\delta_\\\\Lambda is the Dirac measure then the continuous frame property: A||f||^2\\\\leq \\\\int_{X}|\\\\langle f,f_x\\\\rangle|^2d\\\\mu(x)\\\\leq B||f||^2 reduces to: A||f||^2\\\\leq \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda\\\\in \\\\Lambda}|\\\\langle f,f_{\\\\lambda}\\\\rangle|^2\\\\leq B||f||^2 and we see that Continuous Frames are indeed the natural generalization of the frames mentioned above. Just like in the discrete case we can define the Analysis, Synthesis, and Frame operators when dealing with continuous frames. Continuous Analysis Operator Given a continuous frame \\\\\\\\{f_x\\\\\\\\}_{x\\\\in X} the Continuous Analysis Operator is the operator mapping \\\\\\\\{f_x\\\\\\\\}_{x\\\\in X} to a sequence of coefficients \\\\langle f,f_x\\\\rangle _{x\\\\in X}. It is defined as follows: T:H \\\\mapsto L^2(X,\\\\mu) by f \\\\to \\\\langle f,f_x\\\\rangle _{x\\\\in X} Continuous Synthesis Operator The adjoint operator of the Continuous Analysis Operator is the Continuous Synthesis Operator which is the map: T^*:L^2(X,\\\\mu) \\\\mapsto H by a_x \\\\to\\\\int_X a_x f_x d\\\\mu(x) Continuous Frame Operator The Composition of the Continuous Analysis Operator and the Continuous Synthesis Operator is known as the Continuous Frame Operator. For a continuous frame \\\\\\\\{f_x\\\\\\\\}_{x\\\\in X}, the Continuous Frame Operator is defined as follows: S:H\\\\mapsto H by Sf:=\\\\int_X \\\\langle f,f_x\\\\rangle f_x d\\\\mu(x) Continuous Dual Frame Given a continuous frame \\\\\\\\{f_x\\\\\\\\}_{x\\\\in X}, and another continuous frame \\\\\\\\{g_x\\\\\\\\}_{x\\\\in X}, then \\\\\\\\{g_x\\\\\\\\}_{x\\\\in X} is said to be a Continuous Dual Frame of \\\\\\\\{f_x\\\\\\\\} if it satisfies the following condition for all f, h\\\\in H: \\\\langle f, h\\\\rangle =\\\\int_X\\\\langle f,f_x\\\\rangle \\\\langle g_x, h\\\\rangle d\\\\mu(x)  Dual frames  The frame condition entails the existence of a set of dual frame vectors \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{e}}_{k} \\\\\\\\} with the property that : \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\sum_k \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{e}}_k \\\\rangle \\\\mathbf{e}_k = \\\\sum_k \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{e}_k \\\\rangle \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{e}}_k for any \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in V. This implies that a frame together with its dual frame has the same property as a basis and its dual basis in terms of reconstructing a vector from scalar products. In order to construct a dual frame, we first need the linear mapping \\\\mathbf{S} : V \\\\rightarrow V, called the frame operator, defined as : \\\\mathbf{S} \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\rangle \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} = \\\\mathbf{T}^*\\\\mathbf{T}\\\\mathbf{v}. From this definition of \\\\mathbf{S} and linearity in the first argument of the inner product, : \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{S} \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_k \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{e}_k \\\\rangle \\\\right^2 , which, when substituted in the frame condition inequality, yields : A \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right\\\\^2 \\\\leq \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{S} \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\rangle \\\\leq B \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right\\\\^2 , for each \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in V. The frame operator \\\\mathbf{S} is self-adjoint, positive definite, and has positive upper and lower bounds. The inverse \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1} of \\\\mathbf{S} exists and it, too, is self-adjoint, positive definite, and has positive upper and lower bounds. The dual frame is defined by mapping each element of the frame with \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1}: : \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{e}}_{k} = \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} To see that this makes sense, let \\\\mathbf{v} be an element of V and let : \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\rangle \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{e}}_{k} . Thus : \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\rangle ( \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} ) = \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1} \\\\left ( \\\\sum_{k} \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\rangle \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\right ) = \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{S} \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\mathbf{v} , which proves that : \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\rangle \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{e}}_{k} . Alternatively, we can let : \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{e}}_{k} \\\\rangle \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} . By inserting the above definition of \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{e}}_{k} and applying the properties of \\\\mathbf{S} and its inverse, : \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\rangle \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\rangle \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} = \\\\mathbf{S} (\\\\mathbf{S}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\mathbf{v} which shows that : \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{e}}_{k} \\\\rangle \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} . The numbers \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{e}}_{k} \\\\rangle are called frame coefficients. This derivation of a dual frame is a summary of Section 3 in the article by Duffin and Schaeffer. They use the term conjugate frame for what here is called a dual frame. The dual frame \\\\\\\\{\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{e}}_{k}\\\\\\\\} is called the canonical dual of \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_{k}\\\\\\\\} because it acts similarly as a dual basis to a basis. When the frame \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_{k}\\\\\\\\} is overcomplete, a vector \\\\mathbf{v} can be written as a linear combination of \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_{k}\\\\\\\\} in more than one way. That is, there are different choices of coefficients \\\\\\\\{c_{k}\\\\\\\\} such that \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\sum_{k} c_{k} \\\\mathbf{e}_{k}. This allows us some freedom for the choice of coefficients \\\\\\\\{c_{k}\\\\\\\\} other than \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{e}}_{k} \\\\rangle. It is necessary that the frame \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_{k}\\\\\\\\} is overcomplete for other such coefficients \\\\\\\\{c_{k}\\\\\\\\} to exist. If so, then there exist frames \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{g}_{k}\\\\\\\\} eq \\\\\\\\{\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{e}}_{k}\\\\\\\\} for which : \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{g}_{k} \\\\rangle \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} for all \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in V. We call \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{g}_{k}\\\\\\\\} a dual frame of \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_{k}\\\\\\\\}. Canonical duality is a reciprocity relation, i.e. if the frame \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{e}}_{k} \\\\\\\\} is the canonical dual frame of \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\\\\\}, then \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\\\\\\\} is the canonical dual frame of \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{e}}_{k} \\\\\\\\}.

Background Anthony Joseph Sansone was born September 19, 1905 in New York City. His parents were both Sicilian immigrants: Ignazio (Charles) Sansone and Paolina (Pauline) Giardina. Sansone married Sophie Frank (\\"Rita\\") in 1926, and had two children, Pauline and Anthony Joseph, Jr (\\"Nino\\"). Early Interest in physique development At an early age, Sansone (pronounced sahn-sown-eh, later Americanized to san-sown- ee) had contracted scarlet fever and then typhoid fever, leaving him with a fragile build. At 14, he took an interest in sports and began working out at a nearby park, doing running, chin-ups, handstands, and other acrobatics. At 16, he came across magazine pictures of physique star Tommy Farber in Physical Culture magazine and became interested in physical development. He trained under the tutelage of bodybuilding publisher Bernarr Macfadden and bodybuilder Charles Atlas (aka Angelo Siciliano). In October 1923, Sansone, 18, won a physique contest sponsored by Atlas. He did not pursue competitive bodybuilding as a career, however, and has never earned any titles like Mr America. Modeling Much of Tony Sansone's enduring fame in bodybuilding history was the result of his success as a model. Sansone began modeling when he was still a teenager. During the Depression, Sansone profited by selling pictures of himself through mail-order ads. He became a much sought-after model who posed for paintings, photographs, and sculpture. He was featured on many magazine covers, both American and European. He modeled for statues by James Earle Fraser (\\"Meriwether Lewis;\\" Fraser also designed the US buffalo nickel), Arthur Lee (\\"Rhythm\\" which was created over five years, 1925‚Äì1930), and Malvina Hoffman (\\"Nordic Type\\" and \\"Elemental Man\\"). Sansone published several photo books, including Modern Classics, Rhythm, Du-ets (sic), and Nudleafs. By 1936, he had sold over 15,000 copies of Modern Classics and Rhythm combined. Theater, film, businessman In the mid-1920s, Sansone began studying dance as an exercise. He was selected by Alexandre Gavrilov to perform in \\"Ballet Moderne\\" which debuted on April 10, 1928. He also toured with Polish-Yugoslavian ballet dancer Desha Podgorska. His dance career was cut short by a knee accident, but the training influenced his style of posing. From 1928 to 1929, Sansone performed in David Belasco's elaborate sci-fi theater production of \\"Mima.\\" The show ran for 180 performances before being closed down due to money problems. Among the spectators of \\"Mima\\" was photographer Edwin F. Townsend. Townsend took a great interest in Sansone and began photographing him in 1929. He went on to become Sansone's principal photographer. In 1929, Sansone got a small part in director John W. Harkrider's Glorifying the American Girl which co-starred Eddie Cantor. But like competitive bodybuilding, Sansone never pursued acting as a career. Sansone owned and operated three gyms (which he referred to as \\"body culture studios\\") in New York City. (Bodybuilder Steve Reeves was among his customers.) Physique Tony Sansone stood 6 feet tall and weighed 185 lbs. His muscles were highly defined but did not display the massive bulkiness common in modern bodybuilding. Sansone, in fact, took no interest in measurements, preferring a look that was more slender and flexible. His training included weightlifting, running, swimming, and gymnastics. Sansone was especially strong in parallel bar work. Sansone was photographed mainly in the nude, and was celebrated for his creative posing. Although naturally tan, Sansone enhanced his \\"bronze\\" look with body makeup. Charles Atlas called him \\"The Most Beautiful Man in America.\\" Physical-culture historian David Gentle has said, \\"If Sansone had been born in Greek antiquity, he would have been immortalized as a god.\\" Later life Tony Sansone retired from the gym business after thirty years. He went on to do volunteer work, especially teaching underprivileged children. Sansone died January 13, 1987 after a five- year struggle with colon cancer.

It is one of the five related Yoruba towns named \\"Oba\\", the others being *Oba-Ile, Olorunda LGA, Osun State, located about 15 km northwest of Osogbo, *Oba-Oke, Olorunda LGA, Osun State, located north-northwest of Osogbo, *Oba-Ile Akure South LGA, Ondo State, located just east of Akure, on Akure-Owo Road, *Oba-Akoko Akoko South-West LGA, Ondo State, located northeast of Owo. The original ·ªåÃÄb√† was the capital of an ancient ·ªåÃÄb√† civilization, a kingdom reputed in the oral history of the region as a center of great wealth and enterprise. Most of the extant Oba towns claim to be the original Oba or claim to be the oldest derivative of the ancient civilization. History and archaeology  Recent archaeological research results and published works of oral history experts, anthropologists and archeologists of the Arizona State University, USA and the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, of the region's contemporary and later settlements suggest that ·ªåÃÄb√† was founded between the 9th and 10th centuries. Regular conflicts with the neighbouring Nupe resulted in cycles of abandonment and reoccupation of the √íb√† mother city. British colonial records of Oba-Igbomina, indicate that the ancient ·ªåÃÄb√† kingdom used the \\"iron crown and rod\\" as the insignia of the king, perhaps as a result of their early involvement with iron-smelting and iron-working technology. Oratures makes references to id·∫π which is brass, not irin, which is iron. Therefore, the \\"iron\\" crown and rod are more likely to be made from some alloy such as brass or bronze. Subsequent Yoruba kingdoms (perhaps including Oba), used beaded \\"crown and rod\\" insignia, possibly because precious stones and glassware replaced metalware as the symbol of high rank and wealth. The great Oba diasporas The ancient ·ªåÃÄb√† kingdom produced a series of diasporas which influenced several other Igbomina and non-Igbomina Yoruba kingdoms and towns. The earliest diaspora from the ancient Oba civilization is constituted by the five towns in Yorubaland with the name \\"Oba\\" (not to be confused with the differently pronounced Oba, a river in Yorubaland): two in Osun State, Oba-Ile near Ikirun, Oba-Oke near Ikirun adjoining Oba-Ile; one in Kwara State Oba-Igbomina - generally called Oba without the Igbomina or the historically recent Isin tag; and two in Ondo State, Oba-Ile near Akure, and Oba-Akoko. Although none of these is the original Oba, but that they are diaspora settlements of Oba people from the more ancient Oba. Several of the clans that migrated away from the ancient √íb√† kingdom retained oratures which refer to their ancestry from the ancient ·ªåÃÄb√†. One such ·ªåÃÄb√†-diaspora clan is that of the royal Oba'lumo lineage whose ancestor Oba'lumo founded a new city-state called Isedo. This is a separate diaspora of smaller segments from Oba although this was the only known kingdom established by Oba √©migr√©s. A third diaspora sequence occurred in the 18th century resulting from attacks from the Nupe kingdom to the north of Oba Igbomina. Examples of Igbomina and non- Igbomina towns (in Kwara and Osun states of Nigeria) with large concentrations of people from ·ªåÃÄb√† diasporas include the following: Oke-Ila Orangun (Isedo- Oke), Ila Orangun (Isedo), Ora-Igbomina, Ipoti-Ekiti, Isanlu-Isin, Oke- Onigbin, Omu-Aran, Rore, Oyan, Inisha, Ipee, Oke-Ode, Babanla, Ajase-Ipo, Omupo, Esie, Oro, Ijomu-Oro, Iddo-Oro, Ahun, Idofin, Ado-Eku, Oreke, Sanmora and Pamo. Ago Oba (Camp of the Oba), the Oba diaspora community in the Owu section of Abeokuta in southwestern Nigeria is also a separate diaspora but further research of the oral history is necessary to clarify if this was a migration with Owu people as a result of the 19th century Yoruba wars, or whether Ago Oba migrated separately from another Oba location. Tourism to the Oba diasporas The legends of origin and of emigrations of the Oba diasporas has been a major effort of His Royal Highness, Dr. Ol√∫f·∫πÃÅmi ·ªål√°d√†p·ªçÃÄ Babal·ªçl√°. He has also been active since 2004 in promoting tourism (heritage tourism/cultural tourism and geo-tourism), and planning tourist expeditions to the various heritage sites and physiographic features and cultural performances/traditional occupations of the Igbomina-Yoruba and adjoining Yoruba areas. He has led various special tours to the various old sites, ruins and existing towns and historical places of Yorubaland, especially of the Igbomina-Yoruba region, verifying oral history and oral poetry of various clans and ancient kingdoms.

His diocese covered the entire state of Texas. Bishop Gregg presided through the difficult days of the Civil War and Reconstruction, and gave leadership as Texas changed from frontier to settled community. He saw the number of churches in his diocese grow from six to sixty. In 1874, toward the end of his episcopate, Gregg presided over the division of the Diocese of Texas into three dioceses - two new missionary districts of West Texas and North Texas. The Diocese of Texas retained the name of the original diocese in our present boundaries. In 1867, Bishop Gregg published the history of his native area with a decided emphasis on the Patriot role in the American Revolution. Bishop Gregg died at his Austin, Texas, home on July 10, 1893, is buried at Saint David's Church in Cheraw, South Carolina.

GT is a division of a Canadian conglomerate, Dorel Industries, which also markets Cannondale, Schwinn, Mongoose (company), IronHorse, DYNO, and RoadMaster bicycle brands; all manufactured in Asia. GT was founded in 1979, by Gary Turner and Richard Long in Santa Ana, California, and was noted at its inception for spearheading the prominence of BMX bicycles, later for developing a range of bikes around its \\"triple triangle\\" design, and at the end of its independent history, winning a commission to manufacture a $30,000 carbon fiber \\"Superbike\\" for the 1996 Summer games. GT sponsored numerous race teams and individuals, including noted riders Rebecca Twigg and Juli Furtado. In 1998, the company went public and subsequently merged with Questor Partners, then owner of Schwinn. The conglomerate went bankrupt in 2001 and was acquired by Pacific Cycle, which was in turn acquired by Dorel Industries in 2004. GT is noted for innovative BMX designs and their \\"triple triangle\\" hard-tail mountain bike frame design -- where seat stays are parallel to the downtube and attached to the top tube forward of the seat tube, rather than directly at the seat tube. The company often uses a frame design where the bike's top tube extends rearward past the seat tube, claimed to reduce the vibration transferred to the seat from the rear wheel. Later versions would have \\"GT\\" stamped on the end of the extended top tube. Company History Origins 1972-1979 GT bicycles began in 1972 when professional drag racer and experienced welder Gary Turner makes a frame for his son Craig Turner in his Fullerton, California garage to race at the BMX track. Most frames used during this period were modified Schwinn Stingrays which were heavy and broke easily under the stress of BMX racing and jumping. Gary Turner made his frames from 4130 chrome-moly tubing, the same tubing used in building chassis for dragsters which is stronger and lighter than regular carbon steel. Craig's bike gets noticed at the BMX track and Gary starts making frames for other kids. 1976 Pedals Ready GT magazine ad1977 Gary Turner BMX In 1976 Gary Turner begins producing frames for Pedals Ready, a Pro Shop at the Western Sports-A-Rama BMX track in Orange County, California named and marketed as Pedals Ready/GT. These are the first commercially distributed Gary Turner produced frames and one of the first sponsored riders to use them was Greg A. Hill who's father owned the Pedals Ready bike shop. Aware of the popularity of Gary Turner‚Äôs BMX frames, Richard Long contacts Turner in 1977 about supplying his Anaheim, California bicycle shop. Turner agrees and the foundation of GT Bicycles is born. These early frames were not yet the GT brand, but were simply called \\"Gary Turner\\" as seen by the frame stickers. Things happened fast and soon Richard and Gary invested in a manufacturing warehouse dedicated to making top quality Cro-moly BMX frames in Santa Ana, California. In 1979 they incorporated into GT Bicycles, Inc. GT standing for the initials of its founder, Gary Turner. Richard sold his bike shop and began selling frames as fast as possible to bicycle distributors across the USA and into Europe. Richard headed the business and marketing aspects of the company while Gary was the engineer and production head. GT Bicycles Inc. 1980 GT magazine ad In 1980 GT Bicycles Inc. releases their first bike the ‚ÄúGT Pro‚Äù and begins to sponsor BMX racers such as Lee Medlin and Denny Davidow. GT‚Äôs first magazine ad appears in Bicycle Motocross Action (BMX Action) in the January 1980 issue. For the 1981 season GT releases five models: Junior, Expert, 24, 26 and Pro. The models stay this way until 1984 when they introduce their first freestyle bike the Performer. In 1983 GT signs freestyle BMX riders Bob Morales and Eddie Fiola to design and eventually ride a new freestyle bike the Performer. At the time, the Performer was the only other dedicated freestyle bike besides the Haro Freestyler. The unique bent down tube was instantly recognizable and a design and marketing game changer which became a trademark look for GT. Bob Morales eventually left GT to focus on his own company DYNO Designs while Eddie Fiola became arguably the most famous and popular BMX personality of the 1980s until his contract was not renewed in 1987. In 1985 GT bought BMX accessories and apparel company Dyno. Bob Morales said \\"GT Bicycles made an offer to buy Dyno. I accepted their offer because Dyno was severely under-capitalized and in need of investment. I negotiated a contract with GT to design bicycle frames and components and to consult on a marketing strategy for them.\\" Morales developed a line of Dyno frames and bicycles for GT. Dyno also produced a line of clothing apparel and shoes under the Dyno brand. 1985 also saw GT produce their first Mountain bike for the emerging sport and market. Robinson Racing was acquired by GT Bicycles in 1987 from founder Chuck Robinson due to financial troubles with the company. Chuck went to work for GT and did promotion for them as well as heading up the South America sales because he spoke Spanish as well as other languages. Robinson Racing was found in the late 1970s after Chuck worked for DG BMX and Webco Bikes Inc. In 1989 GT Bicycles acquires Auburn Cycles another company that Bob Morales started along with Todd Huffman only one year earlier. Originally Auburn was going to be Honda Cycles but the Honda Motor corp. pulled out at the last minute declining to license the name. Bob and Todd continued with the project and Huffman came up with the Auburn name and Bob designed the original logo. When Auburn merged into GT Huffman was hired by GT to manage the brand in addition to his Marketing Director title. GT produced Auburn frames and bicycles until 1997. Also in 1989 GT acquired Powerlite. Powerlite was founded in 1977 by Steve Rink in Orange County, California as a frame for Peddlepower bike shop called the Peddlepower SR. In early 1979 this would change and the decals would read Powerlite. The company name was resurrected as an independent in 2002 as Powerlite Bicycles USA which produces BMX racing bikes and accessories. Ownership Change & Public Offering With lost public interest in the sport of BMX and declining sales, Long and Turner sold a controlling interest to Boston-based investment firm Bain Capital in 1993, which then took the company public in October 1995. 1996 GT SuperbikeIn 1996, GT won the commission to manufacture a highly aerodynamic bike design that would later become known as the \\"Superbike.\\" and later banned by Olympic regulations. A byproduct of a year-long development program with the U.S. national team known as Project '96, the bike featured a carbon graphite frame with no top tube, extremely thin seat and downtubes, a seat tube with a deep cutout to accommodate the rear wheel, as well as differently sized aerodynamic wheels. Describing the bike, the U. S. Cycling Federation's track endurance coach Craig Griffin said \\"it's so thin and light, and it's as strong as anything built. It's so aerodynamic that when you look at it from the front, it disappears.\\" Controversially, just prior to the 96 Summer Olympics, Rebecca Twigg quit the team, citing her Superbike's ill fit as one of the reasons for departing. On October 11, 1996, GT announced that it had reached an agreement with Nike whereby Nike will be an official sponsor for all of GT's bicycle racing teams in 1997. Under the new agreement, all GT team athletes will use Nike shoes and after-race apparel. This new sponsorship agreement represented an expansion of Nike's current sponsorship as the official shoe of the GT mountain bike team by the then CEO Michael Haynes. GT Bicycles had the first and the only mountain bike and BMX teams that are sponsored by Nike. GT had a total of 57 athletes on various teams in 1997, including nine mountain bike racers, 32 BMX racers and 16 freestyle/GT Bicycle Air Show performers. Gary Turner & Richard Long 1981 A week before GT's debut at the 1996 Summer Olympic, GT co-founder Richard Long was killed on July 12 in a motorcycle accident on his Honda Valkyrie en route to a national championship series race for the National Off-Road Bicycle Association at Big Bear Lake in the San Bernardino mountains. At the time of Long's death, GT maintained an office at the factory in Santa Ana as well as a factory in Huntington Beach -- and manufactured 600,000 bicycles annually under the GT, Powerlite, Robinson and Dyno brands, distributed bikes, parts and accessories via its Riteway network and had annual revenues of $150 million. Less than two years after Long's death, in 1998, Bain Capital sold GT to another investment group, Questor Partners, which at the time also owned Schwinn, for $175 million. Five years to the day that Richard Long had died, Questor would file for bankruptcy on June 27, 2001, and was acquired by Pacific Cycle, which was in turn acquired by Canadian company Dorel Industries in 2004. Teams As well as the manufacturing of bicycles, GT Bikes sponsored several teamsGT Bikes Team home page competing in BMX, mountain and road competitions. GT Factory BMX Racing Team There are six riders on the BMX Race Team: Riley O'Neil, Luke Madill, Joey Bradford, Eric Rupe and Arielle Martin (Verhaaren), which compete in competitions held globally. GT BMX Freestyle Team (GT Air Show) BMX Freestyle and GT BMX have a well documented history on video and in magazine coverage from publications like Freestylin/Go, BMX Plus, and Ride which all fostered young talent like Eddie Fiola, Spike Jonze, Eddie Roman, and Mark Eaton and helped an entire generation of riders define themselves and their sport. From the mid-eighties onward, Team GT's Pro Freestyle riders were some of the biggest and most recognizable names in BMX. The GT BMX brand and team riders appear in the 'HellTrack' starting lineup scene in the BMX cult-classic film Rad. Famous names from the ranks of Teams past include X-Games Champions Dave Mirra, Jay Miron, Jamie Bestwick, Eddie Fiola, aka King of the Skateparks, Brian Scura 'Rad Dad' inventor of the Gyro, aka SST Oryg, Trevor Meyer, Joey (Phenom) Phee, Martin 'the Chairman' Aparijo, Josh White, Dino DeLuca, Dave Voelker, Brett Hernandez, Kevin Jones, Mark Eaton, Gary Pollak, Kevin the 'Gute' Gutierrez, Ruben Castillo, Robert Castillo, Jason Geoffery, Bill Neuman, Goro Tamai, Krys Dauchy, and Adam Jung. Along with Team Haro, Team GT helped shape the future of BMX Freestyle and helped pioneer a sport once deemed nothing more than a fad. GT produced some of the first Freestyle specific bikes in their early Performer and World Tour models. Later highly successful models were the Pro Freestyle Tour, which saw the first use of mountain bike style brake mounts for use of Dia-Compe 990, Dyno Pro Compe - one of the most ridden flatland frames of the early Nineties. GT was also there for the birth of street riding in the late Eighties with the GT Aggressor (Designed in California, but frames made in Taiwan) and Dyno Slammer bashguard models. GT also designed and sold the first flatland specific bike in the USA: the GT Show. GT Bike's current Freestyle Team includes the riders: Dave Dillewaard, Rob Wise, Eric Bahlman, Justin Coble, Bobby Kanode, Calvin Krey, and Brian Kachinsky. Mountain Team Eight riders in the Mountain Team, compete in global competitions including downhill, four-cross, trials, freeride and dirt jumping. The riders in the team are: Marc Beaumont, Hans Rey, Eric Carter, Roger Rinderknecht, Kevin Aiello, and Tyler McCaul. In 2012, GT added Kyle Strait, Dan Atherton, Gee Atherton, and Rachel Atherton to the team. Hans Rey has been sponsored by GT since 1987. Road Team GT Bikes briefly served as team sponsors and bike supplier for Jelly Belly professional cycling team. After the 2009 season, the team ended their relationship with GT and began riding Focus bikes. Lotto pro cycling team (now Lotto-Belisol) at one time had Easton aluminium tubing GT frames. The team now rides on Ridley carbon frames. Co ‚Äì Factory Team The Co ‚Äì Factory Team was founded in 2008.GT Bikes co-factory team page. The team is composed of riders from across the US riding for local dealer teams that represent GT Bicycles. Notable past Factory team members Gary Ellis, Greg Hill, Rick Webb, Trevor Meyer, Geoff Scofield, Tommy Brackens, Mike King, Gabe Weed, Lee Medlin, Andy Patterson, \\"Chicken\\" George Seevers, Dave Voelker, Alexis Vergara, Terry Tenette, Randy Stumpfhauser, Thomas Allier, Mike Luna, In Hee Lee, Dave Brumlow, David Milham, Tom Haugen, Eddie Livingston, Danny Nelson, Josh White, Eddie Fiola, and Bob Morales. Past mountain bike team riders include Eric Carter, and Brian Lopes.

Madigan State Fish and Wildlife Area is a conservation area located in the U.S. state of Illinois. It is located south of Lincoln, Illinois. Founded in 1971 as Railsplitter State Park, it was renamed in 1995 in honor of Edward R. Madigan, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the town of Lincoln and a U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. The park is operated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). The horseshoe-shaped park surrounds the Lincoln Correctional Center/Logan Correctional Center, a complex of state facilities operated by the Illinois Department of Corrections. One of the park's primary assets is a section of Salt Creek, a major tributary of central Illinois' Sangamon River. Park resources Birds Edward R. Madigan is a principal pheasant hatchery for IDNR, producing 80,000 to 100,000 hatchlings annually. Upland birds hunted at Madigan include pheasants, doves, and quail. Fish DNR stated in 2006 that Salt Creek contained largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, bluegill, sunfish, crappie, drum, channel catfish, bullhead, and carp. The bluegill is the state fish of Illinois. Drum has also been caught here. Canoeing. and kayaking in Salt Creek are allowed during the daytime. Trees Trails totaling wind through wooded areas. The Madigan Salt Creek bottomlands contain one of Illinois's largest American sycamore trees. Outside the creek bed, the conservation area contains several groves of white oak and hickory, typical of central Illinois. The white oak is the state tree of Illinois. The state park also contains ash, hackberry, and black walnut trees. A herd of 100-150 deer graze the trees and brush. Access and historic road Old U.S. Highway 66, now Interstate Business 55, passes through the Madigan State Fish and Wildlife Area. The nearest limited-access exit to the Madigan State Fish and Wildlife Area is exit 123 on Interstate 55, where Business 55 intersects with Interstate 55. External links * Edward R.

For six decades, he was the host of their nationally syndicated radio show Your Watchman On The Wall, which is broadcast daily on stations across the USA. Your Watchman on The Wall's main focus is biblical prophecy and exposition of end times theories as well as conservative Christian apologetics. Hutchings also contributed to the ministry's two monthly publications, Bible in the News magazine and Prophetic Observer newsletter. Military service Noah Webster Hutchings was born on December 11, 1922, in Messer, Oklahoma.Southwest Radio Church broadcast, 11 December 2014 He was also one of six children. He graduated from Hugo High School in Hugo, Oklahoma, in 1939. In November 1942, Hutchings was drafted into the United States Army because of the rising threat from Japanese and German forces. After thirteen weeks of training, including physical and 155mm Howitzer, he went overseas. Hutchings had experience in the South Pacific while working as a radar technician. Hutchings completed his service during World War II and returned to Oklahoma. Predictions In 1974, the Southwest Radio Church's David Webber and Noah Hutchings co-authored the book Prophecy in Stone (Harvest Press) in which they suggested that the \\"rapture\\" would take place \\"possibly in 1987 or 1988.\\" In 1978, Southwest Radio Church published a pamphlet entitled God's Timetable for the 1980s in which were listed prophecies for each year of the 1980s, culminating with Christ's return and the establishment of his millennial kingdom on earth in 1989. In a 1979 book, Is This the Last Century? (Thomas Nelson) Webber and Hutchings again explicitly suggested \\"that the Tribulation will begin in 1981, that Christ will return in 1988\\" and that the \\"seven years from 1981 to 1988 will be the Tribulation period.\\" Hutchings wrote an article entitled \\"The Vatican Connection\\" for the magazine Gospel Truth in April 1984. In this article he explained why he thought Pope John Paul II might be the Antichrist spoken of in the Bible: \\"In Pope John Paul we see a man who is rising in international stature, a man who will be increasing called upon to bring peace to a troubled world. His recovery from a deadly wound directed world attention and admiration to his personage, and he, like those before him, would seemingly like to establish authority over the Holy Hill of Zion.\\" Y2K fears In 1998 Hutchings stirred up fears among his listeners and readers with dire predictions surrounding the Y2K computer problem. His two books on the subject were Y2K=666? (with Larry Spargimino) and Does Y2K Equal 666?, both published by Hearthstone Publishing in Oklahoma City. \\"We are living in the most perilous times since the flood in Noah's Day. Informed sources worldwide are now becoming alarmed. Some are predicting world famine, economic disasters, world rioting, and chaos with millions dying.\\" Hutchings' book was noted by the San Francisco Chronicle in a story published on October 3, 1998, \\"2000 Computer Bug Has Apocalyptic Overtones.\\" Chronicle religion writer Don Lattin wrote, \\"The alarmist response to Y2K in evangelical circles reminds many fundamentalist Christians of Bible prophecies about the Great Tribulation, a future period of violent social chaos, and the rise of the Antichrist -- two events that many fundamentalist Christians believe must precede the second coming of Jesus Christ.\\" \\"Radio evangelist Noah Hutchings has been preaching that message over the airwaves for 48 years. His Southwest Radio Church out of Oklahoma City is heard on 100 radio stations across the country, including KCBC in Northern California.\\" \\"That number, 666,\\" Lattin noted, \\"is a powerful Christian symbol of the 'mark of the beast,' the Antichrist described in the apocalyptic visions in the Book of Revelation. In recent years, some fundamentalist Christians have identified the Antichrist with the megacomputer at the World Bank, seeing an evil plot in the rise of global electronic banking, bar codes on nearly every product and computerized mailing lists for nearly every address.\\" Lattin then quotes from Hutchings: \\"Whether you like it or not, you have a mark and a number in the government's computer data bank.\\" Another article in the Wall Street Journal quoted Hutchings speculation that \\"computers, with their ability to know 'all about us . . . whether we've been good or bad,' might be a tool of the Antichrist to bring down civilization.\\" Hutchings had co-authored an earlier book with David Webber entitled Computers and the Beast of Revelation (Huntington House, 1986). Other Topics and Beliefs Hutchins also frequently commented on his belief that giants have walked the earth, the sunken city of Atlantis is real, UFOs are to be taken seriously, the world was subject to the Biblical Noachian Flood, Egyptian pyramids survived the Biblical flood essentially intact, the universe is 6000 years old, dinosaurs walked the earth with humans, and evolution being false. Of late, Hutchings had been involved with Ken Klein in a new production claiming that the temple mount was never the site of the Jewish Temple. Academic credentials challenged Noah Hutchings had been criticized by a fellow evangelical Christian, William Alnor, as claiming doctorate and graduate degrees which he did not legitimately possess. However, the aforementioned Larry Spargimino, Hutchings' right-hand man, holds legitimate M.Div. and Ph.D. degrees, from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. In an August 2004 article for The Christian Sentinel, Alnor wrote \\"The 'Dr.' title is bestowed on him repeatedly throughout the ministry's website, and even graces the covers of some of his published books under the by-line 'Dr. Noah Hutchings.'\\" Alnor reports that he contacted Hutchings, who conceded that his only earned degree was a bachelor's in accounting. Hutchings had no seminary training and no formal education in theology or biblical studies. Hutchings was simply referred to as \\"Rev.\\" on the Southwest Radio Church Ministries website. His bio there mentions that he had been the recipient of two honorary doctorates, one from St. Charles University‚Äîa diploma mill in California‚Äîand one from American Bible College and Seminary in Oklahoma City (now defunct). Neither of those institutions has been regionally accredited, although American Bible College and Seminary was nationally accredited through TRACS.Academic accreditation. Rick Miesel had accused Hutchings of promoting the doctrine of the \\"Gospel in the Stars\\", the idea that the astrological signs really refer to the Bible. Death Hutchings died at the age of 92 on June 17, 2015. He was interred at the Rose Hill Burial Park in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He was survived by his wife, 1 sister, 7 children and 13 grandchildren.

Early life Burt Baskin was born in Streator, Illinois on December 17, 1913, to Mr. and Mrs. Harry Baskin. The son of Harold Baskin, a Russian-Jewish immigrant who had arrived in the United States in 1925 and who owned a clothing store.http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01921-print.html He graduated from Streator Township High School in 1931 and from the University of Illinois in 1935 and was a member of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. Harry Baskin had immigrated from Russia about 1925, married in about 1902 and moved to Streator in 1905 or before. The Baskin family operated a clothing store in Streator until Harry retired in 1942. Business career Burt Baskin owned a men's store in the Palmer House in Chicago, and married Irv Robbins' sister Shirley in 1942. He had enlisted in the Navy. He served with Patrol Wing 1 (Later renamed Fleet Air Wing 1) in Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu in 1942-3 and was released from service early 1946 and came to California, where Robbins had been operating Snowbird Ice Cream in Glendale. Robbins convinced him that selling ice cream was more fun than selling men's ties and shirts, and within a couple of months he opened Burton's Ice Cream at 561 So. Lake, Pasadena, California. By 1948, the five Snowbird and three Burton's shops had been combined into a single enterprise, and they had devised their 31st flavor‚ÄîChocolate Mint. The partners came to the conclusion that because of the new stores they had opened, they were devoting less and less time to each individual store. \\"That's when we hit on selling our stores to our managers,\\" Robbins said in the 1985 Los Angeles Times story. \\"Without realizing it at the time, we were in the franchise business before the word 'franchise' was fashionable. We opened another store and another and another. . . .\\" They made an agreement with the new store owners, which became \\"franchise agreements\\" and they became the first food company ever to franchise their outlets. The idea took hold in other retail establishments, and the age of \\"franchising\\" was underway. In 1949, with more than 40 stores, Baskin and Robbins purchased their first dairy in Burbank, allowing them \\"to have complete control over the production of their ice cream, and the development of new ingredients and flavors.\\" In 1953, they decided to unite Snowbird and Burton's under one name: Baskin-Robbins, deciding the order of their names with a coin toss. The \\"31 flavors\\" concept was introduced that same year to bring attention to a deep menu that featured a flavor for every day of the month. The company had 43 stores by the end of 1949, more than 100 by 1960 and about 500 when the ice cream empire was sold to United Fruit Company for an estimated $12 million in 1967. Robbins stayed involved with the company for 11 more years and retired in 1978. Twenty-five years later, Baskin-Robbins had become the world's largest chain of ice cream stores, with 5,500 outlets around the world. Personal life Burt and Irv first met in 1941 when Burt began dating Irv's sister, Shirley Robbins, whom he married in Tacoma, Washington in 1942. He served as a Lieutenant Commander of Naval Reserve in the South Pacific during World War II. Burt and Shirley had two children: Edie and Richard Baskin. Baskin died from a heart attack at his home in Studio City, California on December 24, 1967. He was interred at Home of Peace Cemetery.

He co-founded the Baskin-Robbins ice cream parlor chain in 1945 with his partner and brother-in-law Burt Baskin. Early life Robbins was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, to a Jewish family. His father, Aaron Robbins, owned a dairy and The Olympic Store ice cream business at 954 Court C in Tacoma, Washington, US. He attended both Tacoma's Stadium High School, where he was a yell leader, and Seattle's Garfield High School. Robbins grew up scooping cones in his family's ice cream store for customers who always seemed to be having a good time. He recalled that he often \\"finished a day's work happy\\" and wanted that same feeling when he started his own business. Irv Robbins attended the University of Washington in Seattle, was a member of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity, and graduated with a degree in Political Science. He served in the U.S. Army as a Staff Sergeant in California, during World War II and was discharged August 1945. Business career After getting out of the Army in 1945, he soon opened the Snowbird Ice Cream store on December 7, 1945 in Glendale, California. Robbins cashed in a $6,000 insurance policy given him for his bar mitzvah to start the business. Burt Baskin owned a men's store in the Palmer House in Chicago, and married Robbins' sister Shirley in 1942. He had enlisted in the Navy and was released from service early 1946 and came to California, where Robbins convinced him that selling ice cream was more fun than selling men's ties & shirts, and within a couple of months he opened Burton's Ice Cream at 561 So. Lake Pasadena, California. By 1948, the five Snowbird and three Burton's shops had been combined into a single enterprise, and they had devised their 31st flavor‚ÄîChocolate Mint. The partners came to the conclusion that because of the new stores they had opened, they were devoting less and less time to each individual store. \\"That's when we hit on selling our stores to our managers,\\" Robbins said in the 1985 Los Angeles Times story. \\"Without realizing it at the time, we were in the franchise business before the word 'franchise' was fashionable. We opened another store and another and another. . . .\\" They made an agreement with the new store owners, which became \\"franchise agreements\\" and they became the first food company ever to franchise their outlets. Little did the McDonald's and Burger Kings of the future know, but the idea took hold in other retail establishments, and the age of \\"franchising\\" was underway. In 1953, they renamed the company Baskin-Robbins, deciding the order of their names with a coin toss. The \\"31 flavors\\" concept was introduced that same year to bring attention to a deep menu that featured a flavor for every day of the month. Baskin-Robbins had 43 stores by the end of 1949, more than 100 by 1960 and about 500 when the ice cream empire was sold to United Fruit Company for an estimated $12 million in 1967. Six months later, Burt Baskin died of a heart attack at 54. Robbins stayed involved with the company for 11 more years and retired in 1978. 25 years later Baskin-Robbins had become the world's largest chain of ice cream stores, with 5,500 outlets around the world. Baskin-Robbins is now a part of Dunkin' Brands. Personal life Robbins was Jewish. He married Irma Gevurtz in 1942, just before he went to serve in the U.S. Army. Robbins and Irma had three children: Marsha, John (author of the 1987 book Diet for a New America), and Erin. Baskin and his wife Shirley had two children, Edie and Richard. Robbins died of natural causes near his home in Rancho Mirage, California, at the age of 90.

The programme was first aired on 19 September 1994. It had a quirky, relaxed style, especially when compared to other BBC business shows such as World Business Report. In April 2010, the BBC announced that the programme was being cancelled at the end of July 2010. GMT with George Alagiah took its place in the schedule at 12:30 on BBC Two.BBC's Working Lunch show to end BBC News, 23 April 2010.Goodbye message from Working Lunch BBC News, 30 July 2010. Graphics The original title sequence created by Piers Helm, featured a real goldfish and a rubber shark in a tank that contained the programme's subject matter represented as kitsch fish tank objects. These objects were a treasure chest, bank, factory and a version of the Richard Rogers Lloyds building. The title sequence led to a virtual set that was designed to look like a converted warehouse when in fact, the studio it came from was the smallest BBC News studio. By 2000, the title sequence had been changed by BBC Design to a computer generated sequence in which a goldfish is trying to escape from a shark on board a sunken ship. The programme graphics also reflected this style with a marine-themed studio background. Other graphics were in a \\"crude clipart\\" style. 2008 relaunch The show was relaunched on 6 October 2008, with new titles, set and presenters. The familiar goldfish and shark were replaced by a piggy bank. Presenters Paddy O'Connell, Adam Shaw and Nik Wood, were replaced by Declan Curry and Naga Munchetty, the latter joining from Bloomberg TV. The new format was unpopular with viewers and the vast majority of comments about it were negative. Presenters and reporters Originally, the show was presented by Adrian Chiles and Adam Shaw. Chiles left the programme on 26 January 2007 after years, to become the co-host of the BBC One current affairs and lifestyle programme The One Show. He was replaced by Nik Wood.

Founded at Wesleyan University in 1870 as a chapter of Skull and Bones,\\"A History of Wesleyan College Fraternities\\" The Wesleyan Review, May, 1990 the society accepts members regardless of their fraternity status.\\"Theta Nu Epsilon Society to Hold Convention Here\\" The New York Times, March 16, 1913 Early history Theta Nu Epsilon was founded on December 11, 1870 in Room Seven of Wesleyan‚Äôs South College by Herbert Hull Coston, Coleridge Allen Hart, George Washington Shonk, Lyman Horace Weeks, (all four Alpha Delta Phi), Benjamin Emmons Gerst, Arthur Collins McClay, George Bickford Davey Toy, (all four Delta Kappa Epsilon), Stephen Judson Kirby, George Henry Towle, Alfred Charles True, (all four Eclectic), George William Elliott, Charles Hamlin Furber, William Henry Lawrence, Olin Levings Livesey, (all four Psi Upsilon), Amos Howard Hoagland, (independent). Founded as the Wesleyan chapter of Skull & Bones, two years later the chapter cut its ties to Yale and changed the bones of the Skull & Bones emblem to keys.\\"Wesleyan Argus\\", Wesleyan Argus, History of Theta Nu Epsilon and connection to Skull & Bones, October 10, 1987. Class societies were once common in northeastern American colleges and universities. There were freshman, sophomore, junior and senior class societies. Membership was by class year, and cut across the fraternity membership lines. Some class societies became fraternities outside the northeast; DKE and Alpha Sigma Phi were founded as class societies. Yale's Skull & Bones, Cornell's Quill and Dagger, and Theta Nu Epsilon were probably the most famous and successful class societies. T.N.E. is a sophomore class society, and in a traditional type chapter, members were chosen near the end of their freshman or start of their sophomore year. Once selected, the new members were active and responsible for operation of the chapter during their sophomore year. As juniors and seniors, they were considered honorary members and only had authority in an advisory role. The society always excluded freshmen. From the beginning, the identities of the sophomore members were kept secret. In yearbooks, the names of the sophomores appeared in code. The Alpha chapter and legitimate chapters continue this traditional type. Several latter types of chapters developed over time: one type is that of the three- year society, adopted by chapters at many institutions without a class society system, a third type was as a feeder organization to a senior society, a fourth type was where the chapter acted as an interfraternity coordinating body, and a fifth type was as a wholly secret society, (which were usually chapters that had notorious reputations, such as the University of Alabama). National organization Theta Nu Epsilon had immediate success at Wesleyan, and it grew rapidly and spread throughout colleges across the United States. The Alpha chapter at Wesleyan acted as the national organization and continued to grant charters until 1907. The society's first convention was at the Delevan House hotel in Albany in 1885, and conventions were held annually thereafter. A movement for a formal national organization resulted in a convention was held at the Hotel Astor in New York on March 29 and 30, 1907. The convention established a national governing body which was incorporated the society under the laws of the State of New York. The new national organization was given the authority to manage the national operations of TNE and grant new chapters.\\"Theta Nu Epsilon Convention\\". The New York Times. March 19, 1907 Internal struggles As early as the turn of the century, there were chapters created informally and without official sanction, especially in the South. The new national organization attempted to unify all chapters of the society, but the process proceeded slowly. Some illicit chapters became very problematic for the society. Several of these chapters were banned from campuses, and many fraternities prohibited members from accepting membership in the society. These events negatively affected the reputation of the society. Also, because of internal differences in the society, in the 1910s, many of the older legitimate chapters reorganized themselves as independent organizations which were loosely allied across campuses. In 1913, the National Interfraternity Conference (predecessor to the current North American Interfraternity Conference) officially announced its opposition to T.N.E. and recommended to the fraternities represented in the conference that they forbid their members to join Theta Nu Epsilon\\"Make Fraternity Rules\\". The New York Times. November 30, 1913 The relations between Theta Nu Epsilon and the N.I.C. improved and the N.I.C. retracted its opposition at its session in New York, 1925.Banta's Greek Exchange, Report of the Executive Secretary to the Fifteenth Convention of Theta Nu Epsilon, April 1926, pg. 131. Theta Nu Epsilon was later accepted as a member of the N.I.C. in the 1930s. An attempt was made to convert a small portion of the then existing chapters into a four-year college fraternity in the 1930s. At the same time, some of the most notorious activity seems to have been among some illegitimate chapters in the far West in the late 1930s and 40s. It is frequently assumed that all Theta Nu Epsilon members are also members of four- year college fraternities, but that has never been a requirement of membership. However, it is true that very many members have been members of four-year fraternities. There have been chapters that have operated exclusively that way, and the independent former chapter at Alabama is a well- known example of a group operating solely as an interfraternity coordinating organization. Post WWII history Although the national organization stopped operating in World War II, some of the chapters of that national continued into the late 1940s. Henry Kelly ultimately merged his efforts with the Alpha chapter. Some, but not all, of these independent chapters began initiating women as members in the 1970s. The national organization of the Alpha chapter currently reports chapters at Wesleyan, the University of Missouri, the University of New Mexico, and the University of Virginia. Several of the older chapters that separated in the early 1900s have survived as independent entities on their respective campuses. These include Skull & Keys at the University of California, Berkeley, Skull and Bones at Yale University, The Phoenix ‚Äì S K Club at Harvard University, the Tejas Club at the University of Texas at Austin, The Machine at the University of Alabama, Skull Society at the University of Maine, Cap and Skull at Rutgers University, and a group using the T.N.E. name at the University of Nebraska. Official chapters Because of early splits in the national organization, several unofficial national coalitions and rogue groups granted their own charters. As a result, many conflicts exist surrounding the actual founding dates and chapter designations, even at the institutions that had officially recognized groups.

Africa in the United Nations System. Page 141. He changed his views on militant struggle in the late 1970s and supported the 'internal settlement', serving in the attempted power-sharing governments. Early life Chikerema was born at Kutama Mission in Zvimba, in present-day Mashonaland West province; Robert Mugabe, who was his nephew, shared the same birthplace and the two were very close during childhood. He was educated at St. Francis Xavier College in Kutama, and in South Africa. He became President of the Southern Rhodesia National Youth League and in 1956 led a bus boycott by Africans to protest at their lack of political power (the electoral system in Rhodesia made it very difficult for Africans to be eligible). With Didymus Mutasa, George Nyandoro, Guy Clutton-Brock, Michael and Eileen Haddon, white liberals who donated their land, he helped create Cold Comfort Farm to improve African farming methods and then form the African National Congress. The ANC campaigned for an extension of the franchise, but was banned within two years of its birth. Ally of Nkomo Together with Joshua Nkomo, Chikerema formed the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress in 1957 to press for meaningful reform. Although not a violent movement, the Southern Rhodesia government banned the group in 1960, and restricted its leading members to the Gokwe area. Chikerema remained with Nkomo when he established the National Democratic Party soon after; when this was also banned, Nkomo and Chikerema launched the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU). When the government banned this group, it remained in existence as a clandestine organisation. The movement restrictions on Nkomo and Chikerema were removed by the incoming government of Winston Field in early 1963. On 9 February 1963 Nkomo and Chikerema together with Maurice Nyagumbo and Daniel Madzimbamuto were arrested while eating supper at Nkomo's house in Rusape under the Law and Order Maintenance Act 1960, and charged with taking part in an illegal procession and hindering the police. Herbert Chitepo was their defence counsel at trial, but could not prevent them being convicted. Chikerema was sentenced to six months' imprisonment (three months of which were suspended). Their convictions were overturned on appeal. Exiled leader of ZAPU During Nkomo's detention, Chikerema went into exile first in Zambia where he was acting President of ZAPU. He argued for a referendum of all adults of Southern Rhodesia on whether it should have independence, and opposed the government's use of the House of Chiefs as a means of consulting African opinion. When Ian Smith's government increasingly threatened a unilateral declaration of independence, Chikerema declared the willingness of ZAPU to take up armed struggle, promising \\"a campaign of terror\\" in which \\"at first we will attack white farms in isolated areas, and with the arms we capture there, we will attack white homes in the towns\\". Following UDI, Chikerema took charge of ZAPU's guerrilla war. FROLIZI In 1971 ZAPU split, with Chikerema joining instead the Front for the Liberation of Zimbabwe (FROLIZI). After the collapse of talks in Lusaka in December 1974, Chikerema on behalf of FROLIZI signed an agreement with Nkomo of ZAPU and Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) to unite with the African National Council of Rev. Abel Muzorewa. Unlike the other leaders, Chikerema remained in exile fearing arrest and imprisonment or execution should he return to Rhodesia. Because of this, when the Rhodesian government agreed to talks in 1975, the venue chosen was a railway carriage on the bridge over the Victoria Falls: the carriage was placed in the middle of the bridge so that the ANC delegation was in Zambia while the Rhodesians were still in Rhodesia. Shortly after the talks the accord within the ANC fell apart with Chikerema siding with Sithole and Muzorewa against Nkomo and Robert Mugabe. In February 1976 Chikerema issued a press statement that the armed struggle was likely to resume, saying that the United Kingdom abdicated responsibility by failing to send troops against the Rhodesian government after UDI, and that any troops then sent to Rhodesia would be fought by the ANC. Alliance with Muzorewa Increasingly, Chikerema grew politically close to Muzorewa. He became the first vice-President of the United African National Council which Muzorewa had founded, and was allowed to return to Rhodesia in September 1977. At a meeting the next month he caused uproar among the white audience by arguing that there were no terrorists in Rhodesia, merely freedom fighters. He became highly critical of the Patriotic Front formed by Mugabe's ZANU and Nkomo's ZAPU, and accused the United Kingdom of supporting ZAPU. Chikerema participated in the internal settlement talks of 1978 and supported the proposal of reserving 28 seats for white voters in a majority-rule Parliament. In his memoirs, Ian Smith remarks that he was \\"a constant source of help in bringing things back to sanity\\". When agreement was reached he said that guerrillas who continued fighting after the multi-racial election would be \\"severely dealt with\\". During the transitional government, he was made co-Minister for Transport and Power, a surprisingly lowly post given his stature; the apparent snub was explained by the fact that he lacked professional training in any of the areas of government. In July 1978 the Department of Information called a press conference at which a man appeared claiming to have been sent by ZIPRA (ZAPU's military wing) to assassinate four of the co-Ministers, including Chikerema. Media James Chikerema together with Raymond Chinamora were the editors of a weekly liberation struggle newspaper called The Rise of Zimbabwe. Later life On 29 June 1979 after Abel Muzorewa took over as Prime Minister, Chikerema led a group of seven members of the House of Assembly to split with him due to concerns about his lack of firmness. They formed the Zimbabwe Democratic Party, having to fight through the courts for their right to keep their seats. Following the Lancaster House Agreement, the Zimbabwe Democratic Party stood in the 1980 elections. Chikerema complained about intimidation by ZANU-PF supporters during the campaign, and was distraught when his party failed to win any seats. That marked the end of Chikerema's active political career, but he continued to comment through newspaper interviews on the political situation in Zimbabwe. He attained the status of 'elder statesman' and while he was not necessarily in line with the majority view, he was listened to with considerable respect based on his previous campaigns. In 1993, he joined the Forum Party of Zimbabwe, (whose founder was ex-Chief Justice Enoch Dumbutshena) re-entering the political arena; the Forum Party's 25 candidates in the 1995 elections failed to make an impact. The farm he owned was designated for purchase by the Zimbabwe government soon after he formed the party, and in 2000 it was included in the list of farms to be compulsorily purchased without compensation.Obituaries: James Chikerema, The Times, April 4, 2006 Chikerema remarked \\"As far as I'm concerned, it's Mugabe's vendetta against me\\". Chikerema made it clear that he supported orderly land redistribution if it was conducted fairly. Chikerema died in the United States, where he had gone for medical treatment.

Indian Affairs and Northern Development In the 1980s, Penner was Chair of the Standing Committee on Indian Affairs and Northern Development. The Committee released a report on Native Self-governance in 1983. Often referred to as the Penner Report, it recommended the recognition of First Nations people as a distinct, constitutionally protected order of government within Canada and with a full range of government powers. The Report recommended that the provinces be removed from any jurisdiction concerning Aboriginal affairs and that a government structure for First Nations be regarded as the equivalent to a province, with financial support from the federal government in an arrangement that would be recognised in the Constitution of Canada. While the Liberal government of the day tabled in the House of Commons a relatively favourable response on March 5, 1984, a few months later Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau had resigned, John Turner became Prime Minister, Indian Affairs Minister John Munro was not named by Turner as a Minister, and in September 1984, the Conservative Government of Brian Mulroney swept into power.

It was built on the foundations of the palace of the Sapa Inca T√∫pac Amaru. A major earthquake struck and damaged the building in 1650. In the process of reconstruction, a Baroque-style chapel was built. In the mid-20th century, the Jesuits obtained the financial support of Cardinal Richard Cushing, the Archbishop of Boston, for the building of a new seminary. The school moved to this new facility in 1965. Hotel At that point, the seminary buildings were acquired and remodeled into the hotel that it is now.

She served as President of the English Place-Name Society from 1986 to 1998, and Vice-President of the International Council of Onomastic Sciences from 1993 to 1999, as well as being a Fellow of St Hilda's College, Oxford, and member of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and the British Academy. Born in Manchester and raised in Kent, she studied at St Hilda's College, becoming involved in socialist activism. She proceeded to work for the English Place-Name Society from 1946 to 1953, focusing her research on the place-names of Oxfordshire and Berkshire. Marrying archaeologist Peter Gelling of the University of Birmingham in 1952, she moved to Harborne in Birmingham while undertaking her PhD research into the place-names of West Berkshire. Lecturing on the subject across the Midlands, she published her research in a series of books, achieving prominence within academia for her 1978 work Signposts to the Past: The Geographical Roots of Britain's Place-names. In the coming decades she focused on researching the place-names of Shropshire, resulting in a multi-volume publication, earning a number of awards and prominent appointments for her life's work. Gelling's work focused on establishing the Old English origins of English place-names in the Midlands, and her approach sought to connect toponyms to geographical features in the landscape. Biography Early life: 1924-1951 Margaret Joy Midgley was born to a lower-middle-class family in Manchester on 29 November 1924, the daughter of an insurance salesman. As a child, her family moved to Sidcup in Kent, and she gained her secondary education from Chislehurst Grammar School. The first member of her family to attend university, she studied English language and literature at St Hilda's College, Oxford, where she was influenced by Dorothy Whitelock, who inspired her interest in place-names. Graduating in 1945, she later related that the experience at Oxford had been a \\"waste of time\\", believing English literature to be \\"dreadfully boring\\". Politically a socialist, at Oxford she had joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, and enjoyed arguing politics with her right-wing family. Working for a year as a temporary civil servant in London, in 1946 she gained employment as a research assistant with the English Place-Name Society, based in Cambridge. She continued to work here for eight years, focusing her research on expanding and collating the place-names of Oxfordshire and Berkshire, a project that had been started before her by Frank Merry Stenton and his wife Lady Doris Stenton; her work in this field would see publication as the two volume The Place-Names of Oxfordshire (1953‚Äì54). She felt that her approach differed from Stenton's on political grounds; she believed most place-names had been developed by ordinary working people, whereas she thought that he \\"empathised with the ruling classes.\\" Success: 1952-2009 In 1952 she married the Manx archaeologist Peter Gelling, who soon obtained a teaching job at the University of Birmingham. For this reason, the couple moved to Harborne where she remained for the rest of her life. There, she would spend much time gardening, and although had no children of her own, raised her nephew, Adrian Midgley, from the age of six. She would undertake research for a PhD from the University of London by correspondence, supervised by Albert Hugh Smith; devoted to the place-names of West Berkshire, her thesis was completed in 1957. Having left the Communist Party, she still considered herself \\"very left-wing\\", campaigning on behalf of the local branch of the centre-left Labour Party. She accompanied her husband on his archaeological excavations to various sites, both domestically and abroad. In the 1960s, she accompanied him to Alto Plano in Peru to study the development of potato cultivation, where she gained experience in cooking at high altitude. In the early 1970s, she travelled with him to Cyprus, where she was sorting through finds in the castle at Kyrenia when the Turkish army invaded in July 1974. For a number of seasons she managed morale and catering at the excavation camp at Deerness, Orkney, which her husband used as a training dig for his students. During the 1960s, she published a series of innovative books on English place-names, also lecturing on the subject across the English Midlands under the aegis of the University of Birmingham's Department of Extra-Mural Studies. She also lectured at Birmingham University on occasion, as well as running a summer school at Oxford. She went on to publish her three volumes of The Place-Names of Berkshire (1973, 1974 and 1976), which she followed with Signposts to the Past: Place-Names and the History of England (1978), a book which \\"put her in an elevated position among English toponymists\\" and which saw revised editions in 1987 and 1997. Peter Gelling died in 1983, while Margaret took on the presidency of the English Place-Name Society from 1986 to 1998, and then the Vice-Presidency of the International Council for Onomastic Sciences from 1993 to 1999. Becoming a fellow of St Hilda's College in 1993, she was awarded an Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1995, and in 1998, she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy, a rare feat for an individual who had never held an academic position. She continued lecturing widely until developing the illness from which she died.

Rab27 is post translationally modified by the addition of two geranylgeranyl groups on the two C-terminal cysteines. Pathology Mutations that prevent the expression of Rab27 ('knock out' mutations) cause the hypopigmentation and immunodeficiency disorder known as type II Griscelli syndrome, while a decrease in Rab27 prenylation is thought to be involved in choroideremia. The symptoms of type II Griscelli syndrome have shown that Rab27 is involved in melanosome transport in melanocytes and in cytotoxic killing activity in cytotoxic T lymphoblasts. In melanocytes Rab27 binds the melanosome. The melanosome is transported along the microtubule. Rab27 then recruits Slac2A and myosin Va, these enzymes are essential for the transfer of the melanosomes from the microtubules to actin filaments. The melanosomes can now continue on their path towards the cell periphery. If either Rab27, Slac2A or myosin Va are absent then the melanosomes remain in the perinuclear region of the cell. This disruption in pigmentation results in the hypopigmentation seen in the silvery hair colour of patients with Griscelli syndrome.

It is bounded by the comuni of Albano di Lucania, Anzi, Laurenzana, Pietrapertosa, Trivigno. It is part of the club The most beautiful villages in Italy. In 2007 Castelmezzano was chosen by Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel magazine among \\"The best places you've never heard of\\". The Telegraph included Castelmezzano among its \\"Italy's 19 most beautiful villages\\" list in 2017, defining it \\"one of southern Italy's most stunningly located villages\\". History The origins of Castelmezzano date to approximately between the 6th and 5th centuries BC, when Greek settlers got into the valley of Basento and founded a town called Maudoro, meaning roughly the world of gold. In the 10th century AD, the Saracen invasions forced the local population to find a new location. It is said that during the exodus, a shepherd called Paolino discovered a place to move to, formed by rocks from the steep peaks of which one could repel the invaders by means of rolling stone boulders on to them. After the occupation by the Lombards, the Normans settled there between the 11th and 13th century AD and built a castle (of which are still visible the remains of the walls and tier of rocks which allowed access to the higher lookout point). It was from the name of the castle (Castrum Medianum, roughly means Castle in the Middle) that the town derived its name, the castle so named because of its position between those of Pietrapertosa and Albano di Lucania. With the Normans, Castelmezzano experienced a period of peace and development, until under the Angevins it experienced a sharp decline. With the arrival of the Aragonese, between the 14th and 16th century, many landowners received Castelmezzano as fief, although the economic and social conditions remained mostly unchanged. Only with the appointment of Baron Giovanni Antonio De Leonardis (whose family governed the town from 1580 to 1686), did development take place. Subsequently, it passed by marriage to the De Lerma, who held it until 1805, when feudalism was suppressed in southern Italy. In the 19th century, Castelmezzano was affected by brigandage. Due to its location, rich in natural hiding places among the rocks and lush vegetation, it was an ideal refuge for many bandits. At the end of the century, the town suffered a major migratory exodus, which prompted many families to move overseas. Main sights *Mother church of Santa Maria dell'Olmo *Church of Santo Sepolcro *Chapel of Madonna dell‚ÄôAnnunziata Events Volo dell'Angelo The Volo dell'Angelo (Angel Flight) is a high-speed zip line crossing the valley between Castelmezzano and neighbouring Pietrapertosa, offering a suggestive view at over 400 metres (1,300 feet) from the ground at speeds of 120 km/h (70 mph). Inaugurated in 2007, the event is held annually between May and November. The Percorso delle Sette Pietre (Seven Stones Path) is a literary walk inspired by Mimmo Sammartino‚Äôs book Vito ballava con le streghe (Vito danced with the witches), based on ancient stories handed down orally. Each path includes a space that evokes a sequence of the story, with a sound environment that offers additional suggestions to the magic of nature revealed.
