It is located on Stumperlowe Hall Road at its junction with Slayleigh Lane in the suburb of Fulwood. The hall is a Grade II listed building. History The present day house dates from 1854, but a previous hall was built on the same site in the 1650s by Robert Hall, a descendant of the Mitchells, an ancient Hallamshire family who had held land in the Stumperlowe area since the end of the 14th century. Robert Hall and his wife Dorothy lived at Stumperlowe Hall for over fifty years, the couple had a son Henry Hall who also resided at the hall for a time. By 1716 the grandchildren of Robert Hall had to surrender the house by order of the Sheffield Manor Court and it was purchased by Daniel Gascoigne of Sheffield, an apothecary and John Hawksworth, a lead merchant. The hall was the residence and estate of Mr. Hawksworth and his family for most of the remaining years of the 18th century. Hunter‘s Hallamshire (Google Books Gives early history. The hall was completely transformed in 1854 when it came into the possession of Henry Isaac Dixon (1820-1912) of Page Hall. Dixon was part owner of the Britannia metal manufacturing company James Dixon & Sons of Cornish Place. Dixon rebuilt and extended the hall in a subtle and sensitive style, introducing more light into the house by replacing the original mullioned windows with larger areas of glass. Dixon was also a generous patron of the Fulwood area providing money for tree planting and for the expansion of Christ Church on Canterbury Avenue. Henry Isaac Dixon died in 1912 and his son James Dixon (1851-1947) moved into the hall, James Dixon had taken over the running of the family firm in 1877 and was elected as one of the youngest ever Master Cutlers in 1887 at the age of 36. He moved out of Stumperlowe Hall in 1924, at the age of 73, although he lived until he was 96 years old. rootsweb Gives details of Dixon family. After the Dixons, the hall was home for several families. In 1957 the hall was purchased by Lady Kenning, widow of Sir George Kenning, who had made a fortune by car sales and distribution through his firm now known as the GK Group. Lady Kenning died in 1974 and the hall has remained a family home since.\\"Sheffield‘s Remarkable Houses\\", Roger Redfern, The Cottage Press, , Pages 30/31 Gives historical details of house.

In 2007, Ajoka performed a piece that was written and directed by Gauhar, called Burqavaganza (Burqa-vaganza), which led to great controversy. Actors dressed in burkas put themes on the stage like sexual discrimination, intolerance and fanaticism. From a Western perspective, the piece was a rather innocent performance on hypocrisy of a society that bathes in corruption. In her own country though, Members of Parliament called for a ban of it, and the Minister of Culture threatened with sanctions when it would be staged any longer. In spite of the ban, non-governmental organisations and women's rights activists had the theatre piece translated into English and staged performances internationally as a sign of support to Ajoka.Rehman, Sonya (20 June 2008) Viva Ajoka!, Sonya Rehman's Archive ~ Of Most Things PakistaniBorah, Prabalika M. (4 May 2011) Voice beyond LOC, The Hindu On 23 August 2008, Alhamra Arts Council hosted the launch of Selected Plays published by Oxford University Press (OUP) and written by Shahid Nadeem with the help of Ajoka. The book contains seven of his famous plays Teesri Dastak, Barri, Aik Thi Nani, Kala Meda Bhes, Dukhini, Bulha and Burqavaganza. The book again launched at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA), Islamabad on 25 August 2008 with the help of Pakistan Academy of Letters. His book, Selected Plays, a collection of his six famous plays in an English translation was published by OUP in August 2008. Two collections of his Urdu and Punjabi plays has been published. In 2012, Nadeem wrote a play Kaun Hai Yeh Gustakh, directed by Madeeha Gauhar and first played at Alhamra Arts Council, Lahore on 14 December by Ajoka. The play is based on the life of Saadat Hassan Manto, and was well received by audiences. Manto was played by Naseem Abbas. In January 2013 the play was presented at the Akshara Theatre in New Delhi, India. The play was due to be presented at the National School of Drama (NSD) in New Delhi but was cancelled due to security concerns. In February 2013, play was held at Nishtar Hall, Peshawar by Ajoka.

Watsu is characterized by one-on-one sessions in which a practitioner or therapist gently cradles, moves, stretches, and massages a receiver in chest-deep warm water. Watsu, originally developed by Harold Dull at Harbin Hot Springs, California in the early 1980s, combines elements of muscle stretching, joint mobilization, massage, Shiatsu, and dance, performed in chest-deep warm water (around 35°C = 95°F). The receiver is continuously supported by a practitioner or therapist while being backfloated, rhythmically cradled, moved, stretched, and massaged.Dutton, M. 2011. Orthopaedics for the physical therapist assistant. Jones & Bartlett Learning. p 187. (Watsu) . Schoedinger, P. 2011. Watsu in aquatic rehabilitation. pp 137-153, Chapter 5 In: Becker, BE and Cole, AJ (eds). Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. .Jamison, L. 2009. Watsu. pp 117-128, Chapter 8 In: Brody, LT and Geigle, PR (eds). Aquatic exercise for rehabilitation and training. Human Kinetics. .Dull, H. 2008. Watsu: freeing the body in water, 4th edition. Watsu Publishing. .  History and origins  In the early 1980s Harold Dull adapted Zen Shiatsu for use in warm water pools at Harbin Hot Springs in northern California, with emphasis on connecting with the breathing patterns of the receiver and establishing a meditative state during sessions. Dull observed that people receiving Watsu treatments entered a deep relaxation state, with strong physical and emotional effects. In the early years, massage therapists were the main practitioners of Watsu, offering sessions as a new category of aquatic therapy called aquatic bodywork. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, physical therapists and other healthcare providers began applying Watsu to treat diverse orthopedic and neurologic conditions. While Watsu's roots in Shiatsu and the close physical contact led to some early resistance among those trained in conventional healthcare, Watsu is now practiced in spas, clinics, and hospitals, and utilized as an aquatic rehabilitation technique.  Technique  Watsu is performed in one-on-one pool sessions in chest-deep warm water. During a session, a provider (practitioner or therapist) gently cradles, moves, stretches, and massages a receiver (client or patient). A typical session consists of a progression of breath coordination, movement patterns in different positions, and massage. Movement patterns including gentle cradling and rocking, more dynamic stretching and mobilization, stillness, and specific mobilization techniques focused on the needs or condition of the receiver. A session may last anywhere from a few minutes to longer than an hour. During a session, the provider continually monitors the state of the receiver, mindful of subtle changes in muscle tension and respiration, and responsive to adapt the treatment accordingly. = Opening = Before starting a pool session, the provider meets with the receiver to fill out paperwork, answer questions, review referrals and records, and discuss needs, expectations, and health condition. The receiver is fitted with floats around the upper shins or lower thighs to prevent the legs from sinking. The session starts with the receiver seated or crouched at the pool edge. The provider faces the receiver, coordinates breathing, and then gently draws the receiver into a back floating position called \\"first position\\". = First position techniques = In \\"first position\\", the receiver floats facing upward while the provider supports the receiver's head in the crook of one arm and maintains gentle traction of the spine from the base of the skull (occiput) to the base of the spine (sacrum). The provider gently sways from leg to leg (\\"horse to horse stance\\") or forcefully moves in deep lunges in alternating directions (\\"warrior to warrior stance\\"), producing rocking and wave patterns in the receiver. Typical Watsu moves use turbulent drag to produce traction and softly stretch the limbs and torso. Movements include slow rocking, arm and leg stretches, trunk rotations and stretches, and various oscillation and pulsing patterns. Moves are repeated on both sides for balance. Basic Watsu moves include the following: * Water Breath Dance – stillness and gentle motion coordinated with up and down shifts in buoyancy as the receiver breathes; * Slow Offering – gentle pulling alternately headward by the base of the skull (occiput) and footward by the base of the spine (sacrum), to produce traction of the spine along with centripetal side force; * Free Spine – gentle oscillation of the spine; * One Leg Offering – gentle pulling alternately headward by the base of the skull (occiput) and footward by one leg, to produce a complex pattern of turbulent drag, with leg, torso, and spine stretches; * Two Leg Offering – gentle pulling alternately headward by the base of the skull (occiput) and footward by both legs, to produce a complex pattern of turbulent drag, with leg, torso, and spine stretches; * Accordion – drawing both knees toward and away from the chest in coordination with the breath, while maintaining neck traction; * Rotating Accordion – adding a spiraling rotation to the accordion action of moving both knees toward and away from the chest, while maintaining support of the occiput and allowing the head more freedom to roll; * Near Leg Rotation – opening and closing the near leg toward and away from the chest to produce an oscillating spine and hip rotation; * Far Leg Rotation – opening and closing the far leg toward and away from the chest to produce an oscillating spine and hip rotation. = Other positions and techniques = Other positions and techniques have been developed to produce specific effects and to address specific parts of the body. For example, a \\"head pull\\" permits gentle traction and mobilization of the neck, \\"seaweed position\\" permits mobilization and rotation of the spine and hips, and \\"full saddle\\" permits stretching and massage of the side body and limbs. = Adapting Watsu for special needs = A specialized set of techniques have been developed to adapt Watsu for receivers with special needs. For clients with severe spasticity, the usual turbulent drag is not sufficient to stretch the body. Additional manual pressure is applied to sustain gentle, prolonged stretches, for example attaining trunk rotation by pressing the opposite shoulder while pulling the knees. Head pillows and other additional floats are often used for specific therapeutic techniques, similar to how rings or floats are used for the Bad Ragaz Ring Method for aquatic rehabilitation. Schoedinger P. 2008. Adapting Watsu for special needs. pp 117-131. Chapter 10 In: Dull H. Watsu: freeing the body in water, 4th edition. Watsu Publishing. .  Training and certification  The Worldwide Aquatic Bodywork Association (WABA) oversees training programs for certification in Watsu and related aquatic bodywork forms (WaterDance, Healing Dance, Aquatic Integration...). WABA also maintains an official registry of certified practitioners and instructors, classes, and training institutes. Training consists of basic and advanced coursework, as well as logged practice and demonstration of mastery. Certification levels include \\"Provider\\", \\"Practitioner\\", \\"Therapist\\", \\"Assistant\\", and \\"Instructor\\".  Health effects = Physiological effects = During a Watsu session, the recipient's heart and respiration rates decrease, depth of respiration increases, muscle tone decreases, and recipients report a deep state of relaxation. Robert Scaer suggested that deep relaxation of Watsu balances the autonomic nervous system (ANS), decreasing sympathetic response and increasing parasympathetic response, with far-reaching benefits. Compressive forces of hydrostatic pressure combine with deep relaxation to enhance functioning of the lymphatic system and reduce swelling in cases of edema. For orthopedic impairments, combined effects of relaxation, warm water, and gentle movement decreases muscle spasm, provides pain relief, improves soft tissue mobility, and increases range of motion. The rhythmic rocking motions combined with repeated trunk rotation and elongation relaxes muscles and improves mobility.Scaer R. 2014. The body bears the burden: trauma, dissociation, and disease, third edition. Routledge. . = Psychological effects = Many patients and clinicians report psychological benefits for stress reduction and resolving past traumas.  Applications  Watsu is offered along with other forms for bodywork and massage at spas, recreation facilities, and retreat centers, and offered as a form of aquatic therapy at clinics, hospitals, and healthcare centers. = General use = For healthy people, Watsu is used for relaxation, muscle stretching, and \\"nurturing connection\\". = Orthopedic and neurologic rehabilitation = For physical rehabilitation, Watsu is used by aquatic therapists to improve function and increase quality of life. Watsu has been applied for treatment of patients with orthopedic and neurologic impairment, in particular for limitations in range of motion from soft tissue restrictions, muscle spasm (hypertonicity), and pain. By improving soft tissue mobility and decreasing spasm, patients can respond better to functional activities. For severe cases, short periods of Watsu can be alternated with short periods of functional activities.Dougherty L, Dunlap E, and Mehler S. 2008. The rehabilitative benefits of Watsu. pp 108-116. Chapter 9 In: Dull, H. Watsu: freeing the body in water, 4th edition. Watsu Publishing. . Watsu has been proposed as a therapy for fibromyalgia syndrome,Faull, K. 2005. A pilot study of the comparative effectiveness of two water-based treatments for fibromyalgia syndrome: Watsu and Aix massage. Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies 9(3):202–210. and for rehabilitating patients after a stroke.Con SC, Duck, WO, and Shim, JH. 2005. Watsu approach for improving spasticity and ambulatory function in hemiparetic patients with stroke. Physiotherapy Research International 14(2):128–136. Little research has been done on Watsu. Various extrapolations concerning therapeutic effects have been made from research in established areas of therapy, in particular proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) and sensory integration. = Psychological rehabilitation = For psychological rehabilitation, Watsu has been used to improve psychological function by calming the nervous system, enhancing relaxation, increasing body awareness and decreasing general anxiety. Watsu is sometimes recommended as an adjunct therapy to help process trauma, in conjunction with a psychotherapist.  Precautions  As with all aquatic activities, Watsu has inherent risks. The Watsu provider needs to constantly observe and analyze each movement for safety, especially in case of injury or illness where movement could cause harm, e.g., osteoporosis, acute rheumatoid arthritis, and ligamentous instability. Slow and smooth movement, without sudden loading of the joints, is generally advisable. Motion sickness, with dizziness, nausea, or disorientation from excess vestibular system stimulation can occasionally result and therapists are advised to watch for signs of overstimulation.

The First Congregational Church was organized under the sponsorship of the First Congregational Church of Longmont in 1889, less than a decade after E. S. Lyon arrived in the area from Connecticut and bought of land that include the original townsite of Lyons. Construction of the church building, on the northwest corner of 4th and High Streets, began in 1894 and was completed on September 23, 1895. The minister and members of the congregation contributed much of the necessary labor, in addition to money and materials. The principal building material was sandstone that was locally quarried, cut by hand and laid in horizontal courses of irregularly sized blocks. The National Register nomination notes that much of the work on the building was done by master stonecutters with the result that the \\"cutting and fitting [of the stone] is exceptionally well executed.\\" The walls are thick. The facade is asymmetrical with the church's principal door leading into the base of a single tower. The door has a semicircular arch of radiating stone voussoirs. Central to the facade are a pair of windows topped by horizontal stone lintels. A decorative feature of the facade is the large arch of voussoirs which rises above the windows. In the gable is an ocular ventilation opening framed by voussoirs and set with louvres. The tower rises to a stone course at the height of the gable, above which is a louvred chamber with a \\"candle-snuffer\\" roof. For more than ten years after the completion of the building (until a Methodist church was built in town), this was the only church in Lyons. At the time of its National Register listing, the congregation was affiliated with the United Church of Christ, but it no longer identifies itself with that denomination.

It follows actor Jeremy Irons as he investigates the global scale and impact of humanity's modern wasteful consumerism and pollution. The film is a call for urgent action to resolve the issue of existing deposits and drastically reduce our consumption towards sustainable levels and zero waste, but also demonstrates how this is already being achieved successfully in many communities around the world. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 22 May 2012, where it was nominated for the Camera d'Or. In the United States it was released in late 2012, and from 2013 in the UK and other countries. Plot With the participation of Jeremy Irons, the documentary looks at the risks to the food chain and the environment through pollution of our air, land and sea by waste. The film reveals surprising truths about very immediate and potent dangers to human health. It is a global conversation between the film star Jeremy Irons and scientists, politicians and ordinary individuals whose health and livelihoods have been fundamentally affected by waste pollution. It shows how the risks to our survival can easily be averted through sustainable approaches that provide far more employment than the current waste industry. Many sites were visited and filmed, around 11 cities, including: *Sidon in Lebanon; the 40 metre mountain of household rubbish in the city port which is affecting the Eastern Mediterranean. *Yorkshire and Gloucestershire in England; the massive toxic waste mounds, near a school and a future hospital as well as housing. Recent research showed that the clay used under liners, designed to prevent contamination of ground water, actually enhances the leaching process. *Ísafjörður in Iceland; the garbage incinerator Funi (among many in the world like those of Covanta Energy) had filters which stopped working, releasing highly toxic dioxin gas up to 20 times over the safe limit. According to Irons, it \\"showed me how state agencies can so easily be seduced by experts who promise to make their problems go away, but who become conspicuously absent when their promises do not deliver\\". *Grignon and Gilly-sur-Isère near Albertville in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes; the Gilly incinerator was closed following a series of catastrophic dioxin emission readings which caused a scandalous occurrence of cancer among the inhabitants, and their subsequent court fight for justice. *Từ Dũ hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam; health impact of Agent Orange (TCDD), which was used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War, on the people of Vietnam including the impact of toxic chemicals on reproductive outcomes, dioxin induced risk to pregnancies, and women giving birth to grossly deformed babies. It showed the result of large quantities of dioxin on humans. *Wales coastline; action of cleaning the garbage from the sea coast. *Jakarta and Ciliwung river in Indonesia; by the highly polluted river live the numerous poor of society. *Gulf of California; an interview with Charles J. Moore about the Great Pacific garbage patch of plastic, chemical sludge (chemicals like flame retardants, pesticides, herbicides, dioxins among other are often hydrophobic and thus are attracted by the plastic) and other waste which are affecting the sea life, and by the food chain the humans. *Plymouth in England; the microparticles of plastic are affecting shellfish. *Great Cumbrae in Scotland; the microparticles of plastic are affecting crabs, and shrimp (up to 83%). *London Zoo in England; interview with Paul D. Jepson about the biomagnification of the toxins among the sea mammals, for example the Beluga whales at the Saint Lawrence Seaway between Canada and United States. *Ross- on-Wye and London in England; organic stores which raise the issue of food packaging, as well British prison which successfully treats food waste. *San Francisco; it reached 75% diversion or zero waste in 2012, compared to New York City which creates 1.5% of total global waste, while recycling only 11-18% of it in 2012, as well that waste reduction and recycling is \\"ideally suited to the creation of a new and forward-thinking industry that could be profitable and create new jobs\\". Production It was produced by Blenheim Films, and released by First Pond Entertainment (USA). Candida Brady wrote, directed and co-produced (along Titus Ogilvy) the film. Jeremy Irons, Rose Ganguzza and Tom Wesel worked as executive producers, while Tabitha Troughton as associate producer. Garry Waller worked as art director, while Sean Bobbitt was the cinematographer. Brady and Irons discussed various possible topics, and decided on the problem of waste, because \\"despite all the evidence and research available, it is not being seriously faced\\". Irons helped to raise the finance, and persuaded his friend Vangelis to score the music. The director Candida Brady notes they tried to address potential backlash \\"by putting all the science together in one place ... we've got 84 peer-reviewed published studies, so that you couldn't dispute it. I think a lot of the problems that films have had in the past were things that don't stand up when you look a little further\\". To her the most disturbing study was about umbilical cord blood (2009), which \\"found up to 232 man-made industrial compounds and pollutants present in a child before it is even born. Ten out of ten babies were shown to have chlorinated dioxins in their blood\\". Other influential studies and interviews include Dr. Ana Soto (who has researched Bisphenol A in plastic) who \\"explained that toxic chemicals are afforded the same rights as human beings: innocent until proven guilty\\", and Paul Jepson's work at ZSL about the effect of toxic chemicals on cetaceans in the world's seas and oceans for 20 years, finding out that the killer whales are no longer able to reproduce as they carry the biggest toxic burden. It took Brady over two years of research, during which she felt various emotions as she became too close to the subject. She notes that \\"what did become very clear to me, is that it is such a complicated subject, waste almost needs its own worldwide regulatory body because it is too much for most people, and they will have knowledge of one area but not another\\". They persistently tried to interact with the individuals \\"on the other side of the issue\\", but were met with reluctance. In the beginning she wanted to have a \\"bad guy\\" to blame, but soon it became very clear that the issue is so complicated, there is not one person or company, yet the whole of humanity's way of life has got out of control. However, compared to many other environmental documentaries it is very critical of the incinerations and waste-to-energy plants, because it is related to the \\"issue of dioxin pollution – a by-product of incineration, which in high doses can cause a range of health problems including cancer, reproductive difficulties and birth defects\\", and it is not a long-term solution to resolve the issue of global waste production, compared to zero waste approach. The dioxin builds up in the fat of the body, and women are \\"luckier\\" to get rid of it - when women become pregnant some of the dioxin, along other nutrients, goes to the fetus. According to Irons, the director Brady decided to show the footage of jars containing preserved foetuses with birth defects in a hospital in Vietnam because of two reasons; to most people the dioxins, furans, PCBs and other toxic chemicals are all just words, until they see and understand their impact in the human body and on life in general. Secondly as a 2001 BBC Newsnight investigation found that ash from a London incinerator had a similar level of dioxins to Vietnamese soil, after the spraying of Agent Orange. Most incinerator filters are globally only checked between two and four times annually for a few hours at a time, and in the past medical research was generally interested only into the effects of high dosage, whereas recently they have discovered evidence that dioxins are having an effect on foetuses at very, very low doses. It is thought that it could take six generations to \\"breed out\\" genetic damage. Release The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 22 May 2012. In the United States it was released on 14 December 2012. Between 8 April and 7 November 2013, it was released in the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, Japan and Germany. On 16 November 2016, it will be released in France. It was released on DVD, iTunes Store, it can also be bought and rented online from the official website. Reception Trashed has received universal positive acclaim by critics. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 87% of critics gave the film a \\"Fresh\\" rating, based on 15 reviews with an average score of 7/10. Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 71 (out of 100) based on 6 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In The New York Times the review notes \\"if we must talk trash, Mr. Irons — assisted by a scientist or two and Vangelis’s doomy score — is an inspired choice of guide\\", and by the time of the visit to the Vietnamese hospital for children, the \\"plastic water bottle in your hand will feel as dangerous as a Molotov cocktail\\". In the New York Daily News review the film received 5/5 stars; the review concluded that \\"for all the poisonous truths in Trashed, there are also solid grass-roots solutions that, as presented, feel do-able and politically digestible. That helps, because everything Irons finds puts you off food. Crucial viewing for realists and alarmists both\\". The Huffington Post concluded with the reviewer's challenge for \\"any decent human being to see it from start to finish and still think that garbage should be fooled around with in such close proximity to children\\". The Village Voice noted that \\"forcing our attention onto the thing most of us love to forget makes its own point. And indeed it is hard to look at the dumps, heaps, toxic seepages, and ocean-polluting plastics shown here to be neither as distant nor as containable as one might hope\\". The Variety review concluded that \\"the pic delivers a judicious mix of human interest and useful statistics that will make it accessible to middle-class auds, especially at green-tinged fests and on upscale broadcasters\\". The Hollywood Reporter's review considered that the Irons mission placed \\"him closer to, say, Nick Broomfield\\", \\"Brady's script has a playschool-simple four-part structure, examining the three main methods of trash-disposal -- landfill, incineration and sea-dumping\\", while \\"digital cinematography by Sean Bobbitt present a range of disturbing images with unblinking clarity -- and eventually any grounds for optimism become dispiritingly elusive\\". However, it \\"doesn't present itself as a rounded exploration of the issues it analyzes\\", with \\"anyone who disagrees with its basic theses are non-existent, and we never really get to the bottom of who's to blame\\". In the Los Angeles Times is also noted that although \\"scientists, doctors and academics weigh in as well, though flipside input from corporate interests and government policymakers would have added welcome dimension to this crucial discussion\\". The Empire review gave the film 3/5 stars, considering that \\"despite offering some sensible solutions, the scale and style are too small-screen for mass conversion\\". The Sabotage Times review concluded that \\"Trashed is a documentary that needs to be seen, that needs to enter the mainstream. Because we're (still) trashing the planet. We've heard this enough to stop thinking about the implications, to start humming to what's become white noise - but Trashed rearticulates the message, volunteering a not just inconvenient but downright harrowing set of truths\\". =Awards= In 2012 it won the \\"Special Jury Prize\\" in the \\"Earth Grand Prix\\" category at the Tokyo International Film Festival, \\"Audience Award - Movies that Matter\\" at the Maui Film Festival, and was nominated for the Caméra d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2013 it won the \\"Special Documentary Award\\" at the 30th International Environmental Film Festival (FIFE) held in Paris, \\"Grand Prix Winner\\" at the Kyiv International Documentary Film Festival, \\"Palme Verte\\" at the UK Green Film Festival, \\"Award of Excellence\\" and \\"Best Editing\\" at the movie awards in Los Angeles, and \\"Special Mention\\" at the CinemaAmbiente Festival. In 2014 it won the \\"Earth Award\\" at the 5th Cinema Verde Environmental Film and Arts Festival. Impact Irons noted that the \\"state and federal government should provide legislation which designs a waste management policy right across the country ... that most people would like to cooperate in reducing waste, but to encourage them the national policy should be clear, well advertised and consistent\\". Asked what people should do he advised them to research if there is waste-to-energy plant planned in their area and oppose it, while if there is not to discover how the local policy deals with waste. To lobby MP for legislation to cut waste, regulate the production, particularly of toxic plastics, and packaging. To remove all packaging at the point of purchase, thus pushing the problem towards the manufacturers, as well reducing waste both at home and in their workplace. The film helped to promote, and was also integrated into, Zero Waste initiatives across the world. For example during the screeing in Italy in 2013 it was joined by Zero Waste Italy, ANPAS, municipality Greve in Chianti among others, it promoted the book by Paul Connett, and spread the notice that over 119 Italian municipalities had adopted the Zero Waste program. In 2014, the Italian TV channel Rai 3 made a synthesis about the film. Many people in Singapore decided to join the Zero Waste program after they watched the film. =Screenings= Since the release it has been shown in over 40 countries, as well as at the UK Houses of Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament, the House of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament, the French National Assembly, the New York Mayor's Office. In November 2013 in Jakarta the film was seen by then Governor and current President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, and the former President Megawati Sukarnoputri among other policy makers. Earth Hour Communities in 31 Indonesian cities were reached for the screening of the documentary. In 2015, Irons presented the film at the University College Cork in Ireland.

The tour supported Timberlake's third studio album, The 20/20 Experience (2013) and Jay Z's twelfth studio album, Magna Carta Holy Grail (2013). Overall, the duo performed to 622,559 fans in two countries, grossing a total of US$75.3 million. With the 14 dates sold-out, it was the 15th highest-grossing tour of 2013.  Background  After a six-year musical hiatus, on January 14, 2013, Timberlake released \\"Suit & Tie\\", the lead single from the singer's third studio album, The 20/20 Experience which featured American rapper Jay-Z. Prior the 2013 Grammy Awards ceremony, Ryan Seacrest interviewed Timberlake and teased him about a possible joint tour with another artist. On that Timberlake responded, \\"We are still putting it together, but it's gonna be a lot of fun. I don't know how much I should say.\\" During the award ceremony, Timberlake was joined by Jay-Z at the stage for the performance of \\"Suit & Tie\\". Following their appearance on Grammys, rumors of a stadium tour between the artists were raised as a result of Jay-Z's posts on his Life + Times blog; he posted series of venues with the note \\"#LegendsOfSummer this week\\". The Legends of the Summer tour was officially announced on February 22, 2013, when North American dates were revealed. The show started on July 17, 2013 in Toronto, Canada. The tickets for the show went on sale on February 28, with the pre-sale starting on February 27. Citi cardmembers had access to pre-sale tickets beginning on Friday, February 22, at 12 noon local time through Citi's Private Pass Program. On July 14, 2013, Timberlake and Jay-Z performed at the Olympic Park in London, United Kingdom as part of the Wireless Festival for a \\"special preview\\" of the tour.

His past concerts have so many dancers bounding this way and that, and him joining them, that it's distracting and takes away from his significant talents: his ability to deliver his soulful and grinding pop tunes as the frontman of an expert band and highlight his own musicianship, playing upright piano, keyboards and electric and acoustic guitar— which he did on some of his songs and some of Jay Z's.\\"  Set list  The following set list is representative of the show on July 28, 2013.

Cobmoosa (1768 - 1866), or Weebmossa meaning \\"Great Walker\\", was an Odawa leader who lived in a Native American village at the mouth of the Flat River at the present-day city of Lowell, Michigan until 1858. From the mid-1830s, there was a wave of white people wanting to settle in Michigan. At that time, much of the land was the ancestral homeland of several Native American tribes. The federal government negotiated with the state's tribal leaders beginning in 1836, but were unable to secure a viable treaty to relocate them. Cobmoosa was one of 54 Odawa and Chippewa leaders involved in the successful negotiations of the 1855 Treaty of Detroit, where Odawa and Chippewa people stayed in Michigan, rather than relocating to Kansas as the government had negotiated with some, but not all, of the leaders in 1836. As a result of the 1855 treaty, Cobmoosa's tribe relocated from its ancestral lands to Elbridge Township in Oceana County, Michigan. There was compensation for the tribal chiefs and headmen, but most of the approximately $540,000 in cash and goods went to white \\"friends\\" involved in the negotiation process. Cobmoosa lived 98 years and spent his last years in a log cabin that had been built by the government along Cobmoosa Lake. He was known for his eloquence and majestic walk and manner. The poem Cobmoosa's Lament was written in his memory, the town of Cobmoosa was named for him, and a stone monument was erected in his honor in Hart, Michigan. Early and family life Cobmoosa was born in 1768 at a Rapids of Grand River village. He is believed to be the son of Antoine Campau and his wife, who was said to have been the daughter of an Odawa chief. Cobmoosa said of his father, a Frenchman from Montreal named Antoine, \\"At an early period of the Revolution my father espoused the cause of liberty with the Americans and remained firm to the end.\\" He grew into a tall man, with \\"long strides.\\" He had four to six wives, three of whom were the daughters of Chief Wobwindego. Cobmoosa had three daughters: Ne-gance, Mrs. Cub-as-ka and Mrs. Ne-gak. His sons were Henry, Antoine, and James. Ojibwe chief Flat River, a tributary of the Grand River. Cobmoosa's ancestral home was near the mouth of Flat River on land that is now Lowell, Michigan Cobmoosa was well-respected among the natives of the Grand River Valley and was generally known for his eloquence and majestic presence. He lived in an Odawa village near the mouth of the Flat River, where the current town of Lowell, Michigan is located. Cobmoosa was the second-in-command of the Flat River bands of Native Americans in 1833. That year, the village of Ionia was founded by 63 people from Eastern New York and needed a place to live while they built their log cabins. Cobmoosa's village moved about three miles away to another place along the river and the newcomers took over Cobmoosa's village after they bought the tribe's wigwams. Merchant Cobmoosa operated a trading post at the mouth of the Flat River. Over time, he came to be known as a man of \\"sterling character\\" and \\"great dignity\\". Cobmoosa moved into a house in Lowell, where he lived with his wife, Sophia. On Main Street, he operated a grocery store. Treaty of 1855 More white settlers moved into the area over the next several years and there was pressure to make a treaty for Native American land. Cobmoosa was among those who went with 24 Ottawa and Chippewa leaders to Washington, D.C. to negotiate a treaty with the president. The federal government wanted the tribes to relinquish all land north of the Grand River. He attended the negotiations, but was not one of the signers of the treaty. The treaty of 1836 was not abided once the tribes learned that they were required to relocate to Kansas, which was a problem due to the distance and change in habitat. The treaty then was renegotiated for members of the Ottawa and Chippewa tribes to relocate to Oceana and Mason Counties in Michigan. In 1855, Cobmoosa signed the Treaty of Detroit with the federal government which meant that his tribe would relocate to Oceana County, Michigan. The treaty was signed by 54 other leaders of Odawa and Chippewa tribes in Detroit. In exchange for their ancestral lands, roughly $540,000 in cash and goods were split among all of the represented tribes. It was to be paid out over 10 years. Much of it went to white friends, like Louis Campau; $500 went to the chiefs and $100 to headmen. Cobmoosa's people relocated to Elbridge Township. The government built a log cabin for him in Cobmoosa, Michigan and he along with 1300 others were relocated by 1858. Reluctant to move to the reservation in Elbridge Township, Michigan, he waited until all of the tribe had relocated and stayed near the graves of his forefathers as long as he could. He did, though, make trips to Oceana County to be with members of his tribe. Later years and death Cobmoosa's cabin was located on 80 acres allotted to him in Oceana County along Cobmoosa Lake, about three miles west of the Cobmoosa post office. He lived at his cabin with one of this daughters and her husband, Joe Bailey. He also lived part of the time with another daughter Wassia and her husband Jerome Ne-gake, who had a farm across the lake from his cabin. He died at 98 years of age in 1866 and was buried in Elbridge Township, Michigan on a knoll near his cabin. A monument was erected to Cobmoosa at the location of the initial schoolhouse that had been built by the government. The Daughters of the American Revolution's Ionia chapter had the monument created with the inscription: \\"Ottawa Indian Chief and Great Speaker of the Tribe. Born at the Rapids of the Grand River, 1768. Died on this reservation, 1866.\\" Legacy Cobmoosa's Lament was written in memory of the chief by Alden Jewell of Grand Rapids. It was published in an article by Lewis Bates in 1854 in the Grand Rapids Eagle. The \\"Cobmoosa Stone\\", a stone monument in his honor at Hart, Michigan, was dedicated by the Daughters of the American Revolution's Ionia chapter in 1927. He was recognized in part for his role in the Treaty of Detroit of 1855 that required the Odawa people to move to Mason and Oceana counties of Michigan. A commemorative monument was erected at the Ionia Fairgrounds by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1922. The plaque says that Cobmoosa's band lived in a seasonal village near the present town of Ionia.

On July 18, 2013, the Senate confirmed McCarthy as the 13th Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency by a vote of 59-40, largely along party lines. On September 11, 2015, 26 U.S. representatives introduced a resolution impeaching McCarthy. It was referred to the House Judiciary Committee and died. Tenure Administrator Gina McCarthy at Portage Lake Glacier, Alaska, August 26, 2013 On May 27, 2015, McCarthy finalized a rule under the Clean Water Act which proposed a new detailed and inclusive definition of \\"waters of the United States\\". Thirteen states sued, and U.S. Chief District Judge Ralph R. Erickson issued an injunction blocking the regulation in those states. In a separate lawsuit, on October 9, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit Judge David McKeague, joined by Judge Richard Allen Griffin stayed the rule's application nationwide; judge Damon Keith dissented. Congress passed a joint resolution under the Congressional Review Act overturning the \\"WOTUS\\" rule,, 114th Congress (2015). but President Obama vetoed the measure. On June 25, 2015, McCarthy finalized the Clean Power Plan under the Clean Air Act, seeking to reduce coal use pursuant to the Paris Agreement.Recent Regulation: The Clean Power Plan, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 1152 (February 10, 2016). Challengers failed to get the regulation stayed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, but on February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States voted 5-4 to grant the stay, the first time the Supreme Court had ever stayed a regulation prior to lower court review. On March 17, 2016, McCarthy and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform regarding the Flint water crisis. Snyder apologized for the state's mistakes. McCarthy, however, insisted the EPA had done nothing wrong and that \\"there is no way my agency created this problem\\", causing her to at times be shouted down by outraged members of Congress. In October 2016, the EPA's inspector general concluded that the EPA had wrongfully delayed issuing an emergency order regarding Flint, Michigan. =Pegasus Capital= In 2017, McCarthy joined Pegasus Capital Advisors, a private equity firm, where she serves as an operating advisor focused on sustainability and wellness investments. =Harvard C-CHANGE director= In late May 2018, Harvard T.H. School of Public Health announced the formation of a new climate and health science center - The Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard Chan School(Harvard C-CHANGE) - with McCarthy as its director. As of January 2020 McCarthy became the Chair, Board of Advisors, of Harvard C-CHANGE. The center increases public awareness of the health impacts of climate change and uses science to make it personal, actionable, and urgent. Now led by Dr. Aaron Bernstein, Interim Director, the Center leverages Harvard’s cutting-edge research to inform policies, technologies, and products that reduce air pollution and other causes of climate change. By making climate change personal, highlighting solutions, and emphasizing the important role we all play in driving change, Harvard C-CHANGE puts health outcomes at the center of climate actions. =Natural Resources Defense Council= In November 2019 McCarthy was appointed president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, effective early 2020.

His origin and parentage is obscure. He is only mentioned in the sources as leading the defence of Nicaea in 978 against the rebel Bardas Skleros, and as an imperial envoy to him 11 years later. He had three children, late in life. The eldest, Isaac, became emperor in 1057–1059, and the youngest, John, was the progenitor of the Komnenian dynasty as the father of Alexios I Komnenos.  Biography  Nothing is known of Manuel's early life. From the fact that he was militarily active in 978, and given that he was able to have children as late as , a date of birth of has been suggested and generally accepted by modern scholars. His parents' identity is obscure: as Manuel's own firstborn son was named Isaac (Isaakios), the Greek scholar Konstantinos Varzos considered it likely that his father had the same name, since according to Greek custom the eldest male child is named after its paternal grandfather. Nothing is known otherwise about his life and career. According to Varzos, Manuel inherited his surname of \\"Komnenos\\" from his father, while his equally obscure mother was an unnamed lady of the Erotikos family, possibly related to the 11th-century rebel Theophilos Erotikos. The French scholar Jean-Claude Cheynet, on the other hand, proposed that Manuel was a member of the Erotikos family, and that he was the first to have changed the surname to Komnenos. Modern scholarship commonly accepts Michael Psellos' comment that the family originated from the village of Komne in Thrace. Varzos also considers Manuel a brother of the protospatharios Nikephoros Komnenos, who was named governor of the Armenian region of Vaspurakan soon after its annexation in 1021, but although possible, such a relationship cannot be proven. Manuel is mentioned for the first time in 978, when he led the defence of Nicaea against the rebel general Bardas Skleros, who had risen up against Emperor Basil II (). Although his great-granddaughter, the princess Anna Komnene, claims in her Alexiad that he had been named strategos autokrator (commander-in-chief) of the East and sent with full powers to deal with the revolt, it is far more likely that he was merely a local commander. Manuel maintained the city's defence with some success, even though the besiegers managed to undermine and collapse one of its towers, until the lack of food became acute. At that point Manuel was able to fool Skleros, by pretending that he had mountains of wheat and was considering joining him, into allowing him and the inhabitants to depart freely for Constantinople. Manuel re-appears in 989, when he was sent as an envoy to Skleros, who had once more risen in revolt against Basil II, to persuade him to surrender. Manuel was successful in his task, and the elderly rebel ended his revolt and gave himself up on 11 October. The titles by which he is recorded were patrikios, anthypatos, and vestes. Manuel owned lands in the region of modern Kastamonu in Paphlagonia, inherited after his death by his eldest son, and which became the stronghold of the family in the 11th century. Manuel Erotikos Komnenos died probably around 1020. At that time, his children were still young, so he entrusted them to the care of Emperor Basil II.  Family  Manuel's wife is virtually unknown. She was likely named Maria, as were two of her granddaughters, and probably died . They had two sons and one daughter: # Isaac I Komnenos ( – 1061), married Catherine of Bulgaria, daughter of the last Bulgarian Tsar, and a distinguished general. He became emperor in 1057 at the head of a cabal of Anatolian generals, but resigned in 1059 and retired to a monastery. # an unnamed daughter (born ), married Michael Dokeianos, who served as Catepan of Italy and was killed by the Pechenegs in 1050. #John Komnenos ( – 12 July 1067), married Anna Dalassene, and served during his brother's reign as Domestic of the Schools. He fathered several children who also became senior military leaders. His third son, Alexios I Komnenos, became emperor in 1081, founding the Komnenian dynasty.

The largest contingents are from Eastern and Western Europe (103) the United States (100), Australia (50) and the United Kingdom (44). Members come from a wide range of professions including academicians, organization consultants, psychoanalysts, psychiatrists, psychologists and human resource professionals. The Society seeks to help establish and sustain a community of thinkers and practitioners who share an interest in examining organizations from a psychoanalytic perspective. It helps scholars and practitioners from different disciplines, countries and with varying political persuasions to develop and communicate ideas, including those focused on applying research and theory to practice. It provides a public forum for discussing, presenting and distributing papers that explore the field of the psychoanalytic organizational studies.http://ispso.wdfiles.com/local-- files/nav%3Aispso/ISPSO%20Handbook%20Feb%202013.pdf Activities The Society holds an annual week-long meeting with four days dedicated to workshops focused on professional development and three days dedicated to a symposium for the presentation and discussion of scholarly papers. Each annual meeting is sponsored by members in a particular country, and is organized around particular theme. In addition, members from Australia, Europe, the United States and South America hold regional meetings to consider a particular theme or issue. The Society’s Annual Meeting has been held in Helsingør, Jerusalem, London, Melbourne, Paris, Philadelphia and Stockholm, among other cities. Conference themes have been “Motivation and Meaning at Work,” “The Dark Side of Competition: Psychoanalytic Insights,” Power, Politics, Destructiveness and “Creativity in Organizations: A Psychoanalytic Perspective.” Members and non members submit abstracts for papers they wish to present at the symposium. The organizing committee selects some number of these abstracts for presentation as full papers at the symposium itself. Papers typically cover a wide range of topics. Many of the papers presented at the symposiums are based on case studies of consultations to businesses and not for profit organizations. These symposia, while organized as traditional academic conferences, have two unusual features. Each morning symposium members can participate in a “social dreaming matrix” and in the afternoon, in a summative reflection on learnings of the day. Both the morning and afternoon activities enact the Society’s belief that groups can facilitate individual learning, through self-reflection and by eliciting people’s unconsciously coded responses to the themes, issues and events of a particular setting. Scholarship Many of the papers presented at the symposiums have been published in academic journals and books. Several books, published by Karnac Press, draw on papers presented at the symposiums as well as the work and writing of individual members. Examples are, Psychoanalytic Studies of Organizations: Contributions from the International Society for the Psychoanalytic Study of Organizations Burkard Sievers, et al, eds., Psychoanalytic Studies of Organizations: Contributions from the International Society for the Psychoanalytic Study of Organizations, London: Karnac Books, 2009 and Psychoanalytic Reflections in a Changing World. Psychoanalytic Reflections in a Changing World, Halina Bruning, ed., London: Karnac Books, 2012 Members have contributed to the academic journal Organizational and Social Dynamics, edited by members of OPUS, (the Organization for Promoting the Understanding of Society),http://www.opus.org.uk/ which focuses on the links between a psychoanalytic understanding and social issues, as well as to the journal Socioanalysis published in Melbourne. ISPSO has a growing online library of abstracts and full articles from symposia and other sources Some of this material is restricted to members, but much of it is available freely to anyone.

She was regarded as a major poet during her life and William Thomas Stead called her \\"the Browning of American poetry\\". Early life Branch was born at Hempsted House in New London, Connecticut in 1875, the younger child of John Locke Branch, a lawyer, and Mary Lydia Bolles Branch (1840–1922), a children's author and poet who was part of Hempstead family, who had lived in the area since 1640 and owned some of the oldest houses in southeast Connecticut. Education Branch spent most of her school years in New York and Brooklyn where she studied at Froebel and Adelphi Academies and then Smith College, due to her father's law practice being in that area.Brookhart, Mary Hughes, \\"Branch, Anna Hempstead\\"; http://www.anb.org/articles/16/16-01901.html; American National Biography Online Feb. 2000. Branch graduated from Smith College in 1897 and went on to study dramaturgy at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1900. In 1898, the year after her graduation, her poem \\"The Road 'Twixt Heaven and Hell\\" was selected as the year's best verse by a college graduate by Century Magazine. After her recognition, Branch went on to become a habitual published writer in various national magazines and was published for the first time by Houghton Mifflin in 1901 Branch's reputation was made with her next two collections, both heavily influenced by the work of the Pre-Raphaelites, especially Christina Rossetti. The Shoes That Danced (1905) features odd settings and characters. Rose of the Wind (1910) contains \\"The Wedding Feast\\", a reworking of \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and her most famous single poem, \\"Nimrod\\", a blank verse epic about the ancient king. The title work, a dramatic poem, was staged at the Empire Theatre in 1908. Sonnets from a Lock Box (1929) is regarded as her best work. It is a collection of thirty-eight sonnets using the first person, noted for its directness and mystical symbolism. Her final collection of poetry, Last Poems (1944), was published posthumously by Ridgely Torrence. Branch was also the author of A Christmas Miracle and God Bless this House (1925) and Bubble Blower's House (1926). Branch was also known for her philanthropy, mostly centered around Christodora House, a settlement house in New York City. There she created the Poet's Guild, whose members, including Edwin Arlington Robinson, William Rose Benét, Percy MacKaye, and Margaret Widdemer, taught classes at the house. Branch was also vice president of the Poetry Society of America. Later life In 1918 she served as the vice president of the National League for Women's Service and chaired the education and festival committees in the War Camp Community Service. She founded and directed the Poets' Guild of Christodora House which thrived due to her assiduous attention and ability to enlist the participation of an impressive array of fellow poets.

They do this by making the intermediate host, where they may reproduce asexually, more likely to be eaten by a predator at a higher trophic level which becomes the definitive host where the parasite reproduces sexually; the mechanism is therefore sometimes called parasite increased trophic facilitation or parasite increased trophic transmission. Examples can be found in bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and animals. Parasites may also alter the host behaviour to increase the protection to the parasites or their offspring. The term bodyguard manipulation is used for such mechanisms. Among the behavioral changes caused by parasites is carelessness, making their hosts easier prey.Moore, J. (2002). Parasites and the behavior of animals. Oxford: Oxford University Press. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, for example, infects small rodents and causes them to become careless and attracted to the smell of feline urine, which increases their risk of predation and the parasite's chance of infecting a cat, its definitive host. Parasites may alter the host's behavior by infecting the host's central nervous system, or by altering its neurochemical communication, studied in neuro-parasitology. Behavioral change=Types= Parasite manipulations can be either direct or indirect. Indirect manipulation is the most frequent method used by behavior-altering parasites, while the direct approach is far less common. Direct manipulation is when the parasite itself affects the host and induces a behavioral response, for example by creating neuroactive compounds that stimulate a response in the host's central nervous system (CNS), a method mostly practiced by parasites that reside within the CNS. Affecting the host's neural system is complicated and manipulation includes initiating immune cascades in the host. However, determination of the causative factor is difficult, especially whether the behavioral change is the result of direct manipulation from the parasite, or an indirect response of the host's immune system. A direct approach to behavioral manipulation is often very costly for the parasite, which results in a trade-off between the benefits of the manipulation (e.g., fitness increase) and the energy it costs. The more common approach for parasites is to indirectly induce behavioral responses by interacting with the host's immune system to create the necessary neuroactive compounds to induce a desired behavioral response. Parasites can also indirectly affect the behavior of their hosts by disturbing their metabolism, development or immunity. Parasitic castrators drastically modify their hosts' metabolism and reproduction, sometimes by secreting castrating hormones, changing their behavior and physiology to benefit the parasite. Parasites may alter hosts' behaviors in ways that increase their likelihood of transmission (e.g. by the host being ingested by a predator); result in the parasite's release at appropriate sites (e.g. by changes in the host's preferences for habitats); increase parasite survival or increase the host's likelihood of being infected with more parasites. =By viruses= Rabies causes the host to be aggressive and prone to biting others. This along with increased salivation, which carries the virus, increases the chances of it spreading to new hosts. At the same time hydrophobia (fear of water) prevents the host from drinking, which would wash virus-laden saliva down into the stomach making it unavailable for infection by biting. Viruses from the family Baculoviridae induce in their hosts changes to both feeding behavior and environment selection. They infect moth and butterfly caterpillars, who some time following infection begin to eat incessantly, providing nutrients for the virus's replication. When the virions (virus \\"units\\") are ready to leave the host, the caterpillar climbs higher and higher, until its cells are made to secrete enzymes that \\"dissolve the animal into goo\\", raining down clumps of tissue and viral material for ingestion by future hosts. =By protozoa= The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii infects animals from the family Felidae (its definitive host), and its oocysts are shed with the host's feces. When a rodent consumes the fecal matter it gets infected with the parasite (becoming its intermediate host). The rodent subsequently becomes more extroverted and less fearful of cats, increasing its chance of predation and the parasite's chance of completing its lifecycle. There is some evidence that T. gondii, when infecting humans, alters their behavior in similar ways to rodents; it has also been linked to cases of schizophrenia. Other parasites that increase their host's risk of predation include Euhaplorchis californiensis, Dicrocoelium dendriticum, Myrmeconema neotropicum and Diplostomum pseudospathaceum. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, carried by the Anopheles gambiae mosquito, changes its host's attraction to sources of nectar in order to increase its sugar intake and enhance the parasite's chance of survival. It also decreases the host's attraction to human blood while gestating, only to increase it when it is ready to transmit to a human host. =By helminths= horsehair worm shortly after emerging from its cricket host, now drowned Making the host careless increases the risk of it being eaten by a non-host predator, interrupting the parasite's life-cycle. Some parasites manipulate their intermediate host to reduce this risk. For example, the parasitic trematode Microphallus sp., uses the snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum as an intermediate host. The parasite manipulates the snail's foraging behavior to increase the chance of it being preyed upon by the parasite's definitive hosts (waterfowl). The infected snail forages on the upper side of rocks during the period of the day when waterfowl feed most intensely. During the rest of the day, the snail forages at the bottom of rocks to reduce the risk of being eaten by fish (non-hosts for the parasitic trematode). The lancet liver fluke (Dicrocoelium dendriticum) is a parasitic trematode with a complex life cycle. In its adult state it occurs in the liver of its definitive host (ruminants), where it reproduces. The parasite eggs are passed with the feces of the host, which then are eaten by a terrestrial snail (first intermediate host). The fluke matures into a juvenile stage in the snail, which in an attempt to protect itself excretes the parasites in \\"slime- balls\\". The \\"slime-balls\\" are then consumed by ants (second intermediate hosts). The fluke manipulates the ant to move up to the top of grass, where they have a higher chance of being eaten by grazing ruminants. The parasitic nematode Myrmeconema neotropicum infects the intermediate ant host Cephalotes atratus. The nematode then induces a morphological change in the ant, which turns the gaster color from black to red, making it resemble fruit. This color transition makes the ant susceptible to predation by frugivorous birds, which act as the parasite's definitive hosts. The parasitic eggs are deposited in the bird's feces and are eaten by ants, which complete the cycle. Snail with its left eye stalk parasitized by Leucochloridium paradoxum Crickets infected by horsehair worms exhibit light-seeking behavior and increased walking speed, leading them to open spaces and ponds (the surface of which reflects moonlight); the crickets will eventually find and enter a body of water, where the worm will wiggle out of the cricket's abdomen and swim away. While crickets often drown in the process, those who survive exhibit a partial recovery and return to normal activities in as little as 20 hours. The trematode Leucochloridium paradoxum matures inside snails of the genus Succinea. When ready to switch to its definitive host, a bird, the parasite travels to the eye stalks of its host and begins to pulsate, attracting birds with its striking resemblance to an insect larva. It also influences the normally nocturnal snail to climb out into the open during the day for an increased chance of being consumed by a bird. Schistocephalus solidus is a parasitic tapeworm with three different hosts, two intermediate and one definitive. In its adult stage the tapeworm resides in the intestine of piscivorous birds, where they reproduce and release eggs through the bird's feces. Free-swimming larvae hatch from the eggs, which are in turn ingested by copepods (the first intermediate host). The parasite grows and develops in the crustacean into a stage that can infect the second intermediate host, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). The parasite's definitive host, a bird, then consumes the infected three-spined stickleback and the cycle is complete. It has been observed that S. solidus alters the behavior of the fish in a manner that impedes its escape response when faced with a predatorial bird. This parasite-induced behavioral manipulation effectively increases the chance of it being consumed by its definitive bird host. It has also been observed that the parasite does not induce this behavior until it has reached a developed stage that can survive in the host bird and therefore effectively reduce its own mortality rate, due to premature transmission. =By insects= Emerald cockroach wasp \\"walking\\" a paralyzed cockroach to its burrow The emerald cockroach wasp (Ampulex compressa) parasitises its host, the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) as a food source and for its growing larvae. The wasp stings the cockroach twice: First in the thoracic ganglion, paralyzing its front legs and enabling the wasp to deliver a second, more difficult sting, directly into the cockroach's brain; this second sting makes the cockroach groom itself excessively before sinking into a state of hypokinesia – \\"a... lethargy characterized by lack of spontaneous movement or response to external stimuli\\".. The wasp then pulls the idle cockroach into its burrow, where it deposits an egg onto its abdomen and buries it for the growing larva to feed on. Keeping the cockroach in a hypokinetic state at this stage, rather than simply killing it, allows it to stay \\"fresh\\" for longer for the larva to feed on. The adult wasp emerges after 6 weeks, leaving behind nothing but an empty cockroach \\"shell\\". The parasitic wasp Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga grows its larvae on spiders of the species Leucauge argyra. Shortly before killing its host the larva injects it with a chemical that changes its weaving behavior, causing it to weave a strong, cocoon-like structure. The larva then kills the spider and enters the cocoon to pupate. Ladybug guarding a Dinocampus coccinellae cocoon. The ladybug will remain stationary until the adult wasp emerges from its cocoon, and die some time afterwards The wasp Dinocampus coccinellae is both an endoparasite and ectoparasite of ladybugs. The wasp injects an egg into the beetle's abdomen, where the larva feeds on its haemolymph. When grown and ready to pupate the larva exits its host, which remains immobile, and weaves a cocoon on its underside, where it pupates. Were a predator to approach, the beetle would twitch its limbs, scaring the predator off. This use of the host as a protection has been termed as bodyguard manipulation. Similarly several parasitic wasps induce their spider hosts to build stronger webs to protect the growing parasites. Strepsiptera of the family Myrmecolacidae can cause their ant host to linger on the tips of grass leaves, increasing the chance of being found by the parasite's males (in case of females) and putting them in a good position for male emergence (in case of males). A similar, but much more intricate behavior is exhibited by ants infected with the fungus Ophiocordyceps unilateralis: irregularly-timed body convulsions cause the ant to drop to the forest floor, from which it climbs a plant up to a certain height before locking its jaws into the vein of one of its leaves answering certain criteria of direction, temperature and humidity. After several days the fruiting body of the fungus grows from the ant's head and ruptures, releasing the fungus's spores. Several species of fly in the family Phoridae parasitise fire ants. The fly injects an egg into the ant's thorax; upon hatching, the larva migrates into the ant's head, where it feeds on the ant's haemolymph, muscle and nerve tissue. During this period some larvae direct the ant up to 50 meters away from the nest and towards a moist, leafy place where they can hatch safely. Eventually the larva completely devours the ant's brain, which often falls off (hence the species nickname: \\"decapitating fly\\"). The larva then pupates in the empty head capsule, emerging as an adult fly after two weeks. = By crustaceans = Members of the order Rhizocephala such as S. carcini alter male hosts' hormonal balance, to encourage nurturing behavior similar to that seen in females. The parasite usually spends its entire life within the host; however, if it is removed from the host in a laboratory setting, male hosts will subsequently grow partial or complete female gonads. Evolutionary perspective=Addition of intermediate hosts= For complex life cycles to emerge in parasites, the addition of intermediate host species must be beneficial, e.g., result in a higher fitness. It is probable that most parasites with complex life cycles evolved from simple life cycles. The transfer from simple to complex life cycles has been analyzed theoretically, and it has been shown that trophically transmitted parasites can be favored by the addition of an intermediate prey host if the population density of the intermediate host is higher than that of the definitive host. Additional factors that catalyze this transfer are high predation rates, and a low natural mortality rate of the intermediate host. Parasites with a single host species are faced with the problem of not being able to survive in higher trophic levels and therefore dying with its prey host. The development of complex life cycles is most likely an adaptation of the parasite to survive in the predator. The development of parasite increased trophic transmission is a further adaptation in relation to a complex life cycle, where the parasite increases its transmission to a definitive host by manipulating its intermediate host. =Evolution of induced behaviors= The adaptive manipulation hypothesis posits that specific behavioral alterations induced in a host can be used by parasites to increase their fitness. Under this hypothesis, induced behaviors are the result of natural selection acting upon the parasite's extended phenotype (in this case its host's behavior). Many behaviors induced by obligate parasites to complete their lifecycles are examples of adaptive manipulation because of their clear relationship to parasite fitness. For example, evidence has shown that infection by the parasitic worm Pomphorhynchus laevis leads to altered drifting behavior in its intermediate host, the amphipod Gammarus pulex; this altered behavior increases its host's predation risk by fish which are P. laeviss definitive hosts. The induced behavioral change in the host thus leads to the parasite's increased success in completing its life cycle. In general, whether a specific behavioral change serves an adaptive purpose for the parasite, the host, or both, depends on the entire \\"host-parasite system\\": The life cycle of the pathogen, its virulence and the host's immune response. Conversely, evolved behaviors of the host may be a result of adaptations to parasitism.  Mechanisms  The way in which parasites induce behavioral changes in hosts has been compared to the way a neurobiologist would effect a similar change in a lab. A scientist may stimulate a certain pathway in order to produce a specific behavior, such as increased appetite or lowered anxiety; parasites also produce specific behavioral changes in their hosts, but rather than stimulate specific neurological pathways, they appear to target broader areas of the central nervous system. While the proximate mechanisms underlying this broad targeting have not been fully characterized, two mechanisms used by parasites to alter behavior in vertebrate hosts have been identified: infection of the central nervous system and altered neurochemical communication. = Infection of the central nervous system = Some parasites alter host behavior by infecting neurons in the host's central nervous system. The host's central nervous system responds to the parasite as it would to any other infection. The hallmarks of such response include local inflammation and the release of chemicals such as cytokines. The immune response itself is responsible for induced behavioral changes in many cases of parasitic infection. Parasites that are known to induce behavioral changes through central nervous system inflammation in their hosts include Toxoplasma gondii in rats, Trypanosoma cruzi in mice and Plasmodium mexicanum in the Mexican lizard. Toxoplasma gondii induces behavioral changes in rats by infecting central nervous system neurons. While some parasites exploit their hosts' typical immune responses, others seem to alter the immune response itself. For example, the typical immune response in rodents is characterized by heightened anxiety. Infection with Toxoplasma gondii inhibits this response, increasing the risk of predation by T. gondiis subsequent hosts. Research suggests that the inhibited anxiety-response could be the result of immunological damage to the limbic system. = Altered neurochemical communication= Parasites that induce behavioral changes in their hosts often exploit the regulation of social behavior in the brain. Social behavior is regulated by neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, in the emotional centers of the brain – primarily the amygdala and the hypothalamus, and although parasites may be capable of stimulating specific neurochemical pathways to induce behavioral changes, evidence suggests that they alter neurochemical communication through broad rather than specific targeting. For example, Toxoplasma gondii attaches to the hypothalamus rather than target a specific cellular pathway; this broad targeting leads to a widespread increase in host dopamine levels, which may in turn account for the loss of aversion to cat odor. In some cases, T. gondii is believed to cause increases in dopamine levels by secreting another compound, L-Dopa, which may trigger a rise in dopamine levels, though concrete evidence for this mechanism has not yet been demonstrated. This rise in dopamine levels induces a loss of aversion to cat odor in the rats, increasing the risk of predation by cats, T. gondiis definitive host. The mechanistic details underlying the increase in dopamine levels and the way it affects the rat's behavioral change remain elusive. The emerald cockroach wasp alters behavior through the injection of venom directly into the host's brain, causing hypokinesia. This is achieved by a reduction in dopamine and octopamine activity, which affects the transmission of interneurons involved in the escape response; so while the host's brain circuitry responsible for movement control is still functional – and indeed it will slog along when pulled by the wasp – the nervous system is in a depressed state. Put differently: the wasp's toxin affects not the host's ability to move, but its motivation to do so. The original function of such secretions may have been to suppress the immune system of the host, as described above. The trematode Schistosoma mansoni secretes opioid peptides into the host's bloodstream, influencing both its immune response and neural function. Other sources suggest a possible origin in molecular mimicry. = Other mechanisms = Mermithid nematodes infect arthropods, residing in their haemocoel (circulatory cavity) and manipulating their hemolymph osmolality to trigger water-seeking behavior. The means by which they do so are unknown.

He and Cornelius Cure became the leaders of the so-called Southwark school of monument design, which dominated the English market in the late-sixteenth century. Life Johnson was born in England. He became an English citizen in 1568 and Anglicized his name. Forbidden as an alien to live in the City of London, he settled across the Thames River in Southwark in the Bankside area, in which communities of Dutch and Flemish refugees flourished. Johnson married an English woman, Mary (or Marie), and had a family of five sons and a daughter. Two of the sons, Nicholas and Gerard, became sculptors and continued their father's monument business. Johnson's workshop became a major monument supplier. In 1593 his workshop employed four journeymen and an apprentice, as well as an English assistant. He died in 1611 and was buried on 30 July at St Saviour's, Southwark. Although it is known that he made some garden sculptor and a chimney piece, none of which survives, in his will he described himself as a \\"tombemaker\\".

Tomb of Sir John Gage and his wife Philippa in Church of St Michael Firle In 1591, Johnson was commissioned, ostensibly by Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland, but in practicality his mother, to erect two monuments in St Mary the Virgin's Church at Bottesford, Leicestershire, commemorating the 3rd and 4th earls, Edward and John Manners. The surviving financial papers paint a detailed picture of how such commissions were negotiated and carried out. Johnson received £200 plus expenses for the complete job. The monuments were made in the Southwark yard, carried by ship to Boston, Lincolnshire, and from there transported on 15 carts to Bottesford. Johnson and his son Nicholas stayed in Bottesford to supervise the assembly of the monuments from late September, using local carpenters and masons to alter the church floor and walls to accommodate the structures. He was paid off in November. John Matthews, a painter from Nottingham, was paid £20 in installments from February through November 1592 for \\"inricheinge\\" the two tombs.Llewellyn, Nigel.

The HD 2900 introduced the ability to decode video within the 3D engine. This approach also exonerates the CPU from doing these computations, but consumes considerably more electric current. Desktop products=Radeon HD 3800= The Radeon HD 3800 series was based on the codenamed RV670 GPU, packed 666 million transistors on a 55 nm fabrication process and had a die size at 192 mm2, with the same 64 shader clusters as the R600 core, but the memory bus width was reduced to 256 bits. The RV670 GPU is also the base of the FireStream 9170 stream processor, which uses the GPU to perform general purpose floating-point calculations which were done in the CPU previously. The Radeon HD 3850 and 3870 became available mid-November 2007. Radeon HD 3690/3830 The Radeon HD 3690, which was limited only to the Chinese market where it was named HD 3830, has the same core as the Radeon 3800 series but with only a 128-bit memory controller and 256 MiB of GDDR3 memory. All other hardware specifications are retained. A further announcement was made that there would be a Radeon HD 3830 variant bearing the same features as Radeon HD 3690, but with a unique device ID that does not allow add-in card partners in China to re-enable the burnt-out portion of the GPU core for more memory bandwidth. The Radeon HD 3690 was released early February 2008 for the Chinese market only. Radeon HD 3870 X2 Radeon HD 3870 X2 Radeon HD 3870 X2 (codenamed R680) was released on January 28, 2008, featuring 2 RV670 cores with a maximum of 1 GiB GDDR3 SDRAM, targeting the enthusiast market and replacing the Radeon HD 2900 XT. The processor achieved a peak single-precision floating point performance of 1.06 TFLOPS, being the world's first single-PCB graphics product breaking the 1 TFLOP mark.Hexus.net review, retrieved January 30, 2007 The Radeon HD 3870 X2 uses the same approach for communications between the two GPU cores as the Sapphire Radeon X1950 Pro Dual and Radeon HD 2600 X2. The GPU cores communicate to each other through an onboard PCI-E switch,Fudzilla review, retrieved December 7, 2007 providing each core with ×8 (Radeon X1950 Pro Dual) to ×16 (Radeon HD 2600 X2) PCI-E bandwidth and becoming a software CrossFire setup, supporting two extra hardware CrossFire bridges. The Radeon HD 3870 X2 uses PEX8547 PCI-E switch,PEX8547 product brief, retrieved January 22, 2008 but each core shares ×16 PCI-E bandwidth. The card only sees one CrossFire bridge being placed onboard and between the cores, thus only allowing one CrossFire bridge to be plugged onto the card.Hexus.net image, retrieved January 30, 2008 AMD stated the possibility of supporting 4 Radeon HD 3870 X2 cards, allowing 8 GPUs to be used on several motherboards, including the MSI K9A2 Platinum and Intel D5400XS, because these motherboards have sufficient spaces between PCI-E slots for dual-slot cooler video cards, presumably as a combination of two separate hardware CrossFire setups with a software CrossFire setup bridging the two, but currently with no driver support.Fudzilla report, retrieved November 27, 2007 =Radeon HD 3600= The Radeon HD 3600 series was based on the codenamed RV635 GPU, packed 378 million transistors on 55 nm fabrication process, and had 128-bit memory bus width. The support for HDMI and D-sub ports is also achieved through separate dongles. Beside the DisplayPort implementations, there also exists other display output layouts as dual DVI port or DVI with D-sub display output layout. The only variant, the Radeon HD 3650, was released on January 23, 2008 and has also an AGP slot with 64-bit bus width or the standard PCI-E slot with 128-bit. =Radeon HD 3400= AMD Radeon HD3450 The Radeon HD 3400 series was based on the codenamed RV620 GPU, packed 181 million transistors on a 55 nm fabrication process, and had 64-bit memory bus width. Products were available in full height ATX cards and low-profile cards.AMD official low-profile design with DisplayPort, retrieved January 23, 2008 One of the notable features is that the Radeon HD 3400 series (including Mobility Radeon HD 3400 series) video cards support ATI Hybrid Graphics.PC Watch report, retrieved January 23, 2008 The Radeon HD 3450 and Radeon HD 3470 were released on January 23, 2008. Mobile products All Mobility Radeon HD 2000/3000 series share the same feature set support as their desktop counterparts, as well as the addition of the battery-conserving PowerPlay 7.0 features, which are augmented from the previous generation's PowerPlay 6.0. The Mobility Radeon HD 2300 is a budget product which includes UVD in silica but lacks unified shader architecture and DirectX 10.0/SM 4.0 support, limiting support to DirectX 9.0c/SM 3.0 using the more traditional architecture of the previous generation. A high-end variant, the Mobility Radeon HD 2700, with higher core and memory frequencies than the Mobility Radeon HD 2600, was released in mid-December 2007. The Mobility Radeon HD 2400 is offered in two model variants; the standard HD 2400 and the HD 2400 XT.Mobility Radeon HD 2400 specifications and Mobility Radeon HD 2400 XT specifications The Mobility Radeon HD 2600 is also available in the same two flavors; the plain HD 2600 and, at the top of the mobility lineup, the HD 2600 XT.HD 2600 specifications and HD 2600 XT specifications The half- generation update treatment had also applied to mobile products.

Haack et al. Meteorite, asteroidal, and theoretical constraints on the 500-Ma disruption of the L chondrite parent body, Icarus, Vol. 119, p. 182 (1996).

Despite the eminence of his position, he is expected to accomplish this with only the troops of the town's garrison, and whatever levies he can borrow from the surrounding potentates - an impossible task. Traveling with his familia (entourage) and a siege engineer, Mamurra, he embarks on a trireme from Brundisium to Antioch, and then over land to Arete. There, in addition to the shortage of troops, he is forced to cope with the arrogance of his subordinate officers (who, since he was originally a diplomatic hostage from the Angles tribe, consider him a barbarian), and the divides between the various religious, national and political factions that control the town's government. Early attempts to sabotage the town's supply depot and granaries also make it clear that there are several Persian sympathizers inside. Under Ballista's direction, the town is prepared for a siege before the arrival of the Persian army, outnumbering the defenders by at least ten to one and led by Shapur in person. Thanks to Ballista's preparations, the Persians' several assaults are stymied over the course of several months, and Ballista becomes hopeful that the town can survive until autumn, when a relief army is expected to arrive. Unfortunately, the defeat of the Persians' \\"last\\" assault makes the defenders overconfident, and they fall into drunken celebration. On that night, a fanatic Christian priest, inviting punishment of all the \\"sinners\\" inside the town, guides the Persians to a tunnel underneath the walls, and the city is overrun. Ballista barely manages to escape with his entourage, a few soldiers, and the daughter of one of the town councilors. As he watches Arete burn from afar, Ballista reflects that he has failed to hold the town, but bitterly realizes that he was never meant to; the Empire is already engaged in other wars on two different fronts, and no relief force was dispatched to the East. Ballista's mission was simply to delay the Persian advance; in that respect he has succeeded, but his surviving the mission rather than dying is likely to embarrass the Emperor and make Ballista a political liability. Turning his thoughts to the immediate future, Ballista leads his small party away from the sack.

Garland (born 1947) is a scientist, engineer, author, and entrepreneur who co-founded Cromemco Inc., one of the earliest and most successful microcomputer companies. He received the B.A. degree in mathematics from Kalamazoo College, and the Ph.D. degree in biophysics from Stanford University. Dr. Garland has been recognized as one of the most important innovators in the history of the development of personal computers in Silicon Valley. Stanford University Garland began his graduate work at Stanford University in 1968. Garland's research at Stanford focused on the function of the human brain in controlling voluntary movement. He developed techniques in electromyography for monitoring muscle activity during voluntary movement and worked to delineate the role of the brain and the role of local reflexes in the control of muscles. This led to a deeper understanding of brain function during voluntary movement, and insight into the mode of action of L-DOPA in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Garland received the doctoral degree from Stanford in 1972. He was invited by John G. Linvill to join the research staff of the Stanford Electronics Laboratories where he worked on the Optacon project and developed the concept for the next generation Optacon reading aid for the blind. In 1974, he was appointed Assistant Chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University; he taught graduate courses in electrical engineering and published a textbook in the new field of microprocessor system design. Popular Electronics Capacitance meter designed by Harry Garland and Roger Melen introduced in Popular Electronics magazine in 1974. While at Stanford University, Dr. Garland also worked to bring electronics technology to a wider audience. Over a period of six years, in collaboration with Stanford colleague Roger Melen, he wrote a series of articles for Popular Electronics magazine describing original designs that could be built by the electronic hobbyist. During this period, Garland and Melen also published two books: Understanding IC Operational Amplifiers and Understanding CMOS Integrated Circuits. The MITS Altair computer, which launched the microcomputer industry, was introduced in January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine. That same issue carried an article by Garland and Melen on solid-state image sensors. The following month they, together with their Stanford colleague Terry Walker, published the design of the world's first completely digital solid-state camera in Popular Electronics, and began work on developing an interface to connect the camera (which they called the “Cyclops”), to the MITS Altair computer. MITS introduced the Cyclops Camera as a peripheral for the Altair Computer in January 1976. Their next project for Popular Electronics was to develop an interface between the Altair computer and a color television set. They called it the “Dazzler”. Garland and Melen again collaborated with Terry Walker on the hardware design and with Ed Hall, a fellow member of the Homebrew Computer Club, on the software design. The Dazzler appeared on the front cover of the February 1976 issue of Popular Electronics, and Garland and Melen offered a kit of parts for sale. To support their sales of the Cyclops and the Dazzler, Garland and Melen rented a 200 sq. ft. office in Los Altos, California and formed Cromemco, a company named after the Stanford dormitory where they had both lived as graduate students. Cromemco Harry Garland with the officers and directors of Cromemco in 1984. From left to right: Andy Procassini, Mike Ramelot, Roger Melen, Chuck Bush, Harry Garland, Glenn Penisten, John G. Linvill. Dr. Garland was president of Cromemco from its incorporation in 1976 until its sale in 1987. From the original Cyclops and Dazzler products the company developed a full line of microcomputer systems that were rated as the most reliable in the industry. Cromemco systems became the systems of choice for broadcast television graphics, were widely deployed as Mission Planning Systems by the United States Air Force, and were the first microcomputer systems widely distributed in China. By 1980 Cromemco occupied 200,000 sq. ft. of manufacturing and office space in Mountain View, California, and In 1981 Inc. Magazine ranked Cromemco in the top 10 fastest growing privately held companies in the U.S. Garland achieved this growth without accepting any external equity financing. The success of Cromemco products in television broadcast applications was based on a successor product to the original Dazzler, called the \\"Super Dazzler\\" interface (SDI). ColorGraphics Weather Systems, a customer of Cromemco, developed software for the SDI specifically for television weather graphics and digital art creation. Dynatech, the parent company of ColorGraphics Weather Systems, sought to acquire Cromemco to provide the computer and graphics systems for their broadcast division, and purchased Cromemco in 1987. Further activity In 1990 Dr. Garland was invited by Dr. Hajime Mitarai, president of Canon Inc., to help establish a new R&D; center for Canon in Silicon Valley. Dr. Garland served as Vice President of this new center, Canon Research Center America, from 1990 to 2001. At Canon he developed technology for medical digital radiography equipment, and worked on standards to integrate this equipment with hospital and radiology information systems. He served on the Kalamazoo College Board of Trustees from 1987 to 2005, and on the board of Industry Initiatives for Science and Math Education (IISME) from 1996 to 2010 including a term as president of that board. In 2002 Dr. Garland co-founded Garland Actuarial LLC with his wife, Roberta J. Garland, and serves as chairman of the firm. Recognition Dr. Garland's contributions to the computer industry have been recognized in numerous books and on television, including appearances on the Financial News Network, The Personal Computer Show, The Screen Savers, and in the PBS documentary Triumph of the Nerds. He has received the Sesquicentennial Award from Kalamazoo College and the Distinguished Alumni Award. He is the author of three books: Understanding IC Operational Amplifiers, Understanding CMOS Integrated Circuits, and Introduction to Microprocessor System Design. He has been awarded 20 U.S. Patents.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. History The first resident in the Pickford area was Charles W. Pickford, who established a farm on the site of the village in 1877. His brother Thomas founded the first store in the area in 1880, and the population grew to over 100 during the next decade, to a peak of 500 people in 1903. However, it was only in 1899 that the village of Pickford was formally platted, and the small downtown gained a number of commercial buildings during the first decade of the 1900s. James L. Lipsitt arrived in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan from Ontario in 1875. He worked as a blacksmith for a number of years, but also ran a livery stable, a farm machinery business, and a contracting business (with which he built a number of buildings at Fort Brady). He was also president of a local bank, and served as the mayor of Sault Ste. Marie. Lipsett opened a branch of his farm implement and hardware business in Pickford at some point in the early 1900s, and by 1911 was making plans to construct a new building to house it. He hired John B. Irwin of Sault Ste. Marie to construct the new building, and it was completed in August 1912. James Lipsitt's son Verne L. Lipsitt managed the hardware store, and also ran a Ford dealership in the building from 1912 until 1917, when a separate building was constructed for the dealership. Verne assumed ownership of the store in the mid-1920s, and Lipsett Hardware remained in the building until 1953, when Verne sold the business to Harvey R. and Margaret Blair and Lewis H. and Etta Marie Harrison. The business continued as \\"Lipsett Hardware\\" until 1960, when Harrison bought out his partner and changed the name to \\"Harrison Hardware.\\" The Harrisons ran the store until 1979, when they sold it to Clifford R. Waybrant, who ran the hardware store for three more years until it closed in 1982. The building was remodeled, and held several shops over the years as Waybrant rented out the space to different businesses. In 1991, Waybrant sold the building, and it remained vacant for a decade. In 2001, the Pickford Area Historical Society bought the building. Major restoration was carried out over the next few years, culminating with the installation of a replica cornice in 2011. The Society moved into the building in 2006. As of 2013, the Pickford Area Historical Society still occupies the building. Description The Lipsett Hardware Store is a two-story brick building with a flat timber roof, sitting on a concrete foundation measuring by . The grade slopes downward to the rear, so that an entrance directly into the basement level is cut into the rear face of the building. Small arch-topped basement windows along the top of the foundation line the rear and side walls. No other windows line the side, but the rear contains four single windows on the first floor and three pairs on the second. The front facade is symmetrical, featuring a slant-sided recessed entryway with the door at grade level. The entryway is flanked by heavy piers, with large glass store windows to each side and three paired windows on the second floor. A brick beltcourse runs above the entrance and serves as the sills for the upper-story windows. A metal cornice runs across the top. The present facade dates from 2004-2005, when extensive restoration work was done to restore the building to its original appearance. Inside, the first floor is one large space, and the ceiling is finished with an elaborate pressed tin ceiling original to the building. The tin has a slight cove around the edges and central support beam. A staircase in the rear provides access to the second floor. The second floor is a single space, all unfinished, which provides a view of the timber roof above.

It includes a kindergarten, pre-school, elementary school, middle school and upper school. The German School London is one of 140 schools abroad that the Federal Republic of Germany and the local school association has established to promote the German culture and language in other countries. The German School London has established a bilingual system so that students have the choice between two different qualifications, the Abitur and the International Baccalaureate.  History  The Federal Republic of Germany bought Douglas House and grounds in 1969 and built a school around it. The house became the reception and school offices. The school opened in September 1971. Additional school buildings, designed by the German firm Kersten Mertinoff & Struhk, were erected in the grounds between 1972 and 1983. The executive architects were W H Marmorek and Clifford Culpin & Partners. The school opened to primarily serve children of diplomatic staff from the embassies of German-speaking countries (West Germany, Austria, and Switzerland), while some expatriate children were enrolled.Moore, Google Books PT90 (actual page number unstated).  Operations  The School Association's Board, an unpaid group that operates the school, determines the school's financial, economic and legal business, as well as budgeting and personnel matters.  Campus  Modern buildings at the German School The school consists of four main buildings – a building for the upper and middle school, a newly established building for the elementary school, a building for pre- school and kindergarten and a sports building including a gym, a swimming pool and changing rooms.  Curriculum  The school largely follows the curriculum of Baden-Württemberg. English is taught from the first year. The aim is for students to be fully bilingual when they graduate from the school so as to be equally equipped to attend German-speaking and English-speaking universities. = Kindergarten and pre-school = The bilingualGerman and English are both used. kindergarten and pre-school focus on preparing the children for elementary school, teaching children how to deal with certain situations and helping them develop self-confidence and independence. Since July 2013 the school has been exempt from the British EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage) learning and development requirements and is now guided by Baden- Wuerttemberg's curriculum. = Elementary school = The curriculum in the elementary school consists of German, English, mathematics, social studies & sciences, music, arts, religion and physical education. = Middle school and upper school = In middle and upper school students study 10 to 13 subjects – German, English, French or Latin, mathematics, physics, chemistry, music, arts, religion or ethics, history, geography and politics. Students can choose Spanish as an additional language. The number and variety of subjects varies according to the student's grade. The school offers a broad and differentiated education with bilingual units for different talents and prepares students for university life. = Qualifications = The school has offered the International Baccalaureate since 2010; it is taught in English. Students in Years 11 and 12 can, if they wish, study for both the International Baccalaureate and the Abitur.  Faculty and staff  In 2000, about 36 of the teachers were locally hired, while the German government posted the other 14 there for two- to six-year terms.Moore, Google Books PT91 (actual page number unstated).  School life  The school provides networking opportunities for adults from the German community. Much of the community's social activities and sporting clubs for Germans are organised around the school, which \\"provides a forum for the expression of Germanness\\".Moore, Google Books PT92 (actual page number unstated). = Sport, music and art = Teams from the school have taken part in international sporting events in soccer, basketball, volleyball, badminton and tennis. Students take part in school concerts and in the Jugend musiziert competition, an international music competition in Germany between children and young people held at regional, federal and national level. The school also takes part in art competitions such as the annual exhibition of the Royal College of Art. = School exchanges = The school operates a programme of school exchange visits, where the students visit a different school for a day and participate in the classes, and family exchange visits where they meet their exchange partner on a Friday afternoon and spend time with them and their family until the Saturday. There are also programmes for students in Years 10, 11 and 12, where they visit the Russell School to teach the German language and culture to Year 5 students. = School charity = The school has its own charity group, DSLaktiv – Schüler für Schüler, founded in 2010. Every year students in the group choose a different charity to support and organise activities and projects to fundraise for it. = School events = As well as teaching the German curriculum the school promotes German culture. Every school year there are readings by authors and poets and performances by musicians. The school has Osterbrunnen and Oktoberfest celebrations, as well as Weihnachtsmarkt, a Christmas fair. There are also regular Frühschoppen events.

The term bond-out derives from connecting (or bonding) the emulation circuitry to these external pins. These devices are designed to be used within an in-circuit emulator and are not typically used in any other kind of system. Bond-out pins were marked as no-connects in the first devices produced by Intel, and were usually not connected to anything on the ordinary production silicon. Later bond-out versions of the microprocessor were produced in a bigger package to provide more signals and functionality.How the Microprocessor Evolved Over Time - By Robert R. Collins - Dr. Dobb's - Undocumented Corner September 1997 Bond-out processors provides capabilities far beyond those of a simple ROM monitor. A ROM monitor is a firmware program that runs instead of the application code and provides a connection to a host computer to carry out debugging functions. In general the ROM monitor uses part of the processor resources and shares the memory with the user code. Bond-out processors can handle complex breakpoints (even in ROM), real-time traces of processor activity, and no use of target resources. But this extra functionality comes at a high cost, as bond-outs have to be produced for in- circuit emulators only.Introduction to On-Chip Debug - by Arnold Berger and Michael Barr - Embedded Systems Magazine - February 5, 2003 Therefore, sometimes solutions similar to bond-outs are implemented with an ASIC or FPGA or a faster RISC processor that imitates the core processor code execution and peripherals.Debugging Embedded Systems Using In-Circuit Debuggers - Nikkei Business Publications, Inc.

The name is a combination of the Greek , meaning \\"low\\", and , meaning \\"neck\\". Several species, including T. gigas, have been moved to Pseudoclamoris. Description They have true iridescent colors that change based on the amount of light and viewing angle. They are relatively small compared to sister genus Psalmopoeus, averaging about long. They lack urticating hairs and are arboreal, often found in tree cavities. Many species have \\"dimples\\" on the abdomen, but this feature is not universal. Although their behavior is defensive, they lack both urticating hairs and the ability to stridulate, giving them a very mild venom. Their egg sacs can contain up to 200 spiderlings. Pet ownership This genus is well known by hobbyists for their incredible speed and striking coloration, but is not recommended for inexperienced owners. They are extremely skittish and defensive, and combined with their speed, handling them is not recommended. They thrive in environments that mimic the tropics, with a temperature from and a relative humidity of 70% to 85%. The height of their enclosure is more important than floor space, preferring of height and at least of floor space. They prefer organic potting soil with the wood removed, though similar substrates can be substituted. Their diet consists of crickets, roaches, worms, or generic tarantula food, and most need a shallow dish of water or occasional misting. With proper care, these spiders can live for up to eighteen years. Species The genus Tapinauchenius was erected by Anton Ausserer in 1871 for the species Tapinauchenius plumipes, first described by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1842 in the genus Mygale and then moved by him to the genus Eurypelma. it contains nine species, found only in South America, on Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Saint Lucia: *Tapinauchenius brunneus Schmidt, 1995 – Brazil *Tapinauchenius concolor (Caporiacco, 1947) – Guyana *Tapinauchenius cupreus Schmidt & Bauer, 1996 – Ecuador *Tapinauchenius latipes L.

During his early music career (recording as Glenn Edward Thomas), his first full-length studio album, Take Love, was produced in 1982 on Capitol Records by Soul Train television show creator and host Don Cornelius. In 1992, Thomas officially changed his name from Glenn Edward Thomas to Truth Thomas. Early life He was born into an intellectual and musical family. His grandmother was a teacher, a soprano and a violinist. His mother was also a teacher and soprano, who was also a linguist and an accomplished pianist. All of Thomas' aunts, uncles, great aunts and uncles played instruments, from French horns to cornets to trombones. He was surrounded by music as a child in the South, and mentored both by the music of his family and the music of the Tabernacle Baptist Church in East Tennessee. In the late 1960s, after his family moved to the Washington Metropolitan Area, he spent much of his musical youth at Rock Creek Baptist Church on 8th and Upshur Streets, NW. Before Thomas fell in love with the piano, he played the violin, clarinet and guitar. Among his Washington, D.C. music mentors were drummer Michael L. Johnson and vocalist/percussionist Bobby Thurston of the band, Spectrum, Ltd. Thomas attended Montgomery Blair High School. After graduation, he attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., as a Political Science major by day, and a burgeoning singer-songwriter by night. While there, Thomas performed with the musical group Members Only and worked at clubs around the local D.C. area along with drummer George Jones, bassist Michael Paige, vocalist Patty Robinson (alto), percussionist Michael Smith and Angela Wray (soprano). He left Howard in 1980, without a degree, to pursue a full-time music career in Los Angeles. In 1981, Don Cornelius signed him to a production agreement with Capitol Records (where he collaborated with O'Bryan and Melvin Lee Davis). After living and working in Los Angeles and London for many years, Thomas returned to the Washington Metropolitan Area in the early 2000s, where he began the formal study of poetry. In 2004, Thomas returned to his academic pursuits at Howard University, studying Creative Writing under Professor Tony Medina. Truth Thomas received his M.F.A. from New England College in 2008. Present day Truth Thomas is active as a poet, editor, publisher and singer-songwriter. His work has been featured in over 70 publications. It focuses largely on matters of race and social justice, both in the United States and worldwide. Regarding his aesthetic, Dr. Randall Horton writes, \\"Truth Thomas' genius lies in his ability to take us places where we've never been before…\\" His poems have appeared in magazines and anthologies such as: Beltway Poetry Quarterly, Callaloo, The Progressive, The Newtowner Magazine, Black Poets Lean South (Cave Canem Anthology) and The 100 Best African American Poems (edited by Nikki Giovanni). In 2010, he co-founded the Washington, D.C. based literary journal, the Tidal Basin Review, along with poets Melanie Henderson, Dr. Randall Horton and Fred Joiner. He formerly served on the editorial board of the Little Patuxent Review and was a member at-large on the board of the Howard County Poetry and Literature Society (HoCoPoLitSo). In 2012, Thomas founded the press, Cherry Castle Publishing, and also emerged from musical hiatus to sing with jazz saxophonist/composer/bandleader Roy Nathanson of the Jazz Passengers at The Stone (music space) in New York City.

It has been lauded as being ground-breaking in its creative combination of animation, interviews and hard facts, and has caused fierce controversy in Italy. Background The \\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\" title is derived from a British musical hit by The Smiths from their album Strangeways, Here We Come (1987). It reflects Emmott's emotional involvement with Italy—the often exasperating \\"girlfriend\\" - and the country's present state of comatose paralysis. The film was inspired by Bill Emmott’s book, Good Italy, Bad Italy: Why Italy needs to conquer its demons to face the future, published by Yale University Press in 2012. Excerpts from Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy, read by Benedict Cumberbatch, are used to illustrate the vices and virtues of Italy, connecting today’s malaise to that of seven centuries earlier and placing it in the context of Italian history and culture. Animation by the London-based artist Phoebe Boswell provides a fil rouge through the film that is light in appearance but dark in nature. Plot The documentary, using the eyes of an English outsider directed by a passionate, but exiled, Italian insider, exposes the dire situation of Italian politics and the process of economic and social decline the country has suffered during the last two decades, treating the decline as a warning of what might happen elsewhere in the West. The decline has occurred amid a collapse of moral values and the victory of \\"Mala Italia\\" over \\"Buona Italia\\". Critical of Silvio Berlusconi, the former Prime Minister, for some of the actions his government undertook or failed to undertake, and for his inappropriate use of his media companies to influence the Italian electorate, the documentary also does not spare criticism of the Left. Overall, the film identifies \\"ignavia\\", the sin of lack of moral courage denounced by Dante Alighieri in his Divine Comedy (1321), as one of the crucial issues behind Italians’ failure to act when faced with their country’s constant decline over the past 20 years. =Features= The documentary features interviews with Mario Monti, Prime Minister of Italy in 2011–12, Elsa Fornero, a member of his Cabinet, Umberto Eco, philosopher and novelist, Nanni Moretti, movie director, Lorella Zanardo, activist and filmmaker, Toni Servillo, one of today’s top Italian actors, John Elkann, Chairman of FIAT, Sergio Marchionne, CEO of FIAT, Carlo Petrini, founder of Slow Food, Roberto Saviano, the author of Gomorrah, Giovanni Ferrero, CEO of Ferrero, Emma Bonino, former European Commissioner and Italian foreign minister in 2013, Susanna Camusso, trade union leader, Nicola Gratteri, anti- mafia magistrate, but also many unsung heroes from civil society such as Don Giacomo Panizza, a priest who founded the \\"Progetto Sud\\" against organised crime in Calabria. Production It was produced in 2012 by Springshot, an independent production company, in HD in Italy and London during 2011 and 2012, and the duration is 98 minutes. Release The movie’s premiere was held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts of London, on 26 November 2012. The attendees included distinguished members of the world of arts, politics, diplomacy and business including John Elkann, Chairman of FIAT, and Vittorio Colao, Chief Executive of Vodafone. It has since been broadcast on BBC Four (300,000 viewers), Sky Italia and La7 in Italy (combined 750,000 viewers), as well as on many other European channels. Since then it has become a viral phenomenon and has been screened along with debates about the state of Italy and the West in public venues in Italy, across Europe and in North America. It is independently distributed on DVD and online. =Reaction= Girlfriend in a Coma has been described by the Italian press as a film about how Italy \\"has been left dying by the roadside\\" (La Stampa), as \\"marvellously indigestible\\" (Il Sole 24 Ore) and that \\"it freezes the blood in your veins\\" (L'Espresso). The international press hailed the documentary as a \\"lettre d’amour désespérée à l’Italie\\" (Le Monde), and was described as \\"an intelligent, imaginatively presented documentary\\" by Philip French, film critic for The Observer. Fiammetta Rocco, Arts Editor for The Economist, wrote: \\"Girlfriend in a Coma' is a terrific film. It's funny, sad, comic, deadly serious—and shows just how you can put across complex political and economic ideas when you decide to be creative. Like 'The End of the Line' and 'One Day In September', I think 'Girlfriend in a Coma' really sets a whole new standard for documentary- making.\\" =Controversy= Originally scheduled for 13 February 2013 at the MAXXI National Museum of the 21st Century Arts of Rome, Giovanna Melandri, the president of the foundation running the museum, banned the planned Italian premiere from being held there during the electoral campaign for polls on 25 February. In a widely followed tweet and then an interview with The Guardian, Bill Emmott accused the Italian government of censorship. Stefano Corradino, director of the website \\"Articolo21\\" (a reference to the Italian Constitution article on freedom of thought), launched a petition asking Giovanna Melandri to reconsider her decision. More than 30,000 people signed the petition. But the MAXXI decision was not reversed and the film’s premiere in Italy instead took place at the Teatro Eliseo in Rome on 13 February 2013, hosted at short notice by L’Espresso magazine. The documentary has now become the centre of a social media campaign, connecting together fans, followers and anyone who wants to #wakeitalyup, as well as associations in Italy and around the world that are dedicated to bringing about change and modernisation in Italy.

The term constructivism is widely used in many fields, and not always with quite the same intention. This entry offers an account of how constructivism is most commonly understood in science education. Description Science Education is now an established field within Education, and worldwide has its own journals, conferences, university departments and so forth. Although a diverse field, a major influence on its development was research considered to be undertaken from a constructivist perspective on learning, and supporting approaches to teaching that themselves became labelled constructivist. Thus, this constructivism was largely of a psychological flavour, often drawing on the work of Jean Piaget, David Ausubel, Robert M. Gagné and Jerome Bruner. One influential group of science education researchers were also heavily influenced by George Kelly (psychologist)'s Personal Construct Theory. The work of Lev Vygotsky (since being championed in the West by Jerome Bruner) has also been increasingly influential. These workers from psychology informed the first generation of science education researchers. Active research groups developed in centres like the University of Waikato (New Zealand), University of Leeds (UK) and University of Surrey (UK), with a strong interest in students' ideas in science (formed before, or during instruction) as these were recognised as being highly influential on future learning, and so whether canonical scientific would be learnt. This work, sometimes labelled the 'alternative conceptions movement' was motivated by a series of influential publications on children's ideas in science and their implications for learning (and so for how teaching should be planned to take them into account). Whilst a range of influential papers could be cited it has been suggested that a number of seminar contributions in effect set out the commitments, or 'hard core' of a constructivist research programme into the learning and teaching of science. The perspective was also the focus of a number of books aimed at the science education community - researchers and teachers. These papers presented learning as process of personal sense making, and an iterative matter such that what is learnt was channelled by existing knowledge and understanding (whether canonical or alternative), and teaching as needing to take learners' existing ideas into account in teaching. The research programme soon amounted to thousands of studies on aspects of students' (of different ages and educational levels, from different countries) thinking and learning in science topics. Criticisms There have been a wide range of criticisms of constructivist work in science, including strong criticism from philosophical perspectives. Such criticisms have done little to stem the influence of the perspective, perhaps because they tend not to refer to the core tenets of constructivism as an approach based on learning theory and research from cognitive science. Alternative conceptions and conceptual frameworks in science education Learners' ideas in science have been variously labelled as alternative conceptions, alternative conceptual frameworks, preconceptions, scientific misconceptions, naive theories etc. Although some scholars have attempted to distinguish between these terms, there is no consensual usage and often these terms are in effect synonymous. It has been found that some alternative conceptions are very common, although others appear quite idiosyncratic. Some seem to be readily overcome in teaching, but others have proved to be tenacious and to offer a challenge to effective instruction. Sometimes it is considered important to distinguish fully developed conceptions (i.e., explicit ways of understanding aspects of the natural work that are readily verbalised) from more 'primitive' features of cognition acting at a tacit level, such as the so-called phenomenology primitives. The 'knowledge-in-pieces' perspective suggests the latter act as resources for new learning which have potential to support the development of either alternative or canonical knowledge according to how teachers proceed, whereas alternative conceptions (or misconceptions) tend to be seen as learning impediments to be overcome. What research has shown is the prevalence among learners at all levels of alternative ways to thinking about just about all science topics, and a key feature of guidance to teachers is to elicit students' ideas as part of the teaching process. The success of constructivism is that this is now largely taken-for-granted in science teaching and has become part of standard teaching guidance in many contexts.Key Stage 3 National Strategy. (2002). Framework for teaching science: years 7, 8 and 9. London: Department for Education and Skills. Previously there was a strong focus on the abstract nature of concepts to be learnt, but little awareness that often the teacher was not seeking to replace ignorance with knowledge, but rather to modify and develop learners existing thinking which was often at odds with the target knowledge set out in the curriculum. =Constructivist science teaching= Constructivism is seen as an educational theory, and a key perspective to inform pedagogy. There are many books informing teachers and others about constructivist research findings and ideas, and giving guidance on how to teach science form a constructivist perspective.

Second, tools that instrument the bytecode, either before or during execution. The goal is to find out which parts of the code are tested by registering the lines of code executed when running a test.  JCov  JCov is the tool which has been developed and used with Sun JDK (and later Oracle JDK) from the very beginning of Java: from the version 1.1. JCov is capable of measuring and reporting Java code coverage. JCov is distributed under the terms of the GNU Public License (version 2, with the Classpath Exception). JCov has become open-source as a part of OpenJDK code tools project in 2014. = Features = JCov is capable of reporting the following types of code coverage: * Block coverage * Line coverage * Branch coverage * Method coverage JCov implements two different ways to save the collected data: * Into a file on the filesystem * Onto a server (a.k.a. \\"network grabber\\") JCov works by instrumenting Java bytecode using two different approaches: * Static instrumentation which is done upfront, changing the tested code * Dynamic instrumentation which is done on the fly by means of Java agent JCov has a few more distinctive features which include, but are not limited to: * Field coverage * Abstract API coverage * Direct/indirect coverage * Per-test coverage information (a.k.a. \\"test scales\\") * Public API and SPI which makes it possible to implement custom filtering and/or mining the coverage data = Tools using JCov = * Oracle JDK (SE and ME) * JCK (the Java Compatibility Kit) * Various Java SE and Java ME TCKs * Java FX SDK * Java FX Scene Builder  JaCoCo  JaCoCo is an open- source toolkit for measuring and reporting Java code coverage. JaCoCo is distributed under the terms of the Eclipse Public License. It was developed as a replacement for EMMA,JaCoCo Mission under the umbrella of the EclEmma plug- in for Eclipse. = Features = JaCoCo offers instructions, line and branch coverage. In contrast to Atlassian Clover and OpenClover, which require instrumenting the source code, JaCoCo can instrument Java bytecode using two different approaches: * like JCov on the fly while running the code with a Java agent * like Cobertura and JCov prior to execution (offline) And can be configured to store the collected data in a file, or send it via TCP. Files from multiple runs or code parts can be merged easily.Measure Coverage by Integration Tests with Sonar – Updated Unlike Cobertura and EMMA it fully supports Java 7, Java 8, Java 9, Java 10, Java 11, Java 12, Java 13, Java 14 and Java 15. = Tools using or including JaCoCo = * SonarQube JaCoCo plugin -- one of the defaults for coverage analyses within the code quality management platform SonarQube * EclEmma Eclipse (software) Code Coverage Plugin, was formerly EMMA basedEclEmma, Eclipse code coverage plugin * Jenkins JaCoCo PluginJenkins JaCoCo Plugin * Netbeans JaCoCo supportNetBeans JaCoCo support * IntelliJ IDEA since v11 * Gradle JaCoCo PluginGradle JaCoCo Plugin * Visual Studio Team ServicesJaCoCo integration in Visual Studio Team Services * TeamCityJaCoCo integration in TeamCity * STAMP (https://www.stamp- project.eu/)Jacoco is used by STAMP DSpot tool as a test selector (seen as a fitness) to select tests that increase the coverage and have unique executed path  OpenClover  OpenClover is a free and open-source successor of Atlassian Clover, created as a fork from the Clover code base published by Atlassian in 2017. It contains all features of the original Clover (the server edition). The OpenClover project is led by developers who maintained Clover in years 2012–2017.OpenClover - About us OpenClover uses source code instrumentation technique and handles Java, Groovy and AspectJ languages. Some of its features include: fine control over scope of coverage measurement, test optimisation and sophisticated reports. OpenClover integrates with Ant, Maven, Gradle, Grails, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Bamboo, Jenkins, Hudson, Griffon, SonarQube and AspectJ.  Cobertura  Cobertura is an open-source tool for measuring code coverage. It does so by instrumenting the byte code.  Serenity  Serenity is an open-source toolkit for measuring and reporting Java code coverage. As well as coverage, major code metrics are measured:- cyclometric complexity, stability, abstractness and distance from main. The report data is persisted to an object database, and made available via Jenkins/Hudson. The interface replicates the Eclipse IDE interface visually. Serenity dynamically enhances the byte code, making a post-compile step unnecessary. Ant and Maven projects are supported. Configuration is done in xml, an Ant example would be: And a Maven configuration example would be: -Dincluded.packages=your.package.name.here -Dincluded.adapters=coverage,complexity,dependency -javaagent:serenity/serenity.jar -Xms512m -Xmx1024m \${included.packages} \${included.adapters} For a full example of a configuration please refer to the Jenkins wiki at https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Serenity+Plugin.

It supports branch coverage and per-test coverage tracking.  Notable historic tools = Clover = Clover is a Java code coverage analysis utility bought and further developed by Atlassian. In April 2017 Atlassian announced end-of- life of Clover and at the same time open-sourced it under Apache 2.0 license. Clover uses a source code instrumentation technique (as opposed to Cobertura and JaCoCo, which use byte code instrumentation), which has its advantages (such as an ability to collect code metrics) and disadvantages (re-compilation of sources is necessary).\\"Why does Clover use source code instrumentation?\\" Some of its features include historical reporting, huge control over the coverage gathering process, command line toolset and API for legacy integration and more. Clover also allows testing time to be reduced by only running the tests that cover the application code that was modified since the previous build. This is called Test OptimizationTest Optimization and can lead to huge drops in the amount of time spent waiting for automated tests to complete. Clover comes with a number of integrations both developed by Atlassian (Ant, Maven, Grails, Eclipse, IDEA, Bamboo) and by open source community (Gradle, Griffon, Jenkins, Hudson, Sonar). In April 2017, Atlassian announced that they would no longer release new versions of Clover after version 4.1.2, and its code was made available as open-source software hosted on Bitbucket. = EMMA = EMMA is an open-source toolkit for measuring and reporting Java code coverage.

Their mission is to educate the Milwaukee community about the environment, conservation, sustainability, and other issues related to urban ecology, as well as to preserve and protect the natural areas in the city. In 1991, a group of residents of the Riverside Park neighborhood founded the Riverside Urban Environmental Center in response to the growing crime and pollution in Riverside Park. The neighborhood surrounding Riverside Park, was at one time an affluent neighborhood, which eventually became polluted and had an increase of criminal activity, while similar problems occurred in the neighborhoods surrounding Washington Park and Menomonee Valley. The organization is headquartered in the Riverside Park neighborhood. There are two other branches: the Washington Park branch which opened in 2007 and the Menomonee Valley branch which opened in 2012. Branches One of the organizations main focuses is to revitalize parks in urban neighborhoods to educate urban youth about environmentalism and nature. All three branches have a specific focus on urban nature and programs concerning conservation, which have revitalized their respective neighborhoods, which have experienced economic downturn and criminal activity. =Riverside Park= The entrance of the Riverside Park branch Riverside Park is located near the Riverwest and East Side neighborhoods. The park itself is approximately 25 acres in size. (10.2 ha) Riverside Park itself has a rich history, it is one of the three parks in Milwaukee that was made by Frederick Law Olmsted, who was responsible for making some of the most famous and iconic parks in America. The park is a mainly temperate forest, composed of mainly deciduous and broadleaf trees. The Milwaukee River runs through the park, as well as the Oak Leaf Trail. The park has a wide variety of wildlife and is a migratory stop over site for many species. Many bird species live there, such as Great horned owls, Red-winged blackbirds, Downy woodpeckers, Magnolia warblers, and Nashville warblers. The park is also home to the Milwaukee Rotary Centennial Arboretum, a 40-acre (16.1 ha) Arboretum that was built on a former Brownfield land. There is a restored Oak savanna in the arboretum, one of the most endangered habitats in the United States. It is one of twenty two US Forest Service dedicated \\"Children's Forests\\", meaning the park has a specific focus of educating children and families, while preserving the natural habitat.

Institut Montaigne’s mission is to propose practical public policy recommendations to improve social cohesion, competitiveness and public spending in a variety of policy fields. Its work is based on international benchmarks and collaborations between experts from the French business community, academia, civil society and government. Research Institut Montaigne focuses on four main policy fields: * Social cohesion: education, higher education, employment, lifelong learning * Public policy: pension, justice, healthcare, environment, European issues * Competitiveness: firms, energy, transports, SMB, digital economy, financial markets regulation * Public finances: taxation, local finances, public spending, local authorities. Institut Montaigne is also involved in promoting innovative democratic platforms. In 2011, the think tank led an ambitious research program under the supervision of Gilles Kepel on the suburban cities of Clichy-sous-Bois and Montfermeil where the 2005 riots sparked. The findings were published in the book “Banlieue de la République”. This work was later completed by “Passion française”, a political essay based on a series of interviews conducted in the cities of Roubaix and Marseille to meet candidates of foreign origin who ran for the 2012 legislative elections. Institut Montaigne feeds the public debate by providing accurate data and assessment tools. During the 2012 presidential campaign, Institut Montaigne forecasted the budgetary impact of the main candidates’ programs. A similar initiative was undertaken during the 2014 municipal campaign in France’s 10 largest cities, as well as for the 2015 regional campaign. During the 2017 presidential campaign, on top of quantitative analyses, it evaluated over 120 electoral program promises and proposals. Institut Montaigne also developed the first serious game dedicated to public finances, allowing players to understand how budgetary and macroeconomic policies impact the French public deficit and the national debt. Institut organizes political forums to which citizens are invited to draft new policies. For instance, in 2012, Institut Montaigne held a citizen’s conference on the French healthcare system. A representative panel of 25 participants was informed of the functioning of the healthcare system, its challenges and its issues. After a series of workshops, the panel released a report in which it stated its main policy proposals. Activities Institut Montaigne expresses concrete policy proposals to enhance both competitiveness and social cohesion. The ideas are conveyed through four types of publications: * Reports, which is the work produced by dedicated taskforces * Studies, produced by one or a group of experts * Policy briefs, which react to current policy issues * Books and collective works, which provide an in-depth analysis of a specific issue. Recent publications (in English) * A New Strategy for France in a New Arab World (August 2017) * Syria: to End a Never-Ending War (June 2017) * What Role for Cars in Tomorrow’s World? (June 2017) * The Europe We Need (March 2017) * The Circular Economy: Reconciling Economic Growth with the Environment (November 2016) * A French Islam Is Possible (September 2016) * Rebuilding France’s National Security (September 2016) * Religious Discrimination in Access to Employment: a Reality (October 2015) * Big Data and the Internet of Things: Making France a Leader in the Digital Revolution (April 2015)  Controversies = Actions during the 2012 presidential campaign = In April 2012, the Montaigne Institute was criticized for doing disguised advertising for Nicolas Sarkozy, while the advertising of political parties is prohibited. Indeed, a proposal resulting from the advertising campaign carried out from March to April by the Montaigne institute was compared to certain remarks made by the president- candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy, leading the CSA to investigate the file. This proposal had already been formulated by the Montaigne Institute in 2006 in a study by Jacques Bichot. Other proposals put forward during this campaign echo François Hollande's programs, such as those on priority in primary school, defended by the Montaigne Institute in its report Vaincre Failure in Primary School in 2010. Following the intervention of the CSA, BFMTV, BFM Radio or even RMC cease broadcasting for the duration of the campaign of the spots of the Institut Montaigne in favor of Nicolas Sarkozy's proposals. The Montaigne Institute also quantified the measures proposed by the candidates for the presidential election, in partnership with the newspaper Les Échos. The quality of this work has sometimes been disputed; for Médiapart \\"the ideological presuppositions, the absence of a guarantee on the impartiality of the calculations or the secret kept on the identity of the\\" encryptors \\"cast suspicion on this project\\". During the campaign, La Chaîne européenne (LCP) had Laurent Bigorgne, then director of the Montaigne Institute, as editorial writer for his political program Thèmes de campagne. This program, presented by Patrick Poivre d'Arvor, received, from March to June 2012, Pascal Lamy, Nicole Notat, Thierry Breton and Jacques Attali. = Actions during the 2017 presidential campaign [edit edit source] = The president of the institute, Laurent Bigorgne, contributes to Emmanuel Macron's campaign from April 2016. In its analysis, carried out with the newspaper Les Échos, of the candidates' economic programs, the Montaigne Institute supports that of Emmanuel Macron and severely criticizes the left candidates Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Benoit Hamon. The Institute subsequently exhibits a certain proximity to the government. Prime Minister Édouard Philippe goes in November 2018 to the lunch that the think tank organizes between member companies and political figures. Laurent Bigorgne was appointed in June 2018 member of the Public Action Committee 2022, installed by the Prime Minister to design the state reform project, then was invited to debate with Emmanuel Macron on March 22, 2019, with sixty-five other intellectuals, to deal with the yellow vests crisis. Gilles Babinet, the Institute's referent on the digital issue, was appointed by the government as vice-president of the National Digital Council in May 2018. = The Institut Montaigne, financial regulation, and the subject of public or private corruption = The institute details its work and firm positions in terms of financial regulation and against bribery on the French version of this entry. The presence on the steering committee of Marwan Lahoud, a former Airbus executive cited by numerous publications as being at the center of a commission system, in the large-scale corruption scandal concerning Airbus.He is cited by many publications as being at the center of a system of illegal commissions. In Great Britain, the Financial Times (see https://www.ft.com/content/f7a01a60-442b-11ea-abea-0c7a29cd66fe) published on January 31, 2020, in an article entitled \\"Airbus ran 'massive' bribery 'schemes to win orders\\", a photo of him with this title: \\"Marwan Lahoud, who ran the organization of strategy and marketing of Airbus, SMO, a division dedicated to securing sales in emerging markets and at the heart of a catalog of offenses ”. In Germany, the Handelsblatt wrote a long article on September 10, 2017 on these corruption cases, and in particular: \\"Although the case of Kazakhstan is serious enough, there could be worse to come as investigators turn to contracts civil aviation with China and Turkey. In the latter case, Mr. Lahoud is said to have signed $ 250 million in bribes. Airbus denies allegations, but some say Mr. Lahoud's sudden departure from the company last February now appears in a new light \\" In January 2020, the press announced that the French, British and American courts had validated the agreements made earlier in the week by Airbus and the French National Financial Prosecutor's Office (PNF), the British Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the Department of Justice ( DOJ) American35, under which the European group Airbus recognizes corrupt practices in around twenty specific files, and undertakes to pay fines totaling 3.6 billion euros: 2.08 billion in France under a judicial agreement of public interest (CJIP), 984 million in the United Kingdom and 526 million in the United States.(see : https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/020220/airbus-paye-36-milliards-d- euros-pour-solder-douze-ans-de-corruption-massive and also https://www.mediapart.fr/en/journal/france/010817/huge-corruption-scandal- threatening-airbus, also raises the question of the Institut Montaigne's report on these questions.

Played by RJ Mitte, Walt Jr. is the son of main protagonist Walter White and his wife Skyler. He has cerebral palsy, as manifested in speech difficulties and impaired motor control, for which he uses crutches.  Character biography = Season 1 = Walter Hartwell White Jr. is the teenage son of chemistry teacher Walter White Sr. and writer Skyler White, and has cerebral palsy. When Skyler tells her sister Marie Schrader that she is working on a new short story with a stoner character in it, she asks her about marijuana. Marie assumes that Skyler thinks Walt Jr. is smoking pot, but Skyler insists that she was just talking about her story. Marie asks her husband Hank, a DEA agent, to scare Jr. straight, leading him to Walt Jr. to a motel to show how meth has corroded the teeth of a prostitute. After Walt Sr. reveals to Hank, Marie, and Jr. that he has cancer, a fact he already shared with Skyler before, Jr. berates him for acting weird and nonchalant about his cancer. He also becomes upset at his father's decision of not choosing chemotherapy. Over the weekend, Jr. and two friends are waiting outside a convenience store, waiting for somebody to buy them beer. The friends run away when Jr. approaches an off-duty cop. The cop tells him he got his \\"first and last warning.\\" At an intervention held by Skyler for Sr., Hank, Jr. and Marie argue over what to do. While Skyler and Jr. want him to take the treatment, Marie, and later Hank, feel Sr. should be given the choice to decline the treatment if he wants; Sr. ends the intervention saying he will not do the treatment. = Season 2 = Jr. and Skyler are disturbed when Sr. cheerily makes breakfast despite his condition. Hoping to reconnect with his son, Sr. offers to give Jr. a driving lesson while Skyler is out. Jr. shows his skill at driving, but Sr. notices that he is using both feet to work the pedals. When Walt tries to get him to only use the right foot, Jr. gets upset and accidentally hits a safety cone. Around this time, Jr. adopts a new alias: \\"Flynn\\". Jr. later creates a website so that people can donate to his father's cancer surgery, unaware that Sr. lives a double life as meth kingpin Heisenberg and has enough money which he does not want to reveal to his family. Sr.'s lawyer Saul Goodman arranges for a wave of fictional \\"donations\\" drawn from Sr.'s drug money, in order to launder it and also make Jr.'s efforts appear successful. Jr.'s website gains media attention due to its apparent success; Sr. is uncomfortable in the spotlight. = Season 3 = Skyler and Sr. separate. Jr., given no explanation by either parent, assumes that Skyler has inexplicably thrown his terminally ill father out of the house, and he takes his father's side. He later experiences severe difficulty understanding why his mother (who already knows about Sr.'s double life) refuses to let Sr. back in, eventually snapping at her over dinner. Jr. goes to visit his father, who also does not tell him the truth, eventually calling Skyler about his whereabouts. Sr. takes his son home, where he tries to appease Skyler with pizza, to no avail. After Sr. moves back into the house and tells Skyler he has no intention of leaving, Jr. is thrilled that his father is back, while Skyler's attempt to have Sr. thrown out fails. = Season 4 = When Jr. tells his father that Skyler already set the date for Sr. to move back in, he is unnerved. Sr. tells his son he is not moving back home and buys a flashy new Dodge Challenger car for him, but when Skyler comes back she demands Sr. return it, lest he blow his cover. Rather than return Jr.'s car, Sr. takes it on a joyride, crashes it, and blows it up. On Jr.'s birthday, Sr. never arrives to help Skyler present his birthday gift, a Chrysler PT Cruiser which he is less than excited about. Concerned about his father, Jr. pays him a visit, only to find him bloodied and on painkillers and alcohol. Concealing his fight with Jesse Pinkman, Sr. blames it on gambling; he tearfully apologizes but later accidentally calls Jr. as \\"Jesse\\" before drifting off to sleep. The next morning, Sr. finds Jr. on his couch and apologizes for his drugged state, saying he does not want to be remembered that way after he is gone. However, Jr. seems to be more satisfied with his father's apparent truthfulness than his double life for the past year. Gus Fring, for whom Sr. works, takes him to the desert and fires him, informing him that Hank will be killed and that Sr.'s entire family will be murdered if he interferes. Skyler, Jr. and his sister Holly go under DEA protection at Hank and Marie's home. Jr. later watches a news report about Fring's death, unaware that his father caused it. = Season 5 = After Skyler, Jr. and Holly return home, Jr. explains that Fring's illicit activities are the subject of a media frenzy and that the DEA believes the danger against Hank and Marie Schrader has abated. Sr. and Jr. retrieve Sr.'s Pontiac Aztek from an auto repair shop. Sr. impulsively sells the Aztek to the mechanic for $50, leases a new Chrysler 300 for himself, and later leases a new Dodge Challenger for Jr. Jr. remains oblivious to his father's criminal activities until Marie (who already knows, along with Hank, and is confident that Sr. is in Hank's custody) forces Skyler to reveal the whole truth to her son. Upon learning of his father's connection with Hank's death, Jr. mistakenly concludes that he killed Hank. Feeling betrayed, Jr. calls 911 when Sr. fends off Skyler's knife attack, thus forcing Sr. to leave and eventually end up on the most wanted list. Months later, Sr. learns that Skyler and Jr. have left their house for a small apartment. He telephones Jr. and says that he is going to send money to Jr.'s friend Louis, who should give it to Jr., who should give it to Skyler. However, an enraged Jr. refuses, tells his father to hurry up and die, then hangs up. After visiting Skyler for the final time, before leaving Sr. watches from afar as Jr. arrives home from school.  Concept and creation  Walt Jr. is portrayed by RJ Mitte and is the eldest son of protagonist Walter White and his wife Skyler. Creator Vince Gilligan commented on the character's habit to be eating breakfast a lot during the series by saying: \\"Flynn’s favorite breakfast food I would think is a toss-up between some form of dry cereal or bacon. Flynn definitely loves his bacon, although definitely not vegetarian bacon — which tastes, of course, as we all know, like band-aids. Admittedly, you don’t keep a tally of how often you’ve seen Walter, Jr. eat breakfast. And then suddenly you turn around one day and you say, 'My God, this kid. All he does is eat breakfast!' So, that amuses me and the other writers as well, greatly. The idea that Flynn or Walter, Jr. — depending on what mood we’re in we’ll call him one or the other — but Flynn’s love of breakfast indeed seems to know no bounds.\\" Walt Jr.'s Flynn alias was derived from actor Errol Flynn. Though Mitte too has cerebral palsy, albeit a milder variation, he does not use crutches unlike his character. The fictional website that Walt Jr. creates to collect donations for his father's cancer treatment also exists as a real website, and as of 2013 the donations made to this website were directed to the National Cancer Coalition. Gilligan had plans for Walt Jr. to be killed off early into the series, much like Jesse Pinkman. Mitte even said that he himself wanted the character to be \\"bludgeoned and beaten to death\\".  Reception  At the 2013 Media Access Awards, Mitte received the SAG-AFTRA Harold Russell Award for his portrayal of Walter White Jr. on the series.  Other appearances  Mitte voiced Walt Jr. in an episode of Robot Chicken titled \\"Food\\".

Its work seeks especially to highlight the contribution of Afroasiatic peoples to world civilization, in general, and Western culture, in particular. It was founded in Princeton in 1984 and then incorporated in 1985 and is currently directed by Ephraim Isaac a Harvard trained scholar and peace activist. The Institute also releases a bi-annual linguistically focused international scholarly journal entitled the Journal of Afroasiatic Languages (JAAL) published by the Red Sea Press. In addition to its academic journal, it also recently launched an academic monograph series called Afroasiatic Studies in collaboration with the Red Sea Press. The Institute of Semitic Studies is the first independent research institute that focuses on Semitic and Afroasiatic studies within the United States. Major Achievements and Work Among the Institute’s major achievements to date is the sponsorship of the 1989 symposium on the Dead Sea Scrolls. According to the Institute's website, \\"This symposium was editorialized in the Washington Post as a commendable peace-making effort among bitterly quarreling scholars.\\". In 1992, the Institute sponsored the Second International Congress of \\"Yemenite Jewish Studies\\"Parfitt, Tudor. The Road to Redemption: The Jews of the Yemen, 1900-1950. Leiden, Netherlands: E.J. Brill, 1996, p. 9. where the Congress brought together over 200 scholars and many interested individuals from Israel, Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. A congratulatory message was given by the future US President Bill Clinton and the then Prime Minister Shamir of Israel.The proceeding of the congress was published in 1999 by Ephraim Isaac--Judaeo-Arabic Studies: Proceedings of the Second International Congress of Yemenite Jewish Studies co-editorYosef Tobi, University of Haifa & Institute of Semitic Studies, 1999. Also, the Institute supports a Princeton Theological Seminary project to make the Dead Sea Scrolls publicly available in their original Hebrew and/or Aramaic, with new English translations. It supports the University of Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary Project. In 1988, it co-sponsored with the Univ. of Pennsylvania the 35th International Congress of Assyriology. In 1991, it co-sponsored with Princeton University the Fifth Congress of Judaeo-Arabic Studies and another on Ancient Iraq. It has organized other major scholarly projects and frequent public and educational programs. Among these are those on the Nabataeans, religions of pre-Islamic Arabia, and Ethiopic Christian manuscripts. Collaborations The Institute has collaborated with Princeton University, Princeton Theological Seminary, the University of Pennsylvania, the New York Bar Association, the Israeli Association for Society and Culture, as well as Pennsylvania Governor’s Cultural Affairs Department, the University of the Arts, Please Touch Me Museum, the Woodrow Wilson Institute, and many others. Previous Donors Support for the work of the Institute has come from various sources, but most notably the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the New Jersey Committee for the Humanities, the New York Committee for the Humanities, Bristol Myers Co, Blum Foundation, Lawrence Gelb Foundation, New York City Central Labor Council: AFL-CIO, State of Ben L. Burman, H. J. Stich Foundation, JDC, and many generous individuals all over the US. Media Recognition Even in its first years of establishment, the work of the Institute of Semitic Studies had caught national and international attention. In a little less than a decade, its work was reported in five front-page newspaper stories (New York Times, 3; Trenton Times, 2), and its role discussed in one major editorial (Washington Post). Stories about the work of the Institute have been featured in the Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, Christian Science Monitor, and several local, national, and international papers and other media including the BBC. Mission and Peace-Activity The Institute’s mission is to promote the unique and rich contributions of Semitic and Afroasiatic culture and language to world civilization through rigorous academic research. As an integral part of its mission, however, it also seeks to integrate its scholarship with peace-building efforts in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East through the promotion of mutual understanding of common cultural and linguistic heritages. The institute is planning to build an African Peace Center in Princeton which would be to dedicated academic peace-building research and conflict mediation for conflict ridden regions in Africa.

He is known for being a prolific tattoo flash artist and a progenitor of modern tattooing.  Life and Impact Ben Corday was born in 1875. While his obituary listed Singapore as his place of birth, a report of his U.S. citizenship application stated that Corday was born in Lucknow, India. A British subject, Corday began a life at sea when he ran away at the age of 14 to work on a sailing ship. Shortly thereafter, Corday joined the Royal Marine Corps and then the Scots Guards, for whom he fought in the Second Boer War in South Africa. After leaving the military, Corday relocated to the United States, where he applied for citizenship in 1912. Afterward, Corday found work as a sideshow attraction in the Sells Floto Circus. A wrestler and actor, he appeared in two silent short films directed by Hal Roach. A man of many trades, Ben Corday was mainly known for his career in tattooing, which he practiced after immigrating to the United States. Corday lived and tattooed in several, disparate locations. He is known to have tattooed in San Francisco, New York City, Australia and Los Angeles. What is known about Corday's obscure tattooing career is primarily left to the stories passed down by his peers. His mentor, American tattooer Bert Grimm, relayed several of these to San Francisco tattooer Lyle Tuttle. In these stories, Grimm portrayed Corday as both a prolific artist and notorious alcoholic who would sell off entire sets of tattoo flash before going on a drinking binge. When his funds were depleted, Corday would produce new art work and reopen his shop. Corday eventually settled in Los Angeles, where he tattooed on Main Street. He died in his sleep at his residence on nearby Hewitt Street in February 1938. Corday was an influential tattoo artist and flash designer whose work is considered foundational to the era of modern tattooing. The Japanese-influenced style of Corday's designs, known for fine line work and subtle shading integrated with Western elements, was shared by contemporaries like George Burchett. Corday's name is known and highly regarded among American tattooers like Bert Grimm Sailor Jerry and Don Ed Hardy. Ben Corday's abundant flash, much of which he sold to tattooer Percy Waters, is widely circulated and continues to influence tattoo design.  Height  While it is certain that Ben Corday was an imposingly large man, his actual height is of some dispute. An article published during Corday's stint in New York as a doorman declares his height to be 7 foot 5 inches and his weight 315 pounds. Corday's obituary in the Los Angeles Times lists him at 6 foot 10 inches and just under 300 pounds. Corday, when filling out his application for U.S. Citizenship, self-reported his height at 6 foot 8 inches.

Biography Francisco Ramírez de Madrid was the son of Juan Ramírez de Oreña and Catalina de Ramírez de Cobreces, both from San Vicente de la Barquera in Cantabria, who had settled in Madrid. He obtained a position as a clerk in the court of Henry IV of Castile in Segovia, and then became mayor of Toledo. The Catholic Monarchs confirmed him in this position. Ramírez de Madrid was appointed Captain General of Artillery in the Zamora campaign, and was rewarded by the Crown many times for his successful campaigns. He played a key role in the campaign of Málaga, using the explosion of a mine to capture a critical tower in the defenses of Málaga. Ferdinand appointed him royal secretary and knighted him. He was awarded the estate of Bornos in Cadiz and various properties in Granada. After the conquest of Granada, he returned to Madrid, where he accumulated many properties. All the land between the Paseo del Prado and Paseo de las Delicias, and the two banks of the stream of Atocha were his. His second wife, whom he married in December 1491, was Beatriz Galindo the writer, humanist and preceptor of Queen Isabella I of Castile. They had two children, Fernán and Nuflo. He lived in what is now the Palacio de Viana in Madrid. He died in 1501 while combating a Mudéjar insurrection in the Sierra of Ronda.

A cheaply bought foal, who almost died before he ever appeared on a racecourse, Birmingham developed into a \\"celebrated racer\\" finishing first in twenty-four races from thirty- nine starts between July 1829 and June 1833. At a time when British horse racing was centred on a small number of major racecourses, Birmingham was campaigned at relatively minor courses in the English Midlands before defeating The Derby winner Priam to record a 15/1 upset in the St Leger. Birmingham remained in training for a further three seasons after his classic success, winning four times in 1831, six times in 1832, and once in 1833. At the end of his racing career, Birmingham was sold and exported to Russia, where he had limited success as a sire of winners. Background Birmingham was a large, powerful brown horse standing between 16.2 and 17.0 hands, bred by Mr Lacy. As a foal, he was sold for 45 guineas to William Beardsworth, who built up a reputation in the early 1830s for winning important races with cheaply bought horses. The horse was named after Beardsworth's home town of Birmingham. Birmingham was sired by Filho da Puta, a horse who won the St Leger in 1815 before becoming a successful breeding stallion. He was the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1828, although Birmingham was his only classic winner. His dam, Miss Craigie, had previously produced Hedgeford, a horse who had some success as a sire of winners in the United States. Before he was sent into full training with Thomas Flintoff (or Flintoft), Birmingham sustained a serious injury and was ordered to be destroyed but Beardsworth's wife pleaded for the horse's life and tended to him during his recovery. Birmingham grew up to be an unusually gentle and affectionate horse, becoming particularly attached to Mrs Beardsworth, who regarded him as her pet. In the early part of the nineteenth century the most important centre for horse racing in England was Newmarket in Suffolk. The other major racecourses in the south were Epsom and Ascot while racing in northern England usually focused on the racecourses at York and Doncaster in Yorkshire. Birmingham's racing career was unusual in that his owner and trainer avoided these courses (apart from three visits to Doncaster's St Leger meeting), campaigning instead at less well-known meetings in the Western Midlands and the North West. Many of the courses he competed at, such as those at Knutsford, Lichfield and Holywell have been closed for many years, whilst others such as Ludlow and Liverpool no longer stage flat racing. Racing career=1829: two-year-old season= Birmingham began his racing career on 1 July 1829, when he finished unplaced behind a colt named Jonathan in a half-mile sweepstakes at Ludlow Racecourse in Shropshire. On 11 August at Wolverhampton Racecourse in Staffordshire he recorded his first win as he was ridden by Sim Templeman to a victory over three opponents in the Chillington Stakes. Eight days later, Birmingham won a sweepstakes at Burton-on-Trent, with Jonathan last of the four runners. Birmingham beat Jonathan again on 3 September at Warwick Racecourse, and ended his season with a fourth consecutive win by easily beating his only opponent, a filly named Nantz, at Lichfield in Staffordshire five days later. In his last two wins he was ridden by Sam Darling. =1830: three-year-old season= Birmingham began his three-year-old season with three races in a week at Chester Racecourse in early May. He finished uplaced in the two-mile Produce Sweepstakes on Monday and second behind the filly Moss Rose in the Dee Stakes on Wednesday. On Friday 7 May he was ridden by Templeman as he recorded his first win of the year by taking the Palatine Stakes \\"cleverly\\" by a length from Beagle. On 30 June, Birmingham ran twice at Ludlow and won both races, beating older horses in the Ludford Stakes and winning the Produce Stakes for three-year-olds from a single opponent. The colt appeared at Wolverhampton on 17 August where he was ridden to victory by Sam Darling in another three-year- old Produce Stakes. Birmingham's next runs were at Warwick in early September where he appeared to have extended his winning run to six by easily beating the future Ascot Gold Cup winner Cetus in the Guy Stakes over one mile and then walking over in the Avon Stakes a day later. The result of the Guy Stakes, however, was the subject of a technical objection by Cetus' owners, who claimed that Birmingham was ineligible to run as his owner had not paid a forfeit of £25 when the horse had failed to appear for a race at Winchester. Beardsworth argued that he was unaware of any obligation to run Birmingham in the race, the entry having been made by the colt's previous owner, Mr Mytton, but the Stewards of the Jockey Club took the view that the rules had been broken, and awarded the 1,000 sovereign prize to Cetus. On 17 September, two weeks after his runs at Warwick, Birmingham traveled to North Yorkshire to contest the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. Despite his run of success, he was not considered one of the leading contenders and started at odds of 15/1 in a field of twenty-eight runners, although he was expected to be suited by the exceptionally wet weather and heavy ground conditions. The overwhelming favourite, at odds of 11/10, was the Newmarket-trained Priam, the undefeated winner of The Derby. Ridden by the Irish jockey Patrick Conolly, Birmingham raced just behind the leaders as Emancipator set a strong pace which saw many of the runners struggling soon after half way. Priam galloped past Emancipator a furlong from the finish, but Conolly produced Birmingham with a strong run to overtake the favourite and win by half a length, with Emancipator in third. The state of the ground was put forward by some observers as an excuse for Priam's defeat, but the Sporting Magazine concluded that Birmingham was simply the better horse on the day. Three days later, over the same course and distance, and in even worse conditions, Birmingham started the odds-on favourite for a sweepstakes despite carrying a seven pound weight penalty for his classic win. With Conolly again in the saddle, he won by several lengths from Emancipator and two others. Beardsworth turned down a proposal by Richard Tattersall for a match race between Birmingham and Priam to be held at either Doncaster or Newmarket that autumn. Birmingham ended his season on 19 October at the Holywell Hunt meeting in Flintshire, Wales where he won the opening race of the meeting, a Produce sweepstakes over two miles. Later that afternoon he was brought out again to run in the weight-for-age Mostyn Stakes but finished unplaced behind a colt named Old Port. The decision to run Birmingham twice at Holywell was criticised by the Sporting Magazine's correspondent, who felt that Beardsworth was subjecting the colt to \\"hard usage\\". =1831: four-year-old season= Birmingham's 1831 campaign saw him competing at five meetings, running twice at each venue. He began his four- year-old season in May at Chester, where he won the Grosvenor Stakes over ten furlongs and the Chester Stand Cup in which he defeated Old Port. In July he ran twice at Liverpool. He finished unplaced in the Tradesman's Cup, a two- mile handicap race in which he was used as a pacemaker for a stable companion, and second to Recovery in the Liverpool Stand Cup, beaten a short head after a \\"very severe race\\". Later that month, Birmingham defeated Recovery in a race for a 100 sovereign Plate at Knutsford, where he also finished second in the Peover Stakes. In September, Birmingham returned to the scene of his St Leger victory, when he contested two races at Doncaster. He finished second by \\"half a neck\\" to Emancipation in the Fitzwilliam Stakes over one and a half miles and was unplaced behind The Saddler, Emancipation and Rowton in the Doncaster Cup. As in 1830, Birmingham ended his season at the Holywell Hunt meeting in October. He finished second to Sir R W Bulkeley's colt Pickpocket in the Mostyn Stakes before walking over in the Pengwern Stakes on the following afternoon. =1832: five-year-old season= Racing as a five-year-old in 1832, Birmingham won six of his eight races. In a repeat of 1831, he began the season by winning both the Grosvenor Stakes and the Stand Cup at Chester in May. A week later he moved north to Lancashire for the spring meeting at Liverpool where his target was the Tradesmen's Cup, an all-aged handicap race with a total value of over 1,200 sovereigns. Ridden by Sam Darling and carrying top-weight of 128 pounds he started the 6/4 favourite and won from eight opponents. His performances led the New Sporting Magazine to comment that the horse was \\"7 lb. better than last year.\\" Birmingham returned to Liverpool for the next meeting in July. He finished unplaced in that meeting's version of the Tradesmen's Cup, but won the weight-for age Liverpool Stand Cup over two and a half miles two days later. In August the horse appeared at Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire where he won the local Gold Cup from a single opponent. In September, Birmingham ran at the St Leger meeting for the third time. He appeared to be in \\"beautiful racing trim\\" when winning the Fitwilliam Stakes over one and a half miles by a neck from Consol. He again finishing unplaced in the Doncaster Gold Cup but on this occasion there was a legitimate excuse for the horse who was found to be \\"coughing\\". =1833: six-year-old season= On 17 April 1833 at Birmingham, all of Beardsworth's horses were put up for auction. Birmingham was the highest-priced lot, fetching 1,500 guineas and entering into the ownership of Mr Scarisbrick. The horse began his final season with a failed attempt to win a third Stand Cup at Chester, as he finished second to Pickpocket. He then finished unplaced in the Croxteth Stakes at Liverpool on 2 July before running twice at Preston Racecourse a week later. He finished third in the Stanley Stakes over ten furlongs and ended his career by winning a sweepstakes over the same course and distance two days later. Stud career In the summer of 1833 Birmingham was sold and as a stallion prospect to General Lounin for £1,000. He was shipped from Hull to Russia in autumn of that year, together with the 1825 Epsom Derby winner Middleton. Birmingham was not a great success as a sire of winners in Russia, but some of his daughters had influence as broodmares. Pedigree * Birmingham was inbred 4 x 4 to Highflyer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

This republican faction is usually (negatively) defined as the opponents of the Orangist, or faction, who supported the monarchical aspirations of the stadtholders, who were usually (in this context) members of the House of Orange-Nassau. The two factions existed during the entire history of the Republic since the Twelve Years' Truce, be it that the role of \\"usual opposition party\\" of the States party was taken over by the Patriots after the Orangist revolution of 1747. The States party was in the ascendancy during the First Stadtholderless Period and the Second Stadtholderless Period. Ideological characteristics The two factions were not political parties in the modern sense of the word. They were mostly kept together by animosity between families belonging to the Regenten class on the local level, for reasons that differed between localities. These local factions might take sides to either faction simply based on the fact that their opponents were loyal to the other faction. There was little explicit ideological coherence, and whatever ideology existed on either side differed with changing circumstances over the course of the history of the Republic. Still, since the days of the conflict between Maurice, Prince of Orange and Land's Advocate of Holland Johan van Oldenbarnevelt the States Party stood for provincial sovereignty, vested in the provincial States (like the States of Holland), whereas the Orangist party emphasized the \\"supra-provincial\\" sovereignty, residing in the States-General of the Netherlands. The supremacy of the provincial States was first defended by François Vranck in his debate with Thomas Wilkes in 1587 during the rule of the Earl of Leicester as governor- general under the English protectorate, and later taken up by Hugo Grotius in his De antiquitate reipublicae Batavicae (On the Antiquity of the Batavian Republic). The theme was taken up again during the conflict between stadtholder William II and the States of Holland in 1650, in which first the Prince prevailed, and after his death the States, ushering in the \\"True Freedom\\" of the First Stadtholderless Period. The doctrine of the \\"True Freedom\\" was expounded by political philosophers like the Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt in his \\"Deduction\\"Deductie, ofte Declaratie, uyt de Fondamenten der Regieringe, tot justificatie vande Acten van Seclusie, raeckende 't employ vanden Prince van Oraigne (Deduction, or Declaration, from the foundations of the government, as justification of the Act of Seclusion, concerning the employment of the Prince of Orange). and Pieter de la Court in his the Interest van Holland (Interest of Holland) and De stadthouderlijcke regeeringe in Hollandt ende West-Vrieslandt (History of the stadholders of Holland and West-Friesland).

He was the nephew and brother of cardinals, and might have been one himself if he had lived longer. He served as secretary to the Papal Secretary of State, then the Pope himself, on whose death Agucchi was made a titular bishop and appointed as nuncio to Venice. He was an important figure in Roman art circles when he was in the city, promoting fellow-Bolognese artists, and was close to Domenichino in particular. As an art theorist he was rediscovered in the 20th century as having first expressed many of the views better known from the writings of Gian Pietro Bellori a generation later. He was also an amateur astronomer who corresponded with Galileo. Career Domenichino, Portrait of Cardinal Girolamo Agucchi, older brother of Giovanni Battista, 1604–05 Agucchi came from a noble family of Bologna, where he was born. He began his career in 1580–82 assisting his much older brother Girolamo Agucchi (1555–1605), later briefly a cardinal from 1604–1605, who was governor of Faenza in the Papal States, then studied at Bologna and Rome. He was made a canon of Piacenza Cathedral, then from 1591 worked for his uncle Cardinal Filippo Sega, an important diplomat for the Papacy, accompanying him when Sega was papal nuncio (ambassador) to France, then returning with him to Rome in 1594, and continuing in his service until Sega's death in 1596.ZapperiYoung He then followed his brother Girolamo into the service of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, Papal Secretary of State, whose secretary was Girolamo. Aldobrandini was the nephew of Pope Clement VIII (r. 1592–1605). Agucchi accompanied Aldobrandini on his embassies to Florence and France, the latter to negotiate the Treaty of Lyon (1601) and the marriage of Henry IV of France, then in 1604 to Ravenna, where Aldobrandini had been made archbishop, with a trip to Ferrara in the same year. The death of Pope Leo XI and his replacement by Pope Paul V in 1605 meant the loss of papal favour for both men, and Agucchi was able to spend most of his time on his personal interests until 1615, when Aldobrandini returned to favour and office.ZapperiYoung He was also a protege of the art-loving Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, acting as his secretary. Aldobrandini died in 1621 and Agucchi became secretary (Segretario dei Brevi) to the new Pope Gregory XV, also from Bologna, the same year.Ginzburg, 5; Young; Zapperi Gregory died in 1623 and the same year his successor Urban VIII made Agucchi Bishop of Amasea in partibus infidelis (a titular role, since Amasea is in Eastern Turkey), and appointed him as Apostolic nuncio to the Republic of Venice. Venetian politics were at this period highly polarized between pro- and anti-papal factions, and Agucchi's period largely coincided with the unstable reign of Doge Giovanni I Cornaro, (r. 1625–29) whose election Agucchi had striven for, but whose reign was something of a disaster. Agucchi left Venice in 1630 to avoid the plague, and died the following year in the Castello San Salvatore at Susegana, after a period in Oderzo. In the art world Annibale Carracci, the Cyclops Polyphemus in his frescos for the Palazzo Farnese Agucchi was a cultivated intellectual, and the friend of many artists, playing a significant role in introducing painters from his native Bologna to patrons in the Roman Curia. He was \\"an assiduous correspondent on his own and others behalf\\", and many unpublished letters survive, as well as those quoted by Carlo Cesare Malvasia in his works.Ginzburg, 6, 8 n. 30 He frequently crops up in discussion of Roman commissions of the period, for example suggesting Ludovico Carracci to the authorities for an altarpiece in Saint Peter's, Rome, though without success. Annibale Carracci had his own recommendation to Cardinal Odoardo Farnese from the cardinal's brother Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma, but became a friend of Agucchi in Rome, and is held up as a model in his writings, which also contain important biographical information on the Carracci.Young; Zapperi; Wittkower, 38–39 Agucchi may have advised Carracci on the complicated and learned mythological iconography in his frescos of The Loves of the Gods for the cardinal's Palazzo Farnese, the dazzling scheme that was Carracci's first commission in Rome, and remains a landmark work for the Roman Baroque.Wittkower, 57, 63 (63–68 on the scheme) He administered his last Holy Communion to Annibale before his premature death in 1609, and composed his epitaph for the Pantheon.Ginzburg, 8 n. 29 Domenichino joined Carracci in his work on the Palazzo Farnese, and Agucchi and his brother introduced him to Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini and the future Gregory XV. Domenichino lived in Agucchi's household for a period from 1603/4 to 1608,Young; Finaldi and Kitson, 60 and according to Bellori, one of the figures in Domenichino's fresco Meeting of St Nilus and Emperor Otto III (c. 1609–10; Grottaferrata Abbey, Cappella dei SS Fondatori) is a portrait of Agucchi.Young; Image of the fresco – the monk to the right of the cross seems the most like Domenichino's portrait in York, from some five years later Cardinals Odoardo Farnese and Pietro Aldobrandini were politically opposed, although less so after a marriage between the two families in 1600,Finaldi and Kitson, 38 but were the two leading supporters of Bolognese painting in Rome, who between them succeeded in effectively giving the Bolognese \\"almost a monopoly\\" of large commissions for palaces in the 1610s. Cardinal Aldobrandini's personal taste was for the Late Mannerist style of Giuseppe Cesari (the Cavaliere d'Arpino) and others, and his support of the Bolognese must be largely attributed to Agucchi's advocacy. The cardinal commissioned Domenichino to paint eight frescos with the story of Apollo for the Villa Aldobrandini outside Rome in 1616–18; they are now in the National Gallery, London.Wittkower, 38–39, 80 on Apollo frescos; 39 quoted Agucchi's elder brother, Cardinal Girolamo, commissioned Domenichino to paint three frescos on the life of Saint Jerome in the portico of Sant'Onofrio in Rome, which are still in place. This was in 1604, completed 1605, at the time Domenichino was living with Agucchi.Finaldi and Kitson, 60 The church also contains Domenichino's portrait of the Agucchis' uncle, Cardinal Sega, on his memorial. From Annibale Carracci Cardinal Aldobrandini commissioned a set of decorative frescos with religious subjects in landscapes for his palace in Rome, now containing the Doria Pamphilj Gallery and still in the family, the Domine, quo vadis? in the National Gallery, London, and a Coronation of the Virgin bought by the Metropolitan Museum of Art from the Mahon collection. By 1603 he owned six works by Carracci, including two of the above. The Bolognese artist Guercino only spent the years of Gregory XV's papacy in Rome, where his style changed in the direction of classicism. Denis Mahon suggested that this change was mainly in response to the urgings of Agucchi; like most commentators Mahon thought that the change was on the whole not an improvement.Finaldi and Kitson, 15–16, 21 n.37, summarizing Seicento studies Eva-Bettina Krems suggests that Agucchi is a likely candidate for the connection that introduced the Lombard sculptor Ippolito Buzzi to Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi, who provided a steady stream of work to him over several years.Krems =Portrait in York= The fine and intimate portrait in York Art Gallery (illustrated) had always been attributed to Domenichino until an article in 1994 proposed that it was instead by Annibale Carracci, from around 1603; it was owned by Agucchi until his death.Ginsburg, throughout, p. 10 on it passing to his niece as heir When the York gallery was closed for rebuilding in 2014–15 it was loaned to the National Gallery, London, and displayed there .National Gallery , Portrait of Monsignor Agucchi, 1603-4, Annibale Carracci Domenichino and Agucchi collaborated on the monument for Girolamo Agucchi in the church of San Giacomo Maggiore in Bologna, for which there are drawings in the British Royal Collection (Royal Library, MS. 1742). Writings Domenichino, St. Cecilia Distributing Alms, fresco, 1612–15, San Luigi dei Francesi, Rome Agucchi's main published writing is a very incomplete but nonetheless significant Trattato della pittura (\\"Treatise on painting\\"), probably written in 1615, whose manuscript is in the library of the University of Bologna (MS. 245), who also have an unpublished Latin biography of his brother Vita Hieronymi Agucchi (MS 75). The Trattato was published posthumously in Rome in 1646, using the pseudonym Gratiadio Machati, which Agucchi had used in his lifetime (a convention for a cleric writing on secular matters). It was included in the preface by G. A. Mosini, the pseudonym of Giovanni Antonio Massani, to a collection of prints after Annibale Carracci called Diverse figure al numero di ottanta (\\"Eighty different figures\\"). There is an English translation by Denis Mahon (1947), who did much to stimulate interest in Agucchi as a theorist who had been previously overlooked.translation and edition by Denis Mahon in his Studies in Seicento Art and Theory (London, 1947); on Mahon, see Finaldi and Kitson, 15–16, and . There is a long extract, with an introduction here, pp. 24–30 The Trattato \\"is a lively document on official Roman art circles during the years 1607–15 and concentrates specifically on exalting the idea della bellezza, which Agucchi identifies particularly in ancient sculpture.\\" The work shows signs of having been influenced by discussions with Domenichino, reflecting a division of national and regional schools of painting that the latter claimed as his own in a letter, and is essentially that used until the 20th century, distinguishing in Italy the Roman, Venetian, Lombard, and Tuscan (Florentine and Sienese) schools. It has been suggested that the Trattato may have been in effect a collaboration, with the polished prose of Agucchi writing up Domenichino's thoughts, although this is mostly thought not to be the case.Zirpolo, 47–48; Finaldi and Kitson, 15–16 Agucchi drew from Neoplatonist thought, in which \\"nature is the imperfect reflection of the divine, and the artist must improve upon it to achieve beauty\\", a view already conventional in the previous century.Zirpolo, 47 He held up classical sculpture, Raphael and Michelangelo as models, who had observed from \\"nature\\" but selected and idealized what they depicted, and deprecated the Mannerists. Annibale Caracci in particular had rescued art from their artificiality, returning to depicting improved nature. The naturalism of Caravaggio and his followers was also deplored.Zirpolo, 47–48; Young The period was generally lacking in writing on art theory, apart from the series of lectures for the Accademia di San Luca by Federico Zuccari, its first president. These were published as L'idea de' Pittori, Scultori, ed Architetti (1607), and have been called \\"the swan song of the subjective mysticism of Mannerist theory\\". The lectures themselves were abandoned when the first were received with hostility by the Bolognese and Caravaggisti alike. The Idea may have provoked Agucchi into beginning his own work. Despite its delayed and obscure publication, Agucchi's ideas represent the earliest exposition of \\"the classical-idealist theory\\" that was to be dominant in most of the Roman art world in the 17th century.Wittkower, 39 (quoted, \\"swan song\\" quote is by R. Lee), 266 The younger antiquary Francesco Angeloni, was a close friend who had also worked for the Aldobrandini, in his case Pope Clement VIII, and owned at least a copy of the York portrait.Fletcher, 666 and note 19; also Ginzburg, 10–11, complicating matters Angeloni raised his nephew Gian Pietro Bellori (1613–1696), introducing him to Agucchi and the Bolognese artists in Rome. Bellori was to follow many of Agucchi's ideas in his own very influential writings on art.Young; Zirpolo, 48 Silvia Ginzburg has pointed out that an earlier piece by Agucchi, Descrizione della Venere dormiente di Annibale Carrazzi (\\"Description of Annibale Carracci's Sleeping Venus\\"), written around 1603 but not published until 1678, shows rather different attitudes to painting, appreciating the rapidity of Carracci's style and his ability to paint without first drawing – neither qualities the Trattato approves of. She suggests that reaction to the style of Caravaggio accounts for the change, which may also be referred to in a letter by Agucchi of 1603.Ginzburg, 8–10 Agucchi was also interested in astronomy and mathematics, and a member of the Accademia dei Gelati of Bologna. He had a long correspondence with Galileo Galilei in 1611–13, including passing on the data from his own astronomical observations, and lectured on the satellites of Jupiter in 1611; Galileo had made the first recorded observations of these in 1609.Young; Zirpolo, 47 NotesReferences *Finaldi, Gabriele and Kitson, Michael, Discovering the Italian Baroque: the Denis Mahon Collection, 1997, National Gallery Publications, London/Yale UP, *Fletcher, J.M., \\"Francesco Angeloni and Annibale Carracci's 'Silenus Gathering Grapes'\\", The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 116, No. 860 (Nov., 1974), pp. 664–666, JSTOR *Ginzburg, Sylvia, \\"The Portrait of Agucchi at York Reconsidered\\", The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 136, No. 1090 (Jan., 1994), pp. 4–14, JSTOR *Krems, Eva-Bettina, \\"Die 'magnifica modestia' der Ludovisi auf dem Monte Pincio in Rom.

The blue disks of half the radius are disjoint, and the yellow disks together cover the whole plane, satisfying the two definitional requirements on an ε-net. In the mathematical theory of metric spaces, ε-nets, ε-packings, ε-coverings, uniformly discrete sets, relatively dense sets, and Delone sets (named after Boris Delone) are several closely related definitions of well-spaced sets of points, and the packing radius and covering radius of these sets measure how well-spaced they are. These sets have applications in coding theory, approximation algorithms, and the theory of quasicrystals. Definitions If (M,d) is a metric space, and X is a subset of M, then the packing radius of X is half of the infimum of distances between distinct members of X. If the packing radius is r, then open balls of radius r centered at the points of X will all be disjoint from each other, and each open ball centered at one of the points of X with radius 2r will be disjoint from the rest of X. The covering radius of X is the infimum of the numbers r such that every point of M is within distance r of at least one point in X; that is, it is the smallest radius such that closed balls of that radius centered at the points of X have all of M as their union. An ε-packing is a set X of packing radius ≥ ε/2 (equivalently, minimum distance ≥ ε), an ε-covering is a set X of covering radius ≤ ε, and an ε-net is a set that is both an ε-packing and an ε-covering. A set is uniformly discrete if it has a nonzero packing radius, and relatively dense if it has a finite covering radius. A Delone set is a set that is both uniformly discrete and relatively dense; thus, every ε-net is Delone, but not vice versa..Some sources use \\"ε-net\\" for what is here called an \\"ε-covering\\"; see, e.g. . Construction of ε-nets As the most restrictive of the definitions above, ε-nets are at least as difficult to construct as ε-packings, ε-coverings, and Delone sets. However, whenever the points of M have a well-ordering, transfinite induction shows that it is possible to construct an ε-net N, by including in N every point for which the infimum of distances to the set of earlier points in the ordering is at least ε. For finite sets of points in a Euclidean space of bounded dimension, each point may be tested in constant time by mapping it to a grid of cells of diameter ε, and using a hash table to test which nearby cells already contain points of N; thus, in this case, an ε-net can be constructed in linear time... For more general finite or compact metric spaces, an alternative algorithm of Teo Gonzalez based on the farthest-first traversal can be used to construct a finite ε-net. This algorithm initializes the net N to be empty, and then repeatedly adds to N the farthest point in M from N, breaking ties arbitrarily and stopping when all points of M are within distance ε of N.. In spaces of bounded doubling dimension, Gonzalez' algorithm can be implemented in O(n log n) time for point sets with a polynomial ratio between their farthest and closest distances, and approximated in the same time bound for arbitrary point sets.. Applications=Coding theory= In the theory of error-correcting codes, the metric space containing a block code C consists of strings of a fixed length, say n, taken over an alphabet of size q (can be thought of as vectors), with the Hamming metric. This space is denoted by \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{A}_q^n. The covering radius and packing radius of this metric space are related to the code's ability to correct errors. =Approximation algorithms= describe an algorithmic paradigm that they call \\"net and prune\\" for designing approximation algorithms for certain types of geometric optimization problems defined on sets of points in Euclidean spaces. An algorithm of this type works by performing the following steps: #Choose a random point p from the point set, find its nearest neighbor q, and set ε to the distance between p and q. #Test whether ε is (approximately) bigger than or smaller than the optimal solution value (using a technique specific to the particular optimization problem being solved) #*If it is bigger, remove from the input the points whose closest neighbor is farther than ε #*If it is smaller, construct an ε-net N, and remove from the input the points that are not in N. In both cases, the expected number of remaining points decreases by a constant factor, so the time is dominated by the testing step. As they show, this paradigm can be used to construct fast approximation algorithms for k-center clustering, finding a pair of points with median distance, and several related problems. A hierarchical system of nets, called a net-tree, may be used in spaces of bounded doubling dimension to construct well-separated pair decompositions, geometric spanners, and approximate nearest neighbors.. =Crystallography= For points in Euclidean space, a set X is a Meyer set if it is relatively dense and its difference set X − X is uniformly discrete. Equivalently, X is a Meyer set if both X and X − X are Delone. Meyer sets are named after Yves Meyer, who introduced them (with a different but equivalent definition based on harmonic analysis) as a mathematical model for quasicrystals. They include the point sets of lattices, Penrose tilings, and the Minkowski sums of these sets with finite sets.. The Voronoi cells of symmetric Delone sets form space-filling polyhedra called plesiohedra..

Kerness, M.D.) Z-KAT, Inc. was developing a novel haptic robotic system for medical applications, amongst a wide variety of computer-assisted surgery technologies. Z-KAT's initial haptic robotic arm technology, known as the Whole Arm Manipulator (or WAM Arm) was originally developed at MIT and then at Barrett Technology. Z-KAT's core technology team had adapted the WAM Arm for use as a testbed for surgical procedures. The initial success of the internal tests led to the development of a business plan to focus exclusively on the idea of haptic robotic technology in orthopedic surgery. MAKO's original technical team (Rony Abovitz, Arthur Quaid Ph.D., Hyosig Kang Ph.D., Lou Arata, Ph.D., and others) demonstrated a number of breakthroughs in robotics and controls, enabling a haptic robotic system (6dof) to perform accurate bone shaping through minimally invasive incisions (knee and hip). MAKO's first MAKOplasty Partial Knee Replacement Procedure was performed in June 2006 by Martin Roche M.D. and the company went public on the NASDAQ with their IPO in February 2008. The company's first MAKOplasty Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) procedure was performed in October 2010. The company reached milestones with the 500th MAKOplasty procedure performed in 2008, the 1000th by 2009, and more than 23,000 by 2012. Products MAKO Surgical Corp. markets the RIO Robotic Arm Interactive Orthopedic System and RESTORIS Family of Implants for partial knee and total hip arthroplasty known as MAKOplasty. MAKOplasty increases accuracy in aligning and placing implants. The RIO system assists surgeons by creating a 3-D model of the patients' anatomy, enabling surgeons to develop a pre- surgical plan that customizes implant size, positioning and alignment specifically for each patient. During the procedure, real-time visual, tactile, and auditory feedback enforces a safety-zone and facilitates ideal implant positioning and placement, which reduces potential for complications. MAKOplasty is offered in over 150 hospitals such as Jordan Hospital in Massachusetts, Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, Quincy Medical Center in Massachusetts, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, the St. Cloud Hospital in St. Cloud, Minnesota url = https://www.centracare.com/services/orthopedics/bone-joint-center/ and the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida.

They were used during World War I as part of the Third Air Instructional Center, American Expeditionary Forces for training United States airmen prior to being sent into combat on the Western Front. It was at that time the largest air base in the world. Today the entire complex consists of agricultural fields, the military facility totally obscured with no trace of its wartime history. History=Background= By the summer of 1917, two and a half years of the air war had begun to take a serious toll on the number of French and British aviators. While the United States possessed a relatively enormous pool of human resources, she lacked the well developed training methods and aircraft production capabilities of the Allies. In order to maximize the resources of both, the French submitted a memorandum to General George O. Squier, then the Chief Signal Officer of the U.S. Army, suggesting the establishment of an American advanced flying school in France.Galipeau, Douglas A. Major (1997) Issoudun: Making of America's First Eagles. Research Paper, Air Command and Staff College, USAF Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama The site decided upon for this advanced aviation school was Issoudun, France. Issoudun, located about 100 miles southeast of Paris, was primarily chosen because the surrounding countryside was extremely level and relatively sparsely populated with wide-open spaces for flying fields. The site was also relatively close to a major government- owned railroad line. Probably just as important was its proximity to the aviation factories and new plane assembly fields in the south which were to supply the aircraft to be used in the training at Issoudun. In spite of the advantages of this location, significant work was required to bring the Third Aviation Instruction Center (3rd AIC), as it was to be named, to life. Eddie Rickenbacker, Douglas Campbell, and Kenneth Marr of the 94th Aero Pursuit Squadron all trained at Issoudun When General John J. Pershing first saw the site it was nothing but a series of flat fields, with no barracks, hangars, buildings or classroom facilities. Under the agreement with the French, the United States was, “…to furnish 200 workman to erect it (3d AIC) and ‘all the tools, nails and other implements necessary,’ including a narrow-gauge railroad, while France was to furnish the planes, motors and suitably cleared land.” With this accomplished, American pilots were to begin training in July of 1917 and be ready for the front in the fall of the same year. While this proposal was approved by Pershing, it met some resistance when it reached the Secretary of War. With an initial price tag of almost $800,000 just to open the field, the proposal was rejected by the Secretary of War on 19 May 1917. That same day the proposal was resubmitted with the additional argument that a facility such as the 3d AIC was critical to the development of the air forces that would accompany the A.E.F. to Europe. This time the proposal was accepted and by July 1917 the first Aero Construction Squadrons began to arrive in France. By early fall of that same year construction at the field was in full- swing. While the initial pace of building was hectic in an effort to make the base operational as quickly as possible, construction at Issodun was never really completed and continued right up to the 1918 Armistice with Germany. As a result of this furious pace of construction, Issodun was fully operational and training was being conducted within a months of Pershing accepting the base. =3d Air Instructional Center= Morane rouleur high-speed taxiing trainer on Field 1 The 3d AIC at Issodun was initially to be merely a “refresher course” for American pursuit pilots arriving in France, prior to being sent to the front. The intent was for the American pilots, having already received advance training in the United States, to become acquainted with the current tactics and aircraft being used at the front. The advanced aviation schools in the U.S. were slow to develop and lacked both aircraft of the type being used at the front and pilots with combat experience to act as instructors. This lack of advance training in the U.S. dictated the development of a complete course in advanced flying and aerial tactics at Issodun. Initially, the school was initially staffed primarily by French instructors, used French airplanes, and consequently, followed the French Bleriot system of instruction. At the time, America did not have the time, resources or pilots to establish its own program in France and therefore relied totally on the French to prepare American pilots for combat duty. American pilots with combat experience and flying time in the type of aircraft being flown at the front were a rare commodity. Many of them were flying with French units, or the Lafayette Escadrille, and chose to remain with those units rather than join the A.E.F. Gradually, American pilots, either graduates from Issodun or from the American front-line units began to replace their French counterparts. Even with this gradual transition though, the training program at Issodun remained fundamentally the Bleriot system. The various fields at Issodun (initially nine, later expanded to 15) each provided a different phase of instruction, allowing the student to progress in successive stages of training until adequately prepared to participate at the front. thumb Field 5 showing Nieuport 15M, 80 HP and 120 HP aircraft The student's progression through these fields was typically as follows: Issoudun Aerodrome1918 map of Issoudun Aerodrome * Main Aerodrome : Field 1, Rouleur Field; Primary instruction, high speed taxiing : Field 2, Main Field, Dual- control instruction, first solo flight : Field 3, Solo Flying, Cross Country, basic aerobatics The main aerodrome were also used for new aircraft delivered to the base and the major hangar repair field, for testing repaired or rebuilt aircraft * Field 4, Used for spiral turns * Field 5, Used for taxiing, taking off, and landing and wing slips * Field 6, Aerobatic Field; Used for advanced acrobatics Fields #4, #5, #6 were used for basic flight training * Field 7, Valentine Field, Used for training in formation flying * Field 8, Used for aerial combat training * Field 9, Introduction to the Nieuport 18M (Graduates either proceeded to Field 10 for 2-seater training or to Field 4 for pursuit training) * Field 10, Used for observation pilot training (DH 4) * Field 11, Under Construction 1 October 1918, not used * Field 12, Under Construction 1 October 1918, not used * Field 13, Under Construction 1 October 1918, not used (planned for aerial gunnery) * Field 14, Used for machine gun training in aerial gunnery * Field 15, Under Construction 1 October 1918, not used Operating the 3rd Aviation Instruction Center required a large number of organizations. Serving at Issoudun were the following U.S. Aero Squadrons: 10th, 21st, 26th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 35th, 37th, 43rd, 101st, 149th, 158th, 173rd, 257, 369th, 372nd, 374th, 640th, 641st, 642nd, 644th, 801st, 802nd, and 1104th. When the first students of the school at Issodun reported for duty to the front they were among the most extensively trained pilots of the day. The average American pilot received about 60 hours of training at Issodun and by the time he had completed aerial gunnery school, he averaged over 100 hours of training, “…nearly triple the number of hours of flying time with which pilots of the Royal Air Force had been reporting to their combat units two years earlier.” When the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, Issodun was the largest flying school in the world. More than 1,800 men had attended advanced training at Issodun, of whom 829 completed the pursuit course, 627 served in combat against the Germans on the Western Front, and 202 became instructors. The combat record of those who went to the front speaks for itself—781 enemy planes and 73 balloons destroyed at the cost of 289 aircraft and 48 balloons lost by the AEF. =Closure= The United States Air Service formally left Issoudun Airdrome on 28 June 1919 almost eight months after the war ended. The sites of the former airfields have returned to their previous status as agricultural fields. On 28 June 2009, the people of Issoudun had a commemoration ceremony in honor of the American aviators who had trained, and in many cases, died while training there. A single monument on Department Route 960 remains to mark Issoudun's part in the Great War. =Training aircraft used= Nieuport 28 shown on Issoudun Field 8 * Morane rouleurs (preliminary training ground training aircraft, fitted with clipped wings) * De Haviland DH-4 * Nieuport 15M * Nieuport 18M * Nieuport 23 * Nieuport 24 * Nieuport 28 =Known squadrons assigned= * 95th Aero Squadron (Pursuit), 16 November 1917 – 18 February 1918 * 103d Aero Squadron (Pursuit), 24 December 1917 – 18 February 1918 * 94th Aero Squadron (Pursuit), 24 January - 5 March 1918 * 13th Aero Squadron (Pursuit), 27 January - 11 May 1918 * 27th Aero Squadron (Pursuit), 29 March-24 April 1918 * 139th Aero Squadron (Pursuit), 29 March-28 May 1918 * 28th Aero Squadron (Pursuit), 24–27 June 1918 * 22d Aero Squadron (Observation), 26 June-7 July 1918 * 49th Aero Squadron (Pursuit), 2–28 July 1918 * 93d Aero Squadron (Pursuit), 7–28 July 1918 * 135th Aero Squadron (Observation), 2–19 July 1918 * 1st Aero Squadron (Observation), 29 September-19 October 1918 Series \\"J\\", Volume 9, History of the 3d Aviation Instruction Center at Issoudun, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917-1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. via http://www.fold3.com Maurer, Maurer (1978), The US Air Service In World War I, Office of Air Force History, Headquarters USAF See also * List of United States Air Service aerodromes in France * Châteauroux- Déols Air Base Cold War USAF NATO depot Air Base located 13 miles southwest of Issoudun Aerodrome Complex. * Location Map of Issoudun Aerodromes References World War I airfields in France World War I sites of the United States ","title":"Issoudun Aerodrome"},{"id":"38607542","text":"Vaucouleurs Aerodrome, was a temporary World War I airfield in France. It was located West-Northwest of Vaucouleurs, in the Meuse department of France, located approximately from Paris. Overview The airfield was built during the spring of 1918 as a main operating base for the First Army Air Service. Two airfields were built at Vaucouleurs, Vaucouleurs (North) being constructed to the northwest of the village, the support Aerodrome built in a forested area for camouflage west of the airfield in some agricultural fields used for flying. Vaucouleurs (South) was built just to the west of the village; it was to be occupied jointly by American and French squadrons during the St Mihiel Offensive and equipped with several batteries of French landing lights so it could be used for night operations.Series L, Miscellaneous Sections of the Air Service, Volume 11, History of the Design and Projects Section of the Construction Division, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. =Locations= The site of Vaucouleurs (North) was selected for Air Service use in January 1918. The general region was chosen as the center for the future American Sector and the site was one of those available after three years of use by the French. It was located 75 kilometers from the front line, considered safe for use by pursuit (fighter) aircraft. The terrain at Vaucouleurs (North) was the first airfield built by the Americans for pursuit aircraft to be used in combat. The ground station for Vaucouleurs (North) was located in a forested area west of the airfield. It consisted of 42 barracks and several mess halls, two buildings for maintenance ships and six warehouses for parts and gasoline. Ten buildings for constructed for headquarters and various offices, along with a Nissen Hut for a hospital. A standard-gauge railroad was constructed to link with the French national railway system that connected at the village of Vaucouleurs. A series of gravel roads, along with an electrical and telephone network was constructed. The airfield had ten French Bessonnenux aircraft hangars erected both on the south of the airfield and also in a wooded area east of the main road to Vaucouleurs. Vaucouleurs (South) was developed in the Summer of 1918, being leased in June. It was on top of a hill surrounded by thick woodland and had been used as pastureland. It was free of the usual narrow fields of cultivated land. The corner of the woods near the adjacent highway had been used as a park before 1914, and was laced with paths, giving an ideal shelter for personnel. The forest to the west also provided both camouflage for the hangars. The ground station for Vaucouleurs (South) had a total of thirty-two barracks and mess halls, five buildings for warehousing and maintenance shops, and six administration buildings. Also two Nissen Huts were set up as a hospital and eight Bessonnenux hangars in wooded areas adjacent to the flying airfield. =Operations= It was initially used by the 139th Aero Squadron, Air Service, United States Army, beginning at the end of May, shortly after finishing its combat training at the 3d Air Instructional Center at Issoudun Aerodrome. At Vaucouleurs, the squadron flew SPAD VIIs and primarily was engaged in training flights and reconnaissance along the lines. A major difficulty was the lack of supplies and equipment necessary to keep the SPAD VIIs operational. On 30 June, the squadron was reassigned to the 2d Pursuit Group and moved to Croix-de-Metz Aerodrome, near Toul.Series \\"D\\", Volume 2, Squadron histories,. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. In July five pursuit squadrons were moved to Vaucouleurs, and headquarters of the 3d Pursuit Group was established there on 30 July. To accommodate five squadrons of aircraft, two airfields were established, Vaucouleurs North and Vaucouleurs South. From the aerodrome, the group carried out offensive operations during the St. Mihiel Offensive and also over the Toul Sector. At the end of September, the Group moved to Lisle-en-Barrois Aerodrome, in preparation for the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Afterwards, Vaucouleurs Aerodrome was unused for the remainder of the war. =Closure= Shortly after the armistice in November 1918, the Airdrome and both airfields were turned over to the 1st Air Depot for de-construction. All hangars and other structures were dismantled and all useful supplies and equipment were removed and sent back to the Depot for storage. Upon completion, the land turned over to the French government.Series 1, Paris Headquarters and Supply Section, Volume 30 History of the 1st Air Depot at Colombey-led-Belles, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. Eventually the land was returned to agricultural use by the local farmers. Today, what was Vaucouleurs Airdrome is located to the east of the Départmental 964 (D964), north of Vaucouleurs. Vaucouleurs South is located to the northwest of the town, to the north of the D960. Both airfields are now cultivated fields, with no indications of their wartime use.

It was located ESE of Foucaucourt-sur-Thabas, in the Meuse department in Lorraine in north-eastern France. Overview The airfield was first built by the French in the summer of 1917This has to be confirmed, as the first French units arrived in March 1918. The French escadrilles left in September 1918, giving way to the American V Corps Observation Group and its two squadrons: * 99th Aero Squadron 20 September 1918 - 4 November 1918 * 104th Aero Squadron 20 September 1918 - 4 November 1918 Arriving at the same time, a detachment from 462nd Aero Squadron (Construction) stayed until 6 October to improve some parts of the airfield's organization. Over a total surface of 89 acres, the Air Service engineers constructed 12 wooden barracks and a mess hall, as well as 5 buildings to be used as warehouses and maintenance shops. A station administration building and a hospital clinic was constructed along with an electrical and a telephone grid. The airfield had four French \\"Bessonneau\\" aircraft hangars erected.Series L, Miscellaneous Sections of the Air Service, Volume 11, History of the Design and Projects Section of the Construction Division, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. The observation group provided battlefield reconnaissance and artillery cooperation for the V Corps. Operations from Foucaucourt initially were preparations to help the V Corps in the Meuse- Argonne offensive. German soldiers opposed the attack from barbed-wire- protected trenches. Also, additional enemy pursuit, observation and bombardment forces meant most of the Kaiser’s best aviation units defended the area.Series \\"D\\", Volume 2, Squadron histories,. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. When the ground attack began on 26 September, inclement weather restricted flight operations. Since cloud cover severely limited photographic reconnaissance, headquarters confined missions to a few, well- defined and extremely important areas. Aircraft and pilots often stood ready to fly, waiting in vain for any break in the clouds. When weather permitted, crews took oblique photographs along enemy lines. If the need for information was great, pilots flew even in heavy cloud cover hoping for a chance break to take that important picture. In early November, the two squadrons of the V Corps Observation Group moved up to Parois Airdrome, but the HQ stayed in Foucaucourt until 4 February 1919, soon to be disbanded. The observation squadrons gave way to the 3d Pursuit Group, which moved into Foucaucout from Lisle-en-Barrois Aerodrome with its headquarter and four SPAD XIII pursuit squadrons on 6 November, part of the 1st Pursuit Wing working for the US First Army: * 28th Aero Squadron 6 November 1918 - 11 December 1918 * 93rd Aero Squadron 6 November 1918 - 15 December 1918 * 103rd Aero Squadron 6 November 1918 - 5 January 1919 * 213th Aero Squadron 5 November 1918 - 29 January 1919 The pursuit squadrons were hampered by the bad weather, and concentrated their operations to low-level attacks on enemy infantry forces along the roads east of the River Meuse until the Armistice on 11 November. If most of the French units had left in September 1918, SOP 214 was billeted at \\"Evres\\", on the south rim of the airfield, 21 September to 25 October 1918, which probably means that it flew from Foucaucourt. SPA 215 also flew from the airfield 6 October to 4 November, both escadrilles flying missions for the American First Army. After the Armistice was signed, the group's squadrons continued flying training sorties from Foucaucourt. The 3rd Pursuit Group was disbanded on 31 December 1918, the 93rd having already left. The last squadron - 28th - was ordered to report to the 1st Air Depot at Colombey-les-Belles Aerodrome to demobilize in mid February 1919. Foucaucourt was then turned over to the 1st Air Depot for de-construction. All hangars and other structures were dismantled and all useful supplies and equipment were removed and sent back to the Depot for storage. Upon completion, the land turned over to the French government.Series 1, Paris Headquarters and Supply Section, Volume 30 History of the 1st Air Depot at Colombey-led-Belles, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. Eventually the land was returned to agricultural use by the local farmers. Today, what was Foucaucourt Aerodrome is a series of cultivated fields located east of Foucaucourt-sur-Thabas. The airfield was located to the northeast of the Départmental 122/151 intersection (D122/D151), with no indications of its wartime use.

It was located near Colombey-les-Belles, in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in north- eastern France. Colombey-les-Belles Aerodrome was the location of the 1st Air Depot. It was the largest American facility in the combat zone of the Western Front and arguably, the most important, as the 1st Air Depot supplied and equipped every Air Service unit after their arrival at the front and entered combat. Overview The 1st Air Depot supported operations of 33 combat airfields and 44 squadrons of the Air Service on the Western Front, as well as 23 Balloon Observation companies. There were a total of 950 aircraft with those squadrons, and 566 at the 1st Air Depot. Of the front-line combat squadrons, 38 were fully equipped by the 1st Air Depot. The depot supplied airplanes, flying personnel, transport and drivers, munitions and armament, radio and photographic equipment, medical and enlisted personnel of many capabilities. Once deployed to the front, the 1st Air Depot was responsible for maintaining the unit at effective combat readiness by providing replacements in all of these items and personnel to replace combat losses and the expenditure of supplies and equipment.Series 1, Paris Headquarters and Supply Section, Volume 30 History of the 1st Air Depot at Colombey-led-Belles, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. History When the United States entered World War I, the Toul Sector of the Western Front was designated for the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). Colombey-les-Belles, about 11 miles south of the City of Toul, was selected as a location for a depot with a mission to support Air Service Units sent to the Zone of Advance (Western Front) for training and combat service. =Establishment= 1st Air Depot Headquarters Camouflaged buildings of the 1st Air Depot built in the woods west of the town. The construction of the 1st Air Depot was begun on 1 November 1917.Series 1, Paris Headquarters and Supply Section, Volume 23 History of the 1st Air Depot at Colombey-led-Belles, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. The first contingent of Air Service troops arrived at Colombey-les- Belles. consisting of one officer and 20 men. For its first three months, the depot consisted of personnel from the 88th, 89th and 90th Aero Squadrons, 7 officers and approximately 450 men. The construction proceeded through the winter in mostly inclement weather. During this period the flying field construction was begun as well as barracks, buildings and hangars, with the major initial construction being completed on 5 April 1918 when most of the facility was completed. This included facilities for 40 officers and 800 men; barracks and quarters for five squadrons and buildings for storage and office purposes. A standard gauge railroad extending from the Colombey Railroad Station was constructed along with a system of narrow gauge track which connected various warehouses with the main receiving building along with the flying field and various repair shops. Several aircraft hangars were erected and about 50 acres of ground was conditioned for flying operations. By the time of the Armistice in November 1918, the 1st Air Depot consisted of more than 570 acres of land, with 144 buildings consisting of supply warehouses, office buildings and barracks. The flying field had a total of 25 aircraft hangars. The three squadrons later left for combat duty and were replaced by a permanent garrison in March 1918. These being the 637th, 643d, 645th and 463d Aero Squadrons. ;; Air Raids and Defenses French 75mm Anti Aircraft gun for air defense of the base Due to its proximity to the front lines, a dispersal plan was set up which placed the majority of buildings in the woods around the flying field. All buildings were camouflaged and set well apart from another in an irregular pattern. During its time in operation, the depot was never attacked by enemy bombing raids, although on several occasions enemy observation aircraft flew over the depot. On three occasions, bombs were dropped on the flying field, but the depot was missed entirely. Having in mind the proximity of the base to the front, zig-zag trenches were dug near all barracks for the protection of personnel. Also, an anti-aircraft defense was established consisting of four AAA Batteries. These consisted of 16 75mm guns; 30 machine guns and 6 80-inch searchlights, dispersed at positions surrounding the airfield and depot. =Operations= To function properly, six principal departments were established at the Depot: Transportation; Advance Supply; Quartermaster; Machine Shops; Aircraft Repair and Aircraft Acceptance and Replacement. Other departments of secondary importance were Construction; Post Supply; Air Service Dispursing and Medical. ;; Transportation Department Truck Supply Convoy This consisted of Railway and Motor Transportation. The Rail Transportation mission was the receipt of supplies arriving at the Depot and keeping records of items received and other particulars; unloading the cars and also loading the cars for outgoing shipments. The mission of the Motor Transportation unit was to deliver supplies and equipment from the Depot to the combat squadrons at the front, and other services as demands required, such as the movement of troops. All this transportation was kept in repair by the Depot by Air Service Personnel by men trained in the United States for special duty with transportation and logistics. Truck convoys to the front were operated in groups of 10 trucks each, this was found to be the best and most efficient use of the vehicles. The work performed by the Transportation Department varied widely. Supply trains were constantly traveling between depots in the rear and Colombey, bringing up supplies. Trains were also constantly arriving with gasoline and oil for delivery to the front. Pre- manufactured Hangars and barracks were being shipped along with supplies of all kinds. Also officers from Headquarters would arrive on trains and from Colombey would proceed to advance airfields in automobiles, demanded special cars to be provided. ;; Advance Supply This department received and issued all supplies except airplanes. It primarily handled aircraft engines, propellers, spare parts of all kinds, the hardware fasteners, mechanics tools, aircraft instruments, aviation clothing, photographic supplies, radio supplies and equipment and all kinds of oils and gasoline. Due to the wide variety of aircraft flown at the front, a great number of spare parts were required to be kept in stock. In addition to the requirements of the combat squadrons, the Department had to take care of the various Departments of the 1st Air Depot. During the Meuse Argonne Campaign, this department was supplying twenty-three Headquarters Groups, sixteen Observation Squadrons; four Bombardment Squadrons; twenty Pursuit Squadrons; twelve Air Park Squadrons; eight Photo Sections, and 22 Balloon Companies. On the first day of the offensive, for example, one Pursuit Group called for, and received, 26 replacement propellers. ;; Quartermaster The Quartermaster Department was responsible for property administration, food provisioning, finance, local purchasing and salvage. It supported 168 Air Service Units and attached organizations, such as communications battalions, anti-aircraft batteries, ordinance and medical detachments. Basically, if the item needed by the squadrons was not related to aircraft support, it was provided by the Quartermaster Department. Food rations were provided only to squadrons located in the immediate territory of the 1st Air Depot. Approximately 60,000 rations were issued on a ten-day average. Arrangements were made with the bakery company for bread and the refrigerator company at Toul for fresh frozen beef. The Quartermaster Department also operated a Sales Commissary that attempted to carry a full line of personnel items, along with recreational items, cigarettes, newspapers and magazines. However at various times, the stock was found to be quite low due to the fact that the Depot was close to the front lines and this type of supplies carried a lower priority than items necessary to support the combat units. ;; Aircraft Repair Aircraft Salvage Shop The function of this department was to salvage, reclaim and repair crashed airplanes retrieved from the front. All aircraft engine installation was done by this department, however, engines salvaged from crashed aircraft were turned over to the Engine Overhaul Shop, The 675th Aero Squadron (Repair) was organized at this department. When a plane was damaged in combat, or would crash on our side of the front line, a crew would be sent from the 1st Air Depot to dismantle the plane and bring it back to be repaired, if possible, or to be added to the salvage pile where it could be cannibalized for usable parts. The territory covered by the salvage crews was the entire length of the American Sector. When it is considered that less than 2,000 aircraft were delivered to the combat squadrons and 1,125 were brought back to the depot for repairs or to be salvaged, the scope of work of the depot's mission was an important and busy one. During September 1918, which saw both the St. Mihiel and Muese-Argonne Offensives, the work of this department was increased due to the number of damaged and crashed airplanes. Subsequently, and advance Air Depot was established at Behonne to serve the squadrons. Seven complete salvaging crews were sent from Colombey to Behonne to handle the salvaged planes that were brought there. By the time of the Armistice in November, there were 566 aircraft at the Depot, 417 being serviced and repaired. The large number of planes on hand at the time of the Armistice calls attention to the work of the salvage and repair units which was one of the most important functions of the depot. ;; Aircraft Acceptance and Replacement Various SPAD aircraft on the flying field The 1st Air Depot supplied all combat aircraft to the squadrons on the front lines. This included the initial allocation of aircraft for new units arriving at the front, along with replacement aircraft as necessary to keep the unit combat ready and operational. The aircraft were principally French SPAD, Salmson and Breguet. Also British Sopwith Camels along with Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5. Also, United States built Dayton-Wright DH-4s with Liberty Engines were also received. Aircraft were ferried to the depot by air, being flown by pilots from the American Air Service Acceptance Park at Orly Aerodrome, Paris; the Air Service Production Center at Romorantin Aerodrome or other sources of supply. The first aircraft to arrive were four Sopwith 2B2 bombers which arrived on 22 March 1918. These were followed by twelve more Sopwiths the next day. During the first week of April, these planes were delivered to the 90th Aero Squadron. This marked the first delivery of combat aircraft by the Depot. The first American-built Dayton-Wright DH-4 with a Liberty Engine arrived on 3 July, being delivered to the front in early August. The first actual flight of an American built plane was on 7 August. By 20 October, the 1,000th aircraft had arrived at Colombey. By the time the armistice was signed, the depot had received 1,993 aircraft, given each of them an inspection and prepared them with the necessities for combat service. On 11 November, 149 aircraft were at Colombey undergoing inspection and being prepared for delivery. ;; Machine and Engine Shops Machine Shop of the 1st Air Depot These shops performed all kinds of repair work required to keep aircraft at the depot airworthy and capable for combat operations. The work was performed by the 675th Aero Squadron (Repair). The Machine Shop consisted of various tools and lathes necessary. Some jobs were small and performed quickly, others required many weeks for completion for any task necessary other than the manufacture of aircraft parts, which were reserved to the manufactures of the aircraft. The Engine Overhaul Shop was established to overhaul and repair engines of squadron aircraft operating at the front. The average aircraft engine in use required dis assembly and overhaul after about 25 to 30 hours of actual service. The facilities did not exist at the forward combat airfields for this maintenance, and a constant transport of engines to and from the squadrons was necessary by truck to keep serviceable engines in the aircraft. During six months of actual operations, the Depot received an average of 10 freight cars and 20 trucks a day of supplies and replacement parts, which were also sent forward to the combat units. ;; Other functions Camera Shop A procurement office (Dispursing) was established for the mission of enabling purchases of various supplies from the local French economy. Many supplies had to be purchased in this manner due to the inability of the Supply Section to keep on hand for issue everything required. This included the payment of all personnel for their duties with the Air Service. Balloon Supplies were furnished primarily with purchases from the French. The Radio and Photography shops maintained aircraft radio equipment and observation cameras. In addition to the aircraft and supply functions of the Depot, all pilots, observers and ground support personnel assigned to the front were first ordered to report to the 1st Air Depot to receive their personal equipment. Once equipped, they would be assigned to squadrons in need of replacement personnel. By the time of the Armistice, 1,531 officers had been processed by the Depot: 712 pilots, 632 observers and 177 ground officers. =Post-Armistice= After the Armistice was signed, the 1st Air Depot was designated as the demobilization point for all Air Service units in the Zone of Advance (Western Front). At that time, it consisted of 48 Combat Aero Squadrons; 45 Service Squadrons; 23 Balloon Companies; 4 Photographic Sections; 5 Headquarters organizations and 12 Air Park Squadrons, outside of the depot organizations proper. Various support buildings (photo taken after the Armistice) DH-4 turned in for subsequent processing Truck storage The process of demobilization meant the squadron would fly its aircraft and bring its personnel by truck from its forward combat airfield to Colombey to be stripped of all war equipment. An Observation Squadron had a full complement of 45 officers, and a Pursuit Squadron 25. The usual number to accompany a squadron back to the United States was nine, the remainder of the officers being released and ordered to the United States as casual individuals. Aircraft were stripped of their guns by the Ordnance Department; their radio equipment by that department, the trucks being turned over to the Motor Transport Corps, and all other combat equipment sorted and stored at the depot. Due to the large number of units being processed, it became necessary to erect many more hangars to take care of the planes being delivered by the squadrons. Also, a sufficient number of planes were kept in operational condition to supply those units still in the field and also to the Third Army Air Service, on occupation duty in the Rhineland. Once the aircraft had their guns, cameras, radios and other supplemental equipment removed, the French and English aircraft were ferried to Orly Aerodrome so they could be stricken off record and returned to their host countries. The United States DH-4 built aircraft were sent to Romomartin for final disposition. It was found that the process of demobilization of a unit took about 48 hours to receive and strip a squadron and have it ready for transport to one of the base ports for embarkation back to the United States. The overwhelming number of personnel outstripped the capability to transport units home, and the vast majority of units were ordered to proceed to transient camps where personnel waited for a ship to board and go back to the United States. In addition to this duty, the 1st Air Depot was called upon to dismantle the combat airfields on the front. This meant about 100 fields were to be dismantled, either by turning them over to the French or by removing all structures on them, collecting all equipment and supplies left at them, and turning over the land to the French Government so the original owners could use it for peaceful uses. Until April 1919, the Air Service kept 25 combat squadrons, 13 Balloon Companies and other necessary units in the field. This was reduced to 14 Squadrons and 10 Balloon companies of the Third Army Air Service by the end of April when all units in France were ordered demobilized. The last American Air Service units in France were processed by the Depot on 3 May. The entire Third Army Air Service, excepting that of the III Corps 138th Aero Squadron, one air park, and one construction squadron, were relieved from further duty with the Third Army on 12 May 1919 and ordered to proceed to the 1st Air Depot for demobilization. The 138th was reassigned to Air Service HQ and took over the courier and liaison duties of the Third Army until the entire Third Army Air Service Headquarters itself was demobilized on 2 July 1919. =Subsequent history= Map of the 1st Air Depot and Colombey-les-Belles Aerodrome. Most of the roads and locations of the infrastructure of the facility can be found on modern-day Google Map of the area. (Click on the map for high resolution) The last mission of the 1st Air Depot was the dismantlement of Colombey-les-Belles Aerodrome. During the summer of 1919, as its mission would down, buildings were taken down, hangars dismantled, stocks of equipment disposed of and the 1st Air Depot itself demobilized during July, its last personnel leaving for the United States by the end of the month. Today, both the depot as well as the airfield is a series of fields in agricultural use. Some wooded areas remain and have grown themselves in, leaving no visible evidence of its use as a major military depot. The depot was located to the west of the town of Colombey-les-Belles, along the Départmental 4 (D4), which itself was the main street of the depot. The airfield was located to the northwest of the town, again is now all agricultural fields with some development of new roads, including the A31 autoroute dissecting it.

It was located on the plateau north of the commune of Lisle-en-Barrois, in the Meuse department in north-eastern France. Overview In 1915, the French escadrille MS 37 stayed from 19 August to 16 October near the \\"ferme de Vaudoncourt\\", 1 miles north of lisle en Barrois. A new airfield was built during summer 1918, initially for the French Air Service: Groupe de Combat no 12 and its four escadrilles SPA 3, SPA 26, SPA 67 and SPA 103 stayed from 9 to 19 September. As no other French unit is known to have stayed later, it can be assumed that the airfield was transferred to the Air Service, United States Army in the following days. 3d Pursuit Group headquarters arrived on 20 September 1918 with four squadrons (28th, 93rd, 103rd and 213th Aero Squadrons), flying missions for the US First Army during both the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne Offensives. In support of the flying squadrons, the 2d Air Park had a flight of mechanics for repair of both aircraft and vehicles. 462nd Aero Squadron (construct.) arrived at the same time to improve the airfield installations, leaving on 6 October towards Parois Aerodrome, near Clermont en Argonne. By 6 November, with the front moving to the west and north, the 3d Pursuit Group moved up to Foucaucourt Aerodrome, and Lisle-en-Barrois airfield was abandoned. After the armistice, the airfield was returned to agricultural use. Today it is a series of cultivated fields located on the east side of the Départmental 2 (D2), north of Lisle-en-Barrois, with no indications of its wartime use.

Early life  Frederic was one of two illegitimate children recognised by King Martin the Younger of Sicily. His mother was his father's concubine, the Sicilian noblewoman Tarsia Rizzani. In 1403, Frederic and his likewise illegitimate paternal half-sister Violant were declared wards of the Crown of Aragon by their paternal grandfather, King Martin the Elder of Aragon. The royal councilor Francesc de Casasaja was ordered to bring them to Barcelona and to care for them until the King and his wife, Maria de Luna, decided \\"how to deal with the said son and daughter\\". Queen Maria, the children's grandmother, assumed the responsibility for their upbringing and education. Their illegitimate status notwithstanding, Frederic and his half- sister were the only grandchildren of the King and Queen of Aragon. The Queen died in 1406.  Succession prospects  King Martin the Elder In 1409, King Martin the Younger died. His father's death, following the deaths of his legitimate half-brothers, left Frederic as the only living male descendant of Martin the Elder, now also king of Sicily. Martin the Elder was very fond of his grandson, but was nevertheless aware that his illegitimacy rendered his claim to the thrones of the Crown of Aragon significantly weaker, especially when compared to that of the closest legitimate agnate, Count James II of Urgell. The old king intended to ensure Frederic's accession at least to the throne of Sicily. He thus sought to have Frederic legitimated by the pope, but died from laughter a year after Martin the Younger.Paul N. Morris, Patronage and Piety Montserrat and the Royal House of Medieval Catalonia-Aragon, October 2000 The question of succession not being settled yet, an interregnum ensued. In 1412, Frederic's cousin, Ferdinand of Castile, became king according to the Compromise of Caspe. The nobility of Sicily preferred Frederic to Ferdinand, but the proposal to make the former into king of an independent Sicily failed.  Military career  Frederic was created Count of Luna and made an admiral. As such, he took part in an expedition to the island of Djerba, commanded by Infante Peter, Count of Alburquerque, in 1425. He also accompanied the army of King Alfonso the Magnanimous to Castile in order to liberate the King's brother, Infante Henry, Duke of Villena. Frederic resumed his claim to the throne in the 1430s, for which he was imprisoned and all his lands, including the County of Luna and the city of Segorb, were confiscated. He died as a prisoner.

Joost Jongerden has written that the law constituted a policy of forcible assimilation of non-Turkish minorities through forced and collective resettlement. Background Mehmet Fuat Köprülü, key figure in forging a national identity, which inspired the resettlement law There were resettlement policies also at the end of the Ottoman Empire. From 1910 onwards the Ottoman Empire began the establish immigrant commissions that regulated the settlement of the immigrants coming from the Balkans. The immigrants from the Balkans were not allowed to exceed 10% of the local population.Jongerden (2007), pp. 178-179 Kurds who were resettled from Eastern Anatolia to the west, were also split up in groups not exceeding 300 people and tribe leaders were separated from their tribe. The Kurds should also not make up more than 5% of the local population they were resettled to. A previous settlement law from May 1926 (also known as Law no. 885) regulated the abolition of small villages and the resettlement of its population in central location and a decree from March 1933 demanded the resettlement of the population in the mountain areas.  The Resettlement Law of 1934  The Resettlement Law of 1934 was passed by the Turkish National Assembly on 14 June 1934. The law was made public and put into effect after it was published in the Resmi Gazete a week after its promulgation. According to the Interior Minister Şükrü Kaya:TBMM Zabıt Ceridesi, Devre: IV, Cilt: 23, İçtima: 3, 14/06/1934, p.71. Taking into consideration security and political concerns, the law closed strategic regions of the country to non-Muslim minority settlement.Icduygu, A., Toktas, S., & Soner, B. A. (2008). The politics of population in a nation-building process: Emigration of non-Muslims from turkey. Ethnic and Racial Studies, 31(2), 358-389. Turkish politicians understood that many non-Turks had been resettled on their own into separate villages and therefore had not assimilated into Turkishness. Those individuals who \\"spoke alien dialects\\" had been able to differentiate themselves from the Turkish nation. It was a necessity to assess those villages in which such \\"alien dialects\\" were spoken and to distribute populations which spoke the \\"alien dialects\\" to nearby Turkish villages in order to foster and encourage forced assimilation. Under Article I of the law, the Minister of Interior was granted the right to govern and redistribute the interior population of the country in accordance with an individual's adherence to Turkish culture.‘İskan Kanunu’, no: 2510, 14/06/1934, Düstur, Tertip: 3, Cilt: 15, p. 1156. Article 11 was a provision regarding that the resettlement must assure1/335 Numaralı İskan Kanunu Layihası ve İskan Muvakkat Encümeni Mazbatası’ In TBMM Zabıt Ceridesi, Devre: IV, Cilt: 3, Ek: 189, 02/05/1932, p. 11. The settlement zones were divided in three separate zones according to the adherence of Turkish culture in the each particular individual:İskan Kanunu’, no: 2510, 14/06/1934, Düstur, Tertip: 3, Cilt: 15, p. 1156. *Zone 1 - Areas deemed desirable to increase the density of the culturally Turkish population. *Zone 2 - Areas deemed desirable to establish populations that had to be assimilated into Turkish culture. *Zone 3 - Areas which had been decided should be evacuated for military, economic, political, or public health reasons, and where resettlement was prohibited. In paragraph Four of Article 10, the Ministry of Interior was granted the authority to transfer any individual who did not possess a certain degree of \\"Turkish culture\\" to Zone 2, where forced assimilatory practices would take place.İskan Kanunu’, no: 2510, 14/06/1934, Düstur, Tertip: 3, Cilt: 15, pp. 1158-1160. According to Article 12, those individuals who did not speak Turkish and were in Zone 1 and were not transferred Zone 2 must be settled in villages, towns, and districts that had a preexisting dominance of Turkish culture in order to foster assimilation. Kurds who have been resettled shall not have been allowed to constitute more than 5% of the population in the locations they have been resettled to. More than half a million Kurds have been resettled with this law from the third zone to the second zone. The law also required the resettlement of Muslim minorities such as Circassians, Albanians, and Abkhazes who were considered Muslims who had failed to fully adhere to the Turkish nation. Although these minorities shared the same faith as their Turkish counterparts, it was still considered a goal by the politicians of the Turkish Republic to bind all peoples of Turkey to become Turkish.TBMM Zabit Ceridesi, Session IV, vol. 23, addenda 189, p. 6. Due to logistical difficulties to resettle all non-Turkish population into areas with a majority of a Turkish population the Law was mainly implemented in times of Kurdish uprisings. Thracian events Yusuf Ziya Zarbun, far-right politician, who supported the resettlement law Although the Law on Settlement was expected to operate as an instrument for Turkifying the mass of non- Turkish speaking citizens, it immediately emerged as a piece of legislation which sparked riots against non-Muslims, as evidenced in the 1934 Thrace pogroms in the immediate aftermath of the law's passage. Law No. 2510 was issued on 14 June 1934, and the Thrace pogroms began just over a fortnight later, on 3 July. The incidents seeking to force out the region's non-Muslim residents first began in Çanakkale, where Jews received unsigned letters telling them to leave the city, and then escalated into an antisemitic campaign involving economic boycotts and verbal assaults as well as physical violence against the Jews living in the various provinces of Thrace.Levi, Avner. 1998. Turkiye Cumhuriyetinde Yahudiler (Jews in the Republic of Turkey), Istanbul: Iletisim Yayınları It is estimated that out of a total 15,000-20,000 Jews living in the region, more than half fled to Istanbul during and after the incidents.Karabatak, Haluk 1996 ‘Turkiye azınlık tarihine bir katkı: 1934 Trakya olayları ve Yahudiler’ (A contribution to the history of minorities in Turkey: the 1934 Thracian affair and the Jews), Tarih ve Toplum, vol. 146, pp. 68-80. However, although the Law on Settlement may well have actually provoked the incidents’ outbreak, the national authorities did not side with the attackers but immediately intervened in the incidents. After order was restored, the governors and mayors of the provinces involved were removed from office.Toprak, Zafer. 1996 ‘1934 Trakya olaylarında hukumetin ve CHP’in sorumlulugu (Government responsibility and the CHP in the 1934 Thracian incidents), Toplumsal Tarih, vol. 34, pp. 19-25. Dersim Rebellion The law played a major role in the events in Dersim in 1938 known as the Dersim rebellion. Forced resettlement was used in the depopulation of Dersim in Eastern Turkey in 1937-1938, where, according to McDowall, 40,000 people were killed.David McDowall, A modern history of the Kurds, I. B. Tauris, 2002, , p. 209. In seventeen days of the 1938 offensive alone, 7,954 persons were reported killed or caught alive.The Suppression of the Dersim Rebellion in Turkey (1937-38); p. 4 According to official Turkish reports, almost 10 percent of the entire population of Tunceli was killed. The Kurds claim that their losses were even higher. The 1934 Turkish Resettlement Law was the legal justification used for the forced resettlement. It was used primarily to target the region of Dersim as one of its first test cases, which left disastrous consequences for the local population. In a report delivered to the Republican Peoples Party (CHP) after the Dersim Rebellion, the law was described as an effective vehicle for the internal colonization of the eastern provinces and the destruction of a united Kurdish territory. It was also demanded that further resettlements should take place in order to ensure that the Turkish population will raise to 50% in the eastern provinces.

In 1733 Milward was a doctor of medicine, living in London at Queen's Square, Ormond Street; he later moved to Portugal Row, Lincoln's Inn Fields. At this period he was patron to Edmund Chapman, the writer on midwifery. On 7 July 1741 he was created by royal mandate M.D. of Cambridge as a member of Trinity College. He was admitted licentiate of the College of Physicians 30 September 1747, and fellow 30 September 1748; was censor 1752, and in the same year delivered the Harveian oration. He became Fellow of the Royal Society 21 January 1742. Milward moved to Worcester, where he died 26 August 1757. He was buried in the Knighton Chapel, Lindridge, among other members of his family. His epitaph states that he died at the age of 45. Works Milward was a scholar of the classical medical writers. His major work was his essay on Alexander Trallianus, a Greek physician of the sixth century. Milward intended this essay to be the prelude to a new edition of the text of Alexander. Another project was in his Letter to Learned Men: a complete history of British writers on medicine and surgery. He started with the papers of William Becket, bought from Edmund Curll the bookseller.

He was one of the Roman Catholic judges appointed by James II of England in his effort to transform the religious character of the Irish administration. As a judge Lynch was described in unflattering terms both by his contemporaries and by later historians. Unlike some of his judicial colleagues, he was accused of gross bias against Protestants, which may be why he was one of the few Irish judges who fled abroad after the downfall of James's cause following the Battle of the Boyne. He died in exile in France.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.307 Background He was a member of one of the oldest and most distinguished families in Galway: his father was Sir Robuck Lynch, 2nd Baronet, who was Mayor of Galway in 1638-9. His mother was Ellen, daughter of Sir Peter French.Burke's Peerage 4th Edition London 1802 Vol.1 p.123 He succeeded to the title in 1667. He entered the Middle Temple in 1664 and the King's Inn in 1674.Ball p.364 Judge From 1687 onwards a determined effort was made by the English Crown to replace the Protestants on the Irish Bench with Catholics. Lynch was chosen as a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). All of James II's Catholic judges were the object of violent attacks on the grounds that they were lacking in integrity and learning, that they were entirely subject to the will of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, and that they were \\"wretchedly poor and indigent\\".Ball p.304 The last charge was certainly not true of Lynch, but Ball notes that when he was appointed a High Court judge he had barely more than twelve years experience at the Irish Bar. James' new judges were barely in office when he was decisively defeated by William III. In the confusion of the years 1688-90 the status of the Irish High Court judges was uncertain, but most continued to act in their judicial capacity, including Lynch, who went on assize in Leinster, and was said to be working with William, who was in any case too preoccupied with other matters to give much attention to reform of the judiciary. Exile and death William III did in due course remove James' judges from office, but it seems to have been understood that no other harm would come to them: despite much hostile propaganda, few of them were guilty of any obvious abuse of office, and some of them were men of substance and good reputation. On the face of it therefore it is hard to understand why Lynch fled the country, to die in Brest in 1691. Ball believed the explanation was the discovery of a letter in which Lynch reportedly admitted that in any criminal trial where he had power to impose the death penalty he would always drive for the execution of an accused Protestant, whether they were innocent or guilty. Descendants No action was taken against his family after his death. His eldest son Robert inherited his title and estates, and his descendants, the Lynch-Blosse Baronets have held the baronetcy down to the present day. He married firstly Margaret Bourke, daughter of Theobald Bourke, 3rd Viscount Mayo and his first wife Elizabeth Talbot, and secondly Mary, daughter of Nicholas Blake. By his first wife he had three sons, Dominick, James and Sir Robert Lynch, 4th Baronet.Burke's Peerage p.123 References Baronets in the Baronetage of Ireland 1691 deaths Members of the Middle Temple People from Galway (city) Year of birth missing Barons of the Irish Exchequer ","title":"Sir Henry Lynch, 3rd Baronet"},{"id":"38607915","text":"Trevor Quachri at Dell Magazine offices Trevor Quachri (, born 1976) has been the sixth editor of Analog Science Fiction and Fact magazine since September 2012.

He opened the first professional surf shop in Manhattan Beach, California in 1950, personally hand fashioning the surfboards from wood or synthetic material. By 1960, Velzy owned five retail shops and three production facilities in California and Hawaii. He was known as \\"Hawk\\" for his keen eyesight.  Early life  Velzy was born on September 23, 1927 in Oakland, California. He had Dutch ancestry and his family was involved in wood-working, cabinetmaking or logging. His father was a woodworker and part-time life guard. Velzy began surfing as a boy and he and his father shaped boards with his grandfathers' woodworking tools. He quit school in the seventh grade. His parents tried sending him to military school, but he ran away. When he was 16 he enlisted in the Merchant Marine Corp. His tour through the Hawaiian Islands exposed him to the surf culture of the region. He then took what he learned with him and applied it to his own techniques.  Career  After serving in World War II, Velzy returned to southern California and began his career as a surfboard shaper in Manhattan Beach in the mid-1940s. It was during this period that Velzy began his research on surfboard shaping. At that time most surfboards were extremely heavy, hard to transport and not as functional as modern surfboards. Most riders used hand-me-down boards, but Velzy and his associates had the benefit of being able to shape a board from scratch or re-shape an existing board, allowing them to improve their design through trial and error. During the late 1940s shapers began using balsa wood and fiberglass for making the surfboards lighter. Velzy soon became known locally for constructing and repairing boards. His operation was initially based under the Manhattan Beach Pier, but by 1949 he had outgrown it. He borrowed money to rent a former shoe repair store nearby, setting up what is usually regarded as the first commercial surf shop. He marked his boards with a small sticker reading \\"Designed by Velzy\\". The success of the shop allowed Velzy to hone his craft and experiment with new designs. Velzy's early commercial designs were cut down from full pieces of balsa, rather than blanks, and sealed with fiberglass and resin by glasser Bev Morgan. In 1953, Velzy partnered with Hap Jacobs to open a new and larger shop in Venice, California. Together they created the narrow-nosed \\"pig\\" design, which revolutionized the sport by allowing for more dramatic turns and cut-backs. Around this time, polyurethane replaced balsa as the industry standard, making boards much lighter, below . As the industry boomed, Jacobs went out on his own in 1959, and Velzy expanded his business to several retail shops and production facilities throughout southern California. By 1960, Velzy had bought out his business partner. During this period he conceptualized promotional techniques that are standard in the modern surfing industry. These techniques include corporate sponsorship of competitive surfers and documentary films on the budding sport. He had Velzyland, a surf spot/break in Hawaii, named after him in the 50s and is still called that today.  Death  After his battle with lung cancer, Velzy died on May 26, 2005. The Dale Velzy Memorial was held at Doheny State Beach on June 14, 2005 with more than 3000 surfers going into the water in his honor.  Personal life  Velzy had five marriages, all of which ended in divorce. He was survived by his two children.

He taught, as a professor, at the Free University of Berlin from 1964 to 1969, and at the University of Vienna from 1969 until 1997, when he became professor emeritus.  Life and scientific career  Gerald Stourzh, born in Vienna in 1929, was the only child of Herbert and Helene Stourzh (née Anderle). His parents were both University graduates (the father Lutheran, the mother Catholic). Gerald himself is Lutheran. As R.G. Plaschka wrote about him in an encomium in 1991,Richard Georg Plaschka, Gerald Stourzh zum 60. Geburtstag, in: Emil Brix, Josef Leidenfrost, Thomas Fröschl, Hg., Geschichte zwischen Freiheit und Ordnung. Gerald Stourzh zum 60. Geburtstag. Styria, Graz 1991, p. 24 \\"there is something of his Lutheran ancestors, of his Lutheran heritage in him, when, confronted by a question of principle, he indicates, shrugging: Here I stand.\\" His mother, a practising gynecologist, had obtained her doctorate in 1915 when this was still quite unusual for a woman. His father had studied philosophy and made his living employed by the government of Lower Austria, but his real calling was that of a philosophical and political writer. As early as 1934, he wroteG. Stourzh, Traces of an Intellectual Journey, Introduction of: G. Stourzh, From Vienna to Chicago and Back, Univ. of Chicago Press, 2007 warningly about \\"National Bestialism\\", as he called National Socialism. After the Anschluss in 1940, the Gestapo started to investigate Herbert Stourzh, but his early death due to cancer in 1941 probably saved him from greater problems. As Gerald Stourzh wrote in 2009,G. Stourzh, Menschenrechte und Genocid, in: G. Stourzh, Spuren einer intellektuellen Reise. 3 Essays, Böhlau, Wien 2009, he owed two precious things to his parents: firstly the unconditional respect for scientific, mental pursuit in intellectual honesty, and secondly the unconditional respect for the human person, for the primacy of the single person versus super- individual entities: be it nation, or social position, or class, or people, or race. Stourzh obtained his Matura at a Vienna Gymnasium in 1947. He then studied history for eight semesters, partly at the University of Vienna, partly at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France and at the University of Birmingham in England. He was impressed by some of his teachers like Heinrich Benedikt or Hugo Hantsch, but influenced more by books (e.g., the books by Friedrich Meinecke and Josef Redlich). He obtained his degree Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Vienna in 1951 with a thesis in the field of the history of constitutions and of law, a field which remained his lifelong interest. In 1951, he received an invitation - which he gladly accepted - by the political scientist Hans J. Morgenthau whom he had met before in Austria, to join him as a research assistant at the Center for the Study of American Foreign Policy of the University of Chicago, a center recently created by Morgenthau. As the only historian at this institute, Stourzh got the task of writing a book about Benjamin Franklin. After his official graduation (in absentia) at the University of Vienna, his position was upgraded to that of a research associate in the rank of instructor and later of assistant professor. Originally hired for a year, Stourzh eventually stayed in Chicago until 1958:- as a research associate until 1953, from 1953 to 1954 as William Rainey Harper Fellow in the Department of History, from 1954 to 1956 again as a research associate at the University, from 1956 to 1957 as a research associate at the American Foundation of Political Education, and in 1958 again at the University. During this time, and with Morgenthau's permission, Stourzh also studied history and political science at the University and in the \\"Committee on Social Thought\\", for example with professors Leo Strauss (seminar on Machiavelli), Friedrich von Hayek (seminars on Tocqueville and on liberalism), Quincy Wright (international relations) and Hans Rothfels (nationality problems in central Europe). He was especially impressed by the historian William T. Hutchinson, in whose seminar he wrote an essay about Charles A. Beard that was published in 1957.It has been republished in: G. Stourzh: From Vienna to Chicago and Back. Essays on Intellectual History and Political Thought in Europe and America, University of Chicago Press, Chicago 2007. . The most important result of his Chicago years was the book Benjamin Franklin and American Foreign Policy, that was published by the University of Chicago Press in the spring of 1954, before the author's 25th birthday. In 1955, this book received the prize of the American Institute of Early American History and Culture for the best book on early American history published in 1954. In the document accompanying the prize, it says, “...you have given us his [i.e, Franklin's] wisdom where he would most want us to have it, in our relation with the rest of the world. It is fitting that you, born and educated in Austria, should have crossed the Atlantic to teach this lesson.” In 1962, Stourzh submitted the book on Franklin as a habilitation thesis at the University of Vienna. In addition to that, the Chicago years led to several publications by the American Foundation of Political Education, co-edited by Stourzh.Readings in World Politics, ed. by Robert A. Goldwin, Ralph Lerner, Gerald Stourzh, Oxford University Press, New York 1959; Readings in American Foreign Policy, ed. by Robert A. Goldwin, Ralph Lerner, Gerald Stourzh, OUP, New York 1959; Readings in Russian Foreign Policy, ed. by Robert A. Goldwin, Gerald Stourzh, Marvin Zetterbaum, OuP, New York 1959; Readings in American Democracy, ed. by Gerald Stourzh und Ralph Lerner, OUP, New York 1959; 2nd rev. edition, ed. by Gerald Stourzh, Ralph Lerner and H. C. Harlan, OUP, New York 1966. By the time Stourzh returned to Vienna in June, 1958, he had finished the first version of a book on Alexander Hamilton which was, however, not accepted for publication by the editor due to conflicting reviews. In view of his new professional duties, this book was finished only several years later, during a research stay 1966/67 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and during his stay at the Free University of Berlin. The book was published as Alexander Hamilton and the Idea of Republican Government by Stanford University Press in 1970. After rejecting an invitation for a one-year guest professorship by the University of California, Berkeley, Stourzh returned to Vienna in 1958 to organize the newly created Austrian Association for Foreign Policy and International Relations; he was its general secretary until 1962. In 1962, Stourzh passed his habilitation and became Docent for Modern History at the University of Vienna. In the same year, upon a suggestion by Bruno Kreisky, he entered Austria's Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs, where he had the desk of the Council of Europe. In 1963, he received a call from the Free University of Berlin to become a professor of Modern History, especially American history, and to head, at the same time, the section for American history at the newly founded John F. Kennedy-Institute for North American Studies of that University. He accepted the call and remained at the Free University until 1969, with an interruption due to a research stay at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton. In 1969, he became professor for Modern History at the University of Vienna, succeeding Friedrich Engel-Janosi. He has remained in that position until becoming professor emeritus in 1997. Although remaining in contact with his Anglo-American research topics due to many lectures in the United States and a research stay as an \\"Overseas Fellow\\" at Churchill College of the University of Cambridge in 1976, Stourzh's research activity now followed two lines: firstly, the problem of the nationalities within the Habsburg Monarchy, roughly between 1848 and 1918, the most important result being the book Die Gleichberechtigung der Nationalitäten in der Verfassung und Verwaltung Österreichs 1848-1918 (The equality before law of the nationalities in constitution and administration of Austria, 1848 - 1918), published in 1985;Die Gleichberechtigung der Nationalitäten in der Verfassung und Verwaltung Österreichs 1848-1918, Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien 1985. and secondly, the genesis of the Austrian State Treaty and of Austrian neutrality, and the end of allied occupation of Austria. The main result was a history of the Austrian State Treaty, that has been growing from 1975 to 2005 in altogether five editions with different titles (see Publications). Since the Nineties, continuing earlier studies, Stourzh has been studying the history of human rights in the western world. In 1967/68, he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Since a research stay in 1976, he has been Overseas Fellow of the Churchill College at the University of Cambridge. In 1962, Stourzh married Christiane Klingsland, Doctor of law, in Vienna. She was a feminist and struggled for women's rights all her life. Three daughters came from this marriage: Verena, Theresa and Katharina. Christiane died in 2004. Since 2011, he has been married to Prof. Marie-Luise Deskovic (*8.8.1937 - †10.1.2016). Gerald Stourzh is also an artist: his love of theater - that dates from his youth - brought him back on stage again: after 50 years, the same persons played the same piece (Der Zerrissene by Johann Nestroy) again, everyone acting the same part as before - this time for a caritative purpose. In his youth, as a cellist, he played chamber music with friends, and he also wrote an interpretation of the story La chute by Albert Camus.Wolfgang Mantl, Gerald Stourzh und der Rechtsstaat, in: G.

Low volume irrigation is used in agriculture for row crops, orchards, and vineyards. It is also used in horticulture in wholesale nurseries, in landscaping for civic, commercial, and private landscapes and gardens, and in the science and practice of restoration ecology and environmental remediation. The lower volume allows the water to be absorbed into slow-percolation soils such as clay, minimizing runoff. System components A wide variety of system components are used in micro-irrigation systems. Most include a filter, such as pre-filters, sand separators, media filters, screen filters, and disc filters. The level of filtration required depends on the size of the emission device and the quality of the water source. A pressure regulator or regulating valve may be required to reduce the system pressure to the desired level. Automatically or manually operated valves are required to switch from one irrigated section to another. An irrigation controller is used with automatic systems and may be needed for back flushing the filter or sand separator. Since water conservation is a main reason for choosing micro-irrigation systems, soil moisture sensors, rain shutoff sensors and sometimes even weather stations may be installed to further reduce consumption.  Emission devices = Microtubing = Microtubing is one of the oldest types of drip irrigation devices and was used in greenhouses in the 1970s. It consists of a small diameter tubing. Flow is regulated purely by the tubing's length and diameter. Weights or stakes can be attached to the end of the tubing to keep it in place. = Flow drip emitters = Low-flow irrigation systems in gardens using drip apply water through two methods: *Pre-installed small holes in small diameter tubes placed on or below the surface or * Self-cleaning emitters, in different precipitation rates, with different rate emitters on a supply line (i.e. trees-higher, perennials-lower). The Flexible supply pipe can be buried either underground or pinned on the surface. Low volume irrigation systems often use the two delivery components of drip systems to apply water through small holes in small diameter tubes placed on or below the surface. This is done instead of agricultural surface irrigation and furrow irrigation for vegetables, fruits and berries, and other high-value crops. = Adjustable drip emitters = Trickle emitters, also called \\"spider sprays,\\" come in fixed or adjustable radius shapes and diameters, and are installed directly on the flexible supply pipe or on tubing connected to it, and mounted on small stakes. Trickle emitters work well for plants with more fibrous root systems, tree and large shrub basins, and in pots and container gardens—allowing automated watering on decks and patios. Mist emitters can be used in pot, both on the ground and hanging, with humidity-fog watering for epiphytes and ferns replicating habitats. In the horticulture industry, wholesale growers and plant nurseries often use trickle emitters for and larger container stock, to automate watering. Attached to longer supply tubing on short stakes, they are easily movable to new containers when stock is moved or sold. Mist emitters are used for propagation, epiphytes, and other plants needing higher humidity. = Micro-sprinklers = Low volume micro-sprinklers may be attached to hard plastic risers or attached to standard sprinkler heads, but are more typically mounted on stakes and attached to small diameter micro-tubing connected to polyethylene tubing with a barbed connector. Some micro-sprinklers have a fixed spray or stream pattern, while others rotate. These are installed above ground and are often used for fruit and nut orchards and vineyards. These systems are expensive, even for large-scale agricultural use, and are predominantly reserved for high-value crops. = Macro-drip irrigation = High-volume, low-pressure irrigation systems for container gardening are known as Macro-Drip. A pressure regulator lowers the water pressure to under 30 pounds per square inch while a relatively large diameter hose or pipe delivers the water directly to a sprinkler head. This allows a larger volume of water to reach the flowerpot in a short amount of time, which will then be absorbed into the roots of the plant.  Sprinkler Sprinkler Irrigation sprays water onto the land. Sprinklers spread water in an equal balance. It decreases labor costs and saves up to 20%–40% in water supply. It can be applied to any soil that helps to increase crop production. A wide variety of sprinklers available in the market; one can choose carefully from the best of sprinkler systems. Ecological restoration and phytoremediation projects Low-flow irrigation systems are used on native plant habitat restoration and environmental remediation projects. The lower operating pressure can be the only choice for remote locations with wells or small storage tank water sources. It is used in temporary installations during initial establishment periods, and on the soil surface is easily removable with minimal damage to the recovering plant community. An example is its use in riparian zone restoration, and environmental remediation projects using phytoremediation and bioremediation techniques. Water conservation As municipal and agricultural water supplies become more constrained due to increasing population, droughts and climate change; city, water district, and state-province level regulations and codes are beginning to encourage or mandate reduced water consumption. Use of micro-irrigation systems on green building candidate projects can help them to accumulate points for LEED - (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification rating and awards.

It is the second book in his Roma Sub Rosa series of mystery novels set in the final decades of the Roman Republic. The main character is the Roman sleuth Gordianus the Finder. Plot summary The year is 72 BC, and the rebel gladiator Spartacus ravages the countryside of Italy, and threatens Rome itself. Gordianus the Finder is rousted out of bed in the middle of the night by a new client: Marcus Mummius, an ex- centurion and the military advisor to Marcus Licinius Crassus, the richest man in Rome. Mummius demands that Gordianus accompany him on a trireme to the Bay of Pueteoli that very night, and is unfazed by Gordianus's demand for an unusually extravagant fee. At a villa near Naples the master has been murdered, apparently by two disappeared slaves. One of the runaways wrote \\"Sparta\\" on the floor in the dead man's blood, which many take to believe part of \\"Spartacus\\", thus indicating they are partisans of the rebel. Crassus has been campaigning to be given command of an army to crush the rebellion; the murder of a relative by a slave, in Crassus' own villa, would normally be an embarrassment, but Crassus has decided to turn the event to his own advantage. By ancient Roman law, all the slaves in a household where one has committed murder shall be executed. Crassus has planned a grand arena spectacle in three days time, where all ninety-nine will be killed, in order to avenge his kinsman's murder and show the public that he is the right man to defeat Spartacus. Major Themes As with the previous novel, Roman Blood, the novel is dominated by a historical figure and his role in the politics of the latter Roman Republic. Arms focuses on Crassus, portraying him as ruthless and capable, but flawed by his thirst for glory. In spite of being fabulously wealthy, Crassus first rose to prominence as a military supporter of the dictator Sulla, and resents being famed primarily as a moneygrubber. He is particularly jealous of Pompey, and is anxious to secure the command against Spartacus before Pompey, the favored candidate for the command, returns from Spain. In his afterword, Saylor writes that this thirst for glory would later lead to Crassus' death, and his subsequent condemnation by historians. Crassus died in the disastrous Battle of Carrhae, pursuing a self-financed campaign against the Parthian Empire, for no apparent reason except to compete with Pompey's military reputation. In his subsequent novel, A Murder On The Appian Way, Gordianus explains to his daughter that Crassus' death dissolved the First Triumvirate between himself, Pompey, and Julius Caesar, exacerbating the rivalry between the remaining two and precipitating the events that led to the Roman Civil War.

The Sandcastle character was created for an NFL Network commercial. Sandcastle first appeared in a Super Bowl commercial in 2013. The commercial depicted Sanders suggesting he could still play at a level higher than the rookies in the 2013 NFL Draft and deciding to make a comeback. He dons an afro, assumes the impromptu alias \\"Leon Sandcastle\\" and enters the draft, going through the full NFL Scouting Combine. For action shots, Ball State cornerback Andre Dawson served as the stunt double. The commercial features Sandcastle being drafted 1st overall in the draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. A voiceover then instructs viewers to watch NFL Network for offseason and draft coverage, noting in deadpan at the end that \\"the next rookie sensation probably won't be Leon Sandcastle.\\" Despite not being an actual prospect for the 2013 NFL Draft, several combine videos have been created. The most prominent of these videos is Sandcastle's \\"4.2 40 yard dash.\\" The NFL also created a \\"Combine Profile\\" for Sandcastle, as they do with actual prospects. In Rich Eisen's 2013 annual 'Run Rich Run' event, Sandcastle appeared giving tips to Eisen. Sandcastle's combine profile reveals that Sandcastle attended Primetime University. The commercial had a positive social media response as \\"Leon Sandcastle\\" was trending on Twitter worldwide, shortly after the commercial's airing. Sandcastle was also put into Madden NFL 13 as a card in the 'Ultimate Team' game mode. For April Fools' Day, 2013, NFL.com reported that Sandcastle would be the Chiefs' first overall selection. The character developed marketing value and continued to appear in headlines, such as a fake endorsement deal with Under Armour and continued to make other appearance at NFL events. Sandcastle also had football trading cards produced and inserted into products by Topps and Panini America.

Evroul, founded the church at this sight in the densely forested area of Ouche in Normandy. The first buildings were wattle huts but he eventually built a monastery on the spot.

See: Alban Butler; Paul Burns, Butler's lives of the saints / December (Turnbridge Wells, UK: Burns & Oates, 2000), p. 230. Shortly afterwards, his two nephews, Hugh de Grandmesnil and his younger brother Robert de Grandmesnil wanted to build a monastery but the site they chose was not well suited for a religious community. William advised his nephews to work with him to restore the ancient abbey of Saint Evroul and, with generous endowments from many of the fitz Giroie family, it was completed in 1050.K.S.B.

While this was a victory for William I Talvas, it also seems to have caused him great resentment against William fitz Giroie. William Talvas invited his greatest vassal to his second wedding and although warned by his brother Ralph not to go, William fitz Giroie attended the festivities not suspecting he would be seized and thrown in prison.

French citizens of Asian descent primarily have ancestry from the former French colonies in Asia (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia) or China. Other Asian ethnic groups found in France include South Asians, Japanese and Koreans. While they are Asian by definition, Middle Easterners are often considered to be a separate category from that of Asian in France because of large differences in culture and ethnic composition from the rest of the Asian continent as well as racial relationships between the group and general French populace. By Country=Cambodians= The population of ethnic Khmers in France as of 2011 is estimated to be about 80,000, making the community one of the largest in the Cambodian diaspora. The Cambodian population in France has had a presence in the country dating to well before the Vietnam War and subsequent Indochina refugee crisis, unlike counterpart communities in North America and Australia. Early Cambodian immigration to France began in the latter half of the 19th century, when Cambodia became a French protectorate. The first migrants largely consisted of students and workers belonging to the country's elite class.Pierre Montagnon, La France coloniale, tome 1, Pygmalion-Gérard Watelet, 1988 While most Cambodians arrived as refugees as a result of Indochina's heavy turmoil during the latter half of the 20th century, their large-scale arrival was later than other Indochinese immigrants. Although a few Cambodians were able to flee from the Khmer Rouge takeover in 1975 with French assistance, a much larger influx arrived in the 1980s following the regime collapse and end of the Cambodian genocide. =Chinese= Chinese form the largest Asian group in France, with a population of roughly 600,000 as of 2010. The first Chinese migrants to France consisted of traders in the leather and Chinese ceramics trade originating from the Wenzhou region during the early 1900s. During World War I, a few thousand Chinese laborers were recruited by the French Empire to help with war efforts in Metropolitan France, doing tasks such as working at munitions depots or ports and repairing railways and roads. A small number remained in France after the war ended, settling largely in the Chinese quarter of Paris established earlier by the Wenzhounese merchants, forming the basis of the Chinese community in France. Chinese immigration to France continued as a trickle during the 1930s and 1940s, with some tradesmen and students arriving in the country, primarily to Paris. A much larger inflow of ethnic Chinese arrived in France after the end of the Vietnam War and the heavy persecution of ethnic Chinese in Vietnam and Cambodia by the new communist government in 1975, along with a larger influx of immigrants from the Wenzhou region of China.Straits Times, 18 September 1978, p. 2 The 13th arrondissement of Paris hosts Paris' Quartier Asiatique, the largest and most important community for the city's Asian population. While originally an ethnic Vietnamese quarter, Chinese have become the largest Asian and ethnic group in the neighborhood following the former community's assimilation into French society. The Belleville neighborhood of Paris also hosts an important Chinese community, as does the historical Chinese quarter founded by Wenzhounese merchants in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris. =FilipinosIndiansJapaneseKoreansLaotians= The number of ethnic Laotians in France was estimated to be 200,000 as of 2017. The Laotian community in France is the most established overseas Laotian community outside Southeast Asia, having had a presence in the country since the late 19th century, when Laos became a French protectorate. Under French rule, a number of Laotian students and workers arrived in France, with some resettling permanently. A much larger number of Laotians arrived in France following the end of the Laotian Civil War (a front of the greater Vietnam War) and the communist takeover of their homeland. The Laotian community is highly integrated into French society, with high average rates of educational and economic achievement, especially among the generations of French-born Lao.La jeunesse lao de France, quelle identité?

As of 2017, the population of the community was estimated to be about 400,000, the second largest overseas Vietnamese population outside Asia. During the colonial period, there was a significant representation of Vietnamese students in France, as well as professional and blue-collar workers, with a large number settling permanently. Following Vietnam's independence, a number of Vietnamese loyal to the colonial government also emigrated to France. However, the largest influx of Vietnamese people arrived in France as refugees after the Fall of Saigon and end of the Vietnam War in 1975.La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier (in French) The Vietnamese community in France is the most successful among overseas Vietnamese communities, having a high level of both integration and success in academics and income.

It is denoted by k[V]. If V is finite dimensional and is viewed as an algebraic variety, then k[V] is precisely the coordinate ring of V. The explicit definition of the ring can be given as follows. If k[t_1, \\\\dots, t_n] is a polynomial ring, then we can view t_i as coordinate functions on k^n; i.e., t_i(x) = x_i when x = (x_1, \\\\dots, x_n). This suggests the following: given a vector space V, let k[V] be the commutative k-algebra generated by the dual space V^*, which is a subring of the ring of all functions V \\\\to k. If we fix a basis for V and write t_i for its dual basis, then k[V] consists of polynomials in t_i. If k is infinite, then k[V] is the symmetric algebra of the dual space V^*. In applications, one also defines k[V] when V is defined over some subfield of k (e.g., k is the complex field and V is a real vector space.) The same definition still applies. Throughout the article, for simplicity, the base field k is assumed to be infinite.  Relation with polynomial ring  Let A=K[x] be the set of all polynomials over a field K and B be the set of all polynomial functions in one variable over K. Both A and B are algebras over K given by the standard multiplication and addition of polynomials and functions. We can map each f in A to \\\\hat{f} in B by the rule \\\\hat{f}(t) = f(t). A routine check shows that the mapping f \\\\mapsto \\\\hat{f} is a homomorphism of the algebras A and B. This homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if K is an infinite field. For example, if K is a finite field then let p(x) = \\\\prod\\\\limits_{t \\\\in K} (x-t). p is a nonzero polynomial in K[x], however p(t) = 0 for all t in K, so \\\\hat{p} = 0 is the zero function and our homomorphism is not an isomorphism (and, actually, the algebras are not isomorphic, since the algebra of polynomials is infinite while that of polynomial functions is finite). If K is infinite then choose a polynomial f such that \\\\hat{f} = 0. We want to show this implies that f = 0. Let \\\\deg f = n and let t_0,t_1,\\\\dots,t_n be n+1 distinct elements of K. Then f(t_i) = 0 for 0 \\\\le i \\\\le n and by Lagrange interpolation we have f = 0. Hence the mapping f \\\\mapsto \\\\hat{f} is injective. Since this mapping is clearly surjective, it is bijective and thus an algebra isomorphism of A and B.  Symmetric multilinear maps  Let k be an infinite field of characteristic zero (or at least very large) and V a finite-dimensional vector space. Let S^q(V) denote the vector space of multilinear functionals \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda: \\\\prod_1^q V \\\\to k that are symmetric; \\\\lambda(v_1, \\\\dots, v_q) is the same for all permutations of v_i's. Any λ in S^q(V) gives rise to a homogeneous polynomial function f of degree q: we just let f(v) = \\\\lambda(v, \\\\dots, v). To see that f is a polynomial function, choose a basis e_i, \\\\, 1 \\\\le i \\\\le n of V and t_i its dual. Then :\\\\lambda(v_1, \\\\dots, v_q) = \\\\sum_{i_1, \\\\dots, i_q = 1}^n \\\\lambda(e_{i_1}, \\\\dots, e_{i_q}) t_{i_1}(v_1) \\\\cdots t_{i_q}(v_q), which implies f is a polynomial in the ti's. Thus, there is a well-defined linear map: :\\\\phi: S^q(V) \\\\to k[V]_q, \\\\, \\\\phi(\\\\lambda)(v) = \\\\lambda(v, \\\\cdots, v). We show it is an isomorphism. Choosing a basis as before, any homogeneous polynomial function f of degree q can be written as: :f = \\\\sum_{i_1, \\\\dots, i_q = 1}^n a_{i_1 \\\\cdots i_q} t_{i_1} \\\\cdots t_{i_q} where a_{i_1 \\\\cdots i_q} are symmetric in i_1, \\\\dots, i_q. Let :\\\\psi(f)(v_1, \\\\dots, v_q) = \\\\sum_{i_1, \\\\cdots, i_q = 1}^n a_{i_1 \\\\cdots i_q} t_{i_1}(v_1) \\\\cdots t_{i_q}(v_q). Clearly, \\\\phi\\\\circ\\\\psi is the identity; in particular, φ is surjective. To see φ is injective, suppose φ(λ) = 0. Consider :\\\\phi(\\\\lambda)(t_1 v_1 + \\\\cdots + t_q v_q) = \\\\lambda(t_1 v_1 + \\\\cdots + t_q v_q, ..., t_1 v_1 + \\\\cdots + t_q v_q), which is zero. The coefficient of t1t2 … tq in the above expression is q! times λ(v1, …, vq); it follows that λ = 0. Note: φ is independent of a choice of basis; so the above proof shows that ψ is also independent of a basis, the fact not a priori obvious. Example: A bilinear functional gives rise to a quadratic form in a unique way and any quadratic form arises in this way.  Taylor series expansion  Given a smooth function, locally, one can get a partial derivative of the function from its Taylor series expansion and, conversely, one can recover the function from the series expansion. This fact continues to hold for polynomials functions on a vector space. If f is in k[V], then we write: for x, y in V, :f(x + y) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} g_n(x, y) where gn(x, y) are homogeneous of degree n in y, and only finitely many of them are nonzero. We then let :(P_y f)(x) = g_1(x, y), resulting in the linear endomorphism Py of k[V]. It is called the polarization operator. We then have, as promised: Proof: We first note that (Py f) (x) is the coefficient of t in f(x + t y); in other words, since g0(x, y) = g0(x, 0) = f(x), :P_y f (x) = \\\\left . {d \\\\over dt} \\\\right |_{t=0} f(x + ty) where the right-hand side is, by definition, :\\\\left . {f(x+ty) - f(x) \\\\over t} \\\\right |_{t=0}. The theorem follows from this. For example, for n = 2, we have: :P_y^2 f (x) = \\\\left . {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t_1} \\\\right |_{t_1=0} P_y f(x + t_1 y) = \\\\left . {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t_1} \\\\right |_{t_1=0} \\\\left . {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t_2} \\\\right |_{t_2=0} f(x + (t_1 + t_2) y) = 2! g_2(x, y). The general case is similar. \\\\square Operator product algebra When the polynomials are valued not over a field k, but over some algebra, then one may define additional structure. Thus, for example, one may consider the ring of functions over GL(n,m), instead of for k = GL(1,m). In this case, one may impose an additional axiom. The operator product algebra is an associative algebra of the form :A^i(x)B^j(y) = \\\\sum_k f^{ij}_k (x,y,z) C^k(z) The structure constants f^{ij}_k (x,y,z) are required to be single-valued functions, rather than sections of some vector bundle. The fields (or operators) A^i(x) are required to span the ring of functions. In practical calculations, it is usually required that the sums be analytic within some radius of convergence; typically with a radius of convergence of |x-y|. Thus, the ring of functions can be taken to be the ring of polynomial functions. The above can be considered to be an additional requirement imposed on the ring; it is sometimes called the bootstrap. In physics, a special case of the operator product algebra is known as the operator product expansion.

It encompasses more than , with of saltwater shoreline along Boundary Bay. In 2008, Whatcom County acquired this property with the assistance of The Nature Conservancy and Whatcom Land Trust. Major goals in the planning process for the park include the preservation of the site's natural and cultural heritage and public access. Proposed improvements include a trailhead with parking and restrooms, trails through forested uplands, viewpoints and shoreline access. Ecology and geology Lily Point encompasses over 275 acres of forested upland bluffs, beaches, and rich tidelands. It is known locally for its many forest, cliff- hugging and beach access trails. Lily Point hosts a dynamic assembly of ecological processes - reefs and tidelands swept by nutrient filled currents, riparian forests providing shade, perches, and insects to the coastal environment, and eroding cliffs supplying sand and gravel for spawning substrate and beach replenishment. These processes are essential to the health of Puget Sound - the Orca that patrol the Straights of Georgia, salmon that skirt Lily Point on their way to the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers, bald eagles that scour the beach, great blue herons that stalk the tidelands, and waterfowl and shore birds that visit Boundary Bay. At a low tide in June, a delegation from the Land Trust saw nearly 100 eagles on the beach at Lily Point. Lily Point's strategic location, its relatively large undeveloped and natural shoreline, and its combination of mature upland forests, riparian vegetation, feeder cliffs, and ecologically abundant tidelands give this project regional and international significance. Providing spawning substrate for forage fish utilized by juvenile Chinook salmon, Lily Point is identified as a priority protection site in the Puget Sound Action Team Recovery Plan. The Nature Conservancy includes Lily Point as \\"Priority Conservation Area\\" because of the site's exceptional and regionally important ecological values. Boundary Bay, whose ecological health is directly linked to Lily Point, is recognized as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International, as a Western Hemispheric Shorebird Reserve Network Site (WHSRN), and as a U.N. Wetland of International Importance especially for Waterfowl (RAMSAR Site). History Point Roberts formed from the sand and gravel outwash of retreating glaciers 15,000 years ago. The highest reach of this glacial deposit, some 200 feet above the sea at the southeast corner of Point Roberts, is Lily Point, or, in Native Salish language Chelhtenem, \\"hang salmon for drying.\\" Lily Point was the most important Native reef net fishery and one of the most significant salmon fisheries of the Central Coast Salish. In 1889, 16 Native reef nets were in operation and a single net would catch as many as 2,000 fish a day. A newspaper reported in 1881 that three reef nets took 10,000 fish in six hours. For many centuries Chelhtenem was a center of traditional salmon culture and a place of great spiritual power for Native Peoples. The First Salmon Ceremony honored the returning salmon and directed them into the reef nets. The bones of the first fish were carefully returned to the sea where the fish regained its form and told other salmon how well it had been treated, thus allowing the capture of other fish and insuring a return the following year. =19th and 20th centuries= In the late 19th century, non-Indian fish traps displaced traditional reef nets. Alaska Packers purchased a year old cannery at Lily Point in 1884. The cannery was abandoned in 1917, leaving pilings and debris still visible today. Chelhtenem was added to the National Register of Historical Places in 1994 as a site of National Cultural, Traditional and Spiritual Significance, the second place in Washington State receiving such a designation. =Present= After Welsh Development, Inc. acquired Lily Point, Whatcom County approved a major development for condominiums, a golf course, 74 residential lots, and a regional recreational resort on properties including Lily Point. For reasons unknown, the developer allowed the permits to expire in 2003 without beginning construction. It was placed back on the market and eventually purchased again in 2008 with plans to turn it into a park and marine reserve. The site is known for numerous eagles, heron, and loons. In addition, some of the largest migratory salmon runs have come to this point as they make passage to the Fraser River. In addition, the area is abundant in clams and crabs, and features a rich marine ecosystem. Indeed, Chelhtenem has changed little in historic period; it still reflects the landforms, vegetation, and water resources that attracted and sustained the original inhabitants and their descendants.

L. \\"Mike\\" Donnet, (1 April 1917– 31 July 2013) was a Belgian pilot who served in the Belgian Army and British Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. He shot down four enemy aircraft confirmed, and achieved the RAF rank of wing commander. After the war, he returned to the Belgian Air Force, and held several important commands before retiring in 1975. Second World War On 1 March 1938, he joined the Aviation Militaire Belge (Belgian Army Air Force). On 26 March 1939, he was commissioned as sergeant-pilot, and on 1 March 1940 he signed for a further three years' service. Donnet flew Renard R.31 reconnaissance aircraft with the 9/V/1Aé (9th Escadrille of the First Aviation Regiment) at Bierset. After the German invasion on 10 May 1940, he flew sorties during the 18-day campaign. On 1 June 1940, he was taken POW (Prisoner of war) by German ground forces when Belgium capitulated, and he was held in camps in Germany and France. On 10 January 1941, he was repatriated to Belgium. =Flight to freedom= A replica of SV-4B OO-ATD at the Musée Royal de l'Armée After release in German-occupied Belgium, he met his former colleague sergeant-pilot Léon Divoy, and they briefly planned to build an aircraft with which to escape to England. Their search for a propeller suggested that there was one still attached to a complete stored aeroplane. That proved to be a Stampe et Vertongen SV-4B (OO-ATD) which was owned by Baron Thierry d'Huart. It was stored in a locked small hangar at his chateau at Terbloc, where German troops were stationed. With the help of many trusted friends and the Belgian Resistance, Donnet and Divoy spent four months preparing their plan. It involved bicycle rides of three hours from Stockel to Terbloc and return at night, improvisation of flying instruments, obtaining scarce petrol, and testing systems. Divoy had won the toss to pilot the SV-4B, but Donnet had access to dual controls to assist Divoy. On 19 May 1941, they planned to fly, but the engine failed to start, and they abandoned that first attempt. More work delayed the second attempt, but finally at 0245 on 5 July 1941, they took off and headed approximately WNW towards the coast. After narrowly avoiding a searchlight, the engine stopped, but eventually picked up again. After about two hours' flying, they sighted land during sunrise, but the geography did not match the intended destination in Kent. The engine started running roughly, so they landed at the nearest suitable landing area in a field. They quickly confirmed that they were in England, and headed on foot towards the nearest police station that turned out to be at Thorpe-le- Soken, near Clacton, Essex. The Stampe SV-4B was later camouflaged and marked 'J7777', then impressed into service with No. 24 Sqn and then No. 510 Sqn, finally marked MX457 and nominally based at RAF Hendon. In 1945, it was returned to its owner Thierry d'Huart in Belgium.Donnet 1974OO-ATD crashed in June 1960, but a replica is now displayed with inaccurate markings at the Musée Royal de l'Armée in Brussels. =RAF service= On 26 July 1941, Donnet was accepted by the RAF Volunteer Reserve. On 27 July 1941, with Léon Divoy, he joined No. 61 OTU (Operational Training Unit) at RAF Heston where as a Pilot Officer he converted to operation of Spitfires. On 7 September 1941, he was briefly posted to No. 143 Squadron RAF. No. 64 Squadron Spitfire VBs of 64 Sqn at Hornchurch On 15 September 1941, he was posted to 64 Sqn at RAF Turnhouse, flying Spitfire Mk.IIs on patrols and escorting shipping convoys in the North Sea, including some detachments to RAF Drem. On 17 November 1941, the squadron relocated to RAF Hornchurch with Spitfire Mk. Vs. His time there was spent on dogfighting exercises, escort for bomber missions, ground attacks on occupied Belgian airfields, and combat against Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. In April 1942, the squadron moved to RAF Rochford (Southend). On 4 April, he saw his friend Léon Divoy collide with another Spitfire during the same mission; Divoy baled out, and spent the rest of the war as a POW.After the war, Léon Divoy (18 February 1916 – 7 February 1977) was a commercial pilot with Sabena. Donnet flew further missions against Fw 190s from RAF Hornchurch, and in July 1942 he converted to Spitfire Mk. IXs. On 21 July 1942, he was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre, and soon afterwards achieved his first confirmed kill against a Fw 190. On 19 August 1942, he took part in escorting USAAF B-17s during the Dieppe Raid. On 2 September 1942, he was assigned to take over command of 'A' flight of 64 Squadron. On 19 February 1943, he was awarded the DFC (UK), after he had completed 100 sorties. On 26 March 1943, he was promoted to Acting Squadron Leader of 64 Squadron, flying Spitfire Mk. Vs from RAF Ayr, for escort duties and ship deck-landing training. On 7 August 1943, the squadron moved to RAF Friston. On 5 November 1943, he was posted to a Fighter Leaders' course, and then on 19 November 1943 to No. 52 OTU.Halley 1980 No. 350 Squadron A Spitfire XIV of 350 Sqn at Lympne On 23 March 1944 Donnet was posted as Squadron Leader of No. 350 Squadron (composed of Belgian pilots), flying Spitfire IXs from RAF Peterhead, then in April from RAF Friston. On 6 June 1944, during the Normandy landings (D-day), he led the squadron in providing continuous fighter cover over the beachhead. In July 1944, the squadron moved to RAF Westhampnett. On 8 August 1944, he moved with the squadron to RAF Hawkinge, flying Spitfire XIVs against V-1 flying bombs. On 3 September 1944, he learned that Belgium had been liberated, and next day he led a celebratory formation of 12 Spitfires over Brussels. On 29 September 1944, the squadron moved to RAF Lympne. Wing commander On 23 October 1944, he was posted as Wing Commander of No. 132 Sqn and No. 441 Sqn at RAF Hawkinge, flying Spitfire IXs. In February 1945, he was posted as Wing Commander of three RAF squadrons, No. 64 Sqn, No. 126 Sqn and No. 234 Sqn at RAF Bentwaters, flying Mustang IIIs on bomber escort duties. In August 1945, he studied at the RAF Staff College. On 21 March 1945, he was posted to RAF Fersfield with No. 64 Sqn and No. 132 Sqn, for escort duties with Mosquitos of No. 140 Wing on Operation Carthage over Copenhagen. During his war period, Donnet flew 375 missions, shot down four enemy aircraft confirmed, and damaged at least another five. Postwar After the war, he was posted to the Belgian Ministry of Defense to reorganise the Belgian Air Force, and to update it with aircraft such as Gloster Meteor and Republic F-84. He then led the HQ of No. 83 Group RAF, he became commander of Allied Air Forces Central Europe and then Commander of HQ of RAF Second Tactical Air Force. He took presidency of the direction committee of project NADGE (Integrated NATO Air Defense System) and afterwards became Military Attaché at the Belgian Embassy in London. He was a member of the Military committee of NATO. On 1 July 1975, he retired from the Belgian Air Force as a lieutenant general, having flown over 5,000 hours.

Stevens Cooperative House.John Hopper, A Brief History of the ICC -- Part 1, Inter-Cooperative Council http://www.icc.coop/story/history/ The house, which stood on Forest Avenue south of Hill Street in Ann Arbor, was destroyed on May 25, 2004, by a fire.Michigan Daily, \\"Blaze reduces co-op to rubble,\\" May 25, 2004 http://www.michigandaily.com/content/blaze-reduces-co-op-rubbleArborwiki, A.K. Stevens Cooperative House http://arborwiki.org/A.K._Stevens_Cooperative_House During the 1930s and 1940s, Stevens was instrumental in a University of Michigan Department of English effort to link newly improved curricula and the preparation of pupils in Michigan high schools who wished to concentrate in these programs. The program included accreditation visits from the Bureau of School Services, offering of extension courses to teachers, and coordination with teachers’ associations. Also during the 1940s, Stevens was program supervisor of the Workers Educational Service, an experimental program for adults subsidized by the State of Michigan. The program’s purpose was to serve persons who had received little educational training, but who wished to become informed about economics, social philosophies, collective bargaining, labor relations, and similar topics, and who were eager to improve their skills in public speaking and debate, the managing of meetings, and union organization.Workers Education Service, University of Michigan archival material records, 1944–1949, Albert K Stevens, program supervisor. Edition/Format: Files, including correspondence, reports, handbills, reading lists, and history and analysis of the program. He also served as editor of the newsletter of the Michigan Council of Teachers of English, for which he became the first executive secretary. Completing his academic studies, in 1950 he received his PhD and in 1954 became an associate professor. He was promoted to professor in 1962. Stevens employed the Bible as a critical educational tool, discussing its literary, social, historical, and religious aspects to reach students with widely differing cultural backgrounds, beliefs, and degrees of sophistication. Personal life Stevens was married to Angelyn (Annagien Bouwsma) Stevens on June 19, 1925, after they met at Calvin College. Angelyn continued to study philosophy at the University of Michigan after having taken all the philosophy courses Calvin College had to offer, and convinced A.K. to come to Ann Arbor to experience a more engaging intellectual environment, a move that led to A.K.'s academic career at the University. Angelyn became a graduate student in philosophy at Michigan during Professor Stevens' early years in the University's English Department. The couple started a lifetime friendship with the Anglo-American poet W. H. Auden when he was a visiting instructor at the University in the early 1940s.Chapman, Robert L. \\"Auden in Ann Arbor.\\" Michigan quarterly review. Volume XVII, Issue: 4, Fall 1978, pp. 507-520 Auden dedicated the poem \\"Mundus Et Infans\\" to the couple.Auden, W.H. \\"Mundus Et Infans.\\" Selected Poems. New York: Vintage Books, 1979. When Auden became a U.S. citizen, Stevens was his sponsor. Stevens and his wife died together in an automobile accident in September, 1984. They were survived by five children: F. Bradley Stevens, Grace TerMaat, Mary Hathaway, Wystan Auden Stevens and Eve Heidtmann, and fourteen grandchildren.

Its first slogan was RFM, la radio couleur (RFM, the color radio), with a logo representing the 3 letters R F M in the form of green, yellow and pink. It was created by the DMM France agency led by Jean-François Minne. In March 1989, RFM's founder Patrick Meyer decided to hand over the station to the English group Crown Communication, Andrew Manderstam then became the CEO and recruited Frédéric Schlesinger to ensure national development of the network. In September 1994, RFM started a new format: The best French and International Oldies from the 1960s to the 1990s. A new logo and slogan (\\"RFM, La radio en or\\") was created. On September 1999, RFM TV was launched on cable and satellite. The chain, which declined the radio programming, was carried out under license by the AB Groupe, which later stopped broadcasting since March 2005 because Lagardère declined to renew its license agreement with AB.

Eddy and the History of Christian Science (1909) is a highly critical account of the life of Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, and the early history of the Christian Science church in 19th-century New England. Largely ghostwritten by the novelist Willa Cather, it was published as a book in November 1909 in New York by Doubleday, Page & Company.Bohlke 1982, 288–294.Jewell and Stout 2014, 97. The original byline was that of a journalist, Georgine Milmine, but it later emerged that Cather was the principal author.Stouck 1993a, xv–xviii. The first major examination of Eddy's life and work, the material initially appeared in McClure's magazine in 14 installments between January 1907 and June 1908,Milmine 1907–1908. when Eddy was 85 years old, preceded in December 1906 by a six-page editorial announcing the series as \\"probably as near absolute accuracy as history ever gets\\".McClure's, December 1906, 216. In the early 20th century, Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in America,Stark 1998, 190. and in the view of McClure's, Eddy was the most powerful woman in the country. The McClure's eyewitness accounts and affidavits became key primary sources for practically all independent accounts of the church's early history. The magazine's publisher and editor-in-chief, S. S. McClure, assigned five writers to work on the articles: Willa Cather, winner of the 1923 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, who had joined McClure's as an editor in 1906; Georgine Milmine, a freelance reporter who originally brought some of the research to McClure's; Will Irwin, McClure's managing editor; staff writer Burton J. Hendrick, winner of a Pulitzer Prize in 1921, 1923 and 1929; staff writer Mark Sullivan; and, briefly, the journalist Ida Tarbell.Gill 1998, 565; more in Sergeant 1953, 54–56, and Lyon 1963, 299. The New York Times wrote in 1910 that the book's evidence against \\"Eddyism\\" was \\"unanswerable and conclusive\\". Christian Scientists reacted strongly to it; there were reports of Scientists buying all available copies and stealing it from libraries.Streissguth 2011, 42. The Christian Science church purchased the manuscript, and soon the book was out of print. It was republished by Baker Book House in 1971 after its copyright had expired, and again in 1993 by the University of Nebraska Press, this time naming both Cather and Milmine as authors. David Stouck, in his introduction to the University of Nebraska Press edition, wrote that Cather's portrayal of Eddy \\"contains some of the finest portrait sketches and reflections on human nature that Willa Cather would ever write\\". Christian Science The First Church of Christ, Scientist, Boston, MA Eddy and 26 followers founded the Christian Science church in 1879 in Boston, Massachusetts,Eddy 1908, 17–18; Stark 1998, 189. following the publication of her book Science and Health (1875). In the book Eddy argued that disease is a mental error rather than a physical disorder, and that it should be treated not by medicine but by a form of silent prayer that corrects the mistaken beliefs. Her ideas were not new, she said; on the contrary, the church sought to \\"reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing\\".Peters 2007, 92; Wilson 1961, 125; Eddy 1908, 17. At a time when medical practice was in its infancy, and patients often fared better if left alone, the Christian Science message was a welcome one.Stark 1998, 197–198. In 1882 Eddy set up the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston, where, for $300 for a 12-lesson course, she and her students taught mostly women how to become Christian Science practitioners, licensed to offer Christian Science prayer to the sick.Bates and Dittemore 1932, 258, 274. The college made Eddy a wealthy woman; when she died in December 1910 her estate was valued at $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ).The New York Times, December 15, 1910. Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States. The church had 27 members in 1879; 65,717 in 1906 when McClure's began its research; and 268,915 at its height in 1936.Stark 1998, 189–191. In 1890 there were just seven Christian Science churches in the US; by 1910 there were 1,104.Cunningham 1967, 892. Construction of the mother church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, was completed in Boston in December 1894, and in 1906 the Mother Church Extension, rising 224 ft and accommodating nearly 5,000, was built at a cost of $2 million (equivalent to $ million in ), reportedly paid by Christian Scientists around the world.Classe 2013, 58. Art historian Paul Ivey writes that, for many, the building \\"visibly declared that Christian Science had, indeed, arrived as a major force in American religious life\\".Ivey 1999, 73. The religion entered a period of continuous decline after World War II for various reasons, chiefly the improvement in medical science, the availability of more jobs for women outside the home,Stark 1998, 211–212. and the tendency of those raised within the religion to leave it.Stark 1998, 202, 208. In 2009 it was estimated that there were under 50,000 Christian Scientists in the US.Prothero and Callahan 2017, 165. Publication=McClure's articles= The McClure's articles were published in 14 installments between January 1907 and June 1908, under Georgine Milmine's byline, as \\"Mary Baker G. Eddy: The Story of Her Life and the History of Christian Science\\". The series was preceded by a seven-page editorial in December 1906, outlining the difficulties of the investigation and explaining why it was being published.McClure's, December 1906. The editorial got the series off to an unfortunate start by reproducing a photograph that purported to be of Eddy but was in fact of someone else.Eddy 1907. Referring to Christian Science as a cult based on a \\"hazy and obscure\\" book, it continued: \\"A church which has doubled its membership in five years, which draws its believers mostly from the rich and respectable ... and which has just paid for the most costly church building in New England—to the worldly, this is no longer a joke\\": > In 1875 no one living outside of two or three back streets of Lynn had heard > of Christian Science. Now, the very name is a catch phrase. In those early > days the leader and teacher paid out half of her ten dollars a week to hire > a hall, patching out the rest of her living with precarious fees as an > instructor in mental healing; now, she is one of the richest women in the > United States. She is more than that—she is the most powerful American > woman.McClure's, December 1906, 211. The editorial accused the church of a lack of transparency: \\"The Christian Science mind is unfriendly to independent investigation. It presupposes that anything even slightly unfavorable to Mrs. Eddy or to Christian Science is deliberate falsehood.\\"McClure's, December 1906, 217. =Synopsis= Mary Baker Eddy The book's criticism of Eddy is considerable. She is portrayed as greedy, uneducated and deceitful, someone who regularly revised her life story and was interested only in making money. The authors produce witness statements from Eddy's childhood in Bow, New Hampshire, alleging that she engaged in repeated fainting spells to gain attention, particularly from her father, and that, as an adult, she developed a habit of appearing to be seriously ill only to recover quickly. Eddy was widowed when she was 22 years old and pregnant, after which she returned to live in her father's home. Her son was raised there for the first few years of his life, looked after by domestic staff because of Eddy's poor health. The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy alleges that she allowed him to be adopted when he was four. According to Eddy, she was unable to prevent the adoption. Women in the United States at the time could not be their own children's guardians, per the legal doctrine of coverture. Her next two marriages, lifelong poor health, and the numerous legal actions in which she was involved, are examined in detail—including lawsuits she initiated against her students; a criminal case in which her third husband was accused of conspiring to murder one of them (an allegation never proven); her belief that her former students killed her third husband by using \\"mental malpractice\\"; and her legal adoption of a 41-year-old homeopath when she was 67. The authors allege that Eddy's major work, Science and Health, which became Christian Science's main religious text, borrowed heavily from the work of Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, a New England faith healer. Quimby had treated Eddy in the years before his death and had given her some of his unpublished notes. The series and book discuss the rewrites of Science and Health by her editor James Henry Wiggin,Milmine, October 1907, 695–699. who edited the book from the 16th edition in 1886 until the 50th in 1891, including the 22 editions that appeared between 1886 and 1888.Bates and Dittemore 1932, 270–273, 304; Gottschalk 1973, 42. In a letter to a friend in December 1889, published by McClure's in October 1907, Wiggin alleged that Eddy's preference that her writing remain unclear was one of the \\"tricks of the trade\\".Milmine, October 1907, 699. She is an \\"awfully (I use the word advisedly) smart woman,\\" he wrote, \\"acute, shrewd, but not well read, nor in way learned\\".Milmine, October 1907, 698–699. There is nothing to really understand in 'Science and Health'\\", he continued, \\"except that God is all, and yet there is no God in matter! What they fail to explain is, the origin of the idea of matter, or sin. They say it comes from mortal mind, and that mortal mind is not divinely created, in fact, has no existence ... that matter and disease are like dreams ... No, Swedenborg, and all other such writers, are sealed books to [Mrs. Eddy]. She cannot understand such utterances, and never could, but dollars and cents she understands thoroughly.\\"Cather and Milmine 1909, 336–338. Wiggin emphasized that she was a practical woman. She advised her students, \\"Call a surgeon in surgical cases.\\" One asked: \\"What if I find a breech presentation in childbirth?\\" She replied: \\"You will not, if you are in Christian Science.\\" The student asked again: \\"But if I do?\\" Eddy advised: \\"Then send for the nearest regular practitioner!\\" Wiggin concluded: \\"You see, Mrs. Eddy is nobody's fool.\\"Cather and Milmine 1909, 339. Authorship=Editorial team= S. S. McClure, McClure's publisher and editor-in-chief Born in Ontario, Canada, Georgine Milmine had worked for the Syracuse Herald in New York before joining McClure's as a researcher. She had been collecting material about Eddy for years—newspaper articles from the 1880s, court records, and a first edition of Science and Health, all of which were hard to obtain—but lacked the resources to check and write it up herself, so she sold it to McClure's.Stouck 1993, xv. Apparently when McClure's was sold, the new publisher threw away the research, including the first edition. S. S. McClure assigned five writers to the story: Milmine, Willa Cather, Burton J. Hendrick, political columnist Mark Sullivan, and Will Irwin. When the series was suggested, the journalist Ida Tarbell was also involved. Cather had started working at McClure's as a fiction editor in 1906 when she was 32 years; she worked there until 1912, for most of the time as managing editor. Cather reportedly spent from December 1906 until May 1908 in Boston, checking the sources and writing up the research.Porter 2010, 71.Bohlke 1982, 289. The journalist Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant, a friend of Cather's, wrote in 1953 that S. S. McClure saw Eddy as a \\"natural\\" for the magazine, because of her marital history and idiosyncrasies: > The material was touchy, and would attract a world of readers both of the > faithful and the doubters. ... The job seemed to [Cather] a little infra > dig, not on the level where she cared to move. But she inspired confidence, > had the mind of a judge and the nose of a detective when she needed > it.Sergeant 1953, 55. =Willa Cather's authorship=Manuscript The Christian Science church purchased the book's manuscript and holds it in the church's Mary Baker Eddy Library in Boston. According to David Stouck, professor emeritus of English at Simon Fraser University and author of several books on Willa Cather, Cather's handwriting is evident on the manuscript in edits for the typesetter and notes with queries. Several of Cather's later characters appear to have been modeled on her portrait of Eddy, including Myra Henshawe in My Mortal Enemy (1926).Stouck 1993a, xix. Willa Cather, c. 1912 Reluctant to discuss most of her work before O Pioneers! (1913), Cather told her father and close friends that she was the author of Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy but told others that her role had not been significant.Bohlke 1982, 288. According to L. Brent Bohlke of Bard College, editor of Willa Cather in Person (1990), Cather regarded the Eddy book as poorly written. While it contains some excellent writing and character analysis, Bohkle wrote, it is not well- structured; the editing failed to rid the book of the serialized nature of the McClure's pieces. Cather wanted to distance herself from journalism, according to Stouck, and sought to minimize her role in the articles because they had angered the Christian Science church.Stouck 1993a, xvii. Early letters Cather identified herself as the author on December 17, 1906, in a letter to her father, Charles F. Cather, in which she wrote that the articles beginning February 1907 (at the time written but not published) were hers. Apologizing for being unable to come home for Christmas, she explained that she had to get the March article ready: \\"But if you were here, my father, you'd tell me to stand by my job and not to desert Mr. McClure in this crisis. It would mean such a serious loss to him in money and influence not to have the March article come out—Everyone would think he was beaten and scared out, for the articles are under such a glare of publicity and such a fire of criticism. I had nothing to do with the _January_ article remember, my work begins to appear in February. Mr. McClure is ill from worry and anxiety ...\\".Jewell and Stout 2014, 99. She referred to her authorship again in a letter to the writer Harrison G. Dwight on January 12, 1907: > Mr. McClure tried three men on this disagreeable task, but none of them did > it very well, so a month ago it was thrust upon me. You may imagine me > wandering around the country grubbing among newspaper files and court > records for the next five months. It is the most laborious and sordid work I > have ever come upon, and it takes every hour of my time and as much vitality > as I can put into it. She continued: \\"You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap your poor brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder how I got here and why I am doing it. I never in my life wanted to do this sort of thing. I have a clean conscience on that score. Then why am I hammering away at it, I'd like to know? I often wonder whether I shall ever write another line of anything I care to.\\"Jewell and Stout 2014, 101. Letter to Edwin Anderson Edwin H. Anderson, director of the New York Public Library, 1909–1934 In 1982 Brent L. Bohlke discovered that Cather had written on November 24, 1922, to a friend, Edwin H. Anderson, director of the New York Public Library, confirming that she was the author of the entire book except for the first chapter.Stout 2002, 98, letter number 649.Bohlke 1982, 291–292.Stouck 1993a, xvi; Stouck 1993b, 500–501; Jewell and Stout 2014, 330–331. Georgine Miline had brought the research to McClure's, she wrote, \\"a splendid collection of material\\", but Milmine lacked the technical skills to write it up: > Mr. McClure tried out three or four people at writing the story. It was a > sort of competition. He liked my version the best chiefly because it was > unprejudiced—I haven't the slightest bone to pick with Christian Science. > This was when I first came to New York, and that piece of writing was the > first important piece of work I did for magazines. After I finished it, I > became Managing Editor.\\"Cather, November 24, 1922. Burton J. Hendrick (who went to work for the book's publisher, Doubleday, founded in 1897 as Doubleday & McClure Company) had written the first installment, Cather told Anderson, but it had been based largely on rumor: \\"with what envious people and jealous relatives remember of Mrs. Eddy's early youth\\". She said Hendrick was \\"very much annoyed at being called off the job and never forgave Mr. McClure\\". As for the other 13 installments: \\"A great deal of time and money were spent on authenticating all the material, and with the exception of the first chapter, I think the whole history is as authentic and accurate as human performances ever are.\\" She added: \\"Miss Milmine, now Mrs. Wells, is in the awkward position of having her name attached to a book, of which she didn't write a word.\\" Cather believed Frank Nelson Doubleday, Doubleday's co-founder, should have promoted the book more: \\"Undoubtedly, Doubleday has perfectly good business reasons for keeping the book out of print. There has been a great demand for it to which he has been consistently blank. You see nobody took any interest in its fate. I wrote it myself as a sort of discipline, an exercise. I wouldn't fight for it; it's not the least in my line.\\" She asked Anderson to keep what she had told him confidential: \\"I have never made a statement about it before, in writing or otherwise. I suppose somebody ought to know the actual truth of the matter and so long as I am writing to you about it, I might as well ask you to be the repository of these facts. I know, of course, that you want them for some perfectly good use, and will keep my name out of it.\\" Cather left a clause in her will forbidding the publication of her letters and private papers, which meant that for many years her letters could only be paraphrased by scholars.Perrotta 2013. The correspondence entered the public domain in the United States on 1 January 2018, 70 years after her death in April 1947.Stout 2002, xi, 98, letter 649. Nevertheless, the Willa Cather Trust permitted the publication of selected letters in 2013, including the letter to Anderson.Jewell and Stout 2014, 330–331. Early public indications In letters to others, Cather continued to deny her authorship; she told Genevive Richmond in 1933 and Harold Goddard Rugg in 1934 that she had helped only to organize and rewrite parts of the material. An early public suggestion of her authorship was made by the columnist Alexander Woollcott in the New Yorker in February 1933: \\"And speaking of ghostwriters and Mrs. Eddy, I have recently learned on almost (if not quite) the best authority in the world that the famous pathfinding predecessor of all these [Eddy] biographies—the devastating series published in McClure's under the name of Georgine Milmine in the brave days of 1906—were not actually written by Miss Milmine at all. Instead, a re-write job based on the manuscript of her researches was assigned to a minor member of the McClure staff who has since made quite a name for herself in American letters. That name is Willa Cather.\\"Woolcott 1933. In March 1935, the Los Angeles Times reported that a copy of the book listed for sale by Philip Duschnes, a New York bookseller, was found to contain an editor's note that the book had been written by Cather. Witter Bynner, an associate editor for McClure's when the series and book were published, had signed the book on February 12, 1934, and added: \\"The material was brought to McClure's by Miss Milmine, but was put into the painstaking hands of Willa Cather for proper presentation, so that a great part of it is her work.\\"Bohlke 1982, 290. Responses=Mary Baker Eddy's response= In a statement published by the Christian Science Sentinel on January 19, 1907, Eddy responded to the early installments in McClure's by challenging its description of her father, early family life, and the issues surrounding her marriages. McClure's had said that the Bible was the only book in the house when she was growing up; on the contrary, she wrote, her father was a great reader. To counter McClure's claim that her childhood home had provided a \\"lonely and unstimulating existence\\", her statement described the educational and professional achievements of her family. In response to McClure's description of her as bad tempered, she offered as an example of her kindness that a housekeeper of the family's had resigned because Eddy allowed a blind girl, who had knocked on the door and was unknown to the family, to stay with them. =Church response= Witter Bynner, then a McClure's associate editor According to Peter Lyon in his biography of S. S. McClure, when the series began, three Christian Science officials arrived at the McClure's offices and asked an editor, Witter Bynner, to take them to McClure: > The Christian Scientists came in. Before they sat down, they stood on chairs > and closed the transoms over the two doors to the rooms. Then they made > their demand: the series must not be published. S.S. scowled at them and > said nothing. To fill the silence, Brynner began rather nervously to assure > the Scientists that the articles were not sensational, not offensive; that > there was no cause for apprehension; that all the facts had been most > carefully verified. ...One of the Scientists cut in to suggest that perhaps > there would be no objection to publication of the material if the Scientists > were permitted to edit it as they might please.Lyon 1963, cited in Fraser > 1999, 138–139. When McClure refused, they said he would soon notice a loss of advertising. The church purchased the manuscript when the book appeared, and there were rumors that the plates had been destroyed. In June 1920 it also purchased some of McClure's research files from a New York manuscript dealer, including notes from Milmine and drafts of the book handwritten by Cather.\\"Georgine Milmine Collection\\". Christian Scientists were reported to have bought and destroyed copies of the book, and removed them from libraries.Fraser 1999, 139. Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant wrote in 1953 that the book \\"disappeared almost immediately from circulation—the Christian Scientists are said to have bought the copies\\". It became scarce even in libraries. According to Sergeant, readers in the 1950s were likely to have to borrow it from the chief librarian and be watched while reading it.Sergeant 1953, 56. =Baker Book House edition= The book's copyright expired 28 years after publication. Baker Book House, a Christian publishing house, republished it in 1971 \\"in the interest of fairness and objectivity\\", according to its back cover. The introduction by Stewart Hudson explored Cather's involvement in the authorship and the influence of Eddy on several of Cather's characters, particularly Enid Royce and her mother in One of Ours.Isaacson 1971.Stouck 1993b, 499. =University of Nebraska Press edition= Caroline Fraser writes that the church tried to stop the University of Nebraska Press from republishing the book in 1993. The press was interested in doing so, under its Bison Books imprint with a new introduction by David Stouck, because the articles and book were Cather's first extended work and therefore important in her development as a writer.Fraser 1999, 140. They obtained a copy of the original 1909 edition, by then hard to come by, from the Leon S. McGoogan Library of Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.Stouck 1993a, front matter. According to Fraser, the head of the church's public-relations office, the Committee on Publication, called the press and told them the reprint might damage the church's and Eddy's reputation. According to a press representative who spoke to Fraser, the church representative \\"felt it was his responsibility to try to bully us into stopping publication or into saying that the book was worthless\\". Stouck made clear his view in the book's preface that Willa Cather was \\"indisputably the principal author\\". But, according to Fraser, there were fears for the jobs of the church researchers who had helped make the Cather–Milmine manuscript available for examination. Stouck therefore agreed to add a statement to the book, which, in Fraser's view, was essentially a church press release: > Since the Bison re-issue of The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History > of Christian Science went to press new materials have come to light which > suggest that Ms. Eddy's enemies may have played a significant role in > organizing the materials for the \\"Milmine\\" biography. New information about > Georgine Milmine, moreover, suggests that she would have welcomed biased > opinion for its sensational and commercial value. The exact nature of Willa > Cather's part in the compiling and writing of the biography remains, > accordingly, a matter for further scholarly investigation. The \\"enemies\\" Stouck refers to relate to the \\"Next Friends\\" lawsuit that was initiated in March 1907, after the McClure's serialization had begun. It was filed by Eddy's relatives, including her son, who maintained that she was unable to manage her own affairs; had it succeeded, she would have lost control of the church and her fortune. The suit was funded by Joseph Pulitzer, owner of the New York World; his motive, Fraser wrote, was to engineer a story about Eddy to rival that of McClure's.Fraser 1999, 137. The McClure's journalists were allegedly in touch with the litigants.Gill 2000. According to Fraser, the head of the church's Committee on Publication included the following in a report for its 1993 annual meeting: > A major corrective opportunity this year involved the rerelease of one of > the earliest malicious biographies of Mrs. Eddy, The Life of Mary Baker G. > Eddy and the History of Christian Science by Georgine Milmine. Dating from > the yellow journalism period, this book was published in an attempt to > discredit her. The current publisher, after much correspondence with our > office, instead issued a statement accurately characterizing its bias. The > book has received almost no attention in the public, proving if Truth isn't > spoken, nothing is said.Fraser 1999, 140–141. =Reception and influence= Journalist Will Irwin, McClure's managing editor at the time The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy became a key primary source for biographies of Eddy that were published independently of the church. It influenced Lyman Pierson Powell's Christian Science: The Faith and its Founder (1907); Edwin Franden Dakin's Mrs. Eddy: The Biography of a Virginal Mind (1929); Ernest Sutherland Bates and John V. Dittemore's Mary Baker Eddy: The Truth and the Tradition (1932);Gill 1998, 567. and Martin Gardner's The Healing Revelations of Mary Baker Eddy (1993).Gardner 1993, 41. Robert Peel, a life-long Christian Scientist and member of the church's Committee on Publication, also used it extensively as a source in his own three-part biography of Eddy (1966–1977). A New York Times reviewer wrote in February 1910 that the book \\"ranks among the really great biographies—or would were its subject of more intrinsic importance\\": > Since this Life first appeared in McClure's Magazine not one important > statement as of fact in it has been disproved or even seriously questioned. > It is a product of much and highly intelligent labor, and were Christian > Scientists open to argument or amenable to reason the wretched cult would > not have survived its publication for a single month. It is unanswerable and > conclusive, and nobody who has not read it can be considered well-informed > as to the history or nature of Eddyism.The New York Times, February 26, > 1910. Also in February 1910, a reviewer in The Nation compared the book to Ida Tarbell's The History of the Standard Oil Company (1904), which similarly began as a series in McClure's and hastened the demise of the company: \\"Miss Milmine, like Miss Tarbell, is plainly not in sympathy with the persons or the movement she describes. But the indictment, if we choose to call it that, is framed dispassionately. The damaging evidence is elaborately built up and skilfully arranged, but the reader is left largely to form his own conclusions.\\" Arguing that the result is \\"an historical record of high value and of fascinating interest\\", the reviewer concluded that the book \\"demolishes Mrs. Eddy without necessarily demolishing Christian Science\\".The Nation, 1910. Reviewing the book in the American Historical Review in July 1910, I. Woodbridge Riley, author of The Faith, the Falsity and the Failure of Christian Science (1925), wrote that the book's value lay in part that it was an analysis of a woman by a woman, and that it unearthed early primary sources, such as court testimony and Eddy's ads for herself as a mental healer. It did not make enough of Eddy's hypochondria and delusions of persecution, but it nevertheless \\"offers a strangely interesting human document. Mrs. Eddy is more than a personality, she is a type. Given the free field of a democracy she illustrates the possibilities of a shrewd combination of religion, mental medicine, and money.\\"Riley 1910, 898–900. The journalist Adela Rogers St. Johns, a minister in the Church of Religious Science—a belief system closely related to Christian Science—wrote in 1974 that Cather was \\"a fine—maybe our finest—American woman novelist\\" but also a \\"lousy unscrupulous reporter\\", arguing that she had \\"stirred with grim fancy the most vicious and inaccurate of all the attacks on Mrs. Eddy\\".Bohlke and Hoover 2001, 58; for the Church of Religious Science, see McLellan 1988. David Stouck, in his introduction to the 1993 University of Nebraska Press edition, wrote that Cather's portrayal of Eddy \\"contains some of the finest portrait sketches and reflections on human nature that Willa Cather would ever write\\".Stouck 1993a, xviii. In a letter to The New York Review of Books in 2000, Gillian Gill disagreed that the book offers an accurate portrayal of Eddy; she argued, for example, that the story of Eddy having \\"fits\\" as a child to get her own way, or the way McClure's described them, was \\"invented more or less out of whole cloth\\" by McClure's journalist Burton Hendrick, and that the accounts of Eddy as \\"hysterical\\" were misogynist.

It is the twelfth book in his Roma Sub Rosa series of mystery stories set in the final decades of the Roman Republic. The main character is the Roman sleuth Gordianus the Finder. Plot summary The year is 46 BC. Having won the civil war, Julius Caesar is now the master of Rome. Gordianus the Finder and his family return home after their recuperative trip to Egypt, and are given grim news: Gordianus's friend, Hieronymus (whom Gordianus rescued from human sacrifice in Last Seen in Massilia) has been murdered. Caesar's wife, Calpurnia, who has become more superstitious and paranoid with each passing day, believes there is a plot to kill her husband. In Gordianus's absence, she hired Hieronymus to investigate, and now his murder seems to lend credence to the threat. Calpurnia is frantic, since her information indicates that the prospective assassin plans for Caesar to be dead by the end of his great triumph. As each day of the triumph goes by, Gordianus has no better plan than to follow in Hieronymus's footsteps, interviewing everyone he spoke with in the last days of his life. As he does so, Gordianus becomes conscious of just how many people have reason to want Caesar dead: *Mark Antony: once Caesar's right-hand man in the Gallic Wars, Antony has been demoted, and placed under virtual house arrest after some of his questionable actions as prefect of Rome in Caesar's absence; *Cicero: the last of Caesar's political enemies from the Roman Senate, Cicero has been humiliated by Caesar in both politics and war; *Cleopatra: Queen of Egypt and Caesar's lover, trying to legitimize their son Caesarion's status as Caesar's heir, and frustrated at his refusal to publicly acclaim the child as such; *Vercingetorix and Arsinoe IV: the former leader of the Gauls and Cleopatra's sister, respectively, both scheduled to be publicly executed during the triumph. While all of these people seem to have the motive for plotting against Caesar, few seem to have the inclination (for instance, Antony seems more interested in spending his days in debauchery, and Cicero is slavishly devoted to his new young wife, Publilia) and those that do (such as Vercingetorix and Arsinoe) seem to lack opportunity. During the triumph, Gordianus and his family happen to be in the crowd when a call by his simple- minded ward, Rupa, to spare Arsinoe's life, is taken up by the crowd, and moves Caesar to grant her pardon. No similar occurrence saves Vercingetorix, who is strangled in the Tullianum. The last day of the triumph arrives, and Gordianus is hopeful that nothing will happen, though he is still nagged by the mystery of Hieronymus's death. In the afternoon, he and his family happen to be attending a ceremony at a temple where Caesar is formally inaugurating his new calendar. For a moment, Gordianus hallucinates that he sees Hieronymus's ghost in front of him, telling him he has arrived at the root of the plot against Caesar. Suddenly, Gordianus realizes who the plotter is: Calpurnia's uncle Gnaeus Calpurnius, a descendant of King Numa Pompilius, and the high priest of the deified King's cult. King Numa gave the Roman people the calendar they are using now, and Gnaeus Calpurnius considers Caesar's replacement of it an unforgivable sacrilege. Just as he realizes this, Gordianus tackles Gnaeus Calpurnius shortly before he stabs Caesar in the back on the altar. Caesar remains oblivious to how close he came to death, and appears annoyed at Gordianus for disrupting the ceremony. In the aftermath of the Triumph, Gnaeus Calpurnius is discreetly abducted and executed. When Gordianus reports to Calpurnia, he notices that her anxiety and paranoia have not been assuaged by his success at uncovering the plot; if anything, she seems even more convinced that Caesar will be dead before long. Gordianus, having seen how many enemies Caesar has made in his career, privately redoubles his resolve to distance himself and his family from Caesar as much as possible.  Themes  The novel creates an ironic juxtaposition of Caesar's accomplishments. While interviewing the various suspects, Gordianus reflects how many people Caesar has killed during his campaigns as a general, how many bitter political enemies he has made, and how many people are opposed to him as a dictator. By contrast, Gnaeus Calpurnius's motive - resentment over the replacement of the ancient Roman calendar - seems to Gordianus a lunatic and nonsensical reason to commit murder. Yet, historically speaking, the Julian Calendar is arguably Caesar's widest and most-lasting accomplishment, far more significant than his military or political campaigns.

At the height of the crisis, several international financial institutions, European agencies and governments, and the largest European banks of the EBRD banded together with a list of goals and targets to accomplish. The initiative sought to prevent large scale withdrawals from developing regions and countries, ensure that large banks commit to maintaining exposure to subsidiaries and recapitalize them, avoid home bias in aid, agree on crisis management and resolution, and strengthen cross-border regulatory cooperation. At the height of the crisis, many were afraid of a 'Prisoner's Dilemma' occurring in which larger foreign banks would pull support and investment from developing subsidiaries and thus cause financial ruin. Although it would have been beneficial for one bank to do so if the other's had not, the Vienna Initiative succeeded in instilling cooperation to avoid this. Large European banks remained committed to their support and allowed for gradual deleveraging of the entire system and manage liquidity more efficiently. The Vienna Initiative was seen as a success by its leaders, since it mitigated the crisis and minimized financial distress in the target regions. The initiative was a significant mark in European banking cooperation and convergence. The success here will undoubtedly lead to further cooperation and aim towards a goal of a European macroeconomic policy to avoid any such credit risks in the future.

This was the inaugural year of both the University and the football team: the University opened in October 1891 and the four-game season was played in early 1892. Origins Soon after Stanford opened on October 1, 1891, students set out to form a football team. One transfer student, John Whittemore, had played football at Washington University. He was chosen as captain and began to organize the team. Whittemore acted as de facto coach, drawing up plays and organizing practices. The team won its first two games against Hopkins Academy and Berkeley Gym before losing to a team from San Francisco's Olympic Club. In its final game of the first season, Stanford upset a more experienced team from the University of California, Berkeley, setting the stage for what would become the longstanding Big Game rivalry.Results from ScheduleGame summaries=California= Soon after formation of Stanford's team, players at the University of California, Berkeley, which had been playing football for 10 years, contacted the team to set up a Thanksgiving Day game; as the Stanford team was still organizing, a spring game was eventually agreed to. On March 19, 1892, the Stanford and California teams met to play at Haight Street Grounds in San Francisco. Stanford's team manager was future U.S. President Herbert Hoover; Hoover had printed 10,000 tickets for the game, but soon an overflow crowd forced Hoover to collect cash payment for admission. As the game was about to begin, both teams realized that no one had brought a ball. An owner of a sporting goods store who was in attendance was dispatched on horseback to retrieve a ball and the game eventually started an hour late. Stanford employed some trick plays and scored the first three touchdowns of the game (touchdowns were worth 4 points at that time) and held on to upset the more experienced California team 14–10. Legacy The next season, Whittemore wrote to legendary Yale coach Walter Camp asking him to recommend a coach for Stanford; to Whittemore's surprise, Camp agreed to coach the team himself, on the condition that he coach the season at Yale first. Whittemore's son, also named John Whittemore and also a Stanford student, lived to the age of 104 and was renowned as a masters track and field athlete.

The South produced several electoral movements such as Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrats in 1948 and George Wallace's American Independent Party in 1968. The region has played an important role in Presidential elections, providing the winners in the elections of 1976, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004; and the loser in 1980 and 1992. Ante-bellum Due to the region's agricultural success, the South became integral to the electoral history of the United States. Many of the United States' early military and political leaders (including nine of its first twelve presidents) were elected from the Southern United States. After the Civil War After the Civil War many white Southerners who had actively supported the Confederacy were temporarily without some of the basic rights of citizenship (such as the ability to vote). With the passage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (which outlawed slavery), the 14th Amendment (which granted full U.S. citizenship to African Americans) and the 15th amendment (which extended the right to vote to black males), African Americans in the South began to enjoy a full range of citizens' rights which were broader than those extended to free blacks, even in the North, in decades before the war. White Democrats regained power by the late 1870s, and began to pass laws to restrict black voting in a period they came to refer to as Redemption. From 1890-1908 states of the former Confederacy passed statutes and amendments to their state constitutions that effectively disfranchised most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites in the South through devices such as residency requirements, poll taxes, and literacy tests. Twentieth- century political movements=Dixiecrat movement= In 1948, a group of Democratic congressmen, led by Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, split from the Democrats in reaction to an anti-segregation speech given by Minneapolis mayor Hubert Humphrey, founding the States Rights Democratic or Dixiecrat Party. During that year's Presidential election, the party ran Thurmond as its candidate and he had the Democratic party designation in the deep south states, which he carried. The movement then disappeared. = The Solid South = Solid South refers to the electoral support of white voters in the Southern United States for Democratic Party candidates for nearly a century after the Reconstruction era (1877–1964). In most of the South, very few blacks were able to vote. Democratic candidates typically won by large margins in the South in every presidential election from 1876 until 1948. The main exception was 1928 when candidate Al Smith, a wet Catholic, did poorly outside the Deep South. Especially in the 1960s, the national Democratic Party's support of the Civil Rights Movement, capped by President Lyndon Johnson's support for the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act, led to white southerners turning away from the Democratic Party. The Republican Party made gains in the South by way of its \\"Southern strategy.\\" Today, the Republican Party has substantial strength among white southerners. African Americans in the South have mostly voted with the Democratic Party in state and national elections since the civil rights years. Voting changes arrived in the mid-1960s when the federal government passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which restored the ability of minorities to vote. =George Wallace and the Southern strategy= In 1968, Democratic Alabama Governor George C. Wallace ran for President on the American Independent Party ticket. Wallace ran a \\"law and order\\" campaign similar to that of Republican candidate, Richard Nixon. While Nixon won, Wallace won a number of Southern states. This inspired Nixon and other Republican leaders to create the Southern Strategy of winning Presidential elections. This strategy focused on securing the electoral votes of the U.S. Southern states by having candidates promote states' rights and culturally conservative values, such as family issues, religion, and patriotism, which appealed strongly to Southern voters. Analysts evaluated issues of states' rights and busing as code words for the changes of integration. =Jimmy Carter, the 1976 Presidential election, and the rise of the Religious Right= In the 1976 election, former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter won the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. Carter, a peanut farmer and Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher became the first Democratic president to date to defeat the Republicans' Southern Strategy. He defeated George Wallace in the Democratic primary and carried every Southern state in the general election, with the exceptions of Virginia and Oklahoma. Carter ran a culturally Southern, populist campaign. People of his hometown of Plains, Georgia held fundraisers with \\"covered-dish\\" dinners and its residents traveled north to campaign by train on the \\"Peanut Express\\".http://www.plainsgeorgia.com/plains_to_the_white_house.html\\"Plains to the White House,\\" 1976. As a moderate Republican who generally kept his religious views to himself, Ford was unable to endear himself to Bible Belt voters. Carter's victory was significant in that he was among the few U.S. Presidents to have claimed to be a born-again Christian. By 1980 Carter's approval ratings plummeted due a poor economy and the Iran hostage crisis. In addition, although Carter had energized Southern evangelicals in his 1976 campaign, as perhaps the first \\"born-again\\" president, a backlash among some white conservative evangelicals led to the formation of the Religious right. It split the Southern evangelical vote and denied Carter a victory in many states. Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election in a landslide; Carter retained majorities in Georgia, West Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, becoming the last Democratic candidate to perform better in the South than nationally. =The Contract with America= In 1994, Pennsylvania-born Georgia Congressman Newt Gingrich ushered in a \\"Republican revolution\\" with his \\"Contract with America\\". Gingrich, then the Minority Whip of the House, created the document to detail what the Republican Party would do if they won that year's United States Congressional election. The contract detailed several proposed aspects of governmental reform. Nearly all of the Republican candidates in the election signed the contract. For the first time in 40 years, the Republicans won control of the Congress. Gingrich became Speaker of the House, serving in that position from 1995 to 1999. During this period, a number of current Congressional leaders were also from the South, including former President Pro Tem of the Senate Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas. Twenty-first century=2006 elections and return to Democratic control= In the early 21st century, Republicans were able to maintain their hold on the federal government, as President George W. Bush was able to forge a powerful coalition of Southern states that had been out of reach of the Republican party in the last two Presidential contests. In particular, Bush's increased popularity following the September 11 attacks in 2001 enabled him to aid in the defeat of most Southern Democratic Senators in 2002 and 2004. On November 7, 2006, however, the Democratic Party once again regained control of the House and Senate, as well as control of the Southern Governors Association. The election was the first since the Gulf Coast was struck by Hurricane Katrina. Prior to the election, two government scandals involving Congressional Republicans fueled a public backlash. The first was the Abramoff scandal, in which lobbyist Jack Abramoff and others presented bribes to legislators on behalf of Indian casino gambling interests. In the South, the scandal had the effect of ending Ralph Reed's political career, when he lost the primary election for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia. The scandal also ended the career of House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas. In 2005, a Texas grand jury indicted DeLay on criminal charges that he had conspired to violate campaign finance laws. DeLay denied the charges, saying that they were politically motivated, but Republican Conference rules forced him to resign temporarily from his position as Majority Leader. In January 2006, under pressure from fellow Republicans, DeLay announced that he would not seek to return to the position. In the months before and after this decision, two of his former aides were convicted in the Jack Abramoff scandal. DeLay ran for re-election in 2006, and won the Republican primary election in March 2006, but, citing the possibility of losing the general election, he announced in April 2006 that he would withdraw from the race and resign his seat in Congress. He resigned on June 9, 2006, and sought to remove his name from the ballot. The court battle that followed forced him to remain on the ballot, despite having withdrawn from the race. Democrat Nick Lampson ultimately won DeLay's House seat in TX-22. A second scandal, commonly known as the Mark Foley scandal, involved Florida Congressman Mark Foley's sending sexually explicit messages to underage Congressional pages. Foley resigned, but his name remained on the ballot, and Democrat Tim Mahoney won the general election. The scandal led to Foley's resignation from Congress on September 29, 2006. It is believed to have contributed to the Republican Party's loss of control over Congress in the November 7, 2006 election, as well as the end of House Speaker Dennis Hastert's leadership of the House Republicans. Kirk Fordham also resigned as a result of the scandal. (See Mark Foley scandal.) Senate In 2006, the close contest that determined the final outcome of Democratic Senate control was Democrat and former Marine Jim Webb's unlikely victory against incumbent Virginia Senator (and former Governor) George Allen. Allen's poll numbers had plummeted after a video was released of Allen taunting an Indian-American student at a rally with what were interpreted as racially charged remarks. (See Macaca (slur).) In Missouri, Democrat Claire McCaskill defeated incumbent Senator Jim Talent. House of Representatives * In Texas, both the twenty-second and twenty-third districts switched to Democratic control. * In Florida, both the sixteenth and twenty-second districts were lost to Democrats. * In North Carolina's eleventh House district, Heath Shuler defeated incumbent Charles H. Taylor. Changing Congressional leadership While Republicans lost key Congressional leadership positions following the 2006 elections, new Democratic leaders emerged from below the Mason–Dixon line. =United States House of Representatives= * Jim Clyburn of South Carolina became the third-ranking House Majority Whip, the first South Carolina native to hold the position, while South Carolinian John Spratt became chairman of the House Budget Committee. * Bennie Thompson of Mississippi became chairman of the United States House Committee on Homeland Security. * Nick Rahall of West Virginia chaired the United States House Committee on Natural Resources. * Bart Gordon of Tennessee led the United States House Committee on Science and Technology. * The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence was chaired by Silvestre Reyes of Texas. =United States Senate= * Following his re-election in 2006, Robert Byrd of West Virginia became chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and President pro tempore of the United States Senate, placing him third in line in Presidential succession. * Jay Rockefeller, also of West Virginia, chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee. Democratic control of Governorships In the 2006 gubernatorial elections, Mike Beebe of Arkansas regained the governorship previously held by Republican Mike Huckabee. In Maryland, Martin O'Malley defeated incumbent Republican governor Bob Ehrlich. In 2007, Kentucky Democrat Steve Beshear defeated incumbent Republican governor Ernie Fletcher. These victories gave the Democratic Party a decisive 10-8 majority in the Southern Governors Association. Joe Manchin of West Virginia subsequently became chairman of the association, while Tim Kaine of Virginia became Vice-Chairman. =Republican resurgence=Virginia, 2009 Only a year after Barack Obama won a comfortable victory in the 2008 presidential election, the first signs of a GOP resurgence in two gubernatorial elections were seen, one of them in the South. In Virginia, a state that Obama carried by 6%, Republican Bob McDonnell won the seat vacated by the term-limited Kaine by a 17% margin. This proved to be a prelude to more significant pickups in 2010. 2010 The 2010 elections were held in the backdrop of economic uncertainty, a controversial health-care reform law passed shortly before the elections, and a reenergized conservative movement, with its most visible manifestation being the Tea Party movement. =Gubernatorial elections= Eight Southern states held gubernatorial elections. The GOP picked up two seats held by term-limited Democrats; Mary Fallin won the seat vacated by Brad Henry in Oklahoma and Bill Haslam won the seat vacated by Phil Bredesen in Tennessee. The GOP also held all of its other Southern governorships. Rick Perry won a third term in Texas, while Robert Bentley, Nathan Deal, and Nikki Haley won seats held by term- limited Republicans in Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. In Florida, Rick Scott won the seat vacated by Charlie Crist, who was elected as a Republican but switched to an independent during his unsuccessful U.S. Senate run. These results gave the GOP an 11–7 majority in the Southern Governors Association when all the new governors were sworn in. =U.S. Senate= The GOP made substantial gains in the U.S. Senate. While the Democrats maintained control over the chamber, their majority was reduced from 59–41 to 53–47 (both totals include two independents who caucus with the Democrats). One of the GOP pickups came in Arkansas, where John Boozman easily defeated incumbent Blanche Lincoln. The Republicans also successfully defended all of their own seats, including eight in the South. = U.S. House= The greatest Republican gains came in the U.S. House, where the GOP more than erased its losses from 2006 and 2008 by gaining 63 seats, retaking control of the chamber in the process. These gains were the largest by either party in any House election since 1948 and in a midterm election since 1938. U.S. Congress When the 112th Congress convened in January 2011, many leadership positions in the new GOP majority were held by Southerners: * Eric Cantor of Virginia is House Majority Leader. * Jeb Hensarling of Texas is Conference Chairman. * Frank Lucas of Oklahoma is the chair of the Agriculture Committee. * Joe Barton of Texas is the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee. * Jo Bonner of Alabama is the chair of the Ethics Committee. * Spencer Bachus of Alabama is the chair of the Financial Services Committee. * Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida is the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. * Lamar Smith of Texas is the chair of the Judiciary Committee. * Ralph Hall of Texas is the chair of the Science and Technology Committee. * John Mica of Florida is the chair of the Transportation Committee.

But Pat disagreed with Ted's use of an electric cattle prod in training, and they divorced in the mid-1970s. She trained animals for the CBS television series Lassie, Gentle Ben and Daktari and the NBC series Flipper. She also worked on the Lincoln-Mercury ad campaign that featured Farrah Fawcett with two cougars in the 1970s. In 1976 Derby was working with Christopher, her cougar who appeared in Lincoln-Mercury commercials, at the Cleveland auto show when she met Ed Stewart. She and Stewart founded the Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) in 1984. Derby's 1976 book The Lady and Her Tiger was a harsh expose of the entertainment industry's treatment of animals, and PAWS became a leading advocate for better treatment of animals in captivity. PAWS first animal sanctuary encompassed 30 acres outside Galt, California, and was the first in the United States capable of caring for elephants.

Conscious Business: How to Build Value Through Values. Boulder: Sounds True. enterprises and people are those that choose to follow a business strategy, in which they seek to benefit both human beings and the environment. The conscious business movement in the US emerged from the theory of corporate social responsibility, which pushes for a \\"values-based\\" approach where values represent social and environmental concerns both locally and globally. This effort is related to not-just-for- profit business models, conscious consumerism, socially responsible investing, and Conscious capitalism. There is an alternative way of thinking about conscious business emerging in the UK, and perhaps other countries, which tries to avoid reification, regarding it less as a thing or a type of business which can be categorised, and more as an ongoing process including awareness, self-awareness, awareness of purpose, practice (social theory) and relationships.Pete Burden and Rob Warwick: Exploring Conscious Business Practice: Sensing as we act, reacting to what we sense AMED, 2 December 2013 In Italy, De Nardi Gianluca De Nardi, Gianluca (2017), The business model of 'conscious companies' The EcorNaturaSì case. in M. Fasan and S. Bianchi in The sustainable company. Trends, tools and case studies, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, pp. 129-158 (Italian version), English version 2019 illustrates through the use of business cases how every company could adopt conscious business processes. Conscious Capitalism Conscious business can be seen within the context of Conscious capitalism. See for example John Mackey's 2013 work on conscious capitalismJohn Mackey: Why Companies Should Embrace Conscious Capitalism. Forbes, 15 January 2013 and his book Conscious Capitalism: Liberating the Heroic Spirit of Business. Conscious business criteria=Doing no harm= It is generally agreed upon that the product or service of a conscious business should not be intrinsically harmful to humans or the environment. However, it is possible for such a business to be taking part in the conscious business movement if it is taking conscious steps to be more aware of its social and environmental effects, and to adopt more beneficial social or environmental practices. =Triple Bottom Line Model= Most conscious businesses subscribe to a Triple Bottom Line model of success. They aim to provide positive value in the domains of people, planet, and profit.  Profit  This is what distinguishes the entity as a business from the general social enterprise. The degree of understanding or \\"consciousness\\" of any conflict of interest between the profit motive and social goods varies widely from the standard sloganeering capital accumulating firm (\\"don't be evil\\") to those who seek nothing more than break-even to pay for their operations, are completely employee owned, etc..  People  A conscious business seeks to benefit both the external livelihood as well as the internal lives of its shareholders and employees. Furthermore, the business seeks to benefit all stakeholders including manufacturers, affected communities, and humanity at large. Some trends in conscious business which have arisen out of these efforts include: * The forming of wellness affirming workplace cultures * Improved employee benefit programs * Use of fair trade materials for manufacture or sale * Assistance to communities who supply raw materials * Assistance to communities who manufacture materials * Local community outreach programs  Planet  A conscious business will seek to minimize its impact on the environment, and replenish the environment where it is able. Conscious businesses may choose to benefit the environment in many different ways, some trends include: * Robust recycling programs * Building \\"green\\" or \\"zero-impact\\" workplace facilities * Using solar or wind energy in the workplace * Purchasing materials from organic or sustainable farmers * Purchasing renewable and sustainable materials * Working with environmentally conscious distributors * Urging manufacturers and distributors to adopt better environmental practices * Adopting sustainable product packaging =Above and beyond= Many conscious businesses choose to use their resources to benefit social and environmental programs that are not directly related to the creation or distribution of the product or service. Frequently, a conscious business will donate employee paid time, money, or products towards various non-profit organizations. Sometimes a conscious business will create a foundation, which works with one particular cause. Also, some conscious businesses will become involved with social or political campaigns to protect the environment, animals, or people. Conscious businesses will sometimes use significant amounts of their profit towards these causes. Furthermore, a conscious business will sometimes work closely with suppliers in either a farming or manufacturing community in a developing country, and help to develop the community economically and replenish it environmentally. = The Conscious Business Declaration = In 2015 Humanity’s Team, an NGO, engaged with the Goi Peace Foundation of Japan, the Club of Budapest, and the Fowler Center for Business as an Agent of World Benefit at Case Western Reserve University to draft the Conscious Business Declaration. Self-described as \\"A New Standard for Business in the 21st Century,\\" it took over a year to write the declaration, and it was officially made public in early 2016. People can show their support for the declaration by \\"signing\\" it online.  The Conscious Business Declaration consists of a preamble and seven principles = Preamble = As a global community of business leaders we are committed to developing the awareness and skills needed to consciously evolve our organizations in alignment with these principles: = The Principles = # We Are One with humanity and all of life. Business and all institutions of the human community are integral parts of a single realityinterrelated, interconnected and interdependent. # In line with this reality, the purpose of Business is to increase economic prosperity while contributing to a healthy environment and improving human wellbeing. # Business must go beyond sustainability and the philosophy of “do no harm” to restoring the self-renewing integrity of the Earth. # Business must operate with economic, social, and ecological transparency. # Business must behave as a positive and proactive member of the local and global communities in which it operates. # Business that sees, honors, and celebrates the essential interconnected nature of all human beings and all life maximizes human potential and helps create a world that works for all. # When aligned with Oneness, Business is the most powerful engine on Earth for creating prosperity and flourishing for all. Conscious business versus social responsibility To term a business a conscious business is different from the concept of a socially responsible business: although, of course, a conscious business is likely to be socially responsible. Being a conscious business does not only mean implementing a local community program, or creating a company foundation. A business could implement one of these programs and still not be aware or respond to the fact that the business as a whole is doing more harm than good. The term conscious business implies that a business will seek to be conscious of its impact on the world in various spheres, and continue this inquiry over time. It is concerned with both its impact on a human’s inner and outer world as well as animal and environmental well-being. Furthermore, a conscious business considers both short-term and long-term effects of its actions or inactions. A conscious business evolves as does the methods that a business can and chooses to be of benefit to the world and to function with awareness. Therefore, though conscious businesses will be socially responsible, the term \\"conscious business\\" holds larger connotations for the businesses' actions than does social responsibility. Conscious businesses movement Many believe that Anita Roddick pioneered the conscious business movement with her company, The Body Shop in 1976. This company has been an environmental leader, and worked to support various activist causes including putting an end to animal testing, and defending human rights. An overwhelming amount of conscious businesses can be found in the health food industry as well as the LOHAS (lifestyles of health and sustainability) market. However, today conscious businesses can be found emerging in almost all aspects of the business world. Whole Foods cofounder, John Mackey, is another pioneer in the movement along with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. Large corporations as well as small boutique agencies and individuals embrace the movement despite pressure to earn money at any cost. They see business based on ethics and social responsibility versus personal gain. Public relations and brand specialist Sarni Jaye based her business on working only with conscious brands to help them grow and achieve their desired mission. USA Today reported about the wave of millennials embracing conscious business. Other businesses cited are Trader Joe's, The Container Store, Nordstrom, and more.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/21/starbucks-face- conscious- capitalismhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/03/25/kindness- panera-bread-nordstrom-starbucks/1965183/ There are various agencies and companies that catalogue the social and environmental practices of businesses for consumer use, as well as companies which consult with businesses to increase their awareness and beneficial practices in the world. Conscious business is about people who are aware of the impact each of their habits and actions has on their environment (people and planet). It is about people who live their lives based on knowing that everything is interconnected. It is about people, who know who they are: *who know about their strengths and weaknesses and *who desire to live and work with joy, creativity and ease instead of fear, power and domination. Conscious business versus sustainability There's a huge trend towards more sustainable business practices. Environmental sustainability, however, has little to do with conscious business. Organizations can be highly sustainable, but still run in an unconscious way. A conscious business, however, will not maintain unsustainable business practices. Reification SomePete Burden and Rob Warwick: The Purpose and Practice of Conscious Business AMED, Spring 2014 are expressing caution about the way that conscious business might be reduced to a formulaic framework and schema. The concern is that these play down the attention that we give to everyday practices and how people relate to each other. The alternative view is that the practice of conscious business aims to raise awareness of the hurly-burly of everyday life and help people notice those assumptions that influence our perceptions and practice – to become more aware. From that emerges consciousness of purpose; it also leads to adoption of many of the approaches outlined by Kofman, Mackey and others, and to the outcomes they point to (better long term business performance, for example). This approach is aligned with a view of business derived from Complexity theory and organizations. Impact on Professionals The idea of conscious business as a reflexive approach – through noticing and awareness as we act – suggests that there are practical implications for OD (Organization Development) and HR (Human Resources) professionals. For example, such professionals may find it useful to highlight the importance of noticing group dynamics, power, and other group phenomena. And ultimately to question their own assumptions about the purpose of business. In this way, this reflexive approach links back to the more ethical, but perhaps sometimes reified definitions, of conscious business.Pete Burden and Rob Warwick: Conscious business – impact and implications for HR and OD, Croner, January 2016 Further reading *Abergene, Patricia; Megatrends 2010: The Rise of Conscious Capitalism.

Early life and development Justin Summerton was born in Wirral Peninsula, in North West England. In 1972, when Justin was only 4 years old, his family emigrated to New Zealand, where he lives presently. Justin spent the next couple of decades in Dunedin. He also went to university in this same city, having completed both a Bachelor of Commerce (1987) and a Bachelor of Arts (1993) at the University of Otago. In 1990, Summerton got a studio flat at St Clair Esplanade, in Dunedin, where he did some of his early experiments with oils, working mainly with seascapes. The following year, he would have his first solo exhibition, at O'Brooks Gallery, in Dunedin. Traveling and street painting In 1992, Justin Summerton travelled to Liverpool. He rented a studio at the Bluecoat Chambers and worked on Liverpool cityscapes. He then went to paint and explore Paris, and then Copenhagen, in Denmark, where he was commissioned to paint a mural. Two years later, he went to the United States. There, he exhibited in Detroit and began \\"live painting\\" in Central Park, in New York City. He then continued with street painting in Nice, in the Côte d'Azur, South of France. In 1995, Justin could be found working out of a log cabin in Mendocino, Northern California. At that time, he exhibited his photomontage projects and oil on canvas at the International Art Café, in Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco. A year later, he was working at a studio in Redfern, in Sydney, Australia. While living there, he exhibited in a group show at the Darlinghurst Gallery, and he contributed with a photomontage study to the first Australian auction of contemporary photography at the Wemyss Gallery. In 1997, Summerton did paintings and photomontage studies of Tenerife (Canary Islands), Spain, Portugal, and London (live painting at Leicester Square). From 1997 to 1999, Justin was based in Dunedin, New Zealand, working on his technique and basing his work around the St Clair seascape.Exhibition catalogue for Surrealist in a Dreamlike World In 1999, being a keen surfer, he based himself in Karekare, to the West of Auckland, New Zealand, living initially at Bob Harvey’s bach. He is currently based in St Clair, Dunedin. Themes and technique Justin Summerton is a surrealist painter who depicts a dreamlike world in his work, often presenting New Zealand as a primeval landscape.Warwick Henderson Gallery website In his work, Summerton reveals a fascination with New Zealand natural elements, such as the sea, volcanic cones, mountains and cloud formations, which constitute the basis of all his work. His latest paintings have been described as inhabiting \\"a strange milieu halfway between representational landscape and surrealist dreamscape.\\"Daly-Peoples, J. (2002). \\"Representational Dreamscapes\\", in The National Business Review, 1 February 2002, p. 23. The artist makes the landscapes his own, by rearranging and/or adapting them to his vision, obeying to symbolic or allegorical purposes. The surrealist painter favours a utopian New Zealand: \\"Most of my art is related to the ecology of the world,\\" Summerton says. \\"I'm not a hippy, greenie painter who rants on, but maybe I am an environmentalist. New Zealand is a bit of an oasis like that and I've had that theme running through my work for a while.\\"Benson, N. (2008). \\"Bigger markets beckon artists\\", in Otago Daily Times, 29 May 2008 \\"Summerton’s works harness the raw energy of New Zealand landforms and coast lines through the texture of his paint. He captures and intensifies this power with layers upon layers of dense oils, culminating in a landscape that is far from traditional, and so referring to New Zealand landscape with a fresh perspective.\\"Exhibition catalogue for Surrealist in a Dreamlike World At a recent solo show of his paintings, his technique was described as \\"scrumbling\\", a \\"brushstroke technique to build layers of colour and texture onto the canvas surface. This approach tends to modify rather than obscure the previous layer and creates stark contrast between dark and light pigments. The overall result is a fresh and vibrant new view of the New Zealand landscape.\\"Warwick Henderson Gallery website According to Warwick Henderson Gallery administrator Pania Lincoln, \\"his intensive application of oils builds layers of colour and texture that give the works a visual and literal 3-dimentional [sic] quality that is unique.\\"S U M M E R T O N - Biography Justin feels a particular affinity with the New Zealand coastline and beaches, spending much of his time in the water as a passionate surfer. He explores the shores of many beaches throughout New Zealand in his paintings, from Piha (Auckland) to St Clair Beach (Dunedin). Summerton has been identified as one of the New Zealand contemporary artists whose work is being thrown into the investment fine art market within only a few years of being produced.Henderson, W. (2012). Behind the Canvas: An Insider’s Guide to the New Zealand Art Market.

Following Wolf Hall (2009) and Bring Up the Bodies (2012), it is the final installment in her trilogy charting the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell, minister in the court of King Henry VIII, covering the last four years of his life, from 1536 until his death by execution in 1540. Mantel's twelfth novel, her first in almost eight years, The Mirror & The Light was published in March 2020 to widespread critical acclaim, and enjoyed brisk sales. Plot The Mirror & The Light covers the period following the death of Anne Boleyn in 1536. It documents Cromwell’s ascent to the pinnacle of his riches and power, followed by his fall from royal favour and his public execution at Tower Hill in 1540. Publication Though Mantel had originally hoped to publish the book in 2018, it did not appear until March 2020. Mantel dismissed speculation the novel had been delayed due to writer’s block, distractions caused by stage and screen adaptations of her previous novels, or because she couldn’t bring herself to write Cromwell's execution scene. Saying the project had simply been difficult, Mantel added, \\"But that’s not an explanation that has any news value, so people are looking for a dramatic story of the whole process breaking down.” When it was published in the UK on 5 March 2020, bookstores opened at midnight to sell the title. Initial UK sales were brisk, with over 95,000 copies sold in the first three days. Henry Holt and Company published the US edition five days later, on 10 March 2020.  Reception  The Mirror and the Light received mostly laudatory reviews from critics. The New York Times called it \\"the triumphant capstone to Mantel’s trilogy,\\" the Financial Times called it \\"majestic and often breathtakingly poetic,\\" and the Washington Post called it a \\"masterful finale.\\" The Times Literary Supplement called it \\"some of the most complex and immersive fiction to have come along in years,\\" while the Guardian hailed it as a \\"masterpiece\\" and called Mantel's Cromwell trilogy \\"the greatest English novels of this century.\\" The Los Angeles Times called Mantel \\"unique among modern novelists in her ability to make the past as viscerally compelling as the present,\\" USA Today said that \\"every page is rich with insight,\\" and the Wall Street Journal called her Cromwell trilogy \\"a brilliant engagement with the exercise and metaphysics of power in 16th- century Europe.\\" However, the New Yorker criticised the lengthy novel (754 pages in its US edition), calling it \\"a bloated and only occasionally captivating work.\\" The Mirror and the Light was shortlisted for the 2020 Women's Prize for Fiction.

As part of its activities, the range has a permanent bomb disposal unit and its security is handled by the Polícia Aérea.Mais Alto 373, p. 10 The range is also home to a natural reserve which helps preserve flora and the existing wildlife, such as partridge, wild boar, little bustard, fox, common genet and rabbit. For preservation of its surroundings and natural life, the range has obtained an environmental management certificate (ISO 14001), in 2001, which has been regularly renewed over the years. Since 1998 the range also has a photovoltaic plant that powers its facilities.  History  The range was created by royal decree on March 24 1904, but dates back to 1896, when the Portuguese Army started acquiring the land necessary to establish a new artillery firing range. It was created mainly because the then existing range at Vendas Novas was not large enough to safely train with new artillery pieces being taken into service.Mais Alto 373, p. 6 Its first operational use was on September 18 1904, when it was employed in testing the recently acquired French Schneider-Canet Bocage howitzers. After reorganization of the Ministry of War, the area was later seen as unnecessary and its sale was considered, thus it was abandoned and had its equipment transferred to the School of Applied Artillery at Vendas Novas. In 1911, with a reorganization of the Army, the range was put under the command of the Army's Arsenal () for testing equipment and ammunition manufactured or adapted by the Army's workshops and units. Two new ranges were then established. In 1912 the field firing range began to be used to test both national and foreign ammunition manufactured by Fábrica Militar de Braço de Prata, a weapons factory that at the time was part of the Army's Arsenal. In 1933, Fábrica Militar de Braço de Prata took control and command of the field firing range and expanded its infrastructure.Mais Alto 373, p. 6 During World War II, as part of the Barron Plan (), the range was mainly used for storing anti-aircraft ammunition and artillery to aid in the aerial defense of the capital (Lisbon) and nearby military installations. This led to the range being transferred to the command of the Artillery Arm Directorate, integrated in the 1st Air Defense Group of Lisbon, and most of the complex's installations being abandoned after the end of the war.Mais Alto 373, p. 6 In 1954, the range was assigned to the State Aeronautics Sub-secretary, which oversaw the then newly formed Portuguese Air Force, and its firing ranges were only used for air-to-ground combat training. This use of the area led to the construction of new bombing ranges with targets for air-to-ground machine gun, bombing and rocket fire, as well three control and observation towers, warehouses, ammunition depots and an airstrip. At the end of 1955, a new reorganization of the Armed Forces assigned the range to the command of the National Defense General-Secretary while the administration was assigned to the Ministry of the Army. The unit was reassigned to provide support in the training of pilots and air crews in live fire and bombing, as well in the study and testing of ammunition, explosives and gunpowder. At this time the Fábrica de Braço de Prata had signed a contract to supply the United States Army with artillery ordnance. As such, new facilities were built at the Alcochete field to allow the testing of projectiles.Mais Alto 373, p. 7 With the beginning of the Ultramar War, Alcochete was equipped with five long-range radio antennas that allowed communications between the continent and the Portuguese military forces stationed in Angola, Guinea, Mozambique and Timor. In 1970, West Germany's Air Force was given temporary and transitional access to the field firing ranges at Alcochete as part of an agreement in which it maintained a training facility in Portugal, due to airspace limitations for military training in its country.Air Forces Monthly, p. 36. In 1980, as part of a new agreement between the two countries, activity on the range was divided between Portuguese and West German units, which gave more access and dedicated areas to German training units in exchange for West Germany financing further development of the infrastructure in the area. The range received new equipment and upgraded existing facilities for ballistics testing and started negotiations to expand its area in 1980. With the dismantling of the Portuguese ammunition and weapons manufacturing industry in the 1990s, all equipment and facilities connected to this sector were removed and the focus of the area changed to only serve as a firing and bombing range and for military maneuvers.Mais Alto 373, p. 8 On February 26 1993, the range was integrated into the Air Force, under the control of the Air Command (COFA). The designation was changed from Campo de Tiro de Alcochete (CTA) to Campo de Tiro on September 15 2010. In 2007, the 81st Fighter Squadron made use of the air-to-ground firing ranges while deployed to Monte Real Air Base.Mais Alto 366, p. 9  Current users  The field firing range is currently used by all branches of the Portuguese Armed Forces for military maneuvers involving units preparing for deployment, evaluation of new equipment, large scale military exercises and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) training. In addition to the Air Force units undergoing training and live ammunition exercises, the field firing range is also used by 552 Squadron for helicopter gun-mounted machine gun and cannon live fire training; 201 and 301 Squadron also use it for both air-to-air and air-to-ground training. This involves the firing of Mk-82, Mk-84, GBU-12 Paveway, GBU-49, GBU-31, GBU-33 and Mk-106 ordnance. In addition, the range has an all-terrain track certified by the National Firefighter School () which is used for training by the Air Force's rescue and firefighting units. The Portuguese Army makes further use of the complex for mortar and artillery training and MILAN anti-tank missile instruction courses. Airborne units make use of the area for parachute jumps due to the field's proximity to the Montijo Air Base, where the Air Force's C-295 and C-130 transport aircraft are based. The Portuguese Navy's Marine Corps use the field's firing range for small arms and heavy weapons fire training. The National Republican Guard's Companhia de Operações Especiais and subunits of the Infantry Regiment make use of the range for small arms fire, EOD and tactical training. The Grupo de Operações Especiais and Corpo de Intervenção, of the Polícia de Segurança Pública (PSP), use the range for anti-riot training. The PSP's Setúbal District Command also makes use of the area's firing range for civilian firearms carry license courses.

It is a high- density, youthful neighborhood with a high percentage of families headed by single parents. Falkum is largely a working-class neighbourhood, with a mix of low and high income residents, as well as many immigrants. Character Falkum has both a villa district and a residential section. The residential section is in the north, and consists chiefly of 63 apartment buildings. The villa district is in the South, and it is dominated by large houses and large villas. The mix of villa district and residential section can be seen as a part of the social democratic ideology that heavily influenced Norwegian society: People of different classes were to live peacefully on each side of the neighborhood. In recent times is the northern part of Falkum known for being a dense and diverse residential neighborhood of Skien. Suburban development began in the late 1950s, and today the area is characterized by a mix of Low-rises and high-rise apartment buildings. The residential section of Falkum was originally designed as a planned community for 5,000 residents, but now houses 10,000. It consists of 3 high-rise buildings. These massive residential towers were built in the 1970s. Today, Officially 10,000 people live in the neighbourhood's 3 apartment towers, 30 low rise buildings and 30 terraced house buildings, making it Telemark's most densely populated community. The southern part of Falkum, Søndre Falkum and Bakken, is characterized by villas and large houses in Empire- and Swiss-style from the 1840s-50s. This area was formerly known for a strong low-income class environment, especially in the 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Bakken was notorious for its heavy concentration of gangs and gang violence, such as the Bakkerampen, which all originated in the Bakken area. The district was fortunately not destroyed by any the great fires in 1777, 1854 and 1886. Bakken has with its low position often been hit by floods, the neighborhood was thus submerged by the flood in 1927. Today, the population is estimated to be about 5000 and has the highest income per capita in the western districts of Skien. It is one of the most expensive area in Skien due to the central location. The beach Bakkestranda is usually crowded during the summer. This is a well-known recreation area all year round, attracting people from the whole of Skien. The local soccer team, Skiens Grane, was founded in 1911 and has strong roots and traditions in this part of Skien. Sports Skagerak Arena viewed from Sparebank 1 tribune Skagerak Arena (capacity 13,500), the soccer stadium for the local soccer team Odds BK is located at Falkum. It is named Skagerak Arena after local sponsor Skagerak Energi and it was finished in 2008. Odd plays in the Tippeligaen and holds the record winning the Norwegian Football Cup the most times, the last coming in 2000. Parkland Next to Skagerak Arena is Stevneplassen, where car shows, flea markets, circuses, fairs, exhibitions, conferences, concerts and festivals are held. Stevneplassen is a 58,000 m² large park located in the district of Falkum (consisting of parkland, an indoor soccer pitch and an indoor skate board park). The most famous and traditional event at Stevneplassen is the Russefeiring, held in may each year.

He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians 2014. In 2016 he was awarded a European Research Council (ERC) grant, and in 2018 he received the Doctorate Honoris Causa from the Université Côte d'Azur. In 2019 he received the Doctorate Honoris Causa from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia too. Biography Figalli received his master's degree from the University of PisaSISTEMA ETD - Archivio digitale delle tesi discusse presso l'Università di Pisa in 2006 (as a student of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa), and earned his doctorate in 2007 under the supervision of Luigi Ambrosio at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa and Cédric Villani at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon. In 2007 he was appointed Chargé de recherche at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, in 2008 he went to the École polytechnique as Professeur Hadamard. In 2009 he moved to the University of Texas at Austin as associate professor. Then he became full professor in 2011, and R. L. Moore Chair holder in 2013. Since 2016, he is a chaired professor at ETH Zürich. Amongst his several recognitions, Figalli has won an EMS Prize in 2012, he has been awarded the Peccot-Vimont Prize 2011 and Cours Peccot 2012 of the Collège de France and has been appointed Nachdiplom Lecturer in 2014 at ETH Zürich. He has won the 2015 edition of the Stampacchia Medal, and the 2017 edition of the Feltrinelli Prize for mathematics. In 2018 he won the Fields Medal \\"for his contributions to the theory of optimal transport, and its application to partial differential equations, metric geometry, and probability\\".A Traveler Who Finds Stability in the Natural World, August 1, 2018 Work Figalli has worked in the theory of optimal transport, with particular emphasis on the regularity theory of optimal transport maps and its connections to Monge–Ampère equations. Amongst the results he obtained in this direction, there stand out an important higher integrability property of the second derivatives of solutions to the Monge–Ampère equation and a partial regularity result for Monge–Ampère type equations, both proved together with Guido de Philippis. He used optimal transport techniques to get improved versions of the anisotropic isoperimetric inequality, and obtained several other important results on the stability of functional and geometric inequalities. In particular, together with Francesco Maggi and Aldo Pratelli, he proved a sharp quantitative version of the anisotropic isoperimetric inequality. Then, in a joint work with Eric Carlen, he addressed the stability analysis of some Gagliardo–Nirenberg and logarithmic Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev inequalities to obtain a quantitative rate of convergence for the critical mass Keller–Segel equation. He also worked on Hamilton–Jacobi equations and their connections to weak Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theory. In a paper with Gonzalo Contreras and Ludovic Rifford, he proved generic hyperbolicity of Aubry sets on compact surfaces. In addition, he has given several contributions to the Di Perna–Lions' theory, applying it both to the understanding of semiclassical limits of the Schrödinger equation with very rough potentials, and to study the Lagrangian structure of weak solutions to the Vlasov–Poisson equation. More recently, in collaboration with Alice Guionnet, he introduced and developed new transportation techniques in the topic of random matrices to prove universality results in several-matrix models. Also, together with Joaquim Serra, he proved the De Giorgi's conjecture for boundary reaction terms in dimension ≤ 5, and he improved the classical results by Luis Caffarelli on the structure of singular points in the obstacle problem.

These compounds form deeply coloured plate-like crystals with a metallic sheen, hence their name. These bronzes derive their metallic character from partially occupied 4d bands. The oxidation states in K0.28MoO3 are K+1, O2−, and Mo+5.72. MoO3 is an insulator, with an unfilled 4d band. These compounds have been much studied since the 1980s due to their markedly anisotropic electrical properties, reflecting their layered structure. The electrical resistivity can vary considerably depending on the direction, in some cases by 200:1 or more. They are generally non-stoichiometric compounds. Some are metals and some are semiconductors. Preparation  The first report of a \\"molybdenum bronze\\" was by Alfred Stavenhagen and E. Engels in 1895. They reported that electrolysis of molten and gave indigo-blue needles with metallic sheen, which they analysed by weight as . The first unambiguous synthesis of alkali molybdenum bronzes was reported only in 1964, by Wold and others. They obtained two potassium bronzes, \\"red\\" and \\"blue\\" , by electrolysis of molten + at 550 °C and 560 °C, respectively. Sodium bronzes were also obtained by the same method. It was observed that at a slightly higher temperature (about 575 °C and above) only is obtained. Another preparation technique involves crystallization from the melt in a temperature gradient. This report also called attention to the marked anisotropic resistivity of the purple lithium bronze and its metal-to- insulator transition at about 24 K. Hydrogen bronzes were obtained in 1950 by Glemser and Lutz, by ambient-temperature reactions. The hydrogen in these compounds can be replaced by alkali metals by treatment with solutions of the corresponding halides. Reactions are conducted in an autoclave at about 160 °C. :Crystals of K0.28MoO3, also called \\"potassium-molybdenum blue bronze\\".  Classification  Molybdenum bronzes are classified in three major families: * Red bronzes with limiting composition , that is, : ** Lithium molybdenum red bronze Reau and others. ** Potassium molybdenum red bronze or ** Cesium molybdenum red bronze ** Potassium molybdenum red bronze a semi-conductor. * Blue bronzes, with limiting composition , that is, . Their electronic properties generally do not depend on the metal A. ** Potassium molybdenum blue bronze or ** Rubidium molybdenum blue bronze ** Thallium molybdenum blue bronze * Purple bronzes, generally with limiting formula . Their electronic depend strongly on the metal A. ** Lithium molybdenum purple bronze ** Sodium molybdenum purple bronze ** Potassium molybdenum purple bronze ** Rubidium molybdenum purple bronze ** Thallium molybdenum purple bronze The hydrogen molybdenum bronzes have similar appearances but different compositions: * Hydrogen molybdenum orthorhombic blue bronze , 0.23 < x < 0.4 * Hydrogen molybdenum monoclinic blue bronze , 0.85 < x < 1.4 * Hydrogen molybdenum red bronze , 1.55 < x < 1.72 * Hydrogen molybdenum green bronze or .

Based on the 1935 Austrian film Episode written and directed by Walter Reisch, the film is about a gifted young violinist who considers leaving a prestigious music academy to play in a jazz band to earn money. The academy's new president—a distinguished wealthy patron of the arts—convinces her to stay after secretly arranging a scholarship for her out of his own pocket, and the two begin attending concerts together. Complications arise when he asks his young business manager to take his place at one of the concerts. The film is notable for Heinz Eric Roemheld's musical direction and Ray Heindorf's unique swing orchestral arrangements of classical pieces. My Love Came Back was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on July 13, 1940. Plot A beautiful young violinist named Amelia Cornell (Olivia de Havilland) is a student at the prestigious Brissac Academy of Music in New York City. Unable to support her mother on her meager scholarship stipend, she is forced to provide music lessons in her spare time—something strictly forbidden by the school and enforced zealously by the dean of the school, Dr. Kobbe (Grant Mitchell). Frustrated by her financial constraints and at being treated like a child by the dean, Amelia decides to leave the academy and join a jazz group led by her fellow student and swing bandleader Dusty Rhodes (Eddie Albert). Meanwhile, after seeing Amelia perform at a concert, a distinguished wealthy patron of the arts, Julius Malette (Charles Winninger), finally accepts the academy's offer to make him president of the school—an offer inspired by Julius' wealth and influence. When he learns that Amelia is planning to leave the academy for financial reasons, Julius—who has a crush on the much younger violinist—secretly arranges for a second scholarship that will allow her to continue her studies. After Amelia meets her patron, the kind and gentlemanly president sends her a phonograph player and records, and escorts her to concerts to broaden her musical experience. One evening, Julius is unable to attend a concert with Amelia and sends his young business manager, Tony Baldwin (Jeffrey Lynn), to the concert hall to explain his absence. In the coming days, Tony and Amelia begin to fall in love, but Tony does not reveal his feelings, believing that Amelia is his boss's mistress. The budding relationship between Tony and Amelia is further complicated when Julius' brash son Paul (William T. Orr) discovers that Tony has been mailing company checks to Amelia, unaware that these \\"scholarship\\" checks were mailed at his father's request. When Paul accuses Tony of misappropriating company funds, Tony protects his boss with his silence. Later, Paul sees his Julius entering Amelia's apartment, he believes that his father is being unfaithful to his mother. He apologizes to Tony and thanks him for trying to shield his family from the sordid news. When Paul tells Tony that Julius is with Amelia, Tony decides not to see Amelia again, nor answer her calls. His distrust is reinforced when he learns that the checks sent to Amelia have been cashed—he doesn't know that her friend Dusty \\"borrowed\\" the money. Soon after, Julius and his wife organize a party and hire Amelia's roommate, Joy O'Keefe (Jane Wyman), and her boyfriend, Dusty Rhodes, to provide an evening of innovative classical and swing music. At the party, Amelia confesses everything to Mrs. Malette, and then plays swing violin with the band, shocking Julius and her teacher. The music critic at the party, however, is impressed, which gives her new style legitimacy. When Amelia learns that Dusty \\"borrowed\\" her check, and how that must have looked to Tony, she demands that Dusty explain to Tony what had been going on. Afterwards, Tony approaches Amelia in the garden, apologizes for his suspicions, and kisses her passionately.

It is about John Dee who investigates undercover on Her Majesty's Service. It was followed by The Heresy of Dr Dee.  Plot =Part 1= John Dee gets visited by Elizabeth I of England in Mortlake. She implies she wants to do some research on \\"our royal ancestor\\" King Arthur. Subsequently, her Secretary of State Sir William Cecil assigns him to seize King Arthur's bones. This would finally refute the still popular myth of King Arthur's messianic return. Sir William Cecil wants to have Arthur's bones \\"formally presented\\" to the Queen by Dee, who HRH considers \\"her Merlin\\". =Part 2= John Dee arrives in Glastonbury, where according to Giraldus Cambrensis some centuries ago a successful excavation of King Arthur's remains has taken place. When Dee's supporter Robert Dudley gets seriously sick, the local healer Eleanor Borrow is supposed to cure him. She goes fetching mineral water from the Chalice Well because she thinks it increases the impact of her herbal medicine. Later, when the mutilated corpse of Dudley's servant is found, Eleanor Borrow is suspected to have murdered him as a satanic ritual. =Part 3= John Dee learns that Queen Elizabeth is haunted by nightmares because it is unclear what happened to Arthur's bones. Still his search remains futile. He meets secretly with Eleanor Borrow. She informs him that her late mother worked with John Leland. Craving for visions he talks her into giving him some of her mother's most dangerous elixir. When he awakes after his trip, she has disappeared. =Part 4= John Dee continues his search and even excavates Eleanor Borrow's mother. In her coffin he finds a map she made together with the famous antiquarian John Leland. This reveals to him what Richard Whiting wouldn't disclose even under the most severe torture. But Eleanor has been arrested and sentenced to death. =Part 5= John detects the lost books of the destroyed Glastonbury Abbey. Hereby he also encounters Michel de Nostredame who discloses to him how the Jesuits attempt to replace the Protestantic Queen Elizabeth by Mary Stuart.  Characters  * John Dee is so famous counterfeit pamphlets are sold under his name, this making him an early victim of brand piracy *Francis Walsingham is the Queen's spymaster *Blanche Parry is Elizabeth I of England's lady-in-waiting and also John Dee's cousin *Sir William Cecil has already served Lady Jane Grey and Mary I of England *Edmund Bonner is an English bishop who warns that French Catholics take the current English Queen for a witch. *Peter Carew is an adventurer who leads John Dee to Glastonbury *Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester pretends to be a member of the Queen's Commission on Antiquities *Sir Edmund Fyche is a local authority who once hanged Eleanor's mother for alleged necromancy and accuses Eleanor too *Joan Tyrre is a woman who cherishes folklore and believes in it  Historical inaccuracies  Phil Rickman admits in the book's Notes and Credits that according to contemporary records Joan Tyrre lived in Taunton. Reception The novel received mixed reviews. Jennifer Monahan Winberry considered Rickman's tale enjoyable for connoisseurs of the Arthurian legend but also for aficionados of the Elizabethan era. Margaret Donsbach wrote the plot progressed \\"slow-moving at times\\" but a readership \\"interested in the Renaissance approach to science and the occult\\" would appreciate the novel as \\"an authentic, insightful portrayal of the period\\". Amanda Gillies praised Rickman for his diligent research and recommended his novel strongly for readers who relish historical crime stories. Kirkus Reviews published a similar opinion and judged Rickman had described historical persons \\"with admirable scholarship and verve\\". Publishers Weekly reviewer on the other hand complained Rickman's novel wouldn't \\"do justice to the intriguing Dee\\" and pointed out that Dee also was a mathematician.

The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Barry Johnson, guitarist Chase Knobbe, bassist and back-up vocalist Matt Ebert, and drummer Pat Ware. Background The idea for the name \\"Joyce Manor\\" was thought of by Barry. It came from the name of an apartment building by frontman Barry Johnson's house. Joyce Manor was originally a duo group consisting only of members Johnson and Knobbe, which they first thought of while drunk during a visit to Disneyland. Joyce Manor released a split 7\\" with Summer Vacation in the fall of 2010 via Muy Autentico Records. They joined 6131 Records in 2010. Their self-titled full-length debut was released in 2011 to a host of critical and fan praise. Punknews named it their \\"2011 Album of the Year\\" and it landed the band on many year-end best-of lists. Joyce Manor moved over to Asian Man Records (and Big Scary Monsters in the UK) for their next album, Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired, released in April 2012. This album contains a cover of The Buggles' \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\". Joyce Manor signed with Epitaph Records to release their third album Never Hungover Again, which was released on 22 July 2014. The album was produced by Joe Reinhart and it features Frances Quinlan from the band Hop Along on the cover. The band received attention within the indie and punk communities for its stance against stage diving after the band interrupted several sets to call out stage divers. In the fall of 2014, drummer Kurt Walcher was replaced by Jeff Enzor. In 2016 the band announced their fourth album, Cody, produced by Rob Schnapf. The ten track release features the single \\"Fake I.D.\\" and was released on October 7 through Epitaph. In 2018 the band announced their fifth album Million Dollars to Kill Me by releasing the title track as their first single. The album was released on 21st of September through Epitaph Records.

History Construction of the airfield began in 1941, with the aim of completion by 1942. It was constructed as standard A-shaped bomber airfield with 3 hard runways, the longest of the 3 being just over 1.5 km long. After completion, the airfield was put under Number 5 Group, RAF Bomber Command. In January 1942, the airfield became an RAF Flying Training Command station flying Airspeed Oxfords. May 1942 saw the Number 14 AFU move to Banff, Scotland. After this period, the airfield returned to the control of Bomber Command, Number 93 Group and became a satellite station of RAF Gamston. On 1 June 1943 No. 82 OTU formed using Vickers Wellingtons as was standard at the time, along with 5 Miles Martinets as target tugs for gunner training. On 9 August 1943, a crew from RAF Ossington was lost after the starboard engine of their Vickers Wellington Mk.X (MS471) during a cross-country training exercise. On 21 August 1943, Vickers Wellington Mk.X (HE332) collided with trees on its landing approach after another cross-country training exercise. Again, later in the year, the crew of Vickers Wellington Mk.III (BK387) encountered low fog and hit high ground at Tewitt Hall Wood. On 22 May 1944 a midair collision occurred between Vickers Wellington Mk.III (BJ819) and Supermarine Spitfire Mk.I (P7820). Both aircraft crash-landed safely at a field in Leverton, Lincolnshire. In June 1944, the OTU was joined at RAF Ossington by Number 1685 Training Flight with Curtiss Tomahawks where they stayed briefly. No. 82 OTU stayed until January 1945, when they were disbanded. Like many stations, RAF Ossington was transferred to RAF Transport Command where pilots were trained to fly Avro Lancasters and Avro Lancastrians on the London to New Zealand route. Eventually, the runways were broken up for the contstruction of the A1 (though some taxiways and buildings have survived). The following units were here at some point: * No. 6 Lancaster Finishing School RAF * No. 14 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit RAF * No. 14 Service Flying Training School RAF * No. 28 Operational Training Unit RAF * No. 82 OTU * No. 1384 (Heavy Transport) Conversion Unit RAF * No. 1685 (Bomber) Defence Training Flight RAF * No. 2840 Squadron RAF Regiment * Squadron & Flight Commanders School RAF * Transport Command Night Vision Instructors Training School RAF  Gallery  File:RAF Ossington Taxiway 8.jpg File:RAF Ossington AAA.jpg File:RAF Ossington Building.jpg File:RAF Ossington Taxiway.jpg File:RAF Ossington Taxiway 2.jpg File:RAF Ossington Building 2.jpg File:RAF Ossington Taxiway 5.jpg File:RAF Ossington Taxiway 6.jpg File:RAF Ossington Taxiway 9.jpg File:RAF Ossington Taxiway 4.jpg File:RAF Ossington Building 3.jpg File:RAF Ossington Taxiway 7.jpg File:RAF Ossington Hard Standing.jpg File:RAF Ossington Taxiway 3.jpg File:RAF Ossington Taxiway 10.jpg ReferencesExternal links * http://www.airfieldarchaeology.co.uk/raf-ossington.html Royal Air Force stations in Nottinghamshire 1942 establishments in England 1946 disestablishments in England ","title":"RAF Ossington"},{"id":"38610644","text":"Erythromycin 3-O-methyltransferase (, EryG) is an enzyme with systematic name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:erythromycin C 3-O-methyltransferase.

Barnes is a research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System fleet. The University of Washington School of Oceanography currently operates the vessel under a charter-party agreement. Other ships in use by the University of Washington include RV Thomas G. Thompson (T-AGOR-23) and Wealander. History Clifford A. Barnes began service as a United States Coast Guard icebreaking small harbor tug, . Built by Western Boat Building Co in 1965 for ice operations, search and rescue, and pollution response, she was one of fifteen of her class ordered by the Coast Guard. She was decommissioned in 1982 and turned over to the National Science Foundation, although ships of her class remain in service by the USCG. Current mission The University of Washington School of Oceanography uses the Barnes for oceanographic and fishery research in the protected littoral waters of Washington and British Columbia. The vessel serves as platform for research on the fjord system of Puget Sound and the surrounding bodies of water. She supports research best done in sheltered bodies of water, and on the effects of populated areas on coastal areas.http://www.unols.org/meetings/2012/201206fic/201206ficap05.pdf Barnes has a small science space, two winches, a crane, and can house up to six scientists and students. Cruises are generally only one day in length, although they sometimes run as long as six days. The university's use of Barnes is supported through a combination of grants and contracts, the university's operating funds, and self-sustaining revenue. Barnes has gone on over 77 cruises since April 2008. Community outreach An important non- research function of Clifford A. Barnes is to serve as a vehicle for community outreach. The main purpose of this outreach is to educate students about the marine sciences. This is primarily done through a two-day open house for local students grades 3–12. Faculty, crew, and students give tours of the ship, as well as demonstrations of marine research. Replacement Although an October 2011 National Science Foundation inspection revealed that Barnes is still in generally good condition, its limited scientific and berthing capacity have prompted the University of Washington to look for a replacement. Although the replacement ship would still operate primarily in and around Puget Sound, Jensen Maritime Consultants has been commissioned to draw up planshttp://www.unols.org/meetings/2010/201010fic/201010ficap14.pdf for a vessel that will feature faster cruising speed, extended range, and increased berthing, among other improvements.

Unlike conventional DNA amplification methods that are non-linear or exponential (in each cycle, DNA copied can serve as template for subsequent cycles), MALBAC utilizes special primers that allow amplicons to have complementary ends and therefore to loop, preventing DNA from being copied exponentially. This results in amplification of only the original genomic DNA and therefore reduces amplification bias. MALBAC is “used to create overlapped shotgun amplicons covering most of the genome”.Zong, C.; Lu, S.; Chapman, A.R.; Xie, S. (2012). \\"Genome-wide detection of single-nucleotide and copy-number variations of a single human cell.\\" Science 338, 1622. DOI: 10.1126/science.1229164. For next generation sequencing, MALBAC is followed by regular PCR which is used to further amplify amplicons.  Technological platform  Prior to MALBAC, a single cell is isolated by various methods including laser capture microdissection, microfluidic devices, flow cytometry, or micro pipetting, then lysed. MALBAC single-cell whole-genome amplification involves 5 cycles of quenching, extending, melting, and looping. = MALBAC primers = The major advantage of MALBAC is that DNA is amplified almost linearly. The utilization of specialized primers enables looping of amplicons which then prevents them from being further amplified in subsequent cycles of MALBAC. These primers are 35 nucleotides long, with 8 variable nucleotides that hybridize to the templates and 27 common nucleotides. The common nucleotide sequence is GTG AGT GAT GGT TGA GGT AGT GTG GAG. The 8 variable nucleotides anneal randomly to the single stranded genomic DNA molecule. After one extension, semi-amplicon, an amplicon containing the common nucleotide sequence on only the 5’ end, is made. This semi-amplicon is used as a template for another round of extension, which then results in a full-amplicon, an amplicon where the 3’ end is complementary to the sequence on the 5’ end. = Strand displacement = MALBAC primers have variable components which allow them to randomly bind to the template DNA. This means that on a single fragment at any cycle, there could be multiple primers annealed to the fragment. A DNA polymerase such as one derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst polymerase) is able to displace the 5’ end of another upstream strand growing in the same direction.\\"Aviel-Ronen, S.; Qi Zhu, C.; Coe, B.P.; Liu, N.; Watson, S.K.; Lam, W.L.; Tsao, M.S. (2006) \\"Large fragment Bst DNA polymerase for whole genome amplification of DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.\\" BMC Genomics 7. DOI:10.1186/1471-2164-7-312. = Error rate = Bst DNA polymerase has an error rate of 1/10000 bases.CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, Ausubel, F.M. et al. Vol. I., John Wiley & Songs, Inc. 1995. Pp 7.4.18.  Experimental workflow  Workflow overview of a MALBAC experiment. # Single-cell isolation and lysis – pg of genomic DNA fragments (10 to 100 kb) isolated from a single- cell are used as templates. # Melting – At 94 °C, double-stranded DNA molecules are melted into single stranded forms. # Quenching – After melting, the reaction is immediately quenched to 0 °C, and MALBAC primers are added to the reaction. # Extension – Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) extends the primers at 65 °C for 2 mins, creating semi-amplicons. # Melting – The reaction is heated to back to 94 °C to separate the semi-amplicon from the genomic DNA template. # Quenching - The reaction is quickly quenched at 0 °C, and followed by the addition of the same polymerase mix. The MALBAC primers efficiently bind to both semi-amplicons and genomic DNA template. # Extension - Bst DNA Polymerase (Large Fragment) extends the primers at 65 °C for 2 mins. At this step, full-amplicons are made for those that used semi-amplicons as templates, and also semi-amplicons are made for those that used the genomic DNA template as templates. # Melting – The reaction is heated to 94 °C to separate the amplicons from the template. # Looping – For full amplicons, the 3’ end sequence is now complementary to the 5’ end. At 58 °C, the two ends hybridize forming a looped DNA. This prevents the full amplicon from being used as a template in subsequent MALBAC cycles. # Repeat steps 6-9 five times – 5 cycles of linear MALBAC amplification. # Regular PCR – The MALBAC product is further amplified by PCR. By using the 27 common nucleotides as primers, only the full amplicons are amplified. At the end of PCR, picograms of genetic material is amplified to microgram of DNA, yielding enough DNA to be sequenced.  Applications  Detection of drug resistance genes using MALBAC MALBAC offers an unbiased approach to the amplification of DNA from a single cell. This method of single cell sequencing has a vast number of applications, many of which have yet to be exploited. MALBAC may aid in the analysis of forensic specimens, in pre-natal screening for genetic diseases, in understanding the development of reproductive cells, or in elucidating the complexity of a tumour.Baker, M. (2012). \\"Method offers blueprint of a single human cell.\\" Nature News. At its foundation, this technology allows researchers to observe the frequency with which mutations accumulate in single cells. Moreover, it permits the detection of chromosomal abnormalities and gene copy number variations (CNVs) within and between cells, and further facilitates the detection of uncommon mutations that result in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the field of cancer research, MALBAC has many applications. It may be used to examine intratumor heterogeneity, to identify genes which may confer an aggressive or metastatic phenotype, or to evaluate the potential for a tumour to develop drug resistance.Navin, N.; Kendall, J.; Troge, J.; Andrews, P.; Rodgers, L.; McIndoo, J.; Cook, K.; Stepansky, A.; Levy, D.; Esposito, D.; Muthuswamy, L.; Krasnitz, A.; McCombie, R.; Hicks, J.; Wigler, M. (2011). \\"Tumour evolution inferred by single-cell sequencing.\\" Nature Letter 472, 90-94. DOI: 10.1038/nature09807. A pioneering application of MALBAC was published in a December 2012 issue of Science and described the use of this technology to measure the mutation rate of the colon cancer cell line SW4802. By sequencing the amplified DNA of three kindred colon cancer cells in parallel with unrelated colon cancer cells from a different lineage, SNPs were identified with no false positives detected. It was also observed that purine- pyrimidine transversions occurred at a high frequency among the SNPs. The characterization of copy number and single nucleotide variations of single colon cancer cells highlighted the heterogeneity present within a tumour. MALBAC has been applied as a method to examine the genetic diversity amongst reproductive cells. By sequencing the genomes of 99 individual human sperm cells from an anonymous donor, MALBAC was used to examine genetic recombination events involving single gametes and ultimately provide insight into the dynamics of genetic recombination and its contribution to male infertility.Lu, S.; Zong, C.; Fan, W.; Yang, M.; Li, J.; Chapman, A.R.; Zhu, P.; Hu, X.; Xu, L.; Yan, L.; Bai, F.; Qiao, J.; Tang, F.; Li, R.; Xie, S. (2012). \\"Probing meiotic recombination and aneuploidy of single sperm cells by whole-genome sequencing.\\" Science 338, 1627. DOI: 10.1126/science.1229112. Additionally, within an individual sperm, MALBAC identified duplicated or missing chromosomes, as well as SNPs or CNVs which could negatively affect fertility.  Advantages  MALBAC has resulted in many significant advances over other single cell sequencing techniques, foremost that it can report 93% of the genome of a single human cell. Some advantages of this technology include reduced amplification bias and increased genome coverage, the requirement for very little template DNA, and low rates of false positive and false negative mutations. = Reduces amplification bias and increases genome coverage = MALBAC is a form of whole genome sequencing which reduces the bias associated with exponential PCR amplification by using a quasilinear phase of pre-amplification. MALBAC utilizes five cycles of pre-amplification and primers containing a 27 nucleotide common sequence and an 8 nucleotide variable sequence to produce fragments of amplified DNA (amplicons) which loop back on themselves to prevent additional copying and cross- hybridization.Reuell, P. (2013). \\"One cell is all you need – innovative technique can sequence entire genome from single cell.\\" Harvard Gazette. http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/01/one-cell-is-all-you-need/ These loops cannot be used as a template for amplification during MALBAC and therefore reduce the amplification bias commonly associated with the uneven exponential amplification of DNA fragments by polymerase chain reaction. MALBAC has been described to have better amplification uniformity than other methods of single sequencing, such as multiple displacement amplification (MDA). MDA does not utilize DNA looping and amplifies DNA in an exponential fashion, resulting in bias. Accordingly, the amplification bias associated with other single cell sequencing methods results in low coverage of the genome. The reduced bias associated with MALBAC has generated better genome sequence coverage than other single cell sequencing methods. = Requires very little template DNA = MALBAC can be used to amplify and subsequently sequence DNA when only one or a few cells are available, such as in the analysis of circulating tumour cells, pre-natal screens or forensic samples. Only a small amount of starting template (picograms of DNA) is required to initiate the process, and therefore it is an ideal method for the sequencing of a single human cell. = Low incidence of false positive and false negative mutations = Single cell sequencing often has a high rate of false negative mutations. A false negative mutation rate is defined as the probability of not detecting a real mutation, and this may occur due to amplification bias resulting from the loss, or drop-out, of an allele.Miller, C.R.; Joyce, P.; Waits, L.P. (2002). \\"Assessing allelic dropout and genotype reliability using maximum likelihood.\\" Genetics 160 (1) 357-366. The sequence coverage uniformity of MALBAC in comparison to other single cell sequencing techniques has enhanced the detection of SNPs and reduced allele dropout rate. Allelic dropout rate increases when an allele of a heterozygote fails to amplify resulting in identification of a ‘false homozygote.’ This may occur due to low concentration of DNA template, or the uneven amplification of template resulting in one allele of a heterozygote being copied more than the other. The allele dropout rate of MALBAC has been shown to be much lower (approximately 1%) compared to MDA which is approximately 65%. In contrast to MDA which has been shown to have a 41% SNP detection efficiency in comparison with bulk sequencing, MALBAC has been reported to have SNP detection deficiency of 76%. MALBAC has also been reported to have a low false positive rate. False positive mutations generated by MALBAC largely result from errors introduced by DNA polymerase during the first cycle of amplification that are further propagated during subsequent cycles. This false positive rate can be eliminated by sequencing 2-3 cells within a lineage derived from a single cell to verify the presence of a SNP, and by eliminating sequencing and amplification errors by sequencing unrelated cells from a separate lineage.  Limitations  * Due to the requirement for a low quantity of template DNA, contamination of target DNA by the operator or environment can potentially confound sequencing results. * In order to completely rule out false positives, it is necessary to compare the cell sequencing results to those obtained from 2-3 cells within the same lineage, as well as to cells from an unrelated lineage. * DNA polymerase used to amplify the template DNA is error prone and can introduce sequencing errors in the first cycle of MALBAC which are subsequently propagated. * Genome coverage at a single cell level using MALBAC is less uniform than bulk sequencing. Although MALBAC has improved the detection efficiency of single cell sequencing, it is unable to detect approximately one third of SNPs compared to bulk sequencing.

Jeremiah Everts Platt (1833-1899), a Connecticut native, was an early professor at Kansas State Agricultural College, employed at the college in 1864. Platt served as the first head of the preparatory department and professor of vocal music; he later taught mathematics and English. Although conferred with an honorary A.M. in 1872 by the college's board of regents, his outspoken support for prohibition led the regents to demand his resignation in 1889. Ordained as a minister in the Congregational Church in 1888, Platt left KSAC in 1889 and traveled throughout Kansas establishing Sunday schools. He and his wife subsequently continued this work in Oklahoma, where he is credited with establishing 150 Sunday schools. Platt purchased ten acres land in Manhattan in September 1867. The Manhattan Nationalist reported on October 13, 1871 that \\"Prof. Platt's new house is just enclosed and will be finished by the end of the term. It is of brick, two stories, with light limestone trimmings and is built in the best manner.\\" The house remained Platt's property while he lived in Oklahoma, 1893-1899, but was rented out. Platt died in 1899 and the house passed to his widow Jennie, who returned to Manhattan and resided at the house until 1904 when she sold it to Anna Neider for $3,000. Neider sold the property in 1917 and it was subsequently transferred by sale five times before being purchased by Roy T. and Alice Hulshizer in 1925. The Hulshizer's ran a tea room in the house for three years before selling it in 1928 to Andrew Ekdahl. The house remained in the Ekdahl family until 1965 when it was transferred to the Board of Riley County Commissioners. From 1965 through 1980, the house was used as dispatch headquarters for the county's ambulance service. In 1980, the Board of Riley County Commissioners transferred the property to the Riley County Genealogical Society, which has continuously maintained its headquarters and library there following minor renovations to the interior and exterior of the building. What is most unusual about the house is the use of brick in its construction, instead of limestone and wood as most houses in Manhattan were built during this time. Platt's brother-in- law, William Harrison Smith, was a builder who also owned a brickyard in nearby Junction City. Although no evidence remains to definitively prove that Smith assisted in any way with the construction of Platt's house, the circumstantial evidence is strong.

The spiritual successor to Pendulo's earlier Hollywood Monsters (1997), it takes place in an alternate-history, 1950s Hollywood where movie monster roles are portrayed by real monsters. The game stars Dan Murray and Liz Allaire, two reporters who stumble across a conspiracy as they cover the film industry. Assuming control of Dan and Liz, the player navigates the game world, converses with non-player characters and solves puzzles. Pendulo began developing The Next Big Thing in the late 2000s. Hollywood Monsters had been a success in Southern Europe, and Pendulo reported consistent fan requests for a sequel in the following years. The company planned The Next Big Thing as a remake, but decided that the original's flaws—both in design and in what the developers retrospectively called its \\"male chauvinist\\" outlook—necessitated an overhaul. As a result, Pendulo reworked the puzzles, game structure, plot and characters; significant time was dedicated to writing the new female protagonist Liz Allaire, to imbue the game with a feminist ethos. The game was produced in roughly 18 months by a team of 12 to 15 people. The Next Big Thing was a commercial bomb upon its initial release for computers. Its performance hurt Pendulo's business relationships and forced the team to rethink its style, resulting in its first fully dramatic title, Yesterday. However, The Next Big Things later port for iOS saw more success. The game's computer version received generally favorable reviews from critics, according to Metacritic. Gameplay mouses over a hotspot. The Next Big Thing is a graphic adventure game set in a 2D environment and controlled with a point-and-click interface. Progression through the game is linear; the story is segmented into discrete scenes, each of which begins with a list of the player's goals at that moment. The player advances the plot by exploring the game world, speaking with non-player characters via dialogue trees, collecting items and solving puzzles. Most puzzles require the player to use or combine items, although minigames and conversation-based puzzles appear as well. The Next Big Thing features three difficulty modes: the lowest offers a hint system and allows the player to highlight all interactive hotspots on the screen; the middle difficulty omits the hint system; and the highest omits both. Plot=Concept and characters= The Next Big Thing takes place in Hollywood during an alternate- history 1950s, in which real monsters act in monster movies. MKO Pictures, run by the monster businessman William A. FitzRandolph, dominates this monster- movie industry. The two player characters are reporters Liz Allaire and Dan Murray of the fictional newspaper The Quill. Dan, described by Destructoid as \\"arrogant and self-destructive\\", is a veteran sportswriter recently demoted to the society pages. Liz is young, wealthy and eager to prove herself as a journalist, but, according to Marca Player, she suffers from \\"every psychic pathology you can imagine, from Asperger syndrome to multiple personalities.\\" Gameblog declared her \\"borderline schizo\\". Liz and Dan share a mutually- hostile, frenemy relationship marked by arguments, insults and traces of romantic attraction. The game's story is told by a narrator whose appearance Europa Press compared to that of actor Sean Connery. He breaks down the player's goals in each leg of the plot, and provides puzzle hints on the lowest difficulty setting. The story features a number of monster characters, such as the Poet of Pain, a large creature who injures himself to gather material for new poems; Big Albert, both muscular and implanted with the brain of a Nobel Prize winner; Professor Fly, a mutant blend of human and fly; Krom- Ha, an undead queen from Egypt; and the Immaterial Man. Robot characters, owned by FitzRandolph, appear as well. The game borrows its premise and a number of plot elements from its predecessor Hollywood Monsters, including the Quill news agency and large sections of that game's first chapter. Liz and Dan fill the roles of Hollywood Monsters protagonists Sue Bergman and Ron Ashman, while Professor Fly, the Poet of Pain and FitzRandolph respectively replace Dr. Fly, Junior and the film producer Otto Hannover from the first game. =Synopsis= The Next Big Thing begins as Liz Allaire and Dan Murray arrive in Hollywood to cover the Horror Movie Awards, which recognize the achievements of monster actors. She interviews celebrities at the theater while he drinks alone in the car. When Liz returns, she sees Big Albert sneaking into the office of William A. FitzRandolph's nearby mansion and decides to investigate; Dan remains behind. Exploring the mansion and meeting with FitzRandolph, Liz comes across two tickets to a boxing match of interest to Dan, which she promises him in exchange for his distracting FitzRandolph and clearing her path to the office. She breaks in to find Big Albert rummaging through FitzRandolph's desk, but he escapes out the window. Deducing that he plans to meet with the Immaterial Man in FitzRandolph's warehouse, Liz activates her tape recorder and walks inside, only to find Big Albert unconscious. The Immaterial Man asks for her help, and she agrees. The next day, Liz has vanished and Dan—still hoping to get the boxing match tickets, and under threat of losing his job at The Quill—looks for clues. He comes across Liz's tape recorder, which reveals that she and the Immaterial Man had hidden Big Albert inside a sarcophagus before being kidnapped by an evil scientist. With Big Albert as his only lead, Dan tracks the sarcophagus to Krom-Ha's temple. By losing his job, using the Poet of Pain's unhinged poetry to answer a Rorschach test and pretending to have only 19 days left to live, he convinces Professor Fly to use him as a test subject for an experimental teleportation device that will take him to Krom-Ha. Once there, he impersonates Amenhotep III and becomes Krom-Ha's lover until he finds a way to access the sarcophagus. He brings Big Albert back to Professor Fly, but discovers that Albert's brain is missing. Meanwhile, FitzRandolph is shown to be in possession of the brain. Liz is now his dinner guest on his private zeppelin: she and the Immaterial Man had been imprisoned by the scientist Dr. Zelssius, FitzRandolph's employee. While Liz plans to escape with the brain, FitzRandolph repeatedly tells her that her mind will change within the hour. She begins to experience headaches, but manages to knock FitzRandolph out and steal the brain, returning to Dan and Professor Fly on a motorcycle. The revived Big Albert explains that FitzRandolph and Dr. Zelssius are using brain implants to control people, moments before FitzRandolph and his robots enter and Liz, revealed to be implanted, comes under his control. Back in his laboratory, Dr. Zelssius straps Dan into a chair and prepares to implant him. With the help of Professor Fly, Dan breaks free, subdues Dr. Zelssius and captures Liz. Her implant snaps when they try to remove it, trapping Liz in her own subconscious mind. She overcomes a series of psychological problems while Dan pumps her for the tickets' location. He then, pretending to be implanted, visits FitzRandolph's headquarters to help Professor Fly free the others subjected to mind control. Dan finds the tickets in Liz's purse, and Liz escapes from Dr. Zelssius's control. It is revealed that FitzRandolph is using those implanted to help his own political campaign, in an effort to combat societal bias against monsters. Bribing the two most infamous monster actors with the tickets, Dan helps Liz shoot a negative political ad that exposes FitzRandolph, who unwittingly airs it and ruins himself. Dan and Liz's scoop gets Dan rehired at The Quill, and a flashforward shows the two as an old married couple: Dan was the unnamed narrator throughout the game. Development Pendulo Studios began planning what would become The Next Big Thing in the late 2000s, during Runaway: A Twist of Fates development. The company's initial idea was to create a high-definition remake of its 1997 title Hollywood Monsters, which had been a hit in Pendulo's home country of Spain. Fan requests for another Hollywood Monsters game had been ongoing for years, and Pendulo had considered the option as early as 1998, only for the project to evolve into Runaway: A Road Adventure (2001). The company dropped further hints of a sequel during Runaways development. Pendulo art director Rafael Latiegui summarized, \\"To each new game that we have been making, the reaction of the Spanish public has been the same: 'When is the next Hollywood Monsters?' \\" This pressure from fans was a key incentive to make The Next Big Thing. Other factors included Pendulo's desire to break away from the Runaway series, and to shorten pre-production and development of its next game by combining a proven concept with the studio's new engine technology. Because the Hollywood Monsters source code and design document were unavailable, Pendulo writer Josué Monchan revisited the game and attempted to \\"reverse- engineer ... the design\\" over the course of two months in 2008. He came to the conclusion that the puzzles, inventory, characters and overall quality fell below current standards. Monchan also believed that the first game was \\"a bit male chauvinist\\" in its use of female characters, particularly Sue Bergman, whom he considered an ornamental, submissive woman whose agency in the plot was vastly overshadowed by that of the male lead. The team later stated that she \\"left a lot to be desired\\" as a character. In one of its first major changes to the Hollywood Monsters formula, Pendulo chose to replace the protagonists. The creators noted that they \\"didn't really dislike HM1 protagonist Ron, but ... decided to leave them [both] in the grave\\". The Next Big Thing gradually grew into a reimagining of Hollywood Monsters, which Latiegui called neither \\"a second part, nor a remake\\". Seeking a format that could attract both newcomers and existing fans, Pendulo built on the foundation of the first game—retaining its core ideas and opening scenes—and developed the story in a new direction. Monchan co-wrote The Next Big Thing with project lead Ramón Hernáez. Their script ultimately topped 500 pages in length. According to Monchan, they conceived a purposely \\"stupid story\\" and focused instead on dialogue and characterization, dedicating significant time to the creation of Sue's replacement Liz Allaire. The team wanted to write a \\"feminist game\\"; Monchan said that Hollywood Monsters male lead \\"had 80% prominence and she 20% ... [but now] she is 60% and he is 40%, and she is the one who takes action\\". He initially struggled to find a direction for Liz's character, until Hernáez suggested borrowing from Katharine Hepburn's role in the screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby, a longtime dream of Monchan's. Monchan also drew from Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's, from Elliot Reid (Scrubs) and Phoebe Buffay (Friends), from his ex-girlfriend, from his \\"craziest\\" real-life acquaintances and from himself. He later called Liz \\"the character from whom I learned the most and with whom I identify the most\\" across his career. Pendulo included allusions to film history in The Next Big Things script and modeled the cast after celebrities and movie characters, traditions at the company. Among the films referenced in the script are Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Blade Runner, Some Like It Hot, Pirates of the Caribbean and American Beauty. William A. FitzRandolph's production company, MKO, is an allusion to the Golden Age film studio RKO Pictures. For the protagonists, Pendulo modeled Dan's appearance on actor Matt Dillon, and Liz's on actresses Charlize Theron and Scarlett Johansson. Latiegui said that they tried to give Liz \\"friendly features and a sexy edge\\" that reflected her personality. According to Europa Press, Big Albert was designed by combining football player Cristiano Ronaldo with Frankenstein's monster. The publication further reported that the Poet of Pain \\"unavoidably recalls\\" the Goonies character Sloth, and cited FitzRandolph's resemblance to reporter Miguel de la Quadra-Salcedo and to the X-Men character Beast. In 2014, Monchan noted that the game's story is itself \\"like the X-Men\\" in its metaphorical exploration of racism, via the prejudice monsters face in the game's universe. While designing The Next Big Thing, Pendulo scrapped Hollywood Monsters inventory system and all of its puzzles. The creators felt that the inclusion of \\"200 items in the inventory\\" at once had aged poorly, Monchan said. They revised the puzzles partly to show the studio's growth since the 1990s, and, according to Pendulo, to offer a fresh experience to players of the original. In response to market demands, the company intentionally lowered the game's difficulty—part of a yearslong trend for its titles. Pendulo later stated, \\"The commercial decline of adventure [games], along with the advent of casual gaming and mobile platforms, led to ever easier adventures being asked of us.\\" The designers also moved away from Hollywood Monsters nonlinear gameplay structure, which they said had caused \\"stagnation\\" for players. Instead, Pendulo tried to streamline the gameplay and increase the speed of the player's progression, to create \\"the feeling that a lot of things are happening at a frenetic pace\\". The team nevertheless continued to use what Monchan called the \\"traditional\\" adventure game format, in contrast to then- recent competitors such as Heavy Rain and L.A. Noire. Production of The Next Big Thing lasted roughly 18 months, having started in the final months of Runaway: A Twist of Fates creation. According to Latiegui, the game was made by a team of 12–15 people, most of whom had worked at Pendulo since Runaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle. He called it a tight-knit group wherein \\"the level of trust and partnership is very high.\\" They developed The Next Big Thing on an upgraded version of A Twist of Fates engine, and graphics were a key focus. Pendulo saw graphical quality as a major selling point for its titles; Monchan later argued that Runaway owed its success in large part to its visuals. The company billed The Next Big Thing as the first 1080p graphic adventure game. Latiegui said that supporting the resolution caused development problems, but that it offered \\"much more freedom\\" to the artists. For the art direction, Pendulo maintained what Latiegui dubbed the company's \\"trademark\\" 2.5D style—originally created for Runaway—that draws from comic books and animated cartoons. The game employs toon shading and, as with the Runaway trilogy, pre- rendered 3D characters. =Promotion and distribution= The Next Big Thing was first announced by Pendulo Studios and publisher Focus Home Interactive in April 2010, and it initially lacked a release date. The Next Big Thing debuted in Germany on February 4, 2011. Releases followed in France on April 7 and in the United States on April 21. As was common for Pendulo titles at the time, the Spanish version came after the game's international debut. It appeared on June 16, a launch date shared with the Italian edition. The Spanish version, published by FX Interactive, was bundled with the original Hollywood Monsters. During the lead-up to the game's release, Pendulo did not publicly tie The Next Big Thing to Hollywood Monsters. Early previews from publications such as Jeuxvideo.com and 3DJuegos called the games similar, but Roberto García of Spain's MeriStation wrote that \\"from Pendulo Studios the answer was always silence\\" regarding the connection. Micromanía reported in early 2011 that the creators had \\"clarified that they are two completely different games.\\" Nevertheless, after The Next Big Things release outside Spain, Rafael Latiegui told MeriStation that the game's \\"real title\\" was Hollywood Monsters 2. The title had not been viable for the international version, he said, because Hollywood Monsters had never been distributed outside Southern Europe. In April 2011, the game was retitled Hollywood Monsters 2 in Spain and Italy. In late 2012, it received an iOS release under the name Hollywood Monsters. The iOS release was localised in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. Reception According to Josué Monchan of Pendulo Studios, The Next Big Thing commercially bombed upon its initial release for computers. He attributed its failure to several issues, including the \\"horrible\\" title and the limited cultural relevance of its monster-based story circa 2011. It was widely pirated in Spain, where sales and illegal downloads of the game were equally matched not long after its release. Nevertheless, Pendulo could not fully determine why the game had underperformed, and in part blamed poor timing. Its low sales hurt the studio's business opportunities, even in its core market of Europe, and Monchan said that Pendulo's publisher lost faith in the team afterward. Pendulo reacted by rethinking its development process and creating its first fully dramatic game, Yesterday. Critically, The Next Big Thing earned \\"generally favorable reviews\\", as calculated by Metacritic. HobbyConsolas reported it as one of the highest-rated Spanish-made games on Metacritic by 2017. Reviewers praised its graphics, characters, story and animations, while some criticized the puzzles, depending on the reviewer they were viewed as too easy or too \\"far-fetched\\" (Destructoid). In Spain, The Next Big Thing was nominated in four categories, including Best Game, at the 2011 annual awards held by the Asociación de Desarrolladores de Ocio Interactivo Digital. It came away with the prizes for Best Sound, Best Graphics and Best Script. The game's four nominations at Spain's National Gamelab Videogame Industry Awards, meanwhile, resulted in four losses to Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. =iOS port= Despite the commercial failure of The Next Big Things computer version, Josué Monchan said that the game's iOS port, Hollywood Monsters, saw much greater success. He called it a \\"moderate hit\\" on the platform, and noted that it had out-earned the computer release as of December 2014. Its success was validating to the game's creators, Monchan remarked, because it led them to believe that The Next Big Things initial low sales were caused by business mistakes rather than the game's quality. Metacritic characterized reviews for the iOS port as \\"mixed or average\\". In 2013, it was nominated for the \\"Excellence in Storytelling\\" prize at the International Mobile Gaming Awards, but lost to The Walking Dead. David Wolinsky of TouchArcade praised Hollywood Monsters production values and called it a \\"rock-solid and fun adventure\\", although he found its comedy \\"hit-or-miss\\" and encountered crash issues not present in the computer version. Writing for HobbyConsolas, David Alonso Hernández hailed the new touchscreen interface as a \\"great fit\\" and arguably a better match than traditional point-and-click controls. He enjoyed the writing, art and puzzles; his biggest complaint was with the loss of the computer version's Spanish-language dub. Conversely, Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer and Brittany Vincent of Slide to Play both called the new touch controls \\"fidgety\\" and imprecise, and dubbed the puzzles illogical. The two reviewers saw Hollywood Monsters as a largely missed opportunity, with an interesting premise bogged down by poor execution.

She was a woman of great energy and drive who believed strongly in the power exerted by women working together. She is known to members of Women's Institutes in the United Kingdom for introducing the concepts and practices of the Canadian Women's Institute movement to Britain in 1914. She is remembered internationally as one of the founding members of the Associated Country Women of the World (ACWW) in 1933. Personal life Madge Robertson Watt was born Margaret Rose Robertson in Collingwood, Ontario, on June 4, 1868. Her father was Henry Robertson Q.C. (1840-1923), son of John and Catherine Robertson of Hamilton. Her mother Bethia (1844-1893) was the daughter of John and Margaret Climie Rose of Bradford. Both parents were Canadian-born children of Scottish emigrants. Her forebears had all emigrated to Simcoe District (now County), Ontario, in the years following the War of 1812, when the land was opened to pioneer farmingHunter, A.F. A history of Simcoe County, published by the County Council, 1909, no ISBN, pp Vol. 1, p.41, Vol 2, p.57. These Scottish pioneers contributed to Madge's genetic makeup, evidenced by her traits of stamina, determination, and persistence. These, combined with her ability to draw women together to develop and advance a common cause, led to her future success as an inspired organizer of Women's Institutes, following the founding of that organization by Adelaide Hoodless in 1897. She liked \\"Madge\\" as the short name for Margaret and used it all her life. She also liked short hair and wore hers that way in spite of the fashion in her early life that dictated otherwise. Madge Robertson, writer, 1893 Madge graduated from the University of Toronto, where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta, in 1890. She was one of the first women to be granted a Master of Arts degree. She earned her living as a Canadian writer, editor, and reviewer in the years between 1890 and 1907. Writing under the name of Madge Robertson, she had many articles published by newspapers and magazines, such as the University of Toronto's The Varsity, the Ladies Pictorial Weekly (she also edited it in 1892), The Globe, some USA titles, and the British Columbia Victoria Times. Ambrose & Hall (2007) hail her as an example of a New Woman because, in her writings, she used ideas from emerging feminist thought.Linda M. Ambrose and Kristin Hall,A new woman in print and practice: The Canadian literary career of Madge Robertson Watt , 1890-1907, History of Intellectual Culture, ISSN 1492-7810, 2007, Vol 7, No 1 She also recognized that most women saw such ideas as being distant from basic family life and ties. Although a believer in marriage reform, Madge became engaged to, and then married, Alfred Tennyson Watt, M.D., and bore two sons, Henry Robertson (Robin) in 1896 and Hugh Sholto (Sholto) in 1906. She continued her writing in William Head, Metchosin, British Columbia, where they lived while Dr Watt carried out his duties as chief medical officer, Superintendent of Quarantine for the Province of British Columbia. She joined the Metchosin Women's Institute in 1909, wrote pamphlets to entice agriculture settlers to Vancouver Island, and became a member of the Senate of the University of British Columbia. She was also appointed to the first Advisory Board of the British Columbia Women's Institute. When Dr Watt died suddenly in 1913, Madge took her two sons to England to complete their education. When World War I broke out, many men left their jobs to join the army and navy, so farm and village women had to do the work they had left behind. Madge realized that a concerted, effective agricultural effort was needed in the country and set about spreading the concepts of Women's Institutes.Fenner, Ruth \\"A Canadian woman of the 20th Century who has made a difference\\" http://www.svanciswomensinstitute.bc.ca/awatt.html Early Women's Institutes in the U.K. Jane Robinson, in A Force to be reckoned with, noted that Adelaide Hoodless had already visited London and spoken about Women's Institutes, the movement she had founded after her son died from drinking contaminated milk.Robinson, Jane,\\"A force to be reckoned with A history of the Women's Institute\\", Virago Press, 2011, , pp. 17, 24-5 The first group of women met together in the Ontario town of Stoney Creek, Canada in 1897. Other WIs formed in Ontario soon after, especially as Hoodless was a good speaker and could inspire women to set up their own small WIs . In 1899, Lady Aberdeen, wife of a former Governor General of Canada, welcomed Hoodless to England and was enthusiastic about the usefulness of such a women's organization. But English women were not willing to take it on at that time. The ideas around Women's Institutes needed the right time and place to take root. With World War I already underway, Madge Watt had the determination and stamina to keep bringing WI concepts to everyone's attention until the Agriculture Organizations Society (AOS) began offering funds. This initiative enabled a group of women to organize in 1915 as the first Women's Institute. They lived in and about the village of Llanfair PG in Wales. With funds from the Agriculture Organizations Society, Madge went on to help a number of WIs to organize quickly, following the success of the Welsh group. By the end of World War I, the movement was credited with being a strong force in agriculture, having increased the food supply from 35% to 60% of the country's requirements.Robinson, Jean M. \\"Three women of B.C. and the A.C.W.W.\\" A project of Shirley Women's Institute Historical Research Group, 1990, p. 35. Madge was a good speaker and able to put her points across clearly. Audience members sometimes said they felt as if she was speaking directly to each individual. Madge continued encouraging women to set up and work within Women's Institutes and helped train workers to carry on the administrative side of the organization. As a superlative organizer, she helped set up the first 100 Institutes and was Chief Organizer under the Board of Agriculture. As Chief Organizer of WIs in Great Britain during World War I, Mrs Watt helped bring over 100 Institutes into being within three years. In this picture, she wears the uniform for Voluntary County Organizers. She developed and presented the first Women's Institute School in Sussex in 1918. The School's aim was to interest and begin to train good administrative staff who would continue to bring on new groups. She wanted women to realize their own talents and skills for this type of work. In her history of women leaders of the ACWW, Jean M. Robinson reproduced an excerpt from the first Women's Institute School manual,Robinson, Jean M. \\"Three women of B.C. and The A.C.W.W.\\" A project of Shirley Women's Institute Historical Research Group - 1990 - inside front page which may have been the words that Madge actually spoke: The ideas behind WI 'schools' helped sustain the training of leaders and administrators, although the short courses ran for many years on a shoestring. In 1917,Gertrude Denman accepted the presidency of the newly established National Federation of Woman's Institutes (NFWI) in the United Kingdom. She, like Madge Watt, was a strong believer in women's abilities to develop leadership and organizational skills. In the years after World War 1, the WI offerings gradually changed into adult education short courses to meet their members' needs. These overnight educationals became well attended once WW2 had ended but the demand for them out-grew the accommodation that could be hired to present them. Jane Robinson described the trials and tribulations that the NFWI experienced while finding, and funding, a permanent home for their popular short courses.Robinson, Jane, \\"A force to be reckoned with A history of the Women's Institute\\", Virago Press, 2011, , pp 203-9. When Lady Denman retired in 1946 as the NFWI President, she agreed to the members' proposal to name their new building Denman College, to mark her on-going support for continuing education for all WI members who wished it. Denman College's success has, in a way, its beginning in the First Women's Institute school in 1918, designed and presented by Madge Watt. Like Denman, Madge often expressed her faith in women's abilities to learn and to use their knowledge to help themselves, their families and their communities. On Madge's return to British Columbia in 1919, she became involved with British Columbia Women's Institutes and was again appointed to the Women's Institute Advisory Board, this time as president. Madge organized the first British Columbia Women's Institute Provincial Convention. She ensured that, from 1924, delegates to the convention rather than government appointees would constitute future Boards. ACWW: International organization for rural women Madge belonged to a number of women's organizations from time to time, including the International Council of Women. From 1919 on, she talked up the idea of an international organization of rural women. From her research, she knew rural women around the world had many of the same problems, and that these were different from urban women's problems. The International Council of Women thought their organization could have a rural women's branch and encouraged its formation. Madge, with others, thought through the implications and eventually decided that a truly independent body was needed. Although a great deal of talk and some personality clashes caused difficulties around this idea, Madge was noted for being able to keep her train of thought and talk above the hubbub.Robinson, Jean M. \\"Three women of B.C. and The A.C.W.W.\\" A project of Shirley Women's Institute Historical Research Group - 1990 - p 38 She worked with the International Council of Women's president, Lady Aberdeen, and with its general secretary, Elsie Zimmern, to organize a first international conference of rural women in 1929. The resulting conference was held in London, England, and provided opportunities for rural women to articulate their views and find commonality across many countries. Many of the same women met again in 2 years' time to continue planning an international organization. In 1933, representatives of 28 agriculture-related women's groups met in Stockholm, Sweden, to consolidate work done at previous meetings. They agreed on the official name for their new world-wide organization for rural women and also agreed on methods of financing, an important part of assuring their future independence.Lamb, B. (ed.) \\"Working with women worldwide: Highlights of 75 years of ACWW\\", The Associated Country Women of the World, 2004, p 8. Thus, The Associated Countrywomen of the World was launched at Stockholm, Sweden. A famous photograph of Madge showed her standing beside a blackboard at this conference with the title of the organization written in English, French, German and Swedish.Robinson, Jean M. \\"Three women of B.C. and The A.C.W.W.\\" A project of Shirley Women's Institute Historical Research Group - 1990 - p.i Madge became its first president and remained in that position until she retired in 1947. In 1936, she traveled around the world and visited many Women's Institutes in a number of countries. Elizabeth Smart, who became a writer in later years, accompanied Madge as her companion and secretary. ACWW logo Madge cooperated and collaborated with many women to dream the dream of an international rural women's organization. She had good ideas that could help the organization become known to women in many countries. These ideas could become expensive, such as the writing, editing and production of an ACWW magazine, The Countrywoman. To help this idea happen quickly, she persuaded her son Sholto to use his skills as a journalist to edit the first few issues. When the nascent organization could not afford to publish an expensive version, The Countrywoman appeared in a smaller, less costly format. Because it filled a need, publication of the magazine has continued and is a part of ACWW media today. The organization also needed a logo, so Madge persuaded her older son Robin, who was an artist, to design the ACWW badge. In 1936, he created the well-known logo, depicted as the 4 compass points, with 2 green circles symbolizing friendship, surrounded by green, the 'carpet' of the Earth. Although Madge Watt had begun her adult career as the writer, Madge Robertson, she never wrote her own story. She was not a person who gathered things for herself. Except for a short period following World War 1, she lived on very little money and moved from one set of rented quarters to another. Over the years, Madge wrote many letters to her younger sister Katie describing her work and travels but did not ask her to keep these. Had the letters, postcards and notes been saved, they would have represented a useful record. Another disappointment to those hoping for contemporary records lies in Elizabeth Smart's published diaries in which Smart wrote only a small amount about the happenings, places and people she met on the tour around the world with Madge Watt.Van Wart, Alice (ed) \\"Necessary secrets The first volume of Elizabeth Smart's journals\\" Paladin - 1992 - pp 93-159 The first detailed biography was published in 2015. Author L.M. Ambrose had to employ sophisticated detective skills to obtain the comprehensive material discussed in the book.Ambrose, L.M. \\"A great rural sisterhood Madge Robertson Watt and the ACWW\\", University of Toronto Press, 2015, 978-1-4426-1579-3 Madge Watt lived in Victoria, British Columbia, during World War II and then lived with son Sholto in Montreal, where she died aged eighty on November 30, 1948. In accord with family wishes, a plain marker was placed on her grave. The Federation of Women's Institutes of Canada has since replaced this marker with a stone bearing the ACWW logo and a commemorative message.Ambrose, L.M. \\"A great rural sisterhood Madge Robertson Watt and the ACWW\\", University of Toronto Press, 2015, 978-1-4426-1579-3, p. 231. Legacy and influence Madge was appointed a Member of the Order of British EmpireRobinson, Jean M. \\"Three women of B.C. and the A.C.W.W.\\", Shirley Women's Institute Historical Research Group, p. 36 by King George V in 1919 for her work in helping establish Women's Institutes in the United Kingdom. With others, Madge founded the Associated Country Women of the World in 1933 to take the concepts to other countries. She recognized that a number of other countries had organizations somewhat similar to the Women's Institutes but, in many cases, these groups required stronger leadership and/or clearer goals. The Women's Institute mission and goals appealed to them, so the women of these countries joined together under the auspices of the Associated Countrywomen of the World and spread the movement around the world. Madge was a visionary who believed that women could, and should, show leadership and help other women realize their potential for good. She did not claim to be the sole founder of the Associated Country Women of the World nor a founder of the Women's Institutes. She was a good communicator and had a strong personality that tended to outshine other members at certain times. The work of the ACWW would never have progressed as it has without many important contributions to its foundation, such as those made by Mrs Godfrey Drage (Finance) and Miss Elsie Zimmern (Secretary) from 1927 on.Lamb, B. \\"Working with women worldwide Highlights of 75 years of ACWW\\". The Associated Country Women of the World. 2004. Pp. 11-2. She received the Order of Agricultural Merit conferred by the governments of France and Belgium. Jean M. Robinson reports that she gained the cooperation of French and Belgian women in spite of their aversion to sharing recipes with anyone, not even their best friends. Under the name 'Mrs Alfred Watt', the Canadian government honoured Madge and the ACWW by issuing a Canadian postage stamp in 1959. The stamp, designed by Helen Fitzgerald Bacon, depicts a kneeling woman tending a green tree surmounted by a globe. Forming the border on three sides are the words, 'Associated Country Women of the World Union Mondiale des Femmes Rurale'. In 1958, the Ontario Government honoured Madge and the Associated Country Women of the World by installing a plaque at the front of the small house in which people thought she had been born in Collingwood.Ambrose, L.M. \\"A great rural sisterhood: Madge Robertson Watt & the ACWW, University of Toronto Press, 2015, 978-1-4426-1579-3, p.220 Long- lost Associated Country Women of the World plaque formerly installed outside the Collingwood house thought to be Madge's 1868 birthplace. At a square metre in size, this handsome plaque was somewhat overpowering in appearance, compared to the modest building behind it. The home owner asked that it be installed in a more appropriate place. It was taken down and stored, but later could not be located. In 1990, a new plaque dedicated to the Associated Country Women of the World was placed near the Collingwood Museum. This plaque disappeared after being damaged. A replacement plaque installed several years later on the grounds of that Museum is still displayed. Another plaque that played a disappearing act was installed in the middle of the Peace Bridge between Canada and the United States of America in 1936. Following the ACWW Third World Conference held in Washington, the delegates went to the Bridge and held an unveiling ceremony complete with a speech by Madge Watt. The plaque was dedicated to the rural women of Canada and the United States of America. In the 1950s, it was taken down when bridge repairs were undertaken but was then misplaced. Members of the Federation of Women's Institutes of Ontario were eventually successful in finding it and having it re-installed and re-dedicated at the ACWW 23rd Triennial Conference in June, 2001. The ceremony included a re-enactment of Madge's 1936 speech.Lamb, B. (ed) 2004 \\"Working with women worldwide Highlights of 75 years of the ACWW\\", London: Associated Country Women of the World, p. 12 British Columbia WI historian Ruth Fenner notes that the Associated Country Women of the World now have non- governmental status at the United Nations and that ACWW representatives speak at international meetings held to decide how rural families can be helped. The ACWW's current UN status is entirely in keeping with Madge's insistence that women should make their own rules, rather than conforming to those set by men. The resulting strength of the ACWW organization lies in its emphasis on women's wellbeing through education and learning, resulting in the wellbeing of their families and thus of the nation in which they live. The British Columbia Women's Institutes unveiled a plaque at Colwood, BC, on August 14, 2015, eight years after the Canadian Government formally recognized Madge Watt's work. Margaret Robertson Watt was named a Person of National Historic Significance by the Canadian government in 2007. A plaque honoring this designation was unveiled at Colwood, British Columbia on August 14, 2015. Several plantings keep Madge's memory green: #a flowering crabapple tree in Beacon Hill Park, Victoria, Vancouver Island, #an avenue of lime trees in the grounds of Denman College (the National Federation Of Women's Institutes' short-stay residential college), Oxfordshire, paid for by donations by WI members, #a memorial picnic shelter in the International Peace Gardens near the Canada–US border, erected by the Manitoba Women's Institutes. As author Jane Robinson has stated: \\"It is clear that at certain periods in its history the Women's Institute appears to have lost its way. No doubt there are problems ahead. But it was never in danger of collapsing, and it won’t for a very long time because, at its core, working quietly and behind the scenes, are the women for whom and by whom it was created... supportive ‘sisters’ are still meeting together in villages and towns across the country to make the world a better place.\\"Robinson, Jane,\\"A force to be reckoned with A history of the Women's Institute\\", Virago Press, 2011, , p 260 Madge Watt believed in ‘supportive sisters’ and knew that women could contribute to a better world. Her vision of women coming together in their own villages and working on common goals, both locally and internationally, far transcended her well- documented character faults and idiosyncrasies.Robinson, Jane,\\"A force to be reckoned with A history of the Women's Institute\\", Virago Press, 2011, , pp 29-31 She was a builder who believed in the power of women working together regardless of race, religion or nationality. She believed in women's rights to higher education, access to careers, and opportunities to express their own individuality through use of their skills and talents. She helped many women broaden their horizons without upsetting their family connections or breaking their ties.

After redistricting, Fithian, the three term incumbent of Indiana's 2nd congressional district, decided to run for Secretary of State of Indiana, but withdrew from the primary to ultimately run for the United States Senate. He challenged fellow Democrat and one term Indiana State Senator Michael Kendall of Jasper, Indiana, who Fithian earlier encouraged to run for the Senate. Kendall, who represented Indiana's 47th Senate district and formed the Notre Dame Students for Robert F. Kennedy organization during the 1968 presidential election, was seen a young progressive alternative to Fithian, who he called the \\"ideological twin of Richard Lugar.\\" After the bitterly contested primary, Fithian prevailed over Kendall, winning with 59% of the vote. = Results = Republican primary = Candidates = *Richard Lugar, incumbent U.S. Senator = Results = Incumbent United States Senator Richard Lugar won the republican nomination in an uncontested primary on May 4, 1982.

These raids began after Crimea became independent about 1441 and lasted until the peninsula came under Russian control in 1774. Their main purpose was the capture of slaves, most of whom were exported to the Ottoman slave markets in Constantinople or elsewhere in the Middle East. Genoese and Venetians merchants controlled the slave trade from Crimea to Western Europe. The raids were a drain of the human and economic resources of eastern Europe. They largely inhabited the \\"Wild Fields\\" – the steppe and forest-steppe land which extends from a hundred or so miles south of Moscow to the Black Sea and which now contains most of the Russian and Ukrainian population. The campaigns also played an important role in the development of the Cossacks. Estimates of the number of people affected vary: Polish historian Bohdan Baranowski assumed that in the 17th century century Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (present-day Poland, Ukraine and Belarus) lost an average of 20,000 yearly and as many as one million in all years combined from 1474 to 1694. Mikhail Khodarkhovsky estimates that 150,000 to 200,000 people were abducted from Russia in the first 50 years of the 17th century. The first major raid occurred in 1468 and was directed into the south-eastern border of Poland. The last raid into Hungary took place in 1717. In 1769 a last major Tatar raid, which took place during the Russo-Turkish War, saw the capture of 20,000 slaves. Causes=Economic factors= Most of the raids fell on territory of today's Russia and Ukraine – lands previously divided between Muscovy and Lithuania, although some fell on Moldavia and Circassia (North Caucasus). A considerable part of the male population of Crimea took part in these campaigns. The main economic goal of the raids was booty, some of it material, but most of it human. These human trade goods were mostly sold on to the Ottoman Empire, although some remained in Crimea. Slaves and freedmen formed approximately 75% of the Crimean population.Slavery. Encyclopædia Britannica. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, \\"It is known that for every slave the Crimeans sold in the market, they killed outright several other people during their raids, and a couple more died on the way to the slave market.\\" The main slave market was Caffa which after 1475 was part of the coastal strip of Crimea that belonged to the Ottomans. In the 1570s close to 20,000 slaves a year went on sale in Caffa.Halil Inalcik. \\"Servile Labor in the Ottoman Empire\\" in A. Ascher, B. K. Kiraly, and T. Halasi-Kun (eds), The Mutual Effects of the Islamic and Judeo-Christian Worlds: The East European Pattern, Brooklyn College, 1979, pp. 25–43. =Political factors= The Crimean Khanate in about 1600. Note that the areas marked Poland and especially Muscovy were claimed rather than administered and were thinly populated. The Crimean Khanate broke off from the Golden Horde in 1441. When the Horde came to an end in 1502 the buffer between Crimea and its northern neighbors disappeared. The Khans took advantage of the conflicts between Lithuania and Moscow, allying now with one, then with the other, and using the alliance with one as a justification to attack the other. During the Russo-Lithuanian War of 1500–1506 the Crimeans were allied with Russia and penetrated deep into Lithuania. Relations soon deteriorated. Near continuous raids on Muscovy began in 1507. Crimean Khan Devlet I Giray burnt down Moscow during the 1571 campaign. Contemporaries counted up to 80,000 victims of the Tatar invasion in 1571, with 150,000 Russians taken as captives. Ivan the Terrible, having learnt that Crimean Khanate army was approaching Moscow, fled from Moscow to Kolomna with his oprichniks. After the burning of Moscow, Devlet Giray Khan, supported by the Ottoman Empire, invaded Russia again in 1572. A combined force of Tatars and Turks, however, this time they were repelled in the Battle of Molodi. In July–August, the 120,000-strong Tatar horde was also defeated by the Russian army, led by Prince Mikhail Vorotynsky and Prince Dmitriy Khvorostinin. In 1620 Tatars took part in the Battle of Cecora, where they vastly contributed to the crushing victory of the Turks over the Poles-Lithuanians. In 1672 Khan Selim I Giray was assigned to join Ottoman army during the Polish–Ottoman War (1672–76) in which he was successful in the conquest of Bar. Military Great Abatis Border by Max Presnyakov (2010). The border was created by Russia to protect it from the Crimean-Nogai raiders who, rapidly moving along the Muravsky Trail, ravaged the southern provinces of the country. =Theater of war= At the beginning of this period, between the Crimean Khanate and the Duchy of Moscow lay almost 700 miles of thinly populated grassland, the so-called Wild Fields. The Oka River, 40 miles south of Moscow, was both the principal and last line of defense. It was guarded by the Beregovaya Sluzhba (\\"river-bank service\\"). This continued to exist even after the construction of the Belgorod Line far to the south. Its troops rarely crossed the Oka, even when there were massive attacks on the fortresses to the south. Between Muscovy and Crimea there were three main routes also known as trails. To avoid fords they generally followed the high ground between one river basin and another. =In Crimea and Turkey= The main slave market was at Caffa which after 1475 belonged to the Ottoman Empire. The town had artillery and a strong garrison of Janissaries. Besides Caffa, slaves were sold in Karasubazar, Tuzleri, Bakhchysarai and Khazleve. Slave dealers came from various backgrounds: Turks, Arabs, Greeks, Armenians and others. For the right to trade they paid tax to the Crimean Khan and Turkish Pasha. In Caffa there were sometimes as many as 30,000 slaves, mostly from Muscovy and the southeastern lands of the Commonwealth. Habsburg diplomat and the ambassador of the Holy Roman Empire to Muscovy, Sigismund von Herberstein, wrote that \\"old and infirmed men, who will not fetch much at a sale, are given up to the Tatar youths, either to be stoned, or to be thrown into the sea, or to be killed by any sort of death they might please.\\" According to Ukrainian-Canadian historian Orest Subtelny, \\"from 1450 to 1586, eighty-six raids were recorded, and from 1600 to 1647, seventy. Although estimates of the number of captives taken in a single raid reached as high as 30,000, the average figure was closer to 3000...In Podilia alone, about one- third of all the villages were devastated or abandoned between 1578 and 1583.\\" Michalo Lituanus described Caffa as \\"an insatiable and lawless abyss, drinking our blood.\\" Besides the bad food, water, clothing and shelter, they were subjected to exhausting labor and abuse. According to Litvin \\"the stronger slaves were castrated, others had their noses and ears slit and were branded on the forehead or cheek. By day they were tormented with forced labor and at night kept in dungeons.\\" Muslim, Armenians, Jews, and Greek traders all purchased Slavic slaves in Caffa.

It was carved out of the Vadodara district on 26 January 2013 with its headquarters at Chhota Udaipur town and is the 28th district of Gujarat. Establishment The district consists of the six talukas of Chhota Udepur, Pavi Jetpur, Kawant, Naswadi, Sankheda and the newly created Bodeli taluka. The district headquarters is located at Chhota Udepur. The district was created to facilitate decentralisation and ease of access to government services. Its creation, announced in the run up to the Assembly elections in Gujarat in 2012, was also seen by the media and political analysts as a government strategy to attract tribal votes. Description Chhota Udaipur shares its borders with the state of Madhya Pradesh. Chhota Udaipur district has a forest area of 75,704 hectares and has deposits of dolomite, fluorite, granite and sand all of which are mined. The district is also home to a large dairy industry. Chhota Udaipur is a tribal dominated district, and the district headquarters is located 110 km away from Vadodara. Chhota Udaipur is the third tribal dominated district in eastern Gujarat after the Narmada and Tapi districts. Chhota Udaipur, once a princely state of Gujarat lies in the heart of a tribal area with rich indigenous history and culture which is more representative of the region than palaces. The town is a good base from which to explore the surrounding tribal villages, particularly in the Rathwa communities. The Rathwa tribals who live here produce the Pithora mural paintings by mixing colours with liquour and milk and then using it to depict intricate motifs and scenes on the walls of their village dwellings. The Tribal Museum here displays a nice collection of people and culture of this place. Every Saturday there is a tribal market which is a hub for local artisans making pithoda paintings and terracotta horses.http://www.gujarattourism.com/destination/details/9/158 Chhota Udaipur town sits on the edge of a big lake, with a series of temples along the skyline.

Leslie (Les) Hoffman, (1906 – June 24, 1971), was the founder and CEO of Hoffman Radio in 1941, which in 1948 changed its name to Hoffman Radio and Television. In the 1950s he formed Hoffman Electronics Corporation, based in El Monte, California, consisting of several electronic divisions involved with consumer, industrial and military products. He was married to Elaine Stevely Hoffman (1906–1989). Together, in 1954 they formed the H. Leslie Hoffman and Elaine S. Hoffman Foundation, Pasadena, a philanthropic organization. He and his wife Elaine were large donors and supporters of the University of Southern California (USC) and were directly involved with its growth, academic growth and stature. Served on the Board of Trustees at USC for 17 years.  Period before Hoffman Radio  Between 1929 and 1931 a company called Mission Bell Radio Manufacturing Company was formed. They were based in Los Angeles and specialized in low-cost midget radio receivers. To keep cost down Mission Bell would buy as many prefabricated parts as possible and made a few design changes to established radio chassis to avoid legal action. It was a company that was always in financial problems throughout the 1930s. By 1941 the company filed for bankruptcy. In 1941 Les Hoffman, then a fluorescent lamp salesman, came to the Mission Bell Radio Office to collect an overdue debt. The doors were locked and they were closed for good. Finding out the company went bankrupt, he decided to buy Mission Bell Radio and continue to make radios under the name Hoffman Radio. The company would remain in Los Angeles.  Hoffman Radio and Television  One of Hoffman Radio's first products, the Model A203, sold from 1946 to 1947. One of the last Mission Bell Radio products, it was first sold as a Mission Bell brand then rebranded as a Hoffman Radio. For a short while Hoffman would continue the Mission Bell Radio name and designs. By 1947 Hoffman started designing their own models. About 1948–1949, Hoffman began manufacturing television receivers, since RCA made their television patents royalty-free. He aggressively marketed his product regionally, trying to maintain a good regional reputation and recognizable brand name. By 1950 Time magazine writes about Les Hoffman's achievements in making Hoffman Radio and Television the largest west coast producer of televisions. In two years (1948-1950) Hoffman Radio and Television sales went from $3.5 million to almost $12 million. One of the reason for Les Hoffman's success was in the quality of his products. Hoffman radios and televisions were built well, using proven engineering practices and sometimes applying practices used in military electronics. Hoffman moved into color television slowly and by the late 1960s had a full line of consumer products. Hoffman would continue making televisions until 1977. Original company logo Hoffman used on its products = Hoffman Easy Vision television = When Les Hoffman entered the television manufacturing business, he was a newcomer. He needed to keep his costs down and did not have the resources like the established companies such as Zenith or Philco. After World War II ended, there was considerable surplus materials that needed to be cleared out of company and government stores. Television picture tubes require a protective safety glass in front of it to prevent injury if the picture tube imploded. Hoffman found large quantities of yellow Plexiglas used in aircraft. Since it was low price he bought large quantities. However, the television viewing area had a yellow- green tint to it. During the early years of television there was considerable concerns that long term viewing television could damage one's eyesight due to eye strain. Hoffman took advantage of this scare by advertising that the yellow-green tinted screen reduced eye strain. He marketed his televisions as \\"Easy Vision\\". Les Hoffman definitely was a shrewd and market-savvy businessman.  Hoffman Electronics Corporation  Vanguard 1, launched in 1958, was the first major application of the use of photovoltaic (solar) cells as a source of energy. The panels or arrays consisted of solar cells made by Hoffman Electronics, Semiconductor Division. From 1950 to 1960 Hoffman became diversified, through startups and acquisitions of consumer, industrial and military electronics firms. The company reorganized into Hoffman Electronics Corporation, based in El Monte, California, about 15 miles (24 km) east of Los Angeles. Several divisions were formed, of which the most prominent were: * Consumer Products (Hoffman Radio and Television) * Semiconductor Products * Military Products Since the early days of World War II Hoffman produced for the military various items, such as radar, communications, countermeasures, navigation and ASW equipment.Communications problems? // Aviation Week & Space Technology, May 2, 1960, v. 72, no. 18, p. 142. =A pioneer of solar cells = The invention of the transistor in 1948 must have had an effect on Leslie Hoffman. In the early 1950s, he took a major interest in solar cells, also called photovoltaic cells. When Bell Labs introduced the solar cell to the world in 1951 it was only a curiosity. It had a very poor light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 2 percent, and was very fragile and expensive to fabricate. Several manufacturers, including Hoffman, managed to improve the efficiency to 4.5 percent by 1954, but photovoltaic cells were still impractical. Solar Radio (1959), running on batteries or with a Hoffman solar cell array on the top. Hoffman made great strides in making the solar cell a practical and useful source of renewable energy. From 1957 to 1960, he improved its efficiency from 4.5 to 14 percent and lowered the production cost to make it a marketable item. One of Hoffman's great achievements was the first satellite to be powered by solar cells, the Vanguard 1, launched in 1958. The solar arrays or panels are Hoffman photovoltaic cells. In 1959 H. Leslie Hoffman received the David Packard Medal of Achievement for innovation. In 1959 he was one of the board of directors for the Electronic Industries Association (EIA). The success of Vanguard 1 led Hoffman to broaden the use of his solar cells into other products and applications. In 1959, the launch of the U.S. satellite Explorer 6 had solar arrays using 9,600 Hoffman solar cells. Hoffman's Consumer Products Division introduced a transistor radio line that operated with solar cells or batteries. The four models they produced were the P-411 Solaradio (1956), the P-706 Trans Solar radio (1959), the P-709X (1961), and the 719 (1965). = Leader in air navigation systems = Hoffman Electronics Military Division specialized in air navigation, communications and radar systems. Most of the work and design was done in El Monte, California. In 1957 Hoffman Electronics became a leader in designing airborne navigation systems, called Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN). It is a series of ground- or ship-based transmitter and receiver stations that can provide bearing, slant distance and other related information to any aircraft sending the correct frequency and code. It became a standard navigation system used in U.S. military aircraft, including the U.S. Space Shuttle program. Parts of TACAN can be used for civil aircraft to providing bearing, distance and landing approaches. The development of the Global Positioning System (GPS) will eventually displace TACAN. In the 1960s the Military Products Division continued to grow. They advertised in newspapers, magazines and nearby universities, recruiting engineering students to consider Hoffman as an engineering career. The El Monte site was located near major engineering universities in the Los Angeles County area. Within 20 miles (32 km) circle there was California Institute of Technology (Caltech); University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); University of Southern California (USC); California State University, Long Beach (Long Beach State); California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly); and Loyola University.http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/266/1/letters.pdf Hoffman Electronics advertisement in the late 1960s from a Caltech magazine, describing the Military Products Division and what skills they need. = Relationship with science fiction writer Isaac Asimov = The February 1962 edition of Scientific American, published a short story by acclaimed American science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. The title of the work was \\"My Son, the Physicist\\". The work was commissioned by Hoffman Electronics. The story later became part of a collection of Asimov short stories called Nightfall and Other Stories in 1969.  Hoffman Electronics Corporation after 1977  Six years after Les Hoffman's death in 1971, the board of directors decided to sell the corporation. Gould Electronics purchased most of the divisions in 1978. Gould Electronics was mainly interested in the Military Products Division, which it retained. All other groups were closed or sold. In 1988 the Military Products Division became an independent company called NavCom Defense Electronics Inc. with its home office in El Monte (later moved to Corona). Their Web site still links their roots in Hoffman Electronics. Hoffman Video Systems was the only segment of Hoffman Electronics Corporation that remained with the Les Hoffman legacy. Les Hoffman's son-in-law, J. Kristoffer Popovich, formed Hoffman Video Systems with Robert Jablonski in 1978. Their goal was to supply video products and consultation for industrial and commercial applications. Their home base was in Glendale, but had operations throughout the US. The company remains in business . The business was purchased by Anderson Video.  Philanthropic work  In September 1954, the H. Leslie Hoffman and Elaine S. Hoffman Foundation was formed. Its purpose was to advance education and education activities. The largest benefactor was the University of Southern California. Their donations and matching contributions totaled over $2.5 million over the years and help shape the future of USC. Major areas of support are in business and medicine. Two buildings are named after them. At the USC Marshall School of Business there is the H. Leslie Hoffman Hall. The Elaine S. Hoffman Medical Research Center is at the school of medicine. After the death of her parents, Jane Hoffman Popovich and her husband, J. Kristoffer Popovich, continue the tradition and remain actively involve in the academic growth and stature of USC. Both are USC graduates (Jane Hoffman, BS 1965 and J. Popovich, BS 1965 and MBA 1970). The Jane Hoffman Popovich and J. Kristoffer Popovich Hall at the USC Marshall School of Business is named in their honor.  Family notes  After Les Hoffman died, his wife Elaine continued their involvement of the foundation until her death on August 5, 1989. She was an active donor and supporter of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and the Pasadena Art Museum. Les and Elaine Hoffman had one daughter, Jane Hoffman, who married J. Kristoffer Popovich. As stated earlier, Popovich would run Hoffman Video Systems as a separate company after the Gould Electronics purchase of Hoffman Electronics in 1977. Two buildings at the University of Southern California bear the Hoffman name. At the USC Marshall School of Business there is the H. Leslie Hoffman Hall. At the school of medicine there is the Elaine S. Hoffman Medical Research Center. Les Hoffman, a resident of San Marino, California, died abroad in 1971, in Zürich, Switzerland; Elaine S. Hoffman died August 1985 in San Marino. Both are interred at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.

The vessel operated with the New York Central Railroad from its completion until its retirement in 1969. In 1982, it was moved to dry land at Bourne, Massachusetts, where it remained as a local attraction until it was dismantled in 2006. History Tugboat 16 was a non-condensing steam-powered tug built in 1924 by the Jersey Drydock & Transportation Company in Camden, New Jersey. She operated in the car float industry in New York Harbor until 1969, when she was retired and stored at the Witte Marine scrapyard along Arthur Kill on Staten Island. In the early 1980s, a restaurant owner from Bourne, Massachusetts, was looking for an attention-grabbing attraction for his restaurant which was located alongside Belmont Circle, near the Bourne Bridge. Several retired tugs were inspected and Tugboat 16 was deemed to be most worthy to be displayed on land. The tug was then moved to another yard to get prepared for a tow to Boston, where her bottom was cut off at the waterline and she was placed on a barge with the deckhouse and pilothouse removed. Then, the barge was towed to Buzzards Bay where Tugboat 16 was transferred onto house-moving flatbeds and moved to Belmont Circle, adjacent to Grandma's Restaurant. For the next twenty-four years Tugboat 16 sat at the bottom of the Route 25, Route 28, and Route 6 access ramp to the Bourne Bridge, serving as an ice cream shop and a local tourist attraction. On 2 July 2006, the tugboat was demolished because of the building of a CVS Pharmacy and car park on the site. The pilothouse and stack were moved to a museum in Kingston, New York.

Early life Mathews was frightened of the ocean as a child and spent his childhood visits with family to the ocean sitting on the beach. Later he grew up surfing at Maroubra, New South Wales with fellow Bra Boys the Abberton brothers and his ambition was to become a big wave surfer. Big waves His first surfing of big waves occurred at Shipstern Bluff which saw him featured in photos and videos and gave him his start as a professional when sponsors were attracted. Mathews transition to big waves has seen him carve a niche in the sport as one of the top big wave surfers in the world. Mathews has surfed many of the world's heaviest and biggest waves including Cape Fear, NSW, Teahupoo, Tahiti, Jaws, Maui and The Right, WA He has won three Oakley Big Wave Awards. 2009 Biggest Wave Ridden 2010 Biggest Slab Award 2011 Biggest Wave Ridden Red Bull Cape Fear 2014 Mathews and fellow professional surfer Ryan Hipwood organised the first Red Bull Cape Fear event in August 2014. The contest is an invitational event with 20 of the world's top big wave specialists from Australia and overseas. Due to its location spectators cannot watch the event but it is broadcast live and free. Film and Television There have been several films that Matthews has been involved in as himself. In 2007 Matthews appeared in Bra Boys : Blood is thicker than water , \\"A film about the cultural evolution of the Sydney beach side suburb of Maroubra and the social struggle faced by its youth - the notorious surf gang known as the Bra Boys.\\" Fighting Fear (2011) is a documentary involving the friendship of Mathews and Richie Vaculik and the competition between them. Several well known surf stars including Mick Fanning and Kelly Slater also appear as themselves. Another documentary entitled Immersion the Movie (2012) which was 7 years in the making looked at the journey of surfing. Tom Carroll and Kelly Slater are among the many surfers who also appear. Waveform a short appeared in 2015. Also in 2015 Matthews appeared in an episode of a series Focus: What Drives the World's Top Athletes which featured athletes from many different sports. He also featured in an episode of ABC's Australian Story called Scared Straight about a documentary being produced about the Bra Boys. He appeared in episodes of The Crew with Richie Vaculik and Macario De Souza. Mathews appeared in two Australian big wave films featuring Kelly Slater, Journey and Encoded (2014).  Major injury  On 25 October 2016 Matthews was working on a photographic shoot on the south coast of New South Wales when he was injured. He was being double towed in 6–8 foot waves when he was caught in a wave and landed feet first on a reef. He suffered, \\" a broken leg, a dislocated knee, two snapped ligaments, major nerve damage, and an artery that tore lengthways, filling his leg with blood\\" and he was fortunate not to have his leg amputated. In an interview in February 2017 Matthews admitted that the injury may end his career as doctors had advised that nerve damage may stop him from surfing in his usual style. Matthews hopes to one day surf again and is undergoing physiotherapy, yoga and foundation training. He suffers from drop foot which means he can no longer lift one foot and is hoping to use a custom built brace to assist with this disability. A custom built knee brace is also being designed to assist him in the water.

He served as Governor of Maui from 1874 to 1876, Minister of Finance from 1876 to 1878 and again from 1883 to 1886, Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1878 to 1880, Postmaster General from 1881 to 1883 and Collector General of Customs from 1886 to 1887. From 1874 to 1875, he accompanied King Kalākaua on his state visit to the United States to negotiate the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. In 1882, he traveled to Tokyo as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of Japan to negotiate Japanese immigration to Hawaii.  Early life and family  Born on October 2, 1843, at Lāhainā, on the island of Maui, Kapena was the son of Mākini and High Chiefess Nāʻawa, a relative of the Kalākaua family. He was adopted under the Hawaiian custom of hānai by his uncle Jonah Kapena, an influential statesman, judge and royal advisor since the reign of King Kamehameha III (r. 1825–1854). Kapena was educated at the Royal School and later at the Oahu College (now Punahou School). In 1863 he married Emma Aʻalailoa Malo (1846–1886), the only daughter of early Native Hawaiian historian and Christian minister David Malo and his third wife Rebecca Lepeka. Emma was an accomplished musician and composer and served as an attendant of Princess Liliʻuokalani. Emma died unexpectedly from heart disease on April 18, 1886, at the age of 39.; ; ; ; They had one daughter, Alexandrina Leihulu Kapena (1868–1914). On November 5, 1887, Leihulu married Morris Kahai Keohokālole of Maui. She later divorced Keohokālole and married Henry N. Clark after he divorced his wife Emma Dreier. Leihulu owned property on Hawaii and the mainland United States. She died on March 23, 1914, while living in San Francisco, California. She was the last lineal descendant of David Malo.; ; Leihulu died intestate and her estate was disputed between her widower and her two next of kin: Samuel I. Maikai and David U. K. Maikai (grandsons of John William Elliott Maikai). The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled in favor of her widower as her sole heir.  Editor  In 1870, Kapena became the editor of the newspaper Ke Au Okoa, which ran from 1865 until it merged with Ka Nupepa Kuokoa to become Ka Nupepa Kuokoa Me Ke Au Okoa I Huiia in 1873.  Political career = Earlier career = John Mākini Kapena (far right) with John Lot Kaulukoʻu (far left) and three Hawaiian students in San Francisco en route to Japan and China, 1882 During the reign of Kamehameha V (r. 1864–1872), he was commissioned on January 16, 1864, as first lieutenant of the 1st Company of the Yeomanry, a volunteer army regiment in the military of Hawaii. When King Lunalilo ascended to the throne in 1873, Kapena was appointed to a number of political positions. He was appointed to the Board of Education on January 23. He was made a colonel on the king's personal military staff on January 27, and judge of the first circuit court on the island of Oahu, serving in the latter position from April 1, 1873, to July 13, 1874. In July 1873, King Lunalilo and his foreign minister Charles Reed Bishop considered a proposal to cede Pearl Harbor to the United States in exchange for a reciprocity treaty. Although he was in favor of the reciprocity treaty, Kapena gave a speech in front of 1500 Hawaiians at Kaumakapili Church opposing the cessation of Hawaiian territory. = Patronage by Kalākaua = Lunalilo died without an heir in 1874. In the election that followed, Kapena supported his relative David Kalākaua's candidacy for the vacant throne against Queen Emma, the dowager queen of Kamehameha IV (r. 1855–1864). The choice of Kalākaua by the legislature, and the subsequent announcement, caused a riot at the courthouse. US and British troops were landed, and some of Emma's supporters were arrested.; As part of his first round of political appointments, Kalākaua appointed Kapena as a member of the Privy Council of State and the Governor of Maui, succeeding Paul Nahaolelua, who had resigned the governorship to become Minister of Finance. Kapena served as Governor of Maui from February 23, 1874 until December 15, 1876, when he too resigned the governorship to become Minister of Finance. He was succeeded by William Luther Moehonua as governor.; On January 10, 1876, Kapena was appointed by the king to be an official member of the House of Nobles, the upper chamber of the legislature.; As a member of the House of Nobles, Kapena served in every legislative session between 1876 and 1886. From November 17, 1874, to February 15, 1875, Kapena was a member of the Reciprocity Commission and traveled with Kalākaua on his state visit the United States to negotiate the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. Kapena held various important cabinet positions during Kalākaua's reign. In 1876, Kapena was appointed to the king's cabinet as Minister of Finance serving alongside three Americans: Henry A. P. Carter, Minister of Foreign Affairs; John Mott-Smith, Minister of the Interior; and Alfred S. Hartwell, Attorney General. He served as the finance minister from December 5, 1876, until Kalākaua demanded the resignation of his entire cabinet in the middle of the night on July 1, 1878. It was widely suspected that Kalākaua's sudden replacement of his cabinet was influenced by American businessman Claus Spreckels, who had refinanced the King's debts the night before in order to secure water rights for his sugarcane plantation on Maui. On July 3, Kapena was appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in a new cabinet with Samuel Gardner Wilder, Minister of the Interior; Simon Kaloa Kaʻai, Minister of Finance; and Edward Preston, Attorney General. Kapena became the first Native Hawaiian to hold the post of foreign minister and the only minister to survive the political shakeup. He held this post from July 3, 1878, to August 14, 1880. During his tenure, the elders (na elemakule) of Tabiteuea in the Gilbert Islands requested annexation to Hawaii. However, Kapena and the king wrote back declining the request due to its political impractically. When the king chose a new cabinet in 1880, Kapena was replaced in the position by the Italian adventurer Celso Caesar Moreno to the vehement opposition of the diplomatic corps and political leaders in Honolulu. Kapena later returned to another cabinet headed by Walter Murray Gibson when he was appointed Minister of Finance for a second term in February 1883 after Kaʻai was removed for \\"dereliction of ministerial duty.\\" He served as finance minister until June 30, 1886, although Minister of the Interior Charles T. Gulick served as acting finance minister while he was attending the Louisville Exposition in 1885 as Special Commissioner. He was succeeded by Paul P. Kanoa. He also served as the Postmaster General from 1881 to 1883 and the Collector General of Customs from 1886 to 1887. Other political posts and appointments he held during his political career included Marshal of the Household, member of the Board of Education, Commissioner of Boundaries for Maui, Commissioner of Crown Lands, Commissioner to Codify and Revise Laws and Registrar of Conveyances for Oahu. In 1872, he was appointed as the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of Japan. Along with his secretary John Lot Kaulukoʻu, he traveled to Japan to negotiate the prospect of Japanese immigration to the Hawaiian Islands. As part of the Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad governmental program, Kapena also escorted three Hawaiian students to study in Asia. James Kapaa was placed in a school in Canton, China, and James Hakuole and Isaac Harbottle were placed in schools in Japan. Kapena was decorated with a number of Hawaiian and foreign orders and honors. He was made a Knight Companion of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I, a Grand Officer of the Royal Order of the Crown of Hawaii and a Grand Officer of the Royal Order of Kalākaua. He was also accorded the foreign honors of the Grand Cross of the Order of the Rising Sun of Japan, Grand Officer of the Order of the Cross of Takovo of Serbia, Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown of Prussia, Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Japan and the Belgian Red Cross.  Death  In 1887, Kapena resigned his last political post as Collector General of Customs. Kapena died at his residence at Peleula, Honolulu, on October 23, 1887, at the age of 44. Kapena's funeral at St. Andrew's Cathedral the following day was attended by the King, members of the royal family, ranking members of the government and Honolulu society, Viscount Torii and T. Fujita of the Japanese legation, the Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie and the Hawaiian Lodge No. 21, F. & A. M., where he was a member. His service was conducted entirely in Hawaiian by Anglican Reverend Alexander Mackintosh with Reverend H. H. Gowen also in the chancel. His daughter Leihulu served as the chief mourner. After the service, a funeral procession brought the hearse carrying his casket to Kawaiahaʻo Church where he was buried with Masonic rites. Kapena was buried next to his wife Emma Malo and his hānai father Jonah Kapena in the Kapena family plot. His grave marker reads, \\"J. M. Kapena Died Oct 23 1887.\\" Other relatives interred there include Umiuimi, David Kalu and Kahoihoi Pahu.

Use Annually, people camp in the forest to harvest and cook the nuts of karuka (both Pandanus julianettii and Pandanus brosimos). Many normal words are thought to be unhealthy for the plants, as they carry associations inimical to the proper growth of the nuts. An elaborate vocabulary of up to a thousand words and phrases has developed to replace the taboo vocabulary. The new vocabulary focuses on words involved with trips to harvest karuka nuts, and changes as words become known outside an area. The language is often spoken to control the claimed magical properties of the higher elevations where the karuka grows, and to placate dangerous nature spirits like Kita-Menda (also called ), the ritual keeper of the wild dogs. Pandanus language generally should never be used outside the area where the trees grow, for fear of mountain spirits hearing it and coming down to investigate. All ages and genders are expected to know the ritual language before entering the taboo areas, but outsiders who do not know the language may be allowed to speak Tok Pisin instead. As Tok Pisin has become more widely spoken in the area, pandanus languages have been spoken less. Newer generations also seem to be less afraid of the deep forest, and do not see much need for the protective talk. The Kewa and Imbongu pandanus languages are already thought to be dying out. Structure The grammar and vocabulary of pandanus language is based on the mother tongue, but a restricted and consolidated form, especially for names of living organisms. Often words are grouped into umbrella terms which do not have an equivalent concept in ordinary speech. Pandanus language words can also be loanwords from other languages. 'Karuka,' as a term, is not treated consistently across all pandanus languages. For example, in ordinary Kewa language it is aga, but in the Kewa pandanus language it is rumala agaa. Conversely, in both ordinary Kalam language and its pandanus register, the word is the same: . Languages with Pandanus registers Pandanus registers have been best documented for: *Imbongu *Kalam *Kewa *Kobon *Melpa *Mendi *Taiap The Kalam pandanus language, called () or (), is also used when eating or cooking cassowary, as opposed to speaking (). It is not spoken out of fear of spirits, but to prevent the nuts from being watery, tough, or rotten; or in the case for cassowaries, to show respect to the bird. Kalam pandanus language may also be used outside the forest without penalty unlike other versions. This register is possibly thousands of years old, and may be inspired by older pandanus languages. The Huli language has an avoidance register called () used for collecting Pandanus as well as hunting or traveling. , like many of the above, is used to evade malevolent bush spirits.

Her studies there were largely self directed as she found no contemporary sculpture of interest to her in Australia.leftWhile still a student, she was invited to be a member of the Victorian Sculptors' Society (VSS), where she exhibited, and was later Vice President. In 1953 she was a founding member of the 'Group of Four' with Inge King, Julius Kane and Clifford Last.

In 1958 she returned to Australia to take up a teaching post at the Swinburne Technical College, and became a founding member of the renowned 'Centre Five' group of sculptors in 1959, a group which expanded from the 'Group of Four' to add (among others) Lenton Parr, Vincas Jomantas and Teisutis Zikaras, who broke with the VSS and organised private exhibitions.

(formerly WobbleWorks LLC). The 3Doodler works by extruding heated plastic that cools almost instantly into a solid, stable structure, allowing for the free-hand creation of three-dimensional objects. It utilizes plastic thread made of either acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (\\"ABS\\"), polylactic acid (\\"PLA\\"), or “FLEXY”, thermal polyurethane (“TPU”) that is melted and then cooled through a patented process while moving through the pen, which can then be used to make 3D objects by hand. The 3Doodler has been described as a glue gun for 3D printing because of how the plastic is extruded from the tip, with one foot of the plastic thread equaling \\"about 11 feet of extruded material\\". There are three models of the pen, Start, Create and Pro, intended for children, general consumers, and professionals respectively. Origins The inventors of the 3Doodler (Maxwell Bogue and Peter Dilworth) built the first 3Doodler prototype in early 2012 at the Artisan's Asylum in Somerville, Massachusetts. After waiting fourteen hours for a 3D print job to complete, they discovered that the printer had missed a line. So they decided, \\"Why not keep it the way it is and make it a pen?\\" Kickstarter campaign WobbleWorks launched a Kickstarter campaign for the 3Doodler on February 19, 2013 with an initial fundraising target of $30,000. The campaign closed on 25 March 2013. The $50 reward level was the minimum needed to receive the product, with highly recommended reward levels of $75 and $99 including more bags of plastic thread, and the highest level of $10,000 including a \\"membership in the company’s beta testing program for future products\\" and the opportunity to spend an entire day with the company's founders, along with the backer's 3Doodler being personally engraved. The reward levels were expanded due to demand, with the added tiers of the product shipping in 2014 rather than in 2013 for the earlier backers. The company also teamed up with several Etsy wire-artists to showcase the abilities of the 3Doodler and to create \\"limited edition art pieces\\" for the campaign. The fundraising target was reached within a matter of hours and many of the reward levels were sold out within the first day, along with all the Etsy art pieces. By February 22, more than $1 million had been pledged, and the final pledge amount exceeded $2 million.  3Doodler Start  3Doodler Start Pen 3Doodler Start is a special design of 3Doodler, especially designed for little children. The developer states that it is kid-safe, for the tip of the pen does not heat up. Instead of plugging it in a cable to a power outlet like other 3Doodlers, one can charge it and then press the on button to use the pen. 3Doodler 2.0 In January 2015, an improved version of the 3Doodler was introduced, and a second fundraising campaign on Kickstarter yielded more than $1.5 million. Updates include an option for changing the size and shape of the tip, a smaller design, and a quieter fan. 3Doodler EDU 3Doodler EDU sets are designed to be used in schools by educators and students. The target age group for 3Doodler EDU is from K-12 to University and the pens can be used to add an element of creativity and arts into STEM/STEAM education. 3Doodler EDU has been certified for pedagogical quality by Education Alliance Finland.

More recently it has been used to describe the introduction of secular uses in under-used places of worship, while retaining their primary purpose as places of worship.Re-ordering Church Interiors (leaflet), Committee on Church Art and Architecture, Church of Scotland, 2003 (updated August 2008).DAC Guidance Notes: Re-ordering, Diocese of Birmingham (undated) Twenty-first century church church re-ordering involves the transformation of under-used places of worship by the introduction of secular uses, while retaining their primary purpose as places of worship. use the term to describe the latter. History Church conversions, where large under-used religious buildings have been transformed into other uses, are nothing new. The impressive Lincoln College Library in Oxford (formerly the city's baroque church of All Saints), the spacious OAP's Day Centre contained within the shell of York's Church of St Sampson, and the world-famous music performance space at St John's, Smith Square in Westminster, are all English exemplars which pre-date the reordering movement. In 1977, London's Victoria and Albert Museum mounted a major exhibition entitled 'Change or Decay', curated by its then Director Sir Roy Strong. Its central theme was that Britain had too many places of worship and that, because of their architectural significance, many needed to be saved from closure and demolition. An accompanying book, by Marcus Binney (co-founder of the conservation pressure group Save Britain's Heritage) and the architect Peter Burnham, illustrated the plight of many of these threatened church buildings, in an era when attrition was severe. Between 1970 and 2004 the CofE closed 1,630 of its churches; some 85 of these, which were listed buildings, were subsequently demolished. The national attendance records maintained by the Church of England (CofE) show that fewer than 2% of the population are regular churchgoers. Church reordering advocates believe that broader community-based uses of under-used churches could turn the tide. Though the technique of church reordering has been embraced by many faiths, it is the Anglican Communion which leads the way. In England, there are just over 16,000 'active' church buildings, with 14,500 of them owned by the CofE, which as of 2013 spends £100 million annually on their maintenance. Some 12,000 of these churches are 'listed' by English Heritage as being of architectural significance, with around 4,000 now classified as being Grade I (the highest category). Selexyz bookstore in Maastricht; a conversion from a 13th-century Dominican church Other European countries have tackled the problem of what to do with their unwanted places of worship rather more radically. In the Dutch town of Arnhem, the former church of St Joseph is now an indoor skatepark, while in Maastricht the city's 13th century Dominican Church has been converted (by the Amsterdam-based architects Merckx + Girod) into the award- winning Selexyz bookstore. Deconsecration - where a church building's religious use is officially removed - is a drastic step which many faiths are reluctant to take. In the five years 2007-12, 123 CofE church buildings were deconsecrated and put to other uses, residential being the largest (22%). A further 29 were demolished and six were transferred to the Churches Conservation Trust (CCT) for repair and preservation. Founded in 1968, the CCT currently cares for 341 English churches. Its reordering schemes range from the cultural centre in the King's Lynn, Norfolk church of St Nicholas, to Circomedia's award-winning training school for aspiring circus trapeze artists in the Bristol church of St Paul's. In general, the Roman Catholic hierarchy is opposed to 'mixed-use' conversions, preferring to see its under-used consecrated buildings closed rather than becoming involved with non-worship activities. Nevertheless, several churches in Quebec have moved to mixed uses. Montreal's Church of the Gesù, while still an active church, is best known as a cultural centre and concert hall, while in rural Quebec, several churches have been partially repurposed, for example by converting the nave into community space but preserving the chancel behind a movable wall which can be opened for services. Richard Giles' Re-pitching the tent is now widely regarded as the definitive guide to reordering, while the American historian Katherine French's study of community life in medieval England (The People of the Parish) reveals that activities other than conventional worship would frequently be encountered in many town churches. People might met to trade, complete business deals or consult lawyers. Scriveners were usually on hand, on the lookout for work. It is a return to this medieval concept of the church being 'community-based' which is at the heart of the reordering movement. In Britain, national awards schemes and conferences have helped to promote the reordering movement. In 2008, the City of London's Mercers Livery Company launched its 'Village Church for Village Life' award, with a first prize of £10,000. The winner was the parish church of St Phillip & St James at Newton St Philip in Somerset. In October 2012, at Lambeth Palace (the London residence of the CofE's Leader, the Archbishop of Canterbury), a national conference entitled 'New work in churches' also focussed on church reordering. Examples All Saints Church, Hereford One of the most successful church reordering schemes in England is the award-winning conversion of All Saints in the West Midlands cathedral city of Hereford, completed in 1999 and designed by local architect Rod Robinson. All Saints is the oldest parish church in Hereford (parts of its interior date back to the late-12th century), yet in 1991 it came perilously close to being closed and deconsecrated. The solution to the dwindling congregations and spiralling maintenance costs was to 'insert' a café at the west end of the nave, linked to a new mezzanine eating area 'suspended' above the south arcade, and to sacrifice the church's South Chapel, which is now available for commercial lettings such as arts and crafts exhibitions. Both the central nave and chancel, as well as the Lady Chapel, are retained as areas of worship. A new vestry, formed from curved sheets of frosted glass, completes the transformation. An indication of the success of this radical reordering scheme, which cost £1.7M, is that around 2,000 people pass through Café @ All Saints every week, and church worship attendances have quadrupled. The Diocese of Hereford has played a leading role in propagating the ideas of church reordering right across Herefordshire, where 90% of the county's 425 churches are listed. A dedicated team within the Diocese Office has overseen or advised on 40 church reordering exercises, several of which have won national architectural awards. Among these are a community centre (shared by five neighbouring parishes) in the 12th-century church of St Andrew's at Bridge Sollers and St Peter's at Peterchurch, where a village lending library, a children's play area and a space for music recitals have all been seamlessly woven into the fabric of this little Norman church. The latter project won the prestigious national ACE/RIBA design award in 2012. Both conversions are the work of the Herefordshire practice Communion Design. Further reading *Davies J.D.

He joined the army of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1782 and fought in one of the early battles of the French Revolutionary Wars. He led a Grenz Infantry Regiment before being promoted to general officer in 1807. He led a brigade at Eckmühl in 1809, a division in the summer of 1813, and a corps at Caldiero in 1813 and at the Mincio in 1814. During the 1815 Italian campaign, he led a corps in Switzerland, Piedmont, and France. After the wars, he commanded part of the Military Frontier. He was Proprietor (Inhaber) of an infantry regiment from 1815 until his death in 1829. Birth to 1809 Radivojevich was born into a family of Serbian descent in Szentendre near Budapest in the Kingdom of Hungary, which was part of the Habsburg Monarchy at the time. In 1782, he joined the Austrian army as an officer cadet in the Peterwardeiner Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 9. He fought against the French at the First Battle of Wissembourg in 1793. He became Oberst (colonel) of the Broder Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 7 and served with distinction during the War of the Third Coalition in 1805. The Broder Regiment fought at the Battle of Dürrenstein on 11 November 1805 and at the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December. Promoted General-major on 2 April 1807, he found himself commanding a brigade in Hannibal Sommariva's division of Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg's IV Corps in the War of the Fifth Coalition. At the Battle of Eckmühl on 22 April 1809 he led his troops which included two battalions of the Walachisch-Illyrian Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 13, eight squadrons of the Stipsicz Hussar Regiment Nr. 10, and a six gun cavalry battery with 6-pound guns. He led troops under the overall command of Michael von Kienmayer in an Austrian victory at the Battle of Gefrees on 8 July 1809. 1809 to 1814 Radivojevich was promoted to Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 25 August 1809. From 1810 to 1811 he was acting commander of the Banat district of the Military Frontier. He became the Second Inhaber of Infantry Regiment Nr. 14 in 1811. During 1812 he directed the Observation Corps in Transylvania. In August 1813, he commanded a division in Johann von Hiller's Army of Inner Austria. Radivojevich directed three brigades under Ignaz Csivich von Rohr, Matthias Rebrovich, and Laval Nugent von Westmeath. Csivich led one battalion each of the Archduke Franz Karl Infantry Regiment Nr. 52, Warasdeiner-Kreutzer Grenz Nr. 5 and St. Georger Grenz Nr. 6. Rebrovich supervised one battalion of the Gradiscaner Grenz Nr. 8 and two battalions of the Archduke Franz Karl Nr. 52. Nugent led four squadrons of the Radetzky Hussar Regiment Nr. 5. Johann von Hiller Radivojevich's 10,000 troops were ordered to invade the Illyrian Provinces in the south while Hiller attacked in the north. Radivojevich brought 12,000 muskets with his columns to arm the Croats who were irritated with the French occupation. As his columns advanced in mid-August 1813, the Croat and Serb population rose in revolt, facilitating the success of the Austrian army. His troops quickly captured Karlovac (Karlstadt) and Novo Mesto (Neustadt). While Hiller suffered defeats at Villach in late August and in the Battle of Feistritz on 6 September, Radivojevich's columns scored a series of successes. Nugent's task force drubbed an Italian force at Lipa on 7 September 1813. Though Nugent sustained a minor setback at Jelšane on 14 September, Rebrovich won an engagement with an Italian force at Višnja Gora on the 16th. At Cerknica on 27 September 1813, Radivojevich himself led 4,000 Austrians and nine guns in a victory over the 5,000 men and seven guns of Giuseppe Federico Palombini's 5th Italian Division. Csivich's brigade was engaged, as was Rebrovich's Gradiscaner Grenz Nr. 8 battalion and Nugent's hussars. Palombini's force included nine Italian battalions and two Illyrian battalions. Casualties are unknown except that 300 Italians were captured. By 5 October, the Franco-Italian army of Eugène de Beauharnais abandoned Illyria and fell back to the Isonzo River. Heinrich von Bellegarde On October 1813, Radivojevich was appointed commander of the Left Wing Corps, which he would lead until the end of the 1814 campaign. The advance guard of his corps reached Gradisca on 6 October 1813. After hearing that the Kingdom of Bavaria defected to the Coalition on 8 October, Eugène began retreating to the Adige River on the 16th. Hoping to cut Eugène off from Verona, Hiller ordered Radivojevich to apply frontal pressure on the Franco-Italians while he sent three brigades to turn Eugène's left flank in the Tyrol. Rebrovich's advance guard of the Left Wing Corps crossed the Isonzo on 24 October and scouted in the direction of Palmanova which was garrisoned by 4,000 Franco-Italians. At first Rebrovich pushed hard on Eugène's rear guards, but later slackened his pace when Radivojevich was instructed to distract Eugène while avoiding a major battle. At the Battle of Bassano on 31 October, the Franco-Italians pushed one of Hiller's flanking columns out of the way. Covered by effective rear guard actions against Radivojevich's oncoming columns, Eugène's army got safely back to the Adige in the first week of November. Because Radivojevich was forced to detach troops to mask the fortresses of Venice, Palmanova, and Osoppo, his weakened corps was unable to seriously threaten the Adige line. Even so, historian Frederick C. Schneid considered Radivojevich's movements \\"lethargic\\". Meanwhile, Trieste surrendered to Nugent on 28 October after a 16-day siege. When Hiller probed the Adige line near Verona, Eugène reacted by launching a counterattack. At 10:00 AM on 15 November, several Franco-Italian divisions assaulted the Austrian positions in the Battle of Caldiero. The Austrians were worsted, losing 1,500 killed and wounded plus 900 men and two cannons captured. The Franco-Italians lost only 500 killed and wounded out of a total of 16,000. Radivojevich was in tactical control of 8,000 soldiers in 10 battalions, 11 squadrons, and nine artillery pieces. In the action, he directed one division led by Franz Mauroy de Merville and three brigades under Anton Gundaker von Starhemberg, Ludwig von Eckhardt, and August von Vécsey.Smith 1998, gives Austrian killed and wounded as 500 . Unhappy with Hiller's inability to chase Eugène out of Italy, the Hofkriegsrat replaced him with Count Heinrich von Bellegarde. When Joachim Murat defected to the Coalition in January 1814, bringing the army of the Kingdom of Naples with him, Eugène abandoned the line of the Adige and fell back to the Mincio River. Hoping to secure a bridgehead across the Mincio, Bellegarde put his army in motion. On the same day, Eugène determined to drive back the Austrian outposts. These actions brought about the Battle of the Mincio River on 8 February 1814. The Franco-Italians won the battle while losing 3,000 killed and wounded and 500 captured out of 34,000 troops engaged. The Austrians suffered losses of 2,800 killed and wounded plus 1,200 men captured. Accompanied by Bellegarde, Radivojevich's right wing got across the Mincio at Borghetto near Valeggio and began to drive back Eugène's weak left wing under Jean-Antoine Verdier. Meanwhile, Eugène made his main effort on the right with Paul Grenier's reinforced corps. He and Grenier crossed the river and began rolling up the Austrian left wing after heavy fighting near Pozzolo. Though outnumbered three-to-one, Verdier's men proved unexpectedly tenacious and held out most of the day. When Eugène and Grenier approached Valeggio from the south, threatening to cut them off from the east bank, Bellegarde and Radivojevich hastily withdrew their soldiers and conceded defeat. Undaunted, they tried to force a crossing two days later, but were repulsed again. Discouraged, Bellegarde never again tried to break the Mincio line during the campaign. 1815 and later Johann Frimont During the Hundred Days when Napoleon returned from exile, Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet was appointed to defend the border of France from Switzerland to the Mediterranean Sea. The Corps of Observation of the Alps counted 23,000 infantry, 900 cavalry, and 28 cannons. Of these, only 8,600 infantry were regulars while the remainder were from the National Guard. The Austrian army in Piedmont numbered 48,000 mostly veteran troops under Johann Maria Philipp Frimont. His I Corps was led by Radivojevich, while Ferdinand, Graf Bubna von Littitz directed the II Corps and Merville commanded the Reserve. In addition, there were 12,000 rather shaky Piedmontese soldiers. The I Corps consisted of the Light Division under Louis Charles Folliot de Crenneville and the 1st Division with no commander but with two brigades under Joseph von Fölseis and Philipp Pflüger von Lindenfels. Crenneville led three Grenz infantry and two Jäger battalions, eight squadrons of Chevau-légers, and a light battery. The other two brigades each had one artillery battery and six battalions split evenly between two line infantry regiments. Frimont sent Bubna and the Piedmontese army west through the Mount Cenis Pass confront Suchet. Meanwhile, he and Radivojevich moved north through the Simplon Pass into Switzerland with the purpose of reaching Geneva and turning the French northern flank. Intent on seizing the mountain passes, Suchet moved into Savoy on 14 June 1815. After capturing or chasing away the 3,000 Piedmontese defenders, the French began to encounter Austrian troops. Soon Austrian numerical superiority made itself felt. Both Radivojevich and Bubna were pressing back the French when news of Napoleon's abdication arrived to end the fighting. After negotiating an armistice, Suchet's forces withdrew from Savoy. But the Austrians kept advancing, taking both Grenoble and Lyon before the war officially ended. After the fighting ended, Radivojevich took command of the Reserve Corps of the Army of Italy from July until October 1815, when he was briefly the acting army commander. He was appointed Inhaber of the Radivojevich Infantry Regiment Nr. 48 in November 1815. A court-martial convicted the previous Inhaber Joseph Anton von Simbschen of abuse of office on 12 July 1815. The Hofkriegsrat then overturned the mild verdict, sentenced Simbschen to a harsher penalty, and stripped him of the title of Inhaber. Radivojevich received a Russian medal, the Order of St. Anna 1st Class in 1815 and a Piedmontese award, the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus at an unknown date. He became an Imperial Privy Councillor on 2 December 1816. He was appointed to command the Warasdin-Karlstadt district of the Military Frontier in February 1823. He received the noble rank of Freiherr on 13 April 1826. On 18 February 1829, the old veteran assumed the rank of Feldzeugmeister. He was deputy commander of Lombardy-Venetia from March 1829 until his death on 15 July 1829 at Verona. Alois Gollner von Goldenfels became the new Inhaber of Infantry Regiment Nr. 48.

Plot  The episode opens with Barney sitting in despair on the sidewalk, as Future Ted tells the story of the night his life fell apart. Six hours earlier, Robin asked Barney to deliver a $5,000 deposit to the wedding caterer and join her in a dinner with his mother Loretta. Ted and Marshall \\"abduct\\" Barney for a surprise bachelor party. Barney calls Robin to tell her he will not be making it to dinner and Loretta is already there so it is too late to cancel much to Robin's dismay. Reaching a cheap hotel in Atlantic City, Ted and Marshall explain that they remember what Barney requested for his bachelor party (which he has dubbed the 'Bro Mitzvah') from when he was engaged to Quinn. However, they manage to get everything wrong and end up bringing a DVD of An Inconvenient Truth (for Barney's requirement of 'Fear for our Lives') and a clown who does balloon animals (for 'Mind-blowing Entertainment'). They also invite Ralph Macchio for when Barney stated he wanted to meet the hero of The Karate Kid, only to be reminded that he considers Johnny Lawrence as the hero of the film. Lily starts flirting with Macchio and Barney refuses to get along with him despite expressing the same behavior. Barney is stunned to learn that the stripper hired is actually Quinn, who claims to have been despondent after they broke up and is furious that Barney is engaged again. She agrees to put on a show for everyone except Barney, who is forced to sit in the hotel bathroom taking angry calls from Robin, who is having a terrible time with Loretta. Afterwards, he decides to call it a night and join Robin, but on the ride back with Ted, Marshall, Lily, Quinn, Ralph and the clown, he is reminded of the many casinos in the city and turns back where he quickly gambles away the $5,000. In an attempt to recoup his losses, he gambles away Marshall as collateral for $80,000. Heading home, he admits to everyone what he did and Ted angrily ends his friendship with him. He runs into a furious Robin who, upon seeing Quinn and realizing she was the stripper, breaks up with him. As a devastated Barney collapses onto the sidewalk (as per the opening scene), Robin gets out-of-sight and calls Ted to tell him everything is on schedule, revealing the entire evening to be a hoax. Three weeks earlier, the gang brainstormed for ideas but when Marshall notes they will never be able to give a guy like Barney the best night of his life, Robin, whom as his fiancée Barney dismissed as incapable of organizing bachelor parties, proposes giving him the worst. Having arranged everything with Quinn, Loretta, Ralph and the casino bosses, the entire evening has been a perfect set-up to make Barney think his life was ruined. Back on the sidewalk, the casino mobsters arrive and seemingly cut off Marshall's hand before dragging Barney inside. When he reaches his apartment, he finds everyone waiting for him. When they come clean about the plan, Barney is amazed at its complexity, and even more so when he learns that Robin planned it all. The plan appears to satisfy all his requests for a \\"Bro Mitzvah\\", except for including the hero of The Karate Kid. However, Barney gets the biggest surprise when the clown reveals he is actually William Zabka, wearing a Cobra Kai uniform underneath his clown costume. Barney hugs his hero in happiness. Critical reception Entertainment Weeklys Sandra Gonzalez gave the episode a positive review, and wrote that it \\"was one of (her) favorite just-for-fun surprises they’ve delivered in years\\". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ stating that while this is one of the show's better entries, what stopped it from being truly great was that the evening felt like a ruse right from the beginning. Angel Cohn of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B−, praising the episode for giving Robin the chance to show her deviousness, the performance by Ralph Macchio and having the entire cast involved in the main plot. Max Nicholson of IGN scored the episode 7.8, stating that while he enjoyed the majority of the episode (in particular, the final twist regarding the clown's identity), it suffered from the Robin/Loretta dinner scenes (stating that they felt hammy and were unnecessary, especially considering they never really happened) and the flirting between Lily and Ralph.

It was a marine invertebrate found on the seabed in shallow seas. It probably evolved during the Devonian period and it is believed to be the largest brachiopod that has ever existed. Description Gigantoproductus giganteus was a large brachiopod that superficially resembled a cockle. Fossils of this species have been found with widths of over . It had a pair of thick dome-shaped valves joined together by a hinge. The valves had a small number of broad ribs that radiated from a thick umbo and there were large wing-shaped ears of calcareous material on either side. The valves were held together by a central strong adductor muscle which left a scar on the inside of the valves. The ventral valve, also known as the pedicle, was covered with spines on the outside. The inside of this valve was rough, being covered by numerous cone-shaped protrusions. These are visible in an internal mould of the brachiopod, a cast fossil which has been formed when a hole in sediment left by the soft tissues of the dead organism was later infiltrated by mineral matter. Distribution and habitat The fossil record suggests that Gigantoproductus giganteus was common between about 345 and 328 million years ago. Fossils have been found in Europe, Asia and North Africa. The morphology of the shell makes it likely that it lived on the seabed, partially buried in sand or mud, in shallow water in locations with strong waves and currents. Here its large size, its heavy weight, its ears and spines would have helped provide stability, preventing it from rolling around. Biology Like other brachiopods, Gigantoproductus giganteus was a filter feeder, using its lophophore, a specialist feeding organ, to extract planktonic particles from the water. Reproduction was likely to have involved release of gametes into the water column. Gigantoproductus giganteus, like the vast majority of other brachiopod species, may have become extinct after a catastrophic event known as the Permian–Triassic extinction event which occurred about 252 million years ago.

Noble, America by Design: Science, Technology, and the Rise of Corporate Capitalism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977), pp. 106-107. A strong supporter of patent reform, he worked for ways of streamlining and expediting patent operations. He often complained about the case backlogs, cramped offices and low salaries of the examiners and other members of the U.S. Patent Office.“New Building for Patent Office Will Be Urged”, The Washington Herald, Sunday, 7 September 1913, p. 2, col. 1-7.Thomas Ewing [III], “The Inventor and the Patent Office”, The Independent [Weekly Magazine], Vol. 77, No. 3408 (30 March 1914), pp. 449-450.“Inadequate Appropriations Handicap Patent Office”, Electrical World, Vol. 69, no. 7 (17 February 1917), pp. 330-331.

He still ran into more problems when World War I began. Many of the workers left the Patent Corps to go \\"Over There\\" to France with the Army and Navy Corps. The war also complicated the conditions for the patent applications on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, forcing Ewing to declare that the United States would not take over the patents from the citizens of enemy nations.“Status of Patents Unchanged”, The Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Vol. 9, No. 5 (May 1917), p. 531 But he drew criticism,“Patents During the War”, The American Stationer and Office Outfitter, Vol. LXXXI, No. 22 (2 June 1917), p. 21 and this situation would not be resolved until 1921, when the Nolan Bill was passed by the Congress. Nevertheless, in spite of the difficulties, under Ewing's administration, two agencies were created. One of them was the Patent Office Society, formed in 1917 \\"to promote and foster a true appreciation of the American Patent System\\". The other was the National Research Council (NRC), organized in 1916 to oversee the scientific and technical services for the war effort. The NRC was asked by Ewing to assemble a committee specifically to prepare the legislation to reform the patent laws. It eventually succeeded in having the Lampert Patent Office Bill passed by the Congress – in 1922, five years after the end of Ewing's term. Ewing was notable for another reason. He consistently ignored President Wilson's policies of discrimination against blacks in the U.S. Civil Service.August Meier and Elliott M. Rudwick, Along the Color Line: Explorations in the Black Experience (Champaign, Illinois: The University of Illinois Press, 2002), p. 160. Before he was appointed as the Commissioner, he had been the first Chairman of the Legal Committee for a year since 1911, when it was established by the NAACP.Meier and Rudwick, Along the Color Line, p. 129.

This board encouraged the munitions and aircraft industries to pool their patents to help the technological development for the war effort. When the war was over, Ewing returned to Yonkers and resumed his law practice. But he continued to lecture on patent law at Georgetown University. He had begun in 1914\\"Commissioner Ewing to Lecture\\", The Evening Star (Washington, D.C., USA), Saturday, 7 November 1914, p. 21, col. 7. and he would continue until 1932.\\"Thomas Ewing Dies at 80: Former Federal Patent Commissioner\\", The Boston Herald (Boston, Massachusetts, USA), Tuesday, 8 December 1942, p. 23, col. 4.

Activities  Like his father, Thomas was a Democrat. He ran for the Mayor of Yonkers as the Democratic candidate twice, in 1897 and 1899, but he lost each time. However, he did join the Yonkers School Board in 1897 and stayed until 1903. Then he switched to the Yonkers Police Board for two more years, from 1905 to 1907.

He was instrumental in the 13th century CE, in keeping control over most of Afghanistan where a permanent garrison of Mongol troops was quartered in the Kunduz-Baghlan area, and in 1253 fell under the jurisdiction of Sali Noyan. In 1252-3 Sali Noyan of the Tatar clan was sent to the Indian borderlands at the head of fresh troops, and was given authority over the Mongols later known as Qara'unas. Sali himself was subordinate to Möngke's brother Hulagu Khan. The Kashmiris were conquered in 1235 by the Mongols but they revolted in 1254–1255, and Möngke Khan, who became Great Khan in 1251, appointed his generals, Sali and Takudar, to replace the court appointed Buddhist master, Otochi, as darugachi of Kashmir. However, the Kashmiri king killed Otochi at Srinagar. Sali invaded Kashmir, killing the king, and put down the rebellion, after which the country remained subject to the Mongol Empire for many years. Due to the internal conflicts of the Delhi Sultanate, the Mamluk Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud's brother, Jalal al-Din Masud, fled into Mongol territory traveled to the Mongol capital at Karakorum in 1248. When Möngke was crowned as Khagan, Jalal al-Din Masud attended the ceremony and asked help from Möngke. Möngke ordered Sali to assist him to recover his ancestral realm. Sali made successive attacks on Multan and Lahore. Shamsuddin Muhammad bin Abu Bakr, the client Malik of Herat, accompanied the Mongols. Jalal al-Din was installed as client ruler of Lahore, Kujah and Sodra. In 1257 the governor of Sindh offered his entire province to Hulagu Khan, Mongke's brother, and sought Mongol protection from his overlord in Delhi. Hulagu led a strong force under Sali into Sindh. In the winter of 1257 – beginning of 1258, Sali Noyan entered Sindh in strength and dismantled the fortifications of Multan; his forces may also have invested the island fortress of Bukkur on the Indus. The Mongol Empire during the reign of Mongke Khan (r.1251-59) But Hulagu refused to sanction a grand invasion of the Delhi Sultanate and a few years later diplomatic correspondence between the two rulers confirmed the growing desire for peace. Hulagu had many other areas of conquests to take care of in Syria and southwestern Asia. Large-scale Mongol invasions of India ceased and the Delhi Sultans used the respite to recover the frontier towns like Multan, Uch, and Lahore, and to punish the local Ranas and Rais who had joined hands with either the Khwarazim or the Mongol invaders. Sali Noyan's position was later inherited by his son Uladu Noyan, and grandson Baktut Noyan. These Turco- Mongol garrison troops (tamma) formed the Qara'unas faction, and by the 14th Century had allied with the Chaghataite Khanate. Under the rule of Temür the Qara'unas were given to Chekü Barlas, and then to his son Jahānshāh. Forbes Manz notes that these Kunduz-Baghlan forces appear to have remained cohesive and influential throughout the Timurid period, though under different leaders and different names, up until the Uzbek invasion. By the Islamic year 900 (1494–1495 CE), the area was noted in the Baburnama as ruled by a Qipchaq emir.

These semantic units cannot be understood based upon the meanings of the individual parts alone, but must be taken as a whole. In other words, the meaning is non- compositional and thus unpredictable.That unpredictability of meaning is the defining trait of phrasal verb constructions is widely assumed. See for instance Huddleston and Pullum (2002:273) and Allerton (2006:166). Phrasal verbs that include a preposition are known as prepositional verbs and phrasal verbs that include a particle are also known as particle verbs. Additional alternative terms for phrasal verb are compound verb, verb-adverb combination, verb-particle construction, two-part word/verb or three-part word/verb (depending on the number of particles) and multi-word verb.Concerning these terms, see McArthur (1992:72ff.). Phrasal verbs are differentiated from other classifications of multi-word verbs and free combinations by criteria based on idiomaticity, replacement by a single-word verb, wh-question formation and particle movement.  Examples  There are at least three main types of phrasal verb constructions depending on whether the verb combines with a preposition, a particle, or both.Declerck, R. Comprehensive Descriptive Grammar of English, A – 1991 Page 45 \\"The term multi-word verb can be used as a cover term for phrasal verbs, prepositional verbs, prepositional phrasal verbs and combinations like put an end to.\\" The phrasal verb constructions in the following examples are in bold. :: _Verb + preposition (prepositional verbs)_ The Collins Cobuild English Grammar (1995:162) is a source that takes prepositional verbs to be phrasal verbs. Many other grammars, in contrast, distinguish between prepositional verbs (the additional word is a preposition) and phrasal verbs (the additional word is a particle). ::When the element is a preposition, it is the head of a full prepositional phrase and the phrasal verb is thus prepositional. These phrasal verbs can also be thought of as transitive and non-separable; the complement follows the phrasal verb. ::a. Who is looking after the kids? – after is a preposition that introduces the prepositional phrase after the kids. ::b. They picked on nobody. – on is a preposition that introduces the prepositional phrase on nobody. ::c. I ran into an old friend. – into is a preposition that introduces the prepositional phrase into an old friend.Ron Cowan – The Teacher's Grammar of English: A Course Book and Reference 2008 Page 176 \\"The Adverb Insertion Test – Earlier, we saw that intransitive phrasal verbs usually do not permit the insertion of an adverb between the verb and the particle, and the same is true of transitive phrasal verbs, as (25a) and (25b) show. In contrast, prepositional verbs do permit adverb insertion, as (25c) demonstrates. (25) a. He turned quickly out the light. = separable phrasal verb. b. He ran unexpectedly into his cousin = inseparable phrasal verb. c. He stared intently at the target = prepositional verb. The Relative Clause Test Relative clauses in which the relative pronoun is the object of a preposition permit the two patterns shown in (26). (26) a. The man [that they were waiting for] was late b. The man [ for whom they were waiting] was late. In (26a), the preposition for is at the end of the relative clause enclosed by square brackets, but (26b) shows that this preposition can also occur at the beginning of the clause before the relative pronoun whom.\\" ::d. She takes after her mother. – after is a preposition that introduces the prepositional phrase after her mother. ::e. Sam passes for a linguist. – for is a preposition that introduces the prepositional phrase for a linguist. ::f. You should stand by your friend. – by is a preposition that introduces the prepositional phrase by your friend :: _Verb + particle (particle verbs)_ ::When the element is a particle, it cannot (or no longer) be construed as a preposition, but rather is a particle because it does not take a complement.For a list of the particles that occur with particle phrasal verbs, see Jurafsky and Martin (2000:319). These verbs can be transitive or intransitive. If they are transitive, they are separable. ::a. They brought that up twice. – up is a particle, not a preposition. ::b. You should think it over. – over is a particle, not a preposition. ::c. Why does he always dress down? – down is a particle, not a preposition. ::d. You should not give in so quickly. – in is a particle, not a preposition. ::e. Where do they want to hang out? – out is a particle, not a preposition. ::f. She handed it in. – in is a particle, not a preposition. :: _Verb + particle + preposition (particle- prepositional verbs)_ ::Many phrasal verbs combine a particle and a preposition. Just as for prepositional verbs, particle-prepositional verbs are not separable. ::a. Who can put up with that? – up is a particle and with is a preposition.Jeanette S. DeCarrico The structure of English: studies in form and function – Volume 1 – Page 80 – 2000 \\"4.6.3 Prepositional Phrasal Verbs – It is also possible to find phrasal verbs that are themselves followed by a preposition. These structures are called prepositional phrasal verbs or multiword verbs. Examples are put up with (e.g., I can't put up with) \\" ::b. She is looking forward to a rest. – forward is a particle and to is a preposition. ::c. The other tanks were bearing down on my Panther. – down is a particle and on is a preposition. ::d. They were really teeing off on me. – off is a particle and on is a preposition. ::e. We loaded up on snacks. – up is a particle and on is a preposition ::f. Susan has been sitting in for me. – in is a particle and for is a preposition. The aspect of these types of verbs that unifies them under the single banner phrasal verb is the fact that their meaning cannot be understood based upon the meaning of their parts taken in isolation: the meaning of pick up is distinct from pick; the meaning of hang out is not obviously related to hang. Distinguishing phrasal verb types When a particle verb is transitive, it can look just like a prepositional verb. This similarity is source of confusion, since it obscures the difference between prepositional and particle verbs. A simple diagnostic distinguishes between the two, however. When the object of a particle verb is a definite pronoun, it can and usually does precede the particle.For an example of the shifting diagnostic used to distinguish particle verbs from prepositional verbs, see Tallerman (1998:129). In contrast, the object of a preposition can never precede the preposition.Concerning the difference between particles and prepositions with phrasal verbs, see Jurafsky and Martin (2000:318). ::a. You can bank on Susan. – on is a preposition. ::b. *You can bank Susan on. – The object of the preposition cannot precede the preposition. ::a. You can take on Susan. – on is a particle. ::b. You can take Susan on. – The object of the particle verb can precede the particle. ::a. He is getting over the situation. – over is a preposition. ::b. *He is getting the situation over. – The object of the preposition cannot precede the preposition in the phrasal verb. ::a. He is thinking over the situation. – over is a particle. ::b. He is thinking the situation over. – The object of the particle verb can precede the particle Thus the distinction between particles and prepositions is made by function, because the same word can function sometimes as a particle and sometimes as a preposition. Some notes on terminology The terminology of phrasal verbs is inconsistent. Modern theories of syntax tend to use the term phrasal verb to denote particle verbs only; they do not view prepositional verbs as phrasal verbs.For examples of accounts that use the term phrasal verb to denote particle verbs only (not prepositional verbs), see for instance Tallerman (1998:130), Adger (2003:99f.) and Haiden (2006). In contrast, literature in English as a second or foreign language ESL/EFL, tends to employ the term phrasal verb to encompass both prepositional and particle verbs.For example, the series 'English File' uses phrasal verbs in this way. This exercise on the English File website features both types of verbs under the term \\"phrasal verbs\\". elt.oup.com Note that prepositions and adverbs can have a literal meaning that is spatial or orientational. Many English verbs interact with a preposition or an adverb to yield a meaning that can be readily understood from the constituent elements. ::He walked across the square. ::She opened the shutters and looked outside. These more readily understandable combinations are not phrasal verbs, although EFL/ESL books and dictionaries may include them in lists of phrasal verbs. Furthermore, the same words that occur as a genuine phrasal verb can also appear in other contexts, as in ::1(a) She looked up his address. Phrasal verb. ::1(b) She looked his address up. Phrasal verb. ::2(a) When he heard the crash, he looked up. Not a phrasal verb. ::2(b) When he heard the crash, he looked up at the sky. Not a phrasal verb. The terminology used to denote the particle is also inconsistent. Sometimes it is called an adverb and at other times an intransitive prepositional phrase.Huddleston and Pullum (2002:273), for instance, also use intransitive preposition to describe a particle. The inconsistent use of terminology in these areas is a source of confusion over what qualifies as a phrasal verb and the status of the particle or a preposition. Concerning the history of the term phrasal verb, Tom McArthur writes: ::\\"...the term phrasal verb was first used by Logan Pearsall Smith, in Words and Idioms (1925), in which he states that the OED Editor Henry Bradley suggested the term to him.\\" The value of this choice and its alternatives (including separable verb for Germanic languages) is debatable. In origin the concept is based on translation linguistics; as many single-word English and Latinate words are translatable by a phrasal verb complex in English, therefore the logic is that the phrasal verb complex must be a complete semantic unit in itself. One should consider in this regard that the actual term phrasal verb suggests that such constructions should form phrases. In most cases however, they clearly do not form phrases. Hence the very term phrasal verb is misleading and a source of confusion, which has motivated some to reject the term outright.Huddleston and Pullum (2002:274) reject the term phrasal verb because the relevant word combinations often do not form phrases. Catenae The aspect of phrasal verb constructions that makes them difficult to learn for non-native speakers of English is that their meaning is non-compositional. That is, one cannot know what a given phrasal verb construction means based upon what the verb alone and/or the preposition and/or particle alone mean, as emphasized above. This trait of phrasal verbs is also what makes them interesting for linguists, since they appear to defy the principle of compositionality. An analysis of phrasal verbs in terms of catenae (=chains), however, is not challenged by the apparent lack of meaning compositionality. The verb and particle/preposition form a catena, and as such, they qualify as a concrete unit of syntax. The following dependency grammar trees illustrate the point:That constructions (including phrasal verb constructions) are catenae is a point established at length by Osborne and Groß (2012). ::Phrasal verbs tree 1 The words of each phrasal verb construction are highlighted in orange. These words form a catena because they are linked together in the vertical dimension. They constitute units of meaning, and these units are stored as multi-part wholes in the lexicon. Shifting A complex aspect of phrasal verbs concerns the distinction between prepositional verbs and particle verbs that are transitive (as discussed and illustrated above). Particle verbs that are transitive allow some variability in word order, depending on the relative weight of the constituents involved. Shifting often occurs when the object is very light, e.g. ::a. Fred chatted up the girl with red hair. – Canonical word order ::b. Fred chatted her up. – Shifting occurs because the definite pronoun her is very light. ::c. Fred chatted the girl up. \\\\- The girl is also very light. ::d. ?Fred chatted the redhead up. \\\\- A three-syllable object can appear in either position for many speakers. ::e. ??Fred chatted the girl with red hair up. – Shifting is unlikely unless it is sufficiently motivated by the weight of the constituents involved. ::a. They dropped off the kids from that war zone. – Canonical word order ::b. They dropped them off. – Shifting occurs because the definite pronoun them is very light. ::c. ??They dropped the kids from that war zone off. – Shifting is unlikely unless it is sufficiently motivated by the weight of the constituents involved. ::a. Mary made up a really entertaining story. – Canonical word order ::b. Mary made it up. – Shifting occurs because the definite pronoun it is very light. ::c. ??Mary made a really entertaining story up. – Shifting is unlikely unless it is sufficiently motivated by the weight of the constituents involved. Shifting occurs between two (or more) sister constituents that appear on the same side of their head. The lighter constituent shifts leftward and the heavier constituent shifts rightward, and this happens to accommodate the relative weight of the two. Dependency grammar trees are again used to illustrate the point: ::Phrasal verb trees 2 The trees illustrate when shifting can occur. English sentence structures that grow down and to the right are easier to process. There is a consistent tendency to place heavier constituents to the right, as is evident in the a-trees. Shifting is possible when the resulting structure does not contradict this tendency, as is evident in the b-trees. Note again that the particle verb constructions (in orange) qualify as catenae in both the a- and b-trees. Shifting does not alter this fact. Similar structures in other languages Phrasal verbs are represented in many languages by compound verbs. As a class, particle phrasal verbs belong to the same category as the separable verbs of other Germanic languages. For example in Dutch, de lamp aansteken (to light the lamp) becomes, in a principal clause, ik steek de lamp aan (I light the lamp on). Similarly, in German, das Licht einschalten (to switch on the light) becomes ich schalte das Licht ein (I switch the light on). A number of phrasal verbs exist in some Romance languages such as Lombard, spoken in Northern Italy, due to the influence of ancient Lombardic: Fa foeura (to do in: to eat up; to squander); Dà denter (to trade in; to bump into); Borlà giò (to fall down); Lavà sü (to wash up, as in English); Trà sü (to throw up, as in English); Trà vìa (to throw away, as in English); Serà sü (to lock up, as in English); Dà vià (to give away, as in English), and more. Some of these made their way into Italian, for instance far fuori (to get rid of); mangiare fuori (to eat out); andare d'accordo con (to get on/along with); buttare via (throw away).  Phrasal nouns  An extension of the concept of phrasal verb is that of phrasal noun, where a verb+particle complex is nominalized.Concerning the term phrasal noun, see McCarthy and O'dell (2007). The particles may come before or after the verb. ::standby: We are keeping the old equipment on standby, in case of emergency. ::back-up: Neil can provide technical backup if you need it. ::onset: The match was halted by the onset of rain. ::input: Try to come to the meeting – we'd value your input. If the particle is in first place, then the phrasal noun is never written with a hyphen, if the particle comes second, then there is sometimes a hyphen between the two parts of the phrasal noun. The two categories have different values. Particle-verb compounds in English are of ancient development, and are common to all Germanic languages, as well as to Indo-European languages in general. Those such as onset tend to retain older uses of the particles; in Old English on/an had a wider domain, which included areas now covered by at and in in English. Some such compound nouns have a corresponding phrasal verb but some do not, partly because of historical developments. The modern English verb+particle complex set on exists, but it means \\"start to attack\\" (set itself means start a process). Modern English has no exact verbal phrase equivalent to the older set on, but rather various combinations that apply different nuances to the idea of starting a process—such as winter has set in, set off on a journey, set up the stand, set out on a day trip, etc. Verb-particle compounds are a more modern development in English, and focus more on the action expressed by the compound. That is to say, they are more overtly verbal. See also * Cliché * Collocation * Ergative verb * Lexical unit * Light verb * Noun phrase Notes References  *Adger, D. 2003.

She was sworn in on June 3, 2013 as the Deputy Chief Justice of Kenya in a ceremony presided over by the President of Kenya and the Chief Justice. After a protracted case on the question of the retirement age of Judges who were appointed under the old Constitution of Kenya, the Supreme Court delivered a Ruling which effectively set the retirement age at 70 years, sending the Deputy Chief Justice and one other Supreme Court Judge who had reached 70 on retirement. Education and early career Rawal holds a Bachelor of Arts degree, and Bachelors and Master of Laws in constitutional and administrative law. She received her LLB and LLM degrees in India, where she practised for three years under the tutelage of P. N. Bhagwati who later became the 17th Chief Justice of India.http://www.jmvb.or.ke/images/documents/fourth_determinations.pdf In 1973, at the age of 27, Kalpana Hasmukhrai Rawal moved to Kenya from India to join her husband, businessman Hasmukhrai Rawal. Two years later, she set up her own law firm, becoming the first woman to run a law firm in Kenya - a move that put her in the long path to being appointed the first female judge of Asian origin by then President Daniel Moi. The remarkable woman from India would serve in the highest court in the land as the deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Her father U.J. Bhatt served as a judge in the Gujarat High Court and her grandfather Jaduram Bhatt who was a law minister. Kalpana was born in 1946 in Bhuj (Kutch), India to Umangilal (U.J) and Anuben Bhatt of Gujrat. When she was born, India was a conservative society and giving birth to daughters was no cause for celebration. Her parents, however, gave her and her four sisters the best education and she showed her worth by superseding their expectations and becoming the first female lawyer in Kenya. She was enrolled as an advocate of the High Court of Kenya in July, 1975. She had taught administration and regular police officers at Lower Kabete for a year. When she started her private practice, K H Rawal Advocates, the offices were located at Imenti House and she worked from there until 1999 when she was appointed Commissioner of Assize. In 1975 she worked as a teacher of both administration and regular police officers at Lower Kabete. In the same year, she set up a private practice becoming the first woman lawyer to do so in Kenya. She run a general practice until 1999 when she was appointed a commissioner of assize, and judge of the High Court thereafter. Judicial career Rawal has over 40 years experience in the legal profession and as at May 2011 had served as a judge for 11 years most of which was in Nairobi. A year later, the mother of two sons was appointed a Judge of the High Court of Kenya, and she consequently stopped working at her law firm which is still operational. During her tenure, she reformed each of the divisions in which she was appointed – Civil, Criminal, Family, Environmental and Land Law – by reducing severe backlog and improving the expeditious disposal of cases. In April, 2010, Rawal was appointed the Liaison Judge for Kenya making her a member of the International Hague Network of Judges and the Chief Justice also appointed her to assist the International Criminal Court (ICC) to take evidence of security officers in respect of the investigation into 2007/2008 Post Election Violence. In 2011, while still at the High Court, she delivered a judgment against the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, barring it from confiscating assets of Stanley Amuti, former National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation finance boss, to recover Sh140 million.

Opportunity came knocking on February 22, 2013 when the Judicial Service Commission nominated her for the position of Deputy Chief Justice. During her 40 years as a legal professional, Rawal played a big role and paved the way for many women in the justice system. Rawal’s pivotal role has not gone unnoticed and she was awarded the Elder of the Order of Burning Spear (EBS) by President Uhuru Kenyatta. =Chief Justice interviews= In May 2011, she was among nine applicants interviewed for the position Chief Justice of Kenya by the Judicial Service Commission (Kenya). She however lost to the then eventual appointee Chief Justice Willy Mutunga. =2012 Kenya Police helicopter crash inquiry= Justice Rawal led the judicial inquiry into the June 2012 Kenya Police helicopter crash that killed all six people on board including Minister George Saitoti and Assistant Minister Orwa Ojode. =Vetting Board decision= In September 2012, the Kenya Judges and Magistrates Vetting Board in its fourth Determination declared Rawal fit for office. It had earlier delayed its decision as she was among judges hearing a national interest case to determine on the date of the next Kenyan general elections.http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/-/1064/1458952/-/9ereni/-/index.html Deputy chief justice nomination Following the resignation of Nancy Barasa, Rawal applied for the vacant position of Deputy Chief Justice advertised by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) on 9 November 2012. The JSC however re- advertised because it was dissatisfied by the number of applicants. The position subsequently attracted applications from 17 women and one man. She was among five shortlisted for the position. On 22 February 2013, the JSC announced that after completing the interviews it had nominated Court of Appeal Judge Kalpana Rawal. She was successfully vetted by Parliament, and then appointed by the President as the Deputy Chief Justice and Vice President of the Supreme Court. Panama Papers After the a huge leaked set of 11.5 million confidential documents that provide detailed information on more than 214,000 offshore companies listed by the Panamanian corporate service provider Mossack Fonsec. According to the documents date to September 7, 2007, her husband set up investment companies to invest in the U.K. These were perfectly legitimate and legal but she was not to have any control over the same. U.K. laws as well as international law allowed and indeed encouraged offshore holdings and provided tax incentives for such investments. All her family's involvements were deemed perfectly legitimate. Retirement Having been born in January 1946, Lady Justice Kalpana Rawal was required to retire from the Supreme Court upon reaching 70 in January 2016 in line with Article 167(1) of the Constitution of Kenya. However, when the Judicial Service Commission served her with a retirement notice, she launched a protracted case insisting that she should leave office at 74 years since she was first appointed as a Judge under the old Constitution of Kenya which set the retirement age of Judges at 74.http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Rawal-contests-move-retire- her/-/1056/2866666/-/2ul0v8z/-/index.html Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal confirmed the retirement age as 70, but she filed a further appeal before her colleagues in the Supreme Court who delivered a ruling which effectively confirmed the retirement age as 70. She was therefore honourably retired on 14 June 2016. During her 40 years as a legal professional, Rawal played a big role and paved the way for many women in the justice system. Rawal’s pivotal role has not gone unnoticed and she was awarded the Elder of the Order of Burning Spear (EBS) by President Uhuru Kenyatta.

It has around 18,000 clinics, 16,000 homes for the elderly and those with special needs, and 5,500 hospitals, with 65 percent of them located in developing countries.Calderisi, Robert. Earthly Mission - The Catholic Church and World Development; TJ International Ltd; 2013; p.40 In 2010, the Church's Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers said that the Church manages 26% of the world's health care facilities. The Church's involvement in health care has ancient origins. Jesus Christ, whom the Church holds as its founder, instructed his followers to heal the sick. The early Christians were noted for tending the sick and infirm, and Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals. The influential Benedictine rule holds that \\"the care of the sick is to be placed above and before every other duty, as if indeed Christ were being directly served by waiting on them\\". During the Middle Ages, monasteries and convents were the key medical centres of Europe and the Church developed an early version of a welfare state. Cathedral schools evolved into a well integrated network of medieval universities and Catholic scientists (many of them clergymen) made a number of important discoveries which aided the development of modern science and medicine. Saint Albert the Great (1206–1280) was a pioneer of biological field research; Desiderius Erasmus (1466-1536) helped revive knowledge of ancient Greek medicine, Renaissance popes were often patrons of the study of anatomy, and Catholic artists such as Michelangelo advanced knowledge of the field through sketching cadavers. The Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1602 – 1680) first proposed that living beings enter and exist in the blood (a precursor of germ theory). The Augustinian Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) developed theories on genetics for the first time. As Catholicism became a global religion, the Catholic orders and religious and lay people established health care centres around the world. Women's religious institutes such as the Sisters of Charity, Sisters of Mercy and Sisters of St Francis opened and operated some of the first modern general hospitals. While the prioritization of charity and healing by early Christians created the hospital, their spiritual emphasis tended to imply \\"the subordination of medicine to religion and doctor to priest\\". \\"[P]hysic and faith\\", wrote historian of medicine Roy Porter \\"while generally complementary... sometimes tangled in border disputes.\\" Similarly in modern times, the moral stance of the Church against contraception and abortion has been a source of controversy. The Church, while being a major provider of health care to HIV AIDS sufferers, and of orphanages for unwanted children, has been criticised for opposing condom use. Due to Catholics' belief in the sanctity of life from conception, IVF, which leads to the destruction of many embryos, surrogacy, which relies on IVF, and embryonic stem-cell research, which necessitates the destruction of embryos, are among other areas of controversy for the Church in the provision of health care. Theological basis: euntes docete et curate infirmos St Matthew the Evangelist and an Angel, 1661, by Rembrandt. St Matthew, one of the authors of the New Testament, wrote that Jesus wanted his followers to care for the sick. Catholic social teaching urges concern for the sick. Jesus Christ, whom the church holds as its founder, placed a particular emphasis on care for the sick and outcast, such as lepers. According to the New Testament, he and his Apostles went about curing the sick and anointing of the sick.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011 According to the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, which is found in Matthew 25, Jesus identified so strongly with the sick and afflicted that he equated serving them with serving him: The Good Samaritan by alt= In a 2013 presentation to its twenty-seventh international conference in 2013, the President of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers, Zygmunt Zimowski, said that \\"The Church, adhering to the mandate of Jesus, 'Euntes docete et curate infirmos' (Mt 10:6-8, Go, preach and heal the sick), during the course of her history, which by now has lasted two millennia, has always attended to the sick and the suffering.\\" In orations such as his Sermon on the Mount and stories such as the Parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus called on followers to worship God (Rpm 12:1-2) through care for our neighbor: the sick, hungry and poor. Such teachings formed the foundation of Catholic Church involvement in hospitals and health care. According to Dr. James Joseph Walsh, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia: The Benedictine rule, which led the profusion of medieval hospitals founded by the Church, requires that \\"the care of the sick is to be placed above and before every other duty, as if indeed Christ were being directly served by waiting on them\\".Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.112 History alt= =Antiquity= Ancient Greek and Roman medicine developed solid foundations over seven centuries, creating, Porter wrote, \\"the ideal of a union of science, philosophy and practical medicine in the learned physician...\\". But Greek and Roman religion did not preach of a duty to tend to the sick. Christianity emerged into this world as a Jewish sect in the mid-1st century and early Christians from the outset went about tending the sick and infirm. Their priests were often also physicians. St Luke the Evangelist, credited as one of the authors of The New Testament, was a physician. Christian emphasis on practical charity was to give rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals after the end of the persecution of the early church. The early Christian outlook on sickness drew on various traditions, including Eastern asceticism and Jewish healing traditions, while the New Testament wrote of Jesus and his Apostles as healers. Porter wrote: \\"While suffering and disease could appear as chastisement of the wicked or a trial of those the Lord loved, the Church also developed a healing mission\\". Pagan religions seldom offered help to the sick, but the early Christians were willing to nurse the sick and take food to them. Notably during the smallpox epidemic of AD 165–180 and the measles outbreak of around AD 250, \\"In nursing the sick and dying, regardless of religion, the Christians won friends and sympathisers\\", wrote historian Geoffrey Blainey. Hospitality was considered an obligation of Christian charity and bishops' houses and the valetudinaria of wealthier Christians were used to tend the sick. Deacons were assigned the task of distributing alms, and in Rome by 250 AD the Church had developed an extensive charitable outreach, with wealthy converts supporting the poor. It is believed that the first church hospitals were constructed in the East, and only later in the Latin West. An early hospital may have been built at Constantinople during the age of Constantine by St. Zoticus. St. Basil built a famous hospital at Cæsarea in Cappadocia which \\"had the dimensions of a city\\". In the West, Saint Fabiola founded a hospital at Rome around 400. Saint Jerome wrote that Fabiola founded a hospital and \\"assembled all the sick from the streets and highways\\" and \\"personally tended the unhappy and impoverished victims of hunger and disease... washed the pus from sores that others could not even behold\\" Santa Maria della Scala Hospital, one of Europe's oldest hospitals. Several early Christian healers are honoured as Saints in the Catholic tradition. Cosmas and Damian, brothers from Cilicia in Asia Minor, supplanted the pagan Asclepius as the patron saints of medicine and were celebrated for their healing powers..\\" Said to have lived in the late Third Century AD and to have performed a miraculous first leg transplant on a patient, and later martyred under the Emperor Diocletian, Cosmos and Damian appear in the heraldry of barber-surgeon companies..\\" Notable contributors to the medical sciences of those early centuries include Tertullian (born A.D. 160), Clement of Alexandria, Lactantius and the learned St. Isidore of Seville (d. 636). St. Benedict of Nursia (480) emphasised medicine as an aid to the provision of hospitality. The martyr Saint Pantaleon was said to be physician to the Emperor Galerius, who sentenced him to death for his Christianity. Since the Middle Ages, Pantaleon has been considered a patron saint of physicians and midwives. Saint Benedict of Nursia. The administration of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires split and the demise of the Western Empire by the sixth century was accompanied by a series of violent invasions, and precipitated the collapse of cities and civic institutions of learning, along with their links to the learning of classical Greece and Rome. For the next thousand years, medical knowledge would change very little..\\" A scholarly medical tradition maintained itself in the more stable East, but in the West, scholarship virtually disappeared outside of the Church, where monks were aware of a dwindling range of medical texts..\\" The legacy of this early period was, in the words of Porter, that \\"Christianity planted the hospital: the well-endowed establishments of the Levant and the scattered houses of the West shared a common religious ethos of charity.\\". =Middle Ages= Geoffrey Blainey likened the Catholic Church in its activities during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: \\"It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal\\". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 214-215. It was common for monks and clerics to practice medicine and medical students in northern European universities often took minor Holy orders. Mediaeval hospitals had a strongly Christian ethos and were, in the words of historian of medicine Roy Porter, \\"religious foundations through and through\\"; Ecclesiastical regulations were passed to govern medicine, partly to prevent clergymen profiting from medicine.Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 110-112 John XXI was a medieval pope and physician who wrote popular medical texts. After a period of decline, the Holy Roman Emperor Charlamagne had decreed that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery. Following his death, the hospitals again declined, but by the tenth century monasteries were the leading providers of hospital work – among them the Benedictine Abbey of Cluny. Charlemagne's decree required each monastery and Cathedral chapter to establish a school and in these schools medicine was commonly taught. Gerbert of Aurillac (c. 946 – 12 May 1003), known to history as Pope Sylvester II, taught medicine at one such school. Petrus of Spain (1210-1277) was a physician who wrote the popular Treasury of the Poor medical text and became Pope John XXI in 1276. St Hildegard of Bingen dictating to a scribe. Hildegarde is recognised as a doctor of the church, and was among the most distinguished of Medieval Catholic women scientists. Other famous physicians and medical researchers of the Middle Ages include the Abbot of Monte Cassino Bertharius, the Abbot of Reichenau Walafrid Strabo, the Abbess St Hildegard of Bingen and the Bishop of Rennes Marbodus of Angers. Monasteries of this era were diligent in the study of medicine, and often too were convents. Hildegard of Bingen, a doctor of the church, is among the most distinguished of Medieval Catholic women scientists. Other than theological works, Hildegard also wrote Physica, a text on the natural sciences, as well as Causae et Curae. Hildegard was well known for her healing powers involving practical application of tinctures, herbs, and precious stones.Maddocks, Fiona. Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age (New York: Doubleday, 2001), 155. In keeping with the Benedictine rule that the care of the sick be placed above all other duties, monasteries were the key medical care providers prior to 1300. Most monasteries offered shelter for pilgrims and an infirmary for sick monks, while separate hospitals were founded for the public. The Benedictine order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries, growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts. The Capuchin monks sought a revival of the ideals of Francis of Assisi, offering care after plague struck at Camerino in 1523. Healing shrines were established and different saints came to be invoked for every body part in the hope of miraculous cures.Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.111 Some of the shrines remain to the present day, and were in the Middle Ages great centres for pilgrims, complete with relics and souvenirs.Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.112 St Luke or St Michael were invoked for various ailments, and a host of saints for individuals conditions, including St Roch as a protector against plague.Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 111 St Roch is venerated as one who provided care to plague suffers, only to fall sick himself and be \\"healed by an angel\\". Through the devastating Bubonic Plague, the Franciscans were notable for tending the sick. The apparent impotence of medical knowledge against the disease prompted critical examination. Medical scientists came to divide among anti-Galenists, anti-Arabists and positive Hippocratics. Crusader orders established several new traditions of Catholic medical care.Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 112-113 The famous Knights Hospitaller arose as a group of individuals associated with an Amalfitan hospital in Jerusalem, which was built to provide care for poor, sick or injured pilgrims to the Holy Land. Following the capture of the city by Crusaders, the order became a military as well as infirmarian order. The Knights of St John of Jerusalem were later known as the Knights of Malta. The Knights Templar and Teutonic Knights established hospitals around the Mediterranean and through Germanic lands.Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.113 Saint Albert Magnus was a pioneer of biological field research. Non-military orders of brothers also took up the service of the infirm. By the 15th century, the brothers of the Order of the Holy Spirit were providing care across Europe, and by the sixteenth century the Spanish-founded Order of St John of God had set up about 200 hospitals in the Americas. In Catholic Spain amidst the early Reconquista, Archbishop Raimund founded an institution for translations, which employed a number of Jewish translators to communicate the works of Arabian medicine. Influenced by the rediscovery of Aristotelian thought, churchmen like the Dominican Albert Magnus and the Franciscan Roger Bacon made significant advances in the observation of nature. Small hospitals for pilgrims sprung up in the West during the early Middle Ages, but by the latter part of the period had grown more substantial, with hospitals founded for lepers, pilgrims, the sick, aged and poor. Milan, Siena, Paris and Florence had numerous and large hospitals. \\"Within hospitals walls\\", wrote Porter, \\"the Christian ethos was all pervasive\\". From just 12 beds in 1288, the Sta Maria Nuova in Florence \\"gradually expanded by 1500 to a medical staff of ten doctors, a pharmacist, and several assistants, including female surgeons\\", and was boasted of as the \\"first hospital among Christians\\". Clergy were active at the School of Salerno, the oldest medical school in Western Europe – among the important churchmen to teach there were Alpuhans, later (1058–85) Archbishop of Salerno, and the influential Constantine of Carthage, a monk who produced superior translations of Hippocrates and investigated Arab literature. Cathedral schools began in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education, some of them ultimately evolving into medieval universities. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well- integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of enquiry and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research. Porter wrote that, \\"The great age of hospital building from around 1200 coincided with the flourishing of universities in Italy, Spain, France and England, sustained by the new wealth of the High Middle Ages. ... The Universities extended the work of Salerno in medical education\\". =Renaissance= From the 14th century, the European Renaissance saw a revival of interest in Classical learning in Western Europe, coupled with and fuelled by the spread of new inventions like the printing press. The Fall of Constantinople brought refugee scholars from the Greek East to the West. The Catholic scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1466-1536) was interested in medicine and influential in reviving Greek as a language of learning, and the study of the pre-Christian works of Galen. Roy Porter wrote that \\"after centuries where the Church had taught mankind to renounce worldly goods, for the sake of eternity, Renaissance man showed an insatiable curiosity for the materiality of the here and now...\\".Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 168-170 In Renaissance Italy, the Popes were often patrons of the study of anatomy and Catholic artists such as Michelangelo advanced knowledge of the field through such studies as sketching cadavers to improve his portraits of the crucifixion. It is often wrongly asserted that the papacy banned dissection during the period, though in fact the directive of Pope Sixtus IV of 1482 to the University of Tübingen said that the Church had no objection to anatomy studies, provided the bodies belonged to an executed criminal, and was given a religious burial once examinations were completed. Gregor Mendel, Augustinian Friar and scientist, who developed theories on genetics for the first time. =Development of modern medicine= In modern times, the Catholic Church is the largest non- government provider of health care in the world. Catholic religious have been responsible for founding and running networks of hospitals across the world where medical research continues to be advanced. In 2013, Robert Calderisi wrote that the Catholic Church has around 18,000 clinics, 16,000 homes for the elderly and those with special needs, and 5,500 hospitals – with 65 per cent of them located in developing countries. Europe The French Saint Jeanne Jugan (1792-1879) founded the Little Sisters of the Poor who specialise in care for the aged. Catholic scientists in Europe (many of them clergymen) made a number of important discoveries which aided the development of modern science and medicine. Catholic women were also among the first female professors of medicine, as with Trotula of Salerno the 11th century physician and Dorotea Bucca who held a chair of medicine and philosophy at the University of Bologna. The Jesuit order, created during the Reformation, contributed a number of distinguished medical scientists. In the field of bacteriology it was the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1671) who first proposed that living beings enter and exist in the blood (a precursor of germ theory). In the development of ophthalmology, Christoph Scheiner made important advances in relation to refraction of light and the retinal image. Gregor Mendel, an Austrian scientist and Augustinian friar, began experimenting with peas around 1856.Jacob Bronowski; The Ascent of Man; Angus & Robertson, 1973 Mendel had joined the Brno Augustinian Monastery in 1843, but also trained as a scientist at the Olmutz Philosophical Institute and the University of Vienna. The Brno Monastery was a centre of scholarship, with an extensive library and tradition of scientific research.Bill Bryson; A Short History of Nearly Everything; Black Swan; 2004; p.474 Observing the processes of pollination at his monastery in modern Czechoslovakia, Mendel studied and developed theories pertaining to the field of science now called genetics. Mendel published his results in 1866 in the Journal of the Brno Natural History Society, and is considered the father of modern genetics. Where Charles Darwin's theories suggested a mechanism for improvement of species over generations, Mendel's observations provided explanation for how a new species itself could emerge. Though Darwin and Mendel never collaborated, they were aware of each other's work (Darwin read a paper by Wilhelm Olbers Focke which extensively referenced Mendel). Bill Bryson wrote that \\"without realizing it, Darwin and Mendel laid the groundwork for all of life sciences in the twentieth century. Darwin saw that all living things are connected, that ultimately they trace their ancestry to a single, common source; Mendel's work provided the mechanism to explain how that could happen\\".Bill Bryson; A Short History of Nearly Everything; Black Swan; 2004; p.474-476 Catholic religious institutes, notably those for women, developed many hospitals throughout Europe and its empires. Ancient orders like the Dominicans and Carmelites have long lived in religious communities that work in ministries such as education and care of the sick. The Portuguese Saint John of God (d. 1550) founded the Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God to care for the sick and afflicted. The order built hospitals across Europe and its growing empires. In 1898, John was declared patron of the dying and of all hospitals by Pope Leo XIII. The Italian Saint Camillus de Lellis, considered a patron saint of nurses, was a reformed gambler and soldier who became a nurse and then director of Romes's Hospital of St. James, the hospital for incurables. In 1584 he founded the Camillians to tend to the plague-stricken. Irishwoman Catherine McAuley founded the Sisters of Mercy in Dublin in 1831. Her congregation went on to found schools and hospitals across the globe. Saint Jeanne Jugan founded the Little Sisters of the Poor on the Rule of Saint Augustine to assist the impoverished elderly of the streets of France in the mid-nineteenth century. It too spread around the world. In 2017, controversy arose when an Associated Press report, which the Vatican criticized, stated that Bambino Gesu (Baby Jesus) Pediatric Hospital, a cornerstone of Italy's health care system and administered by the Holy See, put children at risk between 2008 and 2015 and turned its attention to profit after losing money and expanding services. The Americas Hospicio Cabañas was the largest hospital in colonial America, in Guadalajara, Mexico The Spanish and Portuguese Empires were largely responsible for spreading the Catholic faith and its philosophy regarding health care to South and Central America, where the church established substantial hospital networks. Catholic hospitals were established in the modern United States prior to the American War of Independence. The first was probably Charity Hospital, New Orleans, established around 1727. The Sisters of Saint Francis of Syracuse, New York, produced Saint Marianne Cope, who opened and operated some of the first general hospitals in the United States, instituting cleanliness standards which influenced the development of America's modern hospital system, and famously taking her nuns to Hawaii to work with Saint Damien of Molokai in the care of lepers. St Damien himself is considered a martyr of charity and model of Catholic humanitarianism for his mission to the lepers of Molokai. The Catholic Church is the largest private provider of health care in the United States of America.The Health Care Debate: The Catholic Church; Catholic Leaders' Dilema: Abortion vs. Universal Care; by Gustav Niebuhr, New York Times, 25 August 1994. During the 1990s, the church provided about one in six hospital beds in America, at around 566 hospitals, many established by nuns. The church has carried a disproportionate number of poor and uninsured patients at its facilities and the American bishops first called for universal health care in America in 1919. The church has been an active campaigner in that cause ever since. In the abortion debate in America, the church has sought to retain the right not to perform abortions in its health care facilities. In 2012, the church operated 12.6% of hospitals in the US, accounting for 15.6% of all admissions, and around 14.5% of hospital expenses (c. 98.6 billion dollars). Compared to the public system, the church provided greater financial assistance or free care to poor patients, and was a leading provider of various low-profit health services such as breast cancer screenings, nutrition programs, trauma, and care of the elderly. Roman Catholic medical facilities refuse treatment which runs counter to their beliefs. Contraception is a treatment that is not provided, and complications due to existing contraception may not be treated. Users may be unaware of these restrictions, even unaware that their health provider is connected with the Roman Catholic Church until something goes wrong. For example, a woman bleeding and in pain due to a misplaced intrauterine contraceptive device was refused treatment. However, the hospital's director of mission integration, Marty Folan, denied that the removal of IUDs went against hospital policy. Asia Salesian sister caring for sick and poor in former Madras Presidency, India. Catholic women have been heavily involved as care givers. During the Middle Ages, Arab medicine was influential on Europe. During Europe's Age of Discovery, Catholic missionaries, notably the Jesuits, introduced the modern sciences to India, China and Japan. While persecutions continue to limit the spread of Catholic institutions to some Middle Eastern Muslim nations, places such as the People's Republic of China and North Korea, elsewhere in Asia the church is a major provider of health care services – especially in Catholic nations like the Philippines. The famous Mother Teresa of Calcutta established the Missionaries of Charity in the slums of Calcutta in 1948 to work among \\"the poorest of the poor\\". Initially founding a school, she then gathered other sisters who \\"rescued new-born babies abandoned on rubbish heaps; they sought out the sick; they took in lepers, the unemployed, and the mentally ill\\". Teresa achieved fame in the 1960s and began to establish convents around the world. By the time of her death in 1997, the religious institute she founded had more than 450 centres in over 100 countries. Mother Theresa encouraged a daily prayer for the Mother Theresa Children's Home: Oceania St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia, was established by the Sisters of Charity and became an early leader in AIDS treatment. It remains among many leading medical research centres established by the Catholic Church around the world. St Damien of Molokai famously established a mission among the lepers of Molokai, Hawaii. French, Portuguese, British and Irish missionaries brought Catholicism to Oceania and built hospitals and care centres across the region. The church remains not only a key provider of health care in predominantly Catholic nations like East Timor but also in predominantly Protestant and secular nations like Australia and New Zealand. As restrictions were lifted by British authorities on the practice of Catholicism in colonial Australia, Catholic religious institutes founded many of Australia's hospitals. Irish Sisters of Charity arrived in Sydney in 1838 and established St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, in 1857 as a free hospital for the poor. The Sisters went on to found hospitals, hospices, research institutes and aged care facilities in Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania. At St Vincent's they trained leading surgeon Victor Chang and opened Australia's first AIDS clinic. In the 21st century, with more and more lay people involved in management, the sisters began collaborating with Sisters of Mercy Hospitals in Melbourne and Sydney. Jointly the group operates four public hospitals; seven private hospitals and 10 aged care facilities. The Sisters of Mercy arrived in Auckland in 1850 and were the first order of religious sisters to come to New Zealand; they began work in health care and education. The Sisters of St Joseph was founded in Australia by Australia's first Saint, Mary MacKillop, and Fr Julian Tenison Woods in 1867. MacKillop travelled throughout Australasia and established schools, convents and charitable institutions. The English Sisters of the Little Company of Mary arrived in 1885 and have since established public and private hospitals, retirement living and residential aged care, community care and comprehensive palliative care in New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory. The Little Sisters of the Poor, who follow the charism of Saint Jeanne Jugan to \\"offer hospitality to the needy aged\\" arrived in Melbourne in 1884 and now operate four aged care homes in Australia. Catholic Health Australia is today the largest non-government provider grouping of health, community and aged care services in Australia. These do not operate for profit and range across the full spectrum of health services, representing about 10% of the health sector and employing 35,000 people. Catholic organisations in New Zealand remain heavily involved in community activities including education, health services, chaplaincy to prisons, rest homes, and hospitals, social justice, and human rights advocacy. Africa Catholicism has grown rapidly in Africa over the last two centuries. As in all other continents, Catholic missionaries established health care centres across the continent – though limitations on Catholic institutions remain in place for much of Muslim North Africa. Caritas Internationalis is the Church's main international aid and development body and operates in over 200 countries and territories and co-operates closely with the United Nations.UNAIDS requests Pope Benedict XVI for support in efforts to stop new HIV infections in children; UNAIDS Feature Story; 11 April 2012 =HIV/AIDS= Pope Paul VI issued the Humanae Vitae Encyclical Letter on the Regulation of Birth in 1968, which outlined opposition to \\"artificial birth control\\" on the basis that it would open a \\"wide and easy road ... towards conjugal infidelity and the general lowering of morality\\".

According to Reverend Jeffery Ott of Our Lady of Lourdes in Atlanta, Georgia, the church had to omit the sharing of wine in the chalice during Holy Communion.https://www.reuters.com/article/us- health-coronavirus-usa-churches/no-hugs-handshakes-as-u-s-churches-take-new- precautions-against-coronavirus-idUSKBN20V0Z8 Contemporary issues=Bioethics= Because the Catholic Church opposes abortion, euthanasia and contraception and other health procedures, Catholic health facilities will not provide most or all such services. In public debates, particularly among Western nations like the United States, this has raised questions over insurance public/private financial co-operation and government interference and regulation of health facilities. Writing in 2012, the Australian human rights lawyer and Jesuit Frank Brennan, in response to calls for public funding to Catholic hospitals to be contingent on them offering the \\"full suites of services\\", said that: The Catholic Church's opposition to abortion has also restricted its hospitals' treatment of miscarriages. In cases where evacuation of the miscarriage from the uterus is medically indicated, doctors have been prohibited from carrying it out while a fetal heartbeat is still present, \\"in effect delaying care until fetal heart tones cease, the pregnant woman becomes ill, or the patient is transported to a non–Catholic-owned facility for the procedure.\\" A number of controversies have arisen over the application of these treatments in Catholic hospitals, or the lack thereof; for instance, in the United States, a member of a hospital ethics committee was excommunicated when she approved a therapeutic, direct abortion to save a patient's life, and in Germany a case of two hospitals turning away and refusing to examine or treat a rape victim led to new guidelines from the country's bishops stating that hospitals could provide emergency contraception to victims of rape.German bishops agree Catholic hospitals can prescribe emergency contraception to rape victims / AP, February 21, 2013 As regards IVF and surrogacy, the Church's teaching, which states that every human life is sacred from conception until natural death, and that the vulnerable should be protected, therefore finds that this technology, which leads to the death of many embryos for each successful pregnancy, to be an abuse of power at the cost of the weakest.\\"Church teaching on in vitro fertilization\\", Catholic World Report, retrieved 19 May 2015 However, Catholics have been active in developing alternative treatments for infertility and especially addressing its root causes, which, in addition to causing infertility or risk of miscarriage, are likely to have other consequences on health, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, thyroid conditions and endometriosis.

The Engadin window or (Lower Engadin window) is a tectonic window that exposes penninic units lying below the austroalpine units in the alpine nappe stack. It has a roughly elliptical shape with the long axis striking northwest- southeast and dimensions of 55 x 17 km. From a geographic perspective the window stretches from Zernez (Graubünden, Switzerland) to Landeck (Tirol, Austria), or the Lower Engadin. Overview The rocks cropping out in the Engadin window are weakly metamorphosed sediments of middle Jurassic to Eocene age. Most of them are interpreted as deposits from turbidites. They are seen as part of the penninic units similar to the rocks that make up large portions of the Switzerland. Furthermore, the sediments are attributed to the Valais ocean, the Briançonnais microcontinent, and the Piemont-Liguria Ocean. The metamorphic overprint was caused by the closure of the Valais and the Piemont- Liguria during the Paleogene part of the Alpine orogeny. The rocks experienced low-temperature-high-pressure overprint which reached the blueschist facies. On geologic maps the Engadine window has an onion shell appearance.

Mark, who received a Grammy in 2004, lives in Rotorua, New Zealand.  Biography  Jon Mark was born in Falmouth, Cornwall, England. Using his given name, he and a former schoolmate, Alun Davies; singer-songwriter, folk guitarist and skiffle musician, (later of Cat Stevens' band), recorded as a duo, an album entitled Relax Your Mind, on Decca Records.Anderson, Murphy,. Magicat: Relax Your Mind With Jon and Alun Both travelled extensively throughout the UK, and France, busking until they secured a job entertaining on a Cunard Line cruise ship. From 1965 on Mark accompanied Marianne Faithfull on her recordings and concerts. Moreover he wrote and arranged some songs for her. In 1968 Mark and Davies founded the short-lived five-piece band Sweet Thursday which was composed of Mark, Davies, Nicky Hopkins, Harvey Burns, and Brian Odgers. In December 1968 Tetragrammaton released a single which contained \\"Getting It Together\\" (Side A) and \\"Mary on the Runaround\\" (Side B) which were composed by Mark but were not included on the group's lone album, the eponymous Sweet Thursday on Fontana Records. However, the album was not promoted by their record label, and the bandmates never toured. Fontana later declared bankruptcy. Hence Mark joined John Mayall's (post-Bluesbreakers) with whom he toured and recorded The Turning Point (1969) and Empty Rooms (1969). There he met Johnny Almond with whom he decided to form Mark-Almond. Mark-Almond's first two albums, Mark-Almond (1971) and Mark-Almond II (1972) were recorded for Bob Krasnow's Blue Thumb label, and were noted for their embossed envelope-style album covers. For the first album, The Ghetto received many plaudits and from the second \\"One Way Sunday\\" was a hit for them in the United States and received radio airplay on album-oriented rock stations in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. The group then recorded two albums for Columbia Records, Rising (1972) and the live album, Mark-Almond 73 (1973), by which time the group's members had grown to seven. In October 1972,Rolling Stone: \\"Random notes. A bad mishap for Jon Mark of Mark/Almond. In Hawaii on tour with Joe Cocker last Sunday, he fell out of a tree and lost the ring finger on his left Hand.\\" 26 October 1972. Mark was involved in an accident in Hawaii and lost most of his left-hand ring finger.John Halsey: Patto – the John Halsey Interview. (PDF; 306 kB) \\"What Am I Living For\\" from Mark-Almond 73 gained the group the most US radio airplay they would get, but nevertheless they disbanded later that year. Mark released a solo record for Columbia Song for a Friend in 1975. He and Almond reunited in 1975 and released the outstanding To the Heart on ABC Records (which had acquired Blue Thumb) in 1976, which featured the drummer Billy Cobham. Other notable musicians, who have recorded or toured with Mark-Almond include drummer Dannie Richmond, violinist Greg Bloch, keyboardist Tommy Eyre and bassist Roger Sutton. Eyre and Sutton later teamed in Riff Raff. A&M; Records signed the duo in 1978 and released Other Peoples Rooms, but the record did not sell as well as earlier releases. Mark-Almond disbanded again in the mid 1980s, after releasing two decent albums, Tuesday in New York (1980) and a live offering The Last & Live (1981). In 1996 Mark-Almond reunited again for a CD release, Night Music, which featured keyboardist Mike Nock and others. Mark moved to New Zealand in the mid 1980s, and released a number of successful solo Ambient music recordings on his White Cloud record label, as well as collaborating with other artists on traditional Celtic and folk recordings and producing other artists. A release of Tibetan Monk chants Mark recorded and produced with his wife Thelma Burchell won a Grammy Award in 2004.

The Sarvastivadins in order to explain the unity of the mind described the mind as a ground or base which they called Cittabhumi. They rejected the realm of unconsciousness, alaya-vijnana, postulated by the Yogacarins of Mahayana Buddhism who believed that from the realm of unconsciousness arose the conscious mind and the objects. But the Sarvastivadins recognised five types of Cittabhumi from which psychological phenomenon arose. Citta i.e. the mind, that alongside Manas, Buddhi and Ahamkara is an internal organ, whose function is recollection, constituted by three Gunas viz Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, reflects the self in accordance with any one of its modified states, vritti, which are Pramāṇa with its three kinds of cognition – perception, inference and verbal testimony, Vikalpa which is mere verbal idea caused by meaningless words, Viparyaya which is knowledge of things as they are not, Nidra or dreamless sleep and Smrti or memory. These reflections result in the self being afflicted by Klesas – Avidya (wrong or false knowledge), Asmita (false notion or perception), Raga (attachment), Dvea (aversion), and Abhnivesha (fear of death). Thus, the mind may remain in five different levels which mental levels or functions or stages, five in number, are known as Cittabhumi These five stages of the mind, as defined by Vyasa, are:- :• Ksipta or distracted. The distracted mind being overpowered by Rajas is extremely unsteady unable to concentrate or decide, and is the source of pleasure or pain. :• Mudha or infatuated. The infatuated mind being overpowered by Tamas succumbs to commit unrighteous acts influenced by violent emotions. :• Viksipta or occasionally steady. The occasionally steady mind, unsteady for most part, influenced by Sattva is able to withdraw itself from painful objects and become fixed on pleasurable objects. :• Ekagra or one-pointed. The one-pointed mind influenced by pure Sattva is able to withdraw from all objects i.e. totally introverted, to remain focussed on one object. :• Niruddha or restrained. The restrained mind also influenced by pure Sattva arrests all mental functions i.e. there is complete suspension of all mental modes and sub-conscious dispositions. The first three afore-mentioned stages of mind are unfit for concentration for they are attended by mental modes. Yoga is not possible in these conditions. Ordinary people live on the level of Ksipta or Mudha. The last two mentioned stages are conducive to yoga and for Samadhi. Ekagra stage is also called Sampramata yoga in which the mind assumes the form of the object itself. Niruddha stage is known as Samprajnata yoga or Samadhi in which nothing is known or thought of by the mind. In the Yoga system Buddhi (intellect), Ahamkara (ego) and Indriyas (senses) are often called Citta.

It can be obtained as flat crystals with a purple-red color and metallic sheen (hence the \\"purple bronze\\" name). This compound is one of several molybdenum bronzes with general formula where A is an alkali metal or thallium Tl. It stands out among them (and also among the sub-class of \\"purple\\" molybdenum bronzes) for its peculiar electrical properties, including a marked anisotropy that makes it a \\"quasi-1D\\" conductor, and a metal-to-insulator transition as it is cooled below 30 K. Preparation The compound was first obtained by Martha Greenblatt and others by a temperature gradient flux technique. In a typical preparation, a stoichometric melt of , and is maintained in a temperature gradient from 490 to 640 °C over 15 cm in vacuum over several days. Excess reagents are dissolved with a hot potassium carbonate solution releasing metallic-purple plate-like crystals, a couple mm wide and less than a mm thick. Structure  The crystal structure of was determined by Onoda and others through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal system is monoclinic, with approximate unit cell dimensions a = 1.2762 nm, b = 0.5523 nm, and c = 0.9499 nm, with angle β = 90.61°, volume V = 0.6695 nm3 and Z = 2. In typical crystals, a is the shortest dimension (perpendicular to the plates) and b the longest. The density is 4.24 g/cm3. The structure is rather different from that of potassium molybdenum purple bronze , except that both are organized in layers. The difference may be explained by the relative sizes of the and ions. The unit cell contains six crystallographically independent molybdenum sites. One-third of the molybdenum atoms are surrounded by four oxygens, two thirds are surrounded by six oxygens. The crystal is a stack of slabs; each slab consists of three layers of distorted octahedra sharing corners. The lithium ions are inserted in the large vacant sites between the slabs. There are zigzag chains of alternating molybdenum and oxygen atoms extending along the b axis. Properties Lithium molybdenum purple bronze is quite different than the sodium, potassium and thallium analogs. It has a three-dimensional crystal structure, but a pseudo-one-dimensional (1D) metallic character, eventually becoming a superconductor at about 2 K Its properties are most spectacular below 5 meV. The Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory has been invoked to explain its anomalous behavior. = Electrical conductivity= At room temperature, Greenblatt and others (in 1984) measured the resistivity of lithium purple bronze along the a, b and c axes as 2.47 Ω cm, 0.0095 Ω cm, and on the order of 0.25 Ω cm, respectively. The conductivities would be in the ratio 1:250:10, which would make this compound an almost one-dimensional conductor. However, Da Luz and others (2007) measured 0.079, 0.018, and 0.050 Ω cm, respectively, which corresponds to conductivity ratios 1:6:2.4 for a:b:c; whereas H. Chen and others (2010) measured 0.854, 0.016, and 0.0645 Ω cm, respectively, which correspond to conductivity ratios of 1:53:13. This anisotropy has been attributed to the crystal structure, specifically to the zig-zag chains of molybdenum and oxygen atoms = Resistivity and temperature = The resistivity along all three axes increases linearly with temperature from about 30 K to 300 K, as in a metal. This is anomalous since such a law is expected above the Debye temperature (= 400 K for this compound) The resistivity ratios along the three axes are preserved in that range. = Metal-insulator transition = As the lithium purple bronze is cooled from 30 K to 20, it changes abruptly to an insulator. After reaching a minimum at about 24 K, the resistivity increases 10-fold and becomes somewhat more isotropic, with conductivities 1:25:14. The anisotropy is partially restored if a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the b axis. The transition may be related to the onset of a charge density wave. Santos and others have observed that the thermal expansion coefficient is largest along the a axis, so cooling will bring the conducting chains closer together, leading to a dimensional cross-over. The theory of Luttinger liquids then predicts such behavior. Anyway, as of 2010 there was no consensus explanation for this transition. = Superconducting state = Lithium molybdenum purple bronze becomes superconductor between 1 and 2 K. =Thermal conductivity= Li0.9Mo6O17, due to spin–charge separation, can have a much higher thermal conductivity than predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law. Wiedemann-Franz Law: Physicists break 150-year-old empirical laws of physics,Gross violation of the Wiedemann–Franz law in a quasi-one-dimensional conductor Wakeham et al. 2011 = Magnetoresistance = The magnetoresistance of lithium purple bronze is negative when the magnetic field is applied along the b-axis, but large and positive when the field is applied along the a-axis and the c-axis.

He is one of the foremost visual artists of the Khartoum School of African Modernism and the Hurufiyya art movement, which sought to combine traditional forms of Islamic calligraphy with contemporary artworks. On the occasion of the Tate Modern gallery's first retrospective exhibition of a contemporary artist from Africa in 2013, El- Salahi's artistic work was characterized as \\"a new Sudanese visual vocabulary, which arose from his own pioneering integration of Islamic, African, Arab and Western artistic traditions.\\"  Life and career  Ibrahim El-Salahi was born on 5 September 1930 in El-Abbasyia, a neighborhood of Omdurman, Sudan, to a Muslim family and is considered to be one of the most important contemporary African artists. His father was in charge of a Qur'anic school, where El- Salahi learned to read and write and to practice Arabic calligraphy, that later became an important element in his artwork. From 1949 to 1950, he studied Fine Art at the School of Design of the Gordon Memorial College, which later became the University of Khartoum. Supported by a scholarship, he subsequently went to the Slade School of Fine Art in London from 1954 to 1957. At this art school, El-Salahi was exposed to European schooling, modern circles, and the works of artists that gradually influenced his art. Studying in London also allowed him to take formal and ideological cues from modernist painting, which helped him to achieve a balance between pure expression and gestural freedom. In 1962, he received a UNESCO scholarship to study in the United States, from where he visited South America. From 1964 to 1965, he returned to the US with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, and in 1966, he led the Sudanese delegation during the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar, Senegal.Ryle, John, Justin Willis, Suliman Baldo & Jok Madut Jok (eds), The Sudan Handbook, \\"Key Figures in Sudanese History, Culture & Politics\\", James Currey, 2011, p. 205. Culture Base (2003), biography In addition to representing Sudan in the World Festival of Black Arts, El-Salahi was part of the Sudanese delegation at the first Pan-African Cultural Festival in Algiers in 1969. Both of these events were important and significant in modern African art movements. After the completion of his education, he returned to Sudan. During this period, he used Arabic calligraphy and other elements of Islamic culture that played a role in his everyday life. Trying to connect to his heritage, El-Salahi began to fill his work with symbols and markings of small Arabic inscriptions. As he became more advanced with incorporating Arabic calligraphy into his work, the symbols began to produce animals, humans, and plant forms, providing new meaning to his artwork. El- Salahi learned to combine European artistic styles with traditional Sudanese themes, which resulted in an African-influenced kind of surrealism. From 1969 until 1972, El-Salahi was assistant cultural attaché at the Sudanese Embassy in London. After that, he returned to Sudan as Director of Culture in Jaafar Nimeiri's government, and then was Undersecretary in the Ministry of Culture and Information until September 1975. That year, he was imprisoned for six months and eight days without trial for being accused of participating in an anti-government coup. At the time of Ibrahim El-Salahi's period of incarceration, many intellectuals and some members of the Sudanese Communist Party were sent to prison. El-Salahi's freedom was stripped in Kober Prison in Khartoum; prisoners were not allowed to write or draw, and if a prisoner was to be caught with paper or pencil, he would be punished with solitary confinement for fifteen days. Despite of this, El-Salahi was able to find a pencil and often used the brown paper bags that food was distributed with to draw on. El-Salahi would tear the bag into numerous pieces and could use the 25 exercise minutes he received everyday to sketch out ideas for huge paintings. He would also secretly sketch and bury small drawings into the sand to maintain his ideas. El-Salahi was released on 16 March 1976, and did not keep any of the drawings he made in prison; he left them all buried. Next, he rented a house in the Banat region of Omdurman for a short period of time. Two years after his release from prison, he exiled himself from Sudan and for some years worked and lived in Doha, Qatar, before finally settling in Oxford, United Kingdom. According to an article in the academic journal African Arts, Ibrahim El-Salahi holds a strong faith in Islam and is a member of the Khatmyia Sufi order. He prays five times a day and also before he works on his artwork. Like other Sufis, El-Salahi views prayer as a way to establish a connection between the creator and the created. Artistic production El- Salahi is considered a pioneer in Sudanese modern art and was a member of the \\"Khartoum School\\", co-founded by el-Salahi.. Other members of this artistic movement in Sudan were poets, novelists, and literary critics of the \\"Desert School\\", that also sought to establish a new Sudanese cultural identity. One of the main areas of focus for the Khartoum School was to create a modern Sudanese aesthetic style and not relying heavily on Western influences. In the 1960s, he was briefly associated with the Mbari Club in Ibadan, Nigeria. In an interview with Sarah Dwider, a curator at the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, El-Salahi commented about his time spent in Nigeria and the impact it had on his work: \\"My short visit to Nigeria in the early 1960s gave me the chance to connect artistically with a dynamic part of the African continent, opening myself to influence and be influenced.\\" He began by exploring Coptic manuscripts which led him to experiment with Arabic calligraphy.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 155 Ultimately, he developed his own style and was among the early group of artists to elaborate Arabic calligraphy in his paintings, in a style that became known as Hurufiyya art movement. In an interview with The Guardian in 2013, he explained, how he came to use calligraphy in his artworks. Following his return to Sudan in 1957, he was disappointed at the poor attendance at his exhibitions and reflected on how to generate public interest: : \\"I organised an exhibition in Khartoum of still-lifes, portraits and nudes. People came to the opening just for the soft drinks. After that, no one came. [It was] as though it hadn't happened. I was completely stuck for two years. I kept asking myself why people couldn't accept and enjoy what I had done. [After reflecting on what would allow his work to resonate with people], I started to write small Arabic inscriptions in the corners of my paintings, almost like postage stamps, and people started to come towards me. I spread the words over the canvas, and they came a bit closer. Then I began to break down the letters to find what gave them meaning, and a Pandora's box opened. Animal forms, human forms and plant forms began to emerge from these once-abstract symbols. That was when I really started working. Images just came, as though I was doing it with a spirit I didn't know I had.\\" His work has developed through several phases. His first period during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s is dominated by elementary forms and lines. During the next two decade span, El-Salahi used more subtle, earthy tones in his color palette. In Ibrahim El-Salahi's own words: \\"I limited my color scheme to somber tones, using black, white, burnt sienna, and yellow ochre, which resembled the colors of earth and skin color shades of people in our part of the Sudan. Technically it added depth to the picture\\". The color selection that El-Salahi chose in this formative period in his artistry reflected the landscape of Sudan, trying to attempt to connect larger concerns of society, whilst creating a unique Sudanese aesthetic through his work. After this period, his work became meditative, abstract and organic, using new warm, brilliant colors and abstract human and non-human figures, rendered through geometric shapes. Most of his work has been characterized by lines, while he mainly uses white and black paint. In Sudan, artworks often include both Islamic calligraphy and African motifs, such as elongated mask shapes. Some of his works like \\"Allah and the Wall of Confrontation\\" (1968) and \\"The Last Sound\\"(1964) are both works that show elements characteristic of Islamic art, such as the shape of the crescent moon. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, El-Salahi lived in self exile in Qatar, where he focussed on drawing in black and white. Many of his admirers were unaware of his residence in Qatar,and El-Salahi found this distance to be \\"relieving\\", and he could use the time to become more experimental.  International recognition and major exhibitions  In 2001, Ibrahim el-Salahi was honored with a Prince Claus Award from the Netherlands.Ibrahim el-Salahi: a visionary modernist , Prince Claus Fund (2012).Profile , Prince Claus Fund. In the summer of 2013, a major retrospective exhibition of El-Salahi's work, comprising one hundred works, was presented at the Tate Modern, London, the Tate's first retrospective dedicated to an African artist. From November 2016 to January 2017, El-Salahi's work was featured prominently in the first comprehensive exhibition dedicated to the Modernist art movement in Sudan, entitled The Khartoum School: The Making of the Modern Art Movement in Sudan (1945 –present) at the Sharja Art Foundation. In 2018, the Ashmolean Museum in his adopted home in Oxford, United Kingdom, presented a solo exhibition of El- Salahi's work. This exhibition allowed the viewers to appreciate early works, as well as some of his more recent works. Moreover, the exhibition combined his works with ancient Sudanese objects from the museum's main collection as examples of traditional artworks. One of the key aspects of this exhibition was El-Salahi's use of the Haraz tree. The Haraz tree is a native acacia species found commonly in the Nile valley, that often symbolizes resilience in Sudan. El-Salahi created a series called \\"Trees\\", which consists of several works and is an important period in the artists career. As scholar Salah M. Hassan points out: \\"The Trees series has demonstrated not only El-Salahi’s ‘resilience and productivity’, it also reveals the artist’s ‘ability to reinvent himself while remaining on the forefront of exploration and creativity.\\" References See also  *Arabic calligraphy *Hurufiyya art movement *Osman Waqialla  External links  *Ibrahim El-Salahi on Google Art Project *Ibrahim El-Salahi, short biography, list of exhibitions and 14 artworks on artnet.com *Khartoum School, the Tate Gallery  \\"TateShots: Ibrahim El-Salahi's 'The Inevitable'\\", Tate, 25 July 2013. *Hassan Musa, \\"Stories from El-Salahi's garden - Ibrahim El-Salahi at Tate Modern\\", 16 July 2013.

Life Szávai was born in 1950 in Szeklerland. (Szeklerland is inhabited by Hungarians and is a specific, autonomous part of Transylvania, cradle of the history and culture of several nations – Romanians, Germans etc. –, now belonging to Romania.) Having taken a university degree, he taught for a short period of time, then worked as a journalist and editor. He has been living in Budapest from 1988. In 1994 he founded the PONT Publishing House, which publishes books (and periodicals) in several languages. He started an international program called CONFLUX (the opposite of conflict) together with his friends living in Europe and overseas. He writes prose and essays. His most known book, the Szekler Jerusalem is an exciting “essay-novel” containing historical documents, reflections, memoirs and personal confessions, presenting the tragic story of Hungarian Sabbatarians or “spiritual Jews”. Variety and experiment characterize his work as a novelist. The Past Millenium in Marienbad, a novel described as “monumental” by critics, discusses the personal and collective crises experienced in post-communist Hungary. His novel entitled Aletta’s Ark takes place in 17th century Japan and describes the massacre of Christians that occurred at this time Thoroughly enthralled by diversity’s possibilities, Szávai professes that each of his novels comprises a different genre. He believes a few pages can sufficiently convey the depth of an entire novel. In his series, Great Novels and Smaller Ones, he experiments with this unique technique to writing novels. The first volume in this series, Tracks in the Snow, was published in 2008. In an interview about his latest work, Carrying You to Lands of Wonder (2013), Szávai stated that, “It’s fashionable these days to refer to the phrase, ’world music.’ In my opinion, world novels are emerging from the same kinds of depths.” This work also brings world novels to the surface. As far as the author’s interpretation of “wonder” is concerned, he says the following: Works=Novels= * Séta gramofonzenére (Walking With the Music of a Gramophone; first edition: 1985, published also in German, Romanian and Russian, in preparation in Polish, Spanish and Czech) * Oszlik a bál (The Ball is Breaking Up; written in 1986, first edition: 1990, published also in Romanian, in preparation in German and Russian) * Utóvéd (Arriere-gard, first edition: 1987, in preparation in English) * Ki látott minket meztelenül?

Biography Drach came from an Alsatian family of peasants. Because of the Franco-Prussian war the parents fled with their children to Saint-Dié. He attended school there and in Nancy before he studied at the École Normale Supérieure (ENS). In 1892 he received his Agrégation and in 1898 he received at ENS his PhD under Paul Tannery with thesis Essai sur la théorie générale de l'intégration et sur la classification des transcendantes. In his thesis, Drach developed a Galois theory for differential equations, building upon the work of Émile Picard, Sophus Lie and Ernest Vessiot. After that he was Maître de Conférences at the University (Faculté des Sciences) in Clermont-Ferrand. Drach was successively a professor at Lille, Poitiers, and Toulouse, before he became in 1913 Professor for Anaytic Mechanics and Higher Analysis at the Sorbonne. During World War I he studied the mathematical theory of ballistics and published the results of his research around 1920. In retirement he moved to Cavalaire in southern France, where he had a country estate to which he frequently withdrew because of his health. He remained mathematically active in retirement. In addition to mathematical analysis and its applications to mechanics, Drach worked on number theory, partial differential equations, and differential geometry. In 1929 he was elected a member of the Académie des Sciences. Drach and his friend Émile Borel published, in 1892, their notes on lectures given by Henri Poincaré and, in 1895, their notes on lectures given by Paul Tannery. Drach was also a co- editor of the collected works of Poincaré. Drach was married to Mathilde Guitton. His son Pierre Drach was a noted biologist.

She has had a prolific career in film and television. Kim debuted in a talent contest in 1970, then shot to fame in Country Diaries. The landmark TV series aired for almost 20 years, making Kim one of the most popular Korean actresses of the 1980s. In 2003 she made a memorable cameo as a profanity-spouting ajumma in the Jang Nara comedy Oh! Happy Day. It successfully revamped her image and rejuvenated her fading career. Kim quickly became known in the Korean entertainment industry as the \\"Queen of Ad-lib,\\" with her comic talent showcased in many of her succeeding projects, notably Mapado, Twilight Gangsters, Granny's Got Talent (2015), and the Marrying the Mafia sequels. Kim also gained attention for her turns in more serious fare, such as 2006's Barefoot Ki-bong, a heartwarming pic about a developmentally disabled man. Her 2011 film Late Blossom is a romance between two elderly couples, a topic rarely explored in Korean cinema. The low-budget indie became a sleeper hit, and for her portrayal of an Alzheimer's-afflicted woman, Kim won Best Supporting Actress at the Blue Dragon Film Awards. Other activities In 1998, Kim's chauffeur-driven BMW shot backward, killing her mother-in-law. Kim filed a lawsuit against BMW, alleging that the sudden-start had been a car defect. The Seoul District Court ruled in the automaker's favor in 2003, saying that it was unclear whether the accident was caused by driver error or a sudden-start.

It is named after the Swiss mathematicians Armand Borel and Jean de Siebenthal who developed the theory in 1949. Each such subgroup is the identity component of the centralizer of its center. They can be described recursively in terms of the associated root system of the group. The subgroups for which the corresponding homogeneous space has an invariant complex structure correspond to parabolic subgroups in the complexification of the compact Lie group, a reductive algebraic group. Connected subgroups of maximal rank Let G be connected compact Lie group with maximal torus T. Hopf showed that the centralizer of a torus S ⊆ T is a connected closed subgroup containing T, so of maximal rank. Indeed, if x is in CG(S), there is a maximal torus containing both S and x and it is contained in CG(S). Borel and de Siebenthal proved that the connected closed subgroups of maximal rank are precisely the identity components of the centralizers of their centers. Their result relies on a fact from representation theory. The weights of an irreducible representation of a connected compact semisimple group K with highest weight λ can be easily described (without their multiplicities): they are precisely the saturation under the Weyl group of the dominant weights obtained by subtracting off a sum of simple roots from λ. In particular, if the irreducible representation is trivial on the center of K (a finite abelian group), 0 is a weight.See:   To prove the characterization of Borel and de Siebenthal, let H be a closed connected subgroup of G containing T with center Z. The identity component L of CG(Z) contains H. If it were strictly larger, the restriction of the adjoint representation of L to H would be trivial on Z. Any irreducible summand, orthogonal to the Lie algebra of H, would provide non-zero weight zero vectors for T / Z ⊆ H / Z, contradicting the maximality of the torus T / Z in L / Z. Maximal connected subgroups of maximal rank Borel and de Siebenthal classified the maximal closed connected subgroups of maximal rank of a connected compact Lie group. The general classification of connected closed subgroups of maximal rank can be reduced to this case, because any connected subgroup of maximal rank is contained in a finite chain of such subgroups, each maximal in the next one. Maximal subgroups are the identity components of any element of their center not belonging to the center of the whole group. The problem of determining the maximal connected subgroups of maximal rank can be further reduced to the case where the compact Lie group is simple. In fact the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} of a connected compact Lie group G splits as a direct sum of the ideals :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}=\\\\mathfrak{z} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_1\\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_m,} where \\\\mathfrak{z} is the center and the other factors \\\\mathfrak{g}_i are simple. If T is a maximal torus, its Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{t} has a corresponding splitting :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{t}=\\\\mathfrak{z} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{t}_1\\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{t}_m,} where \\\\mathfrak{t}_i is maximal abelian in \\\\mathfrak{g}_i. If H is a closed connected of G containing T with Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{h}, the complexification of \\\\mathfrak{h} is the direct sum of the complexification of \\\\mathfrak{t} and a number of one-dimensional weight spaces, each of which lies in the complexification of a factor \\\\mathfrak{g}_i. Thus if :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{h}_i=\\\\mathfrak{h}\\\\cap\\\\mathfrak{g}_i,} then :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{h}=\\\\mathfrak{z} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{h}_1\\\\oplus\\\\cdots \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{h}_m.} If H is maximal, all but one of the \\\\mathfrak{h}_i's coincide with \\\\mathfrak{g}_i and the remaining one is maximal and of maximal rank. For that factor, the closed connected subgroup of the corresponding simply connected simple compact Lie group is maximal and of maximal rank. Let G be a connected simply connected compact simple Lie group with maximal torus T. Let \\\\mathfrak{g} be the Lie algebra of G and \\\\mathfrak{t} that of T. Let Δ be the corresponding root system. Choose a set of positive roots and corresponding simple roots α1, ..., αn. Let α0 the highest root in \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\mathbf{C}} and write :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\alpha_0=m_1 \\\\alpha_1 + \\\\cdots + m_n\\\\alpha_n} with mi ≥ 1. (The number of mi equal to 1 is equal to |Z– 1, where Z is the center of G.) The Weyl alcove is defined by :\\\\displaystyle{A=\\\\\\\\{T\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{t}:\\\\, \\\\alpha_1(T)\\\\ge 0, \\\\dots,\\\\alpha_n(T)\\\\ge 0, \\\\alpha_0(T)\\\\le 1\\\\\\\\}.} Élie Cartan showed that it is a fundamental domain for the affine Weyl group. If G1 = G / Z and T1 = T / Z, it follows that the exponential mapping from \\\\mathfrak{g} to G1 carries 2πA onto T1. The Weyl alcove A is a simplex with vertices at :\\\\displaystyle{v_0=0,\\\\,\\\\, v_i=m_i^{-1} X_i,} where αi(Xj) = δij. The main result of Borel and de Siebenthal is as follows. Extended Dynkin diagrams for the simple complex Lie algebras The structure of the corresponding subgroup H1 can be described in both cases. It is semisimple in the second case with a system of simple roots obtained by replacing αi by −α0. In the first case it is the direct product of the circle group generated by Xi and a semisimple compact group with a system of simple roots obtained by omitting αi. This result can be rephrased in terms of the extended Dynkin diagram of \\\\mathfrak{g} which adds an extra node for the highest root as well as the labels mi. The maximal subalgebras \\\\mathfrak{h} of maximal rank are either non-semisimple or semimsimple. The non-semisimple ones are obtained by deleting two nodes from the extended diagram with coefficient one. The corresponding unlabelled diagram gives the Dynkin diagram semisimple part of \\\\mathfrak{h}, the other part being a one-dimensional factor. The Dynkin diagrams for the semisimple ones are obtained by removing one node with coefficient a prime. This leads to the following possibilities: * An: Ap × A n − p − 1 × T (non-semisimple) * Bn: Dn or Bp × Dn − p (semisimple), Bn − 1 × T (non-semisimple) * Cn: Cp × Cn − p (SS), An - 1 × T (NSS) * Dn: Dp × Dn - p (SS), Dn - 1 × T, An-1 × T (NSS) * E6: A1 × A5, A2 × A2 × A2 (SS), D5 × T (NSS) * E7: A1 × D6, A2 × A5, A7 (SS), E6 × T (NSS) * E8: D8, A8, A4 × A4, E6 × A2, E7 × A1 (SS) * F4: B4, A2 × A2, A1 × C3 (SS) * G2: A2, A1 × A1 (SS) All the corresponding homogeneous spaces are symmetric, since the subalgebra is the fixed point algebra of an inner automorphism of period 2, apart from G2/A2, F4/A2×A2, E6/A2×A2×A2, E7/A2×A5 and all the E8 spaces other than E8/D8 and E8/E7×A1. In all these exceptional cases the subalgebra is the fixed point algebra of an inner automorphism of period 3, except for E8/A4×A4 where the automorphism has period 5. To prove the theorem, note that H1 is the identity component of the centralizer of an element exp T with T in 2π A. Stabilizers increase in moving from a subsimplex to an edge or vertex, so T either lies on an edge or is a vertex. If it lies on an edge than that edge connects 0 to a vertex vi with mi = 1, which is the first case. If T is a vertex vi and mi has a non-trivial factor m, then mT has a larger stabilizer than T, contradicting maximality. So mi must be prime. Maximality can be checked directly using the fact that an intermediate subgroup K would have the same form, so that its center would be either (a) T or (b) an element of prime order. If the center of H1 is 'T, each simple root with mi prime is already a root of K, so (b) is not possible; and if (a) holds, αi is the only root that could be omitted with mj = 1, so K = H1. If the center of H1 is of prime order, αj is a root of K for mj = 1, so that (a) is not possible; if (b) holds, then the only possible omitted simple root is αi, so that K = H1.See:  Closed subsystems of roots A subset Δ1 ⊂ Δ is called a closed subsystem if whenever α and β lie in Δ1 with α + β in Δ, then α + β lies in Δ1. Two subsystems Δ1 and Δ2 are said to be equivalent if σ( Δ1) = Δ2 for some σ in W = NG(T) / T, the Weyl group. Thus for a closed subsystem :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{t}_{\\\\mathbf{C}} \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\alpha\\\\in \\\\Delta_1} \\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\alpha} is a subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\mathbf{C}} containing \\\\mathfrak{t}_{\\\\mathbf{C}}; and conversely any such subalgebra gives rise to a closed subsystem. Borel and de Siebenthal classified the maximal closed subsystems up to equivalence. This result is a consequence of the Borel–de Siebenthal theorem for maximal connected subgroups of maximal rank. It can also be proved directly within the theory of root systems and reflection groups. Applications to symmetric spaces of compact type Let G be a connected compact semisimple Lie group, σ an automorphism of G of period 2 and Gσ the fixed point subgroup of σ. Let K be a closed subgroup of G lying between Gσ and its identity component. The compact homogeneous space G / K is called a symmetric space of compact type. The Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} admits a decomposition :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}=\\\\mathfrak{k}\\\\oplus\\\\mathfrak{p},} where \\\\mathfrak{k}, the Lie algebra of K, is the +1 eigenspace of σ and \\\\mathfrak{p} the –1 eigenspace. If \\\\mathfrak{k} contains no simple summand of \\\\mathfrak{g}, the pair (\\\\mathfrak{g}, σ) is called an orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra of compact type. Any inner product on \\\\mathfrak{g}, invariant under the adjoint representation and σ, induces a Riemannian structure on G / K, with G acting by isometries. Under such an inner product, \\\\mathfrak{k} and \\\\mathfrak{p} are orthogonal. G / K is then a Riemannian symmetric space of compact type.See:  The symmetric space or the pair (\\\\mathfrak{g}, σ) is said to be irreducible if the adjoint action of \\\\mathfrak{k} (or equivalently the identity component of Gσ or K) is irreducible on \\\\mathfrak{p}. This is equivalent to the maximality of \\\\mathfrak{k} as a subalgebra.See:  In fact there is a one-one correspondence between intermediate subalgebras \\\\mathfrak{h} and K-invariant subspaces \\\\mathfrak{p}_1 of \\\\mathfrak{p} given by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{h}=\\\\mathfrak{k}\\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{p}_1,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\ \\\\mathfrak{p}_1=\\\\mathfrak{h}\\\\cap \\\\mathfrak{p}.} Any orthogonal symmetric algebra (\\\\mathfrak{g}, σ) can be decomposed as an (orthogonal) direct sum of irreducible orthogonal symmetric algebras.See:  In fact \\\\mathfrak{g} can be written as a direct sum of simple algebras :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}=\\\\oplus_{i=1}^N \\\\mathfrak{g}_i,} which are permuted by the automorphism σ. If σ leaves an algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}_1 invariant, its eigenspace decomposition coincides with its intersections with \\\\mathfrak{k} and \\\\mathfrak{p}. So the restriction of σ to \\\\mathfrak{g}_1 is irreducible. If σ interchanges two simple summands, the corresponding pair is isomorphic to a diagonal inclusion of K in K × K, with K simple, so is also irreducible. The involution σ just swaps the two factors σ(x,y)=(y,x). This decomposition of an orthogonal symmetric algebra yields a direct product decomposition of the corresponding compact symmetric space G / K when G is simply connected. In this case the fixed point subgroup Gσ is automatically connected (this is no longer true, even for inner involutions, if G is not simply connected). For simply connected G, the symmetric space G / K is the direct product of the two kinds of symmetric spaces Gi / Ki or H × H / H. Non-simply connected symmetric space of compact type arise as quotients of the simply connected space G / K by finite abelian groups. In fact if :\\\\displaystyle{G/K=G_1/K_1\\\\times \\\\cdots\\\\times G_s/K_s,} let :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Gamma_i=Z(G_i)/Z(G_i)\\\\cap K_i} and let Δi be the subgroup of Γi fixed by all automorphisms of Gi preserving Ki (i.e. automorphisms of the orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra). Then :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Delta=\\\\Delta_1\\\\times \\\\cdots\\\\times\\\\Delta_s} is a finite abelian group acting freely on G / K. The non-simply connected symmetric spaces arise as quotients by subgroups of Δ. The subgroup can be identified with the fundamental group, which is thus a finite abelian group.See:  The classification of compact symmetric spaces or pairs (\\\\mathfrak{g}, σ) thus reduces to the case where G is a connected simple compact Lie group. There are two possibilities: either the automorphism σ is inner, in which case K has maximal rank and the theory of Borel and de Siebenthal applies; or the automorphism σ is outer, so that, because σ preserves a maximal torus, the rank of K is less than the rank of G and σ corresponds to an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram modulo inner automorphisms. determines directly all possible σ in the latter case: they correspond to the symmetric spaces SU(n)/SO(n), SO(a+b)/SO(a)×SO(b) (a and b odd), E6/F4 and E6/C4. Victor Kac noticed that all finite order automorphisms of a simple Lie algebra can be determined using the corresponding affine Lie algebra: that classification, which leads to an alternative method of classifying pairs (\\\\mathfrak{g}, σ), is described in . Applications to hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type The equal rank case with K non-semisimple corresponds exactly to the Hermitian symmetric spaces G / K of compact type. In fact the symmetric space has an almost complex structure preserving the Riemannian metric if and only if there is a linear map J with J2 = −I on \\\\mathfrak{p} which preserves the inner product and commutes with the action of K. In this case J lies in \\\\mathfrak{k} and exp Jt forms a one-parameter group in the center of K. This follows because if A, B, C, D lie in \\\\mathfrak{p}, then by the invariance of the inner product on \\\\mathfrak{g} :\\\\displaystyle{( A,B],C],D)=([A,B],[C,D])=( C,D],B],A).} Replacing A and B by JA and JB, it follows that :\\\\displaystyle{[JA,JB] = [A,B].} Define a linear map δ on \\\\mathfrak{g} by extending J to be 0 on \\\\mathfrak{k}. The last relation shows that δ is a derivation of \\\\mathfrak{g}. Since \\\\mathfrak{g} is semisimple, δ must be an inner derivation, so that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\delta(X)=[T + A,X],} with T in \\\\mathfrak{k} and A in \\\\mathfrak{p}. Taking X in \\\\mathfrak{k}, it follows that A = 0 and T lies in the center of \\\\mathfrak{k} and hence that K is non-semisimple. If on the other hand G / K is irreducible with K non-semisimple, the compact group G must be simple and K of maximal rank. From the theorem of Borel and de Siebenthal, the involution σ is inner and K is the centralizer of a torus S. It follows that G / K is simply connected and there is a parabolic subgroup P in the complexification GC of G such that G / K = GC / P. In particular there is a complex structure on G / K and the action of G is holomorphic. In general any compact hermitian symmetric space is simply connected and can be written as a direct product of irreducible hermitian symmetric spaces Gi / Ki with Gi simple. The irreducible ones are exactly the non-semisimple cases described above.

He was knighted in 1971 for his work in the diplomatic service. In 1981 he was named in the House of Commons as a paedophile by Geoffrey Dickens MP. Early and personal life Hayman was born in Deal, England, the son of Hilda (Waite-Browne) and Charles Henry Telford Hayman.http://www.thepeerage.com/p16476.htm#i164752 He was educated at Stowe School and Worcester College, Oxford. He married Rosemary Eardley Blomefield in 1942, and had a son and a daughter. Career In November 1937 he joined the Home Office as an Assistant Principal. In World War II he served in the Rifle Brigade from 1942 to 1945, rising to the rank of Major. Hayman was director general of the British Information Services in New York (1961–64) and then deputy commandant of the British military government in West Berlin from 1964 to 1966. He returned to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, becoming Deputy Under Secretary of State with responsibility for the United Nations and Eastern Europe from 1969 to 1970. Then, from 1970 to 1974, he served as High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Canada. The Independent stated in his obituary that he started a commercial career in 1974, upon retirement at age 60. However The Guardian reported in 2014 that he later served in the intelligence services, and was \\"long-time deputy director of MI6\\". The Daily Telegraph characterised him as an \\"MI6 operative\\". His obituary in The Independent gave his career history as: *Assistant Principal Home Office 1937–39 *Ministry of Home Security 1939–41 *Assistant Private Secretary to Home Secretary 1941–42 *Principal Home Office 1942, 1945–49 *Personal Assistant to Chief Staff Officer to the Minister MOD 1949–52 *Assistant Secretary MOD 1950 *UK Delegation to NATO 1952–54 *Foreign Office 1954 *Counsellor Belgrade 1955–58 *Assignment to Malta 1958 *Counsellor Baghdad 1959–61 *Director General of British Information Services New York 1961–64 *Minister and Deputy Commandant British Military Government in Berlin 1964–66 *Assistant Undersecretary FO 1966–69 *Deputy Under Secretary of State FCO 1969–70 *High Commissioner in Canada 1970–74 Paedophilia In October 1978, Hayman left a package of paedophilia-related material on a London bus. The police traced the package and discovered that Hayman, under the pseudonym \\"Peter Henderson\\", had used an apartment in Bayswater, London, to conduct obscene correspondence. In the apartment, police found 45 diaries describing six years of \\"sexual fantasies\\" concerning children and activities with prostitutes, articles of female clothing and obscene literature. He was investigated by police but released without charge after being given a warning not to send obscene material through the post. In November 1980, Private Eye magazine revealed this event.Part 1, Part 2. (Private Eye newspaper clippings) In 1981, using parliamentary privilege, MP Geoffrey Dickens asked why Hayman had not been prosecuted, with Dickens saying: \\"How did such a potential blackmail risk come to hold highly sensitive posts at the MOD and NATO?\\" He also asked the Leader of the House of Commons to \\"investigate the security implications of diaries found in the diplomat's London flat which contained accounts of sexual exploits\\". In 1981, the Attorney General Sir Michael Havers replied, \\"I am in agreement with the Director of Public Prosecutions' (Sir Thomas Chalmers Hetherington QC) advice not to prosecute Sir Peter Hayman and the other persons with whom he had carried on an obscene correspondence\\" adding that, while Hayman had been found to have received pornographic material through the post, it was not of an extreme nature, was non-commercial and in a sealed envelope, so did not warrant prosecution. There was much debate and condemnation in the international press of these events. Havers said in parliament that, while Hayman was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange, he was never a member of the executive committee, so was not prosecuted as others were for publishing contact advertisements. In 1984, Hayman was convicted and fined for an act of gross indecency with another adult in a public lavatory. The Prime Minister warned Hayman that, should he be known to repeat the offence, he would be stripped of his honours. On 29 November 1985, Dickens complained in the House of Commons that he had suffered harassment following his naming of Hayman. \\"The noose around my neck grew tighter after I named a former high-flying British diplomat on the Floor of the House.

History Introduced in 1953, the Settebello (Italian: Il Settebello) provided high-speed luxury train service between Milan and Rome. Its name translates as \\"the beautiful seven\\" (or alternatively and more loosely as \\"the lucky seven\\") and was based on a popular Italian card game known as Scopone, in which the seven-of- diamonds card carries the highest value. A drawing of nine playing cards, with the seven-of-diamonds card shown larger than all of the others, was painted on the side of the train next to its name. For its entire history Il Settebello was operated by electric multiple-unit trainsets of type ETR 300, and these sets consequently came to be known as \\"Settebello\\" type, as they were used exclusively on the Settebello during its period of operation. These trainsets featured rounded ends with passenger observation lounges, allowing passengers to sit at the very front and rear of the train. The operator's cab – or \\"command cabin\\" – was in a raised area behind and above the lounge compartment. The design made the train distinct from all other trains in Italy and all other high-speed trains of the time.

In addition to the regular first-class ticket price, the cost of travelling on the luxury train Settebello carried an extra surcharge, or fare supplement. The surcharge alone was almost as much as the first-class fare, but afforded passengers a service \\"comparable to that of a five-star hotel\\", with amenities found on very few other day-journey trains of the time. These included an office where a traveller could \\"make a telephone call to anywhere in Italy\\" and the availability of shower facilities in the restrooms.

During its pre-TEE years, the Settebello had been an evening or midday service, departing Milan at 5:45 p.m. and Rome around 10:30 a.m., and the Milan–Rome trips at those times of day were taken over by a different TEE, the Ambrosiano, upon the Settebellos designation as a TEE.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. History Seitz's Tavern on West Middle St. The land where the village of Chelsea now sits was first settled in the 1830s by brothers Elisha and James Congdon. In 1848, the Congdons offered the Michigan Central Railroad a plot of land along the rail line on which to build a station. The railroad accepted, and the first structure built at the site was a freight station, completed in 1850. The Congdons platted the village of Chelsea in the fall of that year, and the first public buildings - a blacksmith shop and a hotel - were built soon after. A series of freight stations was built on the site, and the resulting freight business through the town spurred the growth of Chelsea in the mid-1800s. Additional schools, churches, and businesses were built in the area around the depot in the 1850s and 1860s. As the village grew, a thriving commercial district sprang up south of the railroad tracks. The early buildings were wooden, but after a series of disastrous fires in the 1870s, the current brick structures were built. Historical district description The Chelsea Commercial Historic District begins on the north side of Main Street at the Michigan Central Railroad tracks and the Glazier Stoveworks, and continues southward. to include the bulk of the historic downtown area of the village. The district is primarily commercial in nature, but also includes public and religious buildings and a few private homes.

The prominent clocktower, originally designed as an architectural feature to hold the building's industrial water tower, is one of the most visible landmarks in the city. The Glazier Stove Company was owned by Frank Porter Glazier, who guided the company to become a large and profitable firm in the construction of stoves. He hired Ionia, Michigan architect Caire Allen to design this building. However, the company and Glazier went bankrupt in 1907, in large part due to questionable financial dealings on Glazier's part, for which he was convicted of three counts of embezzlement in 1908.

The station was built in 1880, when the railroad decided to establish passenger service in Chelsea. The railroad commissioned Detroit architects Mason and Rice to design the new station, and it served as a Michigan Central Railroad passenger station until 1975, when the company went out of business. Amtrak took over the line and continued service until 1981, when the station was closed. For the next few years, the station was used for storage. In 1985, a group of Chelsea citizens formed the Chelsea Depot Association and purchased the depot to prevent the deterioration of the structure. They began restoration efforts in 1986, and the depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

The congregation grew through the next century, and wings were added to the building in 1963 and 1996. The building continues to be used by the church. =McKune Memorial Library= McKune House Hotel, c. 1874 The McKune Memorial Library, also known as the McKune House, is a public building located at 221 Shouth Main Street. Elisha Congdon was one of Chelsea's first residents, arriving in 1832. He built a log house on this spot at that time; the log house burned down in 1849, and Congdon replaced it with a frame structure. In 1860, he moved the frame house and built this brick structure in its place. Congdon lived in the house until he died in 1867. In 1870, businessman Timothy McKune purchased the house and converted it into a hotel called the \\"McKune House Hotel.\\" McKune's son Edward took over the property in 1909, but as the 20th century progressed, the hotel saw less business, and turned into more of a rooming house. In the 1940s, the Friends of the Chelsea Library was organized, and they began looking for a suitable home for the library. They approached Edward McKune's widow, Katherine Staffan McKune; in 1956 she offered to give the McKune house to the library upon her death. That occurred two years later, in 1958. The Friends of the Chelsea Library did extensive renovation work, and in 1959 the library opened. A wing was added in 1961. The front porch was reconstructed to replicate the original porch in 1995. In 2004, the original building was again renovated, and another wing was constructed.

In May 1847 Edmund Stirling acquired The Inquirer from Francis Lochée, who established the paper in August 1840 together with William Tanner. Tanner disposed of his interest in the paper in June 1843. In July 1855, The Inquirer merged with The Commercial News and Shipping Gazette, which was owned by Robert John Sholl, to form The Inquirer & Commercial News, in the joint ownership of Sholl and Stirling. Stirling's eldest son John joined the paper around 1863 and operated the paper with his father when Sholl left. In 1878 Stirling's three other sons Horace, Frederick and Baldwin joined the paper, trading as Stirling & Sons. When Stirling retired his three sons took control of the paper as Stirling Bros. On 6 July 1886 it incorporated the Morning Herald. On 17 February 1893 the paper changed format and became the Inquirer and Commercial News Illustrated until 28 December 1894, when it reverted to The Inquirer & Commercial News. In the 1880s in the Daily News traced its history to the establishment of The Inquirer.

Introduced in 1971, it was operated by the Deutsche Bundesbahn / Deutsche Bahn (DB) and the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). The train was named after Prince Eugene of Savoy, who was one of the most successful military commanders in modern European history, rising to the highest offices of state at the Imperial court in Vienna. History Over the years, the northern terminus, route, classification and formation (consist) of the Prinz Eugen varied significantly. However, the route always included the main line between Würzburg Hbf, in Germany, and Wien Westbf, in Vienna, via Passau Hbf, on the border between Germany and Austria. During the train's time as a Trans Europ Express (TEE), its route was originally Bremen – Würzburg – Nuremberg – Vienna, but in 1976 was altered to Hannover – Cologne – Frankfurt – Würzburg – Nuremberg – Vienna. It was the only TEE route ever to serve Vienna. In the 1970s, it was one of just three TEEs to run within Austria, the others being the Mediolanum and the Blauer Enzian,Nock, O.S. (1978). \\"Trans- Europe Expresses\\", in World Atlas of Railways, pp. 86–87. New York: Mayflower Books (original publisher: Artists House, London, UK). . but later, a short- lived, summer-only branch of the TEE Rheingold terminated in Salzburg, in 1985 and 1986 only. The Prinz Eugen final day as a TEE was 27 May 1978, and on the following day it was reclassified as a two-class InterCity (IC).Thomas Cook International Timetable (August 1978 edition), p. 74. Peterborough, UK: Thomas Cook Publishing. This train, which initially kept the same route, was first- class-only between Hannover and Frankfurt, and carried both first- and second- class cars between Frankfurt and Vienna. On 1 June 1980, the route of the IC Prinz Eugen was changed to Hamburg – Würzburg – Nuremberg – Vienna.Thomas Cook International Timetable (March 1–April 5, 1980 edition), pp. 107, 589. This was almost identical to the train's 1971–1976 route, except north of Hannover, where the route now ran to/from Hamburg instead of Bremen. On 31 May 1987, the Prinz Eugen was included in the then-newly introduced EuroCity (EC) network.Thomas Cook Continental Timetable (May 1–30, 1987 edition), pp. 67, 472–473. Its route remained unchanged until 2 June 1991, when it again returned to a routing via Cologne and Frankfurt, now running Hamburg – Bremen – Cologne – Frankfurt – Würzburg – Nuremberg – Vienna.Thomas Cook European Timetable (April 1991 edition), pp. 90, 516–519. On 24 May 1998, the Prinz Eugen became an Intercity-Express (ICE) train, still connecting Hamburg with Vienna but reverting again to a more direct routing, Hamburg – Hannover – Würzburg – Nuremberg – Vienna.\\"Summer services from May 24\\".

The line passed through Alipurduar. It was converted to metre gauge in 1910. With the partition of India in 1947, railway links of Assam and the Indian part of North Bengal, earlier passing through the eastern part of Bengal, were completely cut off from the rest of India. The Assam Rail Link project was taken up on 26 January 1948 to construct a metre-gauge railway linking Fakiragram with Kishanganj in Bihar via Alipurduar. The first train ran on the route on 26 January 1950. The route was converted to broad gauge in 2003–2006. Now all the railway tracks in Alipurduar city are broad gauge. Other adjacent stations Two adjacent local railway stations are Alipurduar (station code APD) and Alipurduar Court (station code APDC). Long-distance trains do not stop there. Most of the long-distance trains from other parts of India pass through and stop at New Alipurdur railway junction (station code NOQ) constructed in early 1950s as it is connected with double track to Assam and the rest of Bengal. The older Alipurduar station was on metre-gauge track that was converted to broad gauge much later in 2006 and fewer trains pass through Alipurduar station. The two junctions are on different lines and only one short-distance train Alipurduar-Kamakhya InterCity Express (train number 15471) runs between the two junctions. Northeast Frontier Railway converted the Alipurduar–Bamanhat branch line to broad gauge in 2007.

The Temperance movement in the United States is a movement to curb the consumption of alcohol. It had a large influence on American politics and American society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, culminating in the unsuccessful prohibition of alcohol, through the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, from 1920 to 1933. Today, there are organizations that continue to promote the cause of temperance.  Early temperance: 1784–1861  An early allegorical map of temperance by John C. Wiltberger, Jr., 1838. An allegorical map on temperance, based on the notion of alcohol as a train ride to destruction, the \\"Black Valley Rail Road\\" by the Massachusetts Temperance Alliance, 1863. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, various factors contributed to an epidemic of alcoholism that went hand-in-hand with spousal abuse, family neglect, and chronic unemployment. Americans who used to drink lightly alcoholic beverages, like cider \\"from the crack of dawn to the crack of dawn\\" began ingesting far more alcohol as they drank more of strong, cheap beverages like rum (in the colonial period) and whiskey (in the post-Revolutionary period). Popular pressure for cheap and plentiful alcohol led to relaxed ordinances on alcohol sales. The temperance movement was born with Benjamin Rush's 1784 tract, An Inquiry Into the Effects of Ardent Spirits Upon the Human Body and Mind, which judged the excessive use of alcohol injurious to physical and psychological health. Apparently influenced by Dr. Rush's Inquiry, about 200 farmers in a Connecticut community formed a temperance association in 1789 to ban the making of whiskey. Similar associations were formed in Virginia in 1800, and New York State in 1808. Over the next decade, other temperance organizations were formed in eight states, some being statewide organizations. The young movement allowed for temperate or moderate drinking. Many leaders of the movement expanded their activities and took positions on observance of the Sabbath and other moral issues, and by the early 1820s political in-fighting had stalled the movement. Some leaders persevered in pressing their cause forward. Americans such as Lyman Beecher, who was a Connecticut minister, had started to lecture his fellow citizens against all use of liquor in 1825. The American Temperance Society was formed in 1826 and benefited from a renewed interest in religion and morality. Within 12 years it claimed more than 8,000 local groups and over 1,250,000 members. By 1839, 18 temperance journals were being published. Simultaneously, some Protestant and Catholic church leaders were beginning to promote temperance. The movement split along two lines in the late 1830s: between moderates allowing some drinking and radicals demanding total abstinence, and between voluntarists relying on moral suasion alone and prohibitionists promoting laws to restrict or ban alcohol. Radicals and prohibitionists dominated many of the largest temperance organizations after the 1830s, and temperance eventually became synonymous with prohibition. In 1838, temperance activists pushed the Massachusetts legislature to pass a law restricting the sale of alcohol in quantities less than fifteen gallons. In the 1840s, numerous states passed laws allowing local voters to determine whether or not liquor licences would be issued in their towns or counties. In the 1850s, 13 states and territories passed statewide prohibitory laws (known as \\"Maine Laws\\"). Throughout this period, temperance reformers also tended to support Sunday laws that restricted the sale of alcohol on Sundays. The Civil War dealt the movement a crippling blow. Temperance groups in the South were then weaker than their Northern counterparts and too voluntarist to gain any statewide prohibition law, and the few prohibition laws in the North were repealed by the war's end. Both sides in the war made alcohol sales a part of the war effort by taxing brewers and distillers to finance much of the conflict. The issue of slavery crowded out temperance and temperance groups petered out until they found new life in the 1870s. =Temperance theatre= Temperance birthed an entire genre of theatre. In 1825, a dramatic poem called The Forgers premiered at the Charleston Theatre in Charleston, South Carolina. The next significant temperance drama to debut was titled \\"Fifteen Years of a Drunkard's Life\\", written by Douglas Jerrold in 1841. As the movement began to grow and prosper, these dramas became more popular among the general public. The Drunkard by W.H. Smith premiered in 1841 in Boston, running for 144 performances before being produced at Barnum's American Museum on lower Broadway. The play was wildly popular and is often credited with the entrance of the temperance narrative into mainstream American theatre. It continued to be a staple of New York's theatre scene all the way until 1875. The Drunkard follows the typical format of a temperance drama: the main character has an alcohol-induced downfall, and he restores his life from disarray once he denounces drinking for good at the play's end. Temperance drama continued to grow as a genre of theatre, fostered by the advent of the railroad as a form of transportation. This enabled theatre companies to be much more mobile, traveling from city to city. Temperance drama would even reach as far as the West Coast, as David Belasco's adaptation of Émile Zola's novel Drink premiered at the Baldwin Theatre in San Francisco in 1879. The image titled The Drunkard's Progress, shown in the top of the article, gives us a representation of the temperance movement. This image depicts the progress of a drunk man, slowly the woman disappears, and the mans night ends in death. This picture shows us that drinking is social but also brings poverty upon people, as well as death and loneliness. =Early victories in Maine= Maine was an early hotbed of the temperance movement. The world's first Total Abstinence Society was formed in Portland in 1815, and a statewide temperance group formed in 1834. These groups won a major victory in 1838 when they pressured the state legislature to pass the Fifteen Gallon Law, which prohibited the sale of spirits in quantities of less than that amount. Its practical effect was to make hard liquor available to the wealthy, who were the only ones who could afford such quantities. It was repealed within two years. However, in 1851 the so-called Maine law passed, which banned the production and sale of alcoholic beverages. Thus Maine became the first \\"dry\\" state. However, the law's exception for \\"medicinal, mechanical and manufacturing purposes\\" meant that liquor was still available for some.  Second Wave Temperance: 1872–1893  As Reconstruction came to a close in the 1870s, most white reformers grew uninterested in racial equality and invested more energy into temperance.Smith (2001), Grant, p. 547 This period produced various temperance organizations including the prohibitionist Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU, f. 1874) and the voluntarist Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America (CTAU, f. 1872). Prohibitionist temperance grew popular in the South as it embraced the \\"Southern\\" values of racial hierarchy, gender roles, and honor. The national movement enlisted more religious support throughout the country, especially from evangelicals. =Temperance education= In 1873, the WCTU established a Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction in Schools and Colleges, with Mary Hunt as National Superintendent. The WCTU was an influential organization with a membership of 120,000 by 1879. Frances Willard led the group under the motto \\"Do Everything\\" to protect women and children. Some of the changes the WCTU sought included property and custody rights for women, women's suffrage, raising the age of consensual sex, peace arbitration, women's education, and advocacy for working rights of women.Howard Clark Kee, Emily Albu, Carter Lindberg, J. William Frost, Dana L. Robert (1998). Christianity: A Social and Cultural History. 2nd edition. Prentice Hall, River, NJ. Postcard depicting Temperance Hall Because of the correlation between drinking and domestic violence—many drunken husbands abused family members—the temperance movement existed alongside various women's rights and other movements, including the Progressive movement, and often the same activists were involved in multiple movements. Many notable voices of the time, ranging from Lucy Webb Hayes to Susan B. Anthony, were active in temperance. In Canada, Nellie McClung was a longstanding advocate of temperance. As with most social movements, there was a gamut of activists running from violent (Carrie Nation) to mild (Neal S. Dow). The American Temperance University opened in 1893 in the planned town of Harriman, Tennessee, which was developed as a community with no alcoholic beverages permitted. In its second year of operation the institution enrolled 345 students from 20 states. However, it closed in 1908. =Temperance fountains= Muddied and ill-tasting drinking water encouraged many Americans to drink alcohol for health purposes, so temperance groups constructed public drinking fountains throughout the United States following the Civil War. The National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (NWCTU)'s organizing convention of 1874 strongly encouraged its attendees to erect the fountains in the places that they had come from. The NWCTU advocated public temperance fountains as a means to discourage males from entering drinking establishment for refreshment. Cast-stone statues of Hebe were marketed for use in temperance fountains. In Union Square Park{ (New York City) the James Fountain (1881), is a Temperance fountain with the figure of Charity who empties her jug of water, aided by a child; it was donated by Daniel Willis James and sculpted by Adolf Donndorf. In Washington DC \\"the\\" Temperance Fountain was donated to the city in 1882 by Temperance crusader Henry D. Cogswell. This fountain was one of a series of fountains he designed and commissioned in a belief that easy access to cool drinking water would keep people from consuming alcohol. Under its stone canopy the words \\"Faith,\\" \\"Hope,\\" \\"Charity,\\" and \\"Temperance\\" are chiseled. Atop this canopy is a life-sized heron, and the centerpiece is a pair of entwined heraldic scaly dolphins. Originally, visitors were supposed to freely drink ice water flowing from the dolphins' snouts with a brass cup attached to the fountain and the overflow was collected by a trough for horses, but the city tired of having to replenish the ice in a reservoir underneath the base and disconnected the supply pipes. Other Cogswell fountains include one still standing in New York City's Tompkins Square Park. Simon Benson, an Oregon lumberman, was a tee-totaler who wanted to discourage his workers from drinking alcohol in the middle of the day. In 1912, Benson gave the City of Portland USD$10,000 for the installation of twenty bronze drinking fountains. As of May 2012, these fountains, known as \\"Benson Bubblers\\", continue to be used as functional public drinking devices in downtown Portland; two Portland \\"Benson Bubbler\\" locations are Eastbank Esplanade and the corner of \\"3rd and Burnside\\".  Third wave temperance: 1893–1933  The last wave of temperance in the United States saw the rise of the Anti-Saloon League (ASL), which successfully pushed for National Prohibition from its enactment in 1920 to its repeal in 1933. This heavily prohibitionist wave attracted a diverse coalition: doctors, pastors, and eugenicists; Klansmen and liberal internationalists; business leaders and labor radicals; conservative evangelicals and liberal theologians.\\"A Nation of Drunkards.\\" Prohibition. Produced by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick. 2 hours. PBS video, DVD, 2011. = Anti-Saloon League = Rev. Howard Hyde Russell founded the Anti-Saloon League (ASL) in 1893. Under the leadership of Wayne Wheeler the ASL stressed political results and perfected the art of pressure politics. It did not demand that politicians change their drinking habits, only their votes in the legislature. Other organizations like the Prohibition Party and the WCTU soon lost influence to the better-organized and more focused ASL. The ASL's motto was \\"the Church in action against the saloon,\\" and it mobilized its religious coalition to pass state (and local) legislation (establishing dry states and dry counties). By the late nineteenth century, most Protestant denominations and the American wing of the Catholic Church supported the movement to legally restrict the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. These groups believed that alcohol consumption led to corruption, prostitution, spousal abuse, and other criminal activities. Brewers and distillers resisted the reform movement, which threatened to ruin their livelihoods, and also feared women having the vote, because they expected women to vote for prohibition. Energized by the anti-German sentiment during World War I, the ASL achieved its main goal of passage on December 18, 1917—the 18th Amendment. Upon ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures by January 16, 1919, established National Prohibition. The Amendment took effect on January 16, 1920. Prohibition banned \\"the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages in the United States and its possessions.\\" However, Prohibition did not outlaw the private possession or consumption of alcohol products. A temperance fountain in Tompkins Square Park, New York City  Modern temperance: Post-World War II  Harvard Medical School professors Jack Harold Mendelson and Nancy K Mello write, with regard to temperance sentiment in contemporary America, that \\"rallying cries once structured in terms of social order, home and basic decency are now framed in terms of health promotion and disease prevention.\\" Original temperance organizations such as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and International Organization of Good Templars continue their work today, while new \\"temperance enterprises found support in a variety of institutional venues\\" such as the Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems and Center for Science in the Public Interest. These temperance organizations focus their efforts on \\"promoting increased taxation, reducing alcohol advertising, and monitoring of the beverage industry\\", as well as the supporting of Sunday blue laws, which prohibit the sale of alcohol on Sundays. Temperance organizations Temperance organizations of the United States played an essential role in bringing about ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution establishing national prohibition of alcohol. Some temperance organizations in the United States include: * The American Issue Publishing House * The American Temperance Society * The Anti-Saloon League (active) * The British Women's Temperance Association (active) * The Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America * The Center for Science in the Public Interest (active) * The Committee of Fifty (1893) * The Daughters of Temperance * The Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction * The Flying Squadron of America * The IOGT- USA (active) * The Knights of Father Matthew * The Lincoln-Lee Legion * The Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems (active) * The Methodist Board of Temperance, Prohibition, and Public Morals * The National Temperance Society and Publishing House * The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association (active) * The Prohibition Party (active) * The Salvation Army (active) * The Scientific Temperance Federation * The Sons of Temperance (active) * The Templars of Honor and Temperance (active) * The Abstinence Society * The Total Abstinence Society, formed in Portland, Maine in 1815. * The Woman's Christian Temperance Union (active) * The Woman's New York State Temperance Society, founded in 1852 by Susan B. Anthony and Mary C. Vaughn * The National Temperance Council * The World League Against Alcoholism (a pro-prohibition organization) There was often considerable overlap in membership in these organizations, as well as in leadership. Prominent temperance leaders in the United States included Bishop James Cannon, Jr., James Black, Ernest Cherrington, Neal S. Dow, Mary Hunt, William E. Johnson (known as \\"Pussyfoot\\" Johnson), Carrie Nation, Howard Hyde Russell, John St. John, Billy Sunday, Father Mathew, Andrew Volstead and Wayne Wheeler. There were also commercial establishments, such as the Glenwood Inn (Hornellsville, New York), that made a point of selling no alcohol so as to attract families.

Later, he expanded his business with establishments in Uganda and Tanzania. He published a great number of educational and cultural books that have had a major importance in eastern Africa. For instance, he published the school books for primary and tertiary education that signified an important renewal in view of the subjects that were written from an African perspective. Previously, school books had been influenced greatly by a Western viewpoint. Also in the cultural field, Chakava came with innovating publications. Besides books in the English language, he published in local languages, at a time when local languages were still seen by governments and authorities as state subversive. Furthermore he published books with a critic stance on local governments. Challenging the boundaries of the freedom of expression, he took great risks and in fact, was repeatedly threatened. Moreover, he took the lead over the African Publishing Institute, and maintained contacts with important publishers in Oxford, England, such as the African Books Collective and Bellagio Publishing Network.

From its northern side, Infernetto is connected through Cristoforo Colombo road to the rest of the city. History In Roman times, it was a large cultivated area; however, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire the land was abandoned, becoming a wetland and a malaric zone. Starting from the Middle Ages the area was inhabited by a few people that lived in thatched huts from a group of hunters or lumberjacks, and people making coal by burning the wood from the local forest in a stack covered by 40 cm of soil. Soon the coal from wood become the first economy in the zone to sell in Rome: the name \\"Infernetto\\" (Italian for \\"Small hell\\") derives directly from this activity, because during the 18th and 19th century one could see a big column of dark smoke in the sky, sometimes even from the center of Rome, made from the coal production. During the Fascist age the Infernetto area was drained, and started growing up as a farm town. In the 1970s, it started to growing up as an illegal residential area, and many people built up houses without government license and without any urbanistic plan.

She contributed significantly to the development of plastic surgery between the 1940s and 1980s, and was named the American Association of Plastic Surgeons' 1977 Woman of the Year. Biography Stephenson was born Kathryn Lyle in 1912 in Kansas City, Missouri. She grew up in Kansas City, where she graduated from the Sunset Hill School in 1930. After briefly attending the University of Nebraska, she received her bachelor's degree from the University of Arizona in 1936. She was active in the Pi Beta Phi sorority at both schools. After college, she enrolled at the University of Kansas School of Medicine, where she received her M.D. in 1941. Stephenson interned at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in 1942-43, after which she was an assistant resident at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, and then a resident in pediatrics at the University of Kansas. At Kansas, she began her work in plastic surgery as the Earl C. Padgett Research Fellow in Plastic Surgery in 1944. In 1947, she was appointed an instructor in Plastic Surgery at Tulane University School of Medicine. In 1949, Stephenson moved back to Santa Barbara and established a private practice; she remained there for the rest of her career. While in private practice in Santa Barbara, she also was on the staff of the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, the Santa Barbara General Hospital, and St. Francis Hospital. The American Board of Plastic Surgery certified Stephenson in 1950, the first woman to achieve this certification, and in 1951 she became the first woman to join the American Association of Plastic Surgeons (in 2013 called the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery). She was a member of the board of directors of the Plastic Surgery Educational Foundation from 1961–63 and was a founding member of the California Society of Plastic Surgeons, of which she was president from 1967-68. She also was a fellow of the American College of Surgeons.

They were then selected for the national final of the Yamaha trophy in which they finished third. After their appearance on the TV, Avispa Music noticed them and offered them a three-year contract. The album was recorded that summer, containing the same songs as Rock Transgresivo (in addition to \\"Amor Castúo\\").

As National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union (AWU) from 1944 to 1972, he was one of the most powerful figures in the Australian labor movement and the Labor Party. Biography Dougherty was born in Bollon, Queensland, the son of a telegraph linesman and a schoolteacher. He left school at 13 and worked in a variety of manual jobs in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian territory of Papua New Guinea. In 1924 he married Ruby McArthur: they had three children. After his wife's death he married again, in 1951, and again in 1959. In 1932 Dougherty became an organiser for the AWU in Mackay, Queensland. He became the union's northern district secretary in 1938 and Queensland branch president in 1943. This position gave him a position on the central executive of the Queensland branch of the Labor Party. Dougherty was on the right wing of Labor, being a strong anti-communist at a time when the Communist Party of Australia was very powerful in the unions, particularly in north Queensland. In January 1944 Dougherty was appointed general secretary of the AWU, a position he retained until his death, and he moved to Sydney to work at the union's head office. His abrasive style made him many enemies, notably the federal Labor politician Clyde Cameron. He kept the AWU apart from the rest of the union movement, and refused to join the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), which he regarded as under Communist influence, until 1967. Despite his conservative views, in 1955 he threw the AWU's weight behind the Labor leader H. V. Evatt in his battle with B. A. Santamaria's \\"Movement\\" forces. Although a right- winger, Dougherty was a Presbyterian and disliked the Catholic influence that Santamaria represented. He also suspected that Santamaria's forces were trying to gain control of the AWU. Dougherty was regarded even by his enemies as a very effective trade union leader, and he built the AWU up to be largest and wealthiest union in Australia, with 180,000 members in the 1950s. He helped to make Australian shearers the highest paid in the world. The AWU's industrial muscle kept Communist influence out of the union and made both employers and other unions wary of antagonising the AWU. Dougherty stated in 1954 that \\"The Australian Workers Union bars communists from admission.\\" Tom Dougherty in the same interview proclaimed that the Union also bars \\"Asiatics and Kanakas from membership.\\" highlighting his long-term advocacy for the White Australia Policy; in the same article he referred to the Australian Workers Union as the 'spearhead' of the 'White Australia Forces' which sought to the repatriation of coloured labourers. Dougherty argued that the Communist Party's interest in ending the White Australia Policy was in 'conformity' with instructions from the Communist International. further he tabled a motion in the Union's executive council directing the union to oppose \\"attempts being made by a strange combination of certain wealthy employing interests and the Communist Party to secure the free entry of coloured and Asiatic labour into Australia.\\" In 1950, at the height of the Cold War, Dougherty visited the United States at the invitation of the American Federation of Labor and addressed its convention in Houston, calling for the end of all trade with the Soviet Union. In 1953 he and Laurie Short, leader of the Federated Ironworkers' Association, met with U.S. Vice-President Richard Nixon and briefed him on what they claimed was the continuing strength of Communism in the Australian unions. In September 1957, Dougherty was chosen to be a Labor member of the NSW Legislative Council (then indirectly elected by the Legislative Assembly). He had long believed that the council should be abolished, and had criticised the NSW Labor Party for failing to carry out this policy. He promised to resign if he failed to abolish the council. Following the defeat of a 1961 referendum to abolish it, he carried out this promise and resigned. In his last years he was a strong supporter of Gough Whitlam in his battles with the Labor left, but he did not live to see the election of the Whitlam government, dying of a sudden heart attack during the 1972 election campaign.
