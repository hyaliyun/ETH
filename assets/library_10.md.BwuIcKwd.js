History  In the winter of 2002, the Disabled people in Israel demanded a higher Disability allowance, and demonstrated in front of the Israeli Government. After 78 days, they reached an agreement which was made by Avigdor Yitzhaki, the CEO of the Prime Minister's Office. Following the model of the Disabled people's strike which ended, the chairman of Acha Aharon Eini, Login is required. launched on May 5, 2002, a struggle whose headline was \\"A Deaf Government\\", for improving the conditions of the Deaf people in Israel. He did it after months of talks with the National Insurance Institute and Molsa, which resulted nothing. Eini also published a full list of the demands of the Israeli Deaf people, which included among the rest: # A communication assistance with purchasing accessories modified for Deaf people, like a flashing doorbell, a vibrating alarm clock, an Infant crying detector. # Interpretation by sign language and subtitles in news programs during reasonable viewing hours (operated in 2018 by Closed captioning). # Increasing of Israeli sign language interpretation hours from 16 hours to 50 hours during a year for every Deaf person. # Deaf people received only 630 ILS from their Health maintenance organizations when they purchased hearing aids, whose cost was 4,000 ILS. A full Assistance is requested. # Supplying interpretation in job interviews, work meetings and firing in the work place of the Deaf person. # A full interpretation for the Deaf students in the universities. # Recognition of Israeli sign language as an official language in Israel, alongside Hebrew and Arabic. # Supplying Israeli Telecommunications relay services for Deaf people (operated since summer 2009 by Israeli telecommunication regulations). # Assistance with operating of Deaf clubs in Israel. # Additional Earned income tax credits to Deaf workers. # Voiding the annual governmental radio fee in vehicles of Deaf people. # A professional mental treatment for Deaf people, including sign language mastering. On May 13, 2002, there was a discussion in the Knesset about the demonstration of the Deaf people at the government quarters. MK Ilan Gilon talked without his sound, but moved his lips, for demonstrating the situation of the Deaf people. MK Ophir Pines-Paz said that the requests of the Deaf people were basic and stable, but their representatives were tricked. MK Mohammad Barakeh said that the Deaf people had to pay an annual governmental radio fee in their cars, although they did not hear it. Like Pines, he said that their demands were basic, trivial and banal. Other MKs said similar words, and MK Muhamad Kanan talked about 70% of unemployment among the Deaf people. Nissim Dahan the Minister of Health agreed with the speeches, although he represented the government, and other MKs told him it. At the end of the discussion, there was a vote of 19 supporters and without opponents, to move the issue to the committee of the work and welfare. On May 21, 2002, there was a meeting between Eini and the Treasury, which lasted until the wee hours of the night. Eini requested 50 million ILS per year, and the Treasury agreed up to 9 million ILS. On June 9, 2002, Eini said that the Treasury suggested 20‚Äì22 million ILS, and the requests of the Deaf people remained 40‚Äì55 million ILS. The Treasury suggested a monthly allowance of 300 ILS to every Deaf person, plus 1,500 ILS every four years for purchasing a communications equipment, but Eini did not accept these 1,500 ILS. The Hard of hearing (Hoh) people did not assist the demonstration, and Gali Beiner, a member of Bekol, an Israeli organization of Hoh people, wrote about it. After the demonstration was ended, the Hoh with hearing loss of 70 db and down, demanded their rights as well, although the major part of them did not know sign language. They demanded from Acha to handle them, although they were not members of Acha.  Kind of assistance  Interpretation to the Israeli Sign Language in the meeting of the Hebrew Wikipedia in the Cinema City, Jerusalem, January 11, 2019 On June 12, 2002, Eini signed an agreement which was written by the head of the Budget Division Ori Yogev, and was signed by him and by the Minister of Finance Silvan Shalom as well. Its main clauses were: # Assistance would be given to a Deaf or Hoh person who lost his hearing up to the age of three years, and the hearing loss is at least 70 Decibels in the better ear. # 45 hours of Israeli sign language interpretation for every Deaf or Hoh person. Hoh is eligible to replace interpretation with transcription. # 288 ILS per month as a communication allowance for a Deaf worker, and 260 ILS for a Deaf non-worker. # Buying communication assistance up to 3,000 ILS for 4 years. This assistance is paid by supplying receipts. # The sums are linked to the consumer price index and are updated each year. # Elderly Deaf people were eligible for 25% of these sums. This clause was voided in March 2018 by Molsa. # An addition of 300,000 ILS in 2002 from Molsa for running Israeli Deaf clubs by Acha. # The Minister of Finance would not object a legislative proposal, which exempts Deaf people from paying the annual radio fee in their vehicles. The agreement was recorded as Social Work Regulations 5.7 in Molsa. This kind of the regulations is signed by the CEO of Molsa instead of its Minister.  Violations of the agreement  In 2009 Ester Goldblat, a manager at the Department of Rehabilitation in Molsa, made an interpretation survey by sending questionnaires to Israeli sign language interpreters, and repeated it on May 18, 2012, by sending questionnaires to Deaf and Hoh people, asking them about their interpretation services. On June 13, 2012, Goldblat requested Deaf and Hoh people to answer a survey about their vibrating pagers, which they received from the Home Front Command, in order to alert them in cases of war alarms. Goldblat also prohibited a Deaf person to invite an interpreter for making a phone call, and forced the interpreter to tell her the email address of the Deaf person, instead of sending a letter to this person. When the person asked Molsa about this prohibition, Molsa replied that the specific interpreter reported excessive hours, in spite of the Deaf person signs the interpretation form and writes also the interpreting hours. At the end of 2012, the Institute for the Advancement of Deaf Persons in Israel received a notice from Molsa about cutting interpretation hours of Deaf people in 2013. Interpretation to Deaf people would be given by the following order: Health care, Education, Welfare, Employment, Culture and Leisure. Molsa instructed the institute to stop interpretations for Culture and Leisure. As a result, on December 30, 2012, there was a demonstration in Tel Aviv of about 250 Deaf people against the government. In the demonstration participated Shai Piron, MK Dov Khenin, Stav Shaffir, Karin Elharar, and Yehuda Doron. On August 26, 2018, Orly Guetta from Molsa requested an Israeli Deaf person to explain the Social Work Regulations 5.7 to her. Then, on September 5, 2018, Goldblat denied a refund of 17% VATThe VAT in Israel is in a state of flux. It was reduced from 18% to 17% in March 2004, to 16.5% in September 2005, then to 15.5% in July 2006. Then it was raised back to 16.5% in July 2009, and lowered to the rate of 16% in January 2010. Then it was raised again to 17% on September 1, 2012, and once again to 18% on June 2, 2013. In October 2015 it was reduced from 18% to 17%. from this Deaf person, who purchased a Xiaomi smartphone from China by eBay, although the Deaf person in question did not live in Eilat,In Eilat, VAT is not paid. and paid the VAT legally to the Israel Tax Authority. This person wrote to Haim Katz the Minister of Welfare, but did not get a reply for about two months.

A French architect, named Andr√© Godard, started the construction of the museum on May 11, 1934 by the order of Reza Shah. The museum building was completed in 1937 and then was opened for first public visits. The land allocated to this museum is 5,500 square meters, of which 2,744 square meters is used for the foundation of the museum. The building Since the design of a museum should be relevant to its theme and the objects inside it, as well as being linked to the history and the art of that land, therefore, the facade and the entrance of the museum were both made in the same style of Taq Kasra. Taq Kasra was a palace in Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sasanian Empire. The porch to the palace is 35 meters tall, 50 meters wide and 25 meters deep. Bricks used are dark red to reflect the Sasanian architecture. The museum is about 11,000 square meters, with its main building built in three floors. The architects of this building, Andre Godard, along with Maxim Sirow, were French architects whose designs were inspired from the Palace of Kasra in the city of Ctesiphon of the Sasanian era. The construction of the museum was started in the year 1934 and was completed within two years by Haj Abbasali Memar and Professor Morad Tabrizi. It was officially opened in 1937. Primarily, the first floor of the museum was dedicated to pre-Islamic history of Iran and the second floor to the post-Islamic era. The development of archaeological excavations and the increasing accumulation of works in the Museum of Ancient Iran caused the museum to be in several stages, quantitative and qualitative expansion between the years 1979 to 1991, in addition to replacing museum displays, modernizing the heating system and the electrical system of the museum. Also the warehouse and treasures were built and added to the museum. In 1996, the works of the Islamic era were officially separated from the Museum of Ancient Iran and moved to the adjacent building, which had been built in 1958. This building was originally intended to be an anthropology museum. But after Iranian revolution, with the establishment of the Cultural Heritage Organization and the concentration of ancient objects in the Museum of Ancient Iran, it was suggested that the museum be renamed to the National Museum of Iran and another museum named Museum of the Islamic Art be added to it. Eventually, in 1996, with the official opening of the Islamic Museum, the whole complex of the Museum of Ancient Iran and the Museum of Islamic Era was officially named as the National Museum of Iran.Iran's Museums Features The oldest part of the museum, built by hand is made of quartz stones found in the basin of the river Kashaf Rud east of the city of Mashhad. The stones are more than a million years old. In this section, you will also find a treasure trove of Gilan province also of near Mahabad, which goes back to 200 to 700 thousand years ago. From middle Paleolithic period, which coincides with the emergence of Neanderthal human in Iran, also remains of interesting tools made of pyrite or remains of animal fossil fountains, found in caves in Zagros Mountains and central Iranian Plateau like the caves of Bisotun and Khorramabad which are put on show in the museum. In the New Paleolithic period, which corresponds with the expansion of modern human intelligence in Iran, the construction of a blade of tools became common place. The oldest human remains discovered in Iran are seen in this section, which is known for its tooth. This tooth is the oldest remains of human fossils in Iran, which has been directly narrated and discovered in a cave, near Kermanshah, called Wazma. This small Asian tooth, which is related to a nine-year-old child, belonged to 20‚Äì25 thousand years ago was discovered by gamma-ray spectroscopy. In the new Paleolithic period, making bone tools and using personalized decorations such as pillow pendants, animal teeth, and flowers were also common in Iran. One of the most important places of this period is the cave named Yafteh in Lorestan province which displays many of these objects in the museum hall. Some examples of hybrid instruments, the application of stratification, and the preservation of foodstuffs from the Ali Tappeh cave in Mazandaran and Shalom cave in Ilam which are associated to the Metamorphosed Rock period can also be seen in the museum. From the Neolithic and Romanesque art, works such as the oldest Iranian clay from the Gange Darre Hill, the oldest human and animal mud samples from the Sarab Hill, and some stone tools are shown in the hall... Shoush (Khuzestan), Ismail-Abad and Cheshmeh Ali (Tehran), Taleyakon (Fars) from the most important sites in the 5th and 4th millennium BC. (Copper and stones) in Iran, with samples of their pottery are painted and seen in the hall. Interesting patterns of this period can be seen in the simplified pattern of mountain goats, which are seen at the level of pottery of Ismail-Abad and Cheshmeh Ali. Vessels of Jiroft and Shahdad with diverse designs such as the battle of man with mythological beasts and the pattern of geometric, animal and plant elements are typical examples of these vessels displayed in showcases. Another important work of this period in the museum is the flower of Shahdad, which shows the naked man with his hands on the chest, probably in prayer mode. Containers, war devices, decorative objects, human and animal buildings, including the metal objects of the late Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age, are shown in the hall. A number of objects displayed in the prehistoric art section of the hall belong to the Ilam civilization. Of all the periods in Ilam, many works of art have survived, but the middle era of Ilam, is known as one of the most beautiful trials of the Ilamis. Chogha Zanbil. Temple is one of the most important architectural remnants of this period, with remarkable works such as cow's statue with inscriptions, glass tubes, bricks and clones on it, are featured in the hall. The works in the museum hall attributable to the Medes era are from the ancient places of Nowshajan, Hasanlu, Godin, and Babajan. During this era, the construction of iron objects expanded, including the objects of Hasanlu, which is one of the most prominent examples in the hall. Also a beautiful glazed pottery was created, a spectacular example of which is the glaze of Zivia, showing two goats on the two sides of a Lotus flower.Tehran, National Museum  Gallery  file:Iwan Muzeh melli.jpg|museum entrance. file:Persepolis Apadana Stairways in National Museum of Iran.jpg|stairs to Perspolis file:Dariush in National Museum of Iran.jpg|the statue of the Great Cyroos file:Persepolis Apadana column in National Museum of Iran.jpg|perspolis file:Achaemenid Statue Sitting lion in National Museum of Iran.jpg|¬´Lion without head - Achaemenid file:Parthian Man (Surena) Statue in Iran-e Bastan Museum.jpg|Soorna Parthian file:Parthian Princess in National Museum of Iran.jpg|A Parthian Princess file:Museh Melli.jpg|a view from museum References Category:1934 establishments in Iran Category:Museums established in 1934 Category:Cultural infrastructure completed in 1937 Category:Museums in Tehran Category:History museums in Iran Category:Archaeological museums ","title":"Museum of Ancient Iran"},{"id":"58846125","text":"MƒÅngere-≈åtƒÅhuhu Local Board is one of the 21 local boards of the Auckland Council, and is overseen by the council's Manukau Ward councillors.

He led Fujairah in a number of insurrections against Al Qasimi rule, presiding over a turbulent time when the emirate was practically independent but denied recognition of status as a Trucial State in its own right by the British.  Insurrection  Hamad was headman of Fujairah town in 1879 when he led an insurrection in spring of that year against Sheikh Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi of Sharjah, who claimed suzerainty over the Gulf of Oman coast (known as Shamaliyah) and had placed a slave named Sarur in charge of Fujairah. This followed a prolonged period of contested ownership of areas of the coast between the Al Qasimi of Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah and the Sultan of Muscat. The insurrection replaced Sarur and a delegation was sent to Sheikh Saqr but they were badly received, imprisoned and a force sent back against the insurrectionists, taking Fujairah Fort and forcing Hamad bin Abdullah into exile. At the end of that year or possibly early 1880, Hamad returned from his exile and led a fresh bid to proclaim the independence of Fujairah, this time forcing a rout of Fujairah Fort, with eight men among the defenders killed. The settlement of a peace was placed in front of the Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah to arbitrate and, in 1881, Hamad bin Abdullah signed a document confirming him as a dependent of Sharjah. It was the British viewpoint at the time that the 'complete independence of Fujairah ought not to be promoted'. However, Hamad was a troublesome subject and played both Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah off against each other, as well as involving the Sultan in Muscat wherever he could.  Al Bithnah fort  In 1884, he took Al Bithnah Fort, a strategically important asset guarding the Wadi Ham, which was the major route inland from Shamaliyah. Bithnah Fort Control of Bithnah was to be essential for Hamad bin Abdullah when, in 1901, he once again refused the suzerainty of Sharjah and used the fort at Bithnah to refuse aid to the headman of Kalba, who was related to Sheikh Saqr bin Khalid of Sharjah. As in so many occasions in the history of the Trucial States, the dispute flared up and each side gathered its backers. In April 1902, Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi had gathered a force of 250 mounted Bedouin to attack Fujairah, while Hamad bin Abdullah petitioned Dubai and Ajman as well as the Sultan of Muscat for their help. The British caught wind of the impending conflict and intervened, warning Muscat and Dubai to stand down. Attempting to mediate the dispute in Sharjah, the British Residency Agent found both Saqr bin Khalid protesting that he could not control his Bedouin and Hamad bin Abdullah refusing to recognise a safe pass to Sharjah as legitimate. In November, repenting of his conciliatory attitude, Saqr bin Khalid had two Fujairah men killed on their way to Ajman. The next month, the British Political Agent in Bahrain, Gaskin, travelled to Sharjah in the RIMS Lawrence and then on to Fujairah, holding two days of negotiations between the warring parties. The situation onshore being increasingly threatening and both parties intractable, the attempt was abandoned and the British left them to it, with the sole proviso that they wouldn't break the Maritime Peace. Declaring his independence in 1901, Sheikh Hamad enjoyed the recognition of this status by all concerned, with the sole exception of the British. In 1903, the British once again decided not to recognise Fujairah but to consider it a dependency of Sharjah. Despite a sally by Saqr bin Khalid against Bithnah early in the year and an exhortation to peace by Curzon during his 1903 vice regal Durbar, Fujairah remained a nominal dependency at best and in 1906 was claimed as a dependency of Abu Dhabi, with no opposition from Sharjah.  War with Kalba and Khor Fakkan  In 1926, the strained relations between Fujairah and the Sharjah dependencies of Kalba and Khor Fakkan broke out into open warfare, despite Hamad bin Abdullah having married the daughter of the Al Qasimi wali of both towns. Open fighting continued for the following three years and broke out again in 1927. Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Sharqi died in the early 1930s and was succeeded by his son, Saif bin Hamad Al Sharqi.

It is widely (not universally) considered to be a hangover remedy.Annie Kay, Bulgaria, Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 57DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Istanbul, 2014, p. 199  Etymology  The Turkish name , meaning \\"tripe soup\\", consists of (\\"stomach/tripe\\"), (\\"soup\\"), and the possessive affix that links the two words. It came from Persian (, \\"rumen\\") and (, \\"soup\\") came from Persian. Some South Slavic languages borrowed the dish name from Turkish: as () in Bulgarian and Macedonian, and as () in Serbian and Bosnian.  Variants   Turkey  link=ƒ∞≈ükembe √ßorbasƒ± In Turkey, tripe chorba is generally made of cow's stomach and eaten usually with a vinegar-garlic sauce added on the table or with the addition of an egg yolk-lemon juice (called terbiye) in the kitchen, after cooking and before service. Although the general name is very common, especially at the traditional restaurants dedicated to this soup, offal of cow and sheep and (sheep head meat, especially cheeks, baked) are also offered. A dish can be ordered and made from the various parts of the stomach: \\"\\". As in several other countries, it is seen as a \\"hangover remedy\\" and finds itself a place in almost all New Year's Eve menus, served right after midnight. This has been the case since the 1800s, when it was first reported as a popular soup among Ottomans to consume immediately after a session of heavy social drinking, usually of rakƒ±.  Bulgaria  link=Shkembe chorba In Bulgaria, a whole pork, beef or lamb tripe is boiled for few hours, chopped in small pieces, and returned to the broth. The soup is spiced with ground red paprika which is briefly fried (–∑–∞–ø—Ä—ä–∂–∫–∞), and often small quantity of milk is added. Traditionally, the soup is served with mashed garlic in vinegar and hot red pepper. There is a variant of the soup with intestines instead of tripe. The soup was very popular with the working classes until the late 1980s, and there were many restaurants serving only shkembe chorba (—à–∫–µ–º–±–µ–¥–∂–∏–π–Ω–∏—Ü–∞, \\"shkembe-restaurant\\"). Later they were replaced by fast food restaurants but the soup is still highly regarded, and is part of the menu in any cheap to moderately-priced restaurant. Office workers avoid eating shkembe chorba at lunch, or eat it without adding garlic.  Romania  link=CiorbƒÉ de burtƒÉ The Romanian name for the sour tripe soup is ciorbƒÉ de burtƒÉ (from ciorbƒÉ 'sour soup' < Turkish √ßorba + burtƒÉ 'tripe'). The Romanian ciorbƒÉ de burtƒÉ is similar to ciorbƒÉ de ciocƒÉnele (soup from pork legs). CiorbƒÉ de burtƒÉ is often seasoned with vinegar, sour cream (sm√¢nt√¢nƒÉ) and garlic dip (crushed garlic mixed with oil), called mujdei. The Romanian journalist Radu Anton Roman said this about CiorbƒÉ de burtƒÉ: \\"This dish looks like it is made for drunk coachmen but it has the most sophisticated and pretentious mode of preparation in all Romanian cuisine. It‚Äôs sour and sweet, hot and velvety, fatty but delicate, eclectic and simple at the same time.Des poissons sur le sable by , √âditions Noir sur Blanc, publi√© en 1997\\"  Serbia  In Serbia, this soup is made of fresh tripe cooked with onions, garlic and paprika. It is usually seasoned with fried bacon and more garlic, sometimes thickened with flour (). Some versions of shkembe chorba are made with milk; garlic, vinegar, and chili peppers are often added as seasoning.

The Kol people were joined by other communities including the Mundas, Oraons, Hos leading to some authors also calling it the Munda uprising. The uprising was a reaction to the appointment of a Political Agent to the Government in South Bihar and recently ceded districts nearby around 1819. This resulted in many people moving into these areas which were the lands of numerous indigenous tribes. These tribes had no rulers and their lands were divided according to families that were bound by \\"parhas\\" or conferences. With the application of new land laws, the indigenous Kols were exploited by outsiders moving into the area and taking up agriculture and commercial activities that were alien to tribal culture. Many of the lands of the locals were taken away as securities for un-returned loans. The locals whose languages were unknown to the settlers were physically tortured and mistreated in a number of incidents. Another irritation was the taxation on the movement of products such as salt that were formerly freely moved. Corrupt official practices and lawlessness followed. The masses of common people, of whom the Kols were the largest in number, burnt the houses of the newly settled people in revenge. British historiography treated the rebellious tribals as bandits. In 1831, the Kol tribesmen of Chhota Nagpur who had been exploited by the agents of the colonial rulers burst out in rebellion.The rebel kols were under the leadership of Buddhu Bhagat, Joa Bhagat, Madara Mahato and others. The Kols grew restive over the increasing encroachment on tribal territories by the non tribals like Muslim and Sikhs. The new non-tribal landlords resorted to forced labour, fines, and often \\"took away their cattle\\". The Kol insurrection started in 1831 when the farm of two sikh thikadars (contractors) was plundered and burnt. In 1832, there were clashes between the armed forces and the tribals Kols rebels. Professor Sunil Sen mentions that in a memorable resistance Bhundu Bhagat and his followers fought with primitive weapons until they perished to the last man (Peasant Movement in India:p7:Sunil Sen) The characteristic feature of the Kol rebellion was that the Kol tribesmen did not fight alone against the British. Other tribesmen like the Hos, Oraons, and Mundas joined hands with them. The Kol did not hesitate to fight with traditional weapons against the British army who fought with modern instruments of warfare.

In 1952 he was to see his father's long-held dream of independence for Fujairah recognised by the British, as well as shortly afterwards to help take the UAE to independence as a nation, in 1971.  Accession  Mohammed bin Hamad succeeded as head of the Sharqiyin tribe and Sheikh of Fujairah in 1939 on the death of his elder brother, Saif bin Hamad, and immediately set about consolidating the Sharqiyin holdings of Fujairah and its surroundings. By 1950, he had won over Dibba to the North, as well as the coastal settlements of Bidayah and Sakamkam and the inland village of Al Bithnah the strategically important Al Bithnah Fort dominating the Wadi Ham.  Trucial status  The British had staunchly refused recognition of Fujairah's independence in the 50-odd years since Mohammed's father had proclaimed it in 1901. However, by the 1950s PCL, Petroleum Concessions Limited, was seeking oil exploration concessions throughout the Trucial States and the company needed someone they could 'do business with'. The government (by now affairs in the Trucial States were squarely in the hands of the Foreign Office in London following Indian independence in 1947) decided to grant Mohammed bin Hamad recognition as a Trucial Ruler and he acceded in 1952 as the Ruler of the seventh emirate to be so recognised (Kalba, previously recognised as a Trucial State in 1939, was subsumed back into Sharjah in 1951).  Independence  Fujairah was the last of the Trucial States to become a British protectorate where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence. While others had signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820, the Perpetual Maritime Truce of 1853, and the 'Exclusive Agreement' of 1892, Fujairah was to enjoy just sixteen years of British protection until British Prime Minister Harold Wilson's announcement, on 16 January 1968, that all British troops were to be withdrawn from 'East of Aden'. The decision was to pitch the coastal emirates, together with Qatar and Bahrain, into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind. Mohammed bin Hamad was to join the meeting of Trucial Rulers on 25 February 1968 in Dubai, at which the principle of founding a union of emirates was laid out by the Rulers of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai. Over the next two years, negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed‚Äîoften stormy‚Äîas a form of union was thrashed out. Bahrain and Qatar dropped out of talks and Ras Al Khaimah decided not to accede to the Union, leaving six of the seven former Trucial States to agree on union on 18 July 1971. On 2 December 1971, Fujairah, together with Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman and Umm Al Quwain joined in the Act of Union to form the United Arab Emirates. The seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the UAE on 10 February 1972, following Iran's annexation of the RAK-claimed Tunbs islands.  Fighting  The long history of squabbles and disputes between Fujairah and its neighbour came to the fore once again following the act of Union, when a land dispute broke out into open fighting. In early 1972, the newly founded Union Defence Force was called in to take control of the fighting which, by the time the UDF moved in, had killed 22 and seriously injured a dozen more. The dispute was finally settled after mediation between Sheikh Rashid of Dubai and other Rulers and a statement announcing the settlement was sent out on 17 July 1972.  Death  Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Sharqi died in 1974 or 1975. He was succeeded by his son, Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi, the present Ruler of Fujairah.

Bremen was a geographically small but industrially, commercially and economically dynamic \\"autonomous component state\\" which had become part of Germany in 1871. Geusendam was politically engaged and became increasingly active. This came to the attention of the authorities. In 1908, after taking part in a strike, still aged only 22, he was identified as a \\"troublesome foreigner\\" (\\"l√§stiger Ausl√§nder\\") and deported from Bremen. Till 1933 Germany resisted pressure to copy the Anglo-French model of an ever more centrally controlled state, and Geusendam's expulsion became the focus of a thirty year foreign policy debate in the Bremen B√ºrgerschaft (parliament) as to whether or not depriving a man of citizens' rights fell within the competence of the city authorities and their senate. One reason that Geusendam was the focus of the debate for so long is that after his expulsion he soon returned, illegally, to Bremen for family reasons, and the authorities grudgingly suspended his expulsion. He was expelled again in 1921 but managed, with the support of the labour movement, to remain in Bremen till 1931, when he really was expelled. The family relocated briefly to the Soviet Union. Later he fell foul of the Hitler government as a result of his political activities in the border region between the Netherlands and Germany. He was arrested in 1940 and held in government detention at a succession of institutions till, through physical mistreatment and malnutrition, he died in April 1945.  Biography  Johann Mathias Geusendam was born at Rijssen, a country town in the flatlands between Apeldoorn and Enschede. This part of the Netherlands was becoming increasingly polarised in religious terms, and in 1890 his Catholic family moved away from the little town where they were finding it impossible to find work because power and influence had become monopolized by members of the ultra-orthodox Calvinist community. The Geusendams relocated across the border to Ahaus. In 1905 Johann Geusendam teamed up with Katharina Cordes, originally from Oldenburg and the two of them moved on to Bremen. They subsequently married. Johann Geusendam began to involve himself politically in the Bremen Labour movement. By 1908 he was working in a steel tube mill where on 1 May 1908 he took part in a May Day strike. He was singled out as a \\"troublesome foreigner\\" (\\"l√§stiger Ausl√§nder\\"). It was said that he had threatened a strike-breaker and stolen wax with a value of 70 pfennigs: he was expelled from Bremen. He returned to the city illegally following the birth of his first son. The authorities now provisionally suspended the expulsion order on condition that he would keep out of trouble and care for his wife and child. He was kept under police surveillance, however. During the period of the short-lived Bremen Soviet, in the winter of 1918/1919, he was repeatedly arrested by the Reichswehr (national militia) and by members of \\"Freikorps\\" volunteer units, composed largely of former members of the old German army who had come together to resist a rerun in Germany of Petrograd's October Revolution. In 1922 the authorities prepared to enact Geusendam's expulsion, which had never been formally rescinded, because of his \\"active membership\\" of the recently founded Communist Party. His fate was discussed with some passion in the B√ºrgerschaft (Bremen parliament), and in the end, on the day the vote was taken, two conservative members were away. By a narrow majority the assembly voted to reverse the senate's decision. Bremen was an industrial port city and the political left-wingers who were powerfully present in the parliament at that time were persuaded that Geusendam's political opinion - the point on which the \\"bourgeois\\" conservative members had chosen to focus the argument - was not a justification for expelling a man and his family from Bremen. Geusendam, his wife and their two sons remained for the time being. But the family were never able to relax completely. Years later Wilhelm Geusendam, Johann Geusendam's son, would remember the children being woken up by their mother at four in the morning during the crisis year of 1923 so that they might say good bye to their father who was being taken into \\"protective custody\\". The detention did not last long on this occasion, but further troubles followed. While cleaning out this inside of a boiler, Johann's father was killed in an industrial accident at the vast textiles plant where he worked. Another near relative was killed in a mine disaster. Johann Geusendam himself was unemployed for much of this period. For a long time, despite intensively researching the matter, the police found no sufficient reason to implement the Geusendams' expulsion. Eventually, on 31 March 1931, the Senator responsible for policing, Senator Deichmann put his signature to the necessary docuemnt. On 18 March 1931, after more than 23 years of living with the uncertainty set off by the original expulsion order, Geusendam and his family returned from Bremen to the Netherlands. The increasing polarisation of German politics had opened the way for the \\"conservative\\" members of the city government to have their way. Even after the family had left the city, there was a final heated discussion of the matter in the Bremen B√ºrgerschaft (parliament). A submission from the Workers' Singing Association provided the parliamentarian Gesine Becker with a final opportunity to berate fellow members over the \\"political justification\\" of the expulsion order. For Geusendam the expulsion to the Netherlands could also be seen as an opportunity, and as soon as their younger son had completed his school exams the family moved to the Soviet Union to experience \\"real-life socialism\\" (\\"real existierenden Sozialismus‚Äú \\"). It is not entirely clear what they found or what they did there, but three years later, in 1934, the Geusendams returned to the Netherlands thoroughly disillusioned. The chasm between idealistic aspirations and what was possible seems to have been unbridgable. Back in the Netherlands Johann Geusendam left his wife and younger son to live on welfare. (The elder son, Wilhelm, returned to Moscow for another year.) Johann Geusendam, despite the disappointments of the three years in the Soviet Union, had lost none of his own political passion. The situation Germany changed at the beginning of 1933 when the National Socialists took power and lost no time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. Those with any sort of a political record - especially, after February 1933, if that record involved the Communist Party - came under surveillance and were over the next few months arrested. Others fled. Johann Geusendam, now based close to the German frontier in the Netherlands and a member of the Enschede branch of the Dutch Communist Party, worked with the International Red Aid (workers' welfare) association on \\"refugee work\\" - helping political refugees escaping from Germany. By 1935/36, if not earlier, the Gestapo were aware of his \\"political work\\" at the border. 1935 had been the year his son had escaped from an increasingly xenophonic Soviet Union to be arrested by the Gestapo on his return to Germany and sentenced by the special peoples' court in Berlin to a five year jail term. During the later 1930s there was a widespread belief that war would soon return to Europe, but many in the Netherlands (including the government) believed that it would be possible for that country to remain neutral, as it had in the First World War. This was not to be. German armies over-ran the country in May 1940. With the Netherlands under German occupation it was possible for the political opponents of National Socialism to experience the same levels Gestapo of surveillance and control as in Germany itself. Johann Geusendam was arrested by the Gestapo in October 1940 and deported to M√ºnster, a city near the Dutch border, but on the German side of it. Over the next five years he enjoyed an inside seat in respect of the horrors of Germany's National Socialist justice system. He remained in protective custody in M√ºnster till 1942. Geusendam faced the special peoples' court in Berlin in 1942 and was sentenced to spend more time in prison. He was held till 1944 at Brandenburg-G√∂rden and then transported to the south of the country where he was held in Schloss (i.e. Castle) Kaltenstein, a short distance outside Stuttgart. The Schloss had been used since 1843 as a workhouse,and then, during the National Socialist years, as a gathering point for prisoners of war and as a \\"protective custody\\" establishment for people the government did not wish to have released. Internal national security had to be preserved (\\"... Aus Gr√ºnden der inneren Sicherheit des Staates\\"). It was here that he died on 6 April 1945, a victim of physical mistreatment and malnutrition, and a day before the establishment was liberated by French troops.

The club was started by Billy Reilly and Keith Reilly (the subsequent founder of Fabric), who had originally wanted to open a pre-club drinks bar next to Bagleys nightclub. Camden Council however granted the Reilly brothers a full dance licence and they started hosting club events at the Cross, immediately attracting a well-dressed crowd and a cult-like following.

He was the author of the first Chinese satirical comedy film in 1956. His career ended a year later when he was banned from film-making for The Unfinished Comedy, another satirical comedy, itself banned before its release and described both as notorious and \\"perhaps the most accomplished [Chinese] film made in the 17 years between 1949 and the Cultural Revolution\\".  Biography  L√º Ban studied in the Film Actor Training School of the United Photoplay Service, and subsequently worked as an actor and a comedian in leftist theater and cinema in Shanghai in the 1930s. He made his debut as an actor in Crossroads (Shizi jietou, 1937). He quickly gained fame, and has been even called \\"the Oriental Chaplin\\". In 1948 he joined the Northeast Film Studio and the following year he was involved in the production of Bridge, the first feature film of the post-war, communist China. His first films were revolutionary melodramas: in 1950 he co-directed with Yi Lin the Heroes of L√ºliang Mountain (L√ºliang yingxiong, 1950); in 1951, with Shi Dongshan, New Heroes and Heroines (Xin ern√º yingxiong zhuan); 1952 he directed Gate No. 6 (Liu hao men); in 1954, A Heroic Driver (Yingxiong siji), and in 1955 a musical, Chorus of the Yellow (Huangheda hechang). However, his most influential and discussed works were the three satirical comedies released during the period of lessened censorship in 1956‚Äì57 (known as the Hundred Flowers Campaign). Those three comedies have been described as some of the sharpest criticisms, at least in the film media of that period, of the contemporary Chinese society. One of the distinguishing feature of his movies of that period was the novelty or using fellow, socialist Chinese citizens as the subjects of satire, instead of the previously common, and safer, \\"corrupt GMD officials and snobbish urban socialites.\\" The works released during that brief period departed from the state-sanctioned topics aiming to legitimize the new state, offering \\"moral edification and celebrating the triumph of revolutionary virtue over reactionary villainy\\". The Man Who Doesn't Bother about Trifles (Buju xiaojie de ren, 1956) was the least controversial of the trio, likely due to \\"its trivial subject matter and mild satirical style\\". However, L√º Ban's other two movies proved to be much more problematic. Before the New Director Arrives (Xin ju zhang dao lai zhi qian, 1956), described as \\"the first satirical film to be made in the PRC\\", made fun of inefficient low ranking officials and exposed the hierarchical relationships occurring between the cadres, but led to L√º Ban being accused of \\"attacking the Party\\", while his next film, The Unfinished Comedy (Meiyou wancheng de xiju, 1957), critically dealing among others with the sensitive topic of film censorship, and since described as notorious, was labelled as a \\"poisonous weed\\" during the Anti-Rightist Movement and banned before its release. L√º Ban was accused of \\"mocking new persons and new things in a new Chinese society in the name of comedy\\" and in general, undermining socialist morality and attacking the Party. The Unfinished Comedy ended L√º Ban's career as shortly afterward, L√º Ban himself was banned from directing for life and sentenced to internal exile; he had to abandon work on film-making, leaving behind several unfinished projects, and died in 1976 without being allowed to work on another film. L√º Ban's fate was one of the reasons for other Chinese film makers putting more effort into self-censorship and abandoning the genre of satirical comedy (the next one would not appear in Chinese theaters until the mid-80s); for years to come, the dominant model of comedy in China became one that avoided conflict, and presented safe stories involving \\"model socialist citizens\\" learning how to better live in the \\"harmonious socialist society\\".

Etymology The genus epithet acer stems from the Latin \\"acro-\\", which roughly translates to sharp or rise out, referring to the shape of the leaves. In a similar vein, the species epithet argutum translates to mean \\"with notched edges\\". Distribution and habitat The pointed-leaf maple is native to areas near bodies of water such as rivers and streams, at elevations of 800‚Äì1900 metres. It is found of the woodland, subalpine mountainous areas of Honshu and Shikoku in Japan. It is often found at the edges of forests, as it requires partial sunlight; it grows in any type of soil and tolerates all pH levels. Description This species is a deciduous tree with an upright habit forming a dense canopy. The wide, green leaves are acuminate with 5 lobes. They change color from green to yellow and orange in autumn. It can grow up to 10 metres tall and 8 metres wide in 10 years. Uses The sugary sap is used as either a drink or made into syrup. The syrup is primarily used as a sweetener, and is sourced by tapping into the trunk during early spring, especially after a period of scarification. The leaves may be used in packaging in order to preserve apples or root crops.

Troubling relationship with wife  In the years leading up to the murder, Hoffman's relationship with his wife Carol Stebbins began to deteriorate. They had continually degraded as a couple since their marriage, often fighting in front of their children and having heated arguments in public. Various of Hoffman's co-workers at the time reportedly indicated that Hoffman would often complain to them about his relationship with Stebbins whilst at work. It has also been indicated that the complaints became more and more severe, eventually developing into somewhat detailed plans to one day kill Stebbins. The relationship deteriorated further upon Hoffman's mother, Helen Ulvinen, coming to live in their home as a permanent babysitter for the children. Ulvinen and Stebbins reportedly did not get along, and Stebbins told friends about her disagreement with Ulvinen on many issues. As the deterioration of the Hoffman's marriage continued over the two-week period in which Ulvinen lived with the couple, Hoffman is reported to have shared his intentions to kill his wife with his mother. Ulvinen is said to have agreed with Hoffman's intentions to kill Stebbins, and the two began to conspire as to how the murder should be carried out.  The crime  On August 10, 1980, David Francis Hoffman murdered his wife, Carol Stebbins. According to the facts of the court case that would follow, Hoffman and Stebbins had spent the day playing and spending time with their young children, whilst Hoffman's mother Ulvinen had been helping feed the children. Upon putting the children to sleep, Hoffman and Stebbins went up to their bedroom, where Hoffman attempted to initiate sexual intercourse with Stebbins, who refused. From here, Hoffman lost his temper and choked Stebbins to death. Following this, Hoffman woke his mother and told her to sit on the living room couch so she would have a view of each of the children's bedroom doors, so if they were to awake she could deal with them and they would not wander upstairs to find their dead mother. From here, Hoffman moved Stebbins‚Äô corpse to the bathroom, where he dismembered the body and placed the pieces in separate bags before attempting to dispose of the body through the garbage disposal and by burning. After realizing that this would not be viable, Hoffman drove the body to Weaver Lake and disposed of it. Returning home, Hoffman told his mother to clean all the sheets whilst he washed the bathroom to clear away the evidence. Following this, the pair composed a story whereby Stebbins was said to have left the house following a heated argument with Hoffman. Hoffman called the police with a missing person's report the next day and during the interviews and searches that followed, Hoffman and Ulvinen both continued to tell the fabricated story. On the 19th of August, 1980, David Francis Hoffman came clean and confessed to the police about the murder of his wife. In his testimony, Hoffman admitted to the fact that he had told his friends and his mother that he had been planning on killing his wife for months or years. He also made clear the part that his mother had played in the murder and the ensuing cover-up. Hoffman was charged with first degree murder and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment.  Action against Helen Ulvinen  Ulvinen was also charged with first degree murder, as under Minnesota law, criminal liability can rest on someone who \\"intentionally aids, advises, hires, councils or conspires with or otherwise procures\\" to commit a crime. Upon appealing this decision on the 17th of December 1981, it was presented that despite the known hatred between Ulvinen and Carrol Stebbins, Ulvinen played no real part in the encouragement, planning or procedure of Hoffman's murder. As such, the court saw to discharge her for the crime of murder by the first degree, instead suggesting that perhaps manslaughter may be more appropriate. However, she was never tried as such.  Attempted parole and release date  Due to the pre-1990 Minnesota law under which Hoffman was sentenced, David Hoffman was required to spend a minimum 17 years of his 30-year sentence without parole. He was eventually allowed to apply for parole in 1994, 3 years earlier than originally sentenced. The attempt however was unsuccessful. Hoffman again applied for parole in 2000 and was once again rejected due to his evident lack of rehabilitation. In the letter denying parole, then corrections commissioner Sheryl Ramstad Hvass outlined that Hoffman still had no ability to see that his actions were wrong. She further stated that due to his inability to recognize the enormity of the injustice, it would have been very much possible that when released to the outside world a similar crime would be committed. In both of these original parole enquiries, Hoffman's daughters testified against their mother's side of the family, stating that their father should be released from prison. Hoffman's third attempt at parole came in 2010, after the designated 30 years of imprisonment had been completed. This attempt saw a heavy backlash from Stebbins‚Äô family, insinuating that Hoffman still felt no remorse, and that the family was not ready for him to be released back into society. The parole board agreed, not granting parole and suggesting that another 6 years be served by Hoffman. In 2016, Hoffman's fourth attempt at parole was met with just as much hostility from Stebbins‚Äô family. However this time, the request for parole was granted. Stebbins‚Äô family reported that they were devastated and scared by the result, and thought that Hoffman's 37 years were not long enough. They were also reported to have said that they were going to continue fighting to keep Hoffman imprisoned even after his release. Under the details of his release, Hoffman was to spend 6 months at the Willow River/Moose Lake correctional facility in Minnesota. He would spend 6 months in this minimum security facility as part of intensive regimen of education in preparation for release. David Francis Hoffman was released from prison in April 2018. Hoffman was to serve 6 months under intense supervision before being reassessed and potentially allowed unrestricted freedom.  Stebbins family concern over release  Upon Hoffman's conditional release under intensive supervision, there has been some level of concern and outrage from the family of Carol Stebbins. According to reports, the family were extremely apprehensive about the release and were in great fear for their safety. This was to such an extent that Stebbins‚Äô mother, Phyllis Stebbins, contacted police regarding her personal protection and safety, as she believed that when Hoffman was released, he would target her as the figurehead of the movement trying to keep him incarcerated. The family felt the release is extremely unjust, with father Rodger Stebbins stating that \\"when he [Hoffman] got sentenced to life, that's what it should mean. Life. No parole. No nothing. He should not have walked a free man.\\" Stebbins' niece, Charity Larsen, has raised similar issues, saying that \\"it shouldn't even be an issue. He shouldn't have a second chance. She never got a second chance.\\" In light of their concern, Stebbins' family have continued to attempt further action to ensure that Hoffman is returned to prison. Before his 5th parole hearing in 2016, Carol's niece Jaquelin Stebbins created a petition directed towards the State of Minnesota Department of Corrections Parole Board, stating that the lack of remorse shown by Hoffman at previous parole hearings and in general should be enough to warrant his continued incarceration. The petition gained 578 signatures before the parole meeting but eventually failed as Hoffman was granted his release in April 2018. The Stebbins family were also not told any details of his release, including where his parole officer resided or his whereabouts of living upon release which, whilst standard procedure, the family still found worrying.

It runs from Olten along the Aare to Aarau.  Route The line runs to the north from Olten station, then runs in a wide arc to the southeast and swerves towards Dulliken. Next, the line then runs mainly to the northeast along the Aare. The line passes under part of the town of Aarau through the Aarau city tunnel, which is immediately followed by Aarau station. With the exception of the city tunnel, the line has no major engineering structures. North of Olten, two lines branch off to Basel (Hauenstein summit tunnel and Hauenstein base tunnel). The line to Aarau can also be reached directly from the base tunnel line via a connecting curve. The extensive track layouts of a former postal distribution centre and a former SBB freight depot, which is now operated privately as a \\"Cargo Service Center\\", lie to the south of the line between Dulliken and D√§niken.  History  In the 19th century, the still young federal state left the organisation of railways to the cantons, which in turn licensed the construction and operation of railways to private companies. While the cantons of Zurich and Aarau wanted a connection between Zurich and Basel either via the B√∂zberg Pass (the preference of Aargau) or via Waldshut and continuing on the German side of the Rhine (the preference of Z√ºrich), Basel advocated a railway junction in Olten, from which lines would run to Basel, Zurich, Lucerne, Bern and Biel. This was also the recommendation of a report, which was produced in 1850 by the well-known English railway engineers Robert Stephenson and Henry Swinburne. The Zurich preference was not carried out (at least for the time being), since after the completion of the Swiss Northern Railway (Spanisch-Br√∂tli-Bahn), there were financial problems. The Aargau preference (the B√∂zberg line) failed because the canton of Basel-Land did not issue a license for its construction. In Basel, the Swiss Central Railway was established to build the basic railway network. The Central Railway received in particular a license for the construction and operation of the line from Olten to W√∂schnau on the border of the cantons of Solothurn and Aarau, but not for the remaining short section from W√∂schnau to Aarau itself. This, as well as an extension in an easterly direction to Zurich, was awarded to the Swiss Northern Railway which operated the Z√ºrich‚ÄìBaden line. Thus, the line from Olten was built to the gates of Aarau by the Central Railway; this was put into operation on 9 June 1856\\\\. However, since the Swiss Northeastern Railway had not completed its line from Baden, it initially built a temporary station in Schachen Aarau. Once the Northeastern Railway had completed the Aarau City Tunnel in June 1858‚Äîthe line from Baden had meanwhile also reached Aarau‚Äîcontinuous operations were possible on the Olten‚ÄìAarau‚ÄìZ√ºrich route. A few years later, duplication of the Olten‚ÄìZ√ºrich line was completed on 16 July 1872. The electrification with the usual Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) 15 kV 16 2/3 Hz system was completed on 21 January 1925. Until the nationalisation of the large private railway companies to form the SBB, the Central Railway was responsible for the operation of the line. In the 1990s, the track layout of Aarau station was completely rebuilt. In particular, the western approach was rebuilt as four tracks and a second city tunnel was built. However, the continuation of the line to D√§niken is still double-track; this is a major bottleneck for east-west traffic. The extension of four tracks through Sch√∂nenwerd is not considered possible because of the dense development. In 2015, work began on the construction of the Eppenberg Tunnel to bypass Sch√∂nenwerd. Its commissioning is scheduled for the end of 2020.

Early life and education  The second of four sisters, Joan Crowfoot was born in 1912 in Giza (Egypt) to the educationalist and archaeologist John Winter Crowfoot (1873‚Äì1959) and Molly Crowfoot (nee Hood) (1877‚Äì1957). She and her older sister, the future Nobel-prize-winning chemist Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, attended the Sir John Leman Grammar School in Beccles, Suffolk. From 1929 to 1932 Crowfoot Payne studied at the London School of Medicine for Women but was unable to complete her medical training due to an eye condition. The following year, in 1932‚Äì1933, she attended the University of Cambridge as a Research Student on the Diploma Course in Archaeology. Her lack of Latin meant she could not sit the qualifying exam for the course. (Her sister Dorothy had to cram Latin in order to take up a place at Somerville College in Oxford.)  Career  Joan Crowfoot Payne participated in archaeological excavations in the U.K., Palestine, and Iraq studying lithics (chipped stone), and working with her father John Winter Crowfoot, Dorothy Garrod, John Garstang, Mortimer Wheeler, and Kathleen Kenyon among other archaeologists.

In a brief racing career which lasted from April to July 2008 he won three times from five starts. After finishing second on his debut he won a minor race before running unplaced in the Prix du Jockey Club. He then won the Prix du Lys and went on to record his biggest success with an impressive victory in the Grand Prix de Paris but never recovered from the race and was retired from the track. As a breeding stallion he had some success as a sire of National Hunt horses. Background Montmartre is a grey horse bred in France by Lagardere Elevage, a company which managed the bloodstock of the late Jean-Luc Lagard√®re. During his racing career he was owned by Aga Khan IV and trained by Alain de Royer-Dupr√©. He was ridden in all of his races by Christophe Soumillon. He was from the third crop of foals sired by Montjeu whose wins included the Prix du Jockey Club, Irish Derby, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. As a breeding stallion his other progeny included Motivator, Authorized, Pour Moi, Camelot, Scorpion, Masked Marvel, Hurricane Fly, St Nicholas Abbey and Hurricane Run. Montmartre's dam Artistique, from whom he inherited his grey colour, was a good staying filly who won the Prix Berteux in 1999. Artistique was a daughter of Armarama who won the Ribblesdale Stakes and was a half-sister to Kalaglow. Racing career 2008: three-year-old season Montmartre began his racing career in the Prix Juign√© over 2000 metres on heavy ground at Longchamp Racecourse on 6 April and finished second of the twelve runners, beaten a head by the √âlie Lellouche trained Magaden. Three weeks later at the same track he recorded his first success in a minor race over 2200 metres, beating Rock Fellow by three quarters of a length. The colt was the moved up sharply in class for the Group 1 Prix du Jockey Club over 2100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 1 June but made little impact and came home fifteenth of the twenty runners behind Vision d'Etat, beaten more than twenty lengths by the winner. Eighteen days after his failure at Chantilly Montmartre started the 1.5/1 favourite for the Group 3 Prix du Lys over 2400 metres at Longchamp. He took the lead 300 metres from the finish and won by two lengths and a short neck from Zack Dream and Watar. On 14 July he was one of thirteen colts to contest the Group 1 Grand Prix de Paris over 2400 metres at Longchamp. The British-trained Doctor Fremantle (winner of the Chester Vase and fourth in the Epsom Derby) started favourite with Montmartre next in the betting at odds of 4.5/1 alongside Prospect Wells (Prix Greffulhe) and Alessandro Volta (Lingfield Derby Trial). The other runners included Curtain Call (Beresford Stakes) Cima de Triomphe (Derby Italiano) and Americain. Montmartre settled in fourth place behind the pacemaker William Hogarth before moving up to take the lead 400 metres from the finish. He accelerated away from his rivals and despite being eased down by Soumillon he came home four lengths clear of the runner-up Prospect Wells. The Aga Khan's spokesman Damian Walker \\"It's the most impressive performance we have seen from a three-year-old colt this season and he has every chance of returning to Longchamp in October and winning the Arc\\". Montmartre was made the ante-post favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe after his win, but less than two weeks later his trainer Alain de Royer-Dupr√© explained that the colt's future plans were in doubt. He said \\"The Grand Prix was run in a very fast time and on very fast ground and the race has left its mark. He was very stiff after the race and it now all depends on how he recovers. For the moment, he is not sure to run in the Arc\\". In the 2008 World Thoroughbred Rankings Montmartre was given a rating of 125, making him the sixth-best racehorse in the world. Stud career Montmartre did not race again after his win in the Grand Prix and was retired to become a breeding stallion in France. In December 2014 he was put up for auction at the Arqana Breeding Stock Sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨180,000 by Meridian International. He had little success with his runners on the flat but has done better as a sire of jumpers. His offspring include Petite Parisenne (Spring Juvenile Hurdle), Labaik (Supreme Novices' Hurdle), Bigmartre (Future Champion Novices' Chase) and Titi de Montmartre. In 2018 he was based at the Haras du Hoguenet, Lessard-et-le-Ch√™ne, at a fee of ‚Ç¨6,500.

Set in a dystopian near-future of twisted prosaic settings, the collection of short stories explores themes surrounding black identity as it relates to a range of contemporary social issues. The book enjoyed an overall positive reception, including the naming of Adjei-Brenyah as one of the \\"5 Under 35 Authors\\" for 2018, by the National Book Foundation. Overview Friday Black takes its title from the consumer holiday Black Friday, which takes place in the US on the Friday following Thanksgiving. A collection of dystopian near-future short stories, the book's titular work follows its protagonist in the form of a department store salesman, as he copes with \\"vicious, insatiable Black Friday shoppers,\\" while attempting to win a sales contest among employees, in order to give the prize jacket to his mother as a gift. Alternatively the opening piece, \\"The Finkelstein 5\\", concerns Emmanuel, who can \\"dial his blackness\\" up or down depending on his situation: down to 1.5 for an interview with a prospective employer, comfortably at 4.0 with the aid of a necktie and wing- tipped shoes, and up to 10 when his sense of vengeance bursts forth over the killing of five black children by a chainsaw-wielding white man. The work continues to explore a range of topics, from issues of race in the United States criminal justice system, to the plight of a teenager working to support their family after their father's disappearance, school shootings, and \\"a dystopian Groundhog Day in which victims of an unexplained weapon relive a single day and resort to extreme violence to cope\\". In \\"Zimmer Land\\", the black protagonist struggles to change the narrative in a theme park where mostly white patrons savagely relish their racial prejudices under the guise of \\"problem-solving, judgement and justice,\\" while \\"The Era\\" presents a schoolboy's dilemmas in a post-apocalyptic society where self-confidence comes only through the use of drugs. Themes Adjei-Brenyah has said that as he set out to write what would eventually become his book Friday Black he sought to use a form of \\"magical realism\\" as a tool for exploring issues such as \\"race and the depravities of consumer culture and our collective habituation to violence.\\" Speaking to the Wall Street Journal Adjei-Brenyah reflected, > I like to work in that space where, \\"Is it hyperbole? I don't know.\\" When > you kill someone with a gun or a chainsaw, they're just as dead either way. > When I say 'chainsaw,' you have to pay attention. As the New York Times observed, these narratives take place in \\"prosaic settings\\", such as malls, hospitals or residential areas, but which are rendered \\"unfamiliar by adding a surreal, disorienting twist,\\" and employed in the exploration of contemporary issues such as abortion, racism, commercialism, and cyclical violence. Throughout, the book variously explores the theme of black experience, in a way that works primarily to inspire \\"empathy for the marginalized and the feared\\". Reception The book received generally favorable reviews. The review aggregator website Book Marks reported that 80% of critics gave the book a \\"rave\\" review, while the other 20% of the critics expressed \\"positive\\" impressions, based on a sample of 15 reviews. Publishers Weekly along with the New York Post listed Friday Black as one of the best books of the week. Buzzfeed and The Huffington Post both named it among the top releases of Fall 2018. The daily student newspaper The Harvard Crimson gave it 4.5 out of five stars, calling the book \\"an ingenious attack on American society.\\" Kirkus Reviews described the book as a work where \\"edgy humor and fierce imagery coexist ... with shrewd characterization and humane intelligence, inspired by volatile material sliced off the front pages,\\" while Newsday praised it as \\"caustically inventive\\", with a pervasive anger communicated through \\"nuance, grace and a probing empathy\\". Writer George Saunders dubbed the work as \\"an excitement and a wonder: strange, crazed, urgent and funny.\\" In response to Friday Black, the National Book Foundation named Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah among their \\"5 Under 35 Authors\\" for 2018, chosen by author Colson Whitehead. The book was included on the long list for the Andrew Carnegie Medals for Excellence in Fiction and Nonfiction. Friday Black is the recipient of the $75,000 2019 PEN/Jean Stein Book Award and shortlisted for the 2019 Dylan Thomas Prize.

It was first brought to public attention when the contamination at the site was noticed in 2010 by those monitoring the nearby Deepwater Horizon oil spill. A later report by the Associated Press in 2015 challenged the estimates of the extent of the leak given by the company and the U.S. Coast Guard, which were then revised to be around 1000 times greater than initially reported. Upper estimates of the spill have been calculated to be as much as of oil lost over the life of the disaster, affecting an area as large as . As of 2018, it was estimated that 300 to 700 barrels of oil per day are being spilled, making it one of the worst modern oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico by volume. The reserves are likely sufficient for the spill to continue for up to 100 years if it is not contained. Taylor Energy has spent as much as $435 million or more decommissioning the site. They contend that nothing further can be done to contain the spill, and that current observations of oil plumes in the area are the result of contaminated sediments, and not an active spill. This has been contradicted by the reports of non-profit groups, the press, and the government. Origin The Taylor Energy Mississippi Canyon 20 site was constructed in 1984, southeast of the Plaquemines-Balize delta. It consisted of a \\"fixed, 8-pile structure\\" in deep water, with 28 wells reaching reservoirs of depths of up to . In September 16, 2004, Hurricane Ivan passed within of the site, and caused submarine landslides that capsized the drill rig and moved it from its original location. This resulted in between 25 and 28 leaking wells being buried beneath the sea floor, approximately below the surface. Public awareness According to The Washington Post, although Taylor Energy reported the spill to the Coast Guard at the time, the Coast Guard \\"monitored the site for more than half a decade without making the public fully aware\\" of the severity of the leak. Increased attention later came in 2010, when observers monitoring the Deepwater Horizon oil spill discovered a persistent oil slick at the Taylor site. The Louisiana Environmental Action Network and several other conservationist organizations sued Taylor Energy in 2012, alleging that they, along with the federal government had withheld information from the public in a way that was \\"inconsistent with national policy\\", specifically a provision of the Clean Water Act, which mandates \\"public participation in the ... enforcement of any regulation\\". In 2015 the Associated Press conducted an investigation into the spill, and when provided with their results, the Coast Guard updated their leak estimates to one that was \\"about 20 times greater than one recently touted by the company\\". Additional information regarding the spill has been withheld by the company, with the approval of the government, in the \\"name of protecting trade secrets\\". As of 2018, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was three years behind a deadline for producing a study of the environmental impacts of the spill. In July 2018, the non-profit Earthjustice filed a lawsuit against NOAA for \\"failing to produce a timely study\\". As of 2018 no economic impact analysis of the spill had been conducted. Magnitude Oil sheen from the nearby Deepwater Horizon oil spill that occurred in 2010, when those monitoring the area observed similar contamination coming from the Taylor Energy site As of October 2018, it was estimated that between 300 and 700 barrels of oil per day were being spilled near the Taylor Energy site. In May 2019, the US Coast Guard installed a containment system that has been collecting 30 barrels per day. As of June 2019, a report by the National Center for Coastal Ocean Science estimated that the flow rate of oil leaking at the site was between 9 and 108 barrels per day. The resulting oil sheen was estimated in 2015 to cover . As of 2014, the sheen was approximately wide and long, with an average of wide and long. Estimates by the environmental non-profit group SkyTruth indicated that the spill may have emptied up to of oil as of 2015, making it the 8th largest spill in the Gulf of Mexico since 1970. Taylor Energy originally estimated the volume of the spill was in decline and was set to dwindle to around 12 gallons per day, but following an examination of 2,300 pollution reports by the Associated Press, the spill was shown to be dramatically increasing in both volume and area. According to Greenpeace and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), if not contained, the tapped reserves contain sufficient oil for the spill to continue for 100 years until they are depleted. According to a report from the U.S. Coast Guard, the leak represented a \\"significant threat\\" to the surrounding environment, although they did not find evidence that oil from the spill had reached the nearby shoreline. In documents submitted to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in 2015, Taylor Energy contended that \\"there is no evidence to suggest that any wells are leaking,\\" but that \\"small residual sheen persists as the result of soil contamination that cannot safely and feasibly be addressed.\\" However, the U.S. government reports concluded that \\"oil is most likely emanating from one or more of the 25 wells ... because the discharge volume is greater than can reasonably be accounted for by oil released from sediment only.\\" Containment efforts Taylor Energy entered an agreement in 2008 with the Minerals Management Service to decommission the site, and the Coast Guard established a dedicated multi-agency Unified Command structure to complete and oversee the work. Although the Minerals Management Service had ordered Taylor Energy to complete decommissioning by June 2008, they failed to do so, claiming \\"the technology needed to plug the wells at the site did not yet‚Äîand still does not‚Äîexist.\\" Because the wells were themselves buried under the sea floor by the landslides that destroyed their platform, traditional methods known as \\"plug and abandon\\" were not feasible. Examination of conditions on location indicated that dredging the sea floor for access to the wells, or drilling intervention wells for 17 of the 24 posed too high of a risk for safety and the environment. Taylor Energy reached an agreement with the federal government to establish a $666 million trust in order to fund the response to the spill according to The Washington Post. The Huffington Post reported that Taylor Energy has spent \\"tens of millions of dollars\\" in containment efforts. One other estimate put the price as of 2014 at $435 million in total spending by Taylor Energy on decommissioning. However, Taylor Energy contends that \\"nothing can be done to completely halt the chronic slicks.\\" According to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, collaborative efforts have resulted in removal of the platform deck, removal of subsea debris, decommissioning of the oil pipeline, and efforts to plug nine of the affected wells, but that despite these efforts, there is an ongoing oil discharge from the site. Containment efforts were disrupted by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, and although Taylor Energy has formulated plans to resolve the issue and presented these to federal regulators, the details were not released to the public. Taylor Energy sold its remaining oil assets in 2008, and as of 2015 had only a single employee. On October 23, 2018, one day after a Washington Post article exposing a decade of lax enforcement, the United States Coast Guard issued an order requiring cleanup of the site, blockage of the leaks, or face fines of $40,000 a day. On May 16, 2019, the United States Coast Guard reported that a containment system was working well enough to reduce the heavy surface sheen to barely visible.

The club is composed of four squads: Senior Women, Senior Men, Novice Women and Novice Men. It also runs sessions for university staff and the community. The boat club is a GB World Class Start center, and as of 2016 was the university's largest sports club, with over 200 members and a membership more than 50% female.'UYBC rowers do a marathon', iCrowdNewswire (28 October 2016).  History  The Boat Club was founded in October 1963 during the first month of activity of the newly established university. It was first hosted by York City Rowing Club which graciously allowed the students to use their equipment for no charge. In March 1965, the club entered its first competition: The Yorkshire Head of the River which took place in York. The Vice-Chancellor of the University, Lord James Rusholme suggested a boat race between the Lancaster University Boat Club and the University of York gave birth to the first Roses Boat Race was competed for the 15th of May 1965 and was won by York. This boat race has since evolved in the Roses tournament competed every year by the sports teams of both universities. The club attracted news coverage in 2008 when all members were struck with a sickness bug, prompting suspicions that the River Ouse was unsafe.Scott Armstrong, 'Probe after York river rowers are hit by mystery bug', York Press (26 May 2008). The club has at times also been involved in charity events, such as a 24-hour sponsored row (using rowing machines) in 2008.'24 hours rowing? But no boats!', York Press (20 May 2008). The club has also put in occasional appearances at the Henley Royal Regatta, for example in 2011 and 2017.Ian Appleyard, 'York City Rowing Club in victory at Henley Royal Regatta', York Press (28 June 2017).

It now races in black and gold even though the blue is still widely used throughout the club. The club's blade design is black with a white rose of york. The blazer of the club remains blue with white edging and bears the original crest of the club.  Races  The club partakes in various different races all around the academic year. Head Races such as Tyne Head, South Yorkshire Head, York Small Boats Head, BUCS Head. Regattas such as Durham Regatta, Henley Royal Regatta, Peterborough Regatta, York Summer Regatta or BUCS regatta. The club also used to have a race against York Saint John University Rowing Club, and traditionally run the White Rose Head, a three- kilometre head-to-head race from on the River Ouse, from the university boathouse and the Lowther pub.'University of York Boat Club to host White Rose Head race', York Press (4 December 2013).

He served as a page to Queen Anne of Denmark before becoming a Groom of the Bedchamber to James VI of Scotland. He moved to London with James in 1603 when the latter became King James I of England, becoming conduit for Scottish royal business at Whitehall. On 22 May 1605 he was granted Plumpton Park in Hesket in the Forest of Inglewood, then regarded as part of Debatable Lands between Scotland and England.

Biography  Martinat began his political career in the Italian Social Movement, holding positions both in the youth formations and in the Youth Front Secretariat and has been, during the 1970s, the organizer of the security services for Giorgio Almirante's meetings. In 1973, Martinat was elected to the central committee of the party and in 1979 he became a member of the national leadership, after being appointed provincial secretary of the MSI of Turin. Martinat has been uninterruptedly elected at the Chamber of Deputies from 1979 to 2001, first on the lists of the MSI, then in those of the National Alliance, of which he was a member of the national political office, and has been elected at the Senate in 2006 and 2008. He has been the enforcer of Giorgio Almirante and Gianfranco Fini in Piedmont and the reference man of the MSI in that region for over 30 years. In 1993, Martinat ran unsuccessfully for the office of Mayor of Turin. In 2001 he was appointed Deputy Minister of Infrastructures and Transports, working side by side with Minister Pietro Lunardi, in the Berlusconi II Cabinet and the following Berlusconi III Cabinet. In this role, he dealt, among other things, with the great works related to the preparation of the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics. Another theme that Martinat was interested in was the construction of the high-speed railway line between Turin and Lyon. In 2008, Martinat is appointed Undersecretary for Economic Development in the Berlusconi IV Cabinet and held that position until his death on 28 March 2009, at the age of 66, losing his battle against lung cancer.

Personal life  Ilse was born in Honnef am Rhein, Germany. She completed her school education in Berlin, then moving to G√∂ttingen and later to Bonn. She returned to Berlin in 1931, before moving to Munich in 1933. In 1935 she relocated to Britain in exile, where she lived until 1952 and taught biology in schools. Ilse then moved to Pune, India, where she remained until 1955. Her whereabouts from 1955 until her death in Munich in 1979 are unknown.  Career  Ilse received her PhD from the University of G√∂ttingen. From there she relocated to Bonn to work as a Scientific Assistant at the hereditary biological archive in Bonn. She returned to Berlin in 1931, as a Scientific Guest Researcher at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin Dahlem. She expected to move to Munich to work for the Munich Zoological Institute at the end of 1933, upon invitation by soon-to-be Nobel Prize-winner Karl von Frisch. However, the discriminatory law ‚ÄúOn the Restoration of the Civil Service,‚Äù of 7 April 1933 prevented her from doing so on account of her Jewish origins. Ilse instead took up a position as an assistant at the Zoological Institute, alongside which she undertook unpaid work producing educational films. In 1935 she moved in exile to Britain, where she lived until 1952, teaching biology in schools. She also published articles in Nature and Proceedings of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, and in 1938‚Äì39 gave a series of lectures in the United States of America, supplemented by her scientific films. Ilse resumed her activity as a zoologist between 1952 and 1955, at the University of Pune, India, where she helped to establish the Zoological Institute.  Research  Ilse studied aspects of animal behavior, including animal navigation, in butterflies. Her research had a particular focus on the great spangled fritillary (Argynnis aglaja). Through her observations, she noted butterflies' preference for blue, crimson, and violet flowers. Ilse's research proved that butterflies have a sense of color, and that most butterflies discover flowers on their first approach through their color and scent. Her experiments also showed that butterflies, like other insects, can be trained.

She came with the queen to England in 1603. When the court was at Winchester in September 1603 the queen ordered fabrics for new clothes for Hartsyde and other women who had made the journey from Scotland, including Anne Livingstone, Margaret Stewart, and Jean Drummond.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), pp. 123, 146 fn. 21. She subsequently married another royal servant called John Buchanan. One of her letters to Sir William Livingstone of Kilsyth described how Anne of Denmark was surprised by his leaving the court, and had expected him to deliver a jewel to her which he ought to send to queen as soon as possible. She was hoping to buy a house in Libberton in Lanarkshire with her husband.Archibald Constable, Memoirs of George Heriot (Edinburgh, 1822), pp. 207-209. Hartsyde handled large sums of money, and in 1606 paid the goldsmith George Heriot ¬£500 towards the queen's bill for jewels. In 1607 Heriot gave Hartsyde a ring worth ¬£30 for the queen, and wrote in his account that she had told him the purchase was \\"by her Majesty's direction\\", evidence that Hartsyde was trusted with the queen's business.Archibald Constable, Memoirs of George Heriot (Edinburgh, 1822), pp. 205, 207-8.

She was sent for trial in Edinburgh and convicted of \\"unlawful subracting and detening\\" in June 1608, even though she had signed a confession. She was not sentenced to death but banishment to Orkney was proposed. John Buchanan was found not guilty. The king's advocate Thomas Hamilton wrote to James VI saying that Hartsyde had the best lawyers in Edinburgh on her side, and thought that in clearing her of a charge of \\"theft\\", the assize had \\"very far mistaken their duty.\\" He recommended the king order her \\"to be declared infamous in all time coming\\" as \\"a restraint and terror to all other servants.\\"Melros Papers, vol. 1 (edinburgh, 1837), pp. 49-51.

Hartsyde and Buchanan went to Orkney and paid ¬£400 sterling for the value of the jewels.

The date of Margaret Hartsyde's death is unknown. Dorothy Silken, Piero Hugon, and Danish Anna Hartsyde's successor in the role of looking after the queen's silver in the bedchamber, was the Danish gentlewoman Dorothy Silken or Silking. She married Sir Edward Zouch of Woking in 1612. After an inventory of plate at Denmark House was made in 1621 they were asked to supply a shortfall worth ¬£493, including a gold casting bottle with the queen's arms. Zouch successfully claimed that a warrant signed by his wife was forgery, because she could not write her name.A. J. Collins, Jewels and Plate of Queen Elizabeth (London, 1955), pp. 149, 306. After Anne of Denmark's funeral in May 1619, two of her servants were accused of theft, her French page Piero or Pierre Hugon and a Danish maiden of honour called Anna. Piero had been \\"her creature and favourite\\", and according to a letter describing the queen's last days, \\"Pira, and the Dutch woman that serves her\\" had been her closest attendants, excluding other courtiers.Miscellany of the Abbotsford Club, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1837), p. 81 Anna may have been \\"Anna Kaas\\" who served the queen since her first days in Scotland.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 373. Hugon was a trusted courtier who travelled to the Danish court for Anne in 1618.Acts of the Rivy Council: 1618-1619 (London, 1929), p. 57. The theft was discovered by the goldsmith who supplied some of the items, either William Herrick or George Heriot.Maureen M. Meikle & Helen M. Payne, 'From Lutheranism to Catholicism: The Faith of Anna of Denmark (1574-1619)', Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 64:1 (2013), p. 66 citing Thomas Birch & Folkestone Williams, Court and Times of James the First, vol. 2 (London, 1849), p. 167, and Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 240. Anna and Piero were taken to the Tower of London and charged with stealing jewels worth ¬£30,000.Norman McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 240: Jemma Field, 'Anna of Denmark and the Politics of Religious Identity' in Northern Studies, vol. 50 (2019), p. 107. James Howell heard rumours and wrote, \\"Q. Anne left a world of brave jewels behind, but one Piero, an outlandish man, who had the keeping of them, embezelled many, and is run away.\\"Joseph Jacobs, Epistolae Ho-Elianae: the familiar letters of James Howell, vol. 1 (London, 1892), p. 105. The French ambassador Fran√ßois de Bassompierre, Count of Tilli√®res, tried to help Hugon. A draft letter answering Tilli√®res gives more detail of the accusations. King James gave a chest in Paris taken from Hugon to Mr Herbert, a brother of Sir Edward Herbert his ambassador in France, compensating Hugon with ¬£500. The missing jewels were worth ¬£60,000. Hugon was also accused of sending the queen's money and some religious items after her death to a nunnery and to some Jesuits to pray for her soul. These accusations were not sent to Tilli√®res, after Hugon was interrogated in the Tower and he made a deal or bargain.Historical Manuscripts Commission, 10th Report: Report on the Manuscripts of C S H Drummond Moray (London, 1885), pp. 113-4, this letter is now in National Archives of Scotland GD24/1/825. Herbert discovered that the brother of Louis Richard, one of the queen's musicians, had carried packages to France for Hugon. Herbert made an inventory of two chests belonging to Hugon, and the contents were thought to include some of the queen's jewels.Sidney Lee, The Autobiography of Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1886), p. 343. He was concerned by various Catholic items he saw . There were many items of jewelry and costume, two bezoar stones, and a string of pearls with Hugon's note that Anne of Denmark had given them to him on his wedding day with a large diamond, and the pearls should be sold and the proceeds used to say Masses for the queen. Marie de' Medici became involved, who declared via Pierre Br√ªlart, marquis de Sillery, Viscount Puisieux, that she had always been well-disposed to the service of the late queen. Puisieux believed that Hugon was detained in England by the Spanish-favouring faction at court.Morris Charles Jones, 'Old Herbert Papers at Powis Castle and the British Museum: Inventory of things found in the two trunks of Pierre Hugon', Collections Historical and Archeological Relating to Montgomeryshire and Its Borders, vol. 20 (London, 1886), pp. 100-1, 106, 226-7, 230-2, 242, 247-9, 251, the inventory is now British Library MS Add. 7082, ff. 46-54. Maureen Meikle and Helen Payne propose that Hugon had become a significant figure in the queen's household after the departure of Jean Drummond, Countess of Roxburghe. Assuming that many or most of the items in the inventory had belonged to the queen, including Catholic items, they suggest that Anne of Denmark had asked him to take them away to prevent their discovery, although the result was the exact opposite, and that Hugon 's confession that money was intended to found a monastery in France ought to be taken as evidence for the queen's Catholic faith.Maureen M. Meikle & Helen M. Payne, 'From Lutheranism to Catholicism: The Faith of Anna of Denmark (1574-1619)', Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 64:1 (2013), pp. 66-9, for a letter describing Hugon's confession, see, TNA SP14/110/10. Anne of Denmark had lost jewelry to thieves before. When she came to Scotland in 1590 she brought a German goldsmith called Jacob Kroger. In 1594 Kroger stole some of her jewels and fled to England with a French stable servant called Guillaume Martyn. They were captured by George Selby, imprisoned in Tynemouth Castle, returned to Edinburgh and executed.HMC 6th Report: Northumberland (London, 1877), p. 232.

Early life and education  Torres was born on 7 May 1982 in Chihuahua City, Chihuahua, and graduated from Mechanical Engineering at the Chihuahua Institute of Technology. He worked for eight years in project management of a maquiladora of medical equipment in Chihuahua.  Career  Torres first gained notoriety during the 2012 Mexican general election, after he wrote a tweet about a proposal by one of the then-presidential candidates, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, which was retweeted by another presidential candidate, Gabriel Quadri. This led him to be offered the opportunity to write columns for a blog and a weekly newspaper in Mexico City. After spending some time in the capital, he realized he would rather reach younger and more tech- savvy audiences through a YouTube series, featuring humor with a prominent theme of political satire, focusing on Latin America, specifically Mexico. He says that he will never move to mainstream television channels to keep his fan base and to prevent being called a \\"sell out\\". Torres says he will not report on stories about drug lords out of fear of lawsuits or murder. He hosted the 2017 MTV Millennial Awards.

Kreneck, published by Texas A&M; University Press, discussing Houston restaurateur Felix Tijerina. Paul H. Carlson of Texas Tech University described the book as a \\"sympathetic portrait\\",Carlson, p. 854. and that Kreneck had a \\"sense of admiration\\" for Tijerina.Carlson, p. 855. Mary Kelley of Lamar University described the book as \\"primarily an admiring biography of the public of Felix Tijerina\\".Kelley, p. 346. Background Kreneck is the director of the Texas A&M; University Corpus Christi Special Collections and Archives, and had served as the Houston Metropolitan Research Center's Mexican American Archives director. In his latter role he organized Tijerina's archival collection. Kreneck conducted research for this book for around twenty years, which involved using archives such as the HMRC Tijerina archives, as well as interviewing people who knew Tijerina.Garc√≠a, p. 1568. Contents Mario T. Garc√≠a of University of California, Santa Barbara stated that Mexican American Odyssey is \\"clearly favorable to Tijerina\\" but discusses \\"some of Tijerina's shortcomings\\"; Garc√≠a cited Tijerina discriminating against black people in his restaurants and supporting other Jim Crow features of segregation-era Houston.Garc√≠a, p. 1568-1569. In her review Kelley stated that the perception of Tijerina being an \\"appeaser\\" to said \\"racial discrimination\\", even though he was a part of LULAC, was an example of the \\"shortcomings\\" covered in the book. Christine Marin of Arizona State University noted in her review that Tijerina had politically conservative views and in regards to the NAACP had \\"cool feelings\\".Marin, p. 81. The book discusses Tijerina's biography, LULAC, and the growth of the ethnic Mexican population of Houston. Due to the latter, Garc√≠a described it as being both a \\"collective\\" and an \\"individual\\" biographical work. Kelley stated that the book's emphasis on \\"human agency\\" instead of anti-Mexican discrimination and Tijerina's emphasis on biculturalism were elements of the book Reception Carlson praised it as \\"soundly researched\\" and \\"engaging\\", stating it was a \\"good book\\". Garna L. Christian of University of Houston-Downtown wrote that the book \\"contributed greatly to our knowledge of local, ethnic, and business history, as well as\\" that about Tijerina himself; Christian stated \\"one might wish for more of the personal side of Felix Tijerina that is occasionally glimpsed in passages from his correspondence\\".Christian, p. 220. Garc√≠a stated that the book is \\"an important piece of work\\", and a \\"solid biography\\", and that he \\"enjoyed\\" and \\"learned much from\\" it.Garc√≠a, p. 1569. Garc√≠a stated that \\"at times it reads too much as an extended vita in which the author felt compelled to cover every single activity that Tijerina participated in, both in Houston and elsewhere.\\" Kelley stated that Mexican American Odyssey \\"is a welcome addition to a growing body of Mexican American history\\" and \\"an important contribution to understanding\\" the rise of Mexican Americans in Houston and the history of the city's Hispanic population. Marin stated \\"Overall, this is an important book.\\"Marin, p. 82. Marin criticized how there was \\"a mass of details\\" stemming from \\"attempts to paint a glowing picture of\\" Tijerina, which would result in someone becoming \\"bogged down trying to keep up with it all.\\" See also * History of the Mexican Americans in Houston Notes and references Notes References   * Category:Books about Houston Category:2001 non-fiction books Category:Texas A&M; University Press books ","title":"Mexican American Odyssey"},{"id":"58848276","text":"Joseph Anthony O'Meara (24 June 1943 - 4 May 2001) was an Irish first-class cricketer and field hockey international.

Introduced in the 2013 model year, the car was entirely redesigned and included features such as an Anti-lock Braking System, electronic stability control and traction control that made the car compatible to modern vehicle safety standards. The discontinuation of production of the VX I in August 2017 marked the culmination of the Viper sports car.  History and development  SRT Viper TA At a dealer conference on September 14, 2010 in Orlando, Florida, the then Chrysler Group and Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne was reported to have concluded his remarks by unveiling a rolling 2012 Dodge Viper prototype. There would be cars produced for the 2011 model year. In Autumn of 2011, Ralph Gilles announced that the next generation of the Viper would debut at the New York Auto Show in April 2012. At the 2013 New York International Auto Show, the all new SRT Viper GTS was unveiled along with plans to enter the car into racing as well. As part of Chrysler's plan of turning Street and Racing Technology (SRT) as a separate vehicle brand within Chrysler Group LLC, the SRT Viper became the brand's halo vehicle. In May 2014, the SRT brand was re- consolidated under Dodge, with former SRT CEO Ralph Gilles continuing as senior vice president of product design and also as the CEO and president of Motorsports. The car was renamed back to Dodge Viper in 2015.  Specifications  SRT offered two versions of the Viper; the SRT Viper and the GTS. The GTS is the premium model offering more creature comforts over the base model. The most notable exterior difference between the two models is the hood. The base model has six functional hood vents while the GTS model only has two. To commemorate the return of the Viper, SRT offered a 'launch edition' package available on 150 GTS models in 2013. All of the launch edition cars were painted in Viper Blue with twin white stripes and came with a serialized dash plaque placed inside their cabins. The interior of the launch edition cars was swathed in Black Laguna leather with contrast stitching. The SRT Viper GTS includes leather upholstery, accented colors on the seats, doors, center console and stitching; gun metal trim on the cluster bezel, HVAC outlets, window switch bezels, shifter base, park brake bezel and the integrated passenger grab handle on the center console; Sabelt racing seats with Kevlar and fiberglass shell, carbon-fiber hood, roof, decklid and aluminum door panels, split six-spoke forged aluminum \\"Venom\\" wheels with polished face and graphite-painted pockets (standard), fully painted Hyper Black or fully painted low-gloss black finished wheels. The SRT Viper features a cruise control and controls on the steering wheel. UConnect Bluetooth phone with Bluetooth Audio streaming is standard, as is an 8.4-inch touch screen display like that found on the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, and Dodge Journey. It also features an Alpine surround sound system and many exterior, interior, and wheel combinations. There is also a four-inch reconfigurable Thin-Film Transistor display in the gauge cluster to display important vehicle information, system messages, and has controls to turn the traction control, stability control, and other features off. It also has a \\"Track Mode\\" with a built-in track timer, \\"stoplight\\" countdown timer display, and other features. Power seats, keyless entry, and heated seats are also new options. A navigation system by Garmin was also an available option, as were the Sirius- XM satellite radio and HD radio. A built-in HDD for storing music and photos JPEG and MP3 was also included as standard equipment. The optional SRT Track Package includes Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires, StopTech slotted two-piece brake rotors and ultra-lightweight wheels in Hyper Black or matte black finishes. Dodge introduced a new GT package in 2015 to fill the gap between the base Viper and the GTS model. GT buyers got the two-mode, driver-adjustable suspension and five-mode electronic stability control system from the GTS, along with Nappa leather seats with Alcantara accents and contrast stitching.  Performance  The Viper (VX I) is powered by an all-aluminium V10 engine. The engine initially generated at 6,150 rpm and of torque at 4,950 rpm but in 2015, power was raised by 5 hp for a total of . The Viper could accelerate from in 3.5 seconds and could attain a top speed of .  Variants  ACR At SEMA 2014, Dodge presented a Viper ACR concept car based on the new VX I platform. The car was eventually introduced in 2015 for the 2016 model year. The base price of the 2016 ACR was US$121,395 in the United States and CA$159,995 in Canada. The 2016 Viper ACR came installed with an all-new aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber, that included a new front splitter and a fixed carbon fiber rear wing, altogether producing a total of of downforce at corners. The Viper V10 engine generated the same power output at 6,200 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm as in all other Viper trims. The brakes were from Brembo, with discs and calipers built specifically for the car. The discs were now carbon ceramic, a first for the Viper series. The braking system contains discs with 6-piston calipers up front, and discs with 4-piston calipers down the rear. The tires were from Kumho, using a set of tires called the Kumho Ecsta V720 ACR, a variant of the V720 specifically built for the ACR. The front tires are P295/25R19Z, slightly smaller than the regular Viper, and P355/30R19Z at the rear. Suspension system is manufactured by Bilstein, which has 10 settings for rebound and compression tuning for the dampers. The options for the car are very diverse, like all of the other Viper trims. One example is the ACR Extreme Aero Package, which was the same package used to help the car break a total of 13 track lap records. The package included the addition of a removable extended front splitter extension, a new adjustable dual-element rear wing, four dive planes, six removable diffuser strakes, removable brake ducts, and removable hood louvers, and if removed, will reveal a hood gap. This helped the car produce an extra of downforce at corners, for a total of . With this package, the top speed was reduced at only instead of because of the massive downforce produced by the car. At top speed, the car produces of downforce, the most of any production car. TA The Time Attack (TA) model was introduced in 2013 and had two variants, 1.0 and 2.0, each variant different from the other. The 1.0 was sold by SRT and was made as a small enhancement for the Viper GTS. The engine received no modifications and was rated at and , the same as the standard car, but the top speed dropped to because of the car's aerodynamic additions.2014 SRT Viper TA First Drive ‚Äì Review ‚Äì Car and Driver: 2014 SRT Viper TA First Drive ‚Äì Review ‚Äì Car and Driver, accessdate: 20. tammikuuta 2016 The car now had the addition of the Advanced Aerodynamic Package (two-piece front corner splitters and a rear decklid spoiler made from carbon fiber), lightweight Sidewinder II wheels finished in matte-black, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires, two-mode (Street and Race) Bilstein DampTronic suspension adapted from the GTS, but with firmer levels of damping and a smaller spread between modes, shock dampers, increased spring rates and thicker anti-roll bars, carbon fiber underhood X-brace (instead of the aluminium brace in all other models), carbon fiber rear tail light applique from the Exterior Carbon Fiber Accent Package, two-piece Brembo brake rotors with wider brake annulus, black-anodized Brembo brake calipers painted with the Viper logo in TA Orange, TA logos behind both front wheels and a Stryker decal instead of the standard badge on the hood (TA Orange on the Venom Black cars, black on the TA Orange and Venom White cars), black interior with TA Orange accent stitching on the ballistic cloth seats, instrument panel & cowl, center stack, console, hand brake, shifter boot, and door panels. The aerodynamic package adds of downforce at . On March 18, 2013 MotorTrend tested the SRT Viper TA in Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, setting the production car lap record in 1:33.62, besting the previous lap time holder Chevrolet Corvette ZR1's 1:33.70 lap time. The TA edition returned for the 2015 model year and was called the TA 2.0 (but the TA 1.0 was still available up to and including the last model year, 2017). This model was sold by Dodge. The 2.0 part of the moniker refers to the updated aero package, which incorporates a bigger rear wing, new front dive planes, and a new carbon-fiber front splitter. The package improves downforce to 400 pounds at 150 mph versus the 2014 Viper TA's 278 pounds at 150 mph. The internal parts had also been improved, with an improved suspension setup, new two-piece Brembo rotors, and improved shocks, dampers, springs, and stabilizer bars. The car also has an improved X-brace. The car's power output also stayed the same like the 1.0. However, the data was based on the Dodge version of the Viper, not the SRT version. Unlike the 1.0, the 2.0 retained the top speed of the standard car. The car's mileage was improved in the 2.0 version, with 13 mpg in city, and 20 mpg on the highway. GTC The GTC model was introduced in 2015, and had a customization program that offered 8,000 colors and 24,000 hand-painted stripes, 10 wheel choices, 16 interior trims, 6 aero options, and an undisclosed amount of standalone options to choose from. There were a total of 25 million possible build combinations. Ordering a GTC enrolled a customer in a unique VIP program called Viper Concierge, which according to Dodge, \\"offers an exclusive point of contact throughout the custom Viper build process.\\" The Concierge process started with the ordering stage, which included Dodge sending customers a paint chip confirming the owner's choice. Shortly thereafter, Dodge sent buyers a 1:18-scale \\"speed-form\\" replica in their chosen custom colors, to confirm or deny the build. Once the buyer's color and option selection was locked-in, that car became a one-of-one Viper for that year ‚Äì no other buyer would be permitted to build a Viper to the same specifications.  Lap records  In October 2015, the ACR gained a 7:01.67 laptime at the N√ºrburgring Nordscheleife with the Extreme Aero Package, which was run by SRT, and lapped by their test driver Dominik Farnbacher. Unfortunately, the lap was unofficial according to SRT. A crowdfund attempt started by volunteer Russ Oasis in 2017 on the GoFundMe funding platform began collecting funds to reclaim the lap record on the N√ºrburgring. Crowdfunding ended up being as high as $198,000. He eventually found himself supported by 377 people, and sponsorship and assistance from Kumho Tire (tire supplier), Prefix Performance (formally known as Arrow Performance) (logistics and parts supplier), ViperExchange (car loaners), and Fox Pro Films (lap filming). SRT test driver, racing driver, and former N√ºrburgring record holder Dominik Farnbacher returned to the track to help the group retake the record. Racing drivers Luca Stolz, Mario Farnbacher, and Lance David Arnold came in as well. Their target was the second position in street legal vehicles category. The Lamborghini Hurac√°n Performante holding the position at that time had a lap time of 6:52.01. The group went through three attempts, with the lap times of 7:03.45 (set by Dominik Farnbacher), 7:03.23 (set by Mario Farnbacher), and 7:01.30 (set by Lance David Arnold), respectively. Their three-day trip to N√ºrburg, Germany ended with a crashed Viper ACR. Despite the failure of surpassing the Hurac√°n Performante, the team was still able to make the Viper ACR the fastest American, rear-wheel driven (with no additional assistance), and manual transmission equipped car to go around the track. Their lap time also brought the car to fifth position for street legal vehicles in 2017.  Production  Sales of the Viper in 2013 and 2014 was poor. Production was reduced by 1/3 in October, 2013 and then halted for two months in April, 2014 amid slow sales. In October 2015, Fiat Chrysler group announced that the Viper would end production in 2017. Initially, Fiat Chrysler cited poor sales as a reason for discontinuing the Viper; however, other sources have stated the car was discontinued because the Viper was unable to comply with FMVSS 226 safety regulation, which requires side curtain air bags. In July 2017, Fiat Chrysler announced they would be permanently closing the Conner Assembly Plant on August 31, 2017. Chrysler announced five special edition Vipers for the final model year of production.

History  The construction of the 2000 Commonwealth Avenue building began in autumn 1969. The building that collapsed was to have contained 133 condominium apartments. The collapse occurred the day before the building's scheduled \\"top out\\" day.Pletcher, p. 177.  Collapse  The building collapsed while concrete was being poured on the top floor of the building. Two-thirds of the building was destroyed by a progressive collapse. Approximately 100 men were working in or around the building. A difficult and dangerous search by rescue workers, involving days of digging, led to the recovery from the building's basement of the bodies of the four workers who died in the collapse. The search was postponed for 36 hours while the Boston building commissioner and other experts confirmed the stability of the remaining structure, a delay that angered the coworkers and family members of the missing men. The four workers killed were: *Ciraco DiIorio, 45, laborer, from Roslindale, Boston, Massachusetts *Michael Papasedero, 27, foreman, from Dedham, Massachusetts *Daniel Tintindo, 41, welder, from Mansfield, Massachusetts *James Cingolani, 26, Tintindo's helper, from Quincy, Massachusetts Papasedero was last seen after the collapse had begun entering the basement garage, where Tintindo and Cingolani, members of his crew, had been working, to search for them.  Cause  Contributory causes of the collapse included lack of quality control and inspections, concrete weakened when left unprotected from cold weather, deficiencies in shoring and reinforcing bars and overly high construction loads on the roof slab. A commission of inquiry concluded that the primary causes of the collapse were lack of shoring and low concrete strength. On July 23, 1972, Controlled Demolition, Inc., imploded the unfinished building after the completion of the recovery effort.

A. G., A. A. Goddard, A. G. A.) was a 19th-century New England woman best known for her work as an editor and author as well as for her role as a nurse during the American Civil War.Abba Ann Goddard Lowell Offering In 1834, Goddard and her husband, Rutherford, moved to Lowell, Massachusetts. There, she worked in mills with other young female textile workers who are most commonly referred to as the Lowell Mill Girls. Goddard was both an author and editor for the Lowell Offering. In series 2 Volume 5 of the Offering, published in 1845, a list of authors compiled by contributor Harriet Hanson Robinson features Goddard along with two of her pen names (A. A. G. and A. G. A.). A similar list is found in Robinson's book Massachusetts in the Woman Suffrage Movement: A General, Political, Legal and Legislative History from 1774, to 1881 regarding women's suffrage in Massachusetts. The works featured in the Offering covered a broad range of topics; it was widely read by many of the Lowell Mill Girls. The Trojan Sketchbook In 1846, Abba Goddard contributed to a compilation of poetry, essays, and short stories titled The Trojan Sketchbook, written by citizens of Troy, New York, and published by Young and Hartt. It describes the history of the city and nearby areas, as told by its citizens. Goddard was both the editor of the collection and the author of an essay titled \\"Legend of the Poestenkill,\\" referencing the neighboring town of Poestenkill, New York. \\"Legend of the Poestenkill\\" tells the story of the relationship between the Mohawk people who are indigenous to Poestenkill, New York and the Dutch people who settled there. The tale begins with the Dutch settlers creating a new settlement farther up the Hudson River. The white settlers and the native people develop an amicable relationship and coexist peacefully in the region. A Mohawk man named Dekanisora develops feelings for a Dutch woman named Elsie Vaughn, who is described as being \\"too good to excite the envy of her own sex, and too beautiful to be overlooked, or neglected, by the other.\\" When Dekanisora professes his love, he is rejected, but still harbors his feelings in secrecy. One day, Elsie goes on a walk and Dekanisora follows her; when Elsie falls asleep and is attacked by a vicious serpent, Dekanisora saves her life. Once again, he professes his love to her, promising that she can become the queen of the Mohawk people. Repulsed by his behavior, Elsie throws herself from a cliff and dies and her body is discovered many years later by vacationing men. Civil War During the American Civil War, Goddard aided her country by writing about the war and serving as a nurse for wounded soldiers. She lived in Portland, Maine during this period and wrote for its newspaper, informing citizens of the soldiers' situations. She encouraged them to take initiative and support the troops in whatever way they could. Taking her own advice to heart, Goddard travelled over 600 miles so she could aid the soldiers from Portland, Maine, who were a part of the 10th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment. She knew that there would be many wounded and dying men who would direly need her assistance. She had much sympathy for these soldiers, many of whom were living in miserable conditions if they were not wounded or killed. She helped gather donations for the soldiers and served as a volunteer female nurse along with many other civilian nurses and volunteers.

Wainwright made the song available for purchase after a premiere performance on The Late Late Show with James Corden on October 18, with a portion of proceeds benefiting voter registration efforts. The song's music video, directed by Andrew Ondrejcak, features Wainwright as Dionysius II of Syracuse and Darren Criss as Damocles. Development and composition Wainwright wrote the song after hearing Carrie Fisher (pictured in 2013) use the anecdote \\"the Sword of Damocles\\" in conversation. Richard Westall's Sword of Damocles (1812) depicts Dionysius II of Syracuse drawing Damocles's attention to the sword hanging above him; similar imagery is seen in the song's music video. \\"Sword of Damocles\\", written by Wainwright around the United States presidential election in 2016, alludes to the story of Damocles and the perils faced by those in positions of power. Wainwright developed the song after hearing his friend Carrie Fisher use the anecdote \\"the Sword of Damocles\\" in conversation to describe her \\"troubled state of mind\\". The singer recalled, \\"I had no idea what [Carrie] was referring to, but it rang into one ear and didn't leave the other one. It was just stuck in my head. And it became this uneasy thread that I started writing about. It wasn't even about politics at the time, more about this gnawing feeling that something was occurring.\\" Following the 2016 election, Wainwright researched the story of Damocles and finished writing the song. He recorded \\"Sword of Damocles\\" in 2017, and started performing the song at concerts. Wainwright released the song in 2018, prior to the mid-term elections, to encourage people to vote. He described the song as his \\"artistic response to what [he sees] currently transpiring within the American government and how its collapse is affecting every aspect of existence for us all\\". Furthermore, Wainwright said in a statement: The song's lyrics, which are critical of President Donald Trump, were described as \\"doomy\\" by Brooke Bajgrowicz of Billboard. The music magazine's Nicole Engelman called \\"Sword of Damocles\\" as a \\"swelling\\" piano ballad \\"[dripping] in political satire.\\" Rolling Stone Ryan Reed described the song as a ballad in which Wainwright \\"croons over stately piano chords\\". Colin Bertram of Bloomberg.com called the song a \\"political anthem\\". Release and promotion Wainwright debuted the song on The Late Late Show with James Corden on October 18, 2018. He was accompanied by a pianist and illuminated by purple lights. According to Bajgrowicz, Wainwright's performance \\"instantly captivat[ed] the audience\\". The studio version of \\"Sword of Damocles\\" was first made available on Bandcamp, with some proceeds benefitting voter registration efforts via the progressive political group Swing Left. Music video The song's music video features Darren Criss (pictured in 2012) as Damocles. The song's music video, released on October 30, was directed by Andrew Ondrejcak and features Wainwright as Dionysius II of Syracuse and Darren Criss portraying Damocles. Trump is not referenced directly, but the introduction displays the text: \\"Dear Mr. President, This ancient story, from the 4th century, reminds me of you. Love, Rufus\\". Then, text describes the story of Damocles: The two men sit at opposite ends of a table, and Dionysius is showered with fortunes before he shares them with Damocles. The background visuals become increasingly \\"absurd\\" as the fortunes are transferred; among the colorful effects are golden orbs and a maggot-infested hamburger. Damocles is shown with a sword hovering above his head, and the video ends with the text \\"Vote.\\" Wainwright and Criss wore costumes designed by Vivienne Westwood. Reed described the music video as \\"experimental\\". Wainwright said of its simplicity, \\"I think if I had gone out being really overwrought politically, it doesn't hit the mark. You're speaking to the converted at this point. America is so divided now that any message shot across the bow has to be put within a larger context... In the end we are all the king, and we all have this sword above our heads that is about to fall.\\" Reception American Songwriter Brianna Goebel called the song \\"heartfelt\\" and the music video \\"compelling\\". Reed described \\"Sword of Damocles\\" as \\"artful\\" and \\"ornate\\".

It was founded in 1951 as the Women's Hospital, and is operated by the Ministry of Public Health's Department of Medical Services. With an inpatient capacity of 1,200 beds, it is one of the largest hospitals in Thailand. It serves as a teaching hospital for the College of Medicine, Rangsit University.  History  Rajavithi Hospital was founded as the Women's Hospital under the premiership of Plaek Phibunsongkhram, as part of his policy to establish large medical centres in Bangkok. Construction began in 1947, undertaken by the Department of Civil Engineering. The original buildings, designed in modified International Style, included an administration and outpatient building, a surgery and labour building, two patient wards, and staff residences. The hospital was officially opened on 16 April 1951, becoming the country's first specialized hospital for women's health. One of the hospital's pioneers was Dr Sem Pringpuangkeo, who was director from 1951 to 1963 and oversaw the successful separation of conjoined twins Wandee and Sriwan, the country's first such case, in 1956. He also founded the next-door Children's Hospital, in 1954. The hospital gradually diversified its patient services, adding surgery, internal medicine, and otolaryngology departments. But obstetrics for a long time remained the hospital's core service, seeing as many as 30,000 births yearly during 1960‚Äì1964. In 1976, the hospital changed its policies to provide general healthcare as well and was renamed Rajavithi Hospital, a name conferred upon by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. In 1988, the hospital opened its heart centre and was the first in Asia to successfully operate a heart transplant using the 'Domino' procedure. Rajavithi Hospital started providing medical education for students of the College of Medicine, Rangsit University since 1 June 1992. Students in this group also study at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health as a teaching hospital. Services Rajavithi Hospital serves as the Department of Medical Services' largest tertiary referral centre, and is a major organ transplant facility. It also operates a large trauma unit, and its Narenthorn EMS Center, established in 1995, was the country's first emergency medical service provider. The hospital has about 250 medical doctors on staff, has 1,200 inpatient beds, and treats up to 1 million outpatients annually.

He wrote them in exile in Paris in 1833/34. They were initially published in French, titled De l'Allemagne depuis Luther (Germany after Luther), in the magazine Revue des deux Mondes in 1834. The first publication in German was as part of Der Salon. Zweiter Band the same year. Heine hoped for a revolution in Germany and looked at a history of emancipation in that country, beginning with the Reformation and followed by the philosophy of Kant and Hegel, among others.  History  Heinrich Heine wrote the essay in exile in Paris in 1833/34, following the French July Revolution of 1830 and the German Hambach Festival of 1832. As it was being completed, Heine's German text was successively translated into French. The French text was published in three parts as De l'Allemagne depuis Luther (Germany after Luther) in the magazine Revue des deux Mondes in March, November and December 1834. The first publication in German was in the second volume of the literary magazine Der Salon (Der Salon. Zweiter Band) in 1834. Heine wrote in a preface for the German publication, dated December 1834, about the origins of the work, of the problems of the partitioned French publication, and of his intentions to present an overview of developments in German thinking, or mind processes (\\"√úberschau deutscher Geistesvorg√§nge\\").  Content  Heine addressed the French Revolution, missing a similar development in Germany. Stylistically, he often used contradictions in a dialectic way, citing the pairs \\"K√∂rper/Geist\\" (body/mind) and sensualism/spiritualism, the latter in the meaning of his time. Heine criticises the philosophy of German idealism as thorough and deep but incomprehensible. His work is written in popular style, aiming at emancipation.  First book  Heine saw the Protestant Reformation as a first step to overcoming an effort to suppress the body in humans, aiming instead for the peace of body and soul (\\"Friede zwischen Leib und Seele\\"). He notes Martin Luther's denouncement of celibacy and his translation of the Bible as a means to make the book accessible for everyone and at the same time create a common German language. Heine called Luther's hymn \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\" (\\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\\") the Marseillaise of the Reformation.  Second book  While Heine saw a religious revolution mainly as the work of one person, he regarded a \\"philosophical revolution\\" to be the result of thinkers such as Ren√© Descartes, Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. They, and also John Locke, Leibniz, Spinoza and Lessing, form \\"geistige Familienbande\\" (spiritual family ties) that work, sometimes in contradiction, towards an improvement of philosophy. Heine distinguished between idealism, a theory of ideas, and materialism, which is derived from sensual experience. He opposed terms such as spiritualism and sensualism as polemic. He preferred pantheism to both a Christian and Jewish personal God and the atheism of the French Revolution, saying \\"Gott ist alles, was da ist\\" (God is everything that exists).  Third book  Heine appreciated Kant's philosophy, summarising: \\"Kant bewies uns, da√ü wir von den Dingen, wie sie an und f√ºr sich selber sind, nichts wissen, sondern da√ü wir nur in so fern etwas von ihnen wissen, als sie sich in unserem Geiste reflektiren\\" (Kant proved to us that we know nothing of the things as they are, but only know of them as they are reflected in our mind). He saw a \\"Versp√§tung\\" (delay) of the Germans in European history but expected nonetheless that a revolution would happen in Germany, late but forcefully.  Legacy  Der Salon. Zweiter Band did not sell well, but the publication resulted in several bans in Prussia, Hamburg and Austria. Klemens Wenzel Lothar von Metternich, however, recommended the book as quintessential and in good style. The book foreshadows thoughts which later became topics of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud and Walter Benjamin, among others.

Plot In Hong Kong, a crime syndicate has cornered and ultimately shot down Toru Hinoharu, the heir to a major business corporation. Meanwhile, in Texas, we learn that there is another man who looks exactly like the late Toru, a cowboy named Joji Hibiki. When Joji learns his father is on his deathbed, his father reveals the truth about him. Given a letter, Joji learns that Mr. Hibiki had kidnapped Joji as a young boy due to his aspirations on trying to be wealthy in Japan. However, over the eighteen years, Hibiki actually thought of Joji as a son. Hibiki writes that Joji has a twin brother and sister and had read in a Japanese newspaper that his twin brother (Toru) was killed in Hong Kong. Joji heads to Japan to learn the truth about who he is. Upon his arrival in Kobe, Joji meets a man who attempts to pickpocket him. While the man successfully steals his wallet, Joji's insistence to take him to the old Hinoharu place allows the thief to take him there. When Joji arrives with his monkey Peter, Peter steals a top from a bikini clad woman, prompting the woman and her friends to confront Joji. When Joji attempts to say it was a mistake, the girls call for the hulking Spartacus, whose futile attempts to catch Joji eventually gives the duo a level of respect. Meanwhile, someone has recognized Joji and mistakes him for the dead Toru. That night, Joji finds the pickpocket and confronts him and his friends. However, the group soon earn Joji's respect and they become friends. Ikeda Hinokaru has learned about Joji and takes him in. Joji meets his sister Chihiro, who has been blind since the age of nine. At first thinking Joji is Toru, Joji reveals his true identity and Chihiro is relieved to hear she has another brother. To celebrate Joji's return, Ikeda gives Joji a chance to see Chihiro demonstrate her martial arts skills. While she is blinded, she uses the power of sound and the wind to find her attackers. That night, the family heads to a show performed by ventriloquist \\"Mr. Magic\\", who through his puppet, tells Joji that his uncle may not be who he is seen to be. When the group returns him, Joji overhears a conversation with Ikeda and the father of Reika, one of his new friends. Joji learns his uncle is the head of a local syndicate and that he has hired Reika's father to find a rare diamond known as the Queen of Sheba. When Reika's father attempts to quit, he is stomped on by Ikeda's moll and is forced to remain when Ikeda threatens to tell Reika about her father. Ikeda learns Joji has overheard the conversation and sets out to stop him. He puts Joji into a trap where he is forced to fight an American boxer followed by a staff expert. Joji is able to defeat them both and escape. The next day, Joji, Reika, and another friend are chased by a ninja-like brigade hired by Ikeda, in which the friend, willing to distract them so Joji and Reika can escape, ends up thrown in a garbage can after an attempt to fight them off. When Ikeda sends some of his own men against Joji, Joji is able to fend off some of them until he is cornered. He gets some help from Spartacus, who sacrifices himself in order for Joji to escape. Joji and Reika are left, being chased by some shogun-like goons on bicycles until the entire brigade crash in a pile of cardboard boxes. Ikeda, unhappy with what has happened, decides to use Chihiro for bait and despite her efforts to fend off against her traitorous uncle and goons, is beaten bad and forced to take heroin. When Joji is forced to find the Queen of Shiba, he finds the diamond and when he returns with the diamond for Chihiro, he and Reika fall into a trap, but not before Reika sees her father shot down before her. One of Ikeda's molls, dressed up like a member of the Third Reich, has the trap Joji and Reika in filled with gas that was apparently used during World War II, which will cause madness within ten minutes. When the moll slips up into the trap, Joji and Reika and able to escape while the moll falls into madness. Joji fights off more thugs and successfully rescues Chihiro, who by this time, is heavily under the influence from heroin and tells Joji that he must keep the Hinoharu name alive for good. When Ikeda and his goons arrive to kill Joji, Chihiro sacrifices herself to save her brother as she is shot down and falls off a cliff. Joji learns that Ikeda is planning to use the Queen of Sheba to forge an alliance with the Hong Kong syndicate responsible for Toru's death. Joji heads to Hong Kong to follow his uncle and seeks revenge. After fighting off both members of the syndicate and Ikeda's men in the streets, Joji gets assistance from Mr. Magic, who is revealed to be Shinsuke Tachizawa, a narcotics agent working for Interpol. Tachizawa tells Joji to let the authorities handle the matter, but Joji is insistent on getting to Ikeda. At first, Tachizawa threatens to arrest Joji but instead helps him. A brief fight scene with Joji and Tachizawa teaming up leads to the arrest of the Hong Kong syndicate boss. When Ikeda and his group are celebrating their alliance, Joji busts in by throwing one of Ikeda's men through the glass roof, forcing the thug to crash into the dinner table. Joji singlehandedly faces off against all of Ikeda's men. With his lead moll and one henchmen shooting at him, he is able to use the sais of one of Ikeda's men and throws it at their hands. Ikeda narrowly escapes when Joji fights a hulking member of the goons. Joji is able to defeat the big man and finds himself targeted by more of Ikeda's men. An attempt to follow Ikeda by horseback leads to two men in a helicopter following Joji. One sports grenades and the other a machine gun. As Joji attempts to hide, he uses a tomahawk to hit the helicopter's fuel tank. When the gun-trotting thug sees Joji, his attempt to shoot Joji causes him to hit the leaking gas, causing the helicopter to crash, killing both thugs. Joji then diverts Ikeda's getaway car into the river after forcing a samurai henchman to accidentally kill the driver. Ikeda escapes before the car plunges into the river. When the samurai comes out to confront Joji, he is distracted by Joji's splashing of the water. Joji gives the samurai a crushing blow to his throat. Ikeda is the last one remaining and Joji follows him up a small cliff. Ikeda shoots Joji in the shoulder, forcing him to hide behind rocks. Taking off his shirt and throwing it as a distraction, Ikeda is now confronted by Joji and after having one bullet left, tells Joji they have the same Hinoharu blood. Joji responds that his name is Joji Hibiki and is able to kick the gun out of Ikeda and puts him up against the cliff wall. Giving Ikeda the Queen of Sheba, Joji sees Ikeda grabng and looking at the diamond, at which he then proceeds to impale Ikeda's eye with the diamond with a punch. Ikeda falls off the cliff to his death. Tachizawa arrives and arrests Joji. On the ride back, Tachizawa decides to let Joji by using magic to uncuff him. Joji, excited at the chance to leave and return to Texas, is seen in a freeze frame as he jumps out of the helicopter into the ocean.

Akumaa is known for her fascinating, yet sexually stimulating, ways of expressing \\"Medaase\\" (Thank you). Her exceptional ways of wearing her headgear also comes off as a distinct Akumaa brand. Little is known about Akumaa's early life as well as her family and educational background. However, it is known that her father is a policeman and her husband is a businessman to whom she has been married for over twenty-four years  Professional life  Akumaa emerged as a celebrated actress in the early 1990s when she featured in the popular Cantata Show as a \\"house girl.\\" This show was hosted by the Ghana Television Station. Her interest in broadcast journalism, precisely in radio, began in the early 2000s. In her interview with Deloris Frimpong Manso, Akumaa stated that Rosemary, a very good friend of hers, encouraged her to visit Joy FM, the Tema branch, in the year 2000 to discuss her interest in working with this popular Ghanaian radio station as a radio presenter. Although Akumaa possessed very little to zero background in broadcast journalism, her popularity as an actress together with her acumen as an eloquent speaker allowed Joy FM to offer her an opportunity to learn on the job. Looking up to radio and TV personalities such as Father Bosco, Akumaa applied her personal principles of hard work, discipline, and humility at her workplace and over a period of about eighteen years, rose through the ranks. Presently, she is a host for the Odo Ahomaso Show, which offers critical advise on relationship and marital issues on Adom TV in Ghana. If the name \\"Akumaa\\" or \\"Mama Zimbi\\" resonates as a household name in Ghana, the reasons can best be attributed to Dr. Dongotey- Padi's early contributions to the Cantata Show and her continuous interventions in people's relationship matters. For her position as a mentor, marriage counselor, and an expert on relationship/marriage issues, Akumaa identifies as #IAmTheSexDoctor, #IAmTheBestEver, and a \\"Relationship Doctor.\\"  Philanthropy  Beyond her work as a television and radio host, Akumaa runs a foundation, Mama Zimbi's Foundation, founded in 2004 that is committed to caring for and empowering underprivileged women, especially widows, and children in Ghana and reviving marriages.

Hays was instrumental in laying the foundations of Western medicine in Thailand and was also the first director of Siriraj Hospital and the first lecturer of Western medicine in Thailand at the Bhatayakorn School. Lerdsin was also the hospital where injured soldiers and civilians were treated following the Paknam incident. In 1929 plans were set up to build a Bang Rak Health Station for general treatment and paediatric treatment. Following a sexually-trainsmitted infection (STI) epidemic in 1936, an STI unit was established in 1939. During the Second World War, Lerdsin Hospital was damaged following the Bombing of Bangkok and general treatment was temporarily halted, while only the STI unit remained open. Following the war after years of successful operation of the STI unit, it became upgraded to the Division of Sexually-transmitted Infection Control of the Department of Medical Services (DMS) and hospital operations were transferred to the DMS and renamed Lerdsin Hospital. In 1973, the first residency training started at Lerdsin in the field of general surgery.

The archipelago consists of several islands, including Mauritius, R√©union, and Rodrigues. Mauritius claims responsibility for several Outer Islands, including St. Brandon and Agal√©ga, and has disputed territorial claims of Tromelin Island and the Chagos Archipelago. The deadliest tropical cyclone to affect the region was one that struck Mauritius in 1892, which killed 1,200 people, left 50,000 people homeless, and destroyed one-third of the capital Port Louis. Since 1950, there have been 249 human fatalities related to tropical cyclones in the Mascarene Islands. The deadliest storms since then were cyclones Carol in 1960, which killed 42 on Mauritius, and Jenny in 1962, which killed 17 on Mauritius and 32 on R√©union. The storms' close succession led to improved building codes. All known worldwide tropical cyclone precipitation records occurred on R√©union. This included a storm in 1958 that dropped of rainfall at Aurere over 48 hours. During a 24-hour period in January 1966, Cyclone Denise dropped of rainfall at Foc Foc, of which fell over 12 hours; both precipitation totals set records for their respective durations. In 1968, Cyclone Monique produced the highest wind gust on Rodrigues - at a station in the mountainous interior. The highest recorded wind gust on Mauritius - at Mon Desert - occurred when Cyclone Gervaise struck the island in February 1975; the cyclone killed 10 people on the island and caused about US$200 million in damage. During the 1980s, 27 cyclones affected the archipelago, beginning with Cyclone Hyacinthe, the wettest tropical cyclone on record after it dropped of rainfall over 14 days in January 1980 at Commerson Crater in the mountainous peaks of R√©union. In 1989, Cyclone Firinga caused US$217 million in damage from its high wind gusts. In the 1990s, 34 storms affected the Mascarene Islands, most notably Cyclone Bella in 1990, which damaged or destroyed 1,500 homes on Rodrigues, as well as Cyclone Hollanda, which caused the Mauritius Gross Domestic Product to decline by 10%. Since 2000, 64 storms affected the archipelago. In 2002, Cyclone Dina produced the highest wind gusts on R√©union, reaching . Cyclone Gamede dropped record rainfall over a four-day period in 2007, when Commerson Crater in R√©union's mountainous interior recorded of rainfall, breaking the world record for the most precipitation recorded over 72 hours and 96 hours, set previously during Cyclone Hyacinthe in 1980. The most recent storm to affect the island group was Cyclone Joaninha in March 2019. Background and climatology The Mascarene Islands are located in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. The island group has been known to the Arab world since the 10th century, and to Europeans since the 16th century. In 1638, the Dutch started a colony on Mauritius, but abandoned it after a severe cyclone struck in 1695. The French settled nearby R√©union in 1655, and colonized Mauritius in 1715, naming it Isle de France. During the Napoleonic Wars, the British took over Mauritius, maintaining possession of the island until 1968 when Mauritius became independent. The British also briefly took possession of R√©union from 1810 to 1815, until it was returned to France, which operates the island as an overseas department. According to a study from 1989, on average two storms pass within 320 km (200 mi) of R√©union or Mauritius each year, with a landfall about every five years.

Its maximum apparent visual magnitude is 9.49 but shows a variation in brightness down to a magnitude of 10.46 in a periodic cycle of roughly 8 hours. The observed variability is typical of W Ursae Majoris variable stars, so the two stars in this system form a contact binary. System The observed spectral type of both stars in this system is G5, and one of them is a main sequence star very similar to the sun. They are orbiting so close that their envelopes touch each other. This is a dynamically stable phase that should last until one of the two stars leaves the main sequence. The system could also host a third body with an orbital period of 19,046 days, with a minimum mass of 0.007 and an eccentricity of 0.22, but not all data collected in time are consistent with this hypothesis. Variability The two stars eclipse each other during their orbit, but they have an elongated shape so they show a constant variation instead of discrete eclipses. Anyway, a periodicity can be seen clearly, but it changes with time; the period shows a long-term trend and a periodic modulation of 7,000 days. The effects responsible for this behaviour could be a third body in the system, magnetic interaction between two stars, mass transfer from one star to the another, mass loss of the system, and recently even an internal mechanism in the touching envelopes have been proposed.

It first appeared in book form in the collection A Gun for Dinosaur and Other Imaginative Tales (Doubleday, 1963). It has also appeared in Science Fiction Yearbook no. 3 (Popular Library, 1969) and the collection The Best of L. Sprague de Camp (Doubleday, Feb. 1978). The story has been translated into German.Laughlin, Charlotte, and Levack, Daniel J. H. De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, pages 172-173. Plot summary For mild-mannered Ovid Ross of Rattlesnake, Montana, struggling to gain his footing among the city slickers of New York City, the Telegog Company seems to offer a solution to his social problems. Its proprietary technology allows the inept to have their bodies taken over remotely by experts who easily steer them through awkward situations. After hearing salesman Mr. Nye's sales pitch and meeting in-house professionals Gilbert Falck and Jerome Bundy, Ross signs up and receives the necessary implant. Ross first signals his \\"guide\\" on facing a terrifying job interview with Timothy Hoolihan, tyrannical director of The Garment Gazette trade journal; Falck takes over and under his control Ross effortlessly finesses Hoolihan and gets the job. Enthusiastic over his success, Ross treats Falke to drinks after work, and later calls up his girlfriend Claire La Motte with the good news. To celebrate, Claire invites him over for a Sunday picnic at the estate of the Peshkovs, a wealthy Russian family she works for, including Falck and the latter's girl in the invitation. After Ross learns the ropes at his new job he is sent out to interview one of the journal's major advertisers, Marcus Ballin of Outstanding Knitwear, for a feature article. Worried he might blow it, he calls in Falck again. He also extends Claire's invitation and arranges to have Bundy backstop him on the picnic if necessary, given that Falck will be unable to do so. Under Falck's guidance, Ross's interview of Ballin goes well until the knitwear man starts talking about a current project; a pageant to choose the most beautiful bust in America from among women modeling Outstanding's sheer sweaters. It seems he needs a third judge. To his horror, Ross finds Falck volunteering him for the role. His guide afterwards says he has done Ross a favor, it being \\"an opportunity most men would fight tooth and nail for.\\" The mortified Ross demands Falck see him through it, to which Falck smugly replies he has every intention of doing so. Strait-laced Hoolihan is not happy to hear what Ross will be doing, but his subordinates talk him into agreeing, lest the journal lose Ballin's account. Meanwhile, Sunday rolls around, and Ross picks up Falck and the guide's date Dorothea Dunkelberg for their picnic with Claire. Having signaled Bundy, Ross is confident he will not commit any gaffes. Claire shows the party around the Peshkov estate and points out neighboring properties, among them the Heliac Health Club, a nudist camp. After lunch, Falck asks to use the phone, and uses it to call Bundy. He tells Bundy that Ross is bombing with Claire, and suggests he \\"give him a more aggressive and uninhibited pattern.\\" Bundy agrees, unaware that Falck, who has become smitten with Claire, is not out to help Ross but to sabotage him. Shortly Ross is bossing the party, even browbeating everyone into swimming naked. At this point the Peshkovs, who were expected to be absent all day, return, forcing the dishabille picnickers to run for the woods to hide. In a bit of luck, they find themselves on the grounds of the Heliac Club, where they fit right in. Less happily, one of the club members turns out to be Marcus Ballin, but neither he nor Ross are interested in their presence at Heliac coming out, and agree to keep things quiet. Ballin does suggest Claire enter his contest, though! Provided clothing by a helpful matron, Claire retrieves the others' outfits from the Peshkov estate, and Ross uses the signaler in his pocket to have Bundy release control. He then shamefacedly apologizes to Claire for his earlier behavior, but she laughs it off, confiding she has not had so much fun in years. She also decides to enter Ballin's contest. Despite his chagrin over Bundy's guidance, Ross realizes he has to stick with Telegog for a while. As for the frustrated Falck, thwarted in his sabotage attempt, he doubles down, installing a switch in Bundy's control booth that will enable him to secretly flip control of their clients whenever he wants. At the contest, there are complications. Ross, guided by Falck, performs well, but Claire is worried because her employer Bogdin Peshkov, whom she suspects of lusting after her, is present‚Äîand drunk. Sure enough, when Claire is denied first place, Peshkov makes a scene, whereupon Ballin orders him removed. Falck, seizing his chance to embarrass Ross, flips his switch, and his control of Ross is flipped to Bundy, currently controlling a ballet dancer; Ross pirouettes across the stage, slamming into Peshkov, who is now threatening the gathering with a pistol. As the shocked Bundy releases control, Ross himself takes charge and successfully restores order. Far from being shamed, Ross is now a hero. The grateful Ballin hires him away from The Garment Gazette, and Mr. Nye at Telegog assures him that Falck's subterfuge has been discovered and the disgraced guide fired. He offers a free extension of its services in compensation for the trouble, but Ross declines. Newly confident in his own abilities, he has proposed to Claire and been accepted. But, Nye urges, suppose he prove bashful on his wedding night‚Äî? \\"No!\\" shouts Ross. \\"By gosh, there's some things I'm gonna do for myself!\\" Setting The story is set in a near future similar to the era in which it was written, but in which the Soviet Union has been overthrown by a Capitalist revolution (The Peshkovs are former Communist apparatchiks living in exile), and characterized by unusually advanced developments in neurology. Reception P. Schuyler Miller, reviewing it with the other stories in A Gun for Dinosaur and Other Imaginative Tales wrote \\"Lack confidence? Don't--as 'The Guided Man' did--let the operators of the Telagog Company take over for you.\\" He considered it \\"distinctly late-model de Camp, commenting on the current scene--and especially the suburban, or more properly exurban scene--by projecting it into the future, where its 'things of custom' appear in all their incongruity. As the plot grows simpler and simpler, the settings and commentary carry more and more of the load, in the manner of an off-Broadway play. And there will be those who say the author has written himself into most of his rather put-upon heroes-in-spite-of-themselves.\\"Miller, P. Schuyler. \\"The Reference Library.\\" In Analog Science Fact-Science Fiction, v. 71, no. 5, July 1963, page 90. Avram Davidson, on the other hand, found the collection \\"a great disappointment ... Time after time he gets hold of a great idea--and throws it away in playing for laughs of the feeblest conceivable sort.\\" He singled out one exception, but it wasn't this one.Davidson, Avram. \\"Books.\\" In The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, v. 25, no. 4, October 1963, pages 20-21. Robert Coulson, reviewing The Best of L. Sprague de Camp, wrote \\"'The Guided Man' is unsophisticated and unsure of himself in the big city, so he hires a firm of experts to guide him in crucial situations by actually taking over his body, with, of course, unexpected results, especially since one of the operators has designs on his client's girl friend. This is the sort of 'society fantasy' that the slick magazines of the era were buying, though this particular story was probably too scientific and too rowdy for them.\\"Coulson, Robert. \\"Humorists in a Strange Land.\\" In Amazing Stories, v. 62, no. 1, May 1987, pages 70-72. Relation to other works De Camp took a different approach to the theme of curing shyness in the similarly-titled \\"The Hibited Man\\" (1949), whose protagonist is subjected to an experiment that has the side-effect of removing his inhibitions. Projected film adaptation In April 2006 the story was reported to have been optioned for film as a romantic comedy to be titled \\"Speechless,\\" with Brian Dannelly as director and Adrien Brody and Lindsay Lohan in talks to star. The original adaptation was written by Steve Adams and the story updated by Dannelly and Michael Urban. According to Daily Variety, the adaptation involves an introverted man (Brody) so terrified of having to give a speech at a friend's wedding that he turns to a service allowing someone else (Lohan) to speak through him. Production was projected to start production later in 2006.Gardner, Chris. \\"Duo set for 'Speechless' : Brody, Lohan saying yes\\" (article in Variety, \\"April 27, 2006).\\"Brody, Lohan in talks to be 'Speechless'\\" (article in Entertainment News, April 28, 2006).\\"Lohan and Brody are Speechless\\" (article in Casting Update, April 28, 2006).

Early life Manning Long was born in 1906 in Chase City, Virginia to Dr. Charles Massie Long (b.1868 ‚Äì d.1945) and Elizabeth Harrison Fletcher Long (b.1873 ‚Äì d.1938). Very little is known of her early life and education. She lived in Washington D.C., then later New York and New Jersey, as she launched her career as a writer. Career Manning's debut Novel Here's Blood in your Eye, was published by Duell, Sloan and Pearce in September 1941. In it, audiences were introduced to the character of Liz Parrott, a former Arkansas school teacher, who relocated to Brooklyn, found work as an artist's model, and inadvertently stumbled into a murder mystery involving characters in the Greenwich Village Art scene. Throughout the 1940s, Long would write a total of seven Liz Parrott novels, all published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce under the Bloodhound Mysteries imprint. Long's books were published abroad by Hammond & Hammond Co. of London, and translated for French audiences by Nicholson & Watson. In addition to her crime novels, Long contributed short stories to popular magazines such as Collier's. Her final work was a children's fantasy adventure novel \\"The Fog Boat\\" co authored with Lewis Coffin, and published in 1957. Liz Parrott character When the reader first meets Louise \\"Liz\\" Boykin she is living in Brooklyn Heights on a shoestring budget, trying to find her way in the world. She is headstrong, intuitive and slightly reckless. She has a caustic, southern wit and a salty tongue. Liz lives with her beloved cat, I Am, and later a husband, Gordon Parrott of the N.Y. District Attorney's Office. Now and then Gordon loosely implies the reason Liz keeps getting caught up with intrigue over and over again, is that she is somehow psychic.Long, Manning(1942)Vicious Circle. Duell Sloane & Pearce, NY The books leave this possibility open ended. While Gordon is away during the War, Liz finds part- time work at a Circulating library Book Store, which they later purchase together. In her final adventure Liz courts danger and does her detective work while highly pregnant.Barnett, Colleen(1997)An Encyclopedia of Leading Women Characters in Mystery Fiction. Vol .1 p.189 Poison Pen Press, AZ Critical reception Manning Long's books were positively received by The Saturday Review and The New Yorker, with critics singling out her writing style and characters wit and humour. Anthony Boucher repeatedly praised Long's work, once stating, \\"There are many mystery-mongers whom I highly esteem for various weighty reasons, but there are few indeed who are more sheer fun to read than the brusquely ironic Manning Long.\\" In an EQMM column in 1948, Boucher called out Long's novel Savage Breast and George Bagby's In Cold Blood as the best humorous mystery novels of the year.Marks, Jeffery(2008)Anthony Boucher : A Bibliography .p131 McFarland & Co. Today the Liz Parrott books, still garner praise and affection from reviewers and connoisseurs out-of-print detective fiction, including the Crime Writer and athonlogist Bill Pronzini. Manning Long's novels appear to have achieved commercial success in their day. Of the many dozens of mystery writers working under the Bloodhound imprint, Long was published more frequently by Duell, Sloan and Pearce than any other, except Dorothy B. Hughes and Lawrence Treat. Later Life and Family While living in New York, Manning Long met Peter Wentworth Williams.

She is said to have been the physician in charge of Akbar's royal harem, and to have married the legendary Bourbon prince Jean-Philippe de Bourbon-Navarre, and to have been the sister of one of Akbar's wives. She is credited with building the first church in Agra (now in India). Origins Mughal emperor Akbar Lady Juliana was the sister of Akbar's Christian wife and was the physician in charge of the royal harem. At some point these sisters were brought to Agra. One account is that Juliana and her sister were the daughters of Abdul Hai, Akbar's Chief Justice and that they were from Cilicia in Western Armenia. Rev. Thomas Smith, an historian, scholar and journalist who was born into an Indo-Armenian family in Agra reports Lady Juliana as Armenian and given to Jean-Phillipe by Akbar. In Prince Michael of Greece's research on the descendants of Jean-Phillipe de Bourbon, he feels \\"certain that he [Jean- Phillipe] was the son of Charles III, the Constable of France, the richest and most famous and powerful member of the family\\". In Prince Michael's book Le Rajah de Bourbon, Jean-Phillipe married the Portuguese sister of the Christian wife of Akbar, was also given a large amount of land and became a Rajah (king) in India. He also explains how Jean-Phillipe was the first Bourbon French king, Henry IV's nephew and how sometime before 1560, Jean-Phillipe embarked on a worldwide adventure before landing at the gates of Akbar's empire. His subsequent marriage to Lady Juliana after she tended to him during a severe illness and was then gifted to him by Akbar, produced a long line of Bourbons in Bhopal, India. Others too, have claimed her as Portuguese but research published by Zaman in 2012 has disputed Portuguese scholar, J. A. Ismael Gracias's belief that Akbar's wife or her sister were Portuguese. Many other ladies were also named Juliana. One Portuguese Lady Juliana Dias da Costa came later into Mughal history and her story may be contributory to the confusion with Lady Juliana Mascarenhas. Gracias describes Akbar's wife Maryam Makani being Maria Mascarenas and her sister being Juliana. This too is false according to Zaman, who argues that Maryam is the name given to Akbar's mother, Hamida Banu Begum. Frederick Fanthome in Reminiscences of Agra (1895) expresses his conviction that Akbar had a Christian wife named Mary whose influence on Akbar had been underestimated by other historians. He recounts the story of Jean-Phillipe and similarly states his conviction of Akbar's leanings toward Christianity. Untangling the Julias for Gracias and Fanthome was not so vital if understood in the context of their [Julias] Christian faith and combined bloodlines and associations with the Mughals being the significant theme. In addition, it was also not irrational to understand why the Greek Prince would have an interest too, as in the 2007 article in The Guardian entitled ‚ÄúFound in India: The Last King of France‚Äù. In conclusion, Zaman understands previous accounts being part fact and part fiction at a time when Christian influences via European women appeared attractive, particularly in the final days of the Mughal Empire. Life in India Akbar arranged Juliana's marriage to Prince Jean-Phillipe de Bourbon of France in 1560 and paid for the construction of the church they built in 1562. Death According to the Agra Mission archives, she was buried with her husband in the church they established in 1562, although their remains were never found. Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan had the church demolished in 1636. The Native chapel was rebuilt over the site and in the compound of St Peter's Roman Catholic Cathedral. Descendants of Lady Juliana and Jean-Philippe with the name \\"Bourbon\\" continue to reside in Bhopal.

He died at his house in a catastrophic fire of his own creation and the garden which remained, and was restored, gave rise to the poem Burnt Norton by T. S. Eliot. Early life Keyt was the eldest son of William Keyt of Ebrington, Gloucestershire, and his wife Agnes Clopton, daughter of Sir John Clopton of Clopton, Warwickshire. He was educated privately. He succeeded his grandfather in the baronetcy on 30 November 1702. He married Anne Tracy, daughter of William Tracy, 4th Viscount Tracy, of Rathcoole on 23 November 1710. Career Keyt became Recorder of Stratford- on-Avon in 1709 and held the post for the rest of his life. He was a leading Jacobite in Warwickshire and in 1715 he was taken off the commission of the peace because he proclaimed the Pretender. He was elected Tory Member of Parliament for Warwick at a by-election on 22 November 1722 which was at great expense to both sides. In Parliament, he consistently voted against the Government. A local Whig wrote of him that he was 'a Tory indeed; barring that I hear a mighty good character of him in all respects'. He was returned unopposed at the 1727 general election. At the 1734 general election, there was a contest at Warwick in which he was successful in the poll, but unseated on petition on 25 February 1735. Death and legacy In 1716 Keyt acquired Norton House near Chipping Campden. He built a mansion on an adjacent site and laid out a garden at the same time. It had a large parterre, terraces and plantations with walks. He left his wife for her maid, and went to live at Norton with her. When she saw his house, she asked ‚Äòwhat is a kite without wings‚Äô, and so he extended it with two large side extensions. In time she deserted him, and he began drinking heavily. One night in September 1741 he caused a fire which spread to the whole house. Unsuccessful attempts were made to rescue him and little was left of him to be buried at the church of Aston- sub-Edge. It was said he was deranged and set the fire deliberately. It was also proposed that he started the fire after a bout of heavy drinking. Keyt left children * Thomas Charles Keyt (1712-1755) who succeeded to the baronetcy as 4th Baronet * John Keyt, an officer in the army * William Keyt who died young * Robert Keyt (1714-1784) who succeeded to the baronetcy as 5th Baronet and died without issue * Agnes who married Edward Gibbes and had three daughters The estate became known as Burnt Norton and the garden remained as an attraction. It was after visiting the garden that T. S. Eliot wrote Burnt Norton the first of his Four Quartets. Keyt's story is the basis for the historical novel Burnt Norton by Caroline Sandon.

Fleming, MD Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at Yale University and Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis, HHMI investigator, and Director of the Microbial Sciences Institute at Yale Medical School. Jacobs-Wagner's research has shown that bacterial cells have a great deal of substructure including analogs of microfilaments, and that proteins are directed by regulatory processes to locate to specific places within the bacterial cell. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2015 and has received a number of scientific awards.  Early life and education  Christine Jacobs-Wagner grew up in Belgium in a town near Liege. She thought of becoming a cyclist or a badminton Olympian, but was undecided about a career through high school. Christine Jacobs-Wagner received her BS degree in biochemistry from University of Liege. She also received her MS in 1991 and the PhD in 1996 from University of Liege in Belgium in the field of Biochemistry. She then went to work with Lucy Shapiro at Stanford Medical School on a fellowship from the European Molecular Biology Organization. where she studied Caulobacter, a bacterium with a flagellum on one end and a stalk on the other end, beginning her fascination with how bacterial cells can become asymmetrical. From 2004 to 2019, she has taught and conducted research as a professor at Yale University.  Academic career  As of 2018, Jacobs- Wagner holds an endowed chair in Yale Medical School and is director of their Microbial Institute.  Research  Christine Jacobs-Wagner's major breakthrough has been the discovery that the tiny cells of bacteria such as Caulobacter, Escherichia coli, and Borrelia are not simply bags of biochemicals but instead program the locations of their protein components via their regulatory systems. She also discovered the protein crescentin which forms bacterial intermediate filaments, structures once thought to occur only in eukaryotic cells. The current focus of her laboratory's work is to discover regulation of the times and places for critical components of the DNA replication and cell division processes so that proliferation control can be understood.

Jones was inspired by the work of John James Audubon to illustrate a book identifying nests and eggs of the 130 species of birds that nested in Ohio. She died having completed only five illustrations, and the book, Illustrations of the Nests and Eggs of Birds of Ohio, was published posthumously.  Personal life and education  Jones was born on May 13, 1847, in Circleville, Ohio to parents Dr. Nelson E. Jones and Virginia Smith Jones. She had one younger brother, Howard. Jones was home-schooled by her mother until she reached high- school age, when she attended high school in Circleville. She excelled in mathematics, science, languages (French, Greek, and German), music (piano and flute), sewing, and dancing. She graduated from high school in 1865. Following graduation, she continued independent studies of language, music, chemistry, algebra, and calculus. One tutor \\"considered her the most adept scholar he had ever taught.\\" In contrast to her academic success, Jones had difficulties in her personal life. She experienced headaches and eye pains as a result of Civil War-related anxiety. During Reconstruction, Jones suffered outbreaks of acne rosacea that made her self-conscious of her appearance. Jones had one serious romantic interest in her life, with whom she was engaged to be married. However, due to his problems with alcoholism, her parents and brother Howard induced her to break off the engagement and forbade her from marrying him. This resulted in a period in which Jones became silent and withdrawn. In July 1879, while working on illustrations for Illustrations of the Nests and Eggs of Birds of Ohio, Jones fell ill with Typhoid fever. She succumbed to the disease and died three weeks later on August 17, 1879.  Natural history work and Illustrations of the Nests and Eggs of Birds of Ohio Jones's father Nelson, a doctor and amateur ornithologist, imparted his love of natural history and birds on his children while they were growing up. Nelson, Genevieve, and Howard collected nests and eggs, hand-raised and rescued songbirds, and eventually created a family aviary in the barn behind their house. On one nest-collecting excursion, Genevieve discovered a nest that neither Nelson nor Howard could identify, and learned that there were no existing resources on nests and eggs of North American birds. Following her broken engagement, Jones traveled to at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876. There, she was impressed by John James Audubon's paintings from The Birds of America on display, although she noted that the paintings focused on birds and rarely pictured their corresponding nests and eggs. Upon her return from Philadelphia, Nelson, Virginia, and Howard encouraged Genevieve to seriously commence work on a book illustrating nests and eggs of North American birds, partially as an ornithological resource and partially as a project to improve her low spirits. Jones originally planned to illustrate the nests and eggs of all 320 species of American birds, but was later persuaded to scale the project back to the 130 species of birds in Ohio. Jones completed five illustrations for the project before her death from Typhoid fever in 1879. Virginia and Howard continued work on the book, publishing Illustrations of the Nests and Eggs of Birds of Ohio in 1886.

Tobacco smoking among South Africans is quite a customary practice, but, in recent years, the percentage of smokers has decreased. This is largely due to the increase in the precaution of the dangers of smoking and enforcement of stricter legislation on the tobacco industry. In 1996, the provinces with the highest percentage and prevalence of smoking include Northern Cape (55%), Western Cape (48%) and North-West (46%). However, the number of smokers still remains stagnant. Despite the efforts to bring awareness to the risks that come with smoking, there is still a high prevalence of tobacco use in South Africa; and it is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality.  Statistics  As more significant studies are published on smoking and second handing inhalation of smoke, the South African public has become more educated on the dangers of smoking. This has led to the overall decline in number of smokers and thus number of related deaths. Currently, approximately 50,000 South Africans die per year due to the effects smoking such as an increased risk for lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. In 2000 approximately 34,108 males and 10,306 females died due to the various consequences of smoking. According to the latest South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2012 only about 16.4% of South Africans smoked which is a substantial drop from 32% in 1993. This decrease is attributed to legislation which led to restrictions in advertisement, and an increase tobacco prices. However, a Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that 21% of students in grades 8-11 smoke. This shows little to no change between 2002 and 2008.  Legislation   The Tobacco Products Control Act (1993)  Visible No Smoking sign in South Africa. This bilingual sign used to prevent public smoking. In order to combat the dangers of smoking, legislation has been increasingly put into place in order to deter the public from smoking. Beginning in 1993 with the Tobacco Products Control Act, South African began to pass legislation to in order to protect the public. It was fully implemented and enforced in 1995, meaning smoking in public places became some-what regulated. In addition, the act prohibited some aspects of advertisement, the promotion of tobacco products, and the publicity of a sponsorship is prohibited. Merchandise containing tobacco may be visible when being sold, however customers are not allowed to handle the products prior to the purchase. Labeling was limited in some aspects, however was not heavily regulated until 1999. Notably the act prohibited the sale of tobacco products to minor under the age of 16.  Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act (1999)  The Tobacco Products Control Act of 1993 was considered to be incomplete and incomprehension, and in 1999 the South African government passed the Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act. This created stricter regulations for public smoking and banned smoking in public places such as restaurants, the work place and public transport. Being set into motion in 2001 the act prohibited all forms of tobacco advertising and promotion. Additionally, the act suggests penalties for those who transgress the law. The act also places a limit on the permissible levels of nicotine and tar.

According to the Middle East Eye source, the Tiger Squad is a death squad of members from the military and intelligence agencies that has a mandate to carry out covert operations and executions, killing Saudi dissidents inside Saudi Arabia and abroad in a way that \\"goes unnoticed by the media, the international community\\". Sa'ad Al-Faqih, who claims he knows about this squad, confirmed that the role of the squad was to target and kill Saudi opponents. History and composition According to the Middle East Eyes source, the Tiger Squad was formed in 2017 and , consists of 50 secret service and military personnel. The group members are recruited from different branches of the Saudi forces, directing several areas of expertise. The source was independently verified by Middle East Eye, though it could not confirm his information. On the other hand, BBC Newsnight reported a team of fifty Saudi officers to target Saudi critics was created in summer of 2018, and, according to David Ignatius, United States intelligence became aware in September 2018 of a \\"tiger team\\" to be created by Asiri for covert operations against unknown targets. The Middle East Eye source said the Tiger Squad assassinates dissidents using varying methods such as planned car accidents, house fires, or injecting toxic substances into adversaries during regular health checkups. Saudi Crown prince Mohammad bin Salman had selected five members of his personal security team to serve in the Tiger squad. Alleged operations According to the Middle East Eye source, the five members of the Tiger Squad selected by Mohammad bin Salman allegedly spearheaded the 15-member death squad responsible for murdering and dismembering Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In a later report, Middle East Eye stated seven members of the 15-member death squad were Mohammed bin Salman's personal bodyguards. According to the BBC source, the whole 15-member death squad killing Jamal Khashoggi were part of the Tiger Squad (Tiger Team). The New York Times reported that according to US officials who had access to classified intelligence reports, the members of the team involved in killing Khashoggi were also involved in more than a dozen operations since 2017. The US officials referred to this team as \\"Saudi Rapid Intervention Group\\". The Washington Post had reported citing anonymous intelligence officials that some members of the team had received special operations training by a company operating in Arkansas under the licence of the US State Department as part of US-Saudi cooperation. The Tiger Squad also reportedly killed Suleiman Abdul Rahman al-Thuniyan, a Saudi court judge who was murdered by injection of deadly virus into his body when he had visited a hospital for a regular health checkup. \\"One of the techniques the tiger squad uses to silence dissidents or opponents of the government is to 'kill them with HIV, or other sorts of deadly viruses'\\". However, some sources have stated that al-Thuniyan died after he suffered from a chronic disease. Middle East Eye's source said, \\"I know of another attempt, which was to lure Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz in Canada to the consulate and kill him, but Abdulaziz refused to go and the mission failed. Khashoggi was the first [successful] operation.\\" Abdulaziz, who had made a YouTube video satirizing the kingdom, said he was approached earlier in 2018 by Saudi officials who urged him to visit their embassy with them to collect a new passport. He said they said \\"it will only take one hour, just come with us to the embassy.\\" After he refused, Saudi authorities arrested two of his brothers and several of his friends in Saudi Arabia.

The book tells the story of a boy and his father going fishing. Phi created the book because of his desire to have books about people like himself to read to his daughter. Bui's detailed illustrations allowed Phi to remove elements of the prose. Bui, who had never illustrated a traditional picture book before, won praise for her use of colors and was recognized with a 2018 Caldecott Honor. The book received positive reviews and appeared on best of 2017 book lists.  Plot  A boy goes fishing early one Saturday morning with his father, who immigrated to the United States after the Vietnam War. The family depends on catching food to have enough to eat. After they catch a fish, the two return home so that the boy's father can go to work. The boy knows that that night for dinner they will eat the fish they've caught.  Background  Author Bao Phi had wanted more diverse books to read to his daughter. He decided to adapt an unpublished poem of his into a children's picture book because he thought that there was few picture books that deal directly with the struggles of Southeast Asian refugees in America. Following a blog post he wrote about another one its titles, Capstone Publishers reached out to Phi to ask him to submit a children's book; he then shared with them the \\"script\\" to A Different Pond. After seeing Thi Bui's illustrations, Phi was struck by their beauty and power and decided to remove some of the writing, thinking that the pictures served to describe what he was feeling. Bui was excited to illustrate the book because the similarity between Bui and Phi allowed her to tap into her own immigrant experience. She also asked Phi for details of his childhood so she could capture them in her illustrations. She was inspired by Maurice Sendak's In the Night Kitchen. Bui had never drawn for a picture book before, nor had she drawn in full color before, and was struck by having to draw at a level of detail unlike her graphic novels, though she was relieved by its length as compared to her 300-page memoir. To overcome this she digitally experimented with colors and textures. The book was published on August 1, 2017 by Capstone.  Writing and illustrations  While the story is about a specific Southeast Asian family it also contains more universal elements. The background of the family being refugees due to the Vietnam War, which the father is unable to speak about, is a powerful force in the story, although refugee status is not explicitly stated. The family's poverty is also a major feature. These are referenced through things such as a bologna sandwich the father and son eat while fishing, and the boy's wondering why they need to catch fish to eat when his father works two jobs. The father acts as an excellent parent, working to make life better for his son while also mentoring, guiding, and providing a loving home for him, which helps him mature and grow. The book could seem, in the words of the Kirkus review, \\"melancholy\\", but the way the words and pictures work together instead creates a \\"gentle[r]\\" feel. Bui's background in cartoons and elements of graphic novels, helps to capture the mood and feel of the text. For instance, the use of frames helps to keep the story focused on the present even as it flashes back to the past. In the words of Anna Haase Krueger writing for School Library Journal, \\"The text placement and composition of the illustrations allow each occurrence or observation to be its own distinct event, stringing together the small, discrete moments that make up a life, a memory, and a history into a cohesive whole.\\" Bui's use of blues and the way she contrasts them with other colors such as reds and oranges, drew particular praise. Also drawing praise was the cover illustration which served to both draw readers in and encapsulate the story.  Reception  The book was well received. It earned starred reviews from Booklist, where reviewer Sarah Hunter described the book as a \\"wistful, beautifully illustrated story\\" and recognised the applicability of its central theme to immigrant families, and to struggling families generally; author Minh L√™, writing for The Horn Book Magazine, praised the \\"powerfully understated picture book\\" and recognized its ability to shift the focus of the refugee narrative from the painful journey to the reality awaiting the family members once they reach their destination. Kirkus Reviews; Publishers Weekly; and School Library Journal. The book was also named in many end of year best children's books lists including by The Washington Post, the HuffPost, The Boston Globe, Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, the New York Public Library, the Chicago Public Library and as an ALA Notable book which summarized, \\"In this gentle, honest tale of immigrant survival, a young Vietnamese American boy and his father go on an early morning fishing trip.\\" The book was awarded a Caldecott Honor with the committee praising the book for the way it uses a, \\"cinematic experience, powerfully capturing facial expressions, mood, and quiet moments\\" to portray the book's themes. The book was also awarded a Boston Globe‚ÄìHorn Book Honor. In her acceptance speech Bui praised Phi saying he had \\"one of the biggest hearts I‚Äôve ever met and bravely wearing it openly for everyone to see and learn from. I‚Äôm so glad we got to make this book together\\".

Background   Origin of the name  The name Mauscheln means something like \\"(secretive) talk\\". According to Meyers Konversationslexikon of 1885 to 1892 the word Mauschel is derived from the Hebrew word moscheh \\"Moses\\", in Ashkenazi Herbrew Mausche, Mousche, and was a nickname for Jews; in Old German mauscheln means something like \\"speak with a Jewish accent\\" or haggle\\". Today mauscheln is a synonym for \\"scheme\\", \\"wheel and deal\\", \\"wangle\\" or \\"diddle\\". Other names for the game include Anschlagen (in Tyrol and Lower Austria), Polish Bank (Polnische Bank, not to be confused with another game of this name) or Panczok, also Kratzen,Although Kratzen is usually played with 'hop and jump' and the Weli, unlike Mauscheln. or Frische Vier (in Lower Austria, Styria and Burgenland). It also used to be known as Angehen. The 3-card game, Dreiblatt or Tippen, is very similar to Mauscheln.  History  Mauscheln first appeared towards the end of the 19th century and was initially very popular in Jewish trading circles. In 1890, Ulmann described Angehen as \\"very popular in ladies' circles\\", noting that it was called Mauscheln in south Germany. During the First World War it flourished among the German soldiers and has since become widespread in the German-speaking world.Mauscheln at www.casinospiegel.net. Retrieved 24 Oct 2018 Mauscheln is one of the most popular games in Austria and is commonly played everywhere except in the states of Vorarlberg in the west and Burgenland in the east. One modern source describes it as little more than an excerpt of Ombre and Boston and \\"so simple and mindless that anyone can learn it in five minutes.\\" The game clearly revolves around money, resulting in attempts to classify and ban it as a game of chance. However, it is not a gambling game in the legal sense.  Basic rules   Players and cards  Like Tippen, Mauscheln may be played by 3 to 5 players with a 32-card, usually German-suited, pack. If more players participate a 52-card French pack may be used.  Dealing  The dealer places a stake of four chips or coins (e.g. 40¬¢; it must be divisible by four) as the Pinke or Stamm in the pot and deals two cards to each player. The next one is turned as trumps and then another 2 cards are dealt. The remaining cards are placed face down on the table.  Bidding  Forehand, left of the dealer, leads the bidding by announcing whether to \\"pass\\" (i.e. drop out of the current deal) or \\"diddle\\" (ich mauschele i.e. \\"I'll play\\"). In doing so, he undertakes to win at least two tricks. If he drops out, the other players in turn may opt to diddle. If no-one diddles, the cards are thrown in, the next player pays 4 chips to the pot and deals for the next game. Once a player has declared \\"diddle\\", the others may either \\"pass\\" (ich passe) or \\"play\\" (ich gehe mit i.e. \\"I'll join you\\"). If all the others pass, the diddler (Mauschler) claims the pot without playing a game. If at least one other player joins in, all active players, in order, may exchange up to 4 hand cards with the talon, throwing their discards face down onto a 'bonfire' (Scheiterhaufen).  Playing  The diddler leads to the first trick. Thereafter the winner of a trick leads to the next. Players must follow suit if possible (Farbzwang) or trump if unable (Trumpfzwang); in any case they must head the trick if they can (Stechzwang).  Scoring  Scoring is as follows: * For every trick taken a player wins 1/4 of the Pinke * If a player 'joins in' but fails to take a trick they pay a b√™te into the pot i.e. an amount equivalent to that in the pot; as does the diddler if he only succeeds in taking one trick. * If the diddler remains trickless, he is a Mauschelbete (\\"diddler beast\\") and pays a double b√™te into the pot.  Variations  In addition to variations in cutting and dealing, the following other variations are recorded:  Knocking  If the dealer turns up a high trump such as the Sow (= Ace/Deuce), and before looking at his cards, he may 'knock' (klopfen) which in effect means he will diddle. He takes over the game and has to take at least 2 tricks. If one or more of the others choose to play, the dealer looks at his cards, discards any he deems unfavourable and exchanges them with the trump turnup and fresh cards from the talon, without viewing them. Once the other active player(s) have exchanged, the dealer may pick up his new cards together with the 'knocked' trump.  Quartets  If anyone is dealt a quartet, they must discard them onto the bonfire, pay the Pinke and are then dealt another hand which they may exchange.  Belli  The 7 or 7 is the permanent, second-highest trump after the trump Ace or Sow. It may incur a penalty payment if lost to the Ace.  Weli  The Weli (6) may be added to the pack as the 33rd card and permanent, second-highest trump  See also  * Dreiblatt  References   Literature  * Geiser, Remigius (2004). \\"100 Kartenspiele des Landes Salzburg\\", in Talon, Issue 13. * Grupp, Claus D (1975/1979).

Barrack Hebrew Academy) in Philadelphia, graduating in 2000.\\"Alumni Spotlight,\\" Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy. He then graduated from Yale University in 2004, with a bachelor's degree in Latin Classics. Bloom and his wife, Aliza (n√©e Hochman), met at Yale, where she earned a B.A. in economics and international studies. They have two sons, Isaiah and Judah. The family lives in St. Petersburg, Florida, close to Tropicana Field in part so he could easily return on Friday nights to make Shabbat with his family, as he is Sabbath-observant. Career Bloom's first entry into the baseball world was an article in Baseball Prospectus in 1997, and he continued writing for it until he joined the Rays. Prior to joining the Rays, he was a baseball operations intern for the San Diego Padres and a legal/corporate partnerships intern for Major League Baseball. Tampa Bay Rays Bloom began working for the Tampa Bay Rays in February 2005 as an intern, was hired by the Rays full-time to work in Minor League Operations in October 2005. He was promoted to Assistant Director of Minor League Operations in 2008, with responsibility for all aspects of the team's minor league system, including player evaluation and assignments, expansion of video, strength and conditioning, and mental skills initiatives, creating of the \\"Rays Way\\" player development manual, and executing individual development plans for organization's prospects. He was named Director of Baseball Operations in 2011, expanding his job to include contract negotiations, salary arbitration, budgeting, and overseeing major league support staff and international scouting. In 2014, when General Manager Andrew Friedman left the Rays organization, the Rays promoted Bloom to Vice President of Baseball Operations. His responsibilities expanded to include his overseeing domestic and international player development, a newly created baseball performance science department, trade negotiations, pro, amateur, and international scouting philosophy, personnel additions and changes throughout baseball operations, and short- and long-term strategic planning. He was named Senior Vice President of Baseball Operations in 2016, second in command behind President of Baseball Operations Matthew Silverman. Despite a low Tampa Bay payroll, Bloom consistently fielded competitive teams. The franchise had been one of the most innovative under his management; he integrated analytics into all aspects of the game. He was an early user of breakthrough strategies, now more widely used, such as a much heavier emphasis on shifts and the use of openers (starting games with relief pitchers). Bloom is also known for his prowess in developing starting pitchers. He wrote the \\"Rays Way\\" player development handbook in 2008; and during his tenure with the Rays sportswriter Tom Verducci opined that \\"no franchise understands better how to identify, develop and maintain quality pitchers.\\" In 2015, he interviewed for the G.M. position with the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers; in 2016 with the Minnesota Twins, and 2018 with the San Francisco Giants and New York Mets; Bloom was a finalist for the Mets' position. In 2019, he interviewed for the Boston Red Sox' head of baseball operations position. Boston Red Sox On October 25, 2019, the Red Sox hired the 36-year-old Bloom as Chief Baseball Officer, succeeding Dave Dombrowski as head of their baseball operations, with Brian O'Halloran to be named general manager and reporting to him. The Red Sox made an official announcement on October 28, an off-day of the 2019 World Series. In 2019, Bloom's Tampa Bay team had the lowest payroll on opening day at $49 million, while Dombrowski's Boston had the highest at $187 million.

It is also known as Stumpeenadaff (). The Hag's Tooth is situated in the Hag's Glen beside the Eagle's Nest corrie of Carrauntoohil, and is part of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks in Kerry.  Geography  Looking at the Eagle's Nest corrie (in shade), surrounded by Carrauntoohil (l), The Bones and the Beenkeragh Ridge (centre, back), Beenkeragh (r), and the Hag's Tooth, and the Hag's Tooth Ridge up to Beenkeragh (right). Knockbrinnea is far right. The Hag's Tooth is a distinctive triangular rock feature encountered when walking through the Hag's Glen on the way to climbing Carrauntoohil , Ireland's highest mountain, via the classic Devil's Ladder route. The Hag's Tooth rock is described as \\"remarkably unstable\\". The steep and narrow rocky ridge from the Hag's Tooth up to the summit of Beenkeragh, is referred to as the Hag's Tooth Ridge (see photo opposite). Because of the low prominence of the Hag's Tooth, it only qualifies as a mountain on the Vandeleur-Lynam classification--Irish peaks over , and with prominence over ; a threshold that the Hag's Tooth just meets.

The Eagle's Nest corrie consists of three distinct levels, with the top level containing Lough Cummeenoughter, Ireland's highest lake. The narrow rocky ridge from the Hag's Tooth up to the summit of Beenkeragh, the Hag's Tooth Ridge, is regarded for its scrambling, and for its views into the Eagle's Nest area and the major gullies of Carrauntoohil's north-east face. The route also enables a loop to be completed by continuing across the infamous Beenkeragh Ridge to Carrauntoohil, and then descending via the Heavenly Gates, back into the Hag's Glen. However, it is also a dangerous route and has been the scene of accidents.

Background The great economic depression caused by the World War I brought miseries to the rural people of Sindh as they were unable to pay taxes and purchase day-to-day needs, other than grain which was the only source of survival produced by themselves. Thus from the year 1917-1942, all agricultural land-owners drowned in the heavy debts by mortgaging their lands with the urban traders mainly Hindus. As this economic depression spread over the upcoming decades and another great war broke out among the European and Asian powers the more and more people mortgaged their lands and as debts could not be repaid, the lands were transferred to the money lenders by the civil courts and who by year 1947 owned 40% of agricultural land in Sindh. Legislation The Sind Provincial Legislative Assembly was established in 1937 under the India Act of 1935. Muhammad Hashim Gazdar, a member from Karachi tabled the Land Alienation bill in Legislative Assembly. Assembly passed that bill recommending returns of the mortgaged lands to owners, who had thus lost them between 1917 and 1947, free of compensation, on the plea that money lenders had already made more money than the original amount and thus repayment was not justified. This created a split between Hindus and Muslim members of the assembly. Aftermath The bill for restoring the mortgaged lands to the owners was not allowed to become operative as a law by the newly-formed Government of Pakistan. The bill awaited formal assent of the Indian Viceroy in 1947, to go into effect as a law but the newly arrived Indian Viceroy left the decision of the implementation of the bill to the upcoming government of Pakistan. After the formation of Pakistan, alienation bill came up for the required assent before Jinnah as Governor General of Pakistan but was turned down by the Jinnah on the advice of Liaquat Ali Khan. Thereby, the 40% agricultural land transferred in the possession of outgoing Hindus in the rural areas of Sindh, lost by the Muslim Sindhi farmers due to mortgages, was allotted to the immigrants from India.

It was constructed as part of the Nossa Senhora de Escada sugar plantation by L√°zaro Ar√©volo, likely in 1566; he donated the chapel to the Jesuits in the late 16th century. The chapel is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S√£o Salvador da Bahia; it was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1962. It and the Church and Monastery of Our Lady of Monserrate are the only remaining 16th-century chapels in Salvador. History The chapel was the scene of an invasion by Dutch forces during their takeover of Salvador as part of the Dutch occupation of Brazil. John Maurice, Prince of Nassau- Siegen, used the site to invade Salvador in April and May 1638. A stone plaque was placed on an exterior wall in 1930 to commemorate the event. Structure The chapel includes a nave, altar, sacristy, choir, enclosed porch, and belfry. The chapel, with its enclosed porch, resembles the Chapel of Our Lady of Help (Capela de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda) in Cachoeira; Chapel of Saint Joseph of Jenipapo (Capela de S√£o Jos√© do Jenipapo) in Castro Alves; and the Chapel of Saint Antony of Vel√°squez in Vera Cruz, Itaparica Island. An image of Our Lady of the Ladder dates to the 18th century. The pulpit is accessed via an outer stair. Protected status The National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage restored the fa√ßade of the chapel in 1966, removing its Baroque-style pediment and restoring its design, in theory, to its original form. Further work was carried out to stabilize the building structure due to the risk of collapse in 2007.

After being spotted playing amateur football, he signed for Cardiff City in 1948 where he made his professional debut. He was sold to Scunthorpe United in 1950 and scored the club's first- ever goal in the Football League. He later joined Shrewsbury Town where he finished his professional career at the age of 27. Early life Gorin was born in Cardiff, but was initially raised in Saundersfoot in West Wales. His family returned to Cardiff, settling in the Canton area of the city, and Gorin attended Grange National School and later Howard Garden's Grammar School. After leaving school, he worked as a print setter for the South Wales Echo and the Western Mail. During World War II, he was recruited to the Royal Corps of Signals. Career After finishing his service, Gorin returned to his job with the Western Mail and began playing football for local amateur side Grange Albion. He finished as the club's top goalscorer for two consecutive seasons and his form prompted Football League Second Division side Cardiff City to sign him in October 1948. He made his professional debut for the club on 27 November 1948, playing in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Coventry City. He scored his first goal in his second appearance, a 2‚Äì2 draw with Leicester City on 11 December 1948, but only made two further appearances during the 1948‚Äì49 season, both coming in the Welsh Cup. The following season, Gorin again struggled to break into the first team, making his first appearances of the season in consecutive 1‚Äì0 defeats to Barnsley and West Ham United in November 1949. He made three further appearances during the season, scoring in his final match for the club during a 1‚Äì1 draw with Hull City on the final day of the season. He signed for Scunthorpe United, newly elected to the Football League, in July 1950 with manager Leslie Jones paying ¬£2,500 to bring him to the club. After Scunthorpe drew their first match 0‚Äì0, Gorin scored the club's first goal in the Football League during a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Lincoln City in their second league match. A month later, he scored the club's first hat-trick in the Football League in a 3‚Äì0 victory over Accrington Stanley. He finished the season as the club's leading goalscorer but decided to move to Shrewsbury Town in order to be closer to Wales. However, following the death of his father, Gorin gave up playing at the age of 27 in order to return to Cardiff and care for his mother. Personal life During his time playing for Cardiff, Gorin met his wife Blodwen Chapman. After moving to Scunthorpe, he was initially stopped from returning home but made an agreement with his manager that if he scored a hat-trick in a match against Accrington Stanley he would be allowed to visit. Gorin duly obliged and was allowed to visit home after the game. The pair married in 1951. He was also a keen baseball player, playing for local teams and representing Wales on two occasions, in 1951 and 1954. After retiring from football, Gorin became the landlord of The Big Windsor pub in Cardiff. He later worked in the same role at the Bird In Hand pub, owned by Brains Brewery, the Gower Hotel and the Romilly. He suffered from dementia in later life and died on 30 May 2013 in Cardiff.

Biography Alttoa graduated from Hugo Treffner Gymnasium in 1966. His class teacher was Liidia Tanim√§e, a legendary physics teacher during the days of the Estonian SSR. After graduating from secondary school, he attended the University of Tartu in the same year and graduated in 1972 with an art history degree, protecting his diploma paper \\"Vastseliina Fortress\\". In October 1980, Alttoa was a signatory of the Letter of 40 Intellectuals, a public letter in which forty prominent Estonian intellectuals defended the Estonian language and protested the Russification policies of the Kremlin in Estonia. The signatories also expressed their unease against Republic-level government in harshly dealing with youth protests in Tallinn that were sparked a week earlier due to the banning of a public performance of the punk rock band Propeller. Alttoa has mainly studied the medieval architecture of Estonia, such as forts and sacral buildings. In 1995, while working at the university, he completed his master's thesis on medieval brick buildings in southern Estonia. He has also led several archaeological excavations at Viljandi Castle, Hermann Castle, Vastseliina Castle, and elsewhere. Alttoa was a researcher at the Tartu Branch of Estonian Construction Municipalities from 1971 to 1990, and from 1975 to 1980, he was also the senior teacher of the Estonian SSR State Art Institute. He has also been the head of Anton Starkopf Museum in Tartu. Since 1977, he has been working at the University of Tartu. By the end of the 1980s, he became a lecturer in art history at the University of Tartu. From 2005 to 2007, he was the head of their Department of Art History. He was also one of the editors of the Castella Maris Baltici series publishing international bird surveys. From 1968 to 1972, Alttoa was a member of the Tartu-based art group Visarid as a theorist and translator. In 1980, he became a signatory to the Letter of 40 intellectuals.

She moved to Leningrad (now St. Petersburg, Russia), and later to Moscow, and to the Netherlands... Life Vita was born in Dnepropetrovsk, USSR, now Ukraine. Buivid has been engaged in contemporary art since the late 1980s, initially photography and photo-based art. In the early 1990s, she began to add to her work watercolour, oil, textiles and collage, not limited by pure print. Since 1990 she has taken part in numerous exhibitions in Russia and worldwide. In 1994, Vita received a grant from the CIRC Foundation promoting cultural exchange between Russia and the Netherlands and worked on a project regarding the influence of Dutch art on Russian culture. With support from Rutgers University, she travelled to New York to work on a photo project, and also was influenced by fashion photography and started to work with local fashion magazines on her return to Russia. In 2000 Vita received a grant from la Mairie de Paris and spent two months at the Cit√© internationale des arts residence working on project ¬´Paris. Red¬ª and produced a limited edition artist book. Vita Buivid is considered to be one of the forward-thinking feminists in Russian art.

The project occupied five floors of the museum venue on Ermolaevsky, 17 and contained projects, created by the author from the early 1990s till the present time. It is the first time when the oeuvre of the artist is presented in such a full. The works by the artist can be attributed to the photo-based art. However, every time the artist manages to expand the borders of the genre. In her artworks, the aesthetics are united with the expressive and unfinished ¬´democratic¬ª photography. However, this form is filled with the in-depth content of different levels of perception. Each series by the artist is a social and cultural narrative, revealing details of the bohemian lifestyle, family conflicts, personal experiences, which turns into large-scale research, able to move the audience from the emotional maturity to existential.

Early life and education  Huntly grew up in rural Michigan. She spent time on her grandparents‚Äô farm where she enjoyed being outside and exploring nature. She received a BA in Biology from Kalamazoo College in 1977, and earned a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from University of Arizona in 1985. Her PhD dissertation was entitled The influence of herbivores on plant communities: experimental studies of a subalpine meadow ecosystem. It examined the consistency of foraging habits of the Pika with the predictions of central place foraging theory.  Career and research  Today Huntly serves as a Professor of Biology and director of the Ecology Center at Utah State University. Her research focuses on ecology and biodiversity, the food web, species interactions, and human ecology, especially in arid and alpine places. An especially notable area of her study is her foundational research on food web structures and how they impact habitat restoration as part of river restoration initiatives, which is critical to an emerging understanding of environmental management in the Columbia River Basin. In 2012, Huntly and colleagues found that a lack of recognition of three factors act as obstacles to river restoration: contaminants, habitat carrying capacity, and hybrid food webs. These findings lay the foundation for active approaches to ecosystem management which prioritize protection rather than reclamation. Before her work at Utah State University, Huntly worked on the Northwest Power and Conservation Council's Independent Scientific Review Panel of the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program. In addition, she worked on the Independent Scientific Advisory Board of the Columbia River Indian Tribes and NOAA Fisheries.

She is also the current curator of the Polar Rock Repository. Grunow is a geologist specializing in Antarctic tectonics, with her research using methods from geochronology and paleomagnetism.  Early life and education  Anne Marie Grunow was born to Willard Grunow and Loris M. Grunow, and she grew up on a potato farm in the Pomona section of Galloway Township, New Jersey and graduated from Absegami High School in 1977, where she preferred history over science and math. In her undergraduate years at Wellesley College, she developed a commitment to geology, which she viewed as being the history of the earth. Her attachment to the outdoors comes from her childhood when she lived on a farm. This aligned well with the extensive fieldwork that a geology degree required. Grunow graduated from Wellesley College in 1981 and received a bachelor's degree in Geology, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude. She then continued her education at Columbia University in New York City which marked the beginning of her travels to Antarctica in 1983. Her first Antarctic field season in 1983 was part of a joint US-UK expedition to West Antarctica where Grunow was the first woman to work in a remote field camp with British Antarctic Survey scientists. Grunow was the first woman to visit many of the remote West Antarctic outcrops in the Ellworth-Whitmore mountains, Thurston Island/Jones Mtns and Pine Island Bay. In 1989 she received her Doctorate (PhD) in Geology. Grunow worked under advisors Ian W.D. Dalziel and Dennis V. Kent on her dissertation entitled: Aspects of the evolution of the West Antarctic margin of Gondwanaland. Following this, Grunow received a Post Doctoral Fellowship from 1991 to 1993 with NATO in Geology at the University of Oxford. She later worked with Terry Wilson and Richard E. Hanson on the research paper: Gondwana assembly: The View from Southern Africa and East Gondwana. Their work was published in the Journal of Geodynamics in 1997.  Career and research  In 1989, she started as a university postdoctoral fellow and then research scientist at Ohio State University in the Byrd Polar Research Center. Now a senior research scientist at Ohio State, she is also the curator of the Polar Rock Repository and the Magnetic Data from Subglacial Clasts, West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Her expertise includes geology and earth science, geochronology, tectonics, paleomagnetism, and polar geology. Her research centers on Antarctic Tectonics and she has led research teams to the Antarctic Peninsula and the Transantartic Mountains. Some of Anne Grunow's most cited and notable work includes her research on Pan-African deformation and the potential links to the lapetus opening. This research centered around data collections dating back to the late Neoproterozoic era, and how they demonstrated a temporal correlation between Pan-African deformation and the Iapetus ocean basin closing. Another one of Grunow's most cited research paper was on the changing magmatic and tectonic styles along the paleo‚ÄêPacific margin of Gondwana and the onset of early Paleozoic magmatism in Antarctica. This research focused on the early Cambrian Period tectonics and its association with volcanic arc magmatism . Her research has also been implemented in the Global Change Master Directory and published in Journal of Geophysical Research. Her work was also noted by the United States Antarctic Program, which commented on the benefit of her work and the Polar Rock Repository's ability to provide samples from Antarctica to a variety of scientific sources for study. Grunow was also active in tectonics research of the Avalon Terrane in New England with Wellesley College mentor, Margaret Thompson.

The first woman to earn a PhD in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she was one of the founding scientists at the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and was elected as an academician in 1980. Her husband Wu Zhonghua was also an accomplished physicist and CAS academician. Early life and education Li was born on 2 November 1917 in Wu County (now Suzhou), Jiangsu, China. She graduated from Wu Pen Girls' School in Shanghai and was admitted to Tsinghua University in 1935. After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Tsinghua and several other universities evacuated Beijing and moved south to Kunming, Yunnan Province, where they combined their diminished resources to form the temporary National Southwestern Associated University (Lianda). Deeply affected by Japanese aggression, Li chose to study aeronautical engineering in order to contribute to China's national defense. She was among the first class of students to graduate from Lianda's Department of Aeronautical Engineering in 1940, and was hired as a faculty member by the university. In 1943, she married Wu Zhonghua, a fellow physicist and Tsinghua/Lianda alumnus and faculty member. Career in the United States In 1944, Li and Wu went to the United States to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Li studied mechanical engineering, while Wu specialized in the internal combustion engine. She gave birth to two sons while at MIT, and the couple took turns looking after the children. She earned her master's degree in 1945 and her ScD (PhD-equivalent) in 1948, overcoming then-prevalent sexual discrimination and becoming the first female MIT student to earn a PhD in mechanical engineering. After graduation from MIT, Li and Wu both joined the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, the predecessor of NASA) as research scientists. She published several NACA reports, and was elected to the Sigma Xi honor society. With the outbreak of the Korean War, relations between the US and the newly established People's Republic of China turned openly hostile, and Li and Wu decided they could no longer work for the US military. They resigned from NACA and became professors at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1951. In 1954, they resolved to return to China. To avoid suspicion of the US government, the family flew to Britain in August ostensibly for a vacation. From there they traveled through Switzerland and Austria to Czechoslovakia, finally arriving in Beijing at the end of the year via the Soviet Union.  Career in China  Back in China, Li and Wu were received by Premier Zhou Enlai. She joined the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), which was being established by Qian Xuesen and Qian Weichang, and served as head of the plasticity group, one of the four research groups under the institute. In 1958, Li was appointed head of solid mechanics at the newly established University of Science and Technology of China. In 1959, she became a senior scientist at the First Design Institute of the CAS and participated in the design of China's satellite launch system. She was elected an academician of the CAS in 1980. Li made major contributions to aerospace research in China. Her paper \\"General plastic behaviour and method of solution for plane stress problems with axial symmetry in strain hardening range considering finite strain\\" won the State Natural Science Award (third class) in 1956. In 1959, she led a team that designed China's first instantaneous heat load testing system for the satellite carrier rocket. In the 1970s, she developed a method to analyze defects in aerospace turbomachinery, and won the 1978 Major Achievement Award from the CAS. Her research on engine defects led to her later focus on material fatigue, which she extensively researched until she was in her eighties. Starting in 1982, she organized a biennial national conference on material fatigue. Li died on 19 January 2013, at the age of 95.

The name of the publication came from the cry ¬°Arriba Espa√±a!, a motto that was associated with the Falangist ideology. In its early days, it coined the motto Por Dios y el C√©sar. History The newspaper was born in the summer of 1936, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The newspaper La Voz de Navarra (organ of expression of the Basque Nationalist Party in the region) had been seized by the Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS on 20 July. In these facilities, the Falange would publish a new newspaper, Arriba Espa√±a. Its first issue was released on 1 August 1936. Originally edited under the subtitle Hoja de Combate de F.E. de las J.O.N.S, it would be configured as the organ of expression of Falange in Navarra. With time, it would end up becoming one of the main Falange publications of the rebel zone. The direction of the new newspaper fell to the Pamplonan clergyman Ferm√≠n Yzurdiaga, as well as to the Pamplonan journalist and writer √Ångel Mar√≠a Pascual. Arriba Espa√±a was the first daily newspaper that the Falange counted in. It was a pioneer as a disseminating publication of the Falangist ideology in the rebel zone after the beginning of the war. In its editorial line, anti-Marxist, but also anti- Semitic and anti-Masonic approaches were manifested. In its first copy, the ideology of the same was clear: In November 1936, after the proliferation of the bonfires, from the pages of the publication had to ask for restraint and to respect private libraries. However, as the struggle progressed, the newspaper maintained the dialectic of the first days. On 25 May 1937, it declared: Yzurdiaga and Pascual would be the architects of the newspaper, although throughout the battle, a large number of writers and poets from the rebellious side would collaborate in Arriba Espa√±a, as was the case of Pedro La√≠n Entralgo, Dionisio Ridruejo or Eugeni d'Ors, among others. Many of those who collaborated with the newspaper also did so with the magazine Jerarqu√≠a (the \\"Black Magazine of the Falange\\"), which, like the newspaper, was also directed by Ferm√≠n Yzurdiaga. After the Civil War, the newspaper Arriba Espa√±a continued as a disseminator of the slogans of Falangism. In Francoist Spain, it became part of the Cadena de Prensa del Movimiento. However, over the years the newspaper was losing readership and slowly entered a strong decline from its previous era. By 1974, the newspaper accumulated losses of over twelve million pesetas (over seventy-two thousand euros). A year later, in 1975, the bad economic situation of the newspaper led Emilio Romero (at that time the National Press Delegate of the Movimiento) to make the decision to close the Arriba Espa√±a. On 1 July 1975, the last issue was published.

The Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil had the objective of killing Fulgencio Batista. The attack failed. According to one of the attackers, Faure Chom√≥n of the Revolutionary Directorate, they were following the golpe arriba strategy and together with Menelao Mora Morales sought to overthrow the government by killing President Fulgencio Batista. Plan The Presidential Palace The plan, as explained by Faure Chaum√≥n Mediavilla, was to attack the Presidential Palace by a commando of fifty men and simultaneously support the operation by one hundred men occupying the radio station Radio Reloj at the Radiocentro CMQ Building to announce the death of Batista. The attack on the palace would result in the elimination of Fulgencio Batista, the purpose of taking of Radio Reloj, was to announce the death of Batista and to call for a general strike, to incite the people of Havana to join the armed struggle. The plan to capture of the Presidential Palace by up of fifty men, under the direction of Carlos Guti√©rrez Menoyo and Faure Chom√≥n, this command was to be supported by a group of 100 armed men whose function would be to occupy the tallest buildings in the surrounding area of the Presidential Palace (La Tabacalera, the Sevilla Hotel, the Palace of Fine Arts) and, from these positions, support the main command taking over the Presidential Palace. However, this support operation was not carried out as the men who were to participate never arrived at the scene of the events because of last-minute hesitation. Although the revolutionaries reached the third floor of the Palace, they could not execute Batista. An implied goal of the attack had been to penetrate to Batista's study located on the second floor at the northeast corner of the building.

They spoke in code order to frustrate a potential infiltration or a divulging of the attack in any conversation, it had been agreed early on that they would refer to Palacios as \\"la casa de los tres kilos.\\" Reprisal The failed attack provoked a strong reprisal by the Batista police as they launched one of the worst waves of repression and violence Havana had experienced. Police squads, on their own initiative, went after opposition leaders who had not participated in the attack, including Carlos M√°rquez-Sterling. One of the casualties was an attorney and former senator Dr. Pelayo Cuervo Navarro, a figure in the opposition and leader of the \\"Ortodoxo\\" Party.

Following is a report: Golpeando Arriba On January 22, 1959, Fidel Castro explained to journalists gathered in the Copa Room of the Havana Riviera hotel, among other topics, that hitting up, \\"golpear arriba,\\" was one of the \\"false concepts about the revolution\\" because \\"tyranny is not a man; tyranny is a system (...) We were never supporters of tyrannicide or military coups, [which tended] to inculcate the people a complex of impotence \\" A few months earlier Castro had reprimanded Guevara for having signed a pact with Rolando Cubela, Chomon's lieutenant in the DR-13-3 guerrilla in Escambray mountains, the \\"Pacto del Pedrero\\". The letter is dated in Palma Soriano on December 26, 1958, in its crucial passage reads: Gallery File:Jose_Antonio_Echevarria.2._Dead_March_13,_1957,_Havana,_Cuba.jpg|Jose Antonio Echevarria.

In 2007 the holiday was voted into law as a new national holiday. It is a non-working day.  Historical Background  The holiday is celebrated on the occasion of the formation of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization in Thessaloniki. On October 23, 1893 six young men gathered at the home of the bookstore owner Ivan Had≈æi Nikolov in Thessaloniki in order to form the basis which would later become the symbol and flag for the struggle for Macedonian freedom. The founders were: * Hristo Tatarƒçev * Dame Gruev * Petar Pop Arsov * Ivan Had≈æi Nikolov * Anton Dimitrov * Hristo Batand≈æiev They formed a covert group, calling it the Macedonian Revolotionary Organization The organization fought for the freedom of Macedonia without foreign help. The formation of the Macedonian Revolutionary Organization was the beginning of an organized Macedonian revolutionary movement which, via the Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising the Kru≈°evo Republic and, later, World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia, resulted in the creation of the modern independent Macedonian state. This date, October 23, is connected with the organized struggle of the peoples living in Macedonia to create an independent state.  Controversy  Because this day is considered the beginning of IMRO, the Macedonian public was somewhat reserved in declaring this day a national holiday. The Macedonian opposition at the time, led by Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, were wholly against the declaration because the opposition considered it the birthday of the right-wing party VMRO-DPMNE. As such, it was considered inappropriate to celebrate it as a national holiday. Some Macedonian public figures espoused the view, this celebration is related to the ideas of the Bulgarian nationalism.–ü—Ä–∞–∑–Ω–∏–∫ –≤–æ —Å–ª—É–∂–±–∞ –Ω–∞ –≥–æ–ª–µ–º–æ–±—É–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –∏–¥–µ—ò–∞, –ì—Ä—É–ø–∞ –ø—Ä–≤–æ–±–æ—Ä—Ü–∏ –∏ –ø—Ä–µ—Ä–æ–¥–±–µ–Ω–∏—Ü–∏, –£—Ç—Ä–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –≤–µ—Å–Ω–∏–∫, –ë—Ä–æ—ò 2228 —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∞, 08 –Ω–æ–µ–º–≤—Ä–∏ 2006. In Bulgaria are also some objections against this way of celebration. It appears that IMRO have originally been called \\"Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees\\".Who are the Macedonians? Hugh Poulton, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2000, , p. 53. IMRO was active not only in Macedonia but also in Thrace and initially the membership in the organization was restricted only for Bulgarians.Its first name was \\"Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees\\", which was later changed several times. IMRO was active not only in Macedonia but also in Thrace (the Vilayet of Adrianople). Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between ‚ÄòMacedonians‚Äô and ‚ÄòBulgarians‚Äô. Moreover, as their own writings attest, they often saw themselves and their compatriots as ‚ÄòBulgarians‚Äô. All of them wrote in standard Bulgarian language. For more see: Brunnbauer, Ulf (2004) Historiography, Myths and the Nation in the Republic of Macedonia. In: Brunnbauer, Ulf, (ed.) (Re)Writing History. Historiography in Southeast Europe after Socialism. Studies on South East Europe, vol. 4. LIT, M√ºnster, pp. 165-200 .382587365X. Contrary to the impression of Macedonian researchers who believe that the Internal organization espoused \\"Macedonian national consciousness,\\" the local revolutionaries during Ottoman times declared their belief, that the majority of the Slavic Christian population of Macedonia was \\"Bulgarian.\\"Tschavdar Marinov, We the Macedonians, The Paths of Macedonian Supra-Nationalism (1878‚Äì1912), in \\"We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe\\" with Mishkova Diana as ed., Central European University Press, 2009, , pp. 107-137. The modern Macedonian historiographic claim of close relationship between the IMRO demands for autonomy with the creation of a separate ethnic Macedonian state, does not correspond with historical records.Contrary to the assertions of Skopje's historiography, Macedonian revolutionaries clearly manifested Bulgarian national identity. Their Macedonian autonomism and ‚Äúseparatism‚Äù represented a strictly supranational project, not national. Entangled Histories of the Balkans:, Roumen Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov, BRILL, 2013, , p. 303.There is, moreover, the not less complicated issue of what autonomy meant to the people who espoused it in their writings. According to Hristo Tatarchev, their demand for autonomy was motivated not by an attachment to Macedonian national identity but out of concern that an explicit agenda of unification with Bulgaria would provoke other small Balkan nations and the Great Powers to action. Macedonian autonomy, in other words, can be seen as a tactical diversion, or as ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù of Bulgarian unification. ƒ∞pek Yosmaoƒülu, Blood Ties: Religion, Violence and the Politics of Nationhood in Ottoman Macedonia, 1878‚Äì1908, Cornell University Press, 2013, , pp. 15-16. In this relation, the Bulgarian side has made several proposals that some shared historical events (e.g. the foundation of IMRO) could be celebrated jointly.  Celebration  In many different parts of Macedonia the holiday is celebrated with various festivities, concerts, and sports competitions. The official festival is held in the Macedonian Opera and Ballet, where major national figures and historians from the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts give speeches.

It was published in 1985. It represents, in one critic's view, \\"the poetry proper to the art of Kolt√®s ... cold and pithy ... proceeding more from the wanderings of the characters than from their words\\". A quote from Victor Hugo serves as one of several epitaphs to the text: \\"He stops to get his bearings. All of a sudden he looks at his feet. His feet have disappeared.\\" (). Others come from the Book of Genesis (6:13) and Burning Spear. Plot There are eight characters. * Maurice Koch, 60 years old; Monique Pons, 42. * C√©cile, 60; her daughter Claire, 14; her husband Rodolfe, 58; and their son Charles, 28. * A boy about 22 with the surname Fak. * An unnamed man about 30, whom Charles calls Abad a few times. The setting, a derelict warehouse in an abandoned section of a port city, is a kind of character as well, both space and non-space, empty but real. Plot, wrote one critic, \\"was never Kolt√®s's strength\\", yet he essayed a brief summation: \\"a suicidal financial wizard and his girlfriend, a homeless Latin American family and two creepy opportunists engage in a hellish but often funny battle in which everyone is both predator and prey\\", concluding with \\"a couple of spectacular murders that seem so natural they are cathartic\\". Another offers this precis: \\"The action tells the story of Maurice Koch, a businessman who jumps into a river after parting from his secretary Monique Pons. He is pulled out by Charles, whose relatives hope to gain from the rescue. The plot is based on exchange and trafficking and plays on the apprehension of the other and of oneself.\\" The characters come from opposing worlds and never should have met. Their face-to-face encounter forces the conflicts of the modern world to the fore: immigration, social displacement, poverty, the right to dignity. The director is challenged to present this chance meeting \\"at the crossroads of trivial and poetic\\" and needs \\"actors-monsters\\" with \\"an exceptional physical and vocal presence\\" to deliver Koltes' \\"splendid text\\", often in the long monologues typical of Koltes. Performances and reception The play premiered at the in Amsterdam early in 1986. It was next mounted in a production directed by Patrice Ch√©reau at the Th√©√¢tre Nanterre-Amandiers from 24 April to 29 June 1986. The Nanterre cast included Mar√≠a Casar√®s, Jean-Marc Thibault, Jean-Paul Roussillon, Catherine Hi√©gel, and Isaach de Bankol√©. West Pier was one of four plays by Koltes presented in a tribute festival in New York City in 2003. Those involved produced new translations because, they said, \\"limp British translations have stymied interest\\" in Koltes' work. A positive review in the New York Times said that \\"The cast gives these characters the entrancing energy of subtle maniacs\\" in the course of \\"a mordant, violently physical exploration of lost people searching for connections\\", saved by Koltes' \\"aptitude for dramatic confrontation\\". It praised the new translation used in 2003: \\"Kolt√®s now sounds like Dante speaking in the voice of Sam Shepard\\". It concluded: \\"How often can you sit through two hours, count them 30 minutes and lament that they've ended?\\"  Adaptations  Composer R√©gis Campo adapted the play for his second opera Quai Ouest in 2013‚Äì2014. The work received its first performance on 27 September 2014 at the Op√©ra national du Rhin directed by Kristian Fr√©dric during the festival Musica √† Strasbourg. It was repeated during the 2014-2015 season in a German translation at the Staatstheater N√ºrnberg. The thirty-scene libretto for the opera was adapted from the play by Kristian Fr√©dric et Florence Doublet. Carolyn Sittig produced the German version of the libretto based on a translation of the French libretto by Simon Werle. On the basis of this opera, Campo was nominated for the award of composer of the year at the Victoires de la musique classique for 2015.

She earned her PhD from the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at University of Colorado, Boulder. She is the co-founder of the non-profit organization, 500 Women Scientists.  Early life and education  Tamara Jane Zelikova was born on March 24, 1978 to a Jewish family in Ukraine. Zelikova's family moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 1990, when she was 12 years old. She credits being an immigrant Jew as a significant part of her identity. She has previously said that she was an active child, and says that her curiosity about the way the world works was a factor in her interest in ecosystem science. Zelikova attended and graduated from the University of Georgia with a degree in ecology. She later received her PhD Ifrom University of Colorado Boulder in ecology and evolutionary biology.  Career and research  Zelikova is an ecosystem scientist, filmmaker, and activist. She is a research scientist at the University of Wyoming. Her research primarily focuses on understanding the impacts of climate change on ecological systems, and studying the ways that both organisms, plants and biogeochemical cycles respond. Zelikova credits Michael Breed and Nathan Sanders as her mentors while at CU Boulder. Zelikova's research examines how ecosystems are responding to change. Zelikova and her colleagues found that in a mixed grass prairie the plant community was more stable under increased carbon dioxide conditions. They also found more \\"evenness\\" in plant species. This is important because grassland prairie communities are valuable due to their plant community composition and amount of key forage species. and thus we need to understand how they respond to disturbance related climate change. In another study examining how invasive species respond to climate change, her and her team found that the invasive species growth was much more limited than they expected under warming conditions, mainly due to many features of climate change, including temperature, precipitation, soil texture, and plant demography, illustrating the interconnected nature of plant and animal responses to climate change. Another example of where her work focuses on these interactions includes her work in tropical lowland forests where she is examining the role of leafcutter ants to carbon dioxide and methane emissions, and how their nests change the landscape and in doing so, alter the processing of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. More recently, Zelikova's research focuses on climate change mitigation, specifically how to promote greater carbon uptake in soil.  500 Women Scientists  Zelikova is well-known for co-founding 500 Women Scientists. Following President Trump's election in 2016 Zelikova and her colleague Kelly Ramirez formed 500 Women Scientists. They founded this after having concerns about women in STEM and the hateful rhetoric expressed in Trumps campaign, including sexism, disrespect, and attacks on minorities and immigrants. Globally, they have 165 pods that works together, and 111 in the United States.  End of Snow  Through a production company that she co-founded, \\"Hey Girl Productions\\" Zelikova released a film entitled End of Snow. End of Snow is a short film that follows a number of characters, including a paleoecologist, a rancher, and a man collecting snowfall data in the Southwest as they deal with the impacts of climate change. End of Snow won many awards, including the Best Editing award for an International Wildlife Film Festival, Vancouver International Mountain Film Festival Finalist 2018, and the Ekotopfilm Envirofilm 2017 award.  Activism and other ventures  Zelikova spent a year and a half working on policy in Washington, DC while she was an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow. She was working there when the Paris agreement was signed, however she left shortly into the Trump administration after becoming frustrated with the administrations stance on climate. Zelikova is also a co-founder of LUCA Media Collective, a non-profit media company that focuses on \\"supporting stories\\". Additionally, Zelikova developed a special course in Costa Rica on science communication that teaches students how to effectively communicate their research with policymakers and people in power.  Awards  Zelikova has won numerous awards both for her activism and her contributions to science. She was awarded the Grist 50 2018 award. She is listed under their \\"strategist\\" section for co-founding 500 Women Scientists. Grist lists one of the most impressive parts of 500 Women Scientists as their \\"request a scientist feature\\", which connects journalists, policymakers, and others to top female scientists around the world. Zelikova was a Mendenhall fellow at the United States Geological Service from 2010 to 2012 and a AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow at the U.S. Department of Energy. She also won the 2018 Science Media Awards and Summit In the Hub fellow, for her innovative way of connecting science and media to tell stories, and promoting open, easy, science. Jane was recognized on the 2018 Bitch50 Bitch Media list for her work building the Request a Woman Scientist platform.

After a large fire in 1864, a new structure was built, and was the largest train station in the United States until construction of Grand Central Depot in New York City in 1871. The depot was operated by multiple railroads until 1930, when all except the Pennsylvania Railroad dropped their services and utilized Cleveland Union Terminal, which opened that year. The Pennsylvania Railroad continued to use the depot until 1953, and the building was demolished in 1959.  Services  * Cleveland and Toledo Railroad (1853 - 1869) * Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad (1853 - 1868) * Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad / Lake Shore Railway (1853 - 1869) * Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad (1853 - 1871) * Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway (1868 - 1889) * Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway (1869 - 1914) * Pennsylvania Company (1871 - 1918) * Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (1889 - 1930) * New York Central (1914 - 1930) * Pennsylvania Railroad (1918 - 1953)  History  Before 1853, the railroads serving the city each maintained its own small depot. The first union depot cost $75,000, and consisted of a group of wooden sheds centrally located at the foot of the hill where Bank (current-day West 6th) and Water (current-day West 9th) Streets met the lake shore. This depot was built from 1851 to 1853, and partially burned in 1864. The remaining structures were retained for housing, cleaning, and repairing traincars, and a replacement station was constructed of masonry nearby. It opened in 1866, with a final cost of $475,000, and was dedicated on November 10 of that year. The opening was celebrated with a banquet for 300 in the station's dining hall. In 1867, the depot's tower was constructed. During the Civil War, the station was utilized to transport thousands of soldiers to training camps. Additionally, in December 1863, the Cleveland's Soldiers Aid Society constructed the Soldier's Home, a shelter and relief center offering food, clothing, shelter, and medical care to soldiers. U.S. President Abraham Lincoln used the terminal in departing Cleveland during his first inaugural tour throughout the country, on his way to Washington, D. C. After the war, the station was used to carry Lincoln's body on his funeral train to Springfield, Illinois. By the 1890s, Union Depot was too small for the number of trains and people coming into Cleveland daily, and as it deteriorated and accumulated soot and ash, it became an embarrassment to many citizens. Plans for another depot, part of Cleveland's Group Plan, were begun, though were not completed. In the mid-1900s, the depot was renovated, which included removal of the arched train shed, replaced by individual canopies over each platform. The Van Sweringen brothers, owners of the Nickel Plate Railroad, persuaded the city and the other passenger railroads (except the Pennsylvania) to allow construction of a new train station as part of a retail and office complex at Public Square. When Cleveland Union Terminal opened in 1930, Union Depot lost the bulk of its traffic. In 1946 it was renamed Pennsylvania Station. Only the Pennsylvania Railroad continued to use the old station, until September 1953. The building was razed in 1959. New Union Depot proposal as a part of the Group Plan, before a 1919 referendum on Cleveland Union Terminal  Attributes  The station was constructed along Cleveland's lake front with Lake Erie, between modern-day 6th and 9th Streets, close to the current Amtrak station. The 1866 depot was designed and constructed by industrialist and railroad director Amasa Stone. At the time of its construction, the building measured , making it the largest building under one roof, and the largest train station, in the United States. It retained those records until Grand Central Depot was built in New York City in 1871. Thereafter it retained recognition as the largest terminal west of New York City. It was also among the first buildings to use structural iron, and had Berea Sandstone exterior walls. Its most iconic feature was a 96-foot clocktower on the south facade, topped with a tin- covered dome.

For comparison, the United Nations estimated that the human population was about 7.8 billion in 2020, up from 2.5 billion in 1950. Roughly three-quarters of all people reside in Africa and Asia in 2020. In fact, most human population growth comes from these two continents, as nations in Europe and the Americas tend to have too few children to replace themselves. Population pyramid of the world in 2018 2018 was the first time when the number of people above 65 years of age (705 million) exceeded those between the ages of zero and four (680 million). In other words, this was the first year in which there were more grandparents than grandchildren. If current trends continues, the ratio between these two age groups will top two by 2050. Fertility rates have been falling around the world thanks to rising standards of living, greater access to contraceptives, and improved educational and economic opportunities. In fact, about half of all countries had sub- replacement fertility in the mid-2010s. The global average fertility rate in 1950 was 4.7 but dropped to 2.4 in 2017. However, this average masks the huge variation between countries. Niger has the world's highest fertility rate at 7.1 while Cyprus has one of the lowest at 1.0. In general, the more developed of countries, including much of Europe, the United States, South Korea, and Australia, tend to have lower fertility rates. People in such places tend to have children later and fewer of them. However, surveys conducted in developed economies suggest that women's desired family sizes tend to be higher than their completed fertility. Stagnant wages and eroding welfare programs are the contributing factors. While some countries, such as Sweden and Singapore, have tried various incentives to raise their fertility rates, such policies have not been particularly successful. Moreover, birth rates following the COVID-19 global pandemic might drop significantly due to economic recession. Education is in fact one of the most important determinants of fertility. The more educated a woman is, the later she tends to have children, and fewer of them. At the same time, the global average life expectancy has gone from 52 in 1960 to 72 in 2017. Higher interest in education brings about an environment in which mortality rates fall, which in turns, increases population density. All these factors reduce fertility, as does cultural transmission. Increasing immigration is problematic while policies that encourage people to have more children rarely succeed. Moreover, immigration is not an option at the global level. Half of the human population lived in urban areas in 2007, and this figure became 55% in 2019. If the current trend continues, it will reach two thirds by the middle of the century. A direct consequence of urbanization is falling fertility. In rural areas, children can be considered an asset, that is, additional labor. But in the cities, children are a burden. Moreover, urban women demand greater autonomy and exercise more control over their fertility. The United Nations estimated in mid-2019 that the human population will reach about 9.7 billion by 2050, a downward revision from an older projection to account for the fact that fertility has been falling faster than previously thought in the developing world. The global annual rate of growth has been declining steadily since the late twentieth century, dropping to about one percent in 2019. In fact, by the late 2010s, 83 of the world's countries had sub-replacement fertility. During the early to mid-2010s, more babies were born to Christian mothers and those of any other religion in the world, reflecting the fact that Christianity remained the most popular religion in existence. However, it was the Muslims who had a faster rate of growth. About 33% of the world's babies were born to Christians who made up 31% of the global population between 2010 and 2015, compared to 31% to Muslims, whose share of the human population was 24%. During the same period, the religiously unaffiliated (including atheists and agnostics) made up 16% of the population but gave birth to only 10% of the world's children.  Africa  Population pyramid of Egypt in 2018 Egypt's population reached the 100-million milestone in February 2020. According to government figures, during the 1990s and 2000s, Egypt's fertility rate fell from 5.2 down to 3.0, but then rose up to 3.5 in 2018, according to the United Nations. If the current rate of growth continues, Egypt will be home to more than 128 million people by 2030. Such rapid population growth is a cause for concern in a country marked by poverty, unemployment, shortages of clean water, lack of affordable housing, and traffic congestion. Harsh geography exacerbates the problem: 95% of the population lives on just 4% of the land, a region in the neighborhood of the Nile River roughly half the size of Ireland. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi claimed that overpopulation posed as much a threat to national security as terrorism. He launched a campaign called ‚ÄúTwo Is Enough‚Äù in order to curb the problem, but to no avail. Egypt's fertility rate surged at around the Arab Spring, likely as a result of political chaos, economic uncertainty, and funds for birth control from Western governments drying up. Fertility rates remained the highest in rural areas, where children are considered a blessing, but the impact is most visible in Greater Cairo, a megalopolis home to over 20 million people. In general, Egypt's densely populated cities and towns have one million additional residents each year between 2008 and 2018. Nigeria was experiencing a population boom in the 2010s and is on track to become the world's third most populous nation by century's end, according to United Nations figures. However, this demographic trend comes with its own risks, namely environmental, health, and food security problems. Moreover, the nation is already battling deadly infectious diseases, which spread more easily with higher population densities, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and Lassa fever. Statistical projections from the United Nations in 2019 suggest that, by 2020, the people of Niger would have a median age of 15.2, Mali 16.3, Chad 16.6, Somalia, Uganda, and Angola all 16.7, the Democratic Republic of the Congo 17.0, Burundi 17.3, Mozambique and Zambia both 17.6. (This means that more than half of their populations were born in the first two decades of the twenty-first century.) Benin, Burundi, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Yemen, and Timor-Leste had a median age of 17 in 2017, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluations, University of Washington. These are the world's youngest countries by median age. While a booming population can induce substantial economic growth, if healthcare, education, and economic needs were not met, there would be chronic youth unemployment, low productivity, and social unrest. Investing in human capital is crucial. Curbing population growth could help Africa take advantage of the demographic dividend that enabled the Asian Tigers to develop so rapidly during the late twentieth century. Africa's population boom could have a significant international impact, as many of its natives seek to migrate to other countries both within and without Africa seeking a better life. While Africa is the world's most fertile region, it also has the world's highest child mortality rates. Nevertheless, Africa is largely responsible for human population growth in the twenty-first century, overtaking Asia. Moreover, sub-Saharan Africa is the only major region that is an exception to the general trend of falling family size seen around the world.  Asia  Population pyramid of China in 2018 In 2016, the Chinese Communist Party replaced one-child policy with the two-child policy; the nation's birth rate briefly surged before continuing on a downward path. In 2019, 14.65 million babies were born in China, the lowest since 1961. Although demographers and economists have urged the Chinese Central Government to eliminate all birth restrictions, they have been reluctant to do so. Economist Ren Zeping of Evergrande calculated that between 2013 and 2028, the number of Chinese women between the ages of 20 and 35 would drop by 30%. Official data is often unreliable and even self-contradictory. \\"China‚Äôs birth numbers are very sloppy and highly influenced by politics,\\" demographer Yi Fuxian of the University of Wisconsin ‚Äì Madison told the South China Morning Post. Overall, China's population grew to 1.4 billion in 2019 from 1.39 billion the year before. In a 2019 paper, Yi Fuxian estimated that China's average annual fertility rate was 1.18 between 2010 and 2018. Less than 6% of China's population was under five years old in 2018, compared to 3.85% in Japan. A Chinese person born in the late 2010s has a life expectancy of 76 years, up from 44 in 1960. According to a projection by the United Nations, China's median age would reach that of the United States in 2020 and would subsequently converge with Europe's but would remain below that of Japan. If the current trend continues, by 2050, the median age of China will be 50, compared to 42 for the United States and 38 for India. Such a trend has fueled predictions of dreadful socio-economic problems. A study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) published in January 2020 predicts that China's population would peak in 2029 at 1.44 billion, after which decline would be \\"unstoppable.\\" CASS calculated that China's population will fall to 1.36 billion by mid-century, losing almost 200 million workers. CASS recommended that the government implement policies that would address the problems of a shrinking labor force and an increasing elderly population, which means a growing dependency rate. A large and young labor force and domestic consumption have driven China's rapid economic growth. Yet due a shrinking pool of young people, China has suffered from labor shortages and reduced growth in the 2010s. Young Chinese women living in the twenty-first century tend to be reluctant to have children for a number of reasons. In large cities, such as Shanghai, people typically spend at least a third of their income on raising a child. Chinese women have become a lot more career- oriented. On top of that, Chinese work places generally do not offer accommodations for women with young children, who often face demotion or even unemployment after returning from maternity leave. Not only do shortages of young workers have implications for China's economic prospects, they also pose a serious burden on young people being born today. They will have to take care of four grandparents and two parents on their own, as their siblings will not have been born. As a result of cultural ideals, government policy, and modern medicine, there has been severe gender imbalances in China and India. According to the United Nations, in 2018, China and India had a combined 50 million of excess males under the age of 20. Such a discrepancy fuels loneliness epidemics, human trafficking (from elsewhere in Asia, such as Cambodia and Vietnam), and prostitution, among other societal problems. Population pyramid of Singapore in 2018 Singapore's total fertility rate continues to decline in the 2010s, as more and more young people are choosing to delay or eschew marriage and parenthood. It reached 1.14 in 2018, making it the lowest since 2010 and one of the lowest in the world. Reasons for this include long work hours, digital disruption, uncertainties surrounding global trade, climate change, high cost of living, and long wait times for public housing. The median age for first-time mothers rose from 29.7 in 2009 to 30.6 in 2018, which poses a problem because fertility declines with age. Meanwhile, the death rate has been increasing since 1998; Singapore now faces an aging population. In fact, Singapore's birth rate has been below the replacement level of 2.1 since the 1980s, and appears to be stabilizing by during the first two decades of the twenty-first century. Government incentives such as the baby bonus have proven insufficient to raise the birth rate. The number of women in their prime childbearing years (25‚Äì29) who remained single increased from 60.9% in 2007 to 68.1% in 2017. For men, the corresponding numbers were 77.5% and 80.7%, respectively. In Singapore, the singleness rate is a major determinant of fertility because only 10% of married couples have no children at all. While it is not unusual for men to marry late because they are expected to have established themselves before getting married and to be the primary breadwinner, one major reason why women are marrying later is because higher education eliminates the need to get married for economic survival.Also see how income affects human mating. At the 2019 Forbes Global CEO Conference, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that one of the top issues facing his country is finding the right demographic balance. \\"To secure our future, we must make our own babies, enough of them. Because if all of the next generation are not our own, then where do they come from and what is the point of this?\\" he said. Lee added that the long-term goal of his government is to maintain a workforce that is two-thirds Singaporean, with the rest being brought in from overseas. He argued that such a ratio is manageable while relaxing immigration restriction would be \\"unwise\\" because \\"there is no shortage of people who want to come.\\" Map of East Asia by total fertility rates in 2018 Population pyramid of South Korea in 2018 Singapore's experience mirrors those of Japan and South Korea. Japan at present has one of the oldest population in the world and persistently sub-replacement fertility, currently 1.4 per woman. Japan's population peaked in 2017. A baby boom occurred in the aftermath of the Korean War, and the government subsequently encouraged people to have no more than two children per couple. As a result, South Korea's fertility has been falling ever since. South Korea's fertility rate dropped below 1.0 in 2018 for the first time since that country began keeping statistics in 1970. The figure for 2017 was also a record low, at 1.05. Since 2005, the government has spent a fortune on child subsidies and campaigns promoting reproduction but without much success. Possible reasons for Korea's low fertility rate include the high cost of raising a child, high youth unemployment, the burden of childcare on career-minded women, a stressful education system, and high levels of competition in Korean society. In South Korea, because marriage is usually associated with child-rearing, it is extremely rare for children to be born out of wedlock. That figure stood at 1.9% as of 2017. By contrast, in some other developed countries, such as France and Norway, it is not uncommon for children to be born to unmarried couples, at 55% or higher. Government figures show that the average age at first marriage for women climbed from 24.8 in 1990 to 30.2 in 2018 while the age of first birth was 31.6. According to Statistics Korea, women to give birth to their first child in their early 30s are unlikely to have more than one. In Korea's traditionalist society, new mothers face discrimination in the work force, and as such delaying childbirth becomes commonplace. Such a low fertility rate endangers the nation's welfare programs (including healthcare and pensions), and causes more and more schools to close. It also has implications for national security, as the South Korean military relies on conscription to confront the North Korean threat. Population pyramid of Taiwan in 2018 According to the National Development Council of Taiwan (NDC), the nation's population could start shrinking by 2022 and the number of people of working age could fall 10% by 2027. About half of Taiwanese would be aged 50 or over by 2034. According to the NDC, Taiwan reached the stage of being an aging society ‚Äì one in which the number of people aged 65 and up is about 7% ‚Äì in 1993. Like South Korea, Taiwan has since moved from being an aging society to an aged one, where the number of elderly people exceeds 14%. It therefore takes the country just 25 years, compared to 17 for South Korea. During the 2010s, Taiwan's fertility rate hovered just above 1.0, making it one of the lowest in the world. In fact, data from the Ministry of the Interior shows it has consistently been below 1.5 since 2001. (In 2010, Taiwan's fertility rate actually fell below 1.0 because it was thought to be a bad year to have children because he previous year was considered inauspicious for marriage.) Many couples still live with their parents, and the older generation expects women to stay at home, take care of children, and do house chores. Stipends and subsidies from the government have been unsuccessful in encouraging more people to reproduce, but the government has added more money for childcare, education, and birth subsidies. The government is also considering immigration policies that attract highly skilled workers from other countries, and to make English an official language. At the current rate, Taiwan is set to transition from an aged to super-aged society, where 21% of the population is over 65 years of age, in eight years, compared to seven years for Singapore, eight years for South Korea, 11 years for Japan, 14 for the United States, 29 for France, and 51 for the United Kingdom. As of 2018, Japan was already a super- aged society, with 27% of its people being older than 65 years. According to government data, Japan's total fertility rate was 1.43 in 2017. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Japan has one of the oldest populations in the world, with a median age of 47 years in 2017. Population pyramid of Vietnam in 2018 Vietnam's population grew from 60 million in 1986 to 97 million in 2018, with the rate of growth falling to about one percent in the late 2010s. Like Bangladesh and unlike Egypt, Vietnam is a developing country that has successfully curbed its population growth. Vietnam's median age in 2018 was 26 and rising. Between the 1970s and the late 2010s, life expectancy climbed from 60 to 76. It is now the second- highest in Southeast Asia. Vietnam's fertility rate dropped from 5 in 1980 to 3.55 in 1990 and then to 1.95 in 2017. In that same year, 23% of the Vietnamese population was 15 years of age or younger, down from almost 40% in 1989. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Vietnam's population is one of the fastest aging in the world. WHO projected that the proportion of people above the age of 65 would rise from 4% in 2017 to almost 7% by 2030. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \\"Vietnam is at risk of growing old before it grows rich.\\" The share of working-age Vietnamese peaked in 2011, when the country's annual GDP per capita at purchasing power parity was $5,024, compared to $32,585 for South Korea, $31,718 for Japan, and $9,526 for China. In April 2020, Prime Minister of Vietnam Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Ph√∫c issued a decision on attaining a demographic balance by raising the fertility rate of localities that are below 2.2, what his government considers the replacement rate, and reducing the number of births in places that are above that mark. To this end, local governments are to invest in family-friendly services such as babysitting and family medicine. A 2016 report from the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs stated that Vietnam became one of the fasting aging societies on Earth in 2015. Government data showed that in 2019, Vietnam's population was 96.2 million people, the third-largest in Southeast Asia, and the fifteenth in the world. Yet many localities had fertility rate well below replacement level, such as Dong Thap (1.34), Ba Ria-Vung Tau (1.37), Ho Chi Minh City (1.36), and Hau Giang (1.57). Ph√∫c's decision discourages women from having children after the age of 35 and instead urges people to marry before the age of 30 and have children early. But some newspaper readers pointed out that such a policy ignores cultural, economic, and social realities. Reasons for Vietnam's falling fertility rate include high standards of child rearing, youth unemployment leading many to continue to live with their parents till the age of 30, career aspirations, high cost of living in the cities, concerns over national problems (such as child abuse, school violence, food safety, pollution, traffic congestion, and overcrowded hospitals), and international issues (namely overpopulation and climate change). Other rapidly growing Southeast Asian economies, such as the Philippines, saw similar demographic trends. In India, the fertility rate has fallen from 5.91 in 1960 to 2.24 in 2020. In addition, the number of women who would like to have more than one child has declined significantly. The National Family Health Survey of 2018 found that only 24% of Indian women were interested in having a second child, down from 68% a decade prior. Nine states ‚Äì Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh ‚Äì found their fertility rate to be below the replacement level in 2018. In general, India's falling fertility is correlated with increasing women's literacy rates and level of education, rising economic prosperity, improved mobility, and later marriage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been urging couples to have fewer children to make sure they are better taken care off. Afghanistan's median age in 2017 was 16 years, making it the only country outside of Africa with a median age below 17. A 2019 study by the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies showed that Israel's fertility rate was 3.1 per woman, well above all other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). For comparison, Mexico was in second place at 2.2. Israel therefore had nothing short of a baby boom, comparable to what the United States experienced after World War II. Although ultra-Orthodox women in Israel had a phenomenal birth rate of about seven, Israel's comparatively high rate is not due to highly religious women alone but rather the national culture and attitude towards having a family. Secular Israeli women had a fertility rate of about 2.2, also high by the standards of the OECD. However, among Arabs living in Israel, family size has declined significantly since the 1960s to a level less than that of their Jewish counterparts and comparable with the developed world, where women have become more active in the work place. Among Israeli women in general, women's participation in the labor force has increased, as is the case with other developed countries, yet their fertility has not declined, unlike said countries.  Europe  In 2018, 19.70% of the population the European Union as a whole was at least 65 years old. The median age of all 28 members of the bloc, including the United Kingdom which recently decided to leave, was 43 years in 2019. It was about 29 in the 1950s, when there were just six members: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Like all other inhabited continents, Europe saw significant population growth in the late twentieth century. However, Europe's growth is projected to halt by the early 2020s due to falling fertility rates and an aging population. In 2015, a woman living in the European Union had on average 1.5 children, down from 2.6 in 1960. Although the E.U. continues to experience a net influx of immigrants, this is not enough to balance out the low fertility rates. In 2017, the median age was 53.1 years in Monaco, 45 in Germany and Italy, 43 in Greece, Bulgaria, and Portugal, making them some of the oldest countries in the world besides Japan and Bermuda. They are followed by Austria, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Spain, whose median age was 43. Population pyramid of Italy in 2018 Italy's fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the Great Recession of 2007‚Äì8, with the youth unemployment rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad ‚Äì 150,000 did in 2018 ‚Äì and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. The Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) reported that the number of babies born in 2018 in Italy was the lowest since the unification of Italy in 1861. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them. Only Japan has an age structure more tilted towards the elderly. In 2018, 23% of the Italian population was above the age of 65, compared to 27% for Japan. One possible solution to this problem is incentivizing reproduction, as France has done, by investing in longer parental leaves, daycare, and tax exemptions for parents. As of 2019, France has approximately the same population as Italy but 65% more births. In 2015, Italy introduced a cash handout of ‚Ç¨800 per couple per child. This does not seem to have had an impact in the long run. People may choose to have a child earlier, but ultimately, this does not increase the nation's fertility rate. This pattern has also been observed in other countries, family study expert Anne Gauthier of the University of Groningen told the BBC. In Italy's case, the subsidy does not address economic concerns or social attitudes. Another solution is immigration, which has been alleviating the decline, but it does not come without political backlash. Population pyramid of Greece in 2018 Greece's serious demographic problem comes as a result of economic hardship which has prompted many young people are leaving the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere. Between 2009 and 2018, about half a million people left the country, many of them of child-bearing age. In 2010, 115,000 children were born; that number dropped to 92,000 in 2015, and then to below 89,000 in 2017, the lowest on record. In 2019, the fertility rate fell to just 1.3 per woman, well below the replacement level and one of the lowest in Europe. Some of the more remote regions of Greece suffer from shortages of obstetricians and gynecologists, many of whom have gone abroad, which deters would-be parents. And there are primary school students who are the only child of their village and whose parents are in their 40s. In general, the Greeks are having children later and having fewer children in the 2010s compared to the 1980s. This brain drain and a rapidly aging population could spell disaster for the country. The Spanish National Institute of Statistics reported that the number of babies born in Spain in 2018 was the lowest since 1998 and a 40.7% drop compared to 2008. This is due to the fact that there were fewer women of childbearing age in Spain than in the past, and that modern Spaniards are having fewer children. In Portugal, the fertility rate dropped to 1.3 in the late 2010s. Across Southern Europe, about 20% of women born in the 1970s are childless, a number not seen since the First World War. More and more schools have been forced to close and many towns are becoming empty. Southern Europe could become countries of old people by the late 2030s (when people born in the early 2010s and mid-2020s come of age) if the current trend continues. Hungary's birth rate was about 1.48 in 2018. For the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, which favors \\"procreation over immigration,\\" raising the national fertility rate is a matter of \\"strategic importance.\\" In December 2018, the Hungarian government nationalized six fertility clinics and said it would offer free in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment starting February 2020, though the details of who would be eligible for this program remain unclear. Like other Eastern European countries, Hungary faces a declining population not just due to its low birth rate, now half of what it was in 1950, but also to emigration to Western Europe. About one in every seven Hungarian children was born outside Hungary in the 2010s. Population pyramid of Russia in 2018 The United Nations Population Division projected that Russia, which had a birth rate of 1.75 in 2018, would find its population drop from 143 million down to 132 million by 2050. Russia's population has been on the decline since the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Another reason for Russia's demographic decline is the nation's low life expectancy for men, at only 64 years in 2015, or 15 years less than that in Italy, Germany, or Sweden. This is due to a combination of unusually high rates of alcoholism, smoking, untreated cancer, tuberculosis, suicides, violence, and HIV/AIDS. Although previous attempts to raise the birth rate have failed, in 2018, President Vladimir Putin proposed giving money to low-income families, first-time mothers, families with many children, and the creation of more nurseries. This is part of a massive spending package aimed at revitalizing the struggling Russian economy. Throughout the 2000s, France maintained a fertility rate of about 2.0, but from the early 2010s onward, the country has seen its fertility rate falling gradually. Despite recent declines, France retains one of the highest birth rates in Europe at 1.92 in 2017, according to the World Bank. While many countries have introduced policies intended to incentivize people to have more children, these might be counter-balanced by other policies, such as taxes. In France, the Ministry of Families is solely responsible for family and child benefits packages, which are more generous for larger families. Germany's fertility rate rose from 1.33 in 2006 to 1.57 in 2017, moving the country away from Spain and Italy and closer to the E.U. average. This is due to a few reasons. Older women were having children, which caused the rate to increase slightly. New immigrants, who arrived in Germany in great numbers in that decade, tend to have more children than natives, though their children will likely assimilate into German society and will have smaller families of their own than their parents and grandparents. In West Germany, working mothers were once stigmatized, but this is no longer the case in unified Germany. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the German federal government introduced more generous parental leave, encouraged fathers to take (more) time off, and increased the number of nurseries, to which the government declared children over one year old were entitled to. Although the supply of nurseries remained insufficient, the number of children enrolled in them rose from 286,000 in 2006 to 762,000 in 2017. Population pyramid of Sweden in 2018 In Sweden, generous pro-natalist policies contribute to the nation having a birth rate of 1.9 in 2017, which was high compared to the rest of Europe. Swedish parents are entitled to 480 days of parental leave to share between both parents, with fathers claiming on average 30% of the amount. According to the European Commission, Sweden has one of the lowest child poverty rates in the E.U. Nevertheless, Sweden's birth rate has begun to fall in the late 2010s. One of the reasons why Sweden has maintained a relatively high birth rate is because the country has for decades been accepting immigrants, who tend to have more children than the average Swede. But immigration has proven to be a contentious issue. While some see it as a lifeline, others view it as a threat. Other Nordic countries face the same situation. Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Iceland all saw their fertility rates decline in the late 2010s to between 1.49 and 1.71 from previously near replacement level, although their economies had already recovered from the Great Recession by that time. \\"The number of childless individuals is growing rapidly, and the number of women having three or more children is going down. This kind of fall is unheard of in modern times in Finland,\\" family sociologist Anna Rotkirch told AFP. According to Statistics Finland, the total fertility rate of that country in 2019 was 1.35, the lowest on record. Causes for this decline include financial uncertainty, urbanization, rising unemployment, declining median income, and high cost of living. Falling fertility rates jeopardize the much prized Nordic welfare systems. Generous parental benefits, including subsidized childcare, have proven ineffective in halting the demographic decline. According to a 2020 report from Nordic Council of Ministers, the Finns were aging at a faster rate than any of their counterparts in the Nordic region. Statistics Finland predicted in 2019 that given current trends in fertility and migration, Finland's population would begin to decline by 2031. Population pyramid of the Faroe Islands in 2018 According to the World Bank, the Faroe Islands had a birth rate of about 2.5 in 2018, one of the highest in Europe, a position they have maintained for decades. Like the rest of the Nordic region, the territory has implemented a variety of family-friendly policies, such as 46 weeks of parental leave, numerous and cheap kindergartens, and tax cuts, including one for seven-seat vehicles. But unlike the rest of the Nordic region, traditional family values and family ties remain strong. Sociologist Hans Pauli Str√∏m of Statistics Faroe Islands told the AFP, \\"In our culture, we perceive a person more as a member of a family than as an independent individual. This close and intimate contact between generations makes it easier to have children.\\" In addition, women's workforce participation is comparatively high, at 82%, compared to an average of 59% for the European Union, of which the Islands are not a member. More than half of Faroese women work part-time as a matter of personal choice rather than labor- market conditions. The autonomous Danish territory in the North Atlantic, in fact, had a prosperous economy, as of the 2010s. In 2018‚Äì19, the Republic of Ireland had the highest birth rate and the lowest death rate in the European Union, according to Eurostat. Although Ireland had a thriving economy in the mid- to late-2010s, only 61,016 babies were born here in 2018 down from 75,554 in 2009. Ireland's birth rate fell from 16.8 in 2008 to 12.6 in 2018, a drop of about a quarter. The average age of first-time mothers in Ireland was 32.9 in 2018, up by over two years compared to the mid-2000s. Between 2006 and 2016, the number of babies born to women in their 40s doubled while that to teenagers fell by 52.8%. Economist Edgar Morgenroth of Dublin City University told the Irish Times that one of the reasons behind Ireland's falling fertility rate was the fact that Ireland had a baby burst in the 1980s after a baby boom in the 1970s, and the people born in the 1980s were starting families in the 2010s. He further explained that high housing and childcare costs could be behind Irish couples' reluctance. The marriage rate was 4.3 per 1,000 in 2018, the lowest since 1997 even though same-sex marriages were included. In addition, people were getting married later. In 2018, the average age at first marriage for a man was 36.4, up from 33.6 in 2008; for a women, those figures were 34.4 and 31.7, respectively. Usually, rising birth and marriage rates correspond to a healthy economy, but the present statistics seem to have buckled that trend. As of 2016, Ireland was, demographically, a young country by European standards. However, the country is aging quite quickly. According to the Central Statistics Office, although Ireland had more people below the age of 14 than above the age of 65 in 2016, the situation could flip by 2031 in all projected scenarios, which will pose a problem for public policy. For instance, Ireland's healthcare system, already operating on a tight budget, will be under even more pressure. Population pyramid of the United Kingdom in 2018 According to the United Kingdom Office for National Statistics, the fertility rates of England and Wales fell to a record low in 2018. Moreover, they fell for women of all age groups except those in their 40s. A grand total of 657,076 children were born in England and Wales in 2018, down 10% from 2012. There were 11.1 births per thousand people in 2018, compared to a peak of 20.5 in 1947, and the total fertility rate was 1.70, down from 1.76 in 2017. In fact, their fertility rates have been consistently below replacement since the late 1970s. At the same time, the number of stillbirths ‚Äì when a baby is born after at least 24 weeks of pregnancy but with no signs of life ‚Äì plummeted to a record low for the second consecutive year, standing at 4.1 per a thousand births in 2018. England said it was committed to pushing that number down to 2.6 by 2025. Falling fertility rates in England and Wales have been part of a continuing trend since the late twentieth century, with 1977 and 1992-2002 the only years where these jurisdictions had lower fertility rates on record. As has been the case since the start of the new millennium, the birth rate of women below the age of 20 continues to fall, down to 11.9 in 2018. Before 2004, women in their mid- to late-20s had the highest fertility rate, but between the mid-2000s and the late-2010s, those in their early- to mid-30s held that position. Social statistician and demographer Ann Berrington of the University of Southampton told The Guardian that access to education, \\"changing aspirations\\" in life, the availability of emergency and long-acting contraception, and the lack of affordable housing were among the reasons behind the decline in fertility among people in their 20s and 30s. If women were merely delaying childbirth, the fertility of women in their 20s would decline while that of women in their 30s would rise. But this was not the case in the late 2010s. Women in their 40s saw a slight increase, but they accounted for only 5% of all births in the same period. Immigrants have contributed to this decline. Whereas previously they tended to have more children on average than native Britons and were indeed above replacement level, their fertility rate in England and Wales dropped from 2.46 in 2004 to 1.97 in 2020. In other words, the proportions of births to immigrant women have fallen and are now below replacement. The fertility gap is closing. Meanwhile, in Scotland, the fertility rate continues its downward trend since 2008. Figures from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) reveal that 12,580 births were registered in the final quarter of 2018. Except for 2002, this is the lowest since record-keeping began in 1855. NRS explained that economic insecurity and the postponement of motherhood, which often means having fewer children, are among the reasons why. In the late 2010s, 46% of U.K. couples had only one child.  North America  Population pyramid of Canada in 2018 In Canada, about one in five Millennials were delaying having children because of financial worries. Canada's average non-mortgage debt was CAN$20,000 in 2018. One in three Millennials felt \\"overwhelmed\\" by their liabilities, compared to 26% of Generation X and 13% of Baby Boomers, according to consultant firm BDO Canada. More than one in three Canadians with children felt stressed out by debt, compared with one-fifth of those without children. Many Canadian couples in their 20s and 30s are also struggling with their student loan debts. Research by the Royal Bank of Canada suggests that Canadian Millennials have been flocking to the large cities in spite of their expensive costs of living between the mid- and late 2010s in search of economic opportunities and cultural amenities. Data from Statistics Canada reveals that between 2000 and 2017, the birth rate among women under 30 years old fell in all provinces and territories except New Brunswick women between the ages of 25 and 29 whereas that of women of age 30 and over rose everywhere except in Nunavut among women aged 35 to 39. Meanwhile, the adolescent fertility rate (15 to 19) halved in most of Canada, a result likely due to improved sex education. The comparatively low birth rate of women in their 20s living in British Columbia and Ontario was correlated with the high housing costs in these provinces. On the other hand, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut had relatively high fertility rates because they have large Indigenous populations, and Indigenous women tend to have more children. (Data for Yukon was not available.) Statistics Canada reported in 2015 that for the first time in Canadian history, there were more people aged 65 and over than people below the age of 15. One in six Canadians were above the age of 65 in July 2015. If this trend continues, there would be three seniors for every two children below the age of 15 in 20 years. During the early 2010s, among the various religious groups in Canada, Muslims had the highest fertility rate of all. At 2.4 per woman, they outpaced Hindus (2.0) Sikhs (1.9), Jews (1.8), Christians (1.6), and secular people (1.4). Nationwide, 38.6% of Canadian couples had only one child during the late 2010s. Population pyramid of the United States in 2018 As their economic prospects improve, most American Millennials say they desire marriage, children, and home ownership. While Millennials were initially responsible for the so-called \\"back-to-the-city\\" trend, by the late 2010s, Millennial homeowners were more likely to be in the suburbs than the cities. Besides the cost of living, including housing costs, people are leaving the big cities in search of warmer climates, lower taxes, better economic opportunities, and better school districts for their children. Exurbs have become quite popular among Millennials as well. The return of suburbanization in the United States is due to not just Millennials reaching a stage in their lives where they start to have children but also to the new economics of space made possible by fast telecommunications technology and e-commerce, effectively cutting perceived distances. According to the Pew Research Center, by 2016, the cumulative number of American women of the millennial generation who had given birth at least once reached 17.3 million. About 1.2 million Millennial women had their first child that year. By the mid-2010s, Millennials, who made up 29% of the adult population and 35% of the workforce of the U.S., were responsible for a majority of births in the nation. In 2016, 48% of Millennial women were mothers, compared to 57% of Generation-X women in 2000 when they were the same age. The increasing age of women when they become mothers for the first time is a trend that can be traced back to the 1970s, if not earlier.More broadly, contemporary human females are evolving to reach menarche earlier and menopause later compared to their ancestral counterparts. See human evolution in the Holocene epoch. Factors behind this trend include a declining interest in marriage, the growth in educational attainment, and the rise of women's participation in the workforce. Single-child families were the fastest-growing type of family units in the U.S. during the late 2010s. A report from the Brookings Institution stated that in the United States, the Millennials are a bridge between the largely Caucasian pre-Millennials (Generation X and their predecessors) and the more diverse post-Millennials (Generation Z and their successors). Overall, the number of births to Caucasian women in the United States dropped 7% between 2000 and 2018. Among foreign-born Caucasian women, however, the number of births increased by 1% in the same period. Although the number of births to foreign-born Hispanic women fell from 58% in 2000 to 50% in 2018, the share of births due to U.S.-born Hispanic women increased from 20% in 2000 to 24% in 2018. The number of births to foreign-born Asian women rose from 19% in 2000 to 24% in 2018 while that due to U.S.-born Asian women went from 1% in 2000 to 2% in 2018. In all, between 2000 and 2017, more births were to foreign-born than U.S.-born women. By analyzing data from the Census Bureau, the Pew Research Center discovered that in 2017, at least 20% of kindergartners in public schools were Hispanics in a grand total of 18 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia, compared to only eight states in 2000 and 17 in 2010. Between 2010 and 2017, Massachusetts and Nebraska joined the list while Idaho left. This reflects the falling pace of population growth of Hispanics in the United States, due to declining fertility and immigration rates. Hispanics, who comprised 18% of the U.S. population (or about 60 million people) have been spreading across the United States since the 1980s and are now the largest minority ethnic group in the nation. They also made up 28% of the students in K-12 public schools in 2019, up from 14% in 1995. For comparison, the number of Asian public-school students increased slightly, from 4% to 6% during the same period. Blacks fell slightly from 17% to 15%, and whites dropped from 65% to 47%. Overall, the number of children born to ethnic minorities has exceeded 50% of the total since 2015. Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveal that U.S. fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of 2.1 since 1971. In 2017, it dropped to 1.765, the lowest in three decades. 15.4% of the U.S. population was over 65 years of age in 2018. After the Second World War, the U.S. fertility rate peaked in 1958 at 3.77 births per woman, fell to 1.84 in 1980, and climbed to 2.08 in 1990 before declining again in 2007. However, there is great variation in terms of geography, age groups, and ethnicity. South Dakota had the highest birth rate at 2,228 per a thousand women and the District of Columbia the lowest at 1,421. Besides South Dakota, only Utah (2,121) had a birth rate above replacement level. From 2006 to 2016, women whose ages range from the mid-20s to the mid-30s maintained the highest birth rates of all while those in their late 30s and early 40s saw significant increases in birth rates. American women are having children later in life, with the average age at first birth rising to 26.4 in the late 2010s, up from 23 in the mid-1990s. Falling teenage birth rates play a role in this development. In fact, the number of births given by teenagers, which reached ominous levels in the 1990s, have plummeted by about 60% between 2006 and 2016. This is thanks in no small part to the collapse of birth rates among black and Hispanic teens, down 50% from 2006. Overall, births fell for Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and whites but remained stable for native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. While Hispanic American women still maintained the highest fertility rate of any racial or ethnic groups in the United States, their birth rate dropped 31% between 2007 and 2017. Like their American peers and unlike their immigrant parents and grandparents, young Hispanic American women in the 2010s were more focused on their education and careers and less interested in having children. That U.S. fertility rates continue to drop is anomalous to demographers because fertility rates typically track the nation's economic health. It was no surprise that U.S. fertility rates dropped during the Great Recession of 2007‚Äì8. But the U.S. economy has shown strong signs of recovery for some time, and birthrates continue to fall. In general, however, American women still tend to have children earlier than their counterparts from other developed countries and the U.S. total fertility rate remains comparatively high for a rich country. In fact, compared with their counterparts from other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), first- time American mothers were among the youngest on average, on par with Latvian women (26.5 years) during the 2010s. At the other extreme end were women from Italy (30.8), and South Korea (31.4). During the same period, American women ended their childbearing years with more children on average (2.2) than most other developed countries, with the notable exception of Icelandic women (2.3). At the other end were women from Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan (all 1.5). Below-replacement-level fertility rates could lead to labor shortages in the future. Speaking to the Associated Press, family specialist Karen Benjamin Guzzo from Bowling Green State University in Ohio recommended childcare subsidies, preschool expansion, (paid) parental leave, housing assistance, and student debt reduction or forgiveness. In any case, while the United States is indeed an aging society, its demographic decline is not as serious as that faced by many other major economies. The number of Americans of working age is predicted to increase by 10% between 2019 and 2040. In 2019, the fertility rate of Mexico was about 2.2, higher than that of any other member of the OECD except Israel at 3.1.  Oceania  Population pyramid of Australia in 2018 Australia's total fertility rate has fallen from above three in the post-war era, to about replacement level (2.1) in the 1970s to below that in the late 2010s. It stood at 1.74 in 2017. However, immigration has been offsetting the effects of a declining birthrate. In the 2010s, among the residents of Australia, 5% were born in the United Kingdom, 2.5% from China, 2.2% from India, and 1.1% from the Philippines. 84% of new arrivals in the fiscal year of 2016 were below 40 years of age, compared to 54% of those already in the country. Like other immigrant-friendly countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Australia's working-age population is expected to grow till about 2025. However, the ratio of people of working age to dependents and retirees (the dependency ratio) has gone from eight in the 1970s to about four in the 2010s. It could drop to two by the 2060s, depending in immigration levels. \\"The older the population is, the more people are on welfare benefits, we need more health care, and there's a smaller base to pay the taxes,\\" Ian Harper of the Melbourne Business School told ABC News (Australia). While the government has scaled back plans to increase the retirement age, to cut pensions, and to raise taxes due to public opposition, demographic pressures continue to mount as the buffering effects of immigration are fading away. Australians coming of age in the early twenty- first century are more reluctant to have children compared to their predecessors due to economic reasons: higher student debt, expensive housing, and negative income growth. Statistics New Zealand reported that the nation's fertility rate in 2017 was 1.81, the lowest on record. Although the total number of births went up, the birth rate went down because of country's larger population thanks to high levels of immigration. New Zealand's fertility rate remained more or less stable between the late 1970s and the late 2010s. Younger women were driving the birth rate down, with those between the ages of 15 and 29 having the lowest birth rates on record. In 2017, New Zealand teenagers had one half the number of babies of 2008, and under a quarter of 1972. Meanwhile, women above the age of 30 were having more children. Between the late 2000s and late 2010s, an average of 60,308 babies were born in New Zealand.  South America  Brazil's fertility rate has fallen from 6.3 in 1960 to 1.7 in 2020. For this reason, the nation's population is projected to decline by the end of the twenty-first century. According to a 2012 study, soap operas featuring small families have contributed to the growing acceptance of having just a few children in a predominantly Catholic country. However, Brazil continues to have relatively high rates of adolescent pregnancies, and the government is working to address this problem.  Education   Asia  In order to boost the nation's birthrate, in 2019, the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe introduced a number of education reforms. Starting in October 2019, preschool education will be free for all children between the ages of three and five. Childcare will be free for children under the age of two from low-income households. These programs will be funded by a consumption tax hike, from eight to ten percent. Starting April 2020, entrance and tuition fees for public as well as private universities will be waived or reduced. Students from low-income and tax- exempt families will be eligible for financial assistance to help them cover textbook, transportation, and living expenses. The whole program is projected to cost ¬•776 billion (US$7.1 billion) per annum. In 2020, the government of Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Ph√∫c recommended a series of education reforms in order to raise the fertility rates of localities that found themselves below the replacement level. In particular, the construction of daycare facilities and kindergartens in urban and industrial zones, housing subsidies for couples with two children in sub-replacement areas, and priority admission for children of said couples in public schools.  Europe  In France, while year-long mandatory military service for men was abolished in 1996 by President Jacques Chirac, who wanted to build a professional all- volunteer military, all citizens between 17 and 25 years of age must still participate in the Defense and Citizenship Day, when they are introduced to the French Armed Forces, and take language tests. In 2019, President Emmanuel Macron introduced something similar to mandatory military service, but for teenagers, as promised during his presidential campaign. Known as the Service National Universel or SNU, it is a compulsory civic service. While students will not have to shave their heads or handle military equipment, they will have to sleep in tents, get up early (at 6:30 am), participate in various physical activities, raise the tricolor, and sing the national anthem. They will have to wear a uniform, though it is more akin to the outfit of security guards rather than military personnel. This program takes a total of four weeks. In the first two, youths learn how to provide first aid, how to navigate with a map, how to recognize fake news, emergency responses for various scenarios, and self-defense. In addition, they get health checks and get tested on their mastery of the French language, and they participate in debates on a variety of social issues, including environmentalism, state secularism, and gender equality. In the second fortnight, they volunteer with a charity for local government. The aim of this program is to promote national cohesion and patriotism, at a time of deep division on religious and political grounds, to get people out of their neighborhoods and regions, and mix people of different socioeconomic classes, something mandatory military service used to do. Supporters thought that teenagers rarely raise the national flag, spend too much time on their phones, and felt nostalgic for the era of compulsory military service, considered a rite of passage for young men and a tool of character-building. Critics argued that this program is inadequate, and would cost too much. The SNU is projected to affect some 800,000 French citizens each year when it becomes mandatory for all aged 16 to 21 by 2026, at a cost of some ‚Ç¨1.6 billion. Another major concern is that it will overburden the French military, already stretched thin by counter-terrorism campaigns at home and abroad. A 2015 IFOP poll revealed that 80% of the French people supported some kind of mandatory service, military, or civilian. At the same time, returning to conscription was also popular; supporters included 90% of the UMP party, 89% of the National Front (now the National Rally), 71% of the Socialist Party, and 67% of people aged 18 to 24. This poll was conducted after the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.  North America  The American Academy of Pediatricians recommended that parents allow their children more time to play. In 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a policy statement summarizing progress on developmental and neurological research on unstructured time spent by children, colloquially 'play', and noting the importance of playtime for social, cognitive, and language skills development. This is because to many educators and parents, play has come to be seen as outdated and irrelevant. In fact, between 1981 and 1997, time spent by children on unstructured activities dropped by 25% due to increased amounts of time spent on structured activities. Unstructured time tended to be spent on screens at the expense of active play. The statement encourages parents and children to spend more time on \\"playful learning,\\" which reinforces the intrinsic motivation to learn and discover and strengthens the bond between children and their parents and other caregivers. It also helps children handle stress and prevents \\"toxic stress,\\" something that hampers development. Dr. Michael Yogman, the lead author of the statement, noted that play does not necessarily have to involve fancy toys; common household items would do as well. Moreover, parents reading to children also counts as play, because it encourages children to use their imaginations. In 2019, psychiatrists from Quebec launched a campaign urging for the creation of courses on mental health for primary schoolchildren in order to teach them how to handle a personal or social crisis, and to deal with the psychological impact of the digital world. According to the Association des m√©decins psychiatres du Qu√©bec (AMPQ), this campaign focuses on children born after 2010, that is, Generation Alpha. In addition to the AMPQ, this movement is backed by the F√©d√©ration des m√©decins sp√©cialistes du Qu√©bec (FMSQ), the Quebec Pediatric Association (APQ), the Association des sp√©cialistes en m√©decine pr√©ventive du Qu√©bec (ASMPQ) and the Fondation Jeunes en T√™te. Although the Common Core standards, an education initiative in the United States, eliminated the requirement that public elementary schools teach cursive writing in 2010, lawmakers from many states, including Illinois, Ohio, and Texas, have introduced legislation to teach it in theirs in 2019. Some studies point to the benefits of handwriting ‚Äì print or cursive ‚Äì for the development of cognitive and motor skills as well as memory and comprehension. For example, one 2012 neuroscience study suggests that handwriting \\"may facilitate reading acquisition in young children.\\" Cursive writing has been used to help students with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, a disorder that makes it difficult to interpret words, letters, and other symbols. Unfortunately, lawmakers often cite them out of context, conflating handwriting in general with cursive handwriting. In any case, some 80% of historical records and documents of the United States, such as the correspondence of Abraham Lincoln, was written by hand in cursive, and students today tend to be unable to read them. Historically, cursive writing was regarded as a mandatory, almost military, exercise. But today, it is thought of as an art form by those who pursue it, both adults and children. In 2013, less than a third of American public schools had access to broadband Internet service, according to the non-profit EducationSuperHighway. By 2019, however, that number reached 99%. This has increased the frequency of digital learning. Since the early 2010s, a number of U.S. states have taken steps to strengthen teacher education. Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas had the top programs in 2014. Meanwhile, Rhode Island, which previously had the nation's lowest bar on who can train to become a school teacher, has been admitting education students with higher and higher average SAT, ACT, and GRE scores. The state aims to accept only those with standardized test scores in the top third of the national distribution by 2020, which would put it in the ranks of education superpowers such as Finland and Singapore. In Finland, studying to become a teacher is as tough and prestigious as studying to become a medical doctor or a lawyer.  Health and welfare  Allergies While food allergies have been observed by doctors since ancient times and virtually all foods can be allergens, research by the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota found they are becoming increasingly common since the early 2000s. By the late 2010s, one in twelve American children has a food allergy, with peanut allergy being the most prevalent type. Reasons for this remain poorly understood. Nut allergies in general have quadrupled and shellfish allergies have increased 40% between 2004 and 2019. In all, about 36% of American children have some kind of allergy. By comparison, this number among the Amish in Indiana is 7%. Allergies have also risen ominously in other Western countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, the number of children hospitalized for allergic reactions increased by a factor of five between 1990 and the late 2010s, as did the number of British children allergic to peanuts. In general, the better developed the country, the higher the rates of allergies. Reasons for this also remain poorly understood. One possible explanation, supported by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is that parents keep their children \\"too clean for their own good.\\" They recommend exposing newborn babies to a variety of potentially allergenic foods, such as peanut butter, before they reach the age of six months. According to this \\"hygiene hypothesis,\\" such exposures give the infant's immune system some exercise, making it less likely to overreact. Evidence for this includes the fact that children living on a farm are consistently less likely to be allergic than their counterparts who are raised in the city, and that children born in a developed country to parents who immigrated from developing nations are more likely to be allergic than their parents are.  Communicable diseases and vaccinations  Little girl in a medical mask during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the crisis people around the world were expected to wear facial masks in many settings (often including children from an early age). In the United States, public health officials were raising the alarm in the 2010s when vaccination rates dropped. Many parents thought, mistakenly, that they did not need to vaccinate their children against diseases such as polio and measles because they had become either extremely rare or eradicated. Infectious diseases could return if not enough people got inoculated. In the wake of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that mass vaccination campaigns be suspended in order to ensure social distancing. Dozens of countries followed this advice. But some public health experts warned that the suspension of these programs can come with serious consequences, especially in poor countries with weak healthcare systems. For children from these places, such campaigns are the only way for them to get vaccinated against various communicable diseases such as polio, measles, cholera, human papillomavirus, and meningitis. Case numbers could surge afterwards. Moreover, because of the lockdown measures, namely, the restriction of international travels and transport, some countries might find themselves running short on not just medical equipment but also vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 can inflict more damage than the people it infects and kills. Africa was declared free of wild poliovirus in August 2020. At present, the virus is only detected in Pakistan and Afghanistan thanks to superstitions, misinformation, conspiracy theories, and direct action by the Taliban to prevent children from being vaccinated. Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic allowed cases to surge in these two countries. Much of Generation Alpha are living through the 2019-20 coronavirus global pandemic as young children. Although they are at far less risk of becoming seriously ill with the disease than their elders this cohort is dramatically affected by the crisis in other ways. Many are faced with extended periods out of school or daycare and much more time at home, which raised concerns about potential harm to the development of small children and the academic attainment of those at school age while putting some, especially the particularly vulnerable, at greater risk of abuse. The crises also led to increased child malnourishment and increased mortality, especially in poorer countries. Obesity and malnutrition A report by the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) released October 2019 stated that some 700 million children under the age of five worldwide are either obese or undernourished. Although there was a 40% drop in malnourishment in developing countries between 1990 and 2015, some 149 million toddlers are too short for their age, which hampers body and brain development. UNICEF's nutrition program chief Victor Aguayo said, \\"A mother who is overweight or obese can have children who are stunted or wasted.\\" About one in two youngsters suffer from deficiencies of vitamins and minerals. Only two-fifths of infants are exclusively breastfed, as recommended by pediatricians and nutritionists, while the sale of formula milk jumped 40% globally. In middle-income countries such as Brazil, China, and Turkey, that number is 75%. Even though obesity was virtually non-existent in poor countries three decades ago, today, at least ten percent of children in them suffer from this condition. The report recommends taxes on sugary drinks and beverages and enhanced regulatory oversight of breast milk substitutes and fast foods. Problems arising from screen time Growing numbers of children now suffer from eye problems. A 2015 study found that the frequency of nearsightedness has doubled in the United Kingdom within the last 50 years. Ophthalmologist Steve Schallhorn, chairman of the Optical Express International Medical Advisory Board, noted that researchers have pointed to a link between the regular use of handheld electronic devices and eyestrain. The American Optometric Association sounded the alarm on a similar vein. According to a spokeswoman, digital eyestrain, or computer vision syndrome, is \\"rampant, especially as we move toward smaller devices and the prominence of devices increase in our everyday lives.\\" Symptoms include dry and irritated eyes, fatigue, eye strain, blurry vision, difficulty focusing, headaches. However, the syndrome does not cause vision loss or any other permanent damage. In order to alleviate or prevent eyestrain, the Vision Council recommends that people limit screen time, take frequent breaks, adjust the screen brightness, change the background from bright colors to gray, increase text sizes, and blinking more often. The Council advises parents to limit their children's screen time as well as lead by example by reducing their own screen time in front of children. In 2019, the WHO issued recommendations on the amount young children should spend in front of a screen every day. WHO said toddlers under the age of five should spend no more than an hour watching a screen and infants under the age of one should not be watching at all. Its guidelines are similar to those introduced by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which recommended that children under 19 months old should not spend time watching anything other than video chats. Moreover, it said children under two years old should only watch \\"high-quality programming\\" under parental supervision. However, Andrew Przybylski, who directs research at the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford, told the Associated Press that \\"Not all screen time is created equal\\" and that screen time advice needs to take into account \\"the content and context of use.\\" In addition, the United Kingdom's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said its available data was not strong enough to indicate the necessity of screen time limits. WHO said its recommendations were intended to address the problem of sedentary behavior leading to health issues such as obesity. A 2019 study published in the JAMA Pediatrics investigated how screen time affected the brain structure of children aged three to five (preschoolers) using MRI scans. The test subjects‚Äî27 girls and 20 boys‚Äîtook cognitive tests before their brain scans while their parents answered a questionnaire on screen time developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The researchers found that the toddlers who spent more than an hour per day in front of a screen without parental involvement showed less development in the brain's white matter, the region responsible for cognitive and linguistic skills. Lead author Dr. John Hutton, a pediatrician and clinical researcher at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, told CNN that this finding was significant because the brain develops most rapidly during the first five years of a person's life. Previous studies revealed that excessive screen time is linked to sleep deprivation, impaired language development, behavioral problems, difficulty paying attention and thinking clearly, poor eating habits, and damaged executive functions.  Use of electronic communications technology  Many members of Generation Alpha have grown up using smartphones and tablets as part of their childhood entertainment. Screen time among infants, toddlers, and preschoolers exploded during the 2010s. Some 90% of young children used a handheld electronic device by the age of one; in some cases, children started using them when they were only a few months old. Some of their parents used electronic gadgets and pacifiers simultaneously. Others even use portable digital devices as pacifiers. In addition, electronic devices are also used as educational aids. As a matter of fact, their parents, the Millennials, are heavy social media users. A 2014 report from cybersecurity firm AVG stated that 6% of parents created a social media account and 8% an email account for their baby or toddler. According to BabyCenter, an online company specializing in pregnancy, childbirth, and child-rearing, 79% of Millennial mothers used social media on a daily basis and 63% used their smartphones more frequently since becoming pregnant or giving birth. More specifically, 24% logged on to Facebook more frequently and 33% did the same to Instagram after becoming a mother. Non- profit advocacy group Common Sense Media warned that parents should take better care of their online privacy, lest their and their children's personal information and photographs fall into the wrong hands. This warning was issued after a Utah mother reportedly found a photograph of her children on a social media post with pornographic hashtags in May 2015. Being born into an environment where the use of electronic devices is ubiquitous comes with its own challenges: cyber-bullying, screen addiction, and inappropriate contents. Nevertheless, because the Millennials are themselves no stranger to this environment, they can use their personal experience to help their children navigate it.  Predictions  The first wave of Generation Alpha will reach adulthood by the 2030s. By that time, the human population is expected to be just under nine billion, and the world will have the highest proportion of people over 60 years of age in history, meaning this demographic cohort will bear the burden of an aging population. According to Mark McCrindle, a social researcher from Australia, Generation Alpha will most likely delay standard life markers such as marriage, childbirth, and retirements, as did the few previous generations. McCrindle estimated that Generation Alpha will make up 11% of the global workforce by 2030. He also predicted that they will live longer and have smaller families, and will be \\"the most formally educated generation ever, the most technology-supplied generation ever, and globally the wealthiest generation ever.\\" The United Nations forecasted that while the global average life expectancy would rise from 70 in 2015 to 83 in 2100, the ratio of people of working age to senior citizens would shrink due to falling fertility rates worldwide. By 2050, many nations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America would have fewer than two workers per retiree. U.N. figures show that, leaving out migration, all of Europe, Japan, and the United States were shrinking in the 2010s, but by 2050, 48 countries and territories would experience a population decline. As of 2020, the latest demographic projections from the United Nations predict that there would be 8.5 billion people by 2030, 9.7 billion by 2050, and 10.9 billion by 2100. U.N. calculations assume countries with especially low fertility rates will see them rise to an average of 1.8 per woman. However, a 2020 study by researchers from Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), University of Washington, published in the Lancet projected there would only be about 8.8 billion people by 2100, two billion fewer than what the U.N. predicted. This was because their analysis suggested that as educational opportunities and family planning services become more and more accessible for women, they would choose to have no more than 1.5 children on average. A majority of the world's countries would continue to see their fertility rates decline, the researchers claimed. In particular, over 20 countries‚Äîincluding China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Poland‚Äîwould find their populations reduced by around half or more. Meanwhile, sub-Saharan Africa would continue to experience a population boom, with Nigeria reaching 800 million people by century's end. Lower-than-expected human population growth means less stress on the environment and on food supplies, but it also points to a bleak economic picture for the greying countries. For the sub-Saharan African countries, though, there would be considerable opportunity for growth. The researchers predicted that as the century unfolds, major but aging economies such as Brazil, Russia, Italy, and Spain would shrink while Japan, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom would remain within the top ten. India would eventually claim the third spot. China would displace the United States as the largest economy in the world by mid-century, but would return to second place later on. Writing in 2009, demographer Phillip Longman predicted that falling fertility rates around the world, among developed and even some developing countries, and the resultant demographic changes will play a role in the ongoing cultural evolution. Governments have not and will not be able to dramatically increase fertility rates; they succeed only in helping people have children earlier. In many current countries, various cultural and economic realities discourage procreation. Longman observed that in the past there have been cases of jurisdictions finding their fertility rates to be too low, yet humanity has obviously not gone extinct. The kingdoms and empires of old and the people who forged them are no more, but those places remain populated‚Äîjust with different people. When certain groups of people have no children or too few, they will gradually be replaced by those who have more children. People who live in fast-moving and cosmopolitan societies typically find their connections to their ancestors fade and are thus less likely to have children whereas those who will eventually outnumber them tend to be religious, to hold traditional views, and to identify strongly with their own people and country. Longman contended that already by the early 2000s it had become apparent that the mainstream culture of the United States was gradually shifting away from secular individualism and towards religious fundamentalism while Europeans were slowly distancing themselves from the European Union and being \\"world citizens.\\"A yawning 260x260pxLongman asserted that another consequence of low fertility is the increasing difficulty of financing welfare programs, such as pension schemes and elderly care, ordinary family functions that had been appropriated by the state. This is because while life expectancy has grown only slightly in recent decades, fertility has fallen dramatically, meaning the widening dependency ratio is largely due to the fact that many of the taxpayers needed to finance these programs were never even born. Raising taxes would depress fertility rates even further. As a result, they will have to be scaled back or even abolished and family units that are less dependent on government will become more common as these now enjoy an evolutionary advantage. Longman also predicted that single-child households would find their number dwindle as a percentage of the population because one child can only replace one parent, not both, and the descendants of families with many children will slowly become a majority and will retain the values that made such families possible. Of course, history contains cases of major youth revolts, with the 1960s being a recent example. But back in the post-war era, it was the norm for people to marry and have many children, with very little difference along social, political or religious lines. In the early twenty- first century, families with just one or no children have become a lot more common, meaning the future proponents of counterculture would likely find that their companions will have never existed. In his 2010 book, Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth? Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First Century, political and religious demographer Eric Kaufmann argued that the answer to the question raised in the title is in the affirmative because demographic realities pose real challenges to the assumption of the inevitability of secular and liberal progress. He observed that devout factions tend to have a significant fertility advantage over their more moderate counterparts and the non-religious. For instance, white Catholic women in France have on average half a child more than their white secular counterparts while the Amish in the United States have three to four times more children than their fellow Christians on average. Highly religious groups tend to isolate themselves from the secularizing effects of modern mainstream Western society, making it more likely that the children will retain their parents' faiths. At the same time, secular people generally have rather low fertility rates by comparison for a variety of reasons, such as materialism, individualism, the preference for the here and now, feminism, environmentalism, or general pessimism. Kaufmann projected that secularism will have a mixed future in Europe. It will remain strong in most Catholic countries, notably Ireland and Spain, but has essentially ground to a halt in Protestant Europe and in France, and will falter in Northwestern Europe by mid-century. He told Mercator Net that the only way to buckle the trend involves \\"a creed that touches the emotional registers can lure away the children of fundamentalists\\" and \\"a repudiation of multiculturalism.\\" He suggested that \\"secular nationalism\\" and moderate religion associated with the nation-state could be part of the mix, but these traditions have been losing support at a considerable rate. A 2017 projection by the Pew Research Center suggests that between 2015 and 2060, the human population would grow by about 32%. Among the major religious groups, only Muslims (70%) and Christians (34%) are above this threshold and as such would have a higher share of the global population than they do now, especially Muslims. Hindus (27%), Jews (15%), followers of traditional folk religions (5%), and the religiously unaffiliated (3%) would grow in absolute numbers, but would be in relative decline because their rates of growth are below the global average. On the other hand, Buddhists would find their numbers shrink by 7% during the same period. This is due to sub-replacement fertility and population aging in Buddhist-majority countries such as China, Japan, and Thailand. This projection has taken into account religious switching. Moreover, previous research suggests that switching plays only a minor role in the growth or decline of religion compared to fertility and mortality. Eric Kaufmann's Whiteshift is an extensive study of how the migration-driven demographic transformation of the West affects the ballot box. The title of the 2018 book encodes Kaufmann's predictions that, as a result of international migration, Western countries will become ever more ethnically diverse and a growing number of people will be of mixed heritage. He further argues that the category of 'white people' will be enlarged to include more ethnically diverse individuals. For Kaufmann, one of the major schisms in the political landscape of the West at the time of writing is due to factions that want to speed up this process and those who want to slow it down. He suggested that the surge of nationalism and populism observed in many Western countries is due to the latter group. For decades, the norms of acceptable political demands had been established by the media, institutions of higher education, and mainstream political groups. Such norms include what he called \\"left modernism,\\" a more precise term for what is commonly referred to as political correctness, and \\"asymmetrical multiculturalism,\\" or the idea that all cultures present in a given society deserve to be preserved except the host culture. These norms have prevented mainstream politicians and political parties from responding to the concerns of large swathes of the voting population, giving nationalist populists an opportunity to rise to the front. In a related book, National Populism ‚Äì The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy, political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin attempted to explain the political phenomenon of the same name using a '4D model': _d_ estruction of the national culture due to large-scale international migration; _d_ eprivation of opportunities due to globalization and in the post-industrial economy with its frequent disruptions and slow growth; growing _d_ istrust by working-class and rural voters who feel increasingly alienated by liberal cosmopolitan city-dwelling political and media elites; and _d_ e-alignment from traditional allegiances, which can be seen in high levels of voter volatility, or people switching from one party to another between elections. National populism should not be confused with left- wing populism, which focuses on socioeconomic class rather than love of country. Eatwell and Goodwin observed that support for mainstream social democratic parties all across Europe has plummeted ‚Äì in France and the Netherlands the socialists got pushed to the fringe ‚Äì and predicted that nationalism and populism would remain a dominant characteristic of Western politics until the other side can build a platform that resonates better with the general public. Even after some surprising political developments such as the 2016 United Kingdom European Union Membership Referendum (Brexit), many mainstream politicians still believed their constituents wanted more immigration, more deregulation, more globalization, and more cultural diversity, when YouGov opinion polls of European voters showed that their number one concern was immigration.

Its construction was delayed by a financial crisis and its development terminated by World War II. Design and development In the mid-1930s there was international interest in short span but high performance sailplanes, because their ability to turn tightly would enable them to remain within narrow thermals. The German Darmstadt D-28 Windspiel, built in 1933, was an early example. The structure of the later, experimental Promyk () was almost twice as heavy as that of the delicate Windspiel, though the span was slightly less. Otherwise known as the TS-1/34, its design was started in 1934 but construction in the ZASPL workshops in Lw√≥w was delayed by a financial crisis in Poland between 1935 and 1936 which led to a government clampdown on prototype building. The delay gave Stƒôpniewki the opportunity to make the Promyk the first Polish sailplane with flaps. It finally flew in the spring of 1937. The single-seat Promyk was an all-wood aircraft with a cantilever, one piece wing which was trapezoidal in plan out to rounded tips. Sources differ somewhat on its construction: Cynk describes it as a two spar structure, samolotypolskie as having a single spar, assisted by an angled auxiliary strut. It was covered by a mixture of plywood and fabric. The camber-changing split flaps, inboard of the ailerons, had a maximum deflection of 40¬∞ and could act as airbrakes as well as increasing low speed lift. The wing was mounted over an oval-section, ply-covered semi- monocoque fuselage on a short faired pylon, ahead of which was an enclosed cockpit. A sprung landing skid ran under the forward fuselage; aft, the fuselage became slender before ending at an integral, ply-covered fin which carried a rounded, fabric-covered, balanced rudder. The Promyk had a one- piece, ply- and fabric-covered horizontal tail strut-mounted over the fuselage in front of the fin. Operational history The Promyk was test flown at Lw√≥w over the summer of 1937 by Zbigniew ≈ªabski, after which it went to Warsaw for ITL airworthiness trials. Its general handling was praised and its ability to soar in low lift conditions highlighted. From the autumn of 1937 it was engaged in manoeuvrability research in an ITL-supported programme designed by Ole≈Ñski and flown by him and Ciastula. After this ended in 1939 the Promyk went to Bezmiechowa G√≥rna, where it made some cross-country flights. Further development was prevented by the outbreak of World War II.

It is a member of the Rams family of games and, although it is a gambling game, often played for small stakes, it is also suitable as a party game or as a family game with children from the age of 12 upwards.  Name  Mistigri is a variant of Mouche or Lenterlu and a cousin of the English Lanterloo. It is known in Germany as M√∂nch (\\"Monk\\"), possibly a corruption of the French Mouche as Monche was the old German for monk. Meyer certainly equates it to Mouche, Lenturla and Pamphile, while Grupp also states that it is known as Trente et un (\\"Thirty-One\\") in French, but M√©ry's research shows that Mistigri was derived from Mouche (which was also called Lenturlu) and was first named Pamphile. It is related to the historical card game of Tippen. The game is named after the \\"mistigri\\" (French for \\"pussy cat\\" or \\"kitten\\"); both it and \\"M√∂nch\\" (\\"monk\\") are nicknames for the Jack of Clubs or Unter of Acorns, which may be used as the highest trump and as a wild card.  History  Mistigri is a card game that has been known and documented over several centuries. According to Kastner & Folkvord, it was predominantly played in bars and among families, but gained a \\"rather dubious reputation\\" as a gambling game. Mistigri was developed from an older French game known as Mouche (\\"Fly\\") or Lenturlu during the 18th century. Mistigri was originally called Pamphile, but the term 'mistigri' came into use during the 19th century as a nickname for the Jack of Clubs and gave its name in turn to the game. According to M√©ry, Pamphile and Mistigri are therefore the same game and a variant of Mouche or Lenturlu.M√©ry, L'Arbitre des jeux, Paris, Gabriel de Gonet, 1847 The game of Loo, also known as \\"Lanterloo\\", which is well known in the English-speaking world as a 5-card or 3-card game and was derived from French Lenturlu, is thus a cousin of Mistigri. Also related to it in the German-speaking world are the well-known games of Ramscheln and Mauscheln, in which only one player may exchange his hand cards against the so-called widow. In France it developed into the game of Bourr√©; in Spain into Julep and, building on Loo, in Ireland into Irish Loo. Other variants of the game are Norseman's Knock, Cucumber, Toepen and Hasenpfeffer.  Cards  Mistigri is a trick-taking game, but it also contains elements that resemble the game of poker. It is usually played by three or four players with a 32-card German-suited pack. If more play, a 52-card French pack may be used. The cards rank as follows: A > K > O > U > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7. Card values are as follows: * Ace (Deuce) ‚Äì 11 points * King, Ober, Unter and Ten ‚Äì 10 points * Nine, Eight and Seven ‚Äì 9, 8 and 7 points respectively  Playing  The following rules are based on Grupp (1975).  Stakes  Each player pays the agreed stake (a chip or coin) into a pot.  Dealing and exchanging  Beginning with forehand to his left, the dealer deals a packet of three cards to each player, followed by a second packet of two cards; each player receiving a hand of five cards. The next card is turned as trumps. In clockwise order, beginning with forehand, players decide whether to \\"pass\\" (ich passe or je passe), e.g. if they have a poor hand, and drop out of the particular game in progress or to announce \\"I'll join in\\" (ich gehe mit or je m'y tiens) or \\"play\\" (c'est bon). The active players may now, in rotation again, lay face down as many of their hand cards as they wish and exchange them for the same number of cards from the talon. They need not exchange any, of course. The aim of exchanging is either to acquire a flush of five cards of the same suit or, failing that, to acquire as many high value cards or trump cards as possible.  Fliege  If a player succeeds in getting a five-card flush, a so-called mouche or Fliege (\\"fly\\"), he wins immediately and takes the entire contents of the pot. The five cards do not have to form a sequence. The other players have to pay another stake to the pot. If two players have a flush, the one with the trump flush wins. If neither has a trump flush, the winner is decided on card points, where Ace = 11, Courts = 10 and pip cards count their natural value.  Trick-taking  If no-one has a flush, the game proceeds to the trick-taking phase. Forehand leads to the first trick and the winner of the trick leads to the next. Players must follow suit (Farbzwang) if they can, trump if they cannot follow (Trumpfzwang) and must head the trick if possible (Stichzwang).  Winnings  For each trick taken, the player earns a fifth of the pot. If a player takes no tricks, they must pay the basic stake as a penalty.  Mistigri  The feature of this member of the Rams family is the Mistigri, the Jack of Clubs or Unter of Acorns, which is always the highest trump regardless of the trump suit. The player holding this card may play it and, at the same time, announce any suit of his choice as trumps. The Mistigri also counts as a wild card in that, if a player has 4 cards of the same suit, he may count the Mistigri as the 5th in order to make a flush.  M√∂nch  M√∂nch, as described by Kastner and Folkvord, has a few slight variations or refinements. A 36-card or 52-card pack, depending on the number of players, is used and each player has 25 chips, the basic stake being five. Exchanging is limited to 4 cards maximum and there is provision for the discards to be shuffled and used for further exchanging if the talon is exhausted. In the event of two players having a flush, the player with the lower flush does not have to pay a penalty nor does the player with the M√∂nch. The pot has a limit of 40 chips, any excess going into a side pot which tops up the main pot when it drops below 40. If all players pass, the dealer gets 5 chips from rearhand. Game may be a fixed number of points, e.g. 50, or a set number of deals. If forehand plays the Trump Ace to the first trick, he can insist that the M√∂nch 'keeps still' (still h√§lt - see \\"Pam be civil\\" in Loo) and is not played to that trick. Finally, if Clubs are the trump suit, players may not drop out (see 'club law' in Loo).  References  Grupp (1975), pp. 24‚Äì25. \\"Meyers (1908), p. 907. Kastner & Folkvord (2005), pp. 63‚Äì65.

He is an ACM Fellow and the Chair in Informatics and Computational Science for the year 2018‚Äì2019 at Coll√®ge de France for distributed computing.  Education and career  Rachid was born on January 5, 1967 in Rabat, Morocco. His father, Mohammed Guerraoui, is a teacher of mathematics and former wali (governor) of Marrakesh. His mother, Fatima Rahmoun-Guerraoui, is a teacher of French. After getting his baccalaureate in 1984, he left Morocco for France. Guerraoui received his PhD from University of Orsay (1992) and has been affiliated with Ecole des Mines of Paris, the Commissariat √† l'Energie Atomique of Saclay, Hewlett Packard Laboratories and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is an associate (area) editor of the Journal of the ACM and is the co-author of several books, including \\"Algorithms for Concurrent Systems\\", \\"Introduction to Reliable and Secure Distributed Programming\\" and \\"Principles of Transactional Memory\\". He won an ERC Advanced Grant Award (2013) and the Google Focused Award (2014). With his co-workers, Guerraoui received Best Paper Awards at the following scientific conferences: ACM Middleware (2016, 2014, 2012), ICDCN (2011), Eurosys (2010), DISC (2010) and OPODIS (2006). He also received the 10-Year Best Paper Award at Middleware 2014, Beyond his scientific and academic work, Guerraoui works on popularization of computer science. He co-initiated the Wandida teaching project on YouTube, a library of 300++ videos on computer science and mathematics with 2.5 million views and over 25 thousand subscribers, as well as the Zettabytes education project, a library of videos related to introducing major computer science discoveries and open problems to the general public. Rachid maintains strong ties to Morocco through his participation in the public debate and the Moroccan political life. In December 2019, he was appointed by King Mohammed VI as a member of the Special Committee on Model of Development.  Focal research areas and main publications  Guerraoui worked on establishing theoretical foundations of Transactional Memory (TM). He co-defined a concept he called opacity, used for establishing correctness of TMs. On the practical side, he co-devised elastic transactions and co-designed SwissTM, a throughput-efficient software transactional memory (STM) as well as a benchmark for TM systems, STMBench7. Earlier, Guerraoui studied scalable information dissemination methods. His paper on lightweight epidemic broadcast was the first to consider the partial and/or out-of-sync views of different processes in a gossip-based distributed system. This paper, together with Guerraoui's paper on the underlying membership service, gained over 1250 citations combined as of 2018, among which a number of theory papers on the analysis of gossip protocols in realistic settings. Rachid Guerraoui has a proven record of investigating the foundations of asynchronous distributed computations. For instance, Guerraoui co-established lower bounds for asynchronous gossiping and renaming. He further proved fundamental results on the relationships between classical distributed computing problems, such as atomic commitment and consensus, for which he helped close the then open problem of the weakest failure detector for consensus with any number of faults and co-established a new classification of distributed computing problems. Guerraoui further co-defined a general methodology to build highly concurrent asynchronous data structures and has shown how asynchrony can help build pseudo-random numbers. Guerraoui invented the mathematical abstraction of indulgence to precisely capture the essence of asynchronous algorithms of which safety does not depend on timing assumptions, such as Lamport's Paxos or Castro-Liskov's PBFT. Guerraoui used that concept to co-define a general framework for secure and reliable distributed protocols.

He was an important figure for the development of Battery Park City in Manhattan and for the elimination of rent control in New York. Appointed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller, Urstadt was New York State Housing Commissioner from 1969 to 1971. He became known as the first chairman of the Battery Park City Authority, a public benefit corporation that created a mixed use development on 92 acres of landfill on the lower west side of Manhattan. In 1973, he joined Douglas Elliman, one of New York's largest real estate companies. Urstadt later joined Urstadt Biddle Properties in 1975, where he became chairman emeritus upon his retirement in 2019.  Early life  Born in 1928, Urstadt was the son of Claire (Jordan) and Charles George Urstadt. His great-grandfather was born on a farm in the Bronx in 1840 and his grandfather purchased buildings in the borough in 1920s. Urstadt grew up in one of the buildings his grandfather owned and his father managed on West 195th Street in the Bronx. Urstadt graduated from the Bronx High School of Science at age sixteen. He graduated from Dartmouth College, Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business and Cornell Law School. Early career In 1953, he joined the New York law firm of Nevius, Brett & Kellogg as an attorney. A year later, he enlisted in the United States Navy for two years. Urstadt served as vice president and counsel of Zeckendorf Property Corporation after working as assistant secretary and counsel of its parent company Webb & Knapp. In 1963, he was named as secretary and counsel of Alcoa Residences, a subsidiary of Alcoa Properties. In 1965, he was named vice president of Alcoa Residences.  New York State Housing Commissioner  In 1967, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller appointed Urstadt as deputy commissioner of the division of housing and community renewal. He was promoted to commissioner in 1969. In 1971, the state legislature approved a bill that ended rent control on New York City apartments as tenants voluntarily vacated them. The process was known as vacancy decontrol. Urstadt was instrumental in writing the bill. Also that year, the legislature passed what became known as the \\"Urstadt Law,\\" which transferred power over rent control laws from city to state lawmakers. Proponents of the measures said the city's rent control program was outdated, discouraged renovation of apartment buildings and had driven new housing from the city with losses of 20,000 units a year. Critics said the laws bypassed home rule for the city. Six months after the vacancy decontrol law was passed, Urstadt said new housing starts went up 237% in three months. Urstadt credited vacancy decontrol as a major factor contributing to the increase. Urstadt resigned his position as commissioner in 1973 to avoid conflict of interest when he and four partners bought the Manhattan real estate firm of Douglas L. Elliman & Co.  Battery Park City  In 1968, in addition to his duties with the New York state division of housing, Urstadt was appointed chairman of the Battery Park City Authority by Gov. Rockefeller. The state agency was created to develop 92 acres along the southern tip of Manhattan including 88 acres of submerged land along the Hudson River from Battery Park to Chambers Streets. The development was to include 21,000 housing units as well as office space and parks. The project was soon caught in disputes between state and city officials over design and other matters. Then, the New York real estate market slowed amid concerns over the city's fiscal condition. Despite uncertain financial and real estate markets, the landfill was completed and ground was broken for the first six buildings in 1974. By 1975, foundation work was underway for the first six buildings of the project. With the city in financial turmoil, a 1975 bond offering to finance construction of the first six buildings of the project failed. In 1978, work resumed on the development after 17 months of inactivity. The work involved a new roadway and utility support for the first six apartment buildings. Site work had been halted because of conditions set by the Carter Administration for federal financial guarantees. Urstadt said the American Stock Exchange and the New York Law School were considering moving to the development. In 1979, New York Governor Hugh Carey replaced Urstadt as Battery Park City Authority chairman with William D. Hassett Jr. Urstadt later returned to the Battery Park City Authority from 1996 to 2010 as vice chairman and board member. He was appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki. During a recession in 2009 in which the city was facing budget shortfalls, Urstadt proposed that the city exercise an option to purchase the Battery Park City land for $1. The option was part of the agreement that transferred title from the city to the Battery Park City Authority. He argued the city could take back the land from the authority along with the $200 million in annual rents and payments from developers. Urstadt proposed that the $1.1 billion bonds issued by the authority could be satisfied by the sale of the income from the commercial leases as revenue from the commercial sale would come to at least $2 billion leaving a surplus after the bonds were paid off. He also suggested that by dissolving the authority, an overall savings of $15 million could be achieved. The Independent Budget Office of the City of New York also recommended the city take over Battery Park City in a report published in February 2020. The report echoed Urstadt's proposal as a way to increase revenue to the city. An article published by the Broadsheet Daily described the complex shared ownership structure of Battery Park City between the city and state that was set up by Urstadt.  Real estate career  In 1973, GMU Associates, a partnership that included Urstadt and Edwin Jay Gould, bought a majority interest in Douglas L. Elliman & Co., one of New York's largest real estate companies. Urstadt later sold his interest in the company. An investment group led by Urstadt purchased Pearce, Mayer & Greer, Inc., a commercial mortgage and sales brokerage company, from W.R. Grace & Company in 1979. Urstadt served as the chief executive officer of the company. The company's name was later changed to Pearce, Urstadt, Mayer & Greer, Inc. In 1987, Urstadt sold the company to New York real estate investor Alex DiLorenzo. In 1975, Urstadt joined the board of directors of Hubbard Real Estate Investments, a real estate investment trust listed on the New York Stock Exchange. He became chief executive officer in 1989. Once he took over as CEO, Urstadt changed the company's focus from a diverse portfolio to one specializing in neighborhood shopping centers in the suburban New York region. The centers were typically anchored by grocery stores in affluent communities. The new strategy took advantage of the company's extensive market knowledge and allowed for more efficient management of the properties. An important part of Urstadt's plan was to keep the company's debt low relative to the size of its assets. The company was later renamed Urstadt Biddle Properties, Inc. The Urstadt and Biddle families owned about 25% of the company in 2013. That year, Urstadt stepped down as chief executive officer of the company but remained as chairman. Willing L. Biddle, the president of the company, then became the chief executive officer. In 2018, the company owned or had interests in 84 properties containing approximately 5.1 million square feet of space. Urstadt retired as chairman in 2019 and was named chairman emeritus. His son, Charles D. Urstadt, was named chairman of Urstadt Biddle Properties.  Personal life  In 1957, Urstadt married Elinor McClure Funk of Santa Monica, California. They had two children, Charles Deane Urstadt and Catherine Urstadt Biddle. His daughter Catherine is married to Willing L. Biddle, the president of Urstadt Biddle Properties. When Urstadt turned 72 years old in 2000, he became the world champion swimmer for the 50-meter breaststroke in the 70 to 75 age group in tournaments held by the amateur Masters Swimming organization. He beat out 28 swimmers in the competition. Urstadt had not competed as a swimmer since his high school years when he won the New York City High School Championships three years in a row and then at Dartmouth College as captain of the swim team. Urstadt died at his home in Bronxville, New York, on March 3, 2020, of stroke-related complications, aged 91. References  Further reading  * Urstadt, Charles J.; Gene Brown (2005).

The incident gave rise to her nickname, \\"Bloody Mary,\\" and a series of rumors about her supposed cruelty.  Biography   Early life  Mary Ann Partington was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, on March 22, 1889 to Harold James and Ella Rhatigan Partington. Partington's father, Harold James Partington (February 28, 1865 - July 7, 1944), was an English immigrant who had come to the United States in 1885 to work as a dairyman. Harold James Partington married Ella Partington (n√©e Rhatigan) in Lincoln on October 21, 1887. Ella Partington (December 4, 1865 - April 23, 1923) was born in Bernard, Iowa as the daughter of Irish immigrants. Ella had graduated from St. Mary's Academy in Dubuque and came to Nebraska to work as a schoolteacher in McCook. Ella later moved to Lincoln to work as a seamstress and waitress at the Lincoln Hotel before becoming the cook and housekeeper for the Abbott family. Mary was the eldest of nine children who grew up tending to chores on the farm they rented from the Abbotts. Mary and her siblings walked to school in the nearby town of University Place, a suburb of Lincoln. In 1906, the family moved into a twelve-room house which they had built at 44th and Superior Streets. The Partington's house was quite large for the time period and area, when most farmhouses had three bedrooms. The Partington house had six bedrooms, two parlors, a recreation room, a windmill which pumped water directly to the house and barns, a 3,000 gallon water tank, and plumbing which carried sewage to a nearby pond. The house was described as the \\"marvel\\" of the area. For much of Mary's youth, her home was a hub of activity in the community. Classmates, friends, and neighbors would flock to the Partington home for parties. Harold Partington offered an open invitation to the community to skate on his pond in the winter or come sit on his porch in the summer to watch the fireworks on the Fourth of July.  Career  Mary Partington graduated from the University of Nebraska on May 27, 1918 with a bachelor's degree and a teaching certificate. Partington taught junior high students in Lewiston, Nebraska and later chemistry and science in Genoa, Nebraska. Students remembered Partington as a tall, unflappable, and authoritative woman who kept to herself and rarely left her boarding house. Mary's mother, Ella, died on April 23, 1923 while helping to push the family car out of the mud as Mary steered. Her mother's death greatly affected Mary, who held herself responsible. During Ella's funeral service, Mary began to wail aloud and was escorted out. Mary retired from teaching after her mother's death, occasionally working as a substitute teacher at local schools. Instead of teaching, Mary stayed home to help care for the farm, her father, and younger siblings. Mary never married, but kept herself busy and well-connected with her community through volunteering, substitute teaching at St. Patrick's school in Havelock, leading local children in 4-H, and her membership in the Havelock Extension Club. Mary was fondly remembered by the children she taught and volunteered with, who said that she could inspire the best in people and make them believe that they were \\"the best.\\"  Later years  After her father's death in 1944, Partington continued to live alone in the house on a tract of wooded land in what is today Lincoln's Boosalis Park. Partington never brought electricity or modern plumbing to the house. At some point, Mary invited William Kline to rent portions of her land to raise pigs. Kline hired Clarence 'Pig Man' Higby to care for his hogs. Partington never drove a car after her mother's death, instead riding her bike or walking wherever she went, regardless of the weather. Partington also continued to wear the old- fashioned clothing she had worn growing up. Partington's father had deeded her the land, tax free, but she had very little income. Partington raised goats, chickens, and vegetables to feed herself. As the city grew around her home in the 1950s and 1960s, the land around her home became increasingly suburban. Mary happily babysat her neighbors' children and brought them gifts on every holiday. Neighbors made a habit of checking in on Mary and giving her rides in their cars. Because her home was not electrified, there was virtually no sign of habitation on the property at night. This, combined with its seclusion and \\"overgrown\\" appearance, caused teenagers from other parts of the city to believe the house was abandoned. Beginning in the 1960s, curious teenagers would trespass on the property at night. Fraternities at the University of Nebraska began to include trips to Partington's house as part of their initiation rites. The seclusion of her home combined with her independent nature and habit of wearing old-fashioned clothing made Partington the target of rumors and harassment by local teenagers. The harassment of Partington escalated and on October 25, 1961, Partington was shot by a group of trespassers through her window at night. The bullet hit Partington in the stomach and concerned neighbors who had heard the gunshots called the sheriff. The sheriff arrived but did not see anyone wounded outside the house and thus left. The next day, a stranger passed by Partington's house and Partington told her what had happened last night. The woman drove Partington to the hospital, where doctors removed a .22 caliber rifle slug from her abdomen. After the shooting, Partington acquired a gun which she used to frighten trespassers. Despite warning shots fired from her upstairs bedroom, trespassers continued to harass her, throwing rocks at her home, breaking windows, shooting at the walls, killing her goats, and painting obscenities on her house. A common dare was to go to the area at night, steal something from the 'Pig Man' and then steal something from Partington's home. On the advice of concerned neighbors and friends, Mary installed a telephone in her home in 1961. Multiple times Partington awoke to intruders in her home. In 1962, an unknown man broke into Mary's home, blindfolded her, tied her to a chair, put a gun to her head, and demanded she tell him where she kept her food and valuables. The assailant left with his stolen goods and Mary freed herself, but the incident left her scared. On the night of October 26, 1966, Mary was awakened by the sounds of a commotion outside her house. Partington called the sheriff but no law enforcement came. Mary stayed in her bedroom until she heard the window in her kitchen break an hour later. Partington descended the stairs with her shotgun and saw a man's head coming through her kitchen window. Mary fired once at the man and he fell backwards. Partington believed she had merely scared the young man away and called again for the police. When police arrived, they found the body of Earl Eldon Hill, a local man who had been recently discharged from a mental hospital. Partington had shot him in the cheek and he had died instantly. Due to the nature of the incident, Partington was not charged for the killing and it was deemed an act of self defense. The harassment continued, despite frequent visits from the local law enforcement, Partington's warning shots, the killing of Earl Hill, and numerous letters to the editor in which Mary pleaded with the youth of the city to leave her alone. After her sister's death, Partington lacked a reliable support network in town. At her niece Mary Ann Davis' urging, Partington moved from her beloved home into the nearby city of Lincoln in 1976. In 1977, an arsonist burned down her abandoned home and Partington died two years later in 1979.  Legacy and legend  Mary Partington was a devoutly Catholic woman who was also very proud of her Irish heritage. Partington was also a strong proponent of education. Partington believed that her grandmother, Ann Clarke Rhatigan, was closely related to Sister Mary Frances Clarke, the founder of Clarke College in Dubuque, Iowa. Upon her death, Mary Partington left $20,200 to Clarke College and $20,200 to Creighton University Medical Center. The charred remains of the Partington homestead were cleared and the land was returned to its original state, bequeathed to the city of Lincoln, and is now part of Lincoln's Helen Boosalis Park. Despite being publicly owned, the land is not open to the public. This is partially due to the rumors surrounding the land and also because of the large amounts of trash in the woods. Stories about Partington typically involve her neighbors William Kline, who owned the tract of densely-wooded land next to hers, and Clarence 'Pig Man' Higby, Kline's employee who tended Kline's pigs on the land. Kline worked as a garbage collector and fed his pigs with the refuse he collected, he dumped the inedible garbage around his land, sometimes as makeshift fencing for his hogs. The mysterious piles of refuse and the reclusive inhabitants of the land contributed to the rumors about the woods. Some stories claim that Partington was a witch and that her ghost can still be seen haunting her land in north Lincoln. The ghost stories may have arisen from early encounters between Mary and the trespassers in which a \\"ghostly\\" Partington would appear in a white nightgown in her bedroom window. Because the house was presumed to be abandoned, the trespassers reasoned that she must be a ghost. Despite rumors and local urban legends which depict Partington as cruel or malevolent, interviews with people who personally interacted with Partington almost universally describe her as a kind woman with eccentric habits. Her uncommon lifestyle, outdated clothes and house, and independence made her the subject of rumors which developed into urban legends.

Tierney (born 1982) is an American paleoclimatologist who has worked with geochemical proxies such as marine sediments, mud, and TEX86, to study past climate in East Africa. Her papers have been cited more than 2,500 times; her most cited work is Northern Hemisphere Controls on Tropical Southeast African Climate During the Past 60,000 Years. Tierney is currently an associate professor of geosciences at the University of Arizona.  Early life and education  Tierney was born in San Francisco, California, and grew up in Marin County. Tierney completed her bachelor's degree in geology in 2005 at Brown University, where she researched trace elements in Peru Margin sediments for her thesis. She completed her Masters and PhD in geology at Brown University with a focus in paleoclimatology and organic geochemistry under the advisement of James M. Russell. At Brown, she also worked closely with Yongsong Huang. Sediment cores from Lake Tanganyika allowed Tierney to examine changes in precipitation and temperature during the past glacial cycle in East Africa. She completed her postdoctoral work at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory with paleo-oceanographer Peter deMenocal. Tierney worked as an assistant scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution before arriving at the University of Arizona where she is an associate professor.  Research  Tierney is notable in paleoclimatology for her climate research using organic biomarkers. Her career studying past climate change was driven by her passion for both history and science. Tierney, along with Peter deMenocal and Paul Zander, studied the past climate of the Horn of Africa. They took cores of marine sediment, testing for alkenones, and concluded that about 70,000 years ago this region experienced a change from a wet climate to a dry, cold climate. Tierney and the co-authors determine this climate shift, which coincides with climate change and human activity, to be the force behind human migration. In addition, Tierney uses mud and leaf wax to learn about precipitation and the evolution of monsoons. Tierney also uses TEX86, a biomarker that tracks temperature, to study past climate in the tropics on decadal and interannual scales; for example, examining the relationship Indo- Pacific variability and East African rainfall.

Background and education  Sue Natali was born on July 18, 1969, and was raised in Elmwood Park, New Jersey. She has three sisters and a brother. In 1991, Natali graduated from Villanova University, where she received a B.S. in biology, and in 2008 she completed her Ph.D. in ecology and evolution at Stony Brook University. Natali worked with academic advisors Manuel Lerdau and Sergio Sa√±udo-Wilhelmy at Stony Brook University while pursuing her Ph.D., and wrote her thesis on the \\"Effects of Elevated CO2 on Trace Metal Cycling in Plants and Soils\\".  Career and research  After completing her Ph.D. in 2008, Natali became a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Florida, where she was employed as a postdoctoral associate until 2010. From 2010 to 2012, Natali was appointed as a postdoctoral research fellow of the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs. Afterwards, Natali joined the Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC) as an assistant scientist, and in 2015 was appointed as an associate scientist at the WHRS, where she currently conducts research. Notably, Natali conducted an experiment that tests how periods of warming and the thawing of tundra permafrost might impact the carbon cycle. In 2015, Natali conducted an experiment in the Arctic tundra to examine the impacts soil drying has on the release of carbon and methane into the atmosphere. She found that the drying of tundra soil drastically increases the amount of carbon and methane emitted into the atmosphere as permafrost thaws. Natali's research has been publicized by the New York Times and CBS News. Natali strives to bring the thawing of permafrost and its adverse impacts to the public eye, and has done so through participation in interviews and speaking on public radio programs. She also works as a leader of the Polaris Project, which is an initiative to engage undergraduate students in research of Arctic permafrost. The project is funded by the National Science Foundation. Natali was also invited to speak at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference about the importance of recognizing permafrost as a significant contributor to carbon emissions and climate change.  Major publications  These are some of Natali's most cited publications: * Climate change and the permafrost carbon feedback (2015) * Climate change: High risk of permafrost thaw (2011) * Increased plant productivity in Alaskan tundra as a result of experimental warming of soil and permafrost (2012) * Expert assessment of vulnerability of permafrost carbon to climate change (2013) * Effects of experimental warming of air, soil and permafrost on carbon balance in Alaskan tundra (2011) * Biomass offsets little or none of permafrost carbon release from soils, streams, and wildfire: an expert assessment (2016) *Permafrost degradation stimulates carbon loss from experimentally warmed tundra (2014)  Awards and fellowships  In 2006, Natali was awarded the Association for Women in Science Ruth Satter Predoctoral Award. From 2006 to 2007 she was granted a U.S. Department of Energy Global Change Education Program graduate fellowship.

Finding that '√æa√∞ var skemmtilegra a√∞ lesa fornar √≠slenskar b√≥kmenntir heldur en √æ√¶r ensku' ('more entertaining to read Old Icelandic literature than English'), he began teaching Old Icelandic at Keele, and in September 1978 paid his first, week-long visit to the island, finding its autumn drizzle congenial to his temperament. His research interests shifted gradually to Iceland and he became a regular visitor; his work focused on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English visitors to Iceland, and the reception of medieval Icelandic literature in Britain. In 1983, Wawn moved to the University of Leeds, building on a heritage of Icelandic studies there dating back to the interwar teaching of J. R. R. Tolkien and E. V.

The estate was acquired byChristian Heinrich August Hardenberg-Reventlow of Krenkerup in 1801 and has been owned by his descendants since then. The three-winged main building and the home farm were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1960. The buildings were delisted in 2012 and demolished in 2013. History Early history The estate was originally known as S√¶byg√•rd. In 1355, Ludvig Albertsen Eberstein granted it to Halsted Priory. In circa 1400, it was ceded to the Crown. The Papenheim and Ruud families In 1565, Frederick II gave S√¶bygaard to Burchard von Papenheim who had until then been the lensmand of the estate. After Papenheim's death in 1590, it was passed to his son-in-law Eiler Rud. He was already the owner of Utterslevg√•rd. After Rud's death in 1618, S√¶byg√•rd and Utterslevg√•rd was passed to his only child, Borkvard Rud, He constructed new buildings on the S√¶byg√•rd estate, drained the land and constructed dykes to protect it from flooding. He died as the last male member of the family in 1647. His widow, Helvig Jakobsdatter Rosenkrantz. kept the estate until 1660 when it was ceded to Rud's cousin, Lene Rud. The Winterfeldt family After Lene Rud's death in1671, her heirs sold the estate to Helmuth Otto von Winterfeldt. He served as lord chamberlain from 1670 to 1789. He created the Barony of Vintersborg from the estates in 1673. He renamed S√¶byg√•rd S√¶byholm and expanded the estate significantly through the acquisition of more land. The Hardenberg-Reventlow family Frederik Christian Holck-Winterfeldt chose to dissolve the barony in 1801 and then ceded S√¶byholm to count Christian Heinrich August Hardenberg-Reventlow in exchange for Fjellebro and Skovgaard. Christian Heinrich August Hardenberg- Reventlow managed S√¶byholm as a farm under Krenkerup, the centre of the countship he had created in 1815. A new main building was constructed for Ida Augusta Hardenberg-Reventlow in 1856. The Countship of Hardenberg-Reventlow was dissolved in 1925 as a result of the lensafl√∏sningsloven of 1919. Henrik Ludwig Erdmann Georg Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow parted with 230 hectares of land from the S√¶byholms estate in connection with the transaction. The buildings were delisted in 2012.

Brought up in the country region of Battambang where took up studies in Phare Ponleu Selpak art school, she learnt how to paint using oil and water colour as well as refining her pencil skills. In December 2007, she met Dana Langlois, a fellow artist who owned the java caf√© and gallery who also let Oeur have her first show which she earned money from. In February 2008, she moved to Phnom Penh to become a professional artist. Her parents were not supportive of her career choice at the beginning with Sokuntevy saying in an interview that they threw all her art away, and instead wanted her to be a woman adhering to the traditional norms in Cambodia and therefore lived with her aunt. Later in 2015, Sokuntevy moved to Berlin with her husband to learn about the art there and meet other artists as well as to show people Cambodian living and culture through her painting.Asialife, Sokuntevy Oeur, 2015.  Art  Sokuntevy's art follows the surrealism movement. Although her art takes a modern approach, some elements of appreciation of traditional Cambodian art can be found in her work such as her use of bold shapes and color. At first however while she lived in Battambang, although the medium she used, coffee with paper, was unique, the ideas she depicted were traditional. When she moved to Phnom Penh in 2007, her experiences with people, learning a different language, and travelling led her to morph her style into a surrealism approach. Sokuntevy's art depicts things and situations found in everyday life and according to her, \\"what is happening here\\" such as families, women and the limitations faced by them in Cambodia, life in Cambodia, and Khmer values with a satirical take. Tevy's used medium nowadays are paint however she has experimented with different mediums such as sculptural works made from rattan, bamboo, coffee, paint and homemade paper in her second solo exhibition in 2007.Javaarts, exhibitions, 2007.  Themes in Sokuntevy's art  Throughout all her painting and exhibitions, Sokuntevy expresses a theme. In her exhibition Ping vey, the theme Tevy's understanding of the \\"Cambodia of today\\".Yang, \\"Ping Vey: A surreal coming of age\\", 2012. Lost together is an art work from the exhibition titled Ping Vey. The painting depicts a man and a woman in the form of pigs which is a reference to Sokuntevy's Zodiac sign.Yang, \\"Ping Vey: A surreal coming of age\\", 2012. They are standing on a balcony and looking into the distance, portraying a married couple having some quality time together.Yang, \\"Ping Vey: A surreal coming of age\\", 2012. According to Calvin Yang, writer at the Phnom Penh Post, a closer look at the facial expressions of this couple reveals a grim expression that might, in his opinion portray the loathing an bitterness in the marriage. A string attached from the husband's snout to the wife's snout depicts an attachment which Sokuntevy explains as \\"When there is marriage, there is a connection between both parties\\" and \\"five to ten years later, the connection is still there but they lose the feelings they had for each other.\\"Yang, \\"Ping Vey: A surreal coming of age\\", 2012. According to Sokuntevy, this painting reflects what Tevy sees as having different view on marriage then her parents.Yang, \\"Ping Vey: A surreal coming of age\\", 2012. In another exhibition titled \\"free and easy\\" Sokuntevy uses the theme of Cambodia's views on homosexuality.Poynton, \\"Young woman's art explores the homosexuality\\", 2007. Her paintings show a variety of homosexual love from the tender to the graphic with Sokuntevy stating that \\"In Cambodia no one knows about men with men, they think its dirty\\" and further explaining her views. \\"I was shocked when I first saw them too, but I don't think they're wrong, they can love each other too.\\"Poynton, \\"Young woman's art explores the homosexuality\\", 2007. In 2012, Sokuntevy created an exhibition titled Fantasies and in this exhibition the theme is the life of women in Cambodia juggling their desires, obligations whilst facing never ending demands from society.Kolesnikov-Jesop, \\"Oeur Sokuntevy depicts Cambodian women aspirations\\", 2012. \\"I feel the situation between the men and women is a bit unfair: women have to work, cook, and take care of the children; and men sometimes have it easier\\" explains Sokuntevy as to why the theme was prevalent in this exhibition.Kolesnikov-Jesop, \\"Oeur Sokuntevy depicts Cambodian women aspirations\\", 2012. Notable paintings from this exhibition include Never Enough and Fantasy. In Never Enough a woman is depicted in a Cambodian traditional dress making flavored shaved ice whilst several open hands face her expecting to be fed.Kolesnikov-Jesop, \\"Oeur Sokuntevy depicts Cambodian women aspirations\\", 2012. In Fantasy, a poor woman inhabiting a wooden house in the rural areas is dreaming of wearing provocative lingerie.Kolesnikov- Jesop, \\"Oeur Sokuntevy depicts Cambodian women aspirations\\", 2012.  Exhibitions and paintings   2007  Sokuntevy's first exhibition was at the java caf√© in Phon Penh titled Ancient Spirits. On paper soaked in coffee, Oeur tried to \\"repair the past\\" by using torn pieces from old temple paintings and using glue to stick them together.Sokuntevy, \\"About\\", 2007. Magical diagrams as well as texts with flowers, straw and other natural materials. The exhibition looked at the past while considering the future.  2010  In 2010, at the institute Francaise, Sokuntevy displayed her second exhibition called Love to Death. In this exhibition, Oeur challenged social norms in relation to love from the perspective of women. This exhibition showcased the different levels of desire, love and hate whilst giving the women and emboldening stance which contradicts the expectations of Asian culture.Sokuntevy, \\"About\\", 2010.  2011  A year later in 2011, another exhibition this time titled Love, Death, and Dream at utterly art, the main medium used is acrylic on paper. In this exhibition, superstitions and traditions of Cambodia were explored through her subconscious. Images of animals were constantly used which represent Cambodia's deep relation with nature, belief in the reincarnation, and the zodiac sign.  2012  Sokuntevy returned to Java gallery with a new exhibition named Ping Vey in 2012. The main character in this series was a pig (a reference to the zodiac signs) and the main representation is a psychological terrain. The fluctuations experienced by the character are emotional ones such as dreams, fears, and longing and are represented in scenes through symbolism and references.Sokuntevy, \\"About\\", 2012. Sokuntevy explained the exploration of psychological terrain as \\"a shift that is not restricted by gender and can resonate with many stages in life.Sokuntevy, \\"About\\", 2012. The same year, Oeur creates a second exhibition titled fantasies. Through heavy surrealism, a women's psyche was explored through the painting. The exhibition was a culmination of the fears, desire and wishes of females as well as a personal narrative that extended to a wider one. In this exhibition paintings included a woman offering her husband for sale, a woman enhancing her lips and breasts, and a woman caught in the nightmare of raising a sick child. Through this exhibition there was an exploration of the intersection of desire and obligation, a conflict and a burden.Sokuntevy, \\"About\\", 2012.  2013  The exhibition in 2013 was called feeding Cambodia at utterly art, Singapore. This exhibition took place in the newly-industrialized Cambodia which is also facing the fastest population and economic growth rate in Asia. The exhibition focused on the current state of the people and what they view as important, their desires, and other things they are influenced by. It grappled with the struggle between modern and traditional, past and future, and the old generation and new generation.  2014  In 2014 Sokuntevy delivered two exhibitions: one titled generation gap at utterly art Singapore, and the other named secrets at Java art gallery in Phon Penh. Generation gap represents Cambodia becoming a rapidly developing country and the juxtaposition of a rural country previously dependent on agriculture entering into the digital age. Using surrealism, Sokuntevy depicted the gap between a generation used to candlelight and farming with a new generation brought up with television, smartphones, and the internet and the wreck it has caused on \\"social mores\\" and \\"perspectives. \\"The secrets exhibition was a continuation of Oeur's previous elements such as subconscious and dream energy, however, there was a shift from previous storytelling and social and gender commentary to depicting scenes and portraits of fictionalized characters. Through satirical gestures viewed on the characters, the series investigated personal secrets.  2017  In 2017 Sokuntevy created an exhibition called Cambodia Berlin that is still ongoing till this day. This exhibition was created after Sokuntevy moved to Berlin with her husband and is at Schillepallais. The paintings in this exhibition depict Oeur's experience in a foreign land through painting everyday activities such as taking the public transport and shopping. The paintings aim to bring together two different cultures by showcasing their similarities and differences as well as aid Sokuntevy in finding her place in a foreign country. Notable artwork from the exhibition include Waiting spring in which \\"three women sit on public benches floating in space, each one focused on her phone or lost in her thoughts. A fourth sit nearby casually holding her dog's leash, both dog and mistress wearing sunglasses. The dog is the only one with eyes on the viewer,\\"Vachon, \\"In Surreal Images, Artist Speculates on Berliners' Inner Lives\\", 2017. and City Life Berlin which depicts \\"people rush to climb into a bus, obviously cold in their sweaters and scarves. The top of the bus becomes a surreal scene of people having coffee or casually working on computers with their torsos turning into a multicolor mist.\\"Vachon, \\"In Surreal Images, Artist Speculates on Berliners' Inner Lives\\", 2017.  Cambodian art  The art scene in Cambodia has evolved due to the country moving from a war era to a developing country that has become a main touristic destination. Local artists have started to infuse modern techniques with Cambodian elements and thus has allowed them to depict wider topics rather than farmers working their rice fields. According to English sculptor Sasha constable, the change to the fact that artists have become more experimental with their concepts and materials used. Nico Mesterharm, director of the Meta House Art Gallery in Phnom Penh attributed the change that was said to be started in 2005 when about 25 local artists started a project called visual arts open and thus igniting the move to contemporary art and away from paintings of landscapes, portraits and the Khmer Rouge.Hunt, Fledgling art scene more trippy than traditional, 2012. Cambodian art in recent years has gained the interest of an international audience. In 2012 and 2013, Corey, contributor in the section of The Journal of Khmer Studies titled \\"the 'first' Cambodian artists,\\" writes that Cambodian artists were showcased in prominent cities known for their contemporary art scene such as Kassel Germany, New York, and Berlin along with prominent museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Institut f√ºr Auslandsbeziehungen (Institute of Foreign Relations).Corey, The 'first' Cambodian contemporary artist, 2014. A season of Cambodian living art festival took over many stages in New York City during the months of April and May 2013. As part of the festival, the Museum of Modern Art launched a symposium called \\"Contemporary art in Cambodia: A Historical Inquiry\\". During this festival, exhibitions of 10 visual artists and one curator were displayed, along with dance, music, and theatre.  References  * AsiaLIFE Cambodia. (2015). Sokuntevy Oeur.

Bomera was designed by John F. Hilly and built in 1856 with alterations by Sheerin & Hennessy and built by Wheelwright & Alderson 1902. Tarana was designed by Edward H. Buchanan and built by John Alexander Oag in 1889, with additions including a third storey designed by Sheerin & Hennessy in 1907. The houses are also known as Boomera and Taranah. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000.  History  Aboriginal history The \\"Eora people\\" was the name given to the coastal Aborigines around Sydney. Central Sydney is therefore often referred to as \\"Eora Country\\". Within the City of Sydney local government area, the traditional owners are the Cadigal and Wangal bands of the Eora. There is no written record of the name of the language spoken and currently there are debates as whether the coastal peoples spoke a separate language \\"Eora\\" or whether this was actually a dialect of the Dharug language. Remnant bushland in places like Blackwattle Bay retain elements of traditional plant, bird and animal life, including fish and rock oysters.Anita Heiss, \\"Aboriginal People and Place\\", Barani: Indigenous History of Sydney City http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/barani ) With the invasion of the Sydney region, the Cadigal and Wangal people were decimated but there are descendants still living in Sydney today. All cities include many immigrants in their population. Aboriginal people from across the state have been attracted to suburbs such as Pyrmont, Balmain, Rozelle, Glebe and Redfern since the 1930s. Changes in government legislation in the 1960s provided freedom of movement enabling more Aboriginal people to choose to live in Sydney. Darlinghurst Ridge/Woolloomooloo Hill In the 1830s the whole area from Potts Point to Kings Cross and up to Oxford Street was known as Darlinghurst - probably named in honour of Governor Ralph Darling (1824‚Äì31)'s wife, Eliza. The rocky ridge that extended inland from Potts Point was called Eastern or Woolloomooloo Hill from the early days of white settlement. The earliest grant of land on Woolloomooloo Hill was made to Judge-Advocate John Wylde in 1822. In 1830 Wylde sold six of his 11 acres on the Point to Joseph Hyde Potts, accountant to the Bank of NSW, after whom Potts Point is named. By the late 1820s Sydney was a crowded, disorderly and unsanitary town closely settled around the Rocks and Sydney Cove, with a European population of around 12,000. Governor Darling was receiving applications from prominent Sydney citizens for better living conditions. The ridge of Woolloomooloo Hill beckoned, offering proximity to town and incomparable views from the Blue Mountains to the heads of Sydney Harbour. In 1828 Darling ordered the subdivision of Woolloomooloo Hill into suitable \\"town allotments\\" for large residences and extensive gardens. He then issued \\"deeds of grant\\" to select members of colonial society (in particular, his senior civil servants). The first 7 grants were issued in 1828, with the other allotments formally granted in 1831. The private residences that were built on the grants were required to meet Darling's so-called \\"villa conditions\\" which were possibly determined and overseen by his wife, who had architectural skills. These ensured that only one residence was built on each grant to an approved standard and design, that they were each set within a generous amount of landscaped land and that, in most cases, they faced the town. By the mid-1830s the parade of \\"white\\" villas down the spine of Woolloomooloo Hill presented a picturesque sight, and was visible from the harbour and town of Sydney.(State Library, 2002) The name of the suburb [Potts Point] honours Joseph Hyde Potts, who was employed with the Bank of New South Wales when it initially opened for business in 1817. Before the arrival of the settlers, the Point was known by a variety of names, among them Paddy's Point, Kurrajeen (or Curageen) and Yarrandabbi. The last two are Aboriginal names and \\"Paddy\\" may have been Patrick Walsh, who received a grant of 30 acres here in 1809.Graham Brooks & Associates, 2001, 14-15 Bomera and Tarana Bomera The subject site formed part of the land grant to Judge-Advocate John Wylde (after whom Wylde Street is named) in 1822, which comprised 11 acres of land at the northern end of the Point.\\".Graham Brooks & Associates, 2001, 8 William McQuade (Sr.), merchant of Windsor, first purchased land at Potts Point in June 1856. He also purchased adjacent allotments including one to the east, on which Tarana was built by 1889 and a second lot to the south in June 1857. McQuade also purchased four other sites in 1858 with the result that his land stretched along Wylde Street to Victoria Street. Early title documents refer to minor works and a boat harbour on Woolloomooloo Bay.AHC, 1978 McQuade also helped establish Randwick Racecourse.Blok, 2013 McQuade occupied and cleared the land [on which Bomera and the stables stand] in 1856 and commenced construction of Bomera the same year. The complex consisted of a two-storey building designed as a house by architect John Frederick Hilly (who lived up hill at \\"Campbell Lodge\\" and designed Carrara (now Strickland House) in that same year, Fiona (now Ascham School, Edgecliff) seven years later). Fiona and Bomera have identical front elevations and constructed in sandstone in the early Italianate style, as well as a two-storey building originally serving as a stables and a coach house, also in sandstone.HMAS Kuttabul, 1986 Tenders for construction of the stables/coach house were probably let in July 1857 and for the boundary wall, iron fence and gates in September 1857. There is no record of the date of completion of construction of stables or boundary elements, but they appear in a survey map of 1865.Graham Brooks & Associates, 2001, 15 The stables, coach house and boundary walls and fences were completed by 1865 to designs by Hilly. Bomera's builder is not known.LEP, 2005 The Australian Subscription Boat Club was built on McQuade's land at Potts Point in 1861. By 1862 McQuade had reclaimed large areas from the bay on which he erected a bathing house and pool, approached by steps, to the north of the future site of Tarana. The northern areas of the site had been developed as a garden, with the land to the west serving as a kitchen garden. The term \\"marine villa\\" was employed in the Sydney Morning Herald when sub-divided land was offered for sale in the 1860s and clearly demonstrates the importance given to the social and recreational opportunities offered by the foreshores. A gatehouse was erected in 1865 on Wylde Street. In 1867 a further grant allowed additional reclamation of foreshore areas and the construction of a new jetty in 1876. An octagonal summer house had been erected by 1875 as well as two flagpoles, an iron picket fence along the foreshore and two stone statues of dogs. In 1876 tenders were called by J.F. Hilly, for erection of a ballroom, with a timber floor, and other additions. Major modifications were made to the building and grounds, almost certainly in 1876. These included the billiards room, the large central room on the south of the building, and a second stone jetty. The works may also have included the construction of the two-storey extension at the north-west corner of the building. John Frederick Hilly has been confirmed as architect for these works. By 1884 the new foreshore areas included a tennis court. William McQuade Sr. lived on his country property \\"Fairfield\\" at Windsor, which was built for the Cox family. This survives today surrounded on two sides by a golf course. McQuade built his own private race course which is now the site of Hawkesbury Racecourse (just east of Richmond). McQuade Sr. died in 1885. He had three sons - William (Jr.), Frederick and Henry. Following the death of William McQuade in 1885 the estate was divided. Land south of Bomera went to William James Hale McQuade (the eldest son) and land to the east of Bomera to (William's son) Arthur Frederick Hale McQuade. (Arthur Frederick Hale McQuade was left money with which, Tarana was erected adjacent to Bomera by 1889 for he and his family). Henry Michael Hale McQuaid inherited Bomera. The construction of Tarana in 1889 led to the destruction of structures associated with Bomera including sheds and glasshouses. Fairfield at Windsor was left to Henry, the youngest son. The three sons studied at Cambridge and studied pipe organ under the great masters in Europe. William brought a Bryceson pipe organ back from Manchester and installed it in Bomera's ballroom, Henry brought back from England a Hunter pipe organ and installed it in Fairfield. After William Jr.'s death in 1901, Frederick transferred the organ from Bomera to the ballroom of Tarana in time to entertain the officers of \\"The Great White Fleet\\" (which visited Sydney) in 1908. Eventually this organ was sold to St Brigid's Church, Marrickville, where it remains in fine voice. Henry's Hunter organ is in St Matthew's Anglican Church, Windsor. Mrs McQuade's monument is the imposing and largest monument at the front entrance of St Matthew's Anglican Church, Windsor. In 1890 much of the south-west corner of the Bomera site was acquired by the state government. The former Boat Club, walls and steps in this area were removed in the subsequent works for new wharfage. This action followed the state government's acquisition of the whole of the Bomera property in 1910 following the McQuade's 11-year battle to force the purchase of the whole of the site. In 1917 the building was acquired by the Sydney Harbour Trust. The building was either occupied by members of the McQuade family or leased as a residence until 1902. At this time it became a boarding house, and works involving the adaptation of the building to its new use were carried out. The architects responsible for these works were Sheerin and Hennessy. In 1902 Bomera had been extended by the addition of servants rooms to the northern side of the stables building creating a wing at right angles to the original building and linking with the main house. This new wing appears to have been designed by the architectural practice of Sheerin and Hennessy. Sections of this wing were removed, when the complex was modified by the Navy, in the post-war years. From 1902 until 1941 the house was used to provide boarding accommodation. Various changes were effected during this period including partitioning and the addition of stairs and external walkways to the stables. The ballroom was converted to a dining room. In 1911 ownership was transferred to the Sydney Harbour Trust. During this period Bomera was sub-leased and physically subdivided. In 1911 the Cowper Wharf Roadway was implemented reducing the area of the gardens above the existing retaining wall, which subsequently became the southern side of Wylde Street in 1941. Extensions to Wylde Street were implemented in 1941, which until then had been a cul de sac terminating outside the Bomera stables. The new road alignment encircled Bomera and Tarana isolating them from the foreshores. In June 1941 it was acquired by the Commonwealth Government for naval use. Throughout the period of Commonwealth ownership the building with Tarana served as Sydney Naval Fleet Base Headquarters (offices), Eastern Australian Command. During the war parts of the building's interior were returned to a form basically similar to that in which they existed prior to acquisition by the Sydney Harbour Trust in 1917, except for the south-east wing and their servant's wing, which were almost totally removed. The stable building was modified to accommodate ambulances with internal and external changes to the house and its finishes to reflect operational needs. In 1955 a bust of Lord Nelson was placed in the garden north of the house. Until the 1980s the ballroom was used for court- martial hearings when most administrative functions were transferred to the new Maritime Command Centre at Garden Island. The property remains under Navy occupation. Since the war a considerable amount of partitioning and other works have again taken place, with detrimental effects to the significant fabric of the building. The building is, however, still substantially intact, and sufficient documentary evidence exists to enable works to be carried out to preserve and enhance its heritage qualities. In 2001 manufacturer-turned property developer Jorge Fernandez and his wife Monica bought Bomera and Tarana from the Department of Defence. Bomera was restored by heritage architects Graham Brooks & Associates. After two years on the real estate market, Bomera was sold to Queenslander Leanne Catelan, daughter of property mugul Ray Catelan, the entrepreneur behind real estate database RP Data. Tarana Tarana was built as a private house between 10 November 1888 and 9 December 1889, for Arthur Frederick Hale McQuade. The architect was probably Edward Harman Buchanan, and the builder John Alexander Oag. Along with Bomera Tarana was constructed for leading Sydney families at a time when the Darlinghurst-Potts Point ridge and the adjacent waterfront was the location of mansions of the affluent.LEP, 2000 It became the Ashford Ladies College between 1890/91 and 1894/95, and reverted to used as a single private residence until 1919. Major modifications to the building in 1907 by Sheerin and Hennessy included the addition of a third storey to the buildings. The ballroom extension and portico, and rebuilding of the bathing house boathouse may also have been executed at this time. In 1917 Tarana was acquired by the Sydney Harbour Trust, and during this period of ownership was subdivided into flats. In June 1941 the building was acquired by the Commonwealth. Throughout the period of Commonwealth acquisition the building served as Naval Fleet Headquarters, Eastern Australian Command. During the War the building's interior was returned to a form basically similar to that in which it existed prior to acquisition by the Sydney Harbour Trust in 1917, although the verandahs, the billiards room ceiling and the site elements were lost. Since the war a considerable amount of partitioning and other works have again taken place, with detrimental effects to the early fabric of the building. The building is nevertheless substantially intact, and sufficient documentary evidence exists to enable works to be carried out to preserve and enhance its heritage qualities. Areas of archaeological potential include the southern portions beneath the house, and the roof space. In 2001 manufacturer-turned property developer Jorge Fernandez and his wife Monica bought Bomera and Tarana from the Department of Defence. Tarana was converted to three luxurious apartments, which Fernandez subsequently sold.  Description  Bomera and Tarana are a pair of Victorian marine villas, oriented with their main facade overlooking the harbour rather than the street, on a 3700 square metre combined site. Bomera was constructed as a marine villa on the prominent headland areas of Potts Point to take advantage of the harbour views, which extended from the western elevation through 180 degrees to the eastern side, which faced towards the Heads. Marine Villas such as Bomera, and other villas erected on land fronting Sydney Harbour, differed in their orientation in that they faced towards the harbour in contrast to villas on more urban sites. Although Bomera, and its neighbour Tarana, clearly retain their orientation and limited views and some garden, physical links with the waterfront recreational areas have been severed. Tarana and Bomera occupy a site reduced in area by the impact of harbour works including the Cowper Wharf Roadway in 1911 and the formalisation of Wylde Street and the extension of Garden Island Dockyard from 1941. Bomera however, continues to make a prominent contribution to the Wylde Street frontage in association with Tarana, and to the harbour setting, and is a valuable cultural link with other mid to late nineteenth century marine villas in the Potts Point area. The latter include its neighbour Tarana, and Jenner and Elizabeth Bay House. Bomera House Bomera is a two-storey, Italianate styled marine villa located above Cowper Wharf Road, concealed at street level by the large retaining wall, but prominent from the water. It reflects the design and planning of classically influenced double pile houses erected in the first half of the nineteenth century. Such houses often featured a single storey loggia between projecting bays and an entrance vestibule wider than other circulation areas. At Bomera the loggia is expressed at ground floor level on the north side with the first floor expression of the verandah continued in cast iron. The loggia illustrates Hilly's use of large arched openings in verandahs. The vestibule is centred on the western side to provide access to the central corridor. The ground floor level is expressed externally by a rusticated base. It is a rare building type within Sydney and forms an important association with the other villas Elizabeth Bay House, Tusculum, Rockwall, Jenner House and Tarana (adjacent). It is a remnant of the marine villas that were sited relative to the water and determined the prestige residential status of the Potts Point peninsula in the nineteenth century and for its contribution to the waterscape of Potts Point. The main elevations feature three bay elements picking up the rhythm of the western breakfront with its projecting porch. Classically detailed, the porch is supported on piers flanked by stone sphinxes. The projecting bays on the north side include large three bay sash windows with narrow projecting balconies at first floor level. The central loggia/verandah space features three arched openings supported by masonry piers with pilasters and classical detailing. This classical detail is reflected in the arched detailing of the timber sash windows. The corners of the fine sandstone ashlar masonry are defined by quoins. The southern limit of the original building appears to have been defined by the central corridor. A low, partly excavated basement, accessed from the northern side of the building, was used to store perishables. Two periods of extension are apparent. In 1876 J. F. Hilly extended his original design by the addition of an upper verandah, with cast iron supports, on the northern side. On the southern side a ballroom, with curved external corners and an internal decorated cast iron gallery, was added opposite the northern verandah. The ball-room features a coffered timber ceiling and originally a glazed rooflight. The rectangular apse at the southern end held an organ. The ballroom features three bay clerestory lighting and classically detailed fireplaces in keeping with the overall Italianate idiom of the house. At the north east corner an open, two storey loggia, entered from the breakfast room, was also added. In keeping with the concept of the marine villa, rooms opening onto the verandahs and loggias feature French doors. By 1902 Bomera was extended at its eastern side in the Federation style by the addition of a servants' wing, bridging the gap between the stables and the house, and reflecting the line of the open loggia added in the 1870s. This was removed in 1941 with the exception of two rooms adjoining the house. The two storey loggia appears to have been infilled at this time. The main roof is hipped with a slate covering. The wide eaves retain the original timber soffits with supporting modillions and fascias largely intact. Later additions, including the ballroom, are roofed with a combination of slate and copper, the copper replacing an earlier lead covering. The building retains most of the original timberwork, including stairs, architraves and doors, and internal plaster finishes, including cornices, intact. Internal surface finishes have been mostly lost. The ground floor hall and stairs are in white marble with slate dividing strips. Some basement floors have been replaced in concrete. Evidence of the social functioning of the house is provided by a servants' bell in the north-east ground floor room and the suite of smaller rooms added in 1876. Grounds The grounds of Bomera occupy a prominent position at the northernmost tip of Potts Point. They were established 1856 contemporary with the residence and include mature gardens, trees and statues designed as an intrinsic part of the house and estate. Bomera is located on a 2156 square metre block. Bomera's house was designed with two directions in mind - Woolloomooloo Bay and the harbour to the north. Access from the south resulted in service areas, including stables and servants quarters, being located on the south side. Unlike later marine villas the main entrance from the carriageway was on the western side overlooking the harbour. The early Sydney roads were poor and arrival by water on the foreshore would have conferred a sense of status and the opportunity to impress by the extent of their gardens and recreational settings. The location of this main entrance to the west allowed both of these options. The original carriageway alignment remains in place with its stone edging. The two storeyed ashlar sandstone stables building remains in place at the entrance from Wylde Street. Garden elements include one of the original carved stone dogs, an 1890s iron picket fence, mature pine trees, two Californian desert fan palms (Washingtonia robusta), a Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis), grass terrace at the rear (north-western) facade, a hedge demarcating a change of level to lower terraces, a swimming pool on the lower northern terrace, stone boundary walls and a tuckeroo tree (Cupaniopsis anacardioides).Stuart Read, 26/3/2012 Sandstone bust of Lord Nelson in Bomera's garden was originally in the gardens at the Annandale Estate of Commander Robert Johnson, one of the first Australian-born officers serving in the Royal Navy. In the landscaped grounds are an eight-car garage and a three bedroom cottage. Stables It is a two storeyed ashlar sandstone building on an L-shaped plan erected in two stages. In keeping with the main house the roof is hipped with slate cladding. The building has some intact windows and joinery at first floor level, although some new door openings and windows were inserted during World War Two. The use of stone for the stables building, which also functioned as a coach house, clearly states the importance of the building as the point of entry to the site. The stables present original sandstone external wall facades featuring extant heads and sills to some windows and a hipped slate roof with original eaves including fascias, soffits and soffit mouldings. The south elevation was treated as the prime side of the stables and the crook of the east and west wings enclosed the main stables-related working area. This elevation features window heads and sills to larger first floor window, WWII opening and sill to small window, original window frames and sashes and a recycled small window frame and sash at first floor level. The Western elevation was the least important side of the stables building and was originally a totally blank and recessive facade. After successive additions and alterations during and after WWII it has reverted to its original state and now features blank original sandstone block external walls. The Northern elevation originally comprised a facade that was largely devoid of features. It generally features sandstone external walls with some original and early openings filled in during or after WWII. The doors and windows added during the 1942 works remain. Tarana Tarana is located above Cowper Wharf Road, concealed at street level by the large retaining wall, but prominent from the water. It comprises a three-storey residence of Victorian style, located on a prominent site with water views on the Potts Point peninsula. It contributes to the waterscape of Potts Point in particular its relationship to the adjacent Bomera. As with Bomera, it is rare as a marine villa within Sydney, and forms an important association with Elizabeth Bay House, Tusculum and Jenner House. It is a home in Victorian Italianate style. It includes a private entrance area, reception foyer, marble powder room. Large ballroom is now living/dining room with domed ceiling, stained glass, frescoes. The building has now been converted to three apartments in a security garden complex. The south facade has a main symmetrical three storey wing with servant wings stepped along the boundary to the east. The 1907 two storey ballroom wing protrudes forward on the west. The windows and doors are vertical with flat heads and bracketed entablatures over. The roof is slate with the 1907 chimneys intact. By contrast the north facade to the water has a three-storey verandah where the cast iron has been replaced by timber detailing. The servant and ballroom wing is set below the main roof. Two paired rooms open onto the verandah which is also accessed by a central stair. A fire stair is located adjacent to the verandah. The asymmetrical plan reflects that of the main wing with its central hall and off centre stair. The plan arrangement is intact with some original features including the timber stair, fireplaces, and vestibule arches. Tarana is a remnant of the marine villas that were sited relative to the water and determined the prestige residential status of the Potts Point peninsula in the nineteenth century. It is an important work of E. H. Buchanan and was residence for two generations of the McQuade family, an important early Australian family. The design is well resolved and particularly noted for its main wing which contains an off centre stair in the central hall, and two paired rooms opening onto the verandah. There is some archaeological potential within the house and grounds. The garden has a grass terrace at the rear (north-western) facade, with trees and shrubs to the northern side, hedges demarcating changes in level and a Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) prominentStuart Read, 26/3/12  Heritage listing  Although Bomera and Tarana are significant in their own right, a great deal of their cultural significance lies in their relationship to each other. The buildings are significant because they provide a rare example of a pair of adjacent houses constructed for two successive generations of an important Australian family. Bomera and Tarana provide good examples of the nineteenth-century houses of the Potts Point area. Their survival in relatively intact condition, when virtually all their nearby contemporaries have fallen, is quite remarkable. Together they provide a waterfront component of the former nineteenth-century waterfront houses stretching from Darling Point to Potts Point. The precinct is also important because of their joint use as Naval Fleet Headquarters, Eastern Australian Command, during and after the Second World War and for its continuing association with the Navy.Freeman 2000 Bomera & Tarana was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Bomera is the oldest remaining building at the northern end of Potts Point and one of the oldest in Potts Point. Tarana was the last house of its type constructed in the same location in the nineteenth century. Although the houses are significant in their own right, a great deal of their cultural significance lies in their precinct relationship to each other. The buildings are significant because they provide a rare example of a pair of adjacent houses constructed for successive generations of an important Australian family. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Bomera is significant as an early example of the Italianate Villa style and because its designer, John Frederick Hilly, was one of the most important Sydney architects of the nineteenth century. Tarana retains fine original joinery, fireplaces, plaster mouldings and leadlights typical of the period. Also, because it may have been designed by Edward Harman Buchanan, it is a good and rare example of his house designs. The Bomera and Tarana precinct provide an important visual focus at the extremity of the Point when viewed from the Harbour. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Bomera has considerable social significance having been built for William McQuade, a leading member of a family of importance in the social, cultural and political development of early Sydney. Tarana was built for a member of the next generation of the same family. The precinct is a rare survivor of the nineteenth century period of the Potts Point area. The precinct is also important because of the use of the houses as Naval Fleet Headquarters during and after the Second World War and for its continuing association with the Navy. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Bomera Tarana precinct (particularly Bomera) contains remnant sites of archaeological significance, relating to the former foreshore gardens and structure to the Harbour.

It is the first known extinct passerine to be described from the islands. It is the largest known member of its genus based on its skull size, and had a very robust beak reminiscent of that of a parrot. However, the remains are otherwise reminiscent of the extant but highly endangered Azores bullfinch (Pyrrhula murina). The species was described from subfossil remains found inside a lava tube in a volcano on Graciosa Island, although it may have inhabited other islands as well. The species was likely wiped out due to colonization of the islands in the 13th century by the Portuguese, which led to habitat destruction and the introduction of invasive plant species, both of which depleted the laurel forest that P. crassa likely relied on.

The company was founded in 2007 after the Turkish Government decided to implement the EU regulation on vehicle safety as defined in 96/96/EC of 20 December 1996. After a bidding process the new company won the tender for a 20 years monopoly for periodic vehicle inspections in Turkey from 2009 onwards. As required from the contract, T√úVt√ºrk did build up hundreds of new inspection stations - by 2017 it reached a point of 207 fixed and 16 mobile stations where 3500 employees are responsible for 14 million inspections annually (including the main inspections of 8 million vehicles). The shift in inspection regulations was rather sharp - in the first year, 47 percent of vehicles were not able to pass the first inspection, even though regulations had been initially eased until 2013, for example about scratches on the front wind screen as damages had been very common on the rural streets in the Anatolian hinterland. The introduction of the new inspection scheme was accompanied by an extensive propaganda campaign and through connections with the German Turks it was hoped that the population would better understand that inspections were to become much more detailed but passable, hence the naming of the company as if being a \\"T√úV\\" subsidiary.

Early life and education  Yang is from Indialantic, Florida. She became interested in environmental science from an early age when she spent time at an environmental summer camp called Earth Corps at the Brevard Community College following 5th grade. She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 2003, with a degree in Environmental Science and Public Policy. She then moved to the University of California Berkeley, where she earned her PhD in Environmental Science, Policy, and Management in 2010. For her dissertation, she worked with Whendee Silver on developing different methods to measure nitrogen (N2) production in tropical soils, for which she received a National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant.  Career and research  Yang worked as a lab and field technician at the University of California Berkeley from 2003-2004. She is currently an associate professor of Plant Biology and Geology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. She is known for her work in soil biogeochemistry and ecosystem ecology, specifically examining the way nitrogen cycles through an ecosystem and the effects that anthropogenic use of nitrogen has on ecosystems. Her current research is focused on greenhouse gas emissions and soil and the role that microorganisms in the soil, like bacteria and fungi, have in producing these gases. She received a NSF grant to pursue this work in 2018, as part of a larger collaboration with scientists from Georgia Tech and the University of Tennessee Knoxville to understand the role microbes have in nitrous oxide emissions from soil.  Publications  Yang's most notable publications include her research on more precise methods for measuring nitrogen fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems, as it is often difficult to tell the amount of N2 gas released from soil due to the concentration of N2 gas already existing abundantly in the atmosphere. Another notable publication was Yang's research on leaf litter, how climate impacts the rate of leaf decomposition and the amount of nitrogen released by decomposition.

Along with her activism, she also worked as a teacher in Freedmen's Schools in the South, and as a matron at Howard University.  Early Life  left Jacobs was born in Edenton, North Carolina in 1833, to Samuel Tredwell Sawyer (a congressman and newspaper editor) and his mistress Harriet Jacobs, at a time when Harriet was a slave under the ownership Dr. James Norcom. Louisa also had an older brother, Joseph Jacobs, born in 1829. Harriet Jacobs had been sexually harassed by Norcom for many years, but she continually refused his advances and mistakenly hoped that her relationship with Sawyer would be a deterrent to Norcom. As Harriet continued to refuse Norcom's advances, Norcom began to threaten her children in anticipation of coercing Harriet into a sexual relationship, and she became increasingly fearful for them. Harriet chose to escape when Louisa was two years old in hopes that Norcom would sell Louisa and Joseph into a safer situation. Harriet's hopes proved correct when Samuel Sawyer (the children's father) purchased the children from Norcom and sent Louisa to live with her great-grandmother Molly, then taking her to Washington, D.C. before sending her to live with a cousin in Brooklyn, New York. From Brooklyn, Harriet located Louisa and fled to Boston with her.  Career and activism   Education  While in Boston, Jacobs was educated at home and afterwards attended the Young Ladies Domestic Seminary School in Clinton, New York. She later obtained training to become a teacher in Boston, and teaching would soon become an important part of her life.  Activism  Jacobs's mother Harriet became acquainted with Amy Post and her feminist abolitionist circle while Louisa was studying in Clinton, leading to both Harriet and Louisa becoming involved in the movement. Louisa divided her time between living with the family of Zenas Brockett, a white abolitionist, and helping her mother in the Willis family home. She also spoke about women's suffrage on an American Equal Rights Association lecture tour through New York state in 1867 which included other activists such as Susan B. Anthony and Charles Lenox Remond.  Career  The Jacobs Free School In 1863, Jacobs and her mother founded Jacobs Free School, a Freedmen's School in Alexandria, Virginia, putting her teaching education to use by educating black children who had been freed from slavery. The school grew quickly, requiring a second teacher to be hired within just a few months of opening. Three years later, she moved to Savannah, Georgia with her mother and founded a new Freedmen's School, which Louisa chose to name Lincoln School. Following her teaching career Jacobs established a boarding house in Cambridge, Massachusetts with her mother, where they worked and lived side by side, with Jacobs taking on most of the responsibility in later years as she also cared for her ailing mother. Following her mother's death, Jacobs worked as matron of the National Home for the Relief of Destitute Colored Women and Children, then accepted a matron position at Howard University before retiring at 75 years of age due to a heart condition. She spent most of her remaining years with the Willis family, who had become like family during her mother's tenure with them.

Appointed to the court by Oregon Governor Tom McCall in 1976, Pihl was born in Portland, Oregon. He graduated from the University of Oregon in 1950 and obtained his law degree from Northwestern Law School in Chicago in 1954. Pihl founded his own law practice in 1955, and soon after found a love for politics that would guide his future career ambitions. In 1959, Pihl ran as a Republican for the Oregon House of Representatives, and lost to Republican nominee Vic Atiyeh, who would later go on to serve as the 32nd Governor of Oregon. In 1960, Pihl ran for District Attorney of Washington County and won, staying in that position until Governor Tom McCall appointed him to District Court Judge in 1968, and to Circuit Court Judge in 1979. Pihl served on the court in his position as Circuit Court Judge until 1995, when he elected to stay on as a Senior Judge until his retirement in 2005. Hollie Pihl (child) with his uncle Chris cutting down his first tree on his father's 1,000 acre tree-farm in Manning, Oregon.  Early life and education  Hollie Pihl was born on September 23, 1928, in Portland, Oregon and was one of six children. His father, Holger Mathew Pihl, Sr. (known to his friends as Matt Pihl), a Danish immigrant from Copenhagen, came to the United States through Ellis Island in New York City in 1906. Matt Pihl joined his brothers Chris and Pete, and obtained a job taking care of dairy cows in Dilley, Oregon. Matt Pihl purchased acreage on Green Mountain, near the town of Manning, eventually amassing nearly 1,000 acres of forestland by the time his son Hollie had been born. At this point, the Pihl family lived in St. Johns, Oregon, and used the Manning land for logging and had a small saw mill. Hollie, as a youth, learned to fall and buck, and run a chainsaw with the best of them. At the time of Hollie Pihl‚Äôs birth in 1928, his family also owned two trucking companies in Portland; Pihl Trucking (later Green Transfer Trucking, operated today as Green Transfer and Storage, and St. John's Transfer. Hollie spent many years working for his parents' trucking companies and always thought he would be a truck driver. Hollie Pihl was born with one eye pupil turned in and was the subject of much teasing when he was a student at James John Grade School, and later at Roosevelt High School. While attending Roosevelt High School, Pihl had earned enough money to finally have surgery on his eye, but when he visited the doctor, he found out it was too late to save the vision in that eye. In 1946, with little money to his name, and not nearly enough money to attend college, Hollie Pihl took advantage of the G.I. Bill and joined the United States Army during the Korean War. To pass the medical exam, which he would have failed with only one working eye, Pihl lied and said he had near perfect vision, and spent extra hours training with a firearm to perfect his shooting. He served in the Army until 1948 when he had fulfilled his time and decided he wanted to attend the University of Oregon to study law. Pihl began attending the University of Oregon in 1948 at the age of 20, and graduated four years later in 1952 after obtaining a degree from the University of Oregon. To continue to pay for his education and costs, Pihl worked for his father's trucking companies in Portland during the summers. After graduating from the University of Oregon, Pihl attended Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago, obtaining a law degree in 1955, at which point he took the Oregon Bar and began his law career in with his friend, Don Buss, in Portland, Oregon. Soon after, Pihl began to discover his ambitions to serve the United States government rather than stay in the private sector.  Legal career  Hollie Pihl began his legal career in 1955, practicing law in a firm with partner Donald A. Buss, forming Buss & Pihl. He left the firm to launch his campaign for the Oregon House of Representatives in 1962 Pihl ran as a Republican in the 1962 election, losing to fellow Republican Vic Atiyeh in the primary elections. VIc Atiyeh would go on to serve in the House of Representatives from 1959 to 1964, and in the Oregon State Senate from 1965 to 1978, eventually becoming the 32nd Governor of Oregon after defeating fellow Republican Tom McCall in the 1978 primary. After his defeat, Pihl ran for District Attorney in Washington County in 1964 and won, staying on in his position until Governor Tom McCall appointed him to District Court Judge in 1967, and to Circuit Court Judge in 1969 where he stayed on in his full-time position until he was designated a senior judge of the state by the Supreme Court, making him eligible for temporary assignment by the Supreme Court. He stayed on in this position until his retirement in 2005.  Notable cases  * State v. Koennecke (1975) * Alice Cameron (1975) * Redden v. Pihl (1977) * Frostig v.

Help from a public utility can make it easier for a homeowner to select, install or operate climate-friendly components. The utility might assist with coordinated use of utility-supplied energy, building features, financing, operating options and neighborhood supplied energy. 300x300px  Current programs  Various public utilities, related organizations and governments have started or considered programs offering home energy upgrades from public utilities.  Australia  In 2016 Greentech Media reported that Australian utilities were starting to offer home battery upgrades as a way to participate in a growing home battery storage market. Sellers of home storage batteries partnered with public utilities. By 2018 utilities were seeking a closer relationship with homeowners whose home storage batteries could help balance grid load and thus reduce the need for new conventional power plants.  China  In 2016 China implemented a Standard for Energy Consumption of Residential Buildings, a critical step to guide property developers and owners. The Rocky Mountain Institute observed that \\"no other countries with building stock volume similar to China‚Äôs had released a similar national standard\\".  Colombia   Antioquia  As explained in its 2020 website, the public utility of the Colombian city of Medell√≠n, Empresas Publicas de Medell√≠n (EPM), supported the city‚Äôs efforts to be sustainable, focusing on providing low income residents with security, opportunity, a healthy environment and healthcare. Major Medell√≠n programs have included construction of library parks, development of parks and urban green areas, development of plazas, and construction of an accessible and efficient transit system.  France  On its website in 2020, √âlectricit√© de France (EDF) affirmed its commitment to putting residential customers' energy-saving plans into practice. EDF stated that it provides smart meters and ability to monitor energy consumption from computers or smartphones. EDF‚Äôs website explains that residential customers \\"who want to invest in saving energy need look no further than EDF for precisely the right services and advice, from a home energy performance assessment to advice on heating systems (smart radiators, heat pumps, solar water heating, etc.) and the installation of energy- efficient solutions (LED lighting and heating system regulators and programmers)\\".  India  In September 2016 the Climate Policy Initiative published an analysis of challenges facing India if its national and state governments and public utilities were to help property owners install rooftop solar projects. Considered help included financing, net metering, and installation. Participating organizations would be the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, the Climate Policy Initiative, India's state governments, and state-level public electricity distribution companies.  United States  Many programs have started in the United States. U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden called attention to his climate change plan in July 2020. The Biden plan observed that ‚Äúlocal housing authorities and utility companies have stepped up and helped households invest in energy-efficient upgrades by offering flexible financing plans and tax credits‚Äù. Biden's plan included incentives for efficiency improvements, appliance electrification, and on-site clean power generation. The plan called for developing ‚Äúa package of affordable energy efficiency retrofits‚Äù and for changing building codes to increase the energy efficiency of new buildings.  Alaska  alt= In 2018, Alaska‚Äôs capital city Juneau considered easing itself away from heating oil by using heat pumps powered from hydroelectricity. The local utility, Alaska Electric Light & Power, planned the first steps toward encouraging customers to install heat pumps. Heat pump installations may be air sourced or geothermal. (Available videos describe both air source and geothermal Alt URL installations.)  California  The California Public Utilities Commission has helped builders to construct new homes that contribute as much energy to the public utilities as they extract from them. In 2018 California recognized a goal to have 100% of new homes at Zero Net Energy beginning in 2020. The Energy Upgrade California program‚Äôs 2018 website offered coordinated help for owners of existing homes. Data reported for the period from January 2016 through March 2017 indicates that residential efficiency efforts of the major California public utilities had saved enough electricity to provide electricity for about 112,000 typical US homes, and had saved enough natural gas to supply natural gas to about 53,000 typical US homes.  Colorado  The Efficiency Works program began in northern Colorado in 2014, offered by Estes Park Light & Power, Fort Collins Utilities, Longmont Power & Communications, Loveland Water and Power, and Platte River Power Authority. On its website, Efficiency Works stated that it \\"has achieved energy savings equivalent to the average energy use of 10,000 homes in our communities, and we plan to continue increasing our energy savings goals each year\\" (as of December 31, 2017). In 2018 Efficiency Works‚Äô website explained that the program assesses efficiency of a customer's home, assigns an efficiency adviser who walks the homeowner through the upgrade process from start to finish, and coordinates an energy audit. The program guides a utility‚Äôs customers, residential and commercial, in a wide range of topics including installation strategies, on-site solar generation, and battery storage. In 2017, Fort Collins Utilities identified important features and issues for Efficiency Works to succeed, including finding the best ways to invite customers to participate, assuring the quality of contractor work, and providing an assigned impartial adviser to coordinate all work for a given home. Xcel Energy, a major central states public utility, served customers in various locations throughout Colorado in 2018. Xcel's efficiency programs have helped Colorado homes upgrade appliances, lighting, and energy use monitoring - as well as Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems. Xcel's reported energy savings in 2019, due to its assistance to customers (both residential and business), indicate electricity savings sufficient to supply about 55,600 typical US homes with electricity, and natural gas savings sufficient to supply about 10,600 typical US homes with natural gas.The number of typical homes is estimated from reported energy savings after converting units of measure, with typical US home usage rates from \\"How much electricity does an American home use?\\", U.S. Energy Information Administration, October 26, 2018, for electricity, and from \\"Natural Gas Facts\\", TECO Peoples Gas, 2015, for natural gas. Electricity Savings  Connecticut  As explained on the Energize Connecticut website in 2020, Energize Connecticut has helped public utilities in the state of Connecticut to actively assist homeowners who want to save money and use clean energy. The website discusses how Energize Connecticut programs are structured. Energy professionals make improvements that lower energy bills for immediate and long term-savings. Homeowner assistance can begin with a pre-assessment via live, virtual discussions with a technician at no cost. An Energize video shows how the energy assessment process works (safety protocols are observed during COVID-19). Energize Connecticut is an initiative of the Energy Efficiency Fund, the Connecticut Green Bank, the State of Connecticut, local electric utilities and local gas utilities. The guiding board for Energize Connecticut's key funding reported that, in 2018, its residential programs saved 277,000 megawatt hours of electricity (enough electricity to supply about 26,600 typical homes in the United States) and 6,800,000 CCF of natural gas (enough natural gas to supply about 11,100 typical homes in the United States).  Florida  Florida Public Utilities (FPU) has sent energy experts to customers' homes to evaluate energy use, as described on the utility's website in 2019. During a free visit, an Energy Expert reviews a home's energy use and evaluates the energy efficiency of walls, windows, insulation, appliances, lighting and other features. The homeowner also receives help applying for rebates on high- efficiency upgrades that can add comfort and value. As a part of Chesapeake Utilities, FPU has distributed natural gas, propane and electricity in various locations in Florida.  Michigan  As mentioned on the Xcel Energy utility's 2019 website, Xcel has provided customers with energy saving assistance. In Michigan Xcel has served several communities south of Lake Superior. In 2019, Xcel's assistance programs in Michigan saved enough electricity to supply about 150 typical US homes and enough natural gas to supply about 96 typical US homes. Xcel Energy has been a part of Michigan's Efficiency United collective that has informed residential and commercial customers about energy efficiency and has offered cost-effective solutions and rebates for reducing energy use. Natural Gas Savings  Minnesota  In 2019 Xcel Energy's home and business efficiency programs in Minnesota saved enough electricity to supply electricity to about 48,300 typical US homes. These programs also saved enough natural gas to supply natural gas for about 9,530 typical US homes. Xcel offered its customers ‚Äúmore control and new options for using and managing energy‚Äù. The utility began tracking results for its efficiency assistance programs in 1992. Xcel's Minnesota Home Energy Squad, One-Stop Efficiency Shop and Partners in Energy programs received the 2019 Exemplary Program Award from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). In 2018 Xcel was acknowledged to be the first major, multi- state U.S. utility to commit to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050. In addition to serving customers within a large area of Minnesota, Xcel has provided service in Michigan, Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Texas and New Mexico. Xcel worked with Google to develop new ways for customers to manage their energy use. Customers have talked to Google Assistant to ask Xcel for energy-saving tips.  New Mexico  Xcel Energy reported its assistance to customers in eastern New Mexico saved a total of 39.4 GWh of electricity in 2019 (enough electricity to supply about 3,590 typical homes in the United States).  North Dakota  In North Dakota in 2019, Xcel Energy helped residential customers do home energy audits. Xcel served electric and natural gas customers in the Fargo, Grand Forks and Minot areas of North Dakota. The natural gas savings reported by Xcel for its business and residential assistance programs in 2019 would have been sufficient to supply about 276 typical US homes with natural gas.  Oregon  In the state of Oregon, the Energy Trust of Oregon reported in its 2019 annual report that it is overseen by the Oregon Public Utility Commission. Funded from small charges on utility bills, the Energy Trust of Oregon helped public utilities offer customers efficiency advice, contracting assistance, cash incentives and financing. In 2018 Energy Trust of Oregon programs saved enough grid supplied electricity to power about 12,100 typical US homes, and saved enough natural gas to supply about 4,900 typical US homes. The Portland General Electric (PGE) public utility distributed about one third of Oregon's electricity in 2017. In 2018 PGE announced a smart grid test bed to prepare for the utility's routine use of smart grids. A smart grid can, for example, pre-heat or pre-cool a home so that less energy is needed during a peak time. If many homes shifted energy use away from peak times, the utility would not have to build a new fossil fueled power plant just for the handful of hottest or coldest days each year. PGE's October 2018 press release stated that the test bed project \\"aims to accelerate PGE‚Äôs vision for a clean energy future through partnering with customers to decarbonize the grid\\". The test bed includes three smart grids to serve more than 20,000 customers. The test bed will make additional renewable energy sources available for a home‚Äôs use.  South Dakota  Xcel Energy‚Äôs South Dakota business and residential assistance programs in 2019 saved enough electricity to supply about 747 typical US homes with electricity. Xcel encouraged its electricity customers to be energy efficient by upgrading lighting and by shifting their use of electricity away from peak times.  Texas  In 2019, Xcel Energy offered energy efficiency guidance to its Texas business and residential customers that helped them to save enough electricity to supply about 2,130 typical US homes. Xcel served communities in the northern part of Texas, where Xcel had about 262,000 customers.  Vermont  In Vermont, starting in 2017, the Green Mountain Power (GMP) public utility helped its residential customers to install Tesla Powerwall 2.0 batteries in their homes. Using Tesla‚Äôs software platform, GMP could aggregate 2,000 Powerwall home batteries in the utility's pilot program to reduce system-wide peak load by 10 MW, which was the equivalent of removing about 7,500 homes from the grid at peak times.  Washington  Clark Public Utilities in southwestern Washington state offered many programs to help make customers‚Äô homes both energy-efficient and comfortable in 2019. Available energy counselors help homeowners explore options. In 2019 Clark offered financing to its residential customers for heat pumps, weatherization, rooftop solar, and solar water heaters. Clark's New Construction programs provide energy efficiency guidance and incentives to new home builders and to manufactured home builders, retailers and buyers.  Wisconsin  In 2019, the electricity savings reported for Xcel Energy's residential and business efficiency assistance programs in Wisconsin were enough to supply electricity for about 6,460 typical US homes. Similarly, reported natural gas savings were sufficient to supply natural gas to about 1,050 homes. Xcel cooperated with a statewide program, Focus on Energy, to offer incentives to Wisconsin residents and businesses for installing cost- effective energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Xcel served many communities in Wisconsin in 2019.  Business model  A business model, Integrated Utility Services, was described by Rocky Mountain Institute in 2014.  Economics  Rocky Mountain Institute published a revenue and cost estimate in December 2014, developed by participants from Rocky Mountain Institute, Fort Collins Utilities, Brendle Group, Colorado Clean Energy Cluster and Telluride Research Group. The estimate indicated that a public utility can offer home energy upgrades that are as profitable to the utility as the profit from conventional utility-supplied electricity and natural gas. The published analysis projected that with substantial sale of home energy upgrades, Fort Collins Utilities' total income from services to single-family homes would increase slightly, with income as a percentage of revenue rising from 8% to 12%.  Upgrades  House energy efficiency features Utilities can help homeowners to choose upgraded features in new homes, or to do green retrofits of existing homes. Examples of new home features include energy efficient orientation and thermal mass walls. Use of home Geothermal Heat Pumps (heating and/or cooling systems that transfer heat to or from the ground) can be attractive for a public utility by reducing demand for energy from the grid at peak times, enabling the utility to avoid building new power plants. Retrofit examples include sealing air leaks, installing building insulation, and replacing or repairing windows. A utility can help homeowners install solar panels, either directly at their homes or indirectly at a community solar farm.

It was built from 1855. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 June 2014.  History  The \\"Eora people\\" was the name given to the coastal Aborigines around Sydney. Central Sydney is therefore often referred to as \\"Eora Country\\". Within the City of Sydney local government area, the traditional owners are the Cadigal and Wangal bands of the Eora. With the invasion of the Sydney region, the Cadigal and Wangal people were decimated but there are descendants still living in Sydney today. 202 Victoria Street is one of a group of three terraces erected in the 1850s on the former Telford Lodge estate in Darlinghurst. In 1828 Governor Darling assigned to his senior government officials 15 exclusive villa estates on land he had subdivided from the governor's former reserve which lay immediately east of the town boundary of Sydney. This area was initially named Woolloomooloo Heights and later renamed Darlinghurst. A condition of the land grants was the building of a villa. In 1829, the deceased Colonial Treasurer's grant was reassigned to Edward Hallen (1803‚Äì80), a draughtsman to the Surveyor General. Hallen built his villa, Telford Lodge, in 1832. (The building survives in a much modified form, on Brougham Street, Potts Point). Darling's plans for the establishment of exclusive villa estates on the eastern boundary of Sydney were short-lived. Subdivision of these estates began in the early 1840s, driven by the onset of the colony's first economic downturn coupled with an increasing demand for land for housing from Sydney's rapidly growing population. Hallen was among the first of the villa landowners to subdivide his holding and sell his villa. Subdivision of the Telford Lodge estate between 1841 and 1843 created the northern end of Victoria Street which was included within the boundaries of the newly created City of Sydney in 1842. Victoria Street was aligned in 1848 and by 1854 allotments had been set out on both sides of the street. Larger lots were created at the northern end of Victoria Street, for residences with harbour views. The southern end of Victoria Street (towards William Street) was characterised by small narrow lots for workers cottages and terraces. By 1854 the allotments immediately south of No. 202 had been built on. Victoria Street was renumbered in the 1870s. From the mid 1850s until 1870 the three terraces at 198-202 Victoria Street were numbered as 204-208. The City of Sydney Rate and Valuation records indicate that Nos 204-208 Victoria Street were constructed between 1855 and 1858. They were in common ownership and are described as two storey \\"brick and shingled\\" with two rooms. The 1865 Trigonometrical Survey shows the three terraces built flush to the street with no verandah and each with an outhouse (toilet) in the rear yard. Nos. 198-202 Victoria Street are typical of the development on the small lot subdivisions that characterised the southern end of Victoria Street in the mid nineteenth century. The terraces were mainly occupied by working men and their families in a succession of tenancies until the mid twentieth century. Few tenants stayed for long periods. Until the 1890s, the majority of larger residential buildings along Victoria Street were occupied as private residences. But by the 1890s, large numbers of \\"residential\\" and boarding houses were listed along Victoria Street and surrounding streets. The demographic change was in part due to the steady move of those who could afford to into the newly developing outer suburbs. This move was promoted by improvements in public transport, which made it possible (and affordable) to travel from the suburbs into the city on a daily basis. It was also promoted by the rhetoric of social reformers. The inner city area developed an unfavourable reputation that was only reinforced by the bohemian lifestyles of some of the \\"fringe-dwellers\\", artists, writers etc. who were attracted to the area during the interwar period and the presence of American servicemen during World War II. Among the late nineteenth and early twentieth century owners of the terraces was the winemaker, Isaac Himmelhoch, who owned the terraces between 1893 and 1913. Himmelhoch was a businessman who owned a large amount of inner city property. Thomas Playfair, who owned the terraces between 1916 and 1925, was a member of a Sydney butchery and meat provedore family, who had served with distinction in World War I. In 1927 he became a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council and was influential in the establishment of the United Australia Party. In 1926 Playfair sold the five terraces to Anna Hindmarsh who retained ownership until 1958. The titles for the jointly held properties at 198-202 Victoria Street and 11-13 Earl Street were separated in 1958. Rate and Valuation Records indicate that Nos. 198 and 202 Victoria Street were, as were many of their neighbours, occupied as mixed commercial/ residential buildings at various times from the 1950s through to the 1980s. In 1958 Gregory Psaltis purchased 202 Victoria Street. He had been a tenant there since 1939 and been granted a wine and spirit license for this address in 1951 when he converted the front room for use as a storeroom for wine and cigarettes. In 1966 Psaltis sold No. 202 Victoria Street to Swiss Restaurants Pty Ltd which sold the property in 1968 to Juanita Nielsen. 202 Victoria Street and Juanita Nielsen: 1968-75 In 1968 the City of Sydney Council, then being managed by three State appointed City Commissioners, announced the preparation of a new comprehensive planning scheme. Certain key areas, such as Woolloomooloo, Potts Point and Kings Cross, were highlighted for redevelopment. Under the plans put forward, it was proposed to revitalise Kings Cross and Woolloomooloo through the demolition of old residential buildings and the construction of high density developments. Victoria Street's place in this scheme was hotly contested by residents. Also in 1968, 202 Victoria Street was sold to Juanita Joan Nielsen, journalist of Brougham Street, Potts Point who was born in 1937 and was a great-granddaughter of businessman Mark Foy. Nielsen's father bought the house for her, together with the local newspaper \\"NOW\\" which she published from 202 Victoria Street. \\"NOW\\" was originally a local issues and advertising newspaper, promoting local businesses and services and reflecting the bohemian lifestyle of Kings Cross. Initially Nielsen continued this writing style, making limited editorial comment on serious issues. Sometimes she included photographs of herself modelling the latest fashions for local stores. By mid 1973 the focus of the paper began to shift as Juanita Nielsen became involved in a number of local issues that she saw as threatening the lifestyle and harmony of the local community. One of the issues was the growing pressure by developers on the working class tenants of the terrace houses along Victoria Street to vacate their homes for demolition and redevelopment. Through 1973 and 1974 many low income tenants were forced or intimidated into leaving as the developers bought up properties. Nielsen's tenant neighbours at 204 Victoria Street were evicted to make way for demolition for the multistorey redevelopment of the site under the Parkes Development Company. Nielsen was also approached by the developers for the inclusion of her property in the development. She refused and later claimed to have been intimidated. In addition to the new focus of her newspaper, Nielsen also formed the Victoria Street Ratepayers Association and became its secretary. This enabled her to lobby the City Council against the Parkes Development and effect the delay that eventually saw the proposal lapse. Confrontation between developers and residents of Victoria Street intensified over the summer of 1973-74, often becoming violent, over the redevelopment of Victoria Point at the northern end of Victoria Street by developer Frank Theeman. Many of the tenants threatened with eviction lived in low cost rental accommodation. They organised themselves into the Victoria Street Residents Action Group to protest. In late 1973, the abduction (and later release) of one member of the Action Group, Arthur King, and the attempted eviction of one tenant, Mick Fowler, and his mother, brought matters to a head. Fowler had been away at sea when his mother was forced out. On his return from sea, and finding his mother evicted and his house boarded up, Fowler gathered members of the Seamen's Union of Australia and the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) to gain re-entry to his house, despite the developer's security guards having been placed around it. Fowler's actions were the beginnings of an ongoing and often violent campaign between residents and unions and the developers, culminating in the BLF, led by Jack Mundey, imposing a green ban on any development on Victoria Street in late 1973, which effectively halted all work on the sites. Nielsen strongly supported the fight to save Victoria Street and the impositions of Green Bans and used her newspaper to bring attention to the battle and to the violence and menace that accompanied the struggle. The battle over the demolition and redevelopment of Victoria Street in the early 1970s was by now highly politicised and generating wider public debate as one of the main campaigns in urban conservation in Sydney during this period. Victoria Street was one of the ongoing Green Ban sites being organised by the Builders Labourers Federation. Green Bans became synonymous with urban conservation in Sydney at this time, with Kelly's Bush (Hunters Hill), Glebe, The Rocks, Woolloomooloo and Victoria Street being the main sites to be eventually protected through this process. Nielsen maintained a high media profile, despite her concern with increasing threats to her safety. She joined the Woolloomooloo Residents Action Group who were fighting similar development pressures and campaigned against development in Woolloomooloo in her paper. Her concern was primarily for the tenants of low cost rental accommodation who were being pushed out of their neighbourhoods. Interviewed by the \\"Sydney Morning Herald\\" in October 1974 she was quoted as saying 'she has no time for ratbags interested in publicity or pushing some political line, but she has real concern for the little people pushed out by developers.' In early 1975 the NSW branch of the BLF was taken over by the federal branch and the Green Ban was lifted. There were allegations that the developer Frank Theeman had met with the federal BLF leader Norm Gallagher to effect the lifting of the ban. Nielsen, however, through her activism, had by then been instrumental in organising a ban by the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemens Association of Australasia (FEDA) which effectively continued the stop on development Her campaign intensified and stalled the development. In April 1975 Theeman claimed that his company was losing up to $3000 a day in costs from the stalled development and was facing financial ruin. Nielsen disappeared on 4 July 1975, following an appointment at the Carousel Club in Kings Cross to discuss advertising in \\"NOW\\". Her disappearance was widely reported in the Sydney media. Her body has never been found. A 1983 coronial inquest into Nielsen's disappearance returned an open verdict. It found that Nielsen was dead but could not say how, when or where she died. In 1994 the Commonwealth Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority investigated Nielsen's disappearance. The Committee's report noted: 'Because of her newspaper campaign, her links with a supportive union and her position as a Victoria Street property owner and ratepayer it was possible to see Nielsen in July 1975 as one of the few significant obstacles to the plans of developers. The case remains unsolved.  Description  Nos 198-202 Victoria Street, built in the late 1850s, are double storey Victorian Georgian bald-faced terraces of brick construction on sandstone footings that are built to the street alignment. The facades feature rendered brick walls in imitation ashlar. The Victoria Street terraces all have a single window and front door to the ground floor and two windows to the first floor. The windows and door feature simple drip moulds above and decorative moulded sills beneath all windows. Side gabled corrugated metal roofs with rendered brick chimneys featuring simple projecting stucco mouldings are located between No 198 and 200 and at the southern end of 202. The interior of the house has been modified over time but the original room layout is largely discernible. Significant internal fabric includes timber joinery and fireplaces.  Heritage listing  The terrace house at 202 Victoria Street, Potts Point has a high level of historical and associational significance and rarity as the residence and business premises of the conservation and community activist Juanita Nielsen from 1968 until her disappearance in 1975. The house is directly associated with Nielsen's campaign for the retention of the historic streetscapes and building stock of inner city Sydney that were threatened with demolition and redevelopment in the years prior to the enactment of NSW heritage legislation. It is also a surviving example of the streetscape she was campaigning to protect. 202 Victoria Street is the site where Nielsen published her local newspaper \\"NOW\\" through which she led her campaign from 1973 to 1975 against the overdevelopment of Victoria Street and Woolloomooloo. The battle for Victoria Street during the early 1970s was one of the main campaigns in urban conservation in Sydney during this period as well as being one of the ongoing Green Ban sites organised by the Builders Labourers Federation. Nielsen gave strong support to the Green Bans through the pages of \\"NOW\\" and Green Bans became synonymous with urban conservation in Sydney at this time. Victoria Street was one of the four main sites to be eventually protected through the Green Ban process. Nielsen was one of the high-profile campaigners of the early to mid 1970s in the often violent fight for tenants' rights and the protection of largely working class Victorian-era housing that characterised much of Kings Cross and Woolloomooloo. Her activism and newspaper editorials in \\"NOW\\" were instrumental in raising early public awareness of conservation issues in NSW, particularly the threat to heritage precincts, in the absence of statutory heritage protection. Nielsen's disappearance in July 1975, at the height of the campaign against tenant eviction and overdevelopment in Kings Cross and Woolloomooloo, and the subsequent allegations of foul play directed towards developers and their associates, further raised her profile and led to the exposure of criminal and underworld connections to development in Sydney's inner city areas. Nielsen's disappearance remains as one of Sydney's most enduring unsolved mysteries. Juanita Nielsen's House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 June 2014 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. No 202 Victoria Street has state heritage significance as the residence and business premises of the conservation and community activist, Juanita Nielsen, and the site from which she campaigned against the overdevelopment of Kings Cross and Woolloomooloo, the destruction of the historic buildings and streetscapes and the eviction of low-income tenants of these older neighbourhoods. From this house Nielsen published her local newspaper \\"NOW\\" through which she combined, from 1973‚Äì75, steadfast championship of the inner city communities of working class tenants who were being evicted for the proposed redevelopments with opposition to the demolition of the historic housing stock, in particular the Victorian-era terraces of Victoria Street. Nielsen's campaign, through the pages of \\"NOW\\", contributed to the raising of early public awareness of conservation issues in NSW in the years preceding the enactment of NSW heritage legislation and established her profile as an early heritage campaigner of the mid 1970s. Nielsen's campaign is closely aligned with the Green Ban movement of the early 1970s. Nielsen strongly supported the Green Bans imposed by the Builders Labourer's Federation (BLF) in the early 1970s to stall development at Kelly's Bush (Hunter's Hill), The Rocks, Woolloomooloo and (in 1973), Victoria Street. When the BLF lifted its Green Bans in 1975, Nielsen worked with the Federated Engine Driver's & Fireman's Association to impose bans that effectively halted demolition for the Victoria Street redevelopment. As the site from which 'NOW was published, and the centre of Nielsen's campaign, 202 Victoria Street is a symbol of the early/mid 1970s urban conservation campaign in Sydney in which Nielsen was a key player. Nielsen's activism also ensured that No 202, scheduled for demolition in 1973, has survived as an early inner city terrace. The terraces at 198-202 Victoria Street (together with the terraces at 11-13 Earl Street) have local historical significance as workers terraces constructed in the mid nineteenth century on the first subdivisions of Edward Hallen's Telford Lodge Estate.Sydney LEP 2012 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The terrace at 202 Victoria Street has state heritage significance for its especially strong association with the life and work of Juanita Nielsen, who owned and lived at the house from 1968 until her disappearance in July 1975. No 202 was also the building from which Nielsen ran and published \\"NOW\\", the local community newspaper Nielsen owned and wrote for from 1968 to 1975. Nielsen used \\"NOW\\" to spearhead her effective campaign, from 1973-5, against the eviction of low-income tenants and the demolition of the historic housing stock of Kings Cross and Woolloomooloo, in particular the Victorian- era terraces of Victoria Street, 'NOW' started as a light, local newspaper with advertorial and commercial content, but grew into a powerful tool in Nielsen's campaign against the overdevelopment of Victoria Street and Woolloomooloo; the demolition of many of the historic terraces in the area, and the eviction of the working class tenants living in them. Through her agitation and editorial comment in \\"NOW\\", Nielsen raised the profile of the struggles in inner city Sydney against large scale developers, and revealed the often brutal and violent tactics that were being used. Nielsen was a prominent campaigner and at times she worked with unions to halt development in Victoria Street. Nielsen worked with the Builders Labourers Federation (and Jack Mundey) who were simultaneously imposing Green Bans on development in The Rocks and Woolloomooloo, and later with the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, who effectively stopped demolition on contested sites. Nielsen left 202 Victoria Street on the morning of 4 July 1975 to keep an appointment and has never been seen since. Her disappearance and death remains as one of Sydney's most enduring mysteries. Subsequent inquiries linked this to the Kings Cross underworld and their operations in the development companies that were involved in the Victoria Street developments . The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. No 202 Victoria Street has local significance under this criterion. The terraces at 198-202 Victoria Street (together with the terraces at 11-13 Earl Street) have local aesthetic significance as a group of mid Victorian workers terraces, demonstrating key characteristics of the Victorian Georgian style, which contribute to the streetscapes of Victoria Street and Earl Street. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. No 202 Victoria Street has local significance under this criterion. Through its association with Juanita Nielsen and her campaign to conserve the historic housing stock and working class community of Kings Cross and Woolloomooloo, her residence and business premises at 202 Victoria Street is regarded by local community and heritage groups as a symbol of the heritage conservation of Victoria Street and of the wider inner city area. No 202 Victoria Street is marked by a National Trust memorial plaque on the footpath commemorating Nielsen, her involvement in the fight to conserve the street and her disappearance. Nielsen is also remembered with: * a white cross over an empty grave at South Head Cemetery bearing the inscription: \\"A courageous journalist who vigorously fought for the rights of others and the preservation of heritage homes through her newsletter NOW\\"; * a mural depicting the Victoria Street battles painted on one of the struts supporting the Eastern Suburbs Railway viaduct; * the annual Juanita Nielsen lecture dedicated to women activists; * the Woolloomooloo Recreation Centre opened in 1983 and named after Nielsen; * historical walking tours of the Kings Cross area that feature Juanita Nielsen. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. 202 Victoria Street is not considered to be significant under this criterion. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. 202 Victoria Street has state heritage significance as the only known building with direct and strong association with the conservation and community activist, Juanita Nielsen. Nielsen was a key figure of the mid 1970s conservation movement in the years preceding the enactment of heritage legislation in NSW for her campaign to retain the working class community and Victorian-era housing stock of the Kings Cross and Woolloomooloo areas in the face of threatened eviction, demolition and redevelopment. The five terraces at 198-202 Victoria Street and 11-13 Earl Street have local heritage significance as a rare surviving group of workers terraces within the immediate area. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. 202 Victoria Street has local heritage significance as part of a terrace group that is a representative example of Victorian Georgian style workers terraces found in the inner suburbs of Sydney.

According to a 1996 heritage survey by the City of Enfield Islington Sewage Farm was claimed to be Australia's earliest \\"water borne waste disposal treatment system\\". History In 1879 land that is now Regency Park was acquired by the City of Adelaide for the purpose of constructing the Islington Sewage Farm. The sewage farm commenced operation in 1881. In 1948, a concrete watercourse was extended to North Arm Creek (Port River) and the post-war population boom saw the sewage farm overloaded and raw sewerage diverted to the North Arm Creek. Plans for a new sewerage works for Adelaide commenced in 1960 and the treatment of sewerage was relocated to the Bolivar Waste Water Treatment Plant at Bolivar, to the north, in 1966. The Islington sewage farm was subsequently closed and the land fell into disuse. The new industrial suburb of Regency Park was created on the site. From 1975 to 1981 parts of the former sewage farm were subdivided and sold off by the state government. The former residence of the sewage farm manager, Sunnybrae Farm, was preserved and in 1981 was transferred to the City of Enfield and declared a Historic Conservation and Recreation Centre. The old farm buildings at Sunnybrae were restored by history enthusiasts in partnership with the council. The site now houses a function centre and includes a museum originally created by the local historical society. The site of the straining shed about southeast of Sunnybrae Farm near Pedder Crescent was also preserved. Sunnybrae Gepps Cross now housed at Sunnybrae Farm Butter churn on display at Sunnybrae Farm Sunnybrae Farm Complex () is a heritage-listed site in Regency Park, South Australia. The historic Sunnybrae homestead was once the official residence of the sewage farm's manager. In addition to the manager's residence, the historic complex also includes \\"Dairymen's Quarters, Cheese Room and Cellars, Stables, Cow Shed and Smoke House\\". It was only used for dairying and cheese production in 1882 to 1884, but continued to be used for depasturing stock and vegetable and fruit production irrigated by the processed sewage. In 1990 the City of Enfield gave the Enfield & Districts Historical Society the Sunnybrae property to house a museum celebrating local history. The museum was officially opened in June 1995. In 2001, the society built the Sunnybrae Farm Federation Pavilion with the assistance of a $28,000 Commonwealth grant. The society conducted open days and other public activities from 2002 to 2008. The historical society was dissolved in July 2012 and the property changed into private hands. It became known as Sunnybrae Estate, a commercially-owned function centre. Straining shed Islington Sewage Farm Straining Shed is a heritage-listed site The straining shed of the sewage farm was preserved from the 1970s land sale. As such the Islington Sewage Farm Straining Shed () was state heritage-listed in 1984 because it represents \\"part of a comprehensive waste treatment process of the late 19th century.\\" The building is also an example of how seemingly basic public infrastructure of the era was designed and built to be visually eminent and symbolic of civic pride. It is sited about southeast of Sunnybrae Farm near Pedder Crescent in view of Regency Road.

All cities include many immigrants in their population. Aboriginal people from across the state have been attracted to suburbs such as Pyrmont, Balmain, Rozelle, Glebe and Redfern since the 1930s. Changes in government legislation in the 1960s provided freedom of movement enabling more Aboriginal people to choose to live in Sydney. Darlinghurst Ridge /Woolloomooloo Hill Europeans first moved into the outskirts of the future Kings Cross from 1810, when Thomas West was granted land to build a water mill. West named his land, measuring approximately 40 acres (16.2 hectares), Barcom Glen and used his mill to supply flour to the colonial bakers and community. Although West's mill stood to the south of Kings Cross, in Darlinghurst, it was one of the first permanent European structures erected in the area. By the 1820s, West's mill had been joined by a number of windmills, built on the ridge line that extended from the South Head Road (now Oxford Street) north towards the harbour. The most prominent mills were those belonging to Thomas Barker and the one built adjacent to Thomas Mitchell's property, Craigend. This industrial development occurred in conjunction with the first grand residential vision for the area, Governor Darling's Darlinghurst. In the 1830s the whole area from Potts Point to Kings Cross and up to Oxford Street was known as Darlinghurst - probably named in honour of Governor Ralph Darling (1824‚Äì31)'s wife, Eliza. The rocky ridge that extended inland from Potts Point was called Eastern or Woolloomooloo Hill from the early days of white settlement. The earliest grant of land on Woolloomooloo Hill was made to Judge-Advocate John Wylde in 1822. In 1830 Wylde sold six of his 11 acres on the Point to Joseph Hyde Potts, accountant to the Bank of NSW, after whom Potts Point is named. By the late 1820s Sydney was a crowded, disorderly and unsanitary town closely settled around the Rocks and Sydney Cove, with a European population of around 12000. Governor Darling was receiving applications from prominent Sydney citizens for better living conditions. The ridge of Woolloomooloo Hill beckoned, offering proximity to town and incomparable views from the Blue Mountains to the heads of Sydney Harbour. In 1828 Darling ordered the subdivision of Woolloomooloo Hill into suitable \\"town allotments\\" for large residences and extensive gardens. He then issued \\"deeds of grant\\" to select members of colonial society (in particular, his senior civil servants). The first 7 grants were issued in 1828, with the other allotments formally granted in 1831. The private residences that were built on the grants were required to meet Darling's so-called \\"villa conditions\\" which were possibly determined and overseen by his wife, who had architectural skills. These ensured that only one residence was built on each grant to an approved standard and design, that they were each set within a generous amount of landscaped land and that, in most cases, they faced the town. By the mid-1830s the parade of \\"white\\" villas down the spine of Woolloomooloo Hill presented a picturesque sight, and was visible from the harbour and town of Sydney.(State Library, 2002) Of the 17 villa estates laid out by Darling on the ridge line, six fell within the area now referred to as Kings Cross: James Dowling's Brougham Lodge, Alexander Baxter's Springfield Lodge, Augustus Perry's Buona Vista, Thomas Macquoid's Goderich Lodge, Thomas Barker's Roslyn Hall estate with its windmills, and Edward Hallen's nine-acre (3.6-hectare) grant on which he did not build. The villas and properties were reached by Darlinghurst Road, running north from South Head Road. The owners were required to landscape their properties and the villas, when completed, were prominent features on the eastern skyline, although they did not necessarily represent any taming of the colonial landscape. In February 1833 a fire in the bush on Woolloomooloo Hill burnt for three nights, no doubt causing some concern among the newly installed residents. The Sydney Gazette noted that it had a most splendid appearance from a distance, commenting that \\"It seemed like an illuminated garden in which the trees were laden with innumerable brilliant lamps\\". Darling's original plan for these estates was that they would serve as an example to the wider population of what could be achieved in Sydney, and as a showcase of the growing prosperity of the colony. However, by the late 1830s the first subdivisions were being prepared. In 1837 Thomas Mitchell was first to subdivide, breaking up his Craigend Estate. Oakleigh Oakleigh stands on (part of the formerly more-than four acres of) land granted to the High Sheriff of NSW, Thomas Macquoid by Crown grant in 1839. His residence, \\"Goderich Lodge\\" was designed by architect John Verge and sited at the top of William Street, at the crossing of Darlinghurst Road and Victoria Street, where the famous \\"Coca Cola\\" billboard sign is today.Coucke, 2015 Goderich Lodge was designed by architect John Verge for Macquoid and situated near what is now the corner of Bayswater Road and Penny Lane. Born in Ireland, Macquoid came to Australia in 1829, following a period in Java, where he produced coffee crops for the East India Company, as well as a tenure as Sheriff of India. The 1832 mansion house was named after F. J. Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich, the then Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, who was also the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for a brief period. Macquoid arrived in Australia full of optimism for his new role in a new colony, but very soon had slunk into depression. His first major issue was with his new job, which he believed did not have the appropriate status for such an important position. His office was also understaffed and overwhelmed with work. Litigation and bankruptcy proceedings were rife and there were over 700 summonses to be served. To worsen things, Macquoid was also suffering financially after investing in a large farming property in the Tuggeranong Valley, near the future city of Canberra, which he named Waniassa. The country had been hit by drought, while the colony was also in financial collapse. Unable to cope, Macquoid committed suicide in October, 1841, leaving his son Thomas Hyam to deal with his mounting debts. Goderich Lodge was sold at auction two months after Macquoid's death and in the years that followed was rented by the First Bishop of Australia, Dr William Broughton, whose wife died at the house in 1849. The next tenant was Surveyor General Samuel Augustus Perry and then in the 1850s, it was purchased in 1850 by wealthy wine and beer merchant, Frederick Tooth, of Tooth and Co. Brewery. Tooth's brother Edwin lived at the other end of the Macquoid estate in the villa \\"Waratah\\". Tooth later sold it to shipping merchant Captain Charles Smith (which was when the illustration at the top of this post was created). Captain Smith died at Goderich Lodge from an embolism in June 1897 and his widow Marjorie stayed on at the home until at least 1904 when her daughter, Marjorie, married. By then, the original four-acre land grant had been subdivided and there were a number of properties on Macquoid's original estate. Goderich Lodge was demolished in 1915, the house having been located where the Hampton Court Hotel sits today (on Darlinghurst Road, west of the site of Oakleigh). The name Goderich remains in the laneway that runs along the back of the old Hampton Court Hotel, Goderich Lane. Oakleigh is a Victorian era villa dating from 1880 in Italianate style, built as a gentleman's town house, with five well- proportioned rooms and four smaller utility rooms / bathrooms over three storeys, and a belvedere or tower room. In the early 20th century the building was converted into a boarding house, with a rear \\"L\\" shaped three storey addition, comprising 12 more rooms with kitchenettes connected by a timber verandah. On a block next to the house were servants' quarters and stables, however these were demolished in the 1960s to make way for flats. Oakleigh operated for most of the 20th century as a boarding house, owned by the Boucher/Williams family who also owned properties in Kellett Street, nearby. Florimond, Beatrice and Cecelia Coucke moved into Oakleigh when they arrived from Europe in 1949 and in 1963 they bought the house. Cecelia continued living at Oakleigh with her parents, in turn her children grew up there. In the late 1970s-early 1980s Oakleigh was threatened by developers keen to demolish it and make way for a multi-storey hotel. The Coucke family successfully fought to save their home. In 1985 the Minister for Planning and the Environment, Bob Carr, placed Oakleigh under a permanent conservation order.  Description  Oakleigh is a Victorian Italianate style villa dating from c.1880, with five well-proportioned rooms and four smaller utility rooms / bathrooms over three storeys, and a belvedere or tower room. In the early 20th century the building was converted into a boarding house, with a rear \\"L\\" shaped three storey addition, comprising 12 more rooms with kitchenettes connected by a timber verandah. On a block next to the house were servants' quarters and stables, however these were demolished in the 1960s to make way for flats. Little is currently known of the original landscape (garden) plan at Oakleigh, however from the size of existing mature trees on site it is assumed the following were part of the original planting: * mature Stenocarpus sinuatus (Qld. firewheel tree), c.20m; * mature Magnolia grandiflora x 2 (Southern/evergreen magnolia), c.15m each. A mature Trachycarpus fortunei (Chinese fan/windmill /Chusan palm) c10m high, trunk girth c.30 cm may have been part of a later planting connected with the house's Federation era extension. Other remnants of the original garden include terracotta edging tiles and remnant plantings of flowering Clivia spp. (kaffir lilies). Until the early 1980s a mature (3m tall) tree fern (Cyathea sp.) grew next to the front gate.  Heritage listing  Oakleigh was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

By the mid-1830s the parade of \\"white\\" villas down the spine of Woolloomooloo Hill presented a picturesque sight, and was visible from the harbour and town of Sydney.(State Library, 2002) 55 Victoria Street 55 Victoria Street was constructed in the 1870s on a site that formed part of a parcel of land that was granted by Governor Ralph Darling to John Busby in 1831. John Busby, surveyor and civil engineer was one of the 13 nominees for grants on Woolloomooloo Hill. Each agreed to build a substantial building to a design that would be approved by the Governor within three years of the grant. As a result, the area, which had not been allocated previously for agricultural activities due to its barren and rocky nature, became established with large villas by the mid 1830s. Busby's land extended from \\"Woloomoloo Bay\\" to \\"Woloomoloo Road\\" (later renamed Woolloomooloo and Macleay Street respectively). Busby's neighbours included judges Sir James Stephen and John Stephen, and Ambrose Hallen, the Colonial Architect. It was Hallen who was responsible for the plan that established Victoria and Brougham Streets with the permission of Busby and his influential neighbours, whose villas stood mainly on the ridge overlooking the proposed new streets and the emerging city beyond. The creation of Victoria Street effectively subdivided the early land grants and created a series of smaller land parcels, which were later subdivided in an ongoing pattern that has resulted in the dense development of the area today. However, back in the 1850s the area contained only grand villas on large estates. In the 1870s when number 55 was constructed on a steep, narrow parcel of land extending from Victoria Street to Brougham Street the area to the north was still largely covered with gardens and bush. Indeed, the area was described at the time as the \\"Regent's Park of Sydney\\". The suburban development of Woolloomooloo began at the head of the bay where the low tidal flats allowed for the construction of wharves and warehouse on reclaimed land. When the three-storey terrace was built at 55 Victoria Street the area to the north was occupied by the large estates with mature gardens. The areas of the south was developing rapidly with large houses and terraces on smaller parcels of land. A large terrace was built around 1860 on the site immediately south of Number 55 and it is this large building that identifies the site of Number 55 prior to its own construction. The McElhone steps were not built until about 1990. Immediately prior to the construction of 55 Victoria Street the suburbs of Woolloomooloo and Darlinghurst were densely developed around the wharves at the southern end of the bay. In contrast very little development had occurred to the north on Woolloomooloo Hill and Potts Point where the large estates still dominated the landscape. The property originally formed part of a grant of more than 8 acres to John Busby. In 834 the title passed to Semphill, Ryder, Semphill (again), Little and to Charles Elouis on 1 February 1875. Between this date and 1982, when Elouis applied to bring the title under the provisions of the Real Property Act, the three- storey terrace was constructed. The construction date was probably around 1877. The earliest view of the terrace at 55 Victoria Street, Potts Point is a view taken from the Domain about 1882. It shows the building in its current built form. It appears light (almost white) in tone adjacent to other buildings and objects. The McElhone Steps do not appear in the view. The building still appeared light in colour early in the twentieth century following construct of the McElhone Steps. Charles Elouis lived at the place and others are recorded in the Sands Street Directory also living at this address. Elouis might have lived elsewhere from 1880 to 1896. Charles Elouis was the ratepayer from 1877 until 1880 and from 1896 until 1906. After his death his wife Alice, whom he married from 1913. The place as it was during Charles and Alice's last years together shows in the background of a photo of an early cottage that stood on the adjacent site. It shows 55 Victoria Street still as a light coloured building by comparison with the surrounding features. However, by 1931 it had taken on the ubiquitous stone tones of most of Sydney's terrace. Also by 1931 the adjoining tall sewerage ventilation stack had been built. It shows in an aerial photograph by Sydney's prominent photographer, Hall. The rate books indicate that in 1931 the Catholic Women's Association occupied the place. Alice Elouis was still alive but living at Waratah. The place had become a hostel at that time and 1932 it became a boarding house known as Rosmoyne Flats. In 1935 the title was transferred to John Peza. It appears that he continued the use and that the subsequent owners Hamilton (1949‚Äì51) and Blok (1951‚Äì70) occupied and managed the place as a boarding house and flats. In 1970 Victoria Point Pty Ltd acquired it for redevelopment. The site then became associated with one of Sydney's most protracted and notorious development disputes involving passionate battles over the rights of tenants and the future of the city fringe. It entered the city's folklore when journalist and activist Juanita Nielsen, who had been a leader of the anti-development campaign, disappeared and was never seen again. The National Trust of Australia (NSW) was drawn into the dispute and was compelled by force of public opinion to list the place of the National Trust Register as part of a classified precinct. The National Trust records from 1971 contain details of the events that occurred after 1970. When the NSW Heritage Council was formed in 1977 it had the power to provide permanent protection by way of conservation orders. A permanent conservation order over 55 Victoria Street was gazetted in September 1981. Plans for redevelopment of the site were lodged with Sydney City Council in 1971 but the work did not commence until 1981. Prior to 1970 the building remained largely intact in its authentic form. However between 1970 and 1981, when the so-called restoration works commenced, the place was vandalised and some of the authentic detailing was destroyed. Further losses occurred when verandas, windows and external doors were then reconstructed in modern materials to details that do not accord with the original design The rear (west side) verandas and end screens were removed and not replaced. A modern colour scheme was introduced. Research undertaken in 2001 revealed that the building was painted in a cream brown colour scheme in the early 1980s and in a cream and green scheme, similar to the current scheme but with lashings of gold paint on trim elements, in about 1990. The current scheme is plain.Ellsmore 2002  Description  55 Victoria Street, Potts Point is a three-storey terrace that stands beside the McElhone Steps at the northern end of Victoria Street.

Early life and pre-escape  Anna Maria Weems was born in Maryland in 1840 to John, a freeman, and Arabella Talbot Weems, an enslaved woman. As a result of her mother being enslaved, Weems and her siblings were automatically considered to be the slaves of Adam Robb, who owned Arabella. Robb died when Weems was about seven years old and his slaves were divided between his two daughters, Jane Robb Beall, and Catherine Robb Harding. Upon learning that the family was to be separated, Weems's parents worked closely with abolitionists to create the Weems Ransom Fund to purchase their freedom, but were only able to do so for Arabella and one of Weems's siblings before Weems was sold to Caroline and Charles M. Price. Weems had three brothers that were also sold, but to another plantation owner. The Prices were made several offers for the now fifteen-year-old Weems, one of which was for $700, but continuously refused, making it necessary for Weems to escape if she wanted to join her family.  Escape  In order to escape Weems sought assistance from lawyer J. Bigelow, who had helped with the earlier purchase of freedom for Arabella and one of her children. Escape was difficult, as the Prices made Weems sleep beside them at night in an attempt to hinder any attempts to flee to freedom. Weems planned her escape for two years, eventually making her escape on Thanksgiving of 1855. Aware that notices about her escape would likely be looking for a woman, Bigelow organized an plan where Weems would be disguised as \\"Mr. Joe Wright\\", a male carriage driver, to offset her description that was placed on her wanted ad. She would then pick up her \\"conductor\\" on the Underground Railroad, William 'Mr H.' Still, from the White House, where he had business, and travel with him to his house in Philadelphia. After arriving in Philadelphia, Still then took her to New York where she stayed with Reverend A. N. Freeman and his family, who would then take Weems to Canada via coach, where her aunt and uncle had built a life with other slave fugitives. Her parents would later make their way to Canada as well, where they were reunited with Weems after seven years of separation.  Free life and death  There is little information about Anna's post-slavery life, other than her escape to Buxton, Canada where her aunt and uncle had escaped to as slaves. Eventually her mother and sibling made their way there too. The last sign of Anna is from 1863. She had signed a baptism record as the baby's godmother. The date of her death is unknown. There is no tombstone or known descendants.  Significance  Historians such as Stanley Harrold have stated that the importance of gender is significant to the case of Weems, as her disguise is what allowed her escape to be successful. He also argues that this case also \\"suggests that a number of aspects of the underground railroad remain worthy of investigation\\" such as the international and interracial cooperation between abolitionists and that this would help historians understand why all persons involved continued to help regardless of the potential consequences of being caught.

Previously trading under the name of Lafarge Wapco Plc, the merger of Lafarge and Holcim and resulting consolidation of Lafarge's assets in Nigeria and South Africa resulted in the name change to Lafarge Africa. It is one of Nigeria's leading cement manufacturer and was second in terms of volume produced in 2017. In 2010, the firm formally launched a ready-mix division. In 2016, the firm's capacity was 14.1 million tonnes of cement, 5 million metric tonnes of aggregates and 3.5 million tonnes of ready-mix concrete. The company manufactures and distributes products through its associated divisions that include WAPCO, United Cement Company of Nigeria, Calabar, Ashaka Cement, Lafarge South Africa and Atlas Cement Company. Company's brand products include Ashaka branded Portland limestone cement produced in Gombe State, Elephant and Superset cement produced by WAPCO, UniCem, Readymix Concrete, building aggregates, and Lafarge South African products such as artevia decorative concrete products, Buildcrete and DuraBuild cement, Dura-Pozz, Fast-Cast, Pozz-Fill, Powercrete Plus and SuperPozz.  History   Lafarge WAPCO  West African Portland Cement company began operations in 1961 at Ewekoro, the firm was formally established in 1959 as a joint venture between Blue Circle, United Africa Company of Nigeria and the Western regional government in Nigeria. Blue Circle, previously known as Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers was Nigeria's largest supplier of cement. But not to be lose the market to local producers especially after a Nigerian Cement Company was commissioned at Nkalagu, Eastern Nigeria, Blue Circle joined a consortium that included the Western Nigeria government to establish a new kiln at Ewekoro. The consortium adopted a capital intensive dry process of cement production and produced Elephant brand of Portland cement. In 1978, a new plant was opened at Shagamu that was eventually producing one million tonnes in 2003. When productivity of the aged plant at Ewekoro began to decline, the firm built a new plant and adopted the wet process method of producing cement, that facility was commissioned in 2003 with a capacity to produce 1.32 million tonnes. By 2004, WAPCO had become the largest cement producer in Nigeria. In 2001, Lafarge of France acquired Blue Circle, including the latter's interest in WAPCO. Seven years later, the name became Lafarge Cement WAPCO plc. Lafarge increased production at WAPCO in 2011 with the commissioning of an additional 2.2 million metric tonnes plant at Lakatabu, Ogun State. Along with the new plant, the firm built a power plant to fire the new kilns.  Lafarge Africa  In 2014, Lafarge and Holcim merged and decided to consolidate some of their African businesses. A new entity Lafarge Africa was announced in June 2015, the company merged WAPCO of Nigeria's assets with the South African assets of Lafarge. In 2017, Lafarge welded together more holdings in Nigeria when Atlas Cement, Port Harcourt and UNICEM of Calabar were merged with Lafarge Africa. The company sold its stake in Lafarge South Africa to Caricement in mid 2019.

It was built from 1831 to 1837 to the design of John Verge for successful businessman Alexander Brodie Spark. It was then let to influential cleric William Broughton, the first and only Anglican Bishop of Australia and later inaugural Bishop of Sydney, from 1836 to 1851. It is owned today by the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  History of the area In the 1830s the whole area from Potts Point to Kings Cross and up to Oxford Street was known as Darlinghurst- probably named in honour of Governor Ralph Darling (1824‚Äì31)'s wife, Eliza. The rocky ridge that extended inland from Potts Point was called Eastern or Woolloomooloo Hill from the early days of white settlement. The earliest grant of land on Woolloomooloo Hill was made to Judge-Advocate John Wylde in 1822. In 1830 Wylde sold six of his 11 acres on the Point to Joseph Hyde Potts, accountant to the Bank of New South Wales, after whom Potts Point is named. By the late 1820s Sydney was a crowded, disorderly and unsanitary town closely settled around the Rocks and Sydney Cove, with a European population of around 12000. Governor Darling was receiving applications from prominent Sydney citizens for better living conditions. The ridge of Woolloomooloo Hill beckoned, offering proximity to town and incomparable views from the Blue Mountains to the heads of Sydney Harbour. In 1828 Darling ordered the subdivision of Woolloomooloo Hill into suitable \\"town allotments\\" for large residences and extensive gardens. He then issued \\"deeds of grant\\" to select members of colonial society (in particular, his senior civil servants). The first seven grants were issued in 1828, with the other allotments formally granted in 1831. The private residences that were built on the grants were required to meet Darling's so-called \\"villa conditions\\" which were possibly determined and overseen by his wife, who had architectural skills. These ensured that only one residence was built on each grant to an approved standard and design, that they were each set within a generous amount of landscaped land and that, in most cases, they faced the town. By the mid-1830s the parade of \\"white\\" villas down the spine of Woolloomooloo Hill presented a picturesque sight, and was visible from the harbour and town of Sydney. History of Tusculum Ownership by Alexander Brodie Spark Tusculum was named by its original owner, Alexander Brodie Spark (1792-1856), after a town in the Alban Hills, 10 kilometres south-east of Rome where wealthy Romans built luxurious villas - that of Cicero being especially famous. The name of Spark's other property, \\"Tempe House\\" also has classical origins. The building of the house signified Spark's rise to good fortune during the 1820s. He arrived in Sydney as a free settler in 1823. His success in shipping and commerce meant that he was quickly accepted as an influential member of colonial society. Spark had received a literary education, which may account for the naming of his villa. His 1828 grant of over 9 acres was one of the few original grants made to a private citizen. John Verge's plan for Tusculum was approved by Governor Darling in 1830. Spark probably built it as an investment property, as he only lived there for a brief period. The villa was under construction from 1831-5.State Library, 2002 His failure to occupy it symbolised Spark's financial decline, the collapse of the Bank of Australia and the depression of the 1840s. Spark sent a plan of his proposed house to the Colonial Secretary on 1 June 1830, explaining that the plan had been prepared for some time, but that he had wanted to make it more \\"ornamental\\". This is 10 months prior to the first reference to Spark's house in John Verge's ledger. It is possible that Spark may have had the earlier plan prepared independently, and engaged Verge to assist in making it \\"more ornamental\\". John Verge's ledger records details of the commission from \\"Plans\\" in 1831 to \\"Details for Pilasters front door of\\" shortly before completion in 1836. Bishop William Broughton as a tenant Alterations were made in 1836 to suit its first tenant, Bishop William Broughton. The Broughtons made Tusculum a centre of hospitality and, after Government House, it was the most important domestic building in the colony. The Broughton papers contain several references to the unfinished state of the house when he moved in during 1836, and the alterations and improvements he undertook 'to bring the premises into a state of decency.' In Broughton's early years at Tusculum a garden was established - there are references to a kitchen garden, rose trees from England etc. In 1839 he had shelves put up for his library so that his books could be \\"released from captivity, and placed in security from damp and dust\\". An interesting letter from Emily Crawley (n√©e Broughton) to Phoebe Boydell, dated 22 September 1850, describes the accommodation arrangements at Tusculum for the Conference of Australasian Bishops held in October that year. Bishop Broughton lived at Tusculum from 1836 to 1851 - for almost the full length of his episcopacy. He appears to have been occasionally unsettled by his accommodation, with numerous references in his letters to his desire to relocate. Broughton had difficulty in obtaining suitable alternative accommodation, and became resigned to the circumstances of Tusculum. Broughton took out another lease on the property for seven years in 1848 at ¬£300 p.a. (letter to Coleridge, 16 February 1848) - 'lt is a sad, imperfect place and anything but episcopal in pretensions: but it is in a cheerful situation and good air, and answers my purposes tolerably well.' By 1843 there was a serious financial crisis in the colony, and the Darlinghurst grantees suffered. They pressed for the freedom to subdivide their land, and Sydney's first exclusive suburb opened up to investors. From the early 1850s, the Gold Rush boosted the economy, and interest in the land available at Darlinghurst grew. The first subdivisions occurred around the edges of the original grants, with blocks of a size that allowed other grand houses to be built and new streets formed. In the 1870s, heavy land taxes imposed by the administration of the Premier, Sir Henry Parkes, led to another wave of subdivisions of the original grants. The late 19th century saw the final demise of the grounds surrounding the original villas, and in some cases, the villas themselves. Broughton was no longer living at Tusculum in 1851, the year prior to his departure. Tusculum was then purchased by William Long.Clive Lucas & Partners P/L, 8-9 Ownership by William Long The authorship of the substantial alterations undertaken at Tusculum for William Long is not certain. It is likely that John F. Hilly may have been the architect. Hilly did a lot of work in the Potts Point, Darlinghurst and Woolloomooloo areas and owned a local quarry. The cast iron balustrade design on the verandahs at Tusculum is very similar to those at Fiona, Edgecliff (1864), Guntawang (1869‚Äì70) and the Prince of Wales Theatre (1863) all works of Hilly. Ownership, 1904 to 1983 Tusculum was auctioned on 21 October 1904. Lewis Edward Isaacs bid ¬£3,750 for Lot 1 which included the house. Isaacs engaged the architect, John Burcham Clamp to undertake extensive alterations to the staircase and stair hall and a tender was let to Mr. John White. Tusculum was purchased by Orwell and Alfred Phillips in 1906. Orwell later purchased his brother's share in the property. It is likely that Burcham Clamp was also responsible for the Billiard Room addition. He did other work for the Phillips family (such as a house at Moss Vale, 1915). In the 1920s and 1930s, the original villas and the later grand 19th century residences were demolished to make way for blocks of flats, hotels and later, soaring towers of units. Today only 5 of the original 17 villas still stand, with the lost villas and other grand houses commemorated in the names of the streets of Potts Point, Darlinghurst and Kings Cross. Following its use as a serviceman's club during World War II and a private nursing home, the building fell into disrepair and was the subject of a compulsory resumption in 1983, being the first under the provisions of the (then) recently gazetted NSW Heritage Act 1977. Lease by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects Subsequently, the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (NSW Chapter) leased Tusculum for 99 years, on the condition that it will be responsible as custodian for the restoration and maintenance of the building and for making it available for public enjoyment. In addition, the NSW Government sold the freehold of the back section of the Tusculum site to the RAIA and the Heritage Council gave permission for a new building to be constructed adjoining the villa. The new building, which was the subject of a national competition, won by the architectural firm Levine & Durbach, houses the RAIA and subsidiary organisations, a 143-seat auditorium, and offices. The restored villa is used for meeting rooms, a gallery and for receptions. The two buildings operate as one complex, a combination of restored nineteenth century heritage and quality 1980s architecture. Clive Lucas, OBE, FRAIA, a prominent conservation architect and the leading authority on John Verge was commissioned by the RAIA to undertake the conservation work. The restoration is intended to evoke the early to mid Victorian period and was completed in 1987 in accordance with the \\"Draft Conservation Policy\\" in Reference 1. Both buildings were officially opened by the Premier of NSW on 11 March 1988.Press release RAIA  Description  Tusculum is a large two storey Colonial Regency mansion designed by John Verge, built 1831-35. Constructed from stuccoed brickwork it is surrounded on three sides by a fine Classical two storey verandah of the Ionic order, probably built sometime in the 1870s. Cedar of interiors imported from Lebanon; marble for flooring and chimney pieces imported from Tusculum in Italy. High shuttered French doors open on the broad verandahs. Original low pitched slate roof is now covered with tiles. (Australian Heritage Commission, Register of the National Estate). Tusculum is one of the few remaining Regency houses remaining in Sydney. It is one of the few colonial houses to display the attributes of a villa with basement offices and stair. It was reported to be in very good condition as at 12 January 2005. It retains significant components of the original Verge design, with overlays of other periods particularly 1870s verandah rework and internal stair modifications dating to Edwardian times. Accretions removed in 1980s conservation work include fire- damage.  Heritage listing  The principal cultural significance of Tusculum is its use as a residence by William Grant Broughton, first Bishop of Australia from 1836 to 1847, (1847-1852, Bishop of Sydney), during almost the entire period of his episcopacy. After Government House, it assumed the status of the most important domestic building in the colony. Designed by the prominent architect, John Verge for entrepreneur A.B. Spark, it was one of the first villas to be erected on Woolloomooloo Hill, as part of an elaborate attempt by the Colonial Government to establish a prestigious enclave for the gentry in the 1830s. It has very strong historical and architectural associations with its contemporary neighbour Rockwall, also designed by Verge. This pair are among a handful of colonial villas to have survived. Apart from Bishop Broughton, the house is associated with many other prominent Sydney figures including Spark, a colonial merchant whose rapid rise and decline with the collapse of the Bank of Australia mirrored the depression of the 1840s. The house signified the rise to respectability of the emancipist and former publican, William Long and his son William Alexander Long (responsible for major alterations and additions in the 1860s), It was associated with the politician the Hon Henry Edward Kater; the prominent lawyer Sir James Martin, the Lord Mayor of Sydney Sir William Manning and Orwell Phillips. It is one of the few colonial houses in Sydney to display the attributes of a villa, with basement work areas and stair, demonstrating the \\"upstairs/downstairs\\" nature of domestic administration, typical of nineteenth century English houses. It is an excellent example of the transformation of a Regency villa of high architectural quality into a mid-Victorian Italianate mansion.Clive Lucas & Partners, 1985, 48 Tusculum was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Designed by the famous architect John Verge, Tusculum is one of the finest Regency mansions in Sydney remaining from the early Colonial period. It was built between 1831-35 for wealthy merchant A B Spark but its first occupant was Bishop Broughton, first Bishop of Australia. The building retains important historical associations with many famous people of the early Colonial era. Together with its neighbour \\"Rockwall\\", also by John Verge, Tusculum was one of the first villas built on Woolloomooloo Hill as part of the Colonial Government's attempt to establish a prestigious enclave for the gentry in the 1830s. It retains strong historical and architectural associations with Rockwall, one of the few other colonial villas to have survived.Clive Lucas & Partners, pp49-49 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. A building of elegant detail and proportion, Tusculum retains strong associations with Rockwall, as two related works by the one architect in the same locale. Tusculum is one of the few colonial houses to display the attributes of a villa, with basement service rooms and stair. It is an excellent example of the transformation of a Regency villa of high architectural quality into a mid-Victorian Italianate mansion.Clive Lucas & Partners, pp48-49 The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. During its occupation by Bishop Broughton, it assumed the status of the most important domestic building in the colony, after Government House. As a social document, Tusculum demonstrates the \\"upstairs / downstairs\\" nature of domestic administration, typical of nineteenth century English houses. In its association with A B Spark, it symbolises a rise in his fortune in the 1820s, financial decline with the collapse of the Bank of Australia, through to the depression of the 1840s. It is the principal physical manifestation of the life of the emancipist William Long and his family whose occupation, alterations and substantial additions indicate his rise to fortune social acceptance as a merchant. Tusculum was one of a few buildings to achieve recognition in the early twentieth century as a residence of significance reflecting a growing maturity. Its resumption by the New South Wales Government was the first instance of the application of the provisions of the NSW Heritage Act, 1977 and indicates awareness and acceptance of the principles of heritage conservation. In the custody of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects NSW Chapter, Tusculum has been restored to evoke the early to mid-Victorian period. It is accessible to the public through public openings and through its use as a conference and meeting venue in association with the activities of the RAIA. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site offers potential to explore the construction techniques and materials of Colonial Sydney and of later periods and as an example for comparative analysis of a rare villa design. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. One of a handful of colonial villas and a rare surviving work of John Verge, a prominent architect of colonial times.

In 1830 Wylde sold six of his 11 acres on the Point to Joseph Hyde Potts, accountant to the Bank of NSW, after whom Potts Point is named. By the late 1820s Sydney was a crowded, disorderly and unsanitary town closely settled around the Rocks and Sydney Cove, with a European population of around 12000. Governor Darling was receiving applications from prominent Sydney citizens for better living conditions. The ridge of Woolloomooloo Hill beckoned, offering proximity to town and incomparable views from the Blue Mountains to the heads of Sydney Harbour. In 1828 Darling ordered the subdivision of Woolloomooloo Hill into suitable \\"town allotments\\" for large residences and extensive gardens. He then issued \\"deeds of grant\\" to select members of colonial society (in particular, his senior civil servants). The first 7 grants were issued in 1828, with the other allotments formally granted in 1831. The private residences that were built on the grants were required to meet Darling's so-called \\"villa conditions\\" which were possibly determined and overseen by his wife, who had architectural skills. These ensured that only one residence was built on each grant to an approved standard and design, that they were each set within a generous amount of landscaped land and that, in most cases, they faced the town. By the mid-1830s the parade of \\"white\\" villas down the spine of Woolloomooloo Hill presented a picturesque sight, and was visible from the harbour and town of Sydney.State Library of New South Wales, 2002 Rockwall John Busby (1765-1857) was a mineral surveyor and civil engineer. In 1823 he was appointed to manage the colony's coal mines and to find a new supply of fresh water, as the Tank Stream had become too polluted. Busby became famous for overseeing construction of \\"Busby's Bore\\" a tunnel which brought fresh water from the Lachlan Swamps (in today's Centennial Park) into the city when the Tank Stream, the city's original water supply, became polluted and inadequate to serve the city's water needs. Busby received a grant of over 8 acres in 1828. Architect John Verge started plans for Busby's house, Rockwall, and a cottage in 1830. Verge's plans for the house were approved by the Governor the same year.State Library, 2002 However, in the early 1830s Busby found himself in financial difficulties, and was forced to sell his grant. From 1835, Verge altered the existing plans for the new owner of Rockwall, Hamilton Collins Sempill, a grazier and merchant. Verge supervised the works for Sempill through to completion in 1837. A 1840 painting (artist unknown: Sempill House, Sydney, NSW, State Library) shows it with extensive gardens including a carriage loop, shrubberies and Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria excelsa). One of the earliest surviving Verge-designed buildings, Rockwall is amongst the few surviving of the once many villas which once dotted Potts Point's \\"Woolloomooloo Hill\\". In the 1920s and 1930s, the original villas and the later grand 19th century residences were demolished to make way for blocks of flats, hotels and later, soaring towers of units. Today only 5 of the original 17 villas still stand, with the lost villas and other grand houses commemorated in the names of the streets of Potts Point, Darlinghurst and Kings Cross. Rockwall is one of these surviving five villas. According to Verge's ledger, work was commenced on Rockwall prior to 1835. Sempill bought the property in January 1835. Sempill entered into an arrangement with Verge for 'Plans, Specifications and Agreements for altering and completing (the) house at Wooloomooloo (sic late Busby's) and Superintending Works of the same'. Stabling was also to be designed and constructed on the property. By the time of Sempill's ownership - as depicted in a contemporary watercolour - Rockwall's grounds boasted a circular driveway facing Macleay Street which was balanced on the Sydney (western) side by a circular drive and garden featuring, among other exotic plantings, Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla). In Sydney, these trees had become a symbol of vice-regal residences and of harbourside villas and private pleasure grounds. The grounds surrounding Rockwall re-emphasised its strong axis from the front to the back door and thus its design as a villa \\"in the round\\". Moreover, in obeying fashionable domain, and external offices for stables and domestic economy'; its respectable distance from the growing town of Sydney; and its pleasurable recreational and even, perhaps, instructive environment, Rockwall was one of the first examples in a long tradition of colonial villa architecture (and landscape design) which reflected changing taste in England during the 1820s.Howard Tanner & Associates, 1988, 15-16 1836 saw the house pass into the hands of Thomas Urmson Ryder who, it is noted in Verge's ledger, ordered plans and specifications for verandahs for Rockwall and of a garden house for the property. Alterations, additions and repairs \\"in the completion of (the) premises\\" were also recorded in Verge's ledger. Heralding the boom in subdivision and sales which was to transform Woolloomooloo Hill in the 1840s, Ryder put Rockwall up for public auction on one half of the original estate on 14 December 1837: the other portion was sold off as \\"Thirty allotments of Garden and Building Ground\\", two of which had a cottage on them (one with a detached stable) and another a four-stalled stable of stone and brick.Howard Tanner & Associates, 1988, 16 Rockwall sold at auction in 1837 to Arthur Little whose daughter occupied it until 1872.Howard Tanner & Associates, 1988, 17 By 1843 there was a serious financial crisis in the colony and the Darlinghurst grantees suffered. They pressed for the freedom to subdivide land, and Sydney's first exclusive suburb opened up to investors. From the early 1850s, the Gold Rush boosted the economy, and interest in the land available at Darlinghurst grew. The first subdivisions occurred around the edges of the original grants, with blocks of a size that allowed other grand houses to be built and new streets formed. In the 1870s, heavy land taxes imposed by the administration of the Premier, Sir Henry Parkes, led to another wave of subdivisions of the original grants. The late 19th century saw the final demise of the grounds surrounding the original villas, and in some cases, the villas themselves. Rockwall was used as a girls' school, Belmore College ( 1873-1884) and again as the Ailanthus College for Girls (1904‚Äì13). It then returned to use as a private residence. Dr. Herbert Russell Nolan, an ear nose and throat specialist who performed the first appendicectomy in Australia,THE FIRST APPENDICECTOMY IN AUSTRALIA WAS PERFORMED AT TOOWOOMBA IN THE COLONY OF QUEENSLAND Retrieved 5 April 2020. purchased the house it in 1914. He commissioned architect William Hardy Wilson in conjunction with the Sydney architects Neave and Berry to prepare an elaborate proposal for Rockwall around 1919-20 but Sydney City Council development application records indicate it was not acted upon. Subsequent additions and alterations were to destroy or bury many of the house's original qualities. The first documented alterations were done for Ivy M. Corke in 1921. Extensive alterations and additions were made by 1924-5, 1928 and 1936 by the Nurses' Club Ltd., a body which owned Rockwall from 1925-1957. In 1957 it was converted into the Rockwall Private Hotel and major renovations that year saw construction of a new foyer, replacement en masse of the windows and doors, removal of cedar joinery and fireplaces. Further additions were made in 1960. Rockwall later became part of the Chevron Hotel, then the Landmark Hotel. By the 1960s it was virtually derelict, but was restored in the 1990s for the adjoining hotel (now Rockwall Apartments). Rockwall was finally classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) on 14 December 1979, 142 years after Ryder put it and its subdivided grounds up for auction. It was made the subject of a permanent conservation order on the same day. Though dilapidated and long-deprived of its subdivided gardenesque setting, it stands as a most significant example of both the pre-Victorian colonial villa and of the translation of European taste into the Antipodes. Its fortunes reflect the process of urbanisation in Sydney and the impact of this process on a specific part of the city's material culture. Rockwall and a portion of the surrounding land were restored in 1995 by Howard Tanner & Associates for the Mirvac Group as part of the development of the adjacent Landmark Parkroyal Hotel (now the Rockwall Apartments) in Macleay Street and today is privately owned.NSW State Library, 2002 Rockwall was bought by antique enthusiast Lilian Barclay and retired lawyer John Rollason in 1999 for $2m.Sydney Morning Herald, 31/1-1/2/2014, 7 The couple married at the house on 26 April 2008, although its title remained in Barclay's name only. Mining tycoon Stephen Turner, a non-executive director of Iluka Resources Ltd., the world's largest producer of zircon, and wife Phi Phi bought the property in May 2014 for an undisclosed $10.2m, the suburb's third-highest house price. Rockwall is one of the few remaining original grand residences of Potts Point.  Description  House Architect John Verge started plans for Busby's house, Rockwall and a cottage in 1830. Verge's plans for the house were approved by the Governor the same year. Built 1831-37 as a two-storey Colonial Regency style villa/town house in sandstone blocks with cedar fittings and joinery throughout. From 1835, Verge altered the existing plans for the new owner, Sempill. Verge supervised the works for Sempill through to completion in 1837. Italianate verandahs were added later (LEP). Stuccoed brick construction of five bays with encircling verandah at ground floor, broken by Doric columned porches on the east and west sides. The house is Regency in character. Built 1831-37 to the designs of Verge with later additions on the south and east side. The oval geometric hall and staircase are similar to Elizabeth Bay House, on a smaller scale. The house today has at least four bedrooms and four bathrooms. Extensive entertaining areas inside and out, including elegant sitting room and grand dining room, both with original marble fireplaces. Lower area with own entrance is a series of sandstone block rooms, with servants' kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, wine cellar and \\"dungeon\\". Rumous persist of an underground passage or escape tunnel. Double garage with parking on the grounds also.Blacket & Glasgow real estate agents, advertisement, Wentworth Courier, 3/3/11 Grounds The original grant in 1828 was over . The gardens once extended to Macleay Street. A painting shows it with extensive gardens including a carriage loop, shrubberies and Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria excelsa). Darling's so-called \\"villa conditions\\" which were possibly determined and overseen by his wife Eliza, who had architectural skills. These ensured that only one residence was built on each grant to an approved standard and design, that they were each set within a generous amount of landscaped land and that, in most cases, they faced the town. Despite subdivision and encroachment, particularly by two high rise buildings on its immediate eastern and south-eastern boundary, and nearby School complex to its north-west and other terrace housing to its south-west, Rockwall remains amongst the few surviving of the many villas which once dotted Potts Point. The property now is 1349 square metres of level land, landscaped with manicured gardens including trees along the northern Rockwall Crescent boundary, a lawn to the house's western side, another large Chinese elm tree to the south-west towards Challis Avenue. Rockwall Crescent is a quiet cul-de- sac today.The Sydney Morning Herald, 31 January-1 February 2014.  Heritage listing  Rockwall was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. It was considered to be of historical and aesthetic significance and also rare as one of the few surviving early villas of Potts Point, as a fine example of the work of John Verge, architect, and due to association with John Busby of \\"Busby's Bore\\" fame.

History   Aboriginal history  The \\"Eora people\\" was the name given to the coastal Aboriginal people around Sydney. Central Sydney is therefore often referred to as \\"Eora Country\\". Within the City of Sydney local government area, the traditional owners are the Cadigal and Wangal bands of the Eora. There is no written record of the name of the language spoken and currently there are debates as whether the coastal peoples spoke a separate language \\"Eora\\" or whether this was actually a dialect of the Dharug language. Remnant bushland in places like Blackwattle Bay retain elements of traditional plant, bird and animal life, including fish and rock oysters.Anita Heiss, \\"Aboriginal People and Place\\", Barani: Indigenous History of Sydney City http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/barani ) With the invasion of the Sydney region, the Cadigal and Wangal people were decimated but there are descendants still living in Sydney today. All cities include many immigrants in their population. Aboriginal people from across the state have been attracted to suburbs such as Pyrmont, Balmain, Rozelle, Glebe and Redfern since the 1930s. Changes in government legislation in the 1960s provided freedom of movement enabling more Aboriginal people to choose to live in Sydney.  Darlinghurst Ridge/Woolloomooloo Hill  In the 1830s the whole area from Potts Point to Kings Cross and up to Oxford Street was known as Darlinghurst ‚Äì probably named in honour of Governor Ralph Darling (1824‚Äì31)'s wife, Eliza. The rocky ridge that extended inland from Potts Point was called Eastern or Woolloomooloo Hill from the early days of white settlement. The earliest grant of land on Woolloomooloo Hill was made to Judge-Advocate John Wylde in 1822. In 1830 Wylde sold six of his on the Point to Joseph Hyde Potts, accountant to the Bank of New South Wales, after whom Potts Point is named.

By the mid-1830s the parade of \\"white\\" villas down the spine of Woolloomooloo Hill presented a picturesque sight, and was visible from the harbour and town of Sydney.(State Library, 2002)  Jenner House  The site was created in the 1866 subdivision of Alexander Macleay's 55 acre Elizabeth Bay estate. A 99-year lease of the lot was taken out by retailer Lebbeus Hordern who commissioned colonial architect Edmund Blacket to design a two-storey house named Stramshall (with outbuildings) in 1871. The house was erected in 1871 in Regency Revival style, the ground and first floors and service wing. In 1875 the lease was transferred to J. T. Neale, and two years later in 1876-77 a third storey was added to a design by Thomas Rowe. The name was changed to Kurragheen, then later Lugano. In 1915 the building became the Jenner Private Hospital, and several minor alterations were made to facilitate this use. The garage in the south western corner of the site was erected in the 1920s during the hospital period of usage of the site. The hospital saw many patients over the decades; former Sydney mayor and state MP Sir Matthew Harris died there in 1917 and serving federal MP James Sharpe died there in 1935, while Premier of South Australia Richard Layton Butler was treated there when he fell ill on a visit to Sydney in 1929. In 1940 the site was acquired by the Commonwealth as part of a larger resumption of properties in Potts Point for the construction of the Captain Cook Graving Dock, and much of the foreshore garden was subsequently destroyed. The hospital use continued until 1952 when the Royal Australian Navy took control of the building. In 1966 the remaining outbuildings were demolished. The building was used for a succession of naval purposes until March 1998 when it was vacated in preparation for its disposal. The property was sold in 1998 to horse breeder Tony Peterson. A conservation management plan for the property was prepared in 2000 and Jenner was listed on the NSW State Heritage Register in 2001. Jenner was sold in 2009 to former car dealer Terry Mullens and his wife Wendy. The Mullens' completed a three-year restoration before advertising the property for sale in June 2014.SMH Title Deeds, 9-10/1/10  Description   House  Jenner House is a grand 19th century marine villa designed by Edmund Blacket (1871) and Thomas Rowe (third floor, 1877). It has interesting internal detailing by Blacket and his then employee J. Horbury Hunt. The house has three levels plus a partial basement, a single storey detached 1920s garage in the south western corner of the site and remnant walls of former outbuildings in the north western part of the site. It has essentially 8 bedrooms, six bathrooms. It has polished timber floors, a huge multiple room cellar, high ceilings, solid sandstone foundation and capacious interiors.Wentworth Courier, 2009 The building represents the transition in architectural taste which took place in the second half of the 19th century with the lower two floors on the western facade exhibiting the Regency style, and elsewhere the more flamboyant asymmetrical characteristics of the 19th century Italianate villa.  Grounds  Jenner House has a frontage to Macleay Street and originally had a harbour frontage which was acquired for the construction of the Garden Island Dockyard in 1940. There are remnant walls of former outbuildings in the north-western part of the site. Adjoining development consists of eight and nine storey residential flat development. The site also has a relationship with other 19th century marine villas of Bomera and Tarana to its north-west and Elizabeth Bay House to its south-east. The precinct is also potentially important in terms of historical archaeology both in the building fabric and remnant formal garden settings.Conservation Management Plan, 2001 Jenner appears to be the only remaining garden of the once numerous fashionable 19th century villas on Potts Point, as well as a fine example of a boldly designed late 19th century suburban garden.National Trust, 1981 Gardens flank both sides of the house - on its west facing Macleay Street a forecourt front entry garden is dominated by a carriage loop and central lawn and fountain as its focus. A large evergreen magnolia/bull bay (M.grandiflora) is a feature of this garden. A single garage is located on one side of this forecourt. To the east is a lower rear garden, also marked by a circular lawn (and former gravel walk), edged by a significant sandstone wall above a sandstone outcropping overlooking the adjacent Navy base. The top garden is broadly a sweep of lawn, inside a large circular shape and outside it flanked by shrubberies, with a view of Sydney Harbour and heads across it from the house.Wentworth Courier, amended by Stuart Read, 24/9/9 A landscape assessment undertaken in 2006 identified a number of significant landscape features as follows: *Magnolia grandiflora at front of Jenner; *Line of Camellia sp.to the rear of property; *Remnant Macleay Street perimeter wall; *Semi-circular sandstone wall at the rear of garden; *Sandstone escarpment adjacent to sandstone wall; and *Sandstone flagging along southeast of site.  Modifications and dates  * 1875: subdivision of Alexander Macleay's Elizabeth Bay Estate * 1880-90: upper grassed terrace had a planting of shrubs around its periphery suggesting a circular grass shape within the terrace and defined on the periphery by a gravel path with an outer ring of sandstone edging and an inner band of low hedging with mass planted bed edged with terracotta tile edgings. Main paths leading from the central house steps curved to south and north, both with sandstone edging and later paved with bricks laid diagonally. * 1915+: adaptation for private hospital use and residential use. * 1920s-30s: three Magnolia trees located along southern boundary of Macleay Street entrance forecourt. Only one survives today. One close to Macleay Street may have been removed in the hospital era to construct a garage structure. * 1940s: major portion of original eastern garden demolished when property resumed to allow construction of Garden Island Naval Dockyard complex. Eastern slopes demolished except for immediate sandstone ledge below the semi-circular stone retaining wall. Pathways leading around to stone-cut and concrete steps either side of the grassed terrace were terminated in a cut-stone overhang. The southern steps led to a circuitous path negotiating the broken landform of the foreshore slopes. The northern steps terminated in a brick-walled and corrugated iron gabled roof garden structure. The northern access appears to have been built in the Federation era (1880-1919) whilst the southern steps originally gave access to the garden house in the Late Victorian Period. * 1941: The grassed terrace of the upper eastern garden was modified to accommodate a rectangular building presumably of wartime Naval use. The top pool/terrace has been significantly altered, especially with the construction of a building that was demolished between 1945 and 1952.  Heritage listing  The Jenner precinct demonstrates the lifestyle of the late 19th century residents of the Potts Point area, which was characterised by the beauty of its houses and grounds and the wealth of its residents. The north wing represents a rare and valuable example of the status of the house servants. The precinct is also significant because of its 40-year period as a private hospital and for its extensive association with the Navy and with the operations of Garden Island, one of the largest engineering undertakings in 20th century Australia. Jenner (1871) represents a fine example of the domestic work of Edmund Blacket with interesting internal detailing by Blacket and his then employee Horbury Hunt. The building's second floor was the work of Thomas Rowe in 1877. The building represents the transition in architectural taste which took place in the second half of the 19th century with the lower two floors on the western facade exhibiting the Regency style, and elsewhere the more flamboyant asymmetrical characteristics of the 19th century Italianate villa. The building also has a relationship with other 19th century marine villas of Bomera and Tarana and Elizabeth Bay House. The precinct is also potentially important in terms of historical archaeology both in the building fabric and remnant formal garden settings. Jenner appears to be the only remaining garden of the once numerous fashionable 19th century villas on Pott's Point, as well as a fine example of a boldly designed late 19th century suburban garden. Jenner House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The play follows a young orphan, Mary, who is persuaded by her uncle and religious hermit, Abraham, and his co-hermit, Effrem, to lead a life of complete chastity and devotion to God. When Mary submits to temptation and loses her virginity, she flees her religious life to become a prostitute. Years later, when Abraham comes to her disguised as a lover, Mary returns to her life of devotion and submits to a strict regimen of penance.Hrotsvitha. The Plays of Hrotswitha of Gandersheim. Edited by Robert Chipok. Translated by Larissa Bonfante, Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, Inc., 2013. Hrotsvit's play is considered a story about the divine forgiveness and the power of Mary's redemption.  Characters  * Abraham - a hermit * Effrem - a hermit * Mary - Abraham's niece * A Friend of Abraham * The Master of an Inn  Summary  Scene 1  In the desert near Lampsacus, Abraham approaches his co-hermit, Effrem, outside of his cell and asks for a moment to talk. Effrem assures Abraham that as long as their talk is in praise of God, he is at Abraham's service. Abraham seeks Effrem's advice about what to do with his eight-year niece, whom Abraham has recently received custody of after the death of her parents. Abraham reveals that he loves the young orphan immensely and is worried about conserving her purity. Her name, Mary, compels him to initiate her into a monastic noviciate, and he asks Effrem for support in leading her down this path. Effrem obliges, and the two hermits set off to see her.  Scene 2  In Abraham's cell, Abraham and Effrem talk to Mary. Abraham asks Mary if she is willing to live a life of chastity in order to follow in the footsteps of her namesake Mary, the first of all virgins. Effrem notes the mystical significance of her name, persuading the young child that her place is alongside Mother of God in Heaven. After commenting that she sees nothing mystical in her name, Effrem explains that 'Mary' stands for 'Stella Maris', meaning the star around which the world revolves. It is called 'Stella Maris' because it never sets and provides constant guidance for sailors steering their course. Mary wonders how she, \\"a poor frail creature made from the dust of the earth\\" live up to such a name. Effrem declares that she can do so by keeping remaining a virgin. If she does so, he asserts, she will be freed of her earthly body and eventually arrive in Mary's bridal chamber, in the arms of her Son. Excited by Effrem's rhetoric, Mary exclaims that she will deny herself in order to be worthy of those heavenly blessings. Effrem and Abraham are elated about her concession but decide that Abraham should build a little cell close to him from which he can watch her and guide her.  Scene 3  Four years later, Abraham returns to Effrem's cell will bad news. Overcome with sorrow, he announces that Mary has run away. He tells Effrem that a man dressed as a monk made visits to the girl and seduced her. After having sex with the man, Mary become overwhelmed with remorse. Feeling unable to redeem herself, she chose to abandon her monastic commitment. Effrem is shocked by the news and wonders how Mary had been able to escape without Abraham noticing. Abraham discloses that two days before Mary's disappearance, he had a nightmare in which a massive snake dashed outside his cell and grabbed a little white dove that was by his side. The snake devoured the dove and vanished. Thinking that his dream indicated a threat to the Church, he prayed to God for two days, asking Him to reveal the dream's meaning. In a second dream, the snake fell dead at his feet, and the dove reappeared unharmed. When he woke from this dream. Abraham realized that he had not heard Mary's usual singing for the past two days. He rushed to her cell, and found she had disappeared. Eventually, some people came by and informed him that Mary had \\"given herself up to the lusts of the world.\\" No one knows where she has gone, but Abraham tells Effrem of his plan to enlist a friend who travels often. Abraham has asked this man to find her. When Abraham learns of her whereabouts, he will go to her disguised as a lover, in order to convert her back to her godly life. Effrem accepts this plan but asks what Abraham will do if he has meat or wine put before him while charging in the secular world. Abraham asserts that he must not refuse the meat or wine, so he will remain undetected. Condoning this, Effrem claims that in order to win back a soul for Christ, it is alright to stray from religious asceticism.  Scene 4  Two years later, a man dressed as a soldier approaches Abraham at his cell. Realizing the man is his friend who he had sent to look for Mary, Abraham readily greets him. Abraham's friend tells of Mary's occupancy at a house of \\"ill-fame\\" where she receives many lovers. The brothel is owned by a man who pays her well. Aghast at the news, Abraham demands a horse and an officer's uniform and hat. The friend gives him his disguise, and Abraham decides to take some gold so he can pay the master of Mary's house.  Scene 5  In the town of Assos, Abraham approaches the inn where Mary resides. The Master of the Inn greets Abraham, and Abraham asks for a place to stay. Once Abraham has received the man's hospitality, he asks see the young girl about whom he has heard great things. The man praises Mary's youth, telling Abraham that she \\"outshines all the other women.\\"  Scene 6  In a room at the inn, the Master of the Inn brings Mary to Abraham. In an aside to the audience, Abraham calls on his personal strength to be able to see her \\"decked out in the guise of a harlot.\\" He must preserve his disguise and not show his true feelings about her. When he sees her, Abraham asks Mary to give him a kiss. When she embraces Abraham, she recognizes Abraham's scent, but cannot place it. Mary begins crying, telling the audience \\"How far have I fallen, and into what a sink of iniquity!' When the Master of the Inn asks her why she cries, she exclaims that she wishes she had died before she fell into this disgraceful way of life. Abraham consoles the girl, and the three sit down for supper. When they have finished their meal, Mary tells Abraham to go to bed, where she will visit him.  Scene 7  When Mary and Abraham enter a bedroom at the inn, Abraham tells Mary to lock the door so that no one can come in. When Abraham takes off his disguise, Mary reveals her angelic life is lost. He asks her why she deserted him without telling him of her fall from grace. He and Effrem would have done penance on her behalf. Mary says that she could not bear to approach him in her defiled state. Abraham explains that human nature is to sin, and it is not the man who sins who deserves condemnation, but the man who fails to rise up from the sin. Hearing this, Mary falls at Abraham's feet. She stares at the ground, unable to look at him. Believing that she does not deserve pardon, Abraham reasons with her to drop her despair and accept his guidance. Mary submits herself to his wishes. She says that she will walk behind him in his footsteps back to his cell, but Abraham demands that she will ride on his horse to protect her feet. Mary vows to devote herself to God.  Scene 8  Mary and Abraham arrive at Abraham's cell. When Abraham points out her empty cell, she is terrified of going in and facing her sin. Agreeing that Mary should avoid the place where \\"the Enemy has triumphed,\\" Abraham tells her to occupy a different cell where the Serpent will not find her. He tells her that he will go to visit Effrem and tell him news of her return.  Scene 9  Outside Effrem's cell, Abraham tells Effrem that he has brought Mary back. Abraham tells his co-hermit that Mary has surrendered to her strict penance. She has put on a hair vest and is continuously fasting so that her body can bow to the will of her soul. The two men rejoice in the forgiveness of God. The lift their hands to God, and praise Him for His mercy.  Hrotsvit  Hrotsvit, also known as Hrotswitha, was a tenth-century Saxon canoness. She came from an aristocratic background and settled at Gandersheim, where she had access to the abbey's extensive library.Sperberg-McQueen, M.R. ‚ÄúWhose Body Is It? Chaste Strategies and the Reinforcement of Patriarchy in Three Plays by Hrotswitha Von Gandersheim.‚Äù Women in German Yearbook, vol. 8, 1992, pp. 47‚Äì71. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/20688759. During her time at Gandersheim, Hrosvit wrote six plays influenced by Roman comic playwright, Terence.Newlands, Carole E. ‚ÄúHrotswitha's Debt to Terence.‚Äù Transactions of the American Philological Association, vol. 116, 1986, pp. 369‚Äì391. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/283926. In the preface to her plays, Hrosvit addresses this influence: \\"I...have not hesitated to imitate in my writings a poet [Terence] whose works are so widely read, in order to glorify, within the limits of my poor talent, the admirable chastity of Christian virgins in the same form which has been used to describe the shameless charms of sinful women.\\" Hrostvit's project, therefore, was to write plays that redeem women from the moral depravity of Terence's work and to put forth an alternative narrative in which women are spiritually steadfast and courageous. In accordance with this mission, Hrosvit's heroines overcome obstacles in the preservation of their Christian virtue. That virtue usually takes the form of virginity ‚Äì a central motif in Abraham.  Feminist reception and criticism  Abraham, along with Hrotsvit's other five plays, has been the object of much feminist criticism. Scholars have disagreed about whether the play empowers women or reinforces oppressive systems. In her book Feminism and Theatre, Sue- Ellen Case writes of Hrotsvit's popularity among pioneers of the suffrage movement.Case, Sue-Ellen. Feminism and Theatre. Routledge, 2016. British suffragettes such as Edith Craig mounted Hrotsvit's plays and embraced the female playwright as a protofeminist hero. Contemporary critics have written nuanced assessments of Hrotsvit's story of Mary's fall and redemption. Stephen L. Wailes frames Abraham as a \\"contest of flesh and spirit...waged around Maria,\\" in his essay, Beyond Virginity: Flesh and Spirit in the Plays of Hrotsvit of Gandersheim.Stephen L. Wailes. ‚ÄúBeyond Virginity: Flesh and Spirit in the Plays of Hrotsvit of Gandersheim.‚Äù Speculum, vol. 76, no. 1, 2001, pp. 1‚Äì27. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2903704. He argues that although the play deals with Mary's virginity, the central trial of Abraham is not her loss of virginity, but her power to overcome disgrace and despair through penance. Because Mary fell from grace, she is able to restore her faith with new strength and significance, ultimately bringing that power to others. M.R. Sperberg-McQueen takes a more skeptical look at the feminist implications of Abraham. In Whose Body is it? Chaste Strategies and the Reinforcement of Patriarchy in Three Plays by Hrotswitha von Gandersheim, Sperberg-McQueen argues that Mary's identity and agency are stripped from her throughout Abraham. The suppression begins when Abraham and Effrem force their interpretation of the name, Mary, onto the young orphan. By conflating her with the Virgin Mary, Abraham and Effrem are setting Mary up for failure, impossibly demanding that the mortal little girl should live her life as a divine figure. In insisting that Mary eventually become the bride of Christ, Abraham deepens his male bond with God at Mary's expense. Sperberg-McQueen also suggests that Abraham was the perpetrator of Mary's seduction and that Mary was the victim of incest by Abraham. Despite her devotion to God, Mary's burgeoning womanhood becomes a mark of difference and temptation for Abraham. Overcome with the shame of this incest, Mary is compelled to escape. Only through an excruciating regimen of penance can Mary afford to live alongside Abraham again. By abusing her female body, Mary no longer becomes an object of temptation for Abraham. Regula Meyer Evitt also posits that Abraham committed incest in her essay, Incest Disguised: Ottonian Influence at Gandersheim and Hrotsvit's \\"Abraham\\".Evitt, Regula Meyer. ‚ÄúIncest Disguised: Ottonian Influence at Gandersheim and Hrotsvit's ‚ÄòAbraham.‚Äô‚Äù Comparative Drama, vol. 41, no. 3, 2007, pp. 349‚Äì369. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/23238659. She notes that the circumstances surrounding Mary's loss of virginity are decidedly ambiguous. Not only is Abraham's role in Mary's loss of virginity dubious, but his disguise as a lover later in the play is also exploitative. When disguised as a lover, Abraham pursues Mary's kisses. Evitt suggests proposes that with Abraham's disguise, Hrotsvit is \\"demonstrating how male incestuous desire can present itself in disguise.\\" In this way, Hrotsvit may be offering a subversive commentary on male desire and spiritual corruption in Abraham.

It states that the number of seats that should be allocated to a given party should be between the upper or lower roundings (called upper and lower quotas) of its fractional proportional share (called natural quota).Michael J. Caulfield. \\"Apportioning Representatives in the United States Congress - The Quota Rule\\". MAA Publications. Retrieved October 22, 2018 As an example, if a party deserves 10.56 seats out of 15, the quota rule states that when the seats are allotted, the party may get 10 or 11 seats, but not lower or higher. Many common election methods, such as all highest averages methods, violate the quota rule. Mathematics If P is the population of the party, T is the total population, and S is the number of available seats, then the natural quota for that party (the number of seats the party would ideally get) is : \\\\frac P T \\\\cdot S The lower quota is then the natural quota rounded down to the nearest integer while the upper quota is the natural quota rounded up. The quota rule states that the only two allocations that a party can receive should be either the lower or upper quota. If at any time an allocation gives a party a greater or lesser number of seats than the upper or lower quota, that allocation (and by extension, the method used to allocate it) is said to be in violation of the quota rule. Another way to state this is to say that a given method only satisfies the quota rule if each party's allocation differs from its natural quota by less than one, where each party's allocation is an integer value.Alan Stein. Apportionment Methods Retrieved December 9, 2018 Example If there are 5 available seats in the council of a club with 300 members, and party A has 106 members, then the natural quota for party A is \\\\frac {106} {300} \\\\cdot 5 \\\\approx 1.8. The lower quota for party A is 1, because 1.8 rounded down equal 1. The upper quota, 1.8 rounded up, is 2. Therefore, the quota rule states that the only two allocations allowed for party A are 1 or 2 seats on the council. If there is a second party, B, that has 137 members, then the quota rule states that party B gets \\\\frac {137} {300} \\\\cdot 5 \\\\approx 2.3, rounded up and down equals either 2 or 3 seats. Finally, a party C with the remaining 57 members of the club has a natural quota of \\\\frac {57} {300} \\\\cdot 5 \\\\approx 0.95, which means its allocated seats should be either 0 or 1. In all cases, the method for actually allocating the seats determines whether an allocation violates the quota rule, which in this case would mean giving party A any seats other than 1 or 2, giving party B any other than 2 or 3, or giving party C any other than 0 or 1 seat. Relation to apportionment paradoxes The Balinski‚ÄìYoung theorem proved in 1980 that if an apportionment method satisfies the quota rule, it must fail to satisfy some apportionment paradox.Beth-Allyn Osikiewicz, Ph.D. Impossibilities of Apportionment Retrieved October 23, 2018. For instance, although Hamilton's method satisfies the quota rule, it violates the Alabama paradox and the population paradox.Warren D. Smith. (2007).Apportionment and rounding schemes Retrieved October 23, 2018 The theorem itself is broken up into several different proofs that cover a wide number of circumstances.M.L. Balinski and H.P. Young. (1980). \\"The Theory of Apportionment\\". Retrieved October 23 2018 Specifically, there are two main statements that apply to the quota rule: *Any method that follows the quota rule must fail the population paradox. *Any method that is free of both the Alabama paradox and the population paradox must necessarily fail the quota rule for some circumstances. Use in apportionment methods Different methods for allocating seats may or may not satisfy the quota rule. While many methods do violate the quota rule, it is sometimes preferable to violate the rule very rarely than to violate some other apportionment paradox; some sophisticated methods violate the rule so rarely that it has not ever happened in a real apportionment, while some methods that never violate the quota rule violate other paradoxes in much more serious fashions. Hamilton's method does satisfy the quota rule. The method works by proportioning seats equally until a fractional value is reached; the surplus seats are then given to the state with the largest fractional parts until there are no more surplus seats. Because it is impossible to give more than one surplus seat to a state, every state will always get either its lower or upper quota.Hilary Freeman. \\"Apportionment\\".

A Democrat, she is the member of the United States House of Representatives from . The district, which was once represented by former President George H. W. Bush, includes much of western Houston.  Early life and education  Fletcher was born at Hermann Hospital in Houston on February 13, 1975. Fletcher was raised in the River Oaks neighborhood of Houston, later graduating from St. John's School. She left Texas to attend Kenyon College in Ohio, where she earned Phi Beta Kappa honors, and then attended William & Mary Law School in Virginia. She then returned to Houston, where she worked for the law firm Vinson & Elkins. Later, she worked at Ahmad, Zavitsanos, Anaipakos, Alavi & Mensing, where she handled complex business litigation cases, becoming their first female law partner in 2015.  U.S. House of Representatives   Elections  In the 2018 elections, Fletcher ran for the United States House of Representatives in . She defeated Laura Moser in the Democratic Party primary election after a primary and runoff election that saw Democrats sharply divided between Fletcher (backed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) and Moser (backed by Bernie Sanders's group Our Revolution.) In the November 6 general election, Fletcher campaigned as a moderate against nine-term Republican incumbent John Culberson, ultimately defeating him by five percentage points (52.5% versus 47.5% of all votes.) Culberson held his own in his longstanding base of west Houston, parts of which he had represented for three decades at the state and federal levels, as well as in the Memorial area. However, Fletcher out-performed him in the district's share of southwest Houston, as well as the Bear Creek area. Upon her swearing-in on January 3, 2019; Fletcher became the first Democrat to represent the district since its creation in 1967, and is the first woman to represent the district. Her victory ended a 52-year hold on the district by the GOP. Bush, the district's first representative, was succeeded by House Ways and Means Committee chairman Bill Archer in 1971. Archer handed the seat to Culberson in 2001. As a measure of how Republican this district has historically been, Fletcher is only the fourth Democrat to garner even 40 percent of the vote in the district.

During this time, the French commander Marshal Auguste de Marmont led a 40,000-man French army in an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the garrison. An Allied failure to bring sufficient artillery ammunition caused the siege to be prolonged. The garrison repulsed a premature British attempt to storm the fortified convents on 23 June, but finally surrendered four days later after an artillery bombardment breached one fort and set another one on fire. During his maneuvering, Marmont formed the idea that Wellington was only willing to act on the defensive. This mistaken notion would contribute to Marmont's defeat at the Battle of Salamanca a month later. Background Strategic situation On 20 January 1812, the Anglo-Portuguese army commanded by Wellington successfully concluded the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo. This was followed by the Siege of Badajoz which ended on 6 April 1812 when Wellington's army stormed and captured that city. With these two victories, the strategic initiative in the Iberian Peninsula passed from the French to the Allies under Wellington. At the same time, the Emperor Napoleon lost interest in Spain as he turned his energies to his planned French invasion of Russia. He ordered 27,000 Imperial Guards and Polish units withdrawn from Spain, weakening the French occupation forces. Napoleon ordered that his brother King Joseph Bonaparte and Joseph's chief of staff Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan assume the overall command of the French armies in Spain. In reality, Marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet in eastern Spain, Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult in Andalusia, and Marshal Marmont in western Spain would continue to act as independent commanders. Also, the French army in northern Spain was never placed under Joseph's orders. In May 1812, there were 230,000 French troops in Spain, but half of these were occupying forces in northeast Spain and unavailable for field operations against Wellington. Wellington decided to take 48,000 troops and move against Marmont's Army of Portugal. Meanwhile, Lieutenant General Rowland Hill with 18,000 Anglo- Portuguese soldiers would watch Badajoz. To keep Marmont from being reinforced, Wellington arranged for Spanish forces under Major General Francisco Ballesteros to harass Soult's forces in the south and for British Admiral Home Riggs Popham to conduct raids on the northern coast of Spain. Marmont's army counted 52,000 soldiers, but only 35,000 were immediately available for field operations and these were dispersed in order to obtain food. One of his divisions was stationed in Asturias and could not be used without Napoleon's permission. Joseph and Jourdan had 18,000 men around Madrid but 6,000 of these were unreliable pro-French Spanish troops. Joseph ordered Marmont and Soult to cooperate in the event of an Allied offensive, but Soult absolutely refused. Operations On 13 June, Wellington's army crossed the Rio √Ågueda near Ciudad Rodrigo in three columns on a front wide. The advance continued steadily over the next three days. The right wing consisted of the 1st, 6th, and 7th Infantry Divisions. The center was made up of the Light, 4th, and 5th Infantry Divisions. The left wing included the 3rd Infantry Division and two independent Portuguese brigades led by Brigadier Generals Denis Pack and Thomas Bradford. All three columns were covered by cavalry units. With the exception of the 1st and Light Divisions, Wellington organized all his infantry divisions with one Portuguese and two British or King's German Legion brigades. The 1st Division had one King's German Legion brigade and two British brigades while the Light Division had two brigades, each formed from British and Portuguese light infantry. On 16 June, as it neared Salamanca, the center column's cavalry chased away some French light cavalry. When Marmont received news on 14 June of the Allied offensive, he immediately ordered his army to concentrate at Fuentesa√∫co, north of Salamanca. His army included two cavalry divisions and the infantry divisions of Generals of Division Maximilien S√©bastien Foy, Bertrand Clausel, Claude Fran√ßois Ferey, Jacques Thomas Sarrut, Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune, Antoine Fran√ßois Brenier de Montmorand, and Jean Guillaume Barth√©lemy Thomi√®res, in numerical order from 1st to 7th. Brenier and Maucune and General of Brigade Jean- Baptiste Th√©odore Curto's light cavalry evacuated Salamanca and fell back to the rendezvous point. Foy marched from √Åvila far to the southeast, Clausel came from Pe√±aranda de Bracamonte to the southeast, Ferey started from Valladolid to the northeast, Thomi√®res marched from Zamora to the northwest, Sarrut came from Toro to the north, and General of Brigade Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier Boyer's dragoons started from Toro and from Benavente far to the north. By 19 June, Marmont had 36,000 infantry, 2,800 cavalry, and 80 artillery pieces assembled at Fuentesa√∫co. Despite Napoleon's instructions, Marmont also called in General of Division Jean Pierre Fran√ßois Bonet's 6,500 men from the Asturias, but these soldiers could not arrive for nearly three weeks. Wellington's army counted 28,000 British and 17,000 Portuguese, and a division of 3,000 Spaniards led by Major General Carlos de Espa√±a, altogether 48,000 men. With 3,500 cavalry, the Allies were superior to the French for the first time in this arm. Both Marmont and Wellington had an accurate idea of their opponent's strength and both were eager to fight a battle. However, Marmont preferred to wait until Bonet's division arrived so that his numbers would nearly equal his adversary's strength. The French commander also hoped to be reinforced by 8,000 troops from General of Division Marie-Fran√ßois Auguste de Caffarelli du Falga's Army of the North. These troops would assemble at Vitoria and march southwest. At this time Soult insisted that Wellington was about to descend upon Andalusia with 60,000 troops, when only Hill's 18,000 were observing his forces. Because of Soult's pleas for help, Joseph and Jourdan at Madrid were initially unsure whether Marmont or Soult was the British commander's real target. Siege Initial bombardment Map shows the Salamanca Forts and Allied batteries. On 17 June, Wellington's army enveloped Salamanca, with the left wing going north of the city and the center and right wing circling to the south. The three columns joined on the north side of Salamanca and then advanced to the San Christobal heights. Wellington hoped that besieging the Salamanca forts would goad Marmont into attacking him on the heights. Only the 14th Light Dragoons and the British 6th Division entered the city to lay siege to the forts. The Spanish citizens were delighted that the French were gone and gave the Allies a joyous welcome in the Plaza Mayor. Wellington set up his headquarters in the city while Major General Henry Clinton's 6th Division invested the forts. In order to prepare the forts for defense, Marmont's sappers had demolished a large part of the old University quarter in the southwest part of the city. Salamanca's Roman bridge was commanded by the La Merced fort. Wellington had been led to believe that the forts were hastily prepared medieval convents and that their reduction would be relatively easy. Because of this belief, the Allied army brought only four 18-pounder long guns, each with only 100 shot. In fact, the three convents were massively reinforced using masonry from the dismantled University buildings, oak beams, and earth. The convents had their walls doubled in thickness, their windows blocked up, their surroundings guarded by scarps, counter-scarps, and palisades. Mounting 30 cannons, the largest fort, San Vincente was located at the southwest angle of the old city wall. San Cayetano with four cannons was southeast of San Vincente. South of San Cayetano was La Merced with two guns that prevented the Allies using the Roman bridge over the Rio Tormes. San Vincente and La Merced overlooked the Tormes and were virtually impregnable against an attack from the south and west. Only the north sides of San Vincente and San Cayetano appeared promising to attack. San Vincente was separated from San Cayetano and La Merced by a ravine that ran southwest into the Tormes. The three forts were designed to be mutually supporting; any column attacking one fort could expect to come under a crossfire from the other forts. The French garrison consisted of six flank companies from the 17th Light, and the 15th, 65th, 82nd, and 86th Line Infantry Regiments plus an artillery company. Duchemin of the 65th Line commanded 800 soldiers and 36 mostly light guns. The British 6th Division included the 1st Brigade under Major General Richard Hulse, the 2nd Brigade led by Major General Barnard Foord Bowes, and the Portuguese brigade under Brigadier General Conde de Rezende. The 1st Brigade was made up of the 1/11th Foot, 2/53rd Foot, 1/61st Foot battalions, and one company of the 5/60th Foot. The 2nd Brigade comprised the 2nd Foot, 1/32nd Foot, 1/36th Foot battalions. The Portuguese brigade included the 9th Ca√ßadores Battalion, and two battalions each of the 8th and 12th Line Regiments. Lieutenant Colonel John Fox Burgoyne was the ranking engineer officer and Lieutenant Colonel May of the Royal Artillery commanded the 18-pounders. Burgoyne chose a position for the 18-pounders north of San Vincente. On the night of 17 June, 400 soldiers from the 6th Division began to dig the battery position. The working parties had no experience in siege work and the French had the area under cannon fire and musketry all night. In the morning the trench was only knee-deep and the workers had to be pulled back under cover. That night an exploring party was discovered and several men wounded by the defenders. The besiegers added 300 sharpshooters from the King's German Legion to their force in order to suppress the fire of the defenders. May borrowed three howitzers and two 6-pound cannons from the field artillery and put both cannons in the San Bernardo convent. These guns were too small to smash the walls, but their fire would annoy the defenders. By the morning of 19 June, the first battery was completed and the four 18-pounders and three howitzers opened fire, causing some damage to San Vincente. Meanwhile, two more battery locations were started, one to the west near San Bernardo and one to the east near the College of Cuenca. Two of the howitzers were moved into the Cuenca battery, but they came under such deadly fire that 20 gunners became casualties that day. On 20 June, Colonel Alexander Dickson arrived with a train of six 24-pound howitzers from the Portuguese fortress of Elvas. The three borrowed howitzers were sent back to the field artillery. Two of the 18-pounders were moved to the Cuenca battery and their fire brought down part of San Vincente's roof, killing some of its defenders. Seeing that his artillery was running low on ammunition, Wellington sent a request to Almeida for an ammunition resupply convoy. The bombardment was suspended. Relief attempt Auguste de Marmont Having assembled his army, Marmont advanced toward Salamanca on 20 June, pushing back the Allies' cavalry patrols. Wellington posted his army with his right flank at Cabrerizos on the Tormes and his left flank at San Crist√≥bal de la Cuesta. From right to left, were the 1st, 7th, 4th, Light, and 3rd Divisions and then Pack's and Bradford's brigades. The 5th Division, Hulse's brigade of the 6th Division, and Espa√±a's division were held in reserve. Major General Victor Alten's light cavalry brigade guarded the right flank while Colonel William Ponsonby's light cavalry brigade covered the left. The heavy cavalry brigades of Major Generals John Le Marchant and Eberhardt Otto George von Bock were in reserve. The two remaining brigades of the 6th Division maintained the investment of the three forts. Marmont's troops occupied Castellanos de Moriscos and then attacked Moriscos. The 68th Foot repulsed three attacks but Wellington pulled the unit back into his main defense line that night. Wellington expected to be attacked on the morning of 21 June, but Marmont initiated no action because the divisions of Foy and Thomi√®res and one dragoon brigade did not arrive until the afternoon. That morning, Wellington might have crushed his outnumbered adversary and his staff wondered why their chief did not attack. According to a letter he sent to Prime Minister Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool, Wellington hoped to stage another defensive victory like the Battle of Bussaco. That evening Marmont held a Council of war in which Maucune and Ferey advised him to attack but Clausel and Foy persuaded him not to. On 22 June, British commander realized Marmont was not going to attack. Still hoping to provoke an attack, Wellington had the 51st Foot and the 68th Foot from the British 7th Division drive the French from a knoll near Moriscos. This was accomplished with a British loss of seven killed and 26 wounded. That night, Marmont's army withdrew to a position near Aldearrubia with its left flank at Huerta near the Tormes. On 23 June, Wellington sent Hulse's brigade back to Salamanca and ordered Clinton to renew the siege of the forts. He also sent Bock's cavalry to patrol the west bank of the Tormes opposite Huerta. Assault On 23 June, Clinton renewed the siege of the three forts despite the handicap of having very little ammunition. The four 18-pounders only had 60 rounds altogether and the six howitzers had only 160 shells between them. The engineers and gunners decided to ignore San Vincente because it was too strong. Instead, they focused on reducing San Cayetano. With this in mind, one of the 18-pounders was moved to the San Bernardo battery in order to get an enfilade on a vulnerable point in San Cayetano. After firing all morning, the 18-pounders ran out of ammunition in the afternoon. San Cayetano was considerably damaged, but there was no breach in its walls. Despite this, Wellington ordered an assault to be carried out at 10 pm that night. The attacking force was made up of the six light companies from the brigades of Hulse and Bowes, approximately 300‚Äì400 men. Since there was no breach, the men carried 20 ladders in order to reach the parapet. The officers observed that, \\"the undertaking was difficult, and the men seemed to feel it\\". The assault was launched from some ruins near the Cuenca battery. As soon as the storming column burst from cover it came under deadly cannon and musket fire not only from San Cayetano, but from San Vincente as well. There were casualties from the first moment. Only two ladders were put up but no one dared to climb them, since by then it was clear that the attack was hopeless. The other ladders were poorly made and some fell apart as they were being carried. Bowes was slightly wounded at once while leading the assault. He dressed his wound and rushed back into the battle only to be killed at the foot of the ladders. The assault failed with a loss of six officers and 120 men killed or wounded. The British requested a truce to gather their dead and wounded, but the French refused and Bowes' corpse was not recovered until later. Final bombardment John Fox Burgoyne, 1855 The early morning of 24 June saw a heavy fog, accompanied by the muted sounds of musketry and by the occasional thud of a cannon firing. When the fog dissipated at 7 am, Wellington and his staff could see Bock's cavalry retreating before two French infantry divisions and a light cavalry brigade that had crossed the Tormes. The British army commander ordered Lieutenant General Thomas Graham to take the 1st and 7th Divisions and Le Marchant's cavalry across the river at Santa Marta de Tormes and block the French thrust. The French pressed ahead to the village of Calvarrasa de Abajo beyond which they found Graham's divisions deployed in a strong position. Suddenly, the French turned around and fell back across the Huerta fords. The Allies did not pursue. Graham's troops soon returned to their previous positions on the east bank. Neither army budged on 25 June. On this day, soldiers of the 6th Division completed a trench along the bottom of the ravine, cutting off San Vincente from the other two forts. Lord Wellington On the morning of 26 June, the ammunition convoy finally arrived. The artillerists moved all four 18-pounders into the San Bernardo battery and directed their fire at San Cayetano. Four howitzers were placed in the Cuenca battery and ordered to fire red hot shot into the roof of San Vincente. The bombardment began at 3 pm and continued all night long. Altogether, 18 separate fires started in the roof and tower of San Vincente and were put out by the garrison. A large amount of wood had been used by the French in order to strengthen the fort, and this provided the fuel. After four more hours of pounding on the morning of 27 June, the 18-pounders smashed a breach in the walls of San Cayetano. A new fire broke out in San Vincente; it ignited the main store of planks and threatened to explode the gunpowder magazine. Up until this time, the French return fire was intense, but the exhausted garrison's fire began to taper off. Wellington ordered San Cayetano to be stormed. The storming column formed in the ravine below San Cayetano. Just as the men were about to charge, a white flag appeared at the breach. The French commander asked for a truce, requesting a chance to communicate with Duchemin, and promising to surrender in two hours. Wellington demanded a surrender in five minutes, but the French officer continued to bargain. Despite this, the storming column came out of the ravine and rushed the fort. A few scattered shots wounded six attackers, then San Cayetano's garrison threw down their weapons. By this time, the fire in San Vincente was raging and a white flag waved there also. Duchemin asked for a three-hour truce, but Wellington repeated his earlier promise to storm the place in five minutes if no surrender was forthcoming. Duchemin tried to stall, but the 9th Ca√ßadores emerged from the ravine and entered the fort. There was no resistance and the French flag was quickly hauled down. The source did not mention how or when La Merced surrendered. Result British casualties were five officers and 94 men killed and 29 officers and 302 men wounded. French losses during the siege numbered 3 officers and 40 men killed, 11 officers and 140 men wounded, and slightly less than 600 unwounded men captured. Of the 14 killed or wounded officers, five belonged to the 65th Line, two each to the 15th Line and 17th Light, one each to the 86th, artillery, and engineers, and two were unaccounted for. In addition, the Allies captured 36 guns of various calibers, a good supply of gunpowder, and a substantial amount of clothing. The Allies razed the three forts. The seized gunpowder was handed over to d'Espa√±a's soldiers. On 7 July, careless handling caused a portion of the gunpowder to detonate, killing 20 civilians and some soldiers, and wrecking several houses. On 26 June, Marmont received a letter from the Army of the North in which Caffarelli explained that his reinforcements were not coming after all. Popham's naval squadron appeared in the Bay of Biscay and the Spanish guerillas began wreaking havoc in the north. Caffarelli could not spare a man because of these incursions. When, at dawn on 27 June, Duchemin signaled that he was still holding out, Marmont resolved on a desperate attempt to maneuver south of Salamanca. A few hours later, the forts ceased fire and soon Marmont guessed that they had capitulated. With the forts gone, on 28 June Marmont began his retreat north to the Rio Douro by forced marches. In early July, Marmont was joined by Bonet's division, which gave him numbers equal to Wellington. By 15 July he massed 50,000 soldiers for another offensive. Perhaps the most important result of the siege was Marmont's underestimation of Wellington's generalship. Because Wellington remained passively on the defensive during the siege, Marmont, \\"thought he could take liberties with his opponent\\". This may have led to Marmont's defeat at the Battle of Salamanca on 22 July 1812.

It allows scientists and special consultants to be hired as part of the Public Health Service or Environmental Protection Agency under a streamlined process \\"without regard to the civil- service laws\\". Courts have ruled that, although Title 42 appointments are exempt from hiring and compensation provisions of civil service laws, they are still entitled to protections relating to termination, including appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Title 42 hiring authority was first enacted in 1944 as part of the Public Health Service Act, and was extended to the Environmental Protection Agency on a limited basis in 2006. It is named after Title 42 of the United States Code, which contains its legal basis, and is contrasted with Title 5 employments which are normal civil service appointments. Legislative basis Title 42 appointments are described in a part of the Public Health Service Act of 1944, which has been codified as . The original text reads: The text about \\"compensation... without regard to the Classification Act of 1923, as amended\\" is present in the original law, but is omitted in the United States Code version as obsolete, although it is still legally binding. In 2006, the District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia ruled in Afshari v. Leavitt that the text \\"appointed without regard to the civil-service laws\\" refers solely to flexibility from normal hiring formalities; protections given to excepted service positions under the Civil Service Reform Act, such as those relating to termination, still apply. In 2016, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit similarly ruled in Lal v. Merit Systems Protection Board that the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990 had extended Merit Systems Protection Board appeal rights to Title 42 appointees who had served for at least two years. Regulations for special consultants are contained in , and those for fellowships are contained in .  Characteristics  Title 42 appointments are intended to attract and retain scientific personnel by providing hiring flexibility and salaries that are competitive with the private sector. However, the authority has been criticized for being overused and for providing salaries that are greater than those allowed under the General Schedule.  Public Health Service  The Public Health Service consists of eight of the eleven agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services that deal with public health. As of 2010, there were 6,697 employees working in Public Health Service Title 42 positions. Of these, 4,879 were in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 929 were in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 862 were in the Food and Drug Administration, and 27 were in other agencies. This accounted for 25% of all NIH employees, including 44% of the research and clinical practitioner workforce; 10% of CDC employees; and 6% of FDA employees. The number of Title 42 appointees increased by 25% from 2006 to 2010. There is a total pay cap of $275,000 for Title 42 appointees; about one- fifth of Title 42 appointments pay higher than $155,500 in 2010, which is equivalent to Level IV of the Executive Schedule and the highest pay allowable to General Schedule employees. As of 2014, Title 42 appointments can last for five years with an unlimited number of extensions. Special consultants under 209(f) are usually appointed as senior officials in the Office of the Director of the relevant agency, while the fellowships under 209(g) are used to hire research scientists and clinicians. In order to hire under Title 42, it must be documented that candidates could not be found through traditional hiring authorities such as Title 5, the Senior Biomedical Research Service, and the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. However, a small number of high- level positions are exempt from the documentation requirement, including Senior Investigators, Scientific Executives, Institute and Center Directors, and the NIH Deputy Director. Within NIH, Title 42 appointments may be used to fill Senior Investigator/Scientist/Clinician, Investigator, Staff Scientist/Clinician, Adjunct Investigator, Senior Research/Clinical Fellow, and Research/Clinical Fellow positions. Within CDC, there are three categories of Title 42 appointment. Regular Fellows are classified as trainees; they must have at least a bachelor's degree and receive pay equal to GS-5 through GS-9 on the General Schedule. Associate Service Fellows and Senior Service Fellows require a master's degree or doctoral degree respectively, plus related post- graduate experience. Associate Service Fellows receive pay equal to GS-9 through GS-12, and Senior Service Fellows receive pay equal to GS-13 through GS-15, with both receiving retirement and insurance benefits. Within FDA, Title 42 appointments are divided into Service Fellowships, Commissioner's Fellowships, Special Consultants, and Special Government Employees. Service Fellows must have a doctoral degree and are divided into Staff Fellows, who have less than two years of postdoctoral experience, and Senior Staff Fellows who have more than two years of postdoctoral experience. Staff Fellows receive pay equal to GS-9 through GS-12, and Senior Staff Fellows receive pay equal to GS-13 through GS-15. The Commissioner's Fellowship program is a two-year appointment involving coursework and a research project, requires either a doctoral degree or a lower degree in engineering, and pays equivalent to step one of GS-11, 12, or 13.  Environmental Protection Agency  200x200px Beginning in 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency has been able to make Title 42 appointments in its Office of Research and Development. This authority was given because existing types of positions were too restricted to either administrative management, advisory functions, and laboratory research, with little flexibility to combine more than one of these; and because the hiring processes were too slow and the salaries uncompetitive. The authority is generally used to appoint scientists and senior managers; as of 2014, most of the Title 42 appointments were for Division Directors or National Program Directors. The number of Title 42 appointments has been subject to a cap; since 2014 the cap has been 50 appointees at any one time. As of 2013, Title 42 appointees were paid in a band of $130,810‚Äì250,000.  History  These provisions were first enacted in 1944 as part of the Public Health Service Act, and as of 2012 had not been amended since. It was an extension of an authority that had originally been given to the National Cancer Institute in 1937. Regulations were first issued in 1947. Until 1966, there were limitations on the number of days per fiscal year Title 42 appointees could work, initially limited to half the number of working days. Beginning in 1956, a pay cap was instituted on Title 42 positions that is higher than that permitted to General Schedule appointees. In 2005, Congress extended Title 42 hiring authority to the Environmental Protection Agency. This was the result of a recommendation in a 2000 National Research Council report. Initially this was limited to five appointments per fiscal year; as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, this was changed to a cap of 30 persons at any one time, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 increased the cap to 50 persons.

Biography Mar√≠a Cecilia Li√±eira was born in Buenos Aires in 1983. She has a university degree in Surgical Instrumentation, a profession she practiced in her home country, where she attended several operations. Her degree was not recognized in Spain, and she has studied in two other fields: nursing, and psychology at the National University of Distance Education (UNED). Career Cecilia Li√±eira started her professional basketball career at her native Lan√∫s, but when she was very young she decided to cross the Atlantic. She has a Community passport, since she has family connections to Argentina, Poland, Spain, Italy, and the Czech Republic. The passport of the latter country, the home of her grandfather, opened the doors to European basketball for her. She has been described as \\"a leader both on the court and in the locker room.\\" Since 2006 she has played for six Spanish clubs. The first was CB Pio XII in A Coru√±a, where she spent two seasons playing in Liga Femenina 2 (LF2). Since then, Li√±eira's career has been linked to the Basque Autonomous Community. From 2008 to 2011 she joined the ranks of UNB Obenasa Navarra, playing her last season there in the Liga Femenina (LF). From there she returned to the lower division to play for Irlandesas for half a year, before joining Ibaizabal. The club achieved promotion to the LF, with Li√±eira being named Most Valuable Player that season. She has played for promotion to the LF five times, achieving it twice, hence her nickname \\"Miss Ascenso\\". In 2014, Li√±eira was named to LF2's \\"Ideal Quintet\\" (Quinteto Ideal) of the day on four occasions, highlighting her performance in Ourense, where she was named MVP of Day 16 with 30 points, 19 rebounds and 4 assists for a total of 50 valuation points. She has averaged 14.2 points and 8.4 rebounds (19.1 valuation points, making her the fifth most valued player in group A). Days before the start of the 2017‚Äì2018 season, Cecilia Li√±eira, renewed by Araski AES, was forced to suspend her sports career due to an irrevocable job offer in Pamplona, which she felt she had to accept due to economic concerns. For the 2018‚Äì2019 season she signed for the club Megacalzado Ardoi, with which she achieved promotion to LF2.

In 1997 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its intact Late Victorian architecture and its role in the community. With . The first permanent settler at what would become Omro was Edward West, in 1845. By 1848 he had been joined by dozens of other settlers - mostly farmers. Sawmills on the river followed shortly, and in 1849 the village of Omro was platted. In 1857 the village was chartered. More businesses started, and even more after the railroad arrived in 1861. By 1891, Omro's population was 1600. In that year the village trustees created a fire department, buying a horse-drawn fire engine and two hand-pulled hose carts. This expensive equipment needed protection, so the trustees bought a small frame building to serve as Omro's first fire engine house. At that early date, all the village offices were scattered around town. A few years later, in 1895, the village board decided to construct a better building \\"for the use of the fire department, etc.\\" Local builder and architect Fred Root proposed a design in February, 1896. Bids were taken, and by July the building was usable. Thomas Thompson was the masonry contractor and Stanton, Lillicrap and Root were carpentry contractors. The hall was built for $5000. The building sits on a cut stone foundation, with walls of pink brick rising two stories to a hip roof, which is covered in the original standing seam metal. Above the main block a large square tower rises another two stories, incorporating a four-faced Seth Thomas clock and an open belfry. The belfry holds the original 900-pound bronze fire bell. The vertical emphasis, the asymmetrical massing, and the variety of surface textures are typical elements of Queen Anne architectural style. Inside, the garage doors led to an engine room on the first floor, where the fire department stored its equipment. To the west, the front room originally housed the village jail, but later the public library. A straight stairway leads to the second floor, which is divided into three rooms. One was the office of the village clerk, containing a walk-in vault which protected the clerk's papers. The 1896 village hall and engine house was used until 1966, when most of its functions moved to the Omro Theatre building. After that, some wanted to demolish the building to create parking spaces, but that was rejected in a referendum. Instead the building housed some civic organizations until 1981. Since then it has been leased to the Omro Area Historical Society and serves as a museum.

Early Life Amelia Lape√±a-Bonifacio, known as Tita Amel to her students, was born in Binondo, Manila in 1930. She studied Japanese traditional theatre (supported by Office of Asian Pacific Affairs ASPAC), South East Asian traditional theatre (supported by the Ford Foundation), and international children‚Äôs theatre (supported by the Toyota Foundation). Research convinced her of the necessity of a theatre for young audiences using Asian and Filipino folktales and utilizing puppets inspired by Japanese Bunraku and Indonesian wayang (rod puppets and shadow theatre styles).https://wepa.unima.org/en/amelia-lapena-bonifacio/ Bonifacio became a Fulbright scholar in 1956 and obtained her Master of Arts degree in Speech and Drama at the University of Wisconsin in 1958. She wrote her first play, ‚ÄúSepang Loca,‚Äù in 1957 and followed this up with ‚ÄúRooms‚Äù the following year. Both works won awards in the Wisconsin Playwrighting Competition and were staged at the UW Play Circle Theater, with the author herself designing ‚ÄúSepang Loca.‚Äù The two plays were later published in literary journals in the United States.https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/165034/amelia-lapena-bonifacio- grand-lady-of-philippine-puppet-theater/ During those times, the young Asian Fulbright scholar was told by one of her American professors that her one-act play had 18 characters, far too numerous for the standard format of that time. Her material also delved into abortion, which was barely spoken of in the 1950s. The young Amelia replied that in her milieu, Asian plays did tend to have a lot of characters, regardless of the running time. Not long after, the professor apologized to her privately for not assessing her play correctly.https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320041/amelia-lapena-bonifacio-keeps- puppet-theater-alive-and-relevant/ Her research into traditional theatre of the Philippines was supported by the University of the Philippines' Office of Research Coordination, Zarzuela Foundation of the Philippines, Inc., and the American Philosophical Society.https://wepa.unima.org/en/amelia-lapena- bonifacio/ Pioneering works As a young faculty member, she helped establish the Speech and Drama Department of the University of the Philippines - Diliman in 1959 and taught subjects like History of the Theatre and Fundamentals of Speech in the early 1960s until she moved back to the Department of English and Comparative Literature. She contributed significant efforts to the advancement and refinement of the study and practice of theater arts in the Philippines. In 1976, Lape√±a-Bonifacio published Anim na Dulang Pilipino Para Sa Mga Bata, with six-year-old daughter supplying illustrations and also influenced by traditional Asian theater techniques. Originally a playwright for adult audiences, she has since then written and directed many other plays for children, most of them based on Asian folktales. In 1977, Lape√±a-Bonifacio was invited by the University of the Philippines Department of Speech and Drama to present one of her plays. She wrote and directed Abadeja: Ang Ating Sinderela, a puppet play based on a Visayan folktale about the Cinderella-like Abadeja. With December shows at the Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero Theater, Abadeja was performed in cooperation with Dulaang UP and UP Repertory Company. Her first puppet play, ‚ÄúAbadeja: Ang Ating Sinderella,‚Äù with music by Felipe M. de Leon Jr. and puppets by Rafael del Casals, was favorably reviewed in the press. With the enthusiasm of the cast's continued visits to her office and her long-standing dream of forming a children's theater group, Lape√±a- Bonifacio founded in 1977 the children's theater troupe \\"Teatrong Mulat ng Pilipinas\\" (Aware Theatre of the Philippines), the official theater company and puppetry troupe of the University of the Philippines.https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/165034/amelia-lapena-bonifacio- grand-lady-of-philippine-puppet-theater/ She stirred an aghast publichttps://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320041/amelia-lapena-bonifacio-keeps- puppet-theater-alive-and-relevant/ after the Asian lady puppeteer commented on Jim Henson of ‚ÄúSesame Street\\" during an arts festival in Washington, D.C that Henson's puppetry approach would not work on the other side of the globe due to three reasons: first, Sesame Street at the time engaged in some violence, secondly, the show‚Äôs scenes were too short, whereas a child‚Äôs attention span could be held for a much longer time, and finally, the pie-in-the-face antics could be interpreted as a sign of disrespect.https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320041/amelia-lapena-bonifacio- keeps-puppet-theater-alive-and-relevant/ With a shocked audience, the young lady added, ‚ÄúIf kids have a short attention span, then how come our children back home can watch puppet shows for an hour? And, please, stop throwing all that food around. If that is funny to you Westerners, food for us Asians is almost sacred‚Äîit can be a matter of life or death.‚Äùhttps://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320041/amelia-lapena-bonifacio-keeps- puppet-theater-alive-and-relevant/ After the encounter, Henson would later come up with a full-length puppetry-packed movie, ‚ÄúThe Dark Crystal,‚Äù which had Asian themes like peace-building and equilibrium between the yin and the yang.https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320041/amelia-lapena-bonifacio-keeps- puppet-theater-alive-and-relevant/ Lape√±a-Bonifacio released \\"Sepang Loca & Others,\\" a first volume of works in English, on 28 January 1981.https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4174013-sepang-loca-others The collection includes two plays that won playwriting awards at the University of Wisconsin, ten author-selected short stories, several poems and essays. During the Marcos dictatorship, Amelia's theatre company released \\"Ang Paghuhukom,‚Äù based on the Pampanga folktale of the animal kingdom, which took swipes at the martial law regime. The main character, the ape king of the jungle, kept smashing the other animals to enforce silence and control, until he ended up smashing himself. The government noticed the theatre company, but only after the dictator's wife, Imelda Marcos, saw one play, ‚ÄúManok at Lawin,‚Äù at Quirino Grandstand. The first lady, unknowing of the Ang Paghuhukom play at the time, tasked the Cultural Center of the Philippines to fund Bonifacio's theatre company. Teatrong Mulat afterwards performed dozens of shows in various countries.https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320041/amelia-lapena-bonifacio-keeps- puppet-theater-alive-and-relevant/ Bonifacio's theatre company was invited to the International Workshop On Living Children‚Äôs Theatre in Asia (1978), where performances in eighteen sites in Japan gained media attention. At the International Puppet Festival in Tashkent, former USSR (1979), Mulat premiered The Trial to acclaim. In 1980, with Tokyo-based Ohanashi Caravan, Mulat toured Metro Manila and provinces, and the group participated in International Workshops On Living Children‚Äôs Theatre in the Philippines (1983), Malaysia (1985), Thailand (1987), and Indonesia (1989).https://wepa.unima.org/en/amelia-lapena-bonifacio/ Papet Pasyon (Puppet Passion Play, 1985), with music by Professor Rodolfo de Leon, has been staged annually since 1985, and translates the Filipino tradition of reciting the death and resurrection of Jesus into a puppet version for children.https://wepa.unima.org/en/amelia-lapena-bonifacio/ Later years The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption which devastated numerous provinces in the Philippines highly influenced Bonifacio's craft. Through the University of the Philippines College of Medicine's advice, the Teatrong Mulat showed Pinatubo's traumatized children their plays to help the children in coping up with the horrors caused by the second most powerful volcanic eruption in the 20th century. In the next few years, the theater company performed in 30 refugee or relocation sites in Pampanga and Zambales. Each site would have approximately 100 children.https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320041/amelia-lapena-bonifacio- keeps-puppet-theater-alive-and-relevant/ Bonifacio's theatre company presented Sita & Rama: Papet Ramayana in 2004 which interpreted the Indian epic Ramayana through shadow and rod puppetry with music by Joey Ayala and Cynthia Alexander and directed by the Bonifacio's daughter, Amihan Bonifacio-Ramolete. In 2006, a house near the University of the Philippines, which served as Mulat's 100-seat base, was rebuilt and reopened as the Amelia Lape√±a-Bonifacio Teatro Papet Museo (Puppet Museum) through government funding and grants from former presidents Fidel V. Ramos and Joseph E. Estrada.https://wepa.unima.org/en/amelia-lapena-bonifacio/ The most memorable celebration of her work occurred in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2009 at the International Puppetry Festival under the auspices of the UNESCO National Commission. A journalist noted that during a break in the performance of The Ramayana, \\"the performers approached her (she had been placed in the front row), clasped their palms, bowed and kissed her on both cheeks. When, misty- eyed, she kissed them back, the audience rose to their feet.\\"https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/165034/amelia-lapena-bonifacio-grand- lady-of-philippine-puppet-theater/ In February 2010, the University of the Philippines‚Äô Department of Speech Communication and Theatre Arts conferred her the title ‚ÄúMother of Philippine Puppetry‚Äù to recognize Lape√±a-Bonifacioo's efforts in promoting Philippine stories and Asian puppetry and eventually creating a Philippine puppet tradition. Land, Sea and Sky, a 1991 play, was again launched by Bonifacio's theatre company in 2012 to raise awareness on various environmental concerns that the country is facing. Bonifacio's daughter began leading the theatre company on the same year.

A case of direct democracy, the system allows for the existence of two bodies: the Mayor and the asamblea vecinal (\\"neighboring assembly\\"), also known as concejo, formed by the all the electors of the municipality. It is also used by other entities below the municipal level. The origins of the regime trace back to the Middle Ages, as a custom primarily originated in the Kingdoms of Le√≥n and Castile, although it also extended to other territories as well, chiefly in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. In many settlements, the concejo abierto was replaced by the \\"regimiento\\" system (also called consejo cerrado, \\"close council\\"), in which a decision-making body of limited size formed by judges or alcaldes as well as a number of regidores appointed by the King was contemplated; in the case of Castile, this process chiefly took place between 1345 and the later years of the rule of Alfonso XI. The contemporary form of the concejo abierto regime is recognised in the 1978 Spanish Constitution (Art. 140). This system contrasts with the conventional regime used by most municipalities, in which the government authority (the ayuntamiento, often translated as city or municipal council in English) comprises in its most basic form the local councillors who form the plenary (elected in a party-list proportional representation voting), and the Mayor, elected in turn by the councillors among themselves.

Life Alderson was born on 14 May 1924 in Baku, to a Russian family of two academics from Moscow. Her father, a neurophysiologist, had been a student of Ivan Pavlov. She began studying mathematics at Moscow University in 1937, when she was only 13. She had to break off her studies because of World War II, moving to Paris as a refugee with her family. After the war, she returned to study at the University of Edinburgh. She completed a Ph.D. there in 1951; her dissertation was Logarithmetics of Non-Associative Algebras. After leaving mathematical research to raise two children in Cambridge, she was funded by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation with a Fellowship at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, beginning in the late 1960s. At Cambridge, she worked with J. W. S. Cassels. She died on 5 November 1972, from complications of kidney disease. Research In the theory of higher reciprocity laws, Alderson published necessary and sufficient conditions for 2 and 3 to be seventh powers, in modular arithmetic modulo a given prime number p. According to , \\"plain quasigroups were first studied by Helen Popova- Alderson, in a series of papers dating back to the early fifties\\". Smith cites in particular a posthumous paper and its references. In this context, a quasigroup is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of elements and a binary operation that does not necessarily obey the associative law, but where (like a group) this operation can be inverted. Being plain involves having only a finite number of elements and no non-trivial subalgebras. Translation As well as Russian, English, and French, Alderson spoke Polish, Czech, and some German. She became the English translator of Elementary Number Theory, a textbook originally published in Russian in 1937 by B. A. Venkov. Her translation was published by Wolters-Noordhoff of Groningen in 1970. As well as the original text, it includes footnotes by Alderson updating the material with new developments in number theory.

He is currently the longest-serving prisoner in Germany.  Early life and murder  Neumann was born the son of a prostitute and grew up in an urban orphanage in Kreuzberg as well as in a foster family. On 29 December 1951 he was admitted to the Jugendhof Schlachtensee by a juvenile judge for various thefts. In the discharge report, the boy was described a year later as \\"calm and kind, open-minded and in need of love\\". In 1953, his foster mother died. He found a connection in the family of a master craftsman, where he made an apprenticeship to precision mechanic. In 1956 he embarked for Canada but was deported to Germany in 1961 after being convicted of armed robbery. On 13 January 1962 he kidnapped a pair of lovers sitting in a parked car in Berlin and shot them, after the woman had resisted, with a Smith & Wesson .38-caliber revolver,Berliner Zeitung: Bew√§hrung nach 52 Jahren Haft abgelehnt: Keine Gnade f√ºr Berliner H√§ftling which he always carried with him. He was arrested six days later. The man had survived badly injured and was able to identify Neumann, but died shortly thereafter.  Imprisonment  Neumann was sentenced to life imprisonment on 30 May 1963 for the double murder he committed. The trial attracted national attention. The painter Gerhard Richter based one of his paintings on photos of the trial. Neumann first served his sentence at Tegel Prison, then from 1991 at Bruchsal Prison. In Bruchsal he was considered a quiet prisoner; a first version took place in 1993. In March 1994, the District Court of Karlsruhe found that even life imprisonment no longer required further serving. However, applications for suspended probation (¬ß 57a StGB) have since been rejected on a regular basis because experts have certified it a negative social forecast. He was also denied a pardon. In a report dated 5 June 2012, chief physician of the psychiatric-center Nordbaden wrote: \\"All in all, it can be said that after 50 years in prison, Mr. Neumann seems as unbounded as when he was arrested.\\" Since the death of the serial killer Heinrich Pommerenke in 2008, Neumann has been the longest-serving prisoner in Germany with more than 56 years in prison. On 28 March 2014 the Oberlandesgericht Karlsruhe on the immediate appeal of the then defender, the decision of Penal Enforcement Division at District Court of Karlsruhe confirmed, with which his application for parole was again rejected. Neumann's new defense lawyer filed an appeal against this decision on 28 April 2014 in the Federal Constitutional Court constitutional complaint. This was rejected as unfounded. Neumann filed another application for parole in 2016, but then withdrew it.

As a British colony, Nigeria entered the war on the side of the Allies. Nigeria was a key country in the African theatre of war, with Nigeria serving as a critical part of the Allied African strategy. In addition to Nigeria's importance as a staging point in Africa, several infantry regiments were raised to serve the British armies around Africa and Asia. Throughout the war, 45,000 Nigerian soldiers served in the British Army in Africa and southeast Asia. Nigerian regiments formed the majority of the 81st and 82nd West Africa Divisions of the British Army. Nigerian soldiers fought in most notably Burma and India. Despite the successful fighting record of the Nigerian troops, none of the commanding officers of the Nigerian corps were from Nigeria. These were instead selected from around the British Commonwealth. The first Nigerian officers were selected towards the war's end. Nigeria's involvement in WWII helped fuel the struggle for independence from colonial rule. This was partly because participation of Africans in these wars exposed them to ideas of self- determination and independent rule.  Outbreak of war  Nigeria's entry was first marked by a verbal agreement to join the Allied Forces in declaration of war against Germany. Nigeria accepted the British invitation to join the war almost unanimously. Influential Nigerian political leaders such as Nnamdi Azikiwe and Herbert Macaulay, hitherto critics of British colonial rule, reversed gear and appealed to all Nigerians to support the war effort. Within days of the declaration, the Nigerian War Relief Fund (NWRF) was established, a volunteer fundraising movement designed to increase local support for Britain. Initially, the war had significant popular support in Nigeria. While many soldiers joined the British Army willingly, there were instances of forced conscription of Nigerian men, some as young as 16. In response to critical manpower shortages following the invasion of Europe by Axis Powers, England and France began to scour their colonies for supplies of able-bodied fighting men. These men included combatants, military laborers and specialist units, and from 1942 onward, their role transformed from a defensive role in defending the empire in Africa, to an offensive role in repelling Japanese invaders in the far eastern parts of the British Empire. The British Home office was aware that by sending colonial soldiers it would risk exposing them to radical political ideas which could eventually destabilize British rule in Africa, African forces were therefore sent more commonly to south-east Asia. Despite British claims that their African forces were largely volunteers, the majority of Nigerian soldiers in WWII were conscripted through tribal authorities or private workplaces.  Combat deployments   East Africa  The first Nigerian units to see combat in WWII served in the British campaigns in East Africa. In 1940, the 1st (West Africa) Brigade was the first Nigerian unit to be deployed against the Axis Powers in Kenya. A total of 9,000 West African soldiers fought alongside regiments from the Gold Coast (present day Ghana), and the other British Colonial possessions in West- Africa. At this stage in the war, Nigeria's troop contributions were relatively small, and would not grow until the conclusion of the African campaigns of the war. Throughout the East African Campaigns, the Nigerian forces were organised at battalion level, and no whole divisions were created from Nigerian soldiers. Despite this, British officers reported being impressed with the capabilities of the Nigerian soldiers, of which their participation in the capture of Mogadishu and the rapid advance towards Dehegabur can be highlighted. For many Nigerian citizens, the invasion of Ethiopia at the outbreak of WWII was a wake-up call to the Axis threat. Therefore, as early as 1935, Nigerian efforts on the home front were concentrated on raising funds to support the war effort in Ethiopia.  Burma  After the success of the Allied campaigns in Africa, and with increasing need for soldiers to be deployed elsewhere, British command decided to form two divisions to fight in southeast Asia. The 81st Division was formed from West African brigades, then deployed in 1943. In 1944, the 82nd (West Africa) Division was formed, then sailed to British Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka) from the east coast of Africa. They then moved to Burma and took part in the third Arakan campaign in December 1944. Indian soldiers mingle with men of the 81st West African Division after the latter had arrived in India for jungle training The Allied forces in Burma faced a more experienced and entrenched Japanese Imperial force. Despite this, through use of aerial re-supply and effective use of the jungle terrain, the Allied forces were able to push the Japanese out of Burma. The jungle terrain forced the Allied forces to adopt new tactics and logistical strategies, a task which the Nigerian forces excelled at. The two West African divisions uniquely used non-combatant soldiers as porters, auxiliaries head-carrying supplies and ammunition. While British units used traditional resupply methods, the African porters enabled the West African divisions greater mobility than even the famed Chindit units native to Burma. The British units used their air-superiority to great effect throughout the campaign, with the RAF flying resupply missions which enabled the Allied forces to effectively fight in the jungles. West African casualties in Burma, August 1944. Soldiers from the 81st (West Africa) Division had been injured in intense jungle conflict. The 81st Division was initially deployed deep into the front, where it faced intense fighting for nearly a year before being relieved by the 82nd Division. By January 1945, the 82nd Division had reached Apuakwa on the Kaladan River, where they had been ordered to meet up with the 81st Division. From here the 81st Division was initially intended to return to India for rest and refit, and the 82nd Division was to take up the 81st Division's role of engaging Japanese elements. The largest engagement of the campaign fought by Nigerian forces was the Battle of Myohaung, a swiftly executed operation to seize the town of Myohaung. Both Nigerian divisions were deployed to encircle the city, with the 81st Division due to return to India after the town's capture. After some fierce fighting on the outskirts of the city, the Japanese forces evacuated the city upon realizing they had been surrounded. The recapture of Myohaung was strategically important as the city lay on major supply routes for Japan. Actions of the Allied combatants ultimately forced a Japanese evacuation of the Mayu peninsula, capturing areas which had been held by Japan for nearly four years. British troops continued to advance along the Mayu peninsula until the Japanese conceded the area entirely. The involvement of Nigerian forces was critical for this campaign.  Home front  A Nigerian cocoa farmer in 1940 In preparation for the outbreak of a world war, the British government secretly developed several schemes to retain foreign exchange and ensure the supply of commodities necessary for a war effort. In 1939, as part of the plans the Nigerian colonial administration set up the Nigeria Supply Board to regulate trade and manage production. That year a series of \\"defense regulations\\" were instituted, granting vast power to the board and other administrates to control the distribution of imports and foodstuffs. In the early stages of the war, British commanders and colonial officials had not anticipated that Africa would be heavily involved in the conflict. After the rapid success of Germany's Blitzkrieg in Europe, the British Government declared that winning the war would require a supreme effort from every person in the empire. Part of this effort would include increasing production of wartime commodities, meanwhile drastically reducing social spending, development, and imports of goods deemed non-essential. Additionally, direct taxes were increased on the population, a measure which would erupt in a country-wide strikes in 1945 and 1947 against the harsh British demands. Throughout the war, Nigerian attitudes towards the British grew steadily worse as the demands of the Nigerian War Relief Fund became harder to meet. The British wartime Home Office strongly encouraged and incentivised Nigerian miners and farmers to increase their output of raw materials. In particular heavy demand was placed on rubber and coal. Nigerian women played a critical role in collecting the harvests of Nigeria's two largest crop exports: cocoa and palm oil. Farmers were forced to produce these cash crops instead of food for the duration of the war. At the outbreak of war, the British government prohibited exports of cocoa and palm oil to Germany in order to deprive them of critical wartime goods. The government became the sole purchaser of all of Nigeria's cash crops, and could therefore lower prices however they saw fit. As a result, continuation of cocoa farming became highly difficult for small rural farmers, many of whom abandoned their farms due to sustained years of producing at a loss. As in many places throughout WWII, Nigeria experienced an acute shortage of food from the years 1939‚Äì1945. Rationing was introduced and lasted as late as 1948 in some parts of the country. In order to procure basic items like salt, flour, butter or tinned milk a ration card was required. In addition to rationing, the government put restrictions on the movement of food within the country, for example: banning the movement of rice between Abeokuta and Lagos. Smugglers attempting to transport rice into Lagos were either fined or put on criminal trial for subverting the war effort. Media was used to propagate support for the war throughout the country. Radio broadcasts were relayed throughout the country, broadcasting programming from the BBC and local broadcasters. Newspapers like The Yoruba News brought information of the progression of the war in the Yoruba language as well as English. In both of these cases, the media was produced primarily in English, with Yoruba publications emerging later in the war. The aims of these outlets was fundraising for the Nigeria War Relief Fund.  After the war  Nigerian soldiers returning home after the war received little official thanks for their involvement in the war. Upon successful completion of the Allied objectives in Burma, Nigerian troops were not included in the victory speech by commanding officer General William Slim. Upon return to Nigeria, a general frustration with their colonial overseers and a renewed sense of national pride contributed significantly to the pushes for Independence in post-war Nigeria. Throughout the war, Nigerians had fought under European officers, and it was not until many years after the war's conclusion that the first Nigerian officer was commissioned in 1949. Combined with the tensions which had emerged on the home-front throughout the war, Nigeria pushed significantly for the principles of self-determination following the war. Like many nations following the end of WWII, wartime experiences inspired the population to attempt to gain independence. The Nigerian Civil War of 1966 was fought and organised by many veterans of WWII. The general strike of 1945 has been credited as one of the defining moments in Nigeria's history. The strike was orchestrated by trade unionists across the country and included delegates from the farming, railway, mining, manufacturing and teaching unions.

Its roots can be traced to indentured Chinese who were brought to work as cooks in country pubs and sheep stations. Migrant numbers exploded with the gold rushes of the 19th century. By 1890, a third of all cooks were Chinese. Historians believe exemptions for Chinese chefs under the White Australia policy led to the eventual spread of Chinese restaurants across suburbs and country towns. Most early Chinese migrants were from Guangdong province, and so Cantonese cuisine became the chief influence, using locally available vegetables and more meat than was usual in traditional recipes. Later Chinese immigration, as well as increasingly adventurous domestic palates, have led to restaurants with more authentic dishes from a wider selection of provinces. Chinese food is Australia's favourite foreign cuisine.  History  Not until the Australian Gold Rushes did many Chinese immigrants move to the country. The gold rushes drew thousands of Chinese people, mostly from villages in Southern China - especially the Pearl River delta. In 1855, there were 11,493 Chinese arrivals in Melbourne, Victoria. As gold was rare, and mining always a dangerous job, Chinese people started to do different jobs to earn a living. Many chose to open small grocery stores or fruit and vegetable-hawking businesses, enter the fishing and fish curing industry. or become market gardeners. Other Chinese immigrants decided to open restaurants that served traditional dishes. Perhaps because the White Australia policy had an exemption for chefs, many Chinese immigrants and their families became chefs in Australia. By 1890, it was said that 33% of all the cooks in Australia were Chinese. Over time, these Chinese communities grew and established Chinatowns in several major cities around Australia, including Sydney (Chinatown, Sydney), Melbourne (Chinatown, Melbourne) and Brisbane (Chinatown, Brisbane) and as well as regional towns associated with the goldfields such as Cairns Chinatown.\\"99 Grafton St (entry 602511)\\". Queensland Heritage Register. Queensland Heritage Council. Retrieved 14 October 2018.}  Chinese Cuisine in Australia  Australian Chinese cuisine cooking styles were derived from the cooking styles of provinces such as Sichuan and Guangdong. Therefore, Chinese cuisine in Australia from the beginning were usually hot, spicy and numbing (Sichuan cuisine); and/or sweet and sour (Guangdong cuisine).Cantonese Cuisine. (2017, July). Retrieved September 18, 2018, from https://www.chinatours.com/culture/chinese-food/cantonese-cuisine.html During the first Gold Rush period, Chinese labourers were found working their second job at small food stores which were referred to as \\"cookhouses\\" to serve their own people.Maxabella, B. (2018, June 21). A (Brief) History of Australian Food. Retrieved September 10, 2018, from https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2018/06/21/brief-history-australian-food However, at this time, there was little accessibility towards traditional ingredients, especially vegetables such as bok choy and choy sum. As a result, after the White Australia policy was revoked, many Chinese migrants brought seeds from China and started to grow their own vegetables at home to increase the variety in Australia. Since then, the Australian Chinese cuisine started to develop more authentically with an increasing utilisation of traditional ingredients. Nowadays, Australia has welcomed and adapted to different Chinese cooking styles from different provinces including Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and others. Nonetheless, there are still differences between the Chinese cuisine found in China and Australia. Chinese food has been named as Australia's favourite cuisine according to Roy Morgan Research.Morgan, R. (2016, May). Australian's rank Chinese cuisine as their favourite, Roy Morgan Research. Retrieved September 18, 2018, from http://www.ausfoodnews.com.au/2016/05/23/australians-rank-chinese-cuisine-as- their-favourite-roy-morgan-research.html However, despite its popularity, Australian Chinese cuisine still slightly differs to the authentic Chinese cuisine. One of the reason for this is due to the conflicts between Australian and Chinese people. In order for these Chinese restaurants to survive, Chinese chefs were expected to provide food that would not directly compete with that of white establishments, but would still suit Western tastes. As a result, many Australian Chinese restaurants have adjusted their food to better adapt to the Australians' appetites. For instance, traditional cuisines of China considers vegetables as a main dish; while Westerners only treat vegetables as side dishes. To better suit the local diners, Chinese restaurants offer more meat options on the menus.The Little-Known History of Chinese Restaurants in Australia. (2016, March). Retrieved September 18, 2018, from http://www.newcastlediggers.com.au/news/chinese-restaurants-in-australia/ A fried Dim sim with soy sauce Moreover, as Guangdong's cooking styles focusing on producing a fresh and tender taste. Their cooking methods usually favor steaming and braising the most. However, to better adapt to the Australian palates, deep-fried and saucy Asian dishes have also been included in the new menus. These includes sweet and sour pork, sticky lemon chicken and dim sim. Inspired by the authentic Chinese style of dishes, dim sum, the dim sim or ‚Äúdimmy‚Äù is developed by Chinese chef William Wing Young around 1945 in Melbourne. Dimsim is a dumpling with thick (crispy) skin filled with meat and is usually fried. It is normally mistaken for dim sum - small bite-sized portions of food served in small baskets which are usually cooked by the steaming method. Another example showing the adaptation of the Chinese cuisine can be seen through how Matthew Chan has developed Peacock Gardens Restaurant into the symbol of Modern Australian Chinese cuisine. In an interview with News.com.au, Matthew said that back in the 70's, Australian customers are not yet familiar with dishes such as ‚Äúchicken chop suey, san choy bow and beef and black bean\\". It was Matthew Chan who has introduced these dishes into Australia with a few Western twists. For example, with 'san choy bow', understanding that Australian people were not familiar with pigeon meat, Chan decided to change the main protein to pork and beef mince. Furthermore, many vegetables were also substituted: cabbage to celery; bamboo shoots to water chestnuts; and most notably how Western broccoli have been used more frequently instead of Chinese broccoli . Furthermore, as the popularity of Chinese cuisine has been increasing steadily in Australia for the past century, unheard Chinese ingredients are now appearing in Australian kitchens more regularly. For instance, tofu - a dish that was not accepted in Australia has now been the main ingredient in many dishes served in the country. Tofu was discovered over 2000 years ago by the action of curdling soymilk and pressing those curds into blocks with different textures such as soft, firm and extra-firm. A well-known tofu dish that are normally served in Chinese restaurants around the country is Mapo Tofu. However, on the other hand, some Australian Chinese dishes are actually inspired by Western cuisine, this includes the Wasabi Prawn. This dish was developed by Matthew Chan during a business trip to America ‚ÄúI got the idea from the Hilton‚Äôs San Francisco Grill where they had mustard on roast beef. I tried to do mustard steak but it didn‚Äôt work, so I tried it with prawns.‚Äù In this dish, the prawns are coated with the tangy and creamy English mustard and are served with a side of deep- fried spinach leaves sprinkled with sugar to balance the mustard's sharp and strong flavours. In short, most Chinese restaurants in Australia are designed to be able to cater both Chinese and non-Chinese customers. That being said, there are many items on the menu such as chicken liver, ox tongue, pig uteri and other dishes that can 'frighten' the Western customers. Furthermore, due to the growing population of Chinese people in Australia, there are more and more Australian Chinese restaurants that serve highly authentic tastes, and there is a wider variety of types of Chinese Restaurants. This has included a significant boom in Hong Kong(/Macau) Style Cafes, often serving mixed Cantonese-western dishes with HK-style coffee or tea. Taiwanese restaurants have also significantly increased, especially in the major cities. Restaurants Due to such large popularity, Chinese restaurants can be found in most suburbs and cities of Australia. However, the most concentrated locations of Chinese restaurants in Australia are identified as Chinatowns. Here, the dishes are normally prepared to cater for recent Asian immigrants, tourists as well as Western people with a larger variety of cuisine; including Anhui, Cantonese, Fujian, Shandong, Sichuan and others. Chinese restaurants can also be serving food at different price points; as well as serving both traditional and modern Chinese food. For instance, Chinese restaurants which are found in food-courts normally provide food for customers with shoestring budget. For instance, in Haymarket,Sydney, inside Dixon House, there are many Chinese food stalls that serve affordable Chinese meals. Dixon House, opened in 1982, is one of the most well-known Chinatown food courts. According to Thang Ngo \\"[Dixon House] is still the most Chinese of the Chinatown food courts\\" The place now boasts restaurants such as Oriental Dumpling King and Sizzling and Hot Pot Kitchen, where customers can find meals that range from AU$10 - AU$20. On the other hand, Chinese restaurants can also be very expensive. The Golden Century Seafood Restaurant, located in Sydney Chinatown, has become the symbol for Chinese luxurious dining. The restaurant was established in 1989 and is known for their 'from tank to plate' serving style. This serving style, according to presenter Gus Worland, has provided an assurance for the freshness of the ingredients. Signature dishes such as Braised Lobster with Ginger and Shallot as well as Braised Whole Abalone with Oyster Sauce can cost the customers around AU$300. Moreover, the reason why The Golden Century Seafood Restaurant has become very well-known is that the place has been hosting royalty, politicians and celebrities. For instance, former United States president, George W. Bush has been spotted eating Peking Duck; or well-known celebrities such as Rihanna and Lady Gaga have also been seen to enjoy seafood at the restaurant. Australia also contains authentic restaurants which serves traditional styles as well as restaurants that serves contemporary Chinese cuisine. Authentic Chinese cuisine can be found in Supper Inn Chinese Restaurant. Supper Inn was established in the 1980s; the restaurant is located in the central business district of Melbourne. The food served by Super Inn is described as classic Chinese/Cantonese food: \\"It is such a simple comfort to eat here, [the restaurant] serves quality consistent Cantonese food.\\" Super Inn's signature dishes include chicken congee and BBQ Suckling Pig. These dishes have been around in China for thousands of years. Moreover, the restaurant is also famous for its late night food; the restaurant only decided to close at 2:30 AM - everyday. On the contrary, there are also restaurants that decided to combine the authentic tastes Chinese cuisine with other cuisines around the world to create its own version of contemporary Chinese food. Mr Wong is an example of this. The restaurant was co-created by Dan Hong and Michael Lou. Mr Wong, described by Sydney Morning Herald as a \\"self-contained Chinatown in the middle of Sydney\\". The restaurant offers a customised menu with the utilisation of many foreign ingredients has changed Australian people's perspective on Chinese cuisine. Indeed, xiaolongbao, a type of Chinese steamed bun which usually has a minced pork filling has now been swapped with lobster and scallop. Furthermore, Mr Wong also offers a modern drinks menu with cocktails and house-made ginger beer clearly suggests its effort to change the customers' views on Chinese cuisine. Dishes Chinese dishes that have been adapted to Australian tastes include: * Lemon chicken: consists of pieces of chicken meat that are normally deep- fried and coated with a sticky, sweet and sour lemon-flavoured sauce. Despite its lack of resemblance to authentic Chinese cuisine found in China, lemon chicken is very popular in Australian Chinese restaurants. * Lettuce Wraps: also known as San Choy Bow is a well known Chinese dish where originally pigeon minces were wrapped inside a lettuce leaf. However, in Australia, the pigeon mince has been substituted for mainly pork minces. * Chicken Stir- fried: also known as Chicken Chop Suey; is a dish that consists of stir fried chicken meat in combination with a green vegetable. In Australia, vegetables can also be swapped for carrot, mushrooms and/or bean sprouts. * Chow Sam See: is a dish invented by Matthew Chan. This dish includes shredded chicken, barbecued pork and Chinese mushroom being stir fried and later being served in a thin pancake. Matthew Chan said that this was his effort to recreate Peking Duck with less expensive ingredients. * Mustard Prawns: is a dish inspired by Western cuisine. The main ingredients include prawns, cooking wine, mustard and sweet and sour sauce. * Dim Sim: is developed by Chinese chef William Wing Young around 1945 in Melbourne. Dim Sim is a dumpling with thick (crispy) skin filled with meat and is usually fried.

Disability refers to individuals with physical and intellectual impairments. (Jacobson, 2013) The difference between the disability and impairment is that disability is the restriction of the ability caused by the actual decrement of functioning, aka impairment, of the individual. The Geography of disability studies the experience of disabled people and examines the relationship between the disability and space, ranging from the accessibility, mobility and the landscape, in terms of socio- economic, environmental and political perspectives. Hawkesworth, a scholar refers the Geography of disability as ‚Äúa set of discursive and performative practice‚Äù, which intersects more with in the social and cultural aspects, instead of solely on the physical impairment. According to the world report on disability published by the World Health Organisation, around 15% of the world population, which is approximately 1.14 billion people, lives with a disability, of whom 2-4% experience significant disability. In Europe and America, the disability ratio is one in five people. There are some major factors that give rise to the risk of non-congenital disability, which are age, their living environment, their gender and the access to healthcare. The report had shown that there is a strong correlation between age and the risk of disability, the elder tends to have a higher risk of disability such as Alzheimer and cognitive impairment. There is a global correlation between the disability and poverty due to the short of resources and government investment to medical service, and lack of access to healthcare. Inadequate infrastructure and investment could worsen the condition. In Australia, a research on disability conducted by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Canberra had demonstrated a strong correlation that the more economically disadvantaged area or community people living in, the higher probability of these people will suffer from disability problem or severe disability, justified by the social gradient of disability correlation coefficient. The likelihood of having severe disability of the population who live in the disadvantaged area in Sydney were 2.6% higher than the population who live in the most economically and socially advantaged area in Sydney This correlation could also be seen in the United States. In the US, according to the 2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report conducted by Institute on Disability/UCED of University of New Hampshire, the distribution of people with disabilities aged from 18-64 has concentrated in the Southeast United States, including Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana and Arkansas etc., which are also the most economically disadvantaged area among the state. For example, in Memphis, Tennessee, a city with 26.2% poverty rate is also one of the cities with the densest disabled population, 12.6%-17.8% of its working population (aged from 18-64) live with disabilities. The figures also indicated that female is riskier of being disability than male regardless of their age. In Europe, according to the Eurostat, women are 3% more prone to suffering from a longstanding health problem, daily activity difficulties or both than men in Europe in 2011.  History   Recent development of Geography of Disability:  Geography scholars had been recognizing the issues of disability since the 1930s. The study has then been extended to a range of socio-spatial processes relating to the issue arisen from disability, that interacts among power, space, and society. There were some analyses of disability within the socio-spatial perspectives, though these analyses tended to isolate from each other instead of integrating all ideas together as a critical discourse.https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf It also changed the definition of disability from a medical point of view towards the socio-spatial determinants. Imrie, explained the recent development in The Geographies of Disability as follows: ‚ÄúAn opening observation is that what has emerged, since the mid 1990s, has been a broadening of the substantive focus of studies of space and disability, beyond some of the earlier foci of health, cognition and behaviour, welfare, design, and architecture. In particular, the study of disability is evident in most parts of human geography, and not just confined to a specialist or sub-part of the discipline. However, up to the early 1990s, the study of geography and disability had been the preserve of specific niche areas of research activity, with some scholars, like Park et al (1998), suggesting that human geography had rarely engaged with studies of 7 disability.‚Äô‚Äô The narratives and discursive practices, suggested by Hawkesworth, is also emerged in the geography of disability studies. It has developed to the interrelationships between the body, the feeling of a place and disability, suggested by Imrie, which lead to a wider and deeper scope and the focus of the studies especially regarding to different age groups with different extent and types of disability, for examples, children with learning difficulties vs elderly people.  The socio-economic of disability  The disabled are often seen as the oppressive socialization of a given form of physiological difference, experiencing who suffer the common socially.  The models of disability  (link to an external article: Social Model of disability) The medical model of refers Disability as the physical problem, the incapability of a disabled person to perform as ‚Äònormal‚Äô as a person that has no disability. Disability intrigues a further disclosure on easing the inconvenience and improving a disabled's daily experience. For example, introducing advanced assistive devices or aids like mobile wheelchair for disabled individuals who live on their own. On the other hand, the social model of disability evokes the idea of social integration through demonstrating the difficulties faced by the disabled in the wake of their physical or mental functioning decrement. The social model of disability encourages the mainstream social and cultural structure to accommodate the disabled individuals with more assistive infrastructure and social attitude. In the Geography of disability, the research mainly focuses on discussing the relationships between the disabled, their basic human rights and the social development, as in the inclusion and the marginalization. This was one of the main study to research and approach the disabled's need, address the problem without additional negative effects or embarrassment to the disabled pupils. Many of the disabilities do not have equal access to the resources aka the materiality or the basic human rights aka the non-materiality inequality as ‚Äòthe normal‚Äô population, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. Their weak and limited physical ability led to higher and extreme level of difficulty to make earning and accumulate wealth by their own power as a non-disabled. This, as a result, make it more difficult for them to live out of poverty or economic disadvantage. What's more, discrimination, inequality and social exclusion reflected from the ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô society and thus received by the disabled population in different areas creates a virus circle of the disabled experience. Children and teenagers who has learning difficulties is more likely to cause them a discrimination, getting rejected by the mainstream school. The young disabled population aged 15‚Äì24 are 10 times more prone to receiving discrimination than the elder disabled population aged 65 and over. And it seems to them doomed to be/ inevitably be socially marginalized and excluded. Imrie (2007) further described in his article of how the geographical research methodology is carried out and work well for the social research on disabled people. ‚ÄúHall and Kearns (2001: 243), for example, comment that ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô research methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, ‚Äòcan fail to represent the geographical lives of intellectually disabled people‚Äô (also, see Hall, 2004). Similarly, a project by Kitchin (2000), about the opinions of disabled people about social research, shows that most do not like the use of methods that fail to capture the complexities of disability. Such methods include pre-set questions that collect quantitative data and statistics. These observations suggest that the use of particular qualitative or interpretative methods are a preferred way of giving voice to disabled people's experiences, and open up scope for inclusive research practices. In this respect, there have been some important methodological developments in geographical research that seek to articulate the different ways that disabled people know and experience the world.‚Äú  Environmental politics of Disability   The environmental politics of Disability  A disabled person‚Äôs origin and living environment, including the mobility, accessibility, space, living condition, greatly determine and impact his daily experience, and even affect his physical and mental condition. Space, resources, and investment to be invested in the infrastructure needed by the disabled population are somehow considered to be ‚Äòextra‚Äô, as the mainstream society has neglected, somehow judged and less inclined to put forward about it. One of the aim to be achieved through the geography studies of disability is to highlight the issue and problem the disabled population come across on daily basis so as to create a more including and less-tension society and community.  Accessible Tourism  The concept of the accessible tourism is one of the significant developments derived from the development of the geography of disability. The idea behind the accessible tourism is to strive for a basic human right for the disabled to participate in tourism, and to promote the best accessibility practices in tourism by engaging representatives of international tourism sector as well as the representatives of disabled individuals and also non-governmental parties to cooperate. In the wake of the development of disability researches, along with the awareness of the need of tourists, the concept and the idea of accessible tourism which aim to promote ‚Äòtourism without barriers‚Äô has gradually drawn people's attention as well as the World Tourism Organisation's publication. UNWTO has since published a range of information including Manuals on Accessible Tourism for tourism stakeholders to ensure the quality and quantity of the supply of good accessible tourism practises, and recommendations on Accessible Tourism for people with disabilities. The research results of the geography of disability intrigue a further studies of universe design of space in relation to the mobility and accessibility, and the improvement of the assistive technologies to confront the barriers encountered by the disabled. The geographical model of disability was created during research of the geography of disability. According to Zajadacz, he stated that: ‚ÄúIn recent years, geographers have made significant strides towards understanding the spatially of disability. This research has presented disability as a characteristic of the population that inevitably leads to marginalization and spatial exclusion from otherwise normal social arenas and spaces within the built environment. Geographers claimed that throughout the research on the geography of disability, they connected the cause of disability in terms of social and spatial environment and helped the promotion of more accommodating resolution which ‚Äúprovide access to sites and the full scope of life within society taking different degrees and types of disability into consideration.‚Äù Gaining the idea of disability from the social model of disability and the geographical model of disability, the definition and the attitude towards disability no longer limited only to the physical decrement of an individual, but evolve further to the consideration to disabled's daily experience relating to social and spatial aspects.  Discrimination Law and Policy  In WHO's report about the disabling barriers, it said: ‚ÄúBeliefs and prejudices constitute barriers to education, employment, health care, and social participation. For example, the attitudes of teachers, school administrators, other children, and even family members affect the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools. Misconceptions by employers that people with disabilities are less productive than their non- disabled counterparts, and ignorance about available adjustments to work arrangements limits employment opportunities.‚Äù In Australia, The Disability Discrimination Act 1992(DDA) illegitimate any direct or indirect discrimination towards a person, either temporarily or permanently disabled, or with the future potential of being disabled, in areas including employment, education, access to services and public places and rights to purchase premises.

She was falsely accused of adultery and forced to commit suicide. Xiao Guanyin was described as \\"exceedingly beautiful\\". A sinicized Khitan, she was a pipa virtuoso and wrote songs as well as Chinese poetry. Fourteen of her poems have survived, which have all been translated into English. Biography Xiao Guanyin was the daughter of Xiao Hui and Yel√º Shuogu. Yel√º Shuogu was the daughter of Xiao Noujin and Emperor Shengzong of Liao, and Xiao Hui was the brother of Xiao Noujin - an ambitious woman who was involved in the murder of a former Empress Dowager and a plot to overthrow her son, Emperor Xingzong. Guanyin's name literally means Buddha in Chinese. Xiao Guanyin had an affection for fine arts, and she was a skilled pipa player and music composer. She also wrote several poems and was chosen by Yel√º Hongji as his consort. She gave birth to three daughters, Yel√º Sagezhi (ËÄ∂ÂæãÊííËëõÂè™), Yel√º Jiuli (ËÄ∂ÂæãÁ∫†Èáå), and Yel√º Teli (ËÄ∂ÂæãÁâπÈáå). She later gave birth to a son named Yel√º Jun (ËÄ∂ÂæãÊµö), who would become the Crown Prince. When Yel√º Hongji became Emperor, Xiao Guanyin would receive the title of Empress Yide. The Empress was known to be virtuous and wise. When Yel√º Zhongyuan's wife allured other men, Xiao Guanyin warned her that she was wed to the Emperor's uncle. Despite Xiao Guanyin's beauty, the Emperor distanced from her and she composed several poems out of sadness. https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%90%A7%E8%A7%82%E9%9F%B3 She told a court musician named Zhao Weiyi to play for her and his music was intricate and deliberate. Many servants heard the music and spread rumors that the Empress and Zhao Weiyi had an affair. An official named Yel√º Yixin would later use these rumors to bring the Empress's downfall. In the court, Xiao Guanyin's son the Crown Prince was benevolent and righteous, and was heavily involved in political affairs. A corrupt official named Yel√º Yixin (ËÄ∂Âæã‰πôËæõ) feared the influence Xiao Guanyin had on her son and the Emperor and plotted to have her removed. He conspired with a palace maid named Dancheng (ÂçïÁôª), who feared and despised Xiao Guanyin. Dancheng knew how to play the zither and was one day noticed by the Emperor. However, the Empress told the Emperor that Dancheng was the daughter of a rebel and she would possibly take revenge one day. The Emperor then distanced himself from her, and any signs of taking Dancheng as a concubine disappeared. Dancheng also lost to Zhao Weiyi on an music examination, and blamed this on the Empress's bias towards Zhao Weiyi. She then began to complain to her friend, who was also the mistress of Yel√º Yixin. To revenge herself, Dancheng tricked the empress into writing a love poem, and Yel√º Yixin presented the poem to Emperor Daozong. https://books.google.com/books?id=RUtbDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PT79&lpg;=PT79&dq;=%E5%8D%95%E7%99%BB&source;=bl&ots;=9vtldHf9aQ&sig;=ACfU3U0oFaaJp1cRPc7b0IxpmabjK7b16g&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjZ0Pe96b7qAhUxh- AKHeBqAbgQ6AEwDHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q;=%E5%8D%95%E7%99%BB&f;=falseYel√º Yixin insisted that the poem contained hidden messages that the empress was having an affair with another man. The Emperor believed Yel√º Yixin, and Yel√º Yixin and another official named Zhang Xiaojie subjected Xiao Guanyin and Zhao Weiyi to numerous forms of torture. Dancheng spied on them during this period, but couldn't find any conclusive evidence. They refused to admit they had a love affair but were executed. Her body would be sent back to the Xiao family. Yel√º Yixin then went on to execute the crown prince and any other officials he did not like. Eventually, Emperor Daozong caught on, and began to take away Yel√º Yixin's privileges one by one. Yel√º Yixin then attempted to defect to Song, but was caught in the process; he was finally executed in 1083 AD, but the damage he had done to the empire was already done. Emperor Daozong eventually instigated a new Empress named Xiao Tansi, but she was reduced to the title of Consort Hui. After Tansi's mother tried to seduce the Prince of Yan, Dansi was further reduced to commoner status. Xiao Guanyin's grandson born to Yel√º Jun would later ascend to the throne as Emperor Tianzuo, the last Emperor of the Liao Dynasty. https://baike.baidu.com/reference/1149324/0ad4YDwS6S2tTmbkf0Rxa2USnaVwV1N6dgl_OSEv3KTcmday7NaBzGl81gMbzHgAGEWhwbVcA- IfB3R_Yfbi1KK0B5XWRGhMYTXQWSGq7LInenwBqhcQMXZ4al9kUKI Ancestry Both Xiao Guanyin and Emperor Daozong were Emperor Shengzong's grandchildren and therefore cousins.

He taught in so-called \\"special mathematics\\" classes (preparation for the Grandes √âcoles competitions) and ended his university career in one of the most renowned chairs in higher education, at lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. Like Borodin, his scientific and academic career was coupled with regular music practice. Already in Toulouse in 1924, he conducted a youth symphony with a small university orchestra. He furthered his musical studies, which he completed under the direction of Charles Koechlin. Albert Roussel also encouraged him to compose. From 1936 onwards, an intense production began which was only interrupted by the war. Gou√© was revealed especially with the Psalm XIII (1938) and the Trio (1937). Living permanently in an inner dream, he could seem very dizzy: so he had gone to school one day to teach with shoes of two different pairs. With a very high moral conscience, his personal reactions were always guided by an idealistic point of view. The Second World War broke out as orchestras and ensembles began to pay attention to his production. Mobilized in 1939 as an artillery lieutenant, taken prisoner in June 1940, he spent five years in the Nienburg, Lower Saxony/Weser Oflag. His visceral need to teach was evident from the first days of captivity through a physics course given to his young classmates to help them prepare for their future exams. At the same time, he organized introductory lectures on the history of music from its origins to the present day, to which were added over the months a course on harmony and counterpoint, a course on fugue, twenty lessons on musical aesthetics and the history of the symphony. Demonstrating passionate self- denial, he wanted to complete this theoretical teaching and instil in his companions of misfortune a love of music by conducting and commenting on eighteen symphonic concerts whose programs ranged from Franco-Flemish polyphonists to Arthur Honegger. Both the musicians of the orchestra and the singers of the choir were amateurs, with instruments of very poor quality, but Gou√©'s enthusiasm won them all over. \\"Captivity\\" - he confided in 1942, a year of despair and anguish - \\"removes almost all contact with real life, therefore almost all inner life\\" [...] \\"Frequent solitude is necessary to enrich one's inner life, and all solitude is lacking\\" [...] \\"The hardest thing is not to be hungry; it is to feel one's spiritual level lower\\". Very quickly he started composing again, with difficulty at first, then a little more serenely. As with Olivier Messiaen, the war period saw the emergence of masterpieces, revealing an incomparable mastery and artistic maturity: Psalm CXXIII (1942), Prelude, Choral and Fugue (1943), Prehistory (1943), Quintet for piano and strings (1943), Prelude, Aria and Final (1944), Theme and Variations (1945), 3rd String Quartet (1945), etc. Returning home in May 1945, Gou√© was unable to carry out his dual activity as a musician and teacher at the same time. Very weakened, he participated in the jury of the agr√©gation exams, completed the orchestration of his grandiose Inscription on a stele and died on 10 October 1946 at the university sanatorium of Neufmoutiers-en-Brie. He is buried in the cemetery of Gu√©ret, in the Creuse, whose music conservatory has been named after him since 2007.  Legacy  Following in the footsteps of the Frankish school, opposed to the romantic spirit, Gou√© had a predilection for Bach and Renaissance musicians. He composed P√©nombres (1931), an orchestra suite, a Po√®me Symphonique (1933) and in 1934 a first Symphony as well as a musical action in two acts Wanda, a drama of the sea whose action is located in Saint- Gilles-Croix-de-Vie and which will only be premiered in 1950 in Mulhouse. The colourful dough of his orchestra, as if carved with a chisel, skilfully mixes the instrumental timbres. Starting from ancient fashions, Gou√© considered it necessary for the French temperament, by tradition, to assert tonality, but an expanded tonality going without complex to polymodality. A composer of his time, Gou√© perfectly understood the evolution of musical language and developed his own technique, which he called \\"chromatic simultaneity\\", a variant of polymodality on the same tonic. The infinite resources of contrapuntal writing allowed him a multitude of combinations of subjects. In his quest for perfection, his fascinating theoretical reflections on form extend those of Vincent d'Indy. His temperament as a builder concerned with unity made him prefer the use of a single theme generating the whole work, following Bach's example. Architectural concerns that became more and more imperative in his last opuses (Quintet, 3rd String Quartet, Prelude, Aria and Final...) without stifling lyricism and epic meaning. Because \\"one must not hide the emptiness of thought under the efflorescence of counterpoint\\", his style, by successive stripping, reached its conclusion in captivity. Charles Koechlin rightly characterized him: \\"He is above all a sensitive, a lyrical man. However, he keeps a constant need for order: a Cartesian whose art does not abandon itself to the fantasy of musical improvisation. The monothematic form that he often likes, is extremely voluntary. It is infinitely serious, often harsh, even strange, sometimes quite austere, sometimes tragic too. But on occasion he achieves real beauty (as in the andante of his Sonata for piano and violin). I have already spoken of the emotion that emanates from a Psalm written in captivity. There is no doubt that such an emotion is also evident in many of his other works. He's not an entertainer. He's not even a skillful charmer. There's often something rough about him. But it is a living being, who loves, who suffers, who has mercy. What he leaves behind is significant enough to deserve to escape oblivion.Charles Koechlin, Contrepoints, December 1946. An astonishing encounter with Saint Theresa in the pen of the one who had renounced the Catholic religion of his childhood: \\"I understood that resigning myself to the humble daily tasks puts me in contact with the most essential concerns of Life, and develops in me this gift of generosity that must be cultivated at all costs\\". Gou√© remained tormented to the highest degree by the metaphysical problem. His noble and anxious spirituality gives his works a sincere depth and raises the essential questions. Exacerbated by the experience of the camps, this interiority gives Gou√©'s message its accent of authentic originality. Rough universe where man seeks his way by feeling, anxious by his destiny, but sometimes illuminated by a ray of hope. These concerns are in line with our sad actuality: there is some Rouault in this music, exsanguinated faces, surrounded by black, who shout their despair in a burning world.  Quotes√âmile Gou√©.

After serving in the military, he studied law at Depaul University and became an attorney.  Career  Yoshinaga was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives during Hawaii's Democratic revolution. He then served as a senator from 1955 to 1974. During his tenure, he was especially interested in passing legislation related to labor and healthcare, such as the 1974 Prepaid Health Care Act. Yoshinaga was instrumental in getting the latter passed because he pushed for studies of universal healthcare during the late 1960s. Yoshinaga also had a controversial position on population control: not only was he for legalizing abortion, but he also introduced a bill that would require every woman with more than two children to be sterilized. He started the Commission on Population Stabilization in the 1970s. During protests against Kalama valley's redevelopment, he proposed a bill in which the Senate would buy the land and allow the residents to stay there while researchers studied population growth in the area. Yoshinaga helped to establish the State Foundation on Culture and the Arts. He also supported the ILWU. After retiring in 1974, he was a mentor to Democratic politicians.

After graduating from Beijing Medical College in 1956, he worked at Xiyuan Hospital, which is affiliated with the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (CACMS), and practiced as a paediatrician for 18 years. In 1974, Li began researching on the pharmacology of traditional Chinese medicine. He later served as Director of Basic Medical Research at Xiyuan Hospital, and chief scientist at the CACMS. His research on the scientific basis of the traditional Chinese medical concept of blood stasis won the National Science and Technology Progress Award, First Class. He also pioneered a new procedure to treat coronary artery disease using a combination of Chinese medicine and stem cells, which won the China Medical Society Science and Technology Award, First Class. Li was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 2003. From 2004 to 2009, he served as Dean of the School of Pharmacy of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. On 18 October 2018, Li died in Beijing at the age of 84.  Controversies  In 2008, Li was implicated in an academic scandal at Zhejiang University. A postdoctoral researcher at the School of Pharmacy, He Haibo (), was found to have published 14 articles in international journals that used falsified or plagiarized data, and Li was listed as a co-author. He Haibo admitted wrongdoing and said that he had submitted the articles using Li's name without his permission. An investigation by the university cleared Li of wrongdoing, and He Haibo, by then an associate professor, was fired. Li took personal responsibility for his lax supervision of He, although he said that his busy schedule which required him to spend most of his time in Beijing and his lack of English proficiency impeded his ability to scrutinize He's articles that were written in English. In 2009, Li was involved in a dispute with the Chinese pharmaceutical company Tasly when he claimed that a key product made by Tasly was unsafe. Tasly sued Li in 2013, alleging that Li's claim was baseless and was motivated by his financial and employment relations with Guangzhou Pharmaceutical, a direct competitor of Tasly. In September 2014, the Tianjin High People's Court ruled in favour of Tasly and ordered Li to issue an apology and pay Tasly 300,000 yuan in compensation.

The original image was borrowed by Warhol from a promotional still captured by Gene Kornman and released for the film Niagara (1953) featuring Monroe, raising questions on the extent of artistic appropriation. The cropped and ultimately untouched images have since been recognised as iconic and influential on contemporary art, forming the foundations of what is now known as pop art. Whilst the portfolio is viewed as one entity, each print has been recognised as a stand-alone and is named after the colours in the work, some of which include Orange Marilyn, Lemon Marilyn, and White Marilyn. After the first prints were made in 1967, they were sold by Warhol for as little as $250. However, with his rise in fame, in 1998 Orange Marilyn sold for $17.3 million and more recently, the White Marilyn sold for $41 million.  History/influences  Prior to his success as an artist, Warhol used his degree in pictorial design to be employed as a commercial illustrator in New York City, producing advertisements for Glamour fashion magazine whilst exhibiting his work on a small scale. Warhol soon gained popularity as a commercial artist advertising for prestigious magazines such as New York Times, Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. This exposed him to a circle of many popular figures and encouraged his fascination with celebrities that began when he was a young boy. Whilst he strictly kept his business and personal art pieces separate, his audience-orientated day-job provided him with a backing to manipulate the public's views in Untitled from Marilyn Monroe. In which he immortalises the actress after her death and advertises the star and her fame through her public self. The separation between his art is clear as his commercial work of the 1940-50s period is much lighter due to the addition of ink by hand to drawn images to be then pressed onto a blank surface so the wet lines transfer. Such primitive printing technique exposed Warhol to his later appreciation of flawed repetition. Although majorly influenced by Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, pioneers of the Neo-Dada movement, Warhol embodied the colourful and bold pop-art as the basis of his work, and as a rejection of Jackson Pollock's and Willem de Kooning's abstract expressionism. Pop Art allowed Warhol to challenge the need for originality in art, rather preferring to use photographs as the basis of his work. Instead of focusing on emotion and dramatic action, Pop Art sought to represent the dynamics of the world and be inclusive of the state of objects and society in everyday life. This in combination with mass media production, inspired Warhol's future use of automatic reproduction through silk screening. This technique was employed Warhol at a perfect time when America's gross national products quadrupled in 1960's creating an economy based on consumerism. Referring to the slight disturbances to the uniformity of silk screened prints, Warhol said, \\"I liked the way repetition changes the same image\\", demonstrating this transformations in the 10 Monroe prints, characteristic of the ink messy process. His apparently random assortment of subjects, is a \\"careful selection through elimination\\", of public events or famous figures which convey historic, popular and meaningful connotations. These distinct artistic choices, catalysed his success and recognition, defining him as an artist through these headlined events whilst simultaneously creating an anthology of art pieces that reflect his time. Such endurance was important to Warhol, \\"the idea is not to live forever, it is to create something that will\\". He was successful in this mission by creating a legacy for himself as a pioneer of Pop Art as well as immortalising the subjects of his work.  Marilyn Monroe  260x260px Warhol's most renowned muse was Marilyn Monroe, an enduring sex symbol and Westernised beauty.  The Hollywood legend  Monroe began as a model under her real name Norma Jean Baker. After being scouted whilst working at a military factory, her pale features and blonde hair gained wide recognition and she signed a seven-year contract with Twentieth Century Fox. She appeared in 30 films and was one of the top paid actresses in the 1950s. Her film credits included The Asphalt Jungle, All about Eve and The Seven Year Itch. During this time Niagara (1953) was released. A promotional still from the film and captured by Gene Kornman is the basis of Untitled from Marilyn Monroe. However, not everything was as glamorous as it looked to the viewers, as Monroe often struggled with casting in serious movie roles, due to Hollywood's depiction of her as a vacant and sexualised female.  Her personal life  Throughout her triumphs, Monroe struggled with mental health breakdowns, searching for happiness and love and the pressure to embody the housewife stereotype. It was believed, managing her public life and the seductive yet mysterious \\"Monroe legend\\" began her toxic behaviour of alcohol and drug abuse. In the early 1960s, Monroe's life took a tumultuous turn after pressure to fulfil her contract took its toll, resulting in her death on August 4, 1962, which was ruled a probable suicide. After her death, the media drew attention to complexity of her character and the fa√ßade concealing the true nature of Monroe's insecure and melancholic self.  Analysis  As a pioneer of the Pop Art movement endorsing pop culture and materialism, Warhol rejects Abstract Expressionism celebrating independent art that holds true to consumeristic aesthetic. This was done through borrowing by Warhol from a promotional still of the film Niagara (1953), raising questions on the extent of artistic appropriation. In Untitled from Marilyn Monroe, Warhol deconstructs a film star and her artificial media typecast. Warhol transformed Monroe's ubiquitous typecast as an enduring sex icon and femme fatale into a creative silkscreened print. The borrowing by Warhol from a promotional still raises questions on the extent of artistic appropriation. This objectification of Monroe was possible in a society which valued products and brands over people. His minimal use of detail and heavy outlines exaggerated and maintained Monroe's striking facial features and her sculpted hair through the colourful repetitions, which suggest more to the artwork and the concept of cyclic history. The original still was also cropped by Warhol to bring Monroe's iconic features into focus to exhibit her social status and portray her as being closer to the audience. The detached nature of, and the minor changes among, the ten prints, attributable to the imperfections, smudges and blurriness from the silkscreen technique, emphasise the disconnect between the public and the private Monroe. These small imperfections can also be viewed as Warhol's comment on the rise of mass production in the 1960s. Warhol challenged popular press who chose to expose Monroe's private life through media, by rather featuring her public identity through an art form that closely resembled print media. Monroe strived to keep her privacy, \\"I don't want everybody to see exactly where I live, what my sofa or fireplace looks like... I want to stay just in the fantasy of Everyman\\". Warhol paid tribute to her desires through the prints which drive attention away from her private moments and close in on her beauty and her role as a model and an actress. Warhol's attraction to catastrophic events for use as subject matter is clear in his choice of Monroe as a subject closely after her death in 1962. The event was considered an American tragedy.  Technique  Warhol's style evolved over his career, becoming bolder and more graphic. In 1962, he adopted what would become his trademark, the screen printing technique that defined his works. Warhol said, \\"I started doing silk-screens. I wanted something stronger that gave more of an assembly-line affect\\". Mass replicating images, which attracted him to silk screening, was a precursor to laser printing. Warhol would first mark the surface according to where the colours are to be laid, as silk screening involves the layering of inks, one at a time, using a different frame. He would then place a silk mesh screen on the original and saturate the screen with coloured ink and emulsion using a squeegee. The saturated screen would then be placed on the surface of the print and this process would be repeated for each block of colour. For Untitled from Marilyn Monroe, Warhol used five different mesh screens for each print.  Gerard Malanga  Gerard Malanga, Andy Warhol's silk screening assistant in The Factory Prior to working as Warhol's screen-printing assistant, Gerard Malanga grew up in the Bronx to a very traditional family. Much like Warhol, he studied Graphic and Advertising Design but found more of his passion in poetry which he later came to realise was difficult in bringing financial wealth. Gerard was able to meet Warhol through a mutual poetry friend in 1962, three years after graduating. At the time Gerard did not know who Warhol was and had very little regard for him, \\"I was more interested in the poets\\", however, what he thought was a summer job at an art factory lasted 7 years. For the production of larger works such as Untitled from Marilyn Monroe, Warhol hired 20-year-old Gerard Malanga to aid in him in The Factory between 1963 and 1967, the name being an allegory for his mass production of art. This decision was made based on Malanga's expertise in screen printing, which Warhol lacked at the time, especially with works of larger scale requiring the use of very large screens.  Use of color  Famous for his use of vibrant and bold color, Warhol utilised non-symbolic colors described by himself as \\"artificial\\" in Untitled from Marilyn Monroe. This classification was due to the lack of representation for the colors of the real-life objects. When asked if he ever tried realism in his art, he simply replied, \\"Gee, I don't know how to\\". It was this technique of complementary color assortment, colors found on the opposite sides of the color wheel, which played a part in Warhol's rise to fame. They did so through connotation of the bright, hard-edged colors to the pop-culture aesthetic of that highly commercial and consumeristic period. Each color variation embodies its own tone and mood allowing Warhol to communicate the importance of color in display of emotion even if the subject matter remains the same. The first print, the yellow, green and pink Marilyn, announced the release of the Untitled from Marilyn Monroe, lacked borders and was slightly smaller than the rest. The original portfolio was expanded to an edition of 250, some signed by Warhol.  Critical and commercial reception  The cropped and ultimately untouched images have since been recognised as iconic and influential on contemporary art forming the foundations of what is now known as Pop Art. The impact of him pioneering this movement was in his ability to break down the separation between high-class art such as historic and expressionist, and low-class art, such as commercial and the more mundane. The endurance of the works and the growth in price is attributed to the fact that Warhol's art is still relevant and reflective of today's glamour and the consumer culture. Whilst the portfolio is viewed as one entity, each print has been recognised as a stand-alone and is named after the colours in the work, some of which include, Orange Marilyn, Lemon Marilyn, and White Marilyn. The official names of the works are presented under Untitled 1967. After the first prints were made in 1962, they were sold by Warhol for as little as $250. However, with his rise in fame, in 1998 Orange Marilyn sold for $17.3 million and more recently, the White Marilyn sold for $41 million. Whilst the original silk-screened prints made by hand are worth millions, due to the iconic nature of this work, it is now possible to buy a modernised, computer-printed \\"Marilyn\\" for a much lesser price.

It has its own factory for complete knocked-down vehicles in Wanaherang, Bogor, Indonesia. History The history of Mercedes-Benz in Indonesia began back in 1894, when The Susuhunan of Surakarta bought a Benz- model Phaeton (2000cc, 1 cylinder, 5hp, for eight people). This was also the first car in Indonesia. In 1970, Mercedes-Benz collaborated with Volkswagen to set up a manufacturing line in Tanjung Priok, Jakarta, for the Indonesian market. The manufacturer then named as PT German Motor Manufacturing, with another company named PT Star Motor established as the sole agent for Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Indonesia. The factory in Tanjung Priok then began producing Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicles, which included the legendary Mercedes-Benz 911 trucks. In 1973, the assembly line in Tanjung Priok started producing Mercedes-Benz passenger vehicles. In 1978, the Wanaherang plant established, together with the opening of Apprentice Training Center and After Sales Service in Ciputat. This was followed by the break-up of the cooperation with Volkswagen in 1979. In 1981, the truck production commenced. One year later, in 1982, the Wanaherang plant officially opened. In 1985, PT Star Engines Indonesia was established in Wanaherang. PT German Motor Manufacturing became the first ISO 9001-accredited automotive maker in Indonesia in 1996. It then acquired the PT Star Engines Indonesia in 2000. Following the changing name of its parent's name from Daimler-Benz AG into DaimlerChrysler AG, PT German Motor Manufacturing then changed its name into PT DaimlerChrysler Indonesia in 2000, followed by PT Star Motors Indonesia changed into PT DaimlerChrysler Distribution Indonesia in the same year. After Daimler AG broke up with Chrysler, PT DaimlerChrysler Indonesia changed its name into PT Mercedes-Benz Indonesia. The same happened to PT DaimlerChrysler Distribution Indonesia, which became PT Mercedes-Benz Distribution Indonesia.

Having deposed his brother Muhammad bin Shakhbut Al Nayhan with his father's support, he ruled in his father's name. Under Tahnun, Abu Dhabi became a Trucial State in 1820, eventually becoming the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  Accession  Tahnun acceded after having driven his brother Muhammad into exile with his father Shakhbut's support. It was, in fact, Shakhbut who was signatory to the landmark General Maritime Treaty of 1820 with the British, following the sack of Ras Al Khaimah and bombardment of coastal communities which took place during the punitive British Persian Gulf Campaign of 1819. However, in an 1824 peace agreement with Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi of Sharjah over the forts at Buraimi Oasis, it was Tahnun who signed.  Abu Dhabi attacked  The exiled Sheikh Muhammad bin Shakhbut returned to Abu Dhabi in late 1823, together with a force of Manasir Bedouin and sacked the town. He was driven out, with the loss of 35 men, by Tahnun, who had raced from the interior to meet him. Muhammad made for Sharjah, but was followed by Tahnun and his force and Tahnun demanded Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah hand him over. Sultan was saved the dilemma when Muhammad once again fled into exile.  Buraimi  As Abu Dhabi grew, many of its inhabitants maintained links to the inland oasis town of Buraimi (which would in time be split into Buraimi and the Abu Dhabi city of Al Ain) and Tahnun worked to establish his influence there, brokering a peace between the Na'im of the oasis and their breakaway relatives, the Al Nuami of Ajman and the Al Bu Shamis. A number of interests jostled for Buraimi, including the Sultan of Muscat, the Wahhabis (who had made a number of incursions) and Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah, who had established a number of forts in the oasis. Tahnun commanded the loyalty of many of the Bedouin families in the area ('You will be aware that Dhahirah belongs to us' he told the British in 1839) and established his primacy there when, in 1824, an agreement was forced on Sharjah in which Sultan bin Saqr recognised Tahnun's claim to Buraimi and then demolished the forts he had built there. Tahnun had three sons, Hamdan, Said bin Tahnun Al Nahyan and Saqr.  Death  Mistrusting his brothers Sheikh Khalifa bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan and Sultan bin Shakhbut, Tahnun kept them away from Abu Dhabi but his father persuaded him to let them return. He discovered them plotting to remove him and imprisoned a number of the plotters. This action spurred the conspirators to action and Tahnun was killed by his two brothers in 1833. Khalifa became the next Ruler.

It was designed by engineering staff in the Existing Lines branch of the New South Wales Public Works Department and built in 1879. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The underbridge now forms part of The Goods Line, a pedestrian walkway which runs from Central station to the corner of Sussex and Hay Streets, Sydney.  History  The original rail access to the Darling Harbour area was completed as a single line in September 1855 via a tunnel-like construction called the \\"Darling Harbour Dive\\" ('diving' under George Street). The line crossed over Ultimo Road on a timber beam bridge. This construction was completed before John Whitton arrived in 1856 to become the long-serving Engineer-in-Chief for railways in NSW. Since the line was an existing, operating line, it became the responsibility of the Existing Lines branch, Public Works Department. By the 1870s goods traffic had increased so much that duplication of the line was planned. This work was completed in 1874 and replacing the timber bridge with a wrought-iron girder bridge followed in 1879 under the direction of George Cowdery, Chief Engineer, Existing Lines branch. The arrangement of main girders is unusual. Whereas a double-track bridge conventionally has two outer main girders with cross-girders to carry both tracks, Cowdery's designer chose to use an additional main girder between the tracks such that the bridge looks like two single-track bridges sharing a common centre main girder. It is a triple-girder, plate-web girder bridge. However, the design was inadequate to accommodate the ever-increasing weights of locomotives and rolling stock, so rather than install a new, stronger bridge, the span was reduced by inserting cast-iron columns on the kerb lines of Ultimo Road. The line continued to be the main access to Darling Harbour but frequent traffic congestion at the Cleveland Street tunnel led to the building of the Metropolitan Goods Lines network, which reached the northern end of Darling Harbour in 1922 (hence much less traffic used the Darling Harbour Dive). Sixty years later the Darling Harbour Goods Yard was closed and the area underwent a major redevelopment. The northern railway was made available to the light railway and the southern connection was reverted to a single line to give access to the Powerhouse Museum. The 1879 wrought-iron girder bridge has continued in service throughout these changes. The bridge is no longer in use, having been closed to service in .  Description  Pedestrians walk along the bridge as part of The Goods Line. The 1879 underbridge over Ultimo Road consists of cast-iron columns supporting wrought iron riveted plate web girders and wrought iron cross beams. Structurally it is a half-through, triple-girder bridge, the centre girder is located between the two tracks. Brick abutments are located on the north and south side of Ultimo Road and add extra support to the underbridge. Originally a single span of , cast iron columns were added on the kerb lines to give three spans, over each footpath and a centre span of .  Condition  Moderate condition with rust appearing on column heads and on underside cross beams and girders. The running surface and tracks have been covered with a steel cover plate which is rusted through in places. There is some graffiti on the plate web girder. On 8 January 2012 the underbridge was assessed as being in a moderate condition with rust appearing on column heads and on underside cross beams and girders. The running surface and tracks have been covered with a steel cover plate which is rusted through in places. There is some graffiti on the plate web girder.LEP On 31 March 2010 a structural assessment was undertaken to advise whether the bridge can be used for pedestrian and cycle use. The conclusion is that this is possible providing the existing deteriorated deck is replaced by one of lightweight construction and that the public are not allowed on the eastern side of the bridge whilst the western side is being trafficked by locomotives. The Roads and Traffic Authority advised that safety screens which help prevent objects being dropped onto traffic below, will be required for the bridge and various arrangements of these are suggested. The high voltage cables will need to be protected, at present their protection is insufficient for areas subject to public access. Godden Mackay Logan have provided heritage advice which has guided recommendations.Taylor Thomson Whitting (NSW) P/L, 2010, 3. Much of the original 1879 fabric exists including the cast-iron columns which changed the structure from a single-span to a triple-span bridge.  Modifications and dates  *: The span was reduced so as to be able to carry heavier rail traffic by inserting cast-iron columns on the kerb lines of Ultimo Road. *: The line was closed to regular traffic *2005: steel cover plates put over remaining track and running surface when it was closed to all traffic.  Heritage listing  As at 9 November 2010, the Ultimo Road underbridge has state significance as the oldest remaining wrought-iron underbridge and a rare triple-girder, plate-web girder bridge on the NSW Railway system. It is a tangible remaining piece of the earliest goods line structures on the NSW railway system and a longstanding piece of the industrial fabric of the Ultimo area. The 1874 bridge represents the first phase of duplication on the NSW system to accommodate increased traffic and increasing adaptation and development to cope with growing loads of larger trains in the early twentieth century as represented by the addition of cast iron columns in 1900. Ultimo Road Railway Underbridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Ultimo Road railway underbridge is historically significant at a state level for its association with the history of the Darling Harbour area for 120 years. It formed an integral part of the oldest line in NSW (opened the same day as the first passenger line) and is a rare example of a triple-girder wrought-iron bridge on the NSW system. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Ultimo Road underbridge is associated with the first major upgrade of rail infrastructure in the 1870s and the transition from timber bridges to iron bridges. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Ultimo Road underbridge has aesthetic significance as a distinctive landmark feature across Ultimo Road. Its wrought-iron columns are fine examples of nineteenth-century decorative ironwork for an industrial structure. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge is technically unusual and interesting as a wrought-iron, triple-girder, plate-web underbridge. It is the oldest plate-web girder in the New South Wales railway system. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge appears to be the only surviving wrought-iron triple-girder structure on the NSW system.

In 2018 the Wagners were inducted in the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame.  History  Henry Wagner, a grandson of John Henry Wagner, eventually acquired control, expanded to include concreting, and in 1989 formed a partnership with three of his sons John, Denis, and Neill. Later, a fourth son Joe, joined and became an equal partner in the business which has achieved regional, national and international distinction. From 1989, the business expanded rapidly from one concrete plant to 19 within 20 years and a work force of 1,100. Diversification led the business into pre-cast concrete, re-enforcing steel, ground-breaking building products and major construction and infrastructure projects both at home and abroad, including in sub-zero temperatures in Sakhalin, Russia. In Australia, the business thrived in a range of diverse construction and infrastructure related activities. Wagners developed fibre technology products and their \\"earth friendly\\" concrete. In 2017, Wagers successfully listed its building materials and mining services operations on the Australian Stock Exchange. Approach to the passenger terminal, Brisbane West Wellcamp Airport, 2016 The Wagner family established Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport, the first public airport to be constructed in Australia in 50 years, built entirely with private money and completed in less than 20 months. Built, owned and operated by the Wagner family, the airport is a regional and interstate passenger facility with major airlines and is a hub for the export of regional produce to China via a weekly 747 service.  Company values  A key to their success has been a commitment to resolve all differences face-to- face in the boardroom. Common sense, shared vision and team work characterise their partnership ensuring that no vote has ever been required to deal with a crucial issue or decision. The Wagner brothers strongly embrace the values of their parents Henry and Mary, namely honesty and fair dealing in their business activities and a commitment to improving communities in which they operate.  Defamation case against Alan Jones  Following the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods, radio host Alan Jones made a series of on-air allegations against the Wagners accusing them of being responsible for the deaths of 12 people during the floods following the collapse of a wall in a quarry they owned. The Wagners commenced a defamation action, which resulted in a 2018 judgment that Jones and the radio stations that broadcast him were ordered to pay $3.7 million in damages to the Wagner family.  Wellcamp Entertainment Precinct  In October 2020, Wagners announced they were planning to build an entertainment precinct at Wellcamp at a cost of $175 million project. The precinct will have motorsport facilities and performing arts venue capable of seating 40,000 people. The Queensland Government has committed $40 million towards the project.

Overview The show consists of two acts, set apart by their musical content. Act 1 starts with three songs from Cr√™uza de m√§ (the title track and, notably, the only two songs on the album which are not about Genoa), then De Andr√© goes on to perform the Anime salve album in its entirety and in order. Act 2, after an interlude by De Andr√©'s firstborn son Cristiano, starts with five songs from La buona novella, after which De Andr√© performs a selection of his most popular songs, also including \\"Geordie\\" as a bonus. The show also features lengthy and detailed spoken introductions by De Andr√© about the main three albums that the setlist is taken from. (On the DVD, two of these introductions are edited out of the main feature and presented as bonuses, as described above.) Because of the higher prominence given to past material, De Andr√©'s second-to-last album Le nuvole is completely absent from the setlist of the show; \\"Don Raffa√©\\", the most easily accessible track from that album and arguably its \\"greatest hit\\", was included in the setlist for the first leg of the 1997 tour, but, according to a comment by De Andr√© in the \\"Backstage\\" bonus feature, it was later dropped from the winter 1997 setlist and throughout 1998 in favour of \\"Bocca di Rosa\\" - which holds an even larger popularity among De Andr√©'s fan base. Differences between live and studio versions Several songs in the show were modified from their studio versions, either to compensate for the absence of musicians and performers who were featured on the respective studio albums, or for purely musical reasons.  Act 1  *On \\"Cr√™uza de m√§\\", De Andr√© appears not to sing at all during the eh anda (etc.) chorus, as he moves away from the microphone while the band members sing. However, he does play a bouzouki - unlike on the original studio album, where he did not play any instruments. *On \\"Jamin-a\\", he adds an oud part. *On \\"Sid√∫n\\", he sits cross-legged on the stage floor and does not play. Again, his voice is not heard during the wordless vocalization section in the song. *\\"Prin√ßesa\\" starts with a few guitar notes and a tapped count-in, in order to help De Andr√© start the song with its a cappella opening line. *On \\"Khorakhan√©\\", after the first verse and in the middle of the fifth, drummer Ellade Bandini plays six short hits on a very small (5-inch) frame drum, in order to momentarily underline the slow waltz beat of the song. The same sound is also featured on the studio recording, but the instrument is not: indeed, as originally recorded, the sound belongs to a sample of a darbuka (originally played by percussionist Naco), added in post-production as a sound effect. The lyrical ending to the song is sung by De Andr√©'s daughter Luvi, who takes her mother's place. *\\"Anime salve\\" and, later, \\"√Ç c√∫mba\\" feature Cristiano De Andr√© singing Ivano Fossati's parts from the original album. *On \\"Dolcenera\\", De Andr√©'s classical guitar (which was the primary marker of the tarantella beat in the song, in its studio recording) is mixed lower than the other instruments; prominence is given instead to Michele Ascolese's charango, which he uses to play an adaption of Cecilia Chailly's Paraguayan harp part on the studio version. Also, the concluding lines of each half-verse, which are all featured as run-on lines on the studio version by means of editing, are sung separately by De Andr√©, who omits the repeated final word of each such line. (e.g. \\"Nera che non si vedeva da una vita intera, cos√¨ dolcenera, nera\\" [\\"So black that you haven't seen it for a whole lifetime, so sweetblack, black\\"] ‚Äì the word nera at the end of the line is omitted from the live performance.)During a 2012 tribute concert broadcast by RAI from Cagliari, Sardinia, Apulian singer-songwriter Dolcenera, who took her stage name from the song, performed it live as a duet with Francesco Di Giacomo from Banco del Mutuo Soccorso; Dolcenera sang the verses, while Di Giacomo did his own powerful, prog-flavored take on the melodic choruses, singing the last one along with his stage partner before dancing with her. While singing the verses, Dolcenera managed not to omit any of the words featured in the studio version. *On \\"Le acciughe fanno il pallone\\", the percussion tag at the end is much more prominent than on the studio version. *On \\"Disamistade\\", percussionist Rosario Jermano plays the berimbau with a metal stick and a bottleneck slide, to change its pitch. The orchestration on the song, played by an actual chamber orchestra on the studio recording, is performed here on a synth by Mark Harris. *On \\"Ho visto Nina volare\\", backing vocalist Danila Satragno plays caxixi and castanets, both of which were played by De Andr√© on the studio version. *The calm orchestral passage which concludes \\"Smisurata preghiera\\" is, again, played on keyboards.  Act 2  *During his interlude, Cristiano De Andr√© performs his solo numbers on his own, with an acoustic guitar and no band ‚Äì except for a short solo on \\"Invincibili\\" by guitarist Giorgio Cordini. *All songs from La buona novella, except for \\"Il testamento di Tito\\" (noted below), are played as very faithful live renditions of their studio counterparts. De Andr√© omits the spoken narration between songs and plays classical guitar throughout. He also sings the choral part in \\"L'infanzia di Maria\\" together with the band, although, as he did earlier in the show, he keeps himself slightly off-mic. *On \\"Il ritorno di Giuseppe\\", the sitar part, originally performed on an actual sitar by Franco Mussida, is played by Cristiano De Andr√© on an electric sitar. *\\"Il testamento di Tito\\" uses a rock arrangement, originally devised by Premiata Forneria Marconi, or PFM, for their successful 1979 tour with De Andr√©. Five more songs in the show (\\"Bocca di Rosa\\", \\"Amico fragile\\", \\"Il pescatore\\", \\"Via del Campo\\" and \\"Volta la carta\\") also use PFM's arrangements from the same tour. *\\"La citt√† vecchia\\" was arranged by Cristiano De Andr√© especially for this tour.As told by Cristiano De Andr√© in the \\"Backstage\\" feature on the DVD. The new arrangement eschews the ballroom-like mazurka beat of the original recording (although an accordion is still featured, played by Harris), and instead opts for a more jazz-oriented feel, with acoustic guitar, brushed drums and a plucked double bass. *On \\"Fiume Sand Creek\\", ethnologist Mario Arcari plays an imitation of a hoopoe's call on ocarina. This part was played by Cristiano De Andr√© on the original studio recording, reportedly by whistling into his cupped hands. *On \\"Il pescatore\\", similarly to the other choral parts in the show, De Andr√© moves away from the microphone during the \\"la-la-la\\" chorus, in order for his voice not to be heard loudly. *One of PFM's instrumental melodies on \\"Via del Campo\\", originally played by Franco Mussida on one of his \\"treated\\" guitars, is here played on flute by vocalist Laura De Luca. In this live rendition, the rhythm track is notably more prominent than in PFM's 1979 version; the song is built on a tempo at about 58 BPM, played with brushes by Bandini on a wooden box, and punctuated by Jermano on an udu and a tabla. *On \\"Geordie\\", Luvi De Andr√© sings the female vocal part as a duet with her father. As Luvi revealed in the \\"Backstage\\" feature on the DVD, the song was included in the setlist in select shows to showcase her vocal talents ‚Äì in spite of it being not as popular as the other \\"hits\\" included in the second act.\\"Backstage\\" feature on the DVD. *On \\"Volta la carta\\", the high operatic note at the end (originally sung by a tenor), which was omitted from previous live performances, is back in ‚Äì sung at the top of his voice by Harris. Personnel The show features almost all of the musicians who played on Anime salve, most of which are regular members of De Andr√©'s live backing band since 1991. The band also includes American-born keyboardist Mark Harris (who was a stable band member during the first half of the 1980s, but was later dismissed), Neapolitan session percussionist Rosario Jermano (replacing Giuseppe \\"Naco\\" Bonaccorso, who played on the album and was tragically killed in a 1996 car crash) and both of De Andr√©'s children ‚Äì multi-instrumentalist Cristiano on violin, guitars and keyboards, and Luisa Vittoria, nicknamed \\"Luvi\\", as a female vocalist.All personnel credits taken from DVD booklet.

The backdrop was conceived and designed by Pepi Morgia, while graphic artist Paola Salvi (who previously painted the \\"perfect fakes\\" - i.e. faithful copies of famous paintings from various eras - for De Andr√©'s 1992-93 tour) painted the actual pictures. As Morgia himself revealed in his 2009 photographic and textual memoir Tourbook, the design was inspired by a comment made to him by De Andr√© during the very fragmentary rehearsals for the show; according to the singer- songwriter, the entire show was like a house of cards, which was constantly on the verge of falling down, but, thanks to the musicians' talent, never actually did. He also compared the very ephemeral nature of a house of cards to the frailty of his own life. Morgia's first idea for the cards involved a traditional Neapolitan playing deck, but he changed his mind after Cristiano De Andr√© showed him the illustrations from a Marseilles deck which he had, and which Morgia deemed more visually interesting to look at; later on, some elements from the Rider-Waite deck were incorporated as well. Neither Morgia nor anybody else is credited for the set design, as, indeed, both the liner notes and the on-screen credits at the end of the DVD do not include any credits for \\"set design\\". The photo book included with the 16-CD live anthology box set Fabrizio De Andr√©: I concerti [i.e. The concerts], released in 2012 by Sony Music, features four pages which include blueprints of the stage, clearly signed \\"Pepi Morgia\\" (detailing the locations of all the Tarot cards featured on stage), as well as De Andr√©'s handwritten comments on the symbolic significance of the \\"house of cards\\" design.I concerti box set photo book, pages 174-175 and cardboard trays for CDs 15 and 16.

The property is owned by Trustees of the Museum of Applied Arts and Science, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The peninsula of /Ultimo was, by 1818, consolidated as two major landholdings, with the Ultimo area owned by Surgeon John Harris, who built the large residence Ultimo House at the southern end of his property. The land passed to his two brothers in a complicated bequest which made subdivision impractical until the property passed to the next generation of heirs in 1856. Ultimo was largely leased as farmland until this time, but when residential subdivision occurred the building and occupation of houses was rapid. The Harris family built housing both for sale and for tenancy and a number of industrial concerns also became established in the area. Pyrmont was already a thriving industrial and residential area by the middle of the century. The 1880s brought the first woolstores to Ultimo, the 1890s ushered in the Tramway Power House and, by the turn of the century, with the population of the peninsula at its peak, large blocks of housing were being purchased for replacement by the massive woolstores which came to dominate the area in the twentieth century. As these and the associated wharves and railyards declined in activity after World War II, Ultimo's population declined further and by the 1980s, redevelopment of the former industrial sites for office, commercial and residential purposes became the most visible activity of the area. Designed by the Public Works Department's Government Architect's Branch under Walter Liberty Vernon in 1900, the post office was built in 1901. Contractor was G. W. Brewer of and the cost of construction was just over A‚Ç§808. The building opened on 16 July 1901. It operated until the 1980s when it was converted to a childcare centre. Description The former Ultimo Post Office is a single storey brick building with ashlar and moulded stone dressings and a slate clad roof. The Harris Street (western) end has a parapeted gable which has stone coping finishing in segmental shoulders and topped with a frustum apex stone. On the gable there is a quarry faced frieze above a chink with a stone sill. At the eastern end the roof is of gabled hip form. Windows are mainly double hung sashes with highlights above. A major feature is the stone, arched entry porch on the corner. It is double faceted and has ornate impost mouldings and archivolts. Above the corner is an embellished cartouche. The eastern section of the building (lower than the post office due to the falling ground) was originally the postmaster's residence. The former entrance here is flanked by oculi each with stone reveal and label mould. This elevation continues easterly as a stepped brick wall (with stone coping) to the back yard. A corbelled chimney with two pots rises from the roof of the building. The building reflects aspects of both Federation Classical and Federation Romanesque design, elements of the latter being the parapeted gable, the large semicircular opening in the porch and the building's simple massing. The former post office is located on a major intersection in Ultimo and with its styling it forms an important element in the streetscape. Further it emphasises the large scale of the former Power House (now the Power House Museum) behind.  Heritage listing  Ultimo Post Office, Sydney. (May 2020) Ultimo Post Office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The former Ultimo Post Office, built in 1901, is historically significant for its associations with the development of Ultimo/Pyrmont as a predominantly industrial and warehouse precinct by the turn of the century. Construction of the post office helps to reflect the degree of development and consolidation by that time. The building reflects characteristics of Federation Classical and Federation Romanesque architectural styles and is important for its connection with NSW Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon. Owing to its styling and its location on a major intersection, the former post office is an important element in the Ultimo streetscape. Further, it emphasises the scale of the former Ultimo Power Station (now the Powerhouse Museum) behind.

Pierre Pigneau de Behaine, a French Catholic priest, was allowed to preach in H√† Ti√™n. According to Vietnamese source, in 1739, a Cambodian army led by \\"N·∫∑c B·ªìn\\" invaded H√† Ti√™n, but was utterly defeated by T·ª©. From then on, Cambodia did not try to resume H√† Ti√™n. Though no Cambodian chronicle recorded this affair, T·ª©'s victory was highly significant since it allowed H√† Ti√™n to enjoy full independence from Cambodia thereafter. In 1756, the Cambodian king Chey Chettha VII (N·∫∑c Ong Nguy√™n) died. Thommo Reachea IV (N·∫∑c √îng Y·∫øm) succeeded the throne, but soon was murdered and usurped by Ang Hing (, N·∫∑c Hinh). A Cambodian prince, Ang Ton (N·∫∑c √îng T√¥n), fled to H√† Ti√™n. In there, Ang Ton became M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª©'s adopted son. T·ª© escorted Ang Ton back to Cambodia, and crowned him the new king as Outey II. In return, Outey ceded H∆∞∆°ng √öc (mordern Sihanoukville), C·∫ßn B·ªôt (Kampot), Tr·ª±c S√¢m (Chhouk), S√†i M·∫°t (Banteay Meas) and Linh Qu·ª≥nh (Kiri Vong) to H√† Ti√™n.Vi·ªát Nam s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c, Quy·ªÉn 2, T·ª± ch·ªß th·ªùi ƒë·∫°i, Ch∆∞∆°ng 6 After War of the second fall of Ayutthaya, M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª© hid Siamese prince Chao Chui (, Chi√™u Th√∫y). Chao Chui was a son of Prince Aphai, and also a grandson of king Thai Sa. After Taksin crowned the new king of Siam, Chao Chui was regarded as a big threat by Taksin. Taksin tried to persuade M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª© to hand over Chao Chui, but was rejected. Instead, T·ª© tried to install Chao Chui as the new Siamese king. In 1769, a H√† Ti√™n navy under Tr·∫ßn H·∫ßu (Tr·∫ßn ƒê·∫°i L·ª±c) was sent to attack Chantaburi.V≈© Th·∫ø Dinh, H√† Ti√™n tr·∫•n Hi·ªáp tr·∫•n M·∫°c th·ªã gia ph·∫£, b·∫£n A.39, Th∆∞ vi·ªán H√°n N√¥m, H√† N·ªôi, t·ªù 8a-8b. Taksin appointed Chiam (Tang Lieng or Tr·∫ßn Li√™n, Khun Phiphit Wathi), a Teochiu chief of the Chinese junk fleet, as the new vice-governor of Trat with the title Phraya Phiphit. H√† Ti√™n navy was defeated by Phraya Phiphit, and had to retreat. Another incident increased the contradictions between M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª© and Taksin. After the defeat of Konbaung Burma, Taksin sent a tributary mission to Qing China to require the royal seal, claiming that the throne of Ayutthaya Kingdom had come to an end. However, T·ª© reported to Chinese Qianlong Emperor that Taksin was a usurper.Eric Tagliacozzo, Wen-chin Chang, Chinese Circulations: Capital, Commodities, and Networks in Southeast Asia, p. 151 Qianlong rejected Taksin's request, and ordered Taksin to install Prince Chao Chui. Taksin was getting more and more irritated at T·ª©'s actions. In 1771, Siamese army led by Taksin and Phraya Phiphit landed at Kampong Som (present-day Sihanoukville) and Kampot, then besieged and captured H√† Ti√™n. T·ª© had to flee to Gia ƒê·ªãnh (modern Ho Chi Minh City) and seek refuge for Nguy·ªÖn lord. Taksin appointed Tang Lieng as the governor of H√† Ti√™n. Two years later, with the help of Nguy·ªÖn lord, T·ª© returned to H√† Ti√™n. In 1775, Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Thu·∫ßn was defeated by T√¢y S∆°n army and fled south. T·ª© led troops to support him. Thu·∫ßn was captured and executed by T√¢y S∆°n rebel general Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá in 1777. Hu·ªá tried to persuade him to surrender, but was rejected. T·ª© fled to Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc then to Siam. T√¥n Th·∫•t Xu√¢n, a mandarin of Nguy·ªÖn lord, also fled to Siam for support. In Thonburi, they were warmly welcome by King Taksin. Taksin also asked T·ª© to bury their past misunderstandings. T·ª© was awarded the Siamese rank and title Phraya Rachasethi Yuan (, lit. \\"Phraya Rachasethi the Vietnamese\\"), Siamese Melting Pot by Edward Van Roy using the word \\"Yuan\\" () to distinguish with the former governor Tang Lieng (Phraya Rachasethi Chin). Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh ascended the lord throne in 1780. √Ånh sent envoys to Siam in order to seek alliance with Siam. In the same time, a Siamese merchant ship was looted by ƒê·ªó Thanh Nh∆°n, an important military commander of Nguy·ªÖn lord. According to Vietnamese records, taking this opportunity, Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá forged a letter from √Ånh to T·ª©, and sent it to Taksin. In the letter, √Ånh planned to raid Thonburi, and ordered T·ª© and T√¥n Th·∫•t Xu√¢n to help him on the inside. Taksin was taken in, and threw M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª© into prison. However, Thai record stated that M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª© planned to flee back to H√† Ti√™n, but was exposed, so Taksin arrested him. T·ª© committed suicide in prison. Two of his sons, M·∫°c T·ª≠ Ho√†ng and M·∫°c T·ª≠ Dung, were executed together with T√¥n Th·∫•t Xu√¢n and envoys of Nguy·ªÖn lord. Three other sons, M·∫°c T·ª≠ Sinh, M·∫°c T·ª≠ Tu·∫•n and M·∫°c T·ª≠ Thi√™m, were rescued by Kalahom (Pok) and hid in countryside. After King Rama I ascended the Siamese throne, they were allowed to live in Bangkok. Later, Sinh became new ruler of H√† Ti√™n. In 1789, M·∫°c C√¥ng B√≠nh, a son of M·∫°c T·ª≠ Ho√†ng, brought his body back to Vietnam, and buried in H√† Ti√™n.H√† Ti√™n tr·∫•n Hi·ªáp tr·∫•n M·∫°c th·ªã gia ph·∫£ Family M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª© had a large number of offsprings, including: *Sons: ** M·∫°c T·ª≠ Ho√†ng (ÈÑöÂ≠êÊΩ¢), heir apparent, born to principal wife Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã ** M·∫°c T·ª≠ Dung (ÈÑöÂ≠êÊ∫∂) or M·∫°c T·ª≠ Duy√™n (ÈÑöÂ≠êÊ≤ø), born to principal wife Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã ** M·∫°c T·ª≠ Th·∫£ng (ÈÑöÂ≠êÊ∑å), born to principal wife Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã ** M·∫°c T·ª≠ Sinh (ÈÑöÂ≠êÊ≥©) or M·∫°c T·ª≠ Sanh, born to a concubine ** M·∫°c T·ª≠ Tu·∫•n (ÈÑöÂ≠êÊµö), born to a concubine ** M·∫°c T·ª≠ Thi√™m (ÈÑöÂ≠êÊ∑ª), born to a concubine *Daughters: ** M·∫°c Th·ªã Long (ÈÑöÊ∞èÈöÜ), born to principal wife Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã ** M·∫°c Th·ªã Hai (ÈÑöÊ∞èÂíç), born to principal wife Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã ** M·∫°c Th·ªã Gi√°c (ÈÑöÊ∞èÁÅö), born to principal wife Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Notes Sources   Category:1700 births Category:1780 deaths Category:Hoa people Category:Minh H∆∞∆°ng Category:Rulers of H√† Ti√™n Category:Generals of the Nguy·ªÖn lords Category:Vietnamese people of Chinese descent Category:Suicides in Vietnam ","title":"M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª©"},{"id":"58856184","text":"Igor Bandoviƒá (Serbian: –ò–≥–æ—Ä –ë–∞–Ω–¥–æ–≤–∏—õ; born on 27 January 1977, U≈æice, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) is a Serbian jurist and Director of Belgrade Centre for Security Policy.

Aelita (synth.) sound example Aelita (synth.) sound examples Aelita (synth.) sound examples Aelita (synth.) sound examples Aelita (synth.) sound examples Sometimes referred to as the Murom Aelita, the Aelita is a monophonic analog synthesizer manufactured in the Soviet Union in the 1980s.  History  Manufacturing started in 1980 at the Murom radio plant. The electronics was revised in 1986, but the features remained the same.  Features   Physical features  Although its design seems inspired from American and Japanese synthesizers of the previous decade, with a dark aluminum body and near vertical control panel, the Aelita's looks are distinctive in the details. They feature large colored plastic sliders instead of the more common rotary dials, and round or rounded push-buttons instead of flip or rotary switches. The vertical sliders are oriented so that their maximum labelled value is at the bottom, instead of the top as is more common. A sole red LED lights up when the instrument is on. Its hinge-mounted upper control panel can be shut like a piano keyboard's lid, thus protecting the buttons and sliders and preventing accidental settings changes during transportation, and changing the general shape of the instrument to one that is not playable but more transportable. The keyboard is 3.5 octaves wide and made of 44 unweighted, full-sized plastic keys ranging from F to C. All controls are labelled in Russian, using Cyrillic script.  Functional features  The Aelita has 3 oscillators, each with 3 fixed waveshapes (Saw, Pulse and Square), plus a 4th oscillator only active in unison mode, amplitude cross-modulation, a low-pass filter with resonance, one LFO and two envelope generators, all arranged in a fixed architecture typical of subtractive synthesis. It has a maximum range of 7.5 octaves. It is monophonic, meaning that it can play only one note at a time (although detuning of each oscillator makes it possible to play fixed intervals or chords instead of notes). It has two special modes: the unison mode creates an unison-like effect on each oscillator (reducing the range as a tradeoff), and the strings mode creates a vibrato-like effect independent of the LFO. Although of a sturdier construction, it lacks several features commonly found on American and Japanese brand synthesizers at the time, such as : velocity response, portamento, pitch and modulation wheels or levers, settings memory, and (from late 1982 on) MIDI implementation. Its output is monaural.  Sonic character  Its sonic qualities have been consistently qualified as \\"fat\\". Other reviewers also call them \\"impressive\\", and sometimes \\"aggressive\\". There is audible background noise at the output, resembling oscillator bleed.

Other parties, especially the all-powerful Azpeitian Integrists,the Integrists totally dominated the Azpeitia district when it comes to the Cortes elections; from 1891 to 1923 they won almost all mandates available, compare here refrained from fielding own candidates; perhaps Elorza's nomination was sort of a tribute to his late father. He was declared victorious according to the notorious Article 29.El Eco de Navarra 13.06.11, available here Elorza's first years in the Gipuzkoan self-government were not punctuated by noteworthy events; he remained in the shadow of the provincial Carlist jef√© and the Diputaci√≥n president at the same time, marquis of Valde-Espina, and strictly followed his lead, e.g. when in 1912 dealing with apparent incompetence of some deputies.Pedro Berriochoa Azc√°rate, 1911: Incompatibilidades burocr√°ticas sobre fondo caciquil en la Diputaci√≥n de Gipuzkoa, [in:] Historia Contempor√°nea 40 (2010), pp. 61-62 Re-elected as a Carlist candidate in 1913La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 10.03.13, available here he gradually assumed more active stance; scholars note that together with other newcomers in the Diputaci√≥n, Ignacio P√©rez-Arregui and Jos√© de Orueta, he provided an impulse directing the body towards the Basque question.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 122 Following another re-election in 1916Guia Oficial de Espa√±a 1916, available here he was already heavily engaged in negotiations with the Madrid government, playing key role in discussions on renewal of the periodical provincial Concierto Econ√≥mico agreement.La Libertad 04.11.16, available here Elorza, 1919 In 1917 Elorza took part in Asamblea de Vitoria, a joint session of Gipuzkoan, Biscay and Alavese provincial deputies; impressed by emergence of the Catalan Mancomunitat, they voiced for separate Basque establishments. Their vague statement advanced 2 options, re-introduction of foral laws scrapped in course of the 19th century as the preferred one or introduction of regional autonomy as the backup solution.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 170 Elorza enthusiastically contributed to the message;Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, pp. 101-105 present-day scholars count him as ‚Äúuno de los l√≠deres del movimiento auton√≥mico de 1917-1919‚ÄùEstorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 152 and representative of ‚Äúautonomismo guipuzcoano‚Äù, the current which focused on separate provincial regulations.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 104 Though all his life averse to taking part in public rallies, Elorza was even noted promoting the concept at local municipal gatherings, e.g. in Tolosa.one scholar names Elorza ‚Äúthe man of the day‚Äù when discussing a 1917 pro- autonomous rally in Tolosa, V√≠ctor Manuel Arbeloa, Navarra y los estatutos de autonom√≠a (1931-1932), Madrid 2015, , p. 24 Following his increasingly active stance he was gaining recognition among fellow deputies; in 1918 he was already vice-president of Comisi√≥n Provincial.Guia Oficial de Espa√±a 1918, available here In May 1919 he ascended to the highest Gipuzkoan job and replaced Valde-Espina as president of Diputaci√≥n.Larrinaga 2013, p. 138 SEV president, early years I. Congreso de Estudios Vascos As member of Gipuzkoan Diputaci√≥n Elorza hugely contributed to organization of the 1918 Primer Congreso de Estudios Vascos in O√±ati,Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 129 a Basque cultural and scientific initiative; he tried to shape it in line with ‚Äúold Carlist foralism\\".‚Äúviejo foralismo de ra√≠z carlista‚Äù, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 121 The Congress turned a great success and gave rise to Sociedad de Estudios Vascos, later to be known by its Basque name as Eusko Ikaskuntza. Each of 4 vasco-navarrese provincial diputations was entitled to 1 seat in the SEV's Comisi√≥n Ejecutiva; Elorza was nominated the representative of Gipuzkoa.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 129 In 1919 and in recognition of his contribution, though also with a view to his political position as head of the Gipuzkoan self-government, members of the Comisi√≥n elected him the president of SEV.technically Elorza became the president of SEV‚Äôs Junta Permanente, El Debate 09.02.19, available here. All functions in Sociedad were unpaid except this of Secretario General, Idioia Estorn√©s Zubizarreta, La Sociedad de Estudios Vascos. Aportaci√≥n de Eusko Ikaskuntza a la Cultura Vasca, Donostia 1983, , p. 38. The honorary president of SEV was Artur Campi√≥n, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1983, p. 35 He assumed the role enthusiastically, yet his exalted public addresses which hailed the Basques and their love of liberty did not advance political demands and were flavored with conservative, Carlist zeal rather than with Basque nationalism.in 1918 Elorza declared: ‚Äúesta es una gran manifestaci√≥n de fevasca, el grito de una raza que mira hacia un ideal. Los corazones guipuzcoanos est√°n fundidos por el amor a la hidalga tierra √©uskara. El emblema de todos ha de ser ¬´Laurak Bat¬ª. Nuestro ideal de amor es un ideal de libertad‚Äù, quoted after Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 142 From 1919 onwards Elorza was vital for further growth of SEV; as its president and president of Gipuzkoan self-government at the same time he shielded the Sociedad politically, provided financial support, facilitated day-to-day activities and ensured prestige. SEV early publication, 1921 Elorza has always been an advocate of Basque-Navarrese unity and he hailed Laurak Bat as the symbol of all Basques;Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 142 prior to the 2. SEV Congress in Pamplona in 1920 he went to great lengths to ensure that the Navarrese and Pamplonese authorities, dominated by the Carlists and suspicious of Basque nationalism, support the project.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 155 During the 3. SEV Congress in Guernica in 1922 Elorza caused a sensation when he approached Alfonso XIII, present during the opening session, in Euskera; the lecture was rather welcome by the addressee, though because of its loyalist tone it raised many eyebrows among the Carlists.Elorza addressed Alfonso XIII as follows: ‚ÄúZuk esandako aegiteko, euskera alik eta geien erabili bear degu. Gaur nik agur au euskeraz egitea, zure agindua betetzea bezelaxe da, bada, Jauna‚Äù, quoted after Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 158 Since the early 1920s SEV started to award Premio Juli√°n Elorza, set up for the best work on history of the Basque people.Euskal Erria 30.11.21, available here; the Elorza Prize is awarded until today In 1922 SEV started work on a would-be autonomy statute and Elorza entered a commission entrusted with the task.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 156 The move gave rise to controversies, as especially the Biscay self-government, dominated by the Alfonsist Liga Mon√°rquica de Vizcaya,Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 151 turned increasingly against Elorza; they suspected him of fomenting Basque separatism.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 156 The Vizcainos sabotaged Elorza's efforts to set up an all-Basque university and agonized about anticipated Jesuit influences;Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 168 they denounced Elorza as ‚Äúel m√°s peligroso de los vascongados actuales‚Äù.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, pp. 168-169 Preparations for the 4. SEV Congress, planned for 1924 and to be dedicated exclusively to the autonomy question, were moving on grudgingly.‚Äúe recogido en Bilbao impresiones muy pesimistas de la pol√≠tica vizca√≠na...; coinciden todos en la necesidad de levantar una bandera que mate las intransigencias y exageraciones de unos y otros, sobre todo las de la Liga, que, afortunadamente, parece que tiene ya enemigos muy poderosos; sobre todo se lamentaban de la ausencia total de energ√≠as y de vitalidad en el pueblo, indiferente en absoluto a todas las tropel√≠as del Poder Central. La Liga [LigaMon√°rquica de Vizcaya], en suodio al nacionalismo, ha despertado la aversi√≥n a todo lo nuestro‚Äù, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 156 In late 1923 SEV issued a possibly vague and non-committal statement which acknowledged the Primo coupEstorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 180 and decided that in new political circumstances the 4. Congress should be postponed.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 167 Gipuzkoan president Ferrocarril del Urola Elorza's tenure as head of the provincial self-government was not marked by overtly political stand. Though sporadically he was taking part in Traditionalist rallies like the one in ZumarragaHeraldo Alaves 23.01.18, available here and though in wake of the 1920 Mellista breakup he signed a letter of adhesion to the claimant Don Jaime,in February 1920 Elorza co-signed a letter of adhesion to Don Jaime, confirming loyalty in wake of the Mellista breakup; other signatories were Conde Rodezno, Beunza, Marqu√©s de Vessola, Marqu√©s de Hormazas, Pascual Com√≠n and Marcelino Ulibarri, La Reconquista 07.02.20, available here none of the sources consulted claims he pursued a zealous Carlist agenda. As president of the Diputaci√≥n he was involved in usual administrative tasks like maintenance and development of transport facilities;see e.g. Larrinaga 2013, p. 244 his most lasting achievement was completion of Ferrocarril del Urola, the railway line launched in 1920 and operated until the 1980s.the Gipuzkoan diputaci√≥n took over the project following a histor of failed private attempts, Larrinaga 2013, pp. 244-250; see also Juan Peris Torner, Ferrocarril de Urola, [in:] Ferrocarriles de Espa√±a service 06.05.12, available here The thread which during the late 1910s and early 1920s was increasingly gaining prominence was his activity in Sociedad de Estudios Vascos; as Gipuzkoan president he supported the organization ‚Äì which he also presided ‚Äì financially and politically. This stand led to growing conflict with the Biscay self- government, anxious about perceived Elorza's pro-nationalist turn.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 156 The Vizcainos started to withdraw from common projects; in the early 1920s Elorza came under fire also for financial misfortunes suffered by joint inter-provincial enterprises, especially for the failure of Banco Vasco.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 195 Shortly after the coup of Primo de Rivera Elorza met with presidents of Biscay, Alavese and Navarrese diputaciones; he pushed through a project to seize the moment and present the case for autonomy to the dictator.Larrinaga 2013, p. 211 In late 1923 the presidents finalized Proyecto de Memoria al Directorio Militar, a memorandum prepared mostly by the Gipuzkoan diputaci√≥nLarrinaga 2013, pp. 214-215 and partially attributed personally to Elorza,the key person credited is Ignacio P√©rez Arregui; Elorza and C√©sar Balmaseda are listed as other major contributors, Larrinaga 2013, p. 211, Arbeloa 2015, p. 27 who by some is named ‚Äúprincipal impulsor del intento auton√≥mico‚Äù.Santiago de Pablo, Ludger Mees, Jos√© Antonio Rodr√≠guez Ranz, El p√©ndulo patri√≥tico: historia del Partido Nacionalista Vasco, vol. 1, Madrid 2001, p. 164 The project largely followed the path set by the 1917 Vitoria document, opting for ‚Äúreintegraci√≥n foral‚Äù or, as option B, for regional-provincial autonomy.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 172 Marked by conservative ‚Äúantijacobinismo‚Äù,Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, pp. 170-171 the proposal advocated among others creation of a Consejo Regional, elevating Basque to official language (along Spanish), introduction of autonomous regulations related to justice, military service, economy and education, and wide municipal autonomy. Elorza later met with Primo personally to present the case.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 213 Primo de Rivera and members of the Gipuzkoan diputaci√≥n Scholars claim that while Elorza tried to exercise some pressure on PrimoEstorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 168 and opposed few of his moves, like appointment of ‚Äúdelegados gubernativos‚Äù for every province,Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 168 he should not be viewed as the dictator's political enemy; he rather tried to bank on apparent primoderiverista re-definition of the system.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 180 Still, he failed to convince the dictator and apparently also Alfonso XIII, even though he was admitted in the court in early 1924.La Voz de Asturias 16.04.24, available here However unlike in case of other provinces Primo spared the vasco-navarrese diputaci√≥nes from dissolution, in late 1924exact date is not clear; in early September 1924 Elorza was still listed as president, Larrinaga 2013, p. 229; another author claims he was deposed ‚Äúone month after‚Äù the September 1924 debate on a homage album, planned to be published by the Gipuzkoan diputaci√≥n (the plan was eventually dropped in order not to antagonize the Biscay diputaci√≥n), Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 182 the military administration deposed Elorza from the Gipuzkoan presidencyEstorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 182 and replaced with Vicente Laffite Obineta, an Alfonsist monarchist from the Maurista faction;compare Lafitte Obine, Vicente entry, [in:] Au√±amendi Eusko Entziklopedia service, available here Elorza was reduced to vice-president, the function performed through all of 1925.Guia Oficial de Espa√±a 1925, available here In 1926 many members of the Gipuzkoan Diputaci√≥n, the body already deprived of most of its competencies, were dismissed and replaced by military appointees; Elorza was among these sacked.Larrinaga 2013, p. 206 SEV president, mid-years Elorza as SEV president speaking (on balcony) In the mid-1920s SEV was increasingly torn by differences between the Gipuzkoan and the Biscay disputations; while Elorza approached the dictator with proposals related to bilingualism, Basque university and municipal autonomy, his chief Biscay opponent Lequerica kept denouncing him as representative of ‚Äúuna tendencia contra el sentimiento espa√±olista del Pa√≠s [Vascongado]‚Äù. Eventually in 1924 the Biscay board withdrew its representatives from SEV and curtailed links to the organization, with the immediate result of ending financial subsidies.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 176 Elorza considered legal action against the Biscay Diputaci√≥n, but his proposal did not pass at the SEV executive.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 182 Some criticism came also from the ecclesiastic hierarchy, as the Church remained cautious about perceived lack of explicit confessional threads in SEV.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, pp. 182-186 On the other hand, the Carlist claimant Don Jaime fully supported Elorza's efforts to get the foral laws restored;Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 180 also within Sociedad he received homages as the one who ‚Äúdirige a la uni√≥n y bien de supais le hace merecedor de la estimaci√≥n de todos los vascos, sin distinci√≥n de opiniones ni intereses‚Äù.Heraldo Alaves 14.02.24, available here As the dictatorial environment made autonomy plans irrelevant and as Gipuzkoan-Biscay conflict increasingly paralyzed Sociedad, after 1924 SEV entered a period of what is referred to as ‚Äúsemi-hibernation‚Äù.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 194 In 1926, following his dismissal from the Gipuzkoan Diputaci√≥n, Elorza ceased to represent the province in the SEV's executive, replaced by Jos√© Luis Gaytan de Ayala.Estornes Zubizarreta 1983, pp. 45-46 He retained the post of Sociedad's president though increasingly tired and frustrated, Elorza a few times tried to resign;Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 195 none of his resignation letters was accepted.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1983, p. 38 Relations with the Vizcainos improved once a new Biscay Diputaci√≥n was appointed in 1926;Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 178 the same year in Vitoria Elorza presided over 4. SEV Congress,Heraldo Alaves 02.08.26, available here dedicated not as initially planned to autonomy, but to ‚Äúorientaci√≥n y ense√±anza profesionales‚Äù.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 196 This time Alfonso XIII did not attend; the gathering offered Primo their full co-operation.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 196 In 1927 Elorza published his best known and in fact only major work,\\"Elorza no es un intelectual en el sentido estricto del t√©rmino\\", Pedro Jos√© Chac√≥n Delgado, Nobleza con libertad. Biograf√≠a de la derecha vasca, Bilbao 2015, , p. 590 a prologue to Zaballa's study on Concierto Econ√≥mico;see Juli√°n Elorza, Prologo, [in:] Federico de Zaballa Allende, El Concierto Econ√≥mico. Qu√© ha sido, qu√© es y qu√© debe ser, Bilbao 1927 critical about new Calvo's municipal legislation, Elorza retained conciliatory tone versus the Primo regime.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, pp. 189-190 However, SEV's exhibition on civil wars, planned to be staged in Pamplona, was cancelled by administration, anxious about crypto- Carlist propaganda.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, pp. 199-200. In 1927 Elorza was asked by Campi√≥n to give lectures at the 1928 Cursos de Verano, organized by SEV in San Sebasti√°n; it is not clear whether he accepted the invitation, Jos√© Javier Granja Pascual, Arturo Campi√≥n y la historia, [in:] Pr√≠ncipe de Viana 10 (1988), p. 173 SEV Congress, Bergara 1930 (Elorza 1st from left) The fall of Primo changed Elorza's fortunes. In 1930 the new Dictablanda regime agreed to include Elorza in the Gipuzkoan Diputaci√≥n.the process was a hybrid one. A new diputaci√≥n, appointed in February 1930, asked that the body be enlarged and come out with own suggestions, followed in the subsequent decision of the civil governor, authorised by the Madrid government in April 1930, Larrinaga 2013, pp. 209-210. The body was presided by Ricardo A√±√≠barro, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 206 The same year he headed preparations to the 5. SEV Congress in Bergara;Heraldo Alaves 01.09.30, available here as usual he assumed a withdrawn stand and in wake of fears about politicization of the gathering he left it to the commissions to work out details.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 212 He then presided over the Congress works, which renewed the autonomy questionEstorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 262 and appointed Elorza to a 5-member commission entrusted with drafting a detailed proposal;Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, pp. 210, 274-5 he formed part also of a sub-comisi√≥n on Gipuzkoa.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 280 It seems that at the time Elorza still viewed autonomy largely as return to 19th-century fueros, perhaps enhanced with some sort of federative vasco-navarrese regulations.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 260 Separatist threads were marginalized; the Congress closed with Gernikako Arbola followed by Marcha Real,Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 250 though some scholars claim it tended to accidentalism.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 254 SEV president, late years Autonomy Statute declared, Estella 1931 In April 1931 the Republican authorities terminated Elorza's spell in the Gipuzkoan Diputaci√≥n and dissolved the entire body.Arbeloa 2015, p. 89 His exact views on renewed perspectives for Basque autonomy are not clear; he was impressed by proclamation of the Catalan Republic,Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 311 but as representative of Gipuzkoa he co-signed a Carlist manifesto which focused on provincial fueros.in April 1931 Elorza co-signed a Carlist declaration which demanded restoration of foral rights and institutions and pointed to common Basque territory, but which also rejected any supra-provincial organisation; among the signatories together with Paguaga and Hormazas he represented Gipuzkoa, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 339 Asked by vasco-navarrese mayors, SEV stepped up its works on Basque autonomy;Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 391 its draft proposalit seems that there was little work progressed on Basque autonomy in 1930; the draft was elaborated in early 1931 mostly by Ram√≥n Madariaga, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 394 envisioned 4 semi-autonomous provinces united in a Basque-Navarrese federation.Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939, Cambridge 2008, , p. 81 Elorza was skeptical about proposed separate Basque citizenshipElorza preferred a very loose definition of Basque citizenship, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, pp. 391, 394 and especially about handing over religious issues to Madrid;Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 413 his objections might have gridlocked the proceedings.during final SEV session Elorza and other Carlists suggested that SEV adopts 2 versions of the draft, the final one to be decided by the people; the proposal was defeated, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 413, Arbeloa 2015, p. 143 To avoid stalemate Elorza left the decisive SEV sitting,most scholars claim that Elorza faked an urgent call to Azpeitia, see e.g. Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 413; however, some authors believe that he indeed had to leave, Arbeloa 2015, p. 143 opening the way for the draft to be adopted as the official ‚ÄúSEV Statute‚Äù.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 413 In June 1931 the ‚ÄúSEV Statute‚Äù was subject to approval at a grand meeting of vasco-navarrese mayors in Estella.originally the meeting of vasco-navarrese mayors was planned to be held in Pamplona. However, the Carlists executive planned their own party rally at the same day. Elorza worked hard to get the Carlist rally cancelled, but failed and decided to move to mayors‚Äô rally to Estella. Faced with a dilemma whether to attend the Pamplona or the Estella rally he opted for the latter, Chac√≥n Delgado 2015, p. 591 The gathering was co-presided by Elorza and it introduced changes to the \\"SEV Statute\\", mostly in line with his earlier objections;the amendments adopted were bringing religious issues under the competence of autonomous, Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 49-50 in a frenetic closing session Elorza raised the \\"¬°Gora Euzkadi!\\" cry.‚ÄúPor nuestro lema inmortal: Dios y Fueros, Jaungoikoa eta Lege Zarrak... ¬°Viva Navarra! ¬°Gora Euzkadi!‚Äù, quoted after Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 462. Elorza frequently referred also to vasco-navarrese unity; during the Estella rally said ‚Äúpor el Estatuto que hab√©is aprobado hace unas horas pide Euzkadi el reconocimiento de supersonalidad para regirse por s√≠ misma y la desaparci√≥n de las trabas y de las dificuldades que imped√≠an la realizaci√≥n de sus destinos. Ni por el origen, nipor la lengua, nipor las tradiciones nu puede haber fronteras entre nosotros. Conviene pue que el Laurak Bat sea an lo sucesivo el m√°s firme sillad de nuestra posici√≥n‚Äù quoted after Chac√≥n Delgado 2015, p. 591 Some SEV members claimed that he inspired and manipulated the amendments;Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 462. Some scholars claim that the amendments were inspired by the Carlists, uneasy about anti-religious violence rocking Spain in May 1931; the theory quotes Indalecio Prieto‚Äôs theory that the reactionists intended to build a ‚ÄúVaticanist Gibraltar‚Äù in the vasco-navarrese territory, see e.g. Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 41-67. Another author from the same schools notes that the amendements were earlier proposed by local Gipuzkoan councils during their pre-meeting in Azpeitia, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, pp. 448-451. According to a competitive theory, the initiative of amending the SEV statute originated in Basque nationalist circles and was only later adopted by the Carlists, Jaime Igancio del Burgo, La Epopeya de la Foralidad Vasca y Navarra. Principio y fin de la cuesti√≥n foral (1812-1982), s.l. 2015, , p. 266 others noted that Elorza and other Carlists like Urquijo hijacked the project. He later excused himself, claiming that in Estella he was speaking not as a SEV president but on his own behalf.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 465 The ‚ÄúEstella Statute‚Äù became soon irrelevant anyway; when presented to the newly elected Cortesin late May early June 1931 Elorza was briefly considered as a joint Carlist-Basque candidate to the Cortes, as his concilliatory attitude made him acceptable to PNV and the Integrists. It is not clear whether Elorza refused or his candidature was dropped; eventually this role was successfully assumed by Julio Urquijo, Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 497 it was declared non- constitutional.the Constitution has not been agreed at the time, yet works on it were already advanced A new 1932 autonomy draft was presented by Comisiones Gestoras, acting in place of the dissolved diputaciones; known as ‚ÄúGestoras Statute‚Äù it advanced a unitary vasco-navarrese autonomy.‚Äúsingle, regional Statute rather than the alternative of four linked provincial Statutes‚Äù, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 81 Elorza decided to support the statute, even though it was less to his liking than the original ‚ÄúSEV Statute‚Äù.the Carlist executive failed to square the circle and did not work out a common stand on Basque autonomy, they called every Carlist to approach the issue according to his own conscience, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 82 However, the Navarrese mayors rejected the draft;Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 82-83 the statute had to be re-worked for the 3 Basque provinces only. The Gestoras invited all parties to form a joint committee working out the draft. Elorza co-authoredtogether with P√©rez Arregui a memorandum, aimed for the Carlist executive; it marked his turn towards more intransigent position. He declared the entire process unfair and since executed along republican lines, doomed for failure;Elorza and P√©rez were highly critical of the process because 1) autonomy marginalized the traditional path of ‚Äúrestauraci√≥n foral‚Äù; 2) it helped to republicanize Vascongadas; 3) neither Republic nor Alfonsine monarchy could have re- implemented proper order, and the Traditionalist Monarchy was able to achieve it, Santiago de Pablo, El carlismo guipuzcoano y el Estatuto Vasco, [in:] Bilduma 2 (1988), p. 200 the document called for Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista not to appoint its representatives,Elorza and P√©rez considered 3 options: 1) frontal opposition; 2) appointment of delegates; 3) refusal to join on the ground of unjust party representation and sending memorandum how statute should look like. They eventually settled for the last one, De Pablo 1988, pp. 199-202 to demand ‚Äúreintegraci√≥n foral‚Äù as the only proper acknowledgement of Basque aspirations,unlike Blinkhorn or Estornes some scholars claim that the principal reason for Carlist doubts about the statute were not religious issues, but presumed incompatibility between autonomy and foralism, De Pablo 1988, p. 206. Another key issue was the Republican origin of the autonomy. However, Elorza and P√©rez preferred not to challenge the autonomous project as they were anxious that otherwise the Carlists would have been blamed for its failure, De Pablo 1988, pp. 206-207 but also to prohibit any Carlist anti- statute propaganda.the key lines of Carlist position as proposed by Elorza and P√©rez were ‚Äúreintegracion foral‚Äù, bilingualism, educational self-government, internal autonomy of each province and the option for Navarre to join later, De Pablo 1988, p. 206 The renewed ‚ÄúGestoras Statute‚Äù was prepared with no Carlist participation; in 1933 it was approved in a referendum in Gipuzkoa and Biscay, but rejected in Alava; the project was stalled again.in Alava 46% of voters supported the project with a 2/3 majority needed to make it pass, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 106. A legal debate ensued, it subject being whether the Alavese defeat wrecked the entire project or not, given in Biscay, Gipuzkoa and Alava total the 2/3 majority was achieved. The new right-wing Cortes shelved the project, which resumed in the spring of 1936 by the new, Frente Popular dominated parliament, see Del Burgo 2015, pp. 304-314 sitting of SEV executive, 1935 (Elorza 1st row in the middle) In 1934 Elorza presided over the 6.

He declined and declared that ‚Äúno es este mi momento‚Äù.Chac√≥n Delgado 2015, p. 592 His only wartime public activity was noted in mid-1937, when a few Azpeitian girls were brought to court charged with fomenting Basque nationalism and with earlier engagement in anti-Carlist repression. Elorza testified speaking in favor of the accused, who eventually were either released or received minor fines.Chac√≥n Delgado 2015, pp. 37-38 He then withdrew into privacy, even though as late as in 1939 he was mentioned on societ√© columns of local press.Pensamiento Alaves 30.01.39, available here He is not known to have undertook any efforts to resume SEV activities in the Francoist Spain or to have remained in touch with Basque √©migr√©s who tried to re-activate SEV on exile in France,in most sources Elorza is listed as the SEV president until 1936, compare e.g. Presidentes de Eusko Ikaskuntza entry, [in:] Eusko Ikaskuntza service, available here though in the early 1940s he exchanged correspondence with the then exiled former Secretary General of SEV, Angel de Apraiz y Buesa.see correspondence between Elorza and Apraiz, exchanged in 1941-1942 and stored in Eusko Ikaskuntza archives, e.g. here Elorza was reportedly profoundly depressed by Francoist legislation, which stripped Gipuzkoa of any remnants of separate establishments.‚Äúit is pain for me to walk below these arches and to see no miqueletes‚Äù, wrote Elorza in 1939 when referring to the Gipuzkoan diputaci√≥n building, Chac√≥n Delgado 2015, p. 592 Don Javier, 1960 There is almost no information available on the last 20 years of Elorza's life; none of the sources consulted notes him as engaged in either public activities or semi-clandestine Carlist structures.Elorza is not mentioned a single time in lengthy PhD disserations dealing with Carlism during the Francoist era, see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, El naufragio de las ortodoxias.

Cuadernos de Historia-Geograf√≠a 38 (2012), p. 1131 The move was intended to attract the Basques, increasingly leaning towards nationalism; with his pro-autonomy record Elorza was supposed to enhance Carlist pro-Basque credentials. As Elorza's health has already massively deteriorated and he was hardly leaving home the nomination would have been largely fictitious, but the project was abandoned anyway.V√°zquez de Prada 2012, p. 1135 Reception and legacy Elorza represents an identity spanning Carlism and peripheral nationalism. It was by no means unusual and since the late 19th century many such cases emerged on the borderlands in-between Traditionalism and emerging Basque, Galician, Cantabrian or Catalan national movements.other comparable cases were those of a Cantabrian Jos√© Mar√≠a de Pereda, a Gallego Alfredo Bra√±as and a Basque Daniel Irujo, Jordi Canal i Morell, Banderas blancas, boinas rojas: una historia pol√≠tica del carlismo, 1876-1939, Madrid 2006, , pp. 214-9, Jordi Canal, Carlisme i catalanisme a la fi del segle XIX. Notes sobre unes relacions complexes, [in:] Le discours sur la nation en Catalogne aux XIXe et XXe si√®cles. Hommage √† Antoni M. Badia i Margarit, Paris 1995, pp. 211‚Äì230 Some personalities following a period of indecision and hope that the two concepts can be aligned have eventually decided to break with Carlism; within the Basque ambience this is e.g. the case of Daniel Irujo.Angel Garcia- Sanz Marcotegui, Daniel Irujo Urra: 1862-1911: el carlo-nacionalismo imposible del defensor de Sabino Arana. Ensayo y testimonio, Tafalla 1995, Juli√°n Elorza has never moved to this stage and has always nurtured faith in viability of ‚Äúcarlo-nacionalismo‚Äù. Elorza's Carlist credentials are not in doubt; coming from the Carlist family he declared his loyalty to the claimant in 1920La Reconquista 07.02.20, available here and featured in plans of another claimant in 1961.V√°zquez de Prada 2012, p. 1135 However, within Carlism he has always been a back-row figure. He has never held important posts in the party structure and barely held any posts in the organization at all,the only exception identified was the position of ‚Äúvocal adjunto‚Äù in the provincial Gipuzkoan party command in 1033, Pensamiento Alaves 06.10.33, available here he has never represented the movement in popular elections, he has never contributed to Carlist press and he has been rarely taking part in Traditionalist rallies. While Carlists were typically associated with intransigency and pugnacity if not indeed fanaticism, Elorza has usually demonstrated a penchant for compromise.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 122 The Basque case that Elorza advanced was shaped along Traditionalist lines. In terms of legal arrangements he stuck to the concept of re-implementation of old province-specific separate arrangements perhaps integrated in a vague, vasco-navarrese framework. In terms of cultural model he opted for traditional Basque heritage, entrenched in rural, religious, conservative ethnicity. However, when faced with modern Basque nationalism Elorza was prepared to bend his line; though with little enthusiasm he supported the concept of unitary vasco-navarrese and then even Basque regional autonomy and he was increasingly moving from an ethnicity-based cultural Basque identity to a nationality-based political one. Few of his fellow Carlists ‚Äì like Julio Urquijo or Joaqu√≠n Beunza ‚Äì were ready to go that far. However, Elorza was prepared to move where no other Carlist agreed to go; he accepted the ikurri√±aduring the gathering of vasco-navarrese mayors in Estella in 1931, presided by Elorza, the table was covered in 2 ikurri√±a standards, see here. When asked by ayuntamiento of Durango about the usage of ikurri√±a, in September 1931 the SEV responded with a note, signed by Elorza:. This opinion put an end to the period of precarious usage of ikurri√±a and consecrated it as a standard of all Basques: ‚Äûno existe un emblema o bandera que haya representado a todo el Pa√≠s Vasco en su pasada historia, del mismo modo que las banderas de todos los pa√≠ses son tambi√©n relativemente modernas; pero el uso ya generalizado de la actual bandera conocida como vasca, que ha ondeado recientemente en los edificios de muchas corporaciones oficiales de nuestro Pa√≠s Vasco [...], permite asegurar que dicha exposici√≥n no puede suponer idea alguna partidista sino una expresi√≥n de la unidad espiritual de los vascos, que debe estar por encima de todas las suspicacias‚Äù, I√±aki Ega√±a, Diccionario hist√≥rico-pol√≠tico de Euskal Herria, Tafalla 1996, , p. 417 and during the Civil War he probably publicly spoke in favor of Aguirre.El Cant√°brico 10.02.37, available here His withdrawal into privacy after 1939 is flavored with the sense of utter defeat; not only carlo- nacionalismo proved impossible, but both Carlist and Basque ideas were suppressed by the emerging Francoism.this is how some authors read Elorza‚Äôs declaration that ‚Äúno es este mi momento‚Äù, Chac√≥n Delgado 2015, p. 592 Elorza has not earned a scientific historiographic monograph yet, be it an article or a major work, and his name appears mostly in studies dedicated either to Sociedad de Estudios VascosElorza is mentioned more than 100 times in Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990 or to the Gipuzkoan diputaci√≥n.Elorza is mentioned some 10 times in Larrinaga 2013 His memory is cherished neither by the Basque nationalistssee e.g. the PNV site, available here nor by the Carlists,see e.g. the site of Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista, available here though as longtime president of SEV he is present in the Eusko Ikaskuntza related websites.Elorza Aizpuru, Juli√°n entry, [in:] Au√±amendi Eusko Entziklopedia service online, available here When noted in public discourse, he is introduced as a high Gipuzkoan public official and an efficient administrator.Alberdi Ega√±a 2014 His death was acknowledged in a dedicated session of the Azpeitian ayuntamientoAlberdi Ega√±a 2014 and a major street in Azpeitia is still named after him.see e.g. Avenida Juli√°n Elorza, [in:] Callejero service, available here See also * Carlism * Traditionalism (Spain) * Estatuto de Autonom√≠a del Pa√≠s Vasco de 1936 * Diputaci√≥n Foral de Guip√∫zcoa * Sociedad de Estudios Vascos Notes Further reading * Jaime Ignacio del Burgo, La Epopeya de la Foralidad Vasca y Navarra.

Biography   During the Resistance  In 1943, Boldrini joined the then clandestine Italian Communist Party and has been one of the main promoters of the Italian resistance movement in Romagna. During the Resistance, Boldrini was the National Liberation Committee's reference man of Ravenna and leader of the 28th Garibaldi Brigade entitled to the partisan \\"Mario Gordini\\". During the Nazi-Fascist occupation, Boldrini was always at the forefront during the liberation missions in Romagna and was nicknamed Bulow, an homage to Prussian general Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B√ºlow. After the end of the war, his Brigade was accused of the massacre in 1945 of some surrendered RSI soldiers in Codevigo: he was accused by several right- wing researchers to be the principal mandator and there is a sentence that proves the massacre.  After the War  Boldrini has embodied the ethical and political motives behind the struggle of the Italian Resistance, becoming one of the most authoritative and credible representatives at the institutional level: after being elected to the Constituent Assembly, Boldrini became the first President of the National Association of Italian Partisans, holding this office from 1947 to 2006. Boldrini has been later elected to the Chamber of Deputies from 1948 to 1972 and to the Senate from 1972 to 1992, being a member of the Parliament uninterruptedly from 1948 to 1994. In 1991, Boldrini joined the Democratic Party of the Left, and in 1998 he joined the Democrats of the Left until he decided to leave politics in 2005.

The Chinese pirates and northern Vietnamese girls had sex but the Vietnamese women then wet the gun barrels of the Chinese pirates ships with their handkerchiefs which they got wet. They then left in the same boats. The Vietnamese navy then attacked the Chinese pirate fleet which was unable to fire back with their wet guns. The Chinese pirate fleet, originally 206 junks, was reduced to 50-80 junks by the time it reached south Vietnam's Quang Nam and the Mekong delta. The Chinese pirates having sex with north Vietnamese women may also have transmitted a deadly epidemic from China to the Vietnamese which ravaged the Tonkin regime of north Vietnam.

His bloody accession led to the secession of the Al Bu Falasah and the establishment of the Maktoum dynasty in Dubai.  Accession  In April 1833, Khalifa took power alongside his brother and co-conspirator Sultan, deposing his other brother Tahnun and killing him in the process. Khalifa was the pre-eminent of the two and Sultan quickly took a subordinate position. Khalifa moved to declare Abu Dhabi in allegiance to the Wahhabi Amir. His rule was almost immediately threatened by a plot to remove him and install a cousin in his place, but he acted decisively and executed three of the ringleaders. A public outcry and the intervention of Sultan stopped him from delivering the same sentence to two prominent merchants and he settled for having one beaten, his property confiscated and exiled to Lingeh.  Secession  This action of Khalifa's led to the secession of most the Al Bu Falasah section of the Bani Yas during the pearling season of that year, establishing themselves in the town of Dubai to the North of Abu Dhabi. Dubai at the time was a dependency of Abu Dhabi under headman Sheikh Mohammed bin Hazza bin Zaal. Led by Maktoum bin Butti bin Suhail and Obeid bin Said bin Rashid, the migration of some 800 members of the Al Bu Falasah took over the town, with the complicity of Mohammed bin Zaal, at the time consisting of some 250 houses at Shindagha and the Al Fahidi Fort on the other side of the Ghubaiba inlet. The migration would have been an arduous undertaking, and took place over some time throughout and following the pearling season of that year (typically May to November). Almost immediately afterwards, Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah led a force to Abu Dhabi, blockading the town. This was followed by the secession of the Qubaisat section of the Bani Yas, who left and settled in Khawr al Udayd. They took up a career in piracy until, in May 1837, Khalifa‚Äîwith British acquiescence‚Äîattacked the settlement and sacked it, filling the wells, destroying the buildings and killing at least 50. While some of the tribe fled to Dubai, Khalifa's treatment of those who returned to Abu Dhabi was indulgent and eventually the secessionists, including their headman, returned under a general amnesty.  Death  In an egregious breach of the Bedouin laws of hospitality, Khalifa bin Shakhbut was murdered by his hosts in July 1845, when he accepted an invitation to a feast on the beach at Abu Dhabi. With most of the inhabitants of the town away pearling or tending the date plantations, a man by the name of Isa bin Khalid, who had long had designs on Khalifa's life, killed him at the conclusion of the feast. His death led to a short and bloody fight for the succession, with a number of claimants vying murderously for the position of Ruler. This was brought to an end by two influential leaders of the Bani Yas, Mohammed bin Humaid and Rashid bin Fadhil, who nominated a son of the former leader Tahnun bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan, Saeed bin Tahnun.

As a result of the construction of an elevated roadway along William Henry Street, the pumping station now fronts Pyrmont Street, with vehicles being required to enter via Quarry Street, then turning right into Pyrmont Street. The pumping station was designed and built by the New South Wales Department of Public Works from 1899 to 1902. It is also known as Sewage Pumping Station 1, SPS 1, SPS 0001 and The Controlling Station. The property is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  In 1859 Sydney's sewerage system consisted of five outfall sewers which drained to Sydney Harbour. By the 1870s, the Harbour had become grossly polluted (especially with the nearby abattoir at Glebe Island) and there were outbreaks of Enteric Fever (typhoid) throughout the period 1870s - 1890s. As a result, the NSW Government created the Sydney City and Suburban Health Board to investigate an alternative means of disposing of the City's sewage. This led to the construction of two gravitation sewers in 1889 by the Public Works Department: a northern sewer being the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer and a southern sewer draining to a sewage farm at Botany Bay. Low-lying areas around the Harbour which could not gravitate to the new outfall sewers continued to drain to the old City Council Harbour sewers. Low level pumping stations were therefore needed to collect the sewage from such areas and pump it by means of additional sewers known as rising mains, to the main gravitation system. The first comprehensive low level sewerage system began at the end of the 19th century when the Public Works Department built a network of twenty low level pumping stations around the foreshores of the inner harbour and handed them over to the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage in 1904. SP0001 was the first and largest of these twenty stations and originally took the sewage from the City area in the Haymarket and on the south-western side of Darling Harbour. It was also the controlling station from which 17 of the other stations were manually controlled, although this function ceased about 1918. At least two of the early stations received their DC power from the Rushcutters Bay Tramway Powerhouse, near SP0018. Although called SPS No 1, the first SPS was the 1894 emergency Shone Ejector at St Peters (coal fired electricity) followed by the Double Bay Compressed Air Ejector Station (electricity from Rushcutters Bay) and the coal fired steam driven Marrickville Pumping Station (later SPS 271). Overall, greater Sydney now has over 600 low level sewage pumping stations.  Description  The pumping station consists of two parts: a superstructure comprising a rectangular two-storey loadbearing brick building; and a substructure constructed of concrete which houses machinery and sewage chambers. Architecturally, the building was designed in a restrained version of the Federation Free Style, exploiting the contrasts of surface and colour inherent in good brickwork and sandstone. Classical elements are evident in the symmetrical facade, the round-arched door openings and the echoes of balustrading in the parapets. Externally there are two principal elevations. The front of the building addresses William Henry Street and is a symmetrical composition of face brick with sandstone dressings in three bays, the centre one treated as a breakfront accommodating as entrance porch. There are projecting sandstone string courses at first floor level, window sill level and transom level. The parapet has a row of vertical recessed panels on each side of a raised and panelled centre section, giving the breakfront the character of a triumphal arch. The entry bay has a round arch with bullnosed intrados and moulded stone imposts at window transom level. The entrance consists of a pair of original four panel timber doors with fanlight. The Pyrmont Street facade is divided up into three bays, all treated differently to reflect functions within the building. The south bay continues the front facade treatment and is dominated by the entrance lobby which is expressed by a bold frontispiece of rock faced ashlar sandstone above a sandstone plinth. The frontispiece is penetrated by a Florentine-arched doorway having rock faced voussoirs and a smooth-tooled intrados. The centre bay expresses the former controlling room above and a store room below. The north bay is dominated by a ground floor arch, which is of brick and matches the arch over the William Henry Street entrance. Internally, the ground floor comprises a lobby accessed from Pyrmont Street and containing stairs which provide access the offices above and machinery chamber below. The remainder of this floor consists of storage and loading bay. The first floor comprised three spaces. On the south there was an office, in the middle was a controlling room and to the north there were a lavatory and store room. To the north there is vacant land (formerly the A.M.L.&F.; Wool Warehouse); to the west is another vacant block of land (formerly another woolstore); and to the south is the modern William Henry Bridge (which is higher and greatly enlarged by comparison with the former overbridge that was there when SP001 was erected - in 1900 the footpath of William Henry Street was about level with the upper floor of the Station. Across the road is the Powerhouse Museum (formerly the Ultimo Tramway Power House). The exterior of the building is substantially intact. Much of the original plant and equipment has been replaced.  Modifications and dates  The pumping station is substantially intact. Two pair of wrought iron gates have been removed from the arched entrances. Its function as the controlling station for the other 17 stations ceased and the switchboards have been removed from the first floor office. The single storey garage wing attached to the south elevation is an intrusive addition. Most of the mechanical and electrical components were upgraded during the 1970s. Direct current was replaced by alternating current in , and it was supplied by the City Council of Sydney Electricity Department which was the forerunner of the Sydney County Council.  Heritage listing  As at 4 May 2005, SP001 is of historic, aesthetic and technical/research significance. Historically it was part of an original network of twenty sewage pumping stations constructed in Sydney at the end of the 19th century. The station was a key component of this network, being the largest and controlling station for the performance of the other first generation stations. The station is also historically significant for its associations with the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer (BOOS) which was Sydney's first ocean outfall. The construction of SP001 and the BOOS (ten years earlier) formed a part of the major advance in the protection of the public health of Sydney by ending the discharge of sewage into the Harbour. They were built as a direct response to the outbreaks of Enteric Fever (Typhoid) which plagued Sydney from the 1870s to 1890s and the recommendations of the Sydney City and Suburban Health Board (which was established by the Government in 1875 to report on the best means of sewage disposal) which proposed the establishment of outfall sewers. Aesthetically it is an excellent example of a substantial and prominent industrial building designed in the Federation Free Style which due to its scale, colour, texture and location has considerable streetscape value. In its surviving fabric SP0001 provides evidence of technical excellence in traditional construction techniques and craftsmanship, such as the stone dressings around the entrance openings. Technically, the underground areas of the station are significant, being an early example of the use of reinforced concrete usage within Australia. It has educational potential in revealing the development of sewage pumping engineering works and architectural taste in a period when utilitarian buildings were given as much careful attention as public buildings. It is also technically significant for its continual use as a low level sewage pumping station as originally designed and constructed, albeit with mechanical and electrical upgrading. Originally it was supplied with direct current from the nearby Tramway's Department Powerhouse. Sewage Pumping Station 1 was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. SP0001, Ultimo was built in 1900 and was the first of the original network of twenty low level sewage pumping stations constructed to serve Sydney. The pumping stations along with the construction of the Bondi and Southern Outfall Sewers, formed a part of the major advance in the protection of the public health of Sydney by ending the discharge of sewage into the Harbour. The construction of SP0001(along with the other first generation stations) evidences the growth of Central Sydney and expansion of municipal services during the early part of the 20th century. Built in 1900, it also served as a controlling station for the other 17 first generation stations in the area. It consequently remained as the administrative headquarters for inner city \\"Minor Electric Pumping Stations\\". The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The building is a fine and unusual industrial example of the Federation Free Style of architecture in New South Wales. It displays in its fabric a rare combination of superior utilitarian design, architectural qualities and craftsmanship. The scale, colour, texture and detail of the building makes an effective contribution to the streetscape of Ultimo. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Item is listed on the National Trust (NSW) register and is thus recognised by an identifiable group, and as such has importance to the broader community. The excellent design of the building by the Department of Public Works reflects the body of work emanating from the then Government Architect, Walter Liberty Vernon. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. SP0001 is structurally significant as it demonstrates in its underground construction the early and superior exploitation of concrete which contributes to the understanding of the development and use of this material in Australia. From 1904 to 1918 it fulfilled an ingenious role, which reflects the enterprise of the engineers of that time. It functioned as the Controlling Station which monitored the performance of 17 other pumping stations. The pumping station still fulfils its role, nearly a century after its introduction, as a low level sewage pumping station as originally designed and constructed albeit with some mechanical upgrading. The original pumps were of the \\"plunger\\" type. This technique was prone to wear and blockages and was eventually replaced by centrifugal pumping units powered by AC motors and each station individually controlled. The same power source, although for electric trams, was utilised for opening and closing of the Pyrmont Bridge. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. SP0001 is unique as part of the network of first generation low level sewage pumping stations built to serve the historically significant Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer. As the controlling station for the first generation of SPSs, SP0001 is unique in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The superstructure is a representative example (in construction) of a large-scale Federation Free Style industrial building. SP0001 is a representative example of a low level sewage pumping station on the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer.

In an early career disrupted by training problem he won his only race as a two-year- old in 2005 and both of his starts in the following year. He won the Earl of Sefton Stakes on his debut as a four-year-old and then ran second in four consecutive Group 1 races, namely the Lockinge Stakes, Prince of Wales's Stakes, Eclipse Stakes and International Stakes. He was retired from racing at the end of the year and exported to become a breeding stallion in India. Background Phoenix Tower was a dark bay horse bred in Kentucky by his owner, Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms. The colt was sent to Europe where he entered training with Henry Cecil at the Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was the best European-raced horse produced by his sire Chester House, who won the Arlington Million but died in 2003 after only three seasons at stud. Phoenix Tower's dam Bionic won her only race, a maiden race at Goodwood Racecourse in 1998. Her dam Bonash, who won the Prix de Malleret, also produced the John Porter Stakes winner Day Flight and was closely related to the Prix de Diane winner Nebraska Tornado. Racing career 2006: two- year-old season On his racecourse debut Phoenix Tower was ridden by Richard Hughes when he started at odds of 5/1 for a maiden race over seven furlongs on the polytrack surface at Wolverhampton Racecourse on 30 October 2006. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths from the favourite Calabash Cove despite veering to the left in the closing stages. 2007: three-year-old season Phoenix Tower began his second campaign in a handicap race over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 20 April in which he was assigned 123 pounds and started at odds of 9/2 in a fourteen-runner field. Ridden by Hughes he tracked the leaders before taking the lead a furlong out and drew away to win \\"easily\\" by four lengths. Hughes was again in the saddle when the colt started 8/13 favourite for a minor event over one at Windsor Racecourse on 7 May and recorded another easy win, coming home two and a half lengths clear of his three opponents. Phoenix Tower subsequently had injury problems and missed the rest of the season. 2008: four-year-old season After an absence of eleven months Phoenix Tower returned to the track and was moved up in class and distance to contest the Group 3 Earl of Sefton Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 17 April 2008. Ridden by Tom Queally he started the 8/1 third choice in the betting behind Pipedreamer (Cambridgeshire Handicap) and the Cecil's other entrant Multidimensional (Prix Guillaume d'Ornano). He tracked the front-running Kandidate and after briefly looking unlikely to get a clear run he produced a strong finish to gain the advantage in the final strides and win by a head and a neck from Traffic Guard and Pipedreamer. After the race Henry Cecil said \\"he has always been a good horse but he has had his problems. He stays further and I think a mile and a quarter will suit him\\". In his four remaining races Phoenix Tower was ridden by Ted Durcan. In the Lockinge Stakes over mile at Newbury on 17 May he finished second, three quarters of a length behind the winner Creachadoir and ahead of several major winners including Haradasun and Majestic Roi. In the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot in June he stayed on in the straight to finish runner-up to Duke of Marmalade with Pipedreamer, Ask and Sixties Icon finishing behind. In the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park on 5 July Phoenix Tower was made the 5/2 favourite against seven opponents headed by the Aidan O'Brien-trained Mount Nelson. After racing in fifth place he moved up to take the lead in the straight but although he stayed on \\"gamely\\" he was caught on the line by Mount Nelson and beaten a short head. Following the colt's narrow defeat Cecil commented \\"I thought we had it won, but Mount Nelson's head went down at the crucial moment - that's racing. I have no excuses, and our fellow has run a blinder\\". The 2018 edition of the International Stakes was transferred from York Racecourse, where the ground was deemed unraceable to Newmarket on 23 August. Starting at odds of 12/1 he stayed on strongly to finish three quarters of a length second to Duke of Marmalade with the Epsom Derby winner New Approach two and a half lengths back in third. Phoenix Tower was being prepared for a run in the Champion Stakes when he sustained a tendon injury which ended his racing career. In the 2008 World Thoroughbred Rankings Phoenix Tower was given a rating of 123, making him the nineteenth-best racehorse in the world. Stud career At the end of his racing career, Phoenix Tower was exported to India to become a breeding stallion at the Manjri Stud Farm near pune his son Rochester won the Indian derby in 2018 Pune. Pedigree *Phoenix Tower was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Mr Prospector, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

It is an evergreen, terrestrial orchid with an cone-shaped stem, light green, shiny leaves and a large number of purple flowers crowded along a green and purple flowering stem. Description Crepidium marsupichilum is a terrestrial, evergreen herb with an upright or leaning cone-shaped stem and wide. There are between four and six shiny, light green leaves with wavy edges, long and wide. A large number of purple, non-resupinate flowers are crowded along a green and purple flowering stem long. The flowers are about long and wide. The sepals are about long and wide, the dorsal sepal turned stiffly downwards and the lateral sepals spread apart from each other with their tips turned downwards. The petals are about long and wide with their tips turned down. The labellum is horseshoe-shaped, long and about wide with a blunt tip and smooth edges. Flowering occurs between January and April. Taxonomy and naming The pouched spur orchid was first formally described in 1976 by Walter Thomas Upton who gave it the name Malaxis marsupichilum from a specimen collected in the McIlwraith Range. The description was published in The Orchadian. In 1995 Dariusz Szlachetko changed the name to Crepidium marsupichilum. Distribution and habitat Crepidium marsupichilum is widespread and common in tropical north Queensland including in the Iron Range and McIlwraith Range and on Torres Strait Islands where it grows in leaf litter in shady rainforest.

In his work, the author provides precious information on the history and the life of Altamura, perhaps drawing from documents now lost. The work has also been copied by priest D. Vitangelo Frizzale. The clearest limit of his work is perhaps the absence of critical analysis of the sources, and the commingling of history and legendary facts, as Ottavio Serena later pointed out.storie- inedite  Life  There is very little or no information on his life.

It can also be used to determine if a bearing is the correct choice for use in a given application. It is a product of bearing diameter (D) and speed (N). D = diameter (in millimeters) of the bearing in question. For most types of bearings, there are actually two required measurements: the inner diameter and outer diameter. In such cases, D = (A+B)/2, where A = inner diameter and B = outer diameter. The sum of these two values is then divided by 2 to obtain the median diameter, sometimes also called pitch diameter. N = bearing speed. This is the maximum amount of revolutions per minute (RPM) that the bearing will move. The DN factor of a bearing is obtained by multiplying the median diameter (A + B/2) by RPM, and sometimes by a correction factor. This correction factor may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. No consensus exists among tribologists as to a constant correction factor across manufacturers.  Example formula For a single or double row cylindrical bearing, the following formula would be used to obtain the DN factor. It includes a correction factor of 2: DN factor = ((A+B)/2) x RPM x 2 Where: * A and B represent inner and outer diameters, respectively * A and B are divided by 2 to find the median diameter * RPM is the maximum speed of the bearing * 2 is the correction factor for this particular (hypothetical) manufacturer Usage Once the DN factor of a bearing has been obtained, it can be used to consult grease selection charts in order to determine the correct lubricant. Viscosity must be matched to the needs of the bearing in order to obtain maximum efficiency, and to avoid lubricant runout due to overheating, which is a consequence of metal-on-metal contact, as well as the failure of grease to extract heat from the bearing system. Viscosity is quantified according to the National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI) consistency number, which is regarded as the standard measure of grease thickness. Knowing the DN factor of a bearing is critical to preventing lubricant starvation, which is characterized by decreasing lubricant film thickness coupled with increased bearing speed. Starvation occurs when bearing speed (N) exceeds the ability of the lubricant to flow back into the bearing track. This phenomenon can be the cause of metal-on-metal contact, which causes rapid wear and necessitates early replacement. Jauhari shows that degree of starvation is a function of relative lubricant layer thickness for given operating conditions. He also states that \\"the rolling fatigue life of [a] bearing depends greatly upon the viscosity and film thickness between the rolling contact-surface [sic].\\"  References  Online calculators exist to determine DN factor and correct grease viscosity.

Accession  Said acceded following the murder of his uncle, Sheikh Khalifa bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan. The murder led to a period of fighting for the leadership of the Bani Yas, with Sheikh Khalid's murderer, Isa bin Khalid attempting to take power but being himself killed by Dhiyab bin Isa. Khalid bin Isa then took Dhiyab's life and fled to Sharjah, leaving two influential leaders of the Bani Yas, Mohammed bin Humaid and Rashid bin Fadhil, to remove a claimant to the fort of Abu Dhabi, one of Khalid's brothers, and nominate a son of the former leader Tahnun bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan, Saeed bin Tahnun. Saeed arrived to Abu Dhabi to a smooth accession, supported by his two influential sponsors as well as approved of by the British. He quickly moved to quell a disturbance among the formerly secessionist Qubaisat and brought them to Abu Dhabi, stripped their boats and compelled them to pay their debts, return to the rule of Abu Dhabi and additionally pay a fine.  Buraimi  Saeed also moved on Buraimi, capturing his two forts back from the Wahhabis with the help of both the Dhawahir and Awamir tribes. He then pulled together the Bani Qitab, Ghafalah, Awamir and Bani Yas in Khatam and placed the Manasir and Mazari Bani Yas in Dhafrah to block the relieving Wahhabi army under Sa'ad bin Mutlaq. By 1850, Saeed's great tribal association had cleared Burami Oasis of Wahhabi forces. He subsequently accepted a stipend from the Sultan of Muscat for the defence of Buraimi.  Uprising  In 1855, Saeed bin Tahnun was embroiled in a dispute involving the murder by a tribal elder of his own brother. The murder was considered not without justification but Saeed was deaf to the imprecations of the Bani Yas and resolved to have the killer put to death. A promise was made to the man of forgiveness, but when he was brought into Saeed's presence, Saeed drew out his own dagger and killed the man. The resulting violent uprising drove Saeed to take refuge first in his fort and then to exile on the island of Qish. Saeed was succeeded by Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan.

It was designed and built by the New South Wales Public Works Department from 1902 to 1904. It is also known as Sewage Pumping Station 18 and SPS 18. The property is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  Rushcutters' Bay Local William Thomas was granted at the head of the bay in 1818 by Governor Macquarie, after one of his children was injured by Macquarie's carriage. Much of this land was reclaimed in 1878 to form a park. Rushcutters' Bay gets its name from the rushes that were cut from nearby swamps to thatch the early houses of the Sydney settlement. In the 19th century this process was called rush cutting at the bay. These major reed swamps were located near where White City tennis courts are today. This area of land has had a number of uses. After being drained and cleared the swamp land was replaced with extensive Chinese market gardens. Then, in 1913 the gardens were removed and the land transformed into an open air amusement park. In 1908 Sydney Stadium had been built on the corner of New South Head Road and Nield Avenue for the World Heavyweight title bout between Tommy Burns and Jack Johnson. This became known as the fight of the century and was won by Johnson, the first African-American world champion. The Beatles performed at Sydney Stadium in 1964. The stadium was demolished in 1970 to make way for the Eastern Suburbs railway line. White City Tennis courts were built in 1922 as the venue for the NSW Championships, now known as the Sydney International. It hosted this competition until moving to Homebush Bay ahead of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Reg Bartley Oval is named after a Lord Mayor of Sydney, who served from 1943‚Äì44 and 1946-48.Crosson, 2013 Sydney's Sewerage System In 1859 Sydney's sewerage system consisted of five outfall sewers which drained to Sydney Harbour. By the 1870s, the Harbour had become grossly polluted (especially with the nearby abattoir at Glebe Island) and there outbreaks of Enteric fever (typhoid) throughout the period 1870s to 1890s. As a result, the NSW Government created the Sydney City and Suburban Health Board to investigate an alternative means of disposing of the City's sewage. This led to the construction of two gravitation sewers in 1889 by the Public Works Department: a northern sewer being the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer and a southern sewer draining to a sewerage farm at Botany Bay. Low-lying areas around the Harbour which could not gravitate to the new outfall sewers continued to drain to the old City Council Harbour sewers. Low level pumping stations were therefore needed to collect the sewage from such areas and pump it by means of additional sewers known as rising mains, to the main gravitation system. The first comprehensive low level sewerage system began at the end of the 19th century when the Public Works Department built a network of twenty low level pumping stations around the foreshores of the inner harbour and handed them over to the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage in 1904. Overall, greater Sydney now has over 600 low level sewage pumping stations. At least two of the early stations received their DC power from the Rushcutters Bay Tramway Powerhouse, near SP0018. Although called SPS No 1 the first SPS was the 1894 emergency Shone Ejector at St Peters (coal fired electricity) followed by the Double Bay Compressed Air Ejector Station (electricity from Rushcutters Bay) and the coal fired steam driven Marrickville Pumping Station (later SPS 271).  Description  SP0018, Rushcutters Bay is a low level sewage pumping station located adjacent to Rushcutters Bay Park. It consists of two distinct parts: a superstructure comprising a rectangular single storey loadbearing brick building; and a substructure constructed of concrete which houses machinery and sewage chambers. Architecturally, the building was designed in a utilitarian version of the Federation Queen Anne style. Externally there is a slate gambrel roof with terracotta hip and ridge cappings with timber louvre gable vents and exposed eaves; double casement timber windows with multi paned fanlights; timber framed, ledged and sheeted double doors; dark red-brown tuck pointed brickwork laid in English bond with splayed brick plinth and engaged brick piers capped with rubbed sandstone; and rocked faced sandstone sills and lintels. Internally, the ceiling is lined with tongue and grooved boarding and walls are rendered and lined out to simulate ashlar coursing.  Modifications and dates  Substantially intact. Most of the mechanical and electrical components were upgraded during the 1970s.  Heritage listing  As at 7 June 2005, SP0018 Rushcutters Bay is of historic, aesthetic and technical/research significance. Historically it was one of an original group of twenty low level sewage pumping stations constructed at the end of the 19th century to serve Sydney. The station along with the construction of the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer (ten years earlier) formed a part of the major advance in the protection of the public health of Sydney by ending the discharge of sewage into the Harbour. They were built as a direct response to the outbreaks of Enteric Fever (Typhoid) which plagued Sydney from the 1870s to 1890s and the recommendations of the Sydney City and Suburban Health Board (which was established by the NSW government in 1875 to report on the best means of sewage disposal) which proposed the establishment of outfall sewers. Aesthetically, it is an excellent example of a small scale industrial building designed in the Federation Queen Anne style. In its surviving fabric SP0018 reflects the importance of Federation Period public utilities, which is evident in the technical excellence of the overall design, traditional construction techniques and craftsmanship such as the stone dressings and tuckpointed brickwork. Due to its prominent location in Rushcutters Bay Park, the station makes a valuable contribution to the local cultural landscape. The pumping station still fulfils its role nearly a century after its introduction as a low level sewage pumping station as originally designed and constructed, albeit with mechanical upgrading. It has educational and interpretation potential to reveal information about sewage pumping engineering and in architectural taste in a period when utilitarian buildings were given as much careful attention as public buildings. The station is a prominent feature of Rushcutters Bay Park and makes a valuable contribution to the townscape and cultural landscape of Rushcutters Bay. Sewage Pumping Station 18 was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. SP0018, Rushcutters Bay was built in 1902 and was among the original group of 20 low level sewage pumping stations constructed to serve Sydney. The pumping stations along with the construction of the Bondi and Southern Outfall Sewers, formed a part of the major advance in the protection of the public health of Sydney buy ending the discharge of sewage into the Harbour. The construction of SP0018 evidences the growth of Sydney and expansion of municipal services during the early part of the 20th century. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. SP0018 is an excellent example of a robust and well proportioned small scale industrial Federation Queen Anne style building which displays in its fabric a combination of superior utilitarian design, construction and craftsmanship. The scale, colour, texture and detail of the building makes an effective contribution to cultural landscape of Rushcutters Bay. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Item is listed on the National Trust (NSW) register and is thus recognised by an identifiable group, and as such has importance to the broader community. The excellent design of the superstructure by the Department of Public Works reflects the body of work emanating from the then Government Architect, Walter Liberty Vernon. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. SP0018 has the potential to reveal information about early 20th century construction techniques and design of the concrete substructure. The pumping station still fulfills its role nearly a century after its introduction as a low level sewage pumping station as originally designed and constructed albeit with some mechanical upgrading. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. SP0018 is unique as part of the group of first generation low level sewage pumping stations built to serve the historically significant Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The superstructure is a representative example of a small scale Federation Queen Anne style public utility building. SP0018 is a representative example of a low level sewage pumping station on the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer.

The original HCA Red List, which took two years to compile, was first published by the Heritage Crafts Association in on 3 May 2017 with financial support from The Radcliffe Trust. The inventory evaluated 169 crafts and all are graded along the model of animal species at risk, using categories: least concern, endangered, critically endangered, near-extinct and extinct. The second edition of the Red List was published on 9 March 2019, with 212 crafts evaluated; the critically endangered list increased to 36 crafts. 102 crafts were classified as currently viable. Red List The HCA Red List, originally known as the Radcliffe Red List, was modelled on the IUCN Red List and other such inventories, and was influenced by UNESCO's work on the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage. The United Kingdom is one of only a few countries whose intangible cultural heritage is not yet recognised by UNESCO. The publication, which took two years to compile, was launched at the House of Lords and was subsequently featured in various media, including BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour. It is the first report of its kind in the UK, although an earlier general analysis of the heritage craft sector and its contribution to the economy in England was undertaken in 2012 by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The report identifies a heritage craft as ‚Äúa practice which employs manual dexterity and skill and an understanding of traditional materials, design and techniques, and which has been practised for two or more successive generations‚Äù. It also summarises some of the reasons for the decline of heritage crafts in the UK including the difficulties recruiting apprentices, the increased age of the artisan workforce, high prices for articles made by hand and an overall decline in demand. Greta Bertram, who managed the original report, identified one of the principle aims of the report was to bring pressure upon the government to help preserve the crafts for the future, saying, Whilst heritage conservation has gained widespread popularity over the last century, preserving buildings and architecture for the future, the HCA has championed craft skills as part of British cultural heritage for similar preservation, and hopes to use the Red List to inform policy decisions on where to invest future funding. The foreword to the original Red List was written by the Prince of Wales in his capacity as President of the Heritage Crafts Association, stating, The second edition of the Red List was published in March 2019 and watchmaking joined the critically endangered category, with fewer than 30 watchmakers able to commercially create a watch from scratch. It is hoped that its inclusion may encourage the UK to become a signatory of UNESCO‚Äôs Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. Extinct crafts In the 2019 edition of the Red List, four crafts were identified as having been already lost in the UK in the preceding decade: *goldbeating, *the making of cricket balls, *traditional lacrosse stick manufacturing, and *paper mould and deckle making, a form of specialised papermaking. The last British goldbeaters, W. Habberley Meadows, and Dukes Cricket Balls of London both stopped production in the UK after being unable to recruit an apprentice, having both suffered the effects of cheaper foreign competition. The original Red List included the manufacture of riddles, a kind of sieve. Following the publication of the report in 2017, however, two individuals came forward to revive the craft, one of whom persuaded the last riddle maker to train them, despite him having retired. The trainees are currently attempting to become commercially viable, thus removing the craft from the extinct category. Paper mould and deckle making was added to extinct category in the 2019 following the death of the last UK maker Ron MacDonald in 2017. Critically endangered crafts At the time of the report's release in 2017, there were seventeen traditional crafts in the 'critically endangered' category, defined as having no trainees to continue the skills involved and as being practiced by either a very small number of artisans or produced by two or fewer companies in the UK. Following the closure of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry (Britain's oldest manufacturing company dating from 1570), bell founding was added to the 2019 list, one of 36 critically endangered crafts: *basketwork furniture making *bell founding *clay pipe making *clog making with hand-carved soles *damask weaving *Devon maund making *fan making *Fair Isle straw backed chair making *flute making *fore-edge painting *hat plaiting *horse collar making *kishie basket making *maille making *metal thread making *millwrighting *oak bark tanning *orrery making *paper making (commercial handmade) *parchment and vellum making *piano making *plane making *pottery (industrial) *reverse glass sign painting *saw making *scissor making *shinty caman making *sieve and riddle making *spade making (forged heads) *spinning wheel making *swill basket making *tinsmithing *wainwrighting *watch face enamelling *watchmaking *withy pot making See also * Craft Northern Ireland * Living Human Treasure * Rural crafts  References  External links *HCA Red List of Endangered Crafts *The Radcliffe Trust Category:Traditional knowledge Category:Craft occupations Category:Labour in the United Kingdom ","title":"HCA Red List of Endangered Crafts"},{"id":"58857197","text":"Wandal is a village in the southern state of Karnataka, India.

Although terrestrial, they are capable swimmers, able to remain submerged for up to 22 minutes and having even been caught in gill nets set at sea.http://www.floridainvasives.org/Heartland/links/TeguBioprofileSep2006.pdf Biomechanical studies have shown that tegus have stronger limb bones than comparably-sized mammals or birds, a trait that may be inherent to amphibians and reptiles. They exhibit social and maternal behaviour; female tegus construct burrows to lay their eggs in, and will protect their brood until they hatch. Up to 35 eggs are produced in a clutch.http://www.myfwc.com/media/2380549/Tegu-brochure.pdf Tegus will hibernate together in groups, though males exhibit territorial behavior towards each other.http://www.lvzoo.org/animal-profiles/tegu.cfm Tegus exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males display greatly expanded and prominent \\"jowls\\" along the base of the lower jaw. These jowls are the result of extensive growth of the ventral pterygoideus muscles (a prominent jaw closing muscle in reptiles).Rieppel, O. 1980.

California. U. Cal. Press. male tegus show both greater relative and absolute muscle mass compared to females. Further evidence for sexual selection of these jowls comes from observations that ventral pterygoideus muscle mass increases in males during the reproductive season. Metabolic changes also occur during the reproductive season, in which the body temperature is increased up to 10 degrees Celsius and sustained internally like a bird or a mammal. This discovery has major evolutionary implications, providing support for the hypothesis that endothermy may have evolved in response to parental care. Ecology Tegus are omnivorous, foraging for a wide range of foods using their forked tongues, including fruit, fungi, various arthropods, small vertebrates, carrion, and eggs. The amount of meat that is consumed by tegus decreases as the animals mature. As adults, tegus have few predators. Among them are big cats, birds of prey and large snakes. Tegus defend themselves using their powerful jaws, which can exert forces of up to 1000N.Aggressive Behavior and Performance in the Tegu Lizard Tupinambis merianae: Anthony Herrel, Denis V. Andrade, Jos√© Eduardo de Carvalho, Ananda Brito, Augusto Abe, and Carlos Navas - Physiological and Biochemical Zoology Vol. 82, No. 6 (November/December 2009), pp. 680-685 A bite from an adult tegu can crush human fingers. Though more terrestrial (morphologically less well-adapted for climbing into tree canopies or for swimming), tegus fill an ecological niche in South America similar to that filled by monitor lizards in Africa, Asia and Australia, and are an example of convergent evolution. Though similar in appearance to monitors, tegus are not closely related and can be distinguished by their larger heads, shorter necks, heavier bodies and different arrangement of the scales on the body and tail. Monitors have laterally compressed tails, well-suited for aquatic propulsion, while tegus' tails are more cylindrical or even broader than high. In addition, tegus are facultative bipeds, while monitors are obligate quadrupeds.Monitors and Tegus, R. D. Bartlett and Patricia P. Bartlett Economic importance and environmental impact Tegus are among the most commercially exploited reptiles in the world. Up to 1,000,000 are harvested annually in their native Argentina for their hide and meat, and are particularly important as a source of income in rural or indigenous communities. Tegus can also be found in captivity, where they are bred for the pet trade. They are reported to be highly intelligent, becoming docile as they mature and in some cases even ignoring food in favor of social interaction. However, tegus have demanding husbandry requirements due to their large size. Within their native range, tegus are often thought of as pests, sometimes raiding chicken coops to feed on the eggs or fowl.Guide to Lizards, Robert G. Sprackland, Ph.D. They are noted predators of ground nesting bird and crocodilian eggs, and in some areas 80% of spectacled caiman nests are destroyed by tegus. In South Florida, they have become an invasive species, and prey on the eggs of American alligators instead. Predation by feral tegus may pose a threat to Florida's endangered wildlife, such as the Key Largo woodrat and the American crocodile. Due to their fruit eating habits, tegus may serve an important ecological function by dispersing seeds through their droppings.

It was designed by the Colonial Architect‚Äôs Office under James Barnet and built by Goddard and Pittman. The property is owned by Australia Post, an agency of the Australian Government. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  Redfern's natural landscape was defined by sand hills and swamps. The Carrahdigang, more widely known as the Cadigal people, valued the area for its abundant supply of food. The name Redfern originates from an early land grant to William Redfern in 1817. It was previously known as Roberts Farm and Boxley's Swamp. The majority of houses in Redfern in the 1850s were of timber. From the 1850s market gardeners congregated in Alexandria south of McEvoy Street, around Shea's Creek and Bourke Road. In 1885 the Sands Sydney Directory listed 54 market gardens. While many were worked by European-Australians, by the 1870s Chinese market gardeners had acquired leases in the district and a decade later were dominating the trade. The passing of the Sydney Slaughterhouses Act in 1849 brought other businesses to the district. This act banned abattoirs and noxious trades from the city. Tanners, wool scourers and wool-washers, fellmongers, boiling down works and abattoirs had 10 years to move their businesses outside city boundaries. Many of the trades moved to Redfern and Waterloo - attracted by the water. The sand hills still existed but by the late 1850s Redfern was a flourishing suburb housing 6,500 people. The Municipalities Act of 1858 gave districts the option of municipal incorporation. Public meetings were held and after a flurry of petitions Redfern Municipality was proclaimed on August 11, 1859, the fourth in Sydney to be formed under the Act. Redfern Town Hall opened in 1870 and the Albert Cricket Ground in 1864. Redfern Post Office came in 1882. The Eveleigh Railway complex in 1886 became one of the largest employers in the state. Redfern was an industrial working class suburb by the end of the 19th century. Reschs brewery and other factories attracted migrants. The Syrian/Lebanese community began settling around Redfern and Surry Hills by the 1880s. In the 1940s 73 per cent of all industrial activity in Sydney was concentrated within a radius of from Redfern railway station. Many of its services have disappeared or been substantially downgraded over the last couple of decades, even though Redfern is still a densely populated inner city suburb.Murray, 2009, 5 Postal services The first official postal service in Australia was established in April 1809, when the Sydney merchant Isaac Nichols was appointed as the first Postmaster in the colony of NSW. Prior to this, mail had been distributed directly by the captain of the ship on which the mail arrived, however this system was neither reliable nor secure. In 1825 the colonial administration was empowered to establish a Postmaster General's Department, which had previously been administered from Britain. In 1828 the first post offices outside of Sydney were established, with offices in Bathurst, Campbelltown, Parramatta, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith and Windsor. By 1839 there were forty post offices in the colony, with more opened as settlement spread. During the 1860s, the advance of postal services was further increased as the railway network began to be established throughout NSW. In 1863, the Postmaster General W. H. Christie noted that accommodation facilities for Postmasters in some post offices was quite limited, and stated that it was a matter of importance that \\"post masters should reside and sleep under the same roof as the office\\". The first telegraph line was opened in Victoria in March 1854 and in NSW in 1858. The NSW colonial government constructed two lines from the GPO, one to the South Head Signal Station, the other to Liverpool. Development was slow in NSW compared to the other states, with the Government concentrating on the development of country offices before suburban ones. As the line spread, however, telegraph offices were built to accommodate the operators. Unlike the Post Office, the telegraph office needed specialised equipment and could not be easily accommodated in a local store or private residence. Post and telegraph offices operated separately until 1870 when the departments were amalgamated, after which time new offices were built to include both postal and telegraph services. In 1881 the first telephone exchange was opened in Sydney, three years after the first tests in Adelaide. As with the telegraph, the telephone system soon began to extend into country areas, with telephone exchanges appearing in country NSW from the late 1880s onwards. Again the Post Office was responsible for the public telephone exchange, further emphasising its place in the community as a provider of communications services. The appointment of James Barnet as Acting Colonial Architect in 1862 coincided with a considerable increase in funding to the public works program. Between 1865 and 1890 the Colonial Architects Office was responsible for the building and maintenance of 169 Post Offices and telegraph offices in NSW. The post offices constructed during this period featured in a variety of architectural styles, as Barnet argued that the local parliamentary representatives always preferred \\"different patterns\\". The construction of new post offices continued throughout the Depression years under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon, who held office from 1890 to 1911. While twenty-seven post offices were built between 1892 and 1895, funding to the Government Architect's Office was cut from 1893 to 1895, causing Vernon to postpone a number of projects. Following Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth Government took over responsibility for post, telegraph and telephone offices, with the Department of Home Affairs Works Division being made responsible for post office construction. In 1916 construction was transferred to the Department of Works and Railways, with the Department of the Interior responsible during World War II. On 22 December 1975, the Postmaster General's Department was abolished and replaced by the Post and Telecommunications Department. This was the creation of Telecom and Australia Post. In 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Act established Australia Post as a self-funding entity, heralding a new direction in property management, including a move away from the larger more traditional buildings towards smaller shop front style post offices. For much of its history, the post office has been responsible for a wide variety of community services including mail distribution, an agency for the Commonwealth Savings Bank, electoral enrolments, and the provision of telegraph and telephone services. The town post office has served as a focal point for the community, most often built in a prominent position in the centre of town close to other public buildings, creating a nucleus of civic buildings and community pride. Redfern Post Office Although the first land grants in Redfern were made in 1817 to Dr William Redfern by Governor Macquarie, it was not until the 1840s and 1850s that a suburb began to develop. The construction of the first railway in Sydney, with its terminus at Redfern encouraged the growth of the suburb, with Redfern being proclaimed a municipality on 11 August 1859. Between 1851 and 1891, the population of the suburb nearly doubled every decade, with the suburb having the second highest density of population per acre in Sydney, exceeded only by the adjacent suburb of Darlington. The first post office in Redfern was opened in Pitt Street, Redfern on 1 July 1856, following the closure of the Chippendale office. During this period, as with most other branches of post offices, the office was run from a rented premise. On 1 October 1871 a branch of the Government Saving Bank opened at Redfern Post Office, followed in by the introduction of the money order system. The allowance to issue money orders saw Redfern announced as an official Post Office in 1875. The status of official post office then gave impetus to calls for a government-owned post office to be erected in the suburb. The Municipal Council made the first representations to the government for the erection of an office post office building in August 1878. Following the Council's petition, a block of land was secured in Redfern Street for the construction of a post office. The lot had a frontage to Redfern Street and to George Street, Redfern. The land was purchased at A‚Ç§15 per . In November 1878, Postal Inspector Moyse visited Redfern to inspect the proposed construction site. Moyse suggested a second site in Botany Road for the Post Office, while the GPO Secretary suggested that the search for the site be put to tender. Tenders were called, during which the Council again offered the Redfern Street site which was accepted by the Postmaster General on 9 January 1879. Following the Postmaster General's decision, the Colonial Architect's Office was authorised to proceed with the drawing of plans for the new office at an estimated cost of A‚Ç§3,000. The new post office included a telegraph office, parlour, drawing room, three bedrooms, kitchen, servant's room, bathroom, scullery, washhouse, fuel shed and two stall stables. In 1880, A‚Ç§3,000 was placed on the Parliamentary Estimates for the erection of the Redfern office. The plans for the new building were submitted to Public Works prior to the commencement of any work on the site. The Public Works added a clock tower for an estimated extra A‚Ç§700. The Postmaster General put the new design out to tender with Messrs Goddard and Pittman's tender for A‚Ç§3,692 being accepted on 6 October 1881. Redfern Post Office was completed by 29 January 1883 and occupied on 31 January. On 16 April 1904 a new telephone exchange room was added at a total cost of A‚Ç§203. A separate Telephone Exchange building was constructed next door to the Post Office on Redfern Street in , which echoes the architectural style of the Post Office. In the conversion of the residence's dining room and kitchen into a ground floor mail room was undertaken, involving the removal of some of the original fixtures, including fireplaces and the centre wall. A porch at the eastern end of the northern facade was also created at this time. Other work on the office included the removal of the single-storey southern section, some time after 1938, and the replacement of the original slate roof with red tiles as well as the removal of the chimneys and the closure of the fireplaces in the s.  Description  Redfern Post Office is a landmark feature of the Redfern area, located on a prominent corner looking towards the city. Built in 1882, Redfern Post Office is a two-storey Victorian Italianate building with a dominant four and half-storey corner clock tower and is constructed in flush rendered brickwork with cut-render quoining. The building has a later red-tiled hipped roof with bracketed eaves, corrugated-iron and rolled-zinc skillion, and flat roof sections set behind balustraded parapets. There are no chimneys retained on the building. The tower has four clock faces located on each face of the fourth storey, below a squat belvedere capped by a domed copper roof and above single lancet windows in each face of the third floor. Each clock face has black writing on a white background. As the tower was inaccessible at the time of inspection, it is not known whether the original clock mechanism is still intact. Access to the tower appears to be via a series of timber ladders from the window off the first-floor roof. Attached to the rear of the building are three, later, single-storey additions. The rendered and painted brick section (as shown in Image 7) contains the male bathroom and there is an external storage shed attached to it on the southern side. The third, single-storey face brick addition is between and abuts the multi-storey Telstra building and the Post Office. There are three porches on the ground floor of Redfern Post Office, forming public entries beneath the corner tower and at the eastern corner, with a disused entry to the former post boxes porch on the western facade. The floors to all three porches have modern red tiles, concrete steps, and terrazzo doorway thresholds, with some new aluminium handrails attached to the corner entry. The building has a rendered finish, painted in a tan and maroon colour scheme and the window frames have been painted dark green. The ground floor is dominated by moulded arched detailing with prominent keystones and pilasters, and ashlar cut render to the base of the tower and the eastern end of the northern facade. There is a continuous moulded string course cutting across the arched windows of the first floor, with another at the level of the main roof eaves on the corner tower. Metal grilles are located within the eastern end opening of the northern facade and the southern openings of the western facade, and there is a new wrought-steel gate at the laneway. The southern balustrade section of the western facade appears to be original. Windows to the street facades of the building comprise tall, arched timber sash windows, both paired and single, spaced evenly around the building. The interior of the ground floor of Redfern Post Office comprises four main areas. These include the carpeted retail and office areas, and the sheet-vinyl-floored mail rooms and staff facilities. There is modern tiling in the male bathroom. The ceilings of the ground floor are a combination of set plaster in the stairwell, plasterboard with a coved cornice in the lunchroom and plaster with a moulded cornice in the mail rooms, hall entry and retail area. Most of the painted ceilings have severe peeling. There are large pendant lights in the retail and office areas, with a ceiling fan and exposed air conditioning ducting. The remainder of this level has suspended and attached fluorescent lighting and air conditioning ducting. The retail area ceiling has been painted pink, and the remainder painted green. Architraves appear to be original to original openings, with modern trim to later openings. Large sections of original or early skirting have been retained, with some cut render skirting to the western wall of the retail area. Windows on the ground floor are tall timber sash windows with arched top sashes. Some four panel original or early doors have been retained to this level, however the majority of internal doors are modern flush and half-glazed doors. Walls are rendered and painted masonry, with timber veneer partitions in the retail area and asbestos cement sheet infill walls within the stair hall. The ground- floor colour scheme incorporates tan coloured walls with white trim and two chimney breasts have been retained, though bricked in. The central stair comprises original turned timber posts and balusters painted white, with a shaped rail, carved and painted end brackets and sheet vinyl treads. There is a modern tubular steel rail attached to the wall and original or early timber panelling encloses the storeroom below the stair. The original first-floor residence of Redfern Post Office is currently vacant and has sheet-vinyl- flooring, excepting the tiled female bathroom and locker room in the southeastern corner, which are still utilised. The western storeroom currently has a mail chute installed in the floor which accesses the ground floor. The first-floor ceilings comprise a variety of types and all have been painted green. These include board and batten ceilings with a flat strip cornice to the locker room and ladies bathroom; plasterboard with a coved cornice in the southeastern corner section of hall; and pressed metal with a moulded cornice in the hall, northeastern, northwestern and southwestern rooms. There is square set plaster in the western storeroom and plaster with a moulded cornice in the western end of the stair landing. The first floor has attached fluorescent lighting and ceiling fans, with suspended fluorescent lighting in the northeastern room, and there is a single air conditioning unit in the northeastern room on the ceiling. This level retains predominantly original skirting, with later wide skirting to partition walls, all trims being painted white. Architraves appear to be original or early to original openings. Windows on the street facades of the first floor are tall, double hung sash windows with arched top sashes, as found on the ground floor. There are squared sash windows in the stair hall and the southern wall of the northeastern room. The internal doors are four panelled, some with modifications, and there are loading doors adjacent to the hoist in the eastern wall of the northeastern room. The walls are rendered and painted masonry, painted tan with white trim and there are partition walls dividing the northeastern and northwestern rooms. The modern hoist in the northeastern room is still operable, and is attached diagonally to the walls. There is a curved section of rendered wall in the stair hall that follows through to the ground floor. Three chimney breasts retained on the first-floor level have been bricked in. Signage to Redfern Post Office is limited to standard Australia Post signs attached over the north facade eastern side entry and at the southern end of the western facade, with street signs attached to the base of the tower at first-floor level. The lettering \\"Redfern Post Office 1882\\" is centred over the inset arched windows of the northern facade. The surrounding streetscape comprises predominantly two to multi-storey retail, commercial and residential mixed use buildings, primarily twentieth-century, but with some late nineteenth-century buildings. The Post Office abuts the intrusive, multi- storey Telstra building to the south and the former telephone exchange to the east, which matches the style of the Post Office. Both of these buildings fully enclose the concreted rear yard of the Post Office. There are some street trees in the area, however none in close proximity to the Post Office, which is surrounded by concrete footpaths. The only outbuilding associated with the Post Office is the small attached brick shed at the southeastern corner of the building.  Condition  As at 4 August 2000, the building is generally in very good condition. Archaeological potential of the site is considered fair. The exterior form of Redfern Post Office is largely intact, with some modifications to the rear over time, and the addition of painted render. The interior has undergone extensive change, which has been concentrated largely on the ground floor with the introduction of larger public areas and mail room facilities. The first floor has also undergone some changes, but a greater extent of original fabric and layout remain. Redfern Post Office retains the features which make it culturally significant, which includes the prominent corner clock tower and the overall style, form and scale of the building.  Modifications and dates  The original Post Office building comprised two storeys, with a residence on the upper floor and in the rear of the building, and a corner clocktower. It is possible that the original building had open colonnade sections to each facade that have since been infilled. Conversion of the residence's dining room and kitchen into the rear ground-floor mailroom occurred and involved the removal of the original fireplaces and centre wall. At this time, the porch at the eastern end of the northern facade was also created. The date of the removal of the single-storey southern section of the building is unknown, although it was some time after 1938. Removal of the original slate roof and replacement with red tiles, probably occurred at the same time as the removal of the chimneys and bricking in of the fireplaces, possibly s-60s. This is also possibly when the removal of dormers in the copper clocktower roof occurred. The date of the removal of the post boxes from the western facade porch is unknown, although it appears to have occurred quite recently. The neighbouring multi-storey Telstra building on George Street is also a recent construction.  Further information  The building is generally in very good condition, with the exception of the severe peeling paint in the interior of both floors. Archaeological potential of the site is considered fair, as there has been considerable work carried out on and around the site since first construction. Evidence of early structures or land use however, could be retained within the currently concreted yard and laneway.  Heritage listing  As at 4 August 2000, Redfern Post Office is significant at a State level for its historical associations, aesthetic qualities and social meaning. Redfern Post Office is associated with the early development of Redfern Municipality, as it is linked with the original postal services established in the area in 1856. Redfern Post Office reflects the rapid population growth of the area during the latter part of the nineteenth century, which resulted in the need for an improved level of services to the local residents. It has been the centre of communications for the local community for over a century. Paired with the adjacent former Telephone Exchange building, Redfern Post Office provides an insight into the development of communications services in NSW. Redfern Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a substantial example of the Victorian Italianate style, and makes an important aesthetic contribution to central Redfern as a dominant nineteenth century public building. Redfern Post Office is also associated with the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet, a key practitioner of the Victorian Italianate style of architecture. Redfern Post Office is also considered to be significant to the community of Redfern's sense of place.v Redfern Post Office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.

Redfern Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a substantial example of the Victorian Italianate style, and makes an important aesthetic contribution to central Redfern as a dominant nineteenth century public building. It compares in style and form with Kempsey (1886), Hay (1882) and Forbes (1881) Post Offices, although Redfern is larger in scale. The scale, architectural style and location of the building, along with the prominent corner clock tower, also make it a focal point defining the centre of Redfern, endowing it with landmark qualities. The adjacent Telephone Exchange is architecturally sympathetic to the Post Office, and together add to the character of the corner of Redfern and George Street. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Redfern Post Office is a prominent civic building and a local landmark, and has been the centre of communications for the area for over a century. As such, it is considered to be important to the Redfern community's sense of place. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has some potential to contain archaeological information relating to the previous use of the site and the evolution of the building and outbuildings associated with the use by the Post Office. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Redfern Post Office is a particularly strong example of the Victorian Italianate style of architecture. The large massing of Redfern Post Office gives an unusual prominence to the tall corner clock tower. The adjacent Telephone Exchange appears to be largely intact, and is considered to be rare surviving example of early twentieth century exchange buildings. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Redfern Post Office is part of the group of nineteenth-century Victorian Italianate post offices in NSW designed by the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet.

In January 1910, on instruction from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, HM Treasury passed responsibility for North Sea fishery investigations to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (later MAFF), who in-turn were required to come to an agreement with the Marine Biological Association (MBA) as to how scientific investigations could continue into the future, in support of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). On 1 April 1910 staff at the fisheries laboratory in Lowestoft moved to 43 Parliament Street, London, becoming civil servants. The Association closed the Lowestoft fisheries laboratory and sold the RV Huxley. Consequently, from then onwards the now London-based staff were forced to make their research voyages aboard chartered commercial vessels. During the course of the financial year 1912-13 however, an extra grant was made available in order to allow the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to charter the steam yacht Hildegarde for a series of dedicated studies into the adverse consequences of trawling on herring populations. This was in response to fears raised by parts of the industry at a public meeting held at Great Yarmouth in October 1912. These herring investigations used a variety of different nets including Shrimp trawl, Otter trawl, and herring drift nets. The vessel operated throughout the southern North Sea, but in particular on herring fishing grounds around the Wash and the north Norfolk coast, most notably Saltfleet, Lynn Deep, Lynn Well, Boston Deep, Mablethorpe, Dudsen, and Cromer. A second grant was made available for vessel charter in the following financial year (1913-1914), to allow these studies on the SY Hildegarde to continue. By 1914 the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries also started to make use of the steam yacht Hiawatha (Captain W.H. Stewart). Surveys were made throughout the southern North Sea (as far North as the Northumberland coast, along the Dutch coast and around East Anglia) focused on plankton sampling and demersal fish resources ‚Äì using a variety of bottom trawl nets. Nearly all of this work came to an abrupt end in August 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War. Scientist‚Äôs logbooks from these historical surveys are now held by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) in Lowestoft and datasets have recently been digitized as part of the Trawling through Time initiative. Additional survey work was carried out by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries on sprat and small herring (whitebait) in 1915 and 1916 aboard the chartered fishing vessel SS Unity (LO 170) although restricted to the East Anglian coast and Thames estuary. Further details about SY Hildegarde and SY Hiawatha Bow, McLachlan and Company was a Scottish marine engineering and shipbuilding company that traded between 1872 and 1932. Ships built in 1904 included the 206grt/205TM steam yacht Hildegarde, commissioned by John Denison-Pender, 1st Baron Pender. Following charter by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1912 and before the first World War, the SY Hildegarde was renamed as the Managem. On 15 January 1917 she was requisitioned by the Admiralty and armed with a 12 pdr naval gun. She served in the ‚Äòspecial yacht squadron‚Äô as a wireless-equipped armed patrol Group Leader and operated throughout the Mediterranean and Gulf of Suez. Notably she was stationed off Atlit in Israel and used to relay espionage messages from operatives onshore. In April 1917, a new captain, Lieutenant Kane, was appointed to the Managem, while Captain Lewen Weldon represented British intelligence on board. One of Weldon‚Äôs tasks was to deposit agents and spies on the shores of Palestine and Syria and to transmit telegraphic messages from the ship to British central intelligence in Cairo. Eventually it was decided to withdraw her and to use homing pigeons to convey this information, due to the presence of German submarines in the area. HMS Managem was included on two Admiralty ‚ÄòPink Lists‚Äô (compiled every three to four days to show the stations and movements of ships) from 30 June 1918 and 11 November 1918. The vessel is recorded as being one of several ‚ÄòAuxiliary Patrol Yachts‚Äô located in Egypt and the Red Sea. SY Hiawatha was built as the steam yacht Nora by Charles Mitchell & Co, Low Walker, Newcastle Upon Tyne. She was launched on 21 December 1879 (Yard Number 392), but was renamed as the SY Hiawatha in 1888 when she was taken into the ownership of Donald Horne Macfarlane and re-registered in Southampton. Her dimensions were 339grt, 219nrt, 176.8 x 26.1 x 13.4ft and she was powered by a single screw propeller and a steam engine constructed by R & W Hawthorn, Newcastle. Over her long lifetime she had many changes of ownership and name changes (and was variously known as the Clara, Polygon, La Valette, Akbas and Yeni Gundogdu), but between 1913 and 1915 she had reverted to the name Hiawatha and was owned by Noel Pemberton Billing and registered in London. In 1916 she was converted to a salvage vessel and between November 1917 to 1919 she was employed on Admiralty service as the La Valette. She was eventually (in 1966) converted into a cargo vessel and ended her life as B. Kartal in Turkey, where she was finally broken up in 1982.
