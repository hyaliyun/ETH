They are generally held to be part of Eutriconodonta. Biology Like many other non-therian mammals, gobiconodonts retained classical mammalian synapomorphies like epipubic bones (and likely the associated reproductive constrictions), venomous spurs and sprawling limbs. However, the forelimb and shoulder anatomy of at least some species like Jeholodens are similar to those of therian mammals, though the hindlimbs remain more conservative. Gobiconodonts had a modern ear anatomy, the main difference from therians being that the ear ossicles were still somewhat connected to the jaw via the Meckel's cartilage. Some information on gobiconodont soft-tissues can be seen in Spinolestes, which was very well preserved, showing evidence of fur and internal organs. Spinolestes shows hair similar to that of modern mammals, with compound hair follicles with primary and secondary hair, even preserving traces of a pore infection. It also possesses a clear thoracic diaphragm like modern mammals, as well as spines, dermal scutes and an ossified Meckel's cartilage. The gobiconodont triconodont dentition has no analogue among living mammals, so comparisons are difficult. However, its clear that most if not all gobiconodonts were primarily carnivorous, given the presence of long, sharp canines and fang-like incisors, premolars with trenchant main cusps that were well suited to grasp and pierce prey, strong development of the madibular abductor musculature, bone crushing ability in at least some species and several other features. Gobiconodonts are often among the largest mammals in Mesozoic faunal assemblages, displaying a broad size range from small shrew-like insectivores to large forms like Repenomamus and Gobiconodon. They were among the first mammals to be specialised for vertebrate prey, and likely occupied the highest trophic levels among mammals in their faunal communities. Several forms like Gobiconodon and Repenomamus show evidence of scavenging, being among the few Mesozoic mammals to have significantly exploited that. At least in carnivorous niches, gobiconodonts were probably replaced by deltatheroidean metatherians, which are the dominant carnivorous mammals in Late Cretaceous faunal assemblages. Competition between both groups is unattested, but in Asia the Early Cretaceous gobiconodontid diversity is replaced entirely by a deltatheroidean one, while in North America Nanocuris appears after the absence of Gobiconodon and other larger eutriconodonts. Given that all insectivorous and carnivorous mammals groups suffered heavy losses during the mid-Cretaceous, it seems likely these metatherians simply occupied niches left after the extinction of eutriconodonts. At least Spinolestes had xenarthrous vertebrae and osseous scutes, convergent to those of modern xenarthrans and to a lesser extent the hero shrew. Uniquely among crown-group mammals, gobiconodontids replaced their molariform teeth by successors of similar complexity, while in other mammals less complex replacements are the norm.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/spp2.1329 Classification Cladogram after Averianov & Lopatin, 2011: Gobiconodonta was named by Averianov & Lopatin (2011); according to the authors it contained two families of mammals (gobiconodontids and klameliids) that were traditionally assigned to Eutriconodonta. The exact phylogenetic position of these families within Mammaliaformes is uncertain. Some analyses using only dental and mandibular characters (the first analysis of Gao et al., 2010, Meng, Wang & Li, 2011, Averianov & Lopatin, 2011) found that gobiconodonts and eutriconodonts did not form a clade that wouldn't also include trechnotherians; however, some other analyses of dental and mandibular characters (Gaetano and Rougier, 2011, 2012) did recover gobiconodontids as eutriconodonts. The analysis conducted by Luo et al. (2007) and the second analysis of Gao et al. (2010), involving a broader range of Mesozoic mammaliaforms and more characters (including postcranial ones) recovered gobiconodontids as eutriconodonts as well. However, Gao et al. (2010) stressed that jeholodentids and gobiconodontids are the only eutriconodonts with known postcranial skeletons; according to the authors, it remains uncertain whether the results of their second analysis represent true phylogeny or are merely \\"a by-product of long branch attraction of jeholodentids and gobiconodontids\\". Most recent analysis recover them as eutriconodonts, closer to triconodontids and their immediate outgroups than to amphilestids: NotesReferences Triconodonts Taxa named by Alexander O.

There are plans to add a new training hub called SPIRE East in Middle River, Maryland. The sports academy offers a professional preparatory experience for the sports of basketball, swimming and track and field. In addition to the academy, SPIRE offers camp programs for a wide variety of sports including soccer, football, esports and drones. Their facilities have been used for championship conferences and as training centers for Olympic athletes. SPIRE produced and worked with athletes such as LaMelo Ball, Ryan Lochte, Dwight Phillips, Elizabeth Beisel, Tianna Bartoletta, Caeleb Dressel, and Tim Mack. The goal of the partnership with SPIRE and the ambassadors is to emphasize the development of peak performance in atheltics, academics, character and life. History SPIRE Institute and Academy first opened in 2009 as the GaREAT Sports Complex. At this time there was one building featured a synthetic turf field used for multiple sports including soccer, football and more. In January 2010, the track and field complex was opened for athletes. A second outdoor track and field and outdoor sports complex opened in 2012. On February 23, 2013, SPIRE was declared an Olympic and Paralympic training site by Alicia McConnell, director of training sites and community partnerships for the U.S. Olympic Committee. In February 2014, SPIRE became the designated training site for USA Wrestling, the United States Olympic team. In January 2020, SPIRE was sold to Axxella, a company affiliated with Blue Ocean Realty. There are plans to expand their current programs and offerings. In September of 2020, it was announced that new dormitories are being added to the campus, in addition to five new basketball courts and an e-gaming area.

The International Marxist Group (IMG) was a Trotskyist group in Britain between 1968 and 1982. It was the British Section of the Fourth International. It had around 1,000 members and supporters in the late 1970s.Description for the papers of the International Marxist Group, Warwick University Library. In 1980, it had 682 members;International Information Bulletin 1980 No. 1 by 1982, when it changed its name to the Socialist League, membership had fallen to 534.International Information Bulletin 1983 #1  Origins  The IMG emerged from the International Group, a sympathising organisation of the International Secretariat of the Fourth International (IS). Its founders, Pat Jordan and Ken Coates, had broken with the CPGB in Nottingham in 1956. They were members of the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL) in the late 1950s (which was later renamed Militant), Jordan becoming organising secretary. In 1961, they split to form the Internationalist Group in support of the IS against the leadership of the RSL, its British section. In 1963, the ISFI reunited with the majority of the International Committee of the Fourth International as the United Secretariat which advised the RSL and Internationalist Group to unite. A unity conference in September 1964, brokered partly by Pierre Frank and Jimmy Deane, voted for unity but the fusion was not accepted: RSL member Peter Taaffe recalls that he \\"led a walk-out of the Liverpool delegation, with the majority in Liverpool in support\\".Peter Taaffe, Militant's Real History , at socialistworld.net Very soon the former Internationalist Group members left to form a new organisation, the International Group, together with some former members of the Socialist Labour League (SLL) who had opposed that organisation's refusal to take part in the 1963 reunification of the majorities of the Fourth International, including Charlie van Gelderen. The Group played a major role in raising Vietnam solidarity at the 1965 Labour Party conference. The 1965 World Congress of the International demoted the RSL to a \\"sympathising\\" group: the International Group was granted the same status. In the words of the RSL's Peter Taaffe, \\"We decided that the time had arrived when we must turn our backs on this organisation.\\" The RSL left the FI, and ultimately became the Militant Tendency, or just Militant. The International Group continued the production of a cyclostyled bulletin known as The Week. As it was engaged in entryism inside the Labour Party, this journal gained various sponsors including Bertrand Russell, whose Russell Tribunal employed two members of the Canadian section of the FI, Ernie Tate and Pat Brain. In early 1968, the International Group renamed itself as the International Marxist Group. The IMG's activists published International, which was launched in May 1968 with IMG secretary Pat Jordan as editor and incorporated The Week. It was published with varying formats and frequencies throughout the organisation's life. Socialist Woman magazine was published from 1969 to 1980. The evolving orientations taken by the IMG were reflected in the sequence of newspapers it supported: The Black Dwarf; Red Mole; Red Weekly; Socialist Challenge; and Socialist Action. =The Black Dwarf= The Black Dwarf was launched in June 1968 under Tariq Ali's editorship, with several other IMG members on its editorial board. Its creative and pluralist nature attracted a number of new activists to the group: John Lennon was friendly to the organisation. While IMG members largely remained in the Labour Party, including Charlie van Gelderen, International marked a break from 'deep entrism'. Its first issue claimed that \\"The Week was brought out in the expectation that a mass left would arise in the Labour party once labour was in power. [Its] main function was that of an organiser and co-ordinator [...] but this will be a by-product of the main function of International: the creation of a firm marxist core in the labour movement.\\" Its campaigning was focussed on broader initiatives such as the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign and the Russell Tribunal, in which Ernie Tate was prominent and in which the RSL and Socialist Labour League did not work, the Institute for Workers' Control and the Revolutionary Socialist Students Front, in which Peter Gowan and Murray Smith were active. The agitational work of The Week was carried on in The Black Dwarf and in Socialist Woman, launched in 1969. The Group gained some public prominence when Tariq Ali, who had joined in April 1968, was widely publicised in the media as a leader of protests against the Vietnam War. After the IMG became the British section of the Fourth International in May 1969, International started to be formally presented as the publication of the IMG. The group began to focus on work in the student movement and trade unions. It abandoned its earlier systematic entryist work within the Labour Party, although the IMG continuously operated a \\"fraction\\" to organise its members within the Party. This turn out from the party led to a small number of members, including Al Richardson, being marginalised: they went on to form the Revolutionary Communist League, better known as the Chartists. The IMG was quickly noted for its energetic support for international solidarity campaigns concerning Vietnam, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, South Africa, and its support for socialists facing repression in France, Bolivia and Mexico, support for which was organised through the Black Dwarf. International's May 1969 famous headline \\"Permanent Revolution Reaches UK\\" reflected its support for armed self-defence against the British state's forces in Northern Ireland in the Red Weekly and in its propaganda activity. It also supported, in orthodox Trotskyist fashion, the Communist-influenced struggles of the MPLA in Angola, FRELIMO in Mozambique and the ANC in South Africa despite the complete contempt of the Communist parties for Trotskyists: some opponents nicknamed them 'MIGs', after the Soviet military MiG. In domestic politics, the early 1970s saw the IMG completely reject parliamentary politics. In 1970, the group used the general election as an opportunity to make revolutionary propaganda rather than canvassing for the return of a Labour government. =Red Mole= Red Mole supported the IRA's para-military campaign > For the New Zealand Theatre Company, see Red Mole (Theatre Company) In March 1970, The Black Dwarf's editorial board split over questions of Leninism. A second newspaper was established, Red Mole, which Tariq Ali edited alongside an editorial board with an IMG majority. Red Mole was a \\"revolutionary internationalist\\" paper that carried a broad range of left-wing opinion in its pages, including a famous interview with John Lennon. Chenhanho Chimutengwende, a Zimbabwe exile who later served as a minister under Robert Mugabe, was one of the non-IMG members on the editorial board.Red Mole, Vol. 2, No. 6, 23 Mar‚Äì7 April 1971, p. 2, & Vol. 2, No. 8, 24 April‚Äì8 May 1971, p. 11, both give lists of the editorial board. IMG members also took part in New Left Review: Tariq Ali, Robin Blackburn, and Quintin Hoare were on its editorial board for much of the 1970s and subsequently. Because Red Mole was used by the IMG as its main organ, articles were sometimes mistakenly thought to indicate the positions of the IMG. For example, there was confusion after Robin Blackburn had written an April 1970 article entitled \\"Let it bleed\\" for Red Mole, in which he argued that Marxists should disrupt the campaigns of the Labour and Conservative parties in the 1970 General Election. IMG secretary Pat Jordan replied a month later to explain why the IMG favoured a Labour victory. The group's general orientation at that time was summarised by Ali's book The Coming British Revolution (). By September 1970, Red Circles had been set up to organise activists who supported the paper. Many went on to join the IMG. The IMG radicalised as it grew: Pat Jordan's leadership gave way to that of John Ross, who anticipated that the rising tide of class struggle could lead to a pre-revolutionary crisis in Britain. In August 1972, the IMG formally assumed control of the Red Mole and prepared to relaunch it as a weekly newspaper. The IMG strongly supported the IRA, adopting the slogan \\"Victory for the IRA\\" whilst refusing to criticise any of its terrorist activities. =Red Weekly= In May 1973, the fortnightly Red Mole was replaced by Red Weekly. International's editors and editorial board included many of the organisation's leaders, including Tariq Ali, Patrick Camiller, Ann Clafferty, Gus Fagan, Peter Gowan, Quintin Hoare, Michelle Lee, Bob Pennington, John Ross, Tony Whelan and Judith White. During the 1970s the organisation developed a number of fluid, competing factions and tendencies. The IMG's leadership included Alan Jones (John Ross), Brian Grogan, Bob Pennington, Brian Heron and others. A notable minority tendency included Pat Jordan, Tariq Ali, Phil Hearse and many of the IMG's supporters on the New Left Review editorial board. A smaller tendency supported the positions of the American Socialist Workers Party. Other tendencies included a small group that eventually left to join the Workers' Socialist League of Alan Thornett, and a Left Opposition Tendency, some of whose members left and formed a new group, the Revolutionary Marxist Current, which later joined Big Flame. The United Secretariat prepared theses on the situation in Britain and the tasks of the IMG in 1973, and again in 1976, to help orient the organisation. In 1974, its members started to publish South Asia Marxist Review. The IMG came to the public attention in 1974 during Lord Justice Scarman's Public Judicial Inquiry into the violent disturbances known as the Red Lion Square disorders, which led to the death of Kevin Gately, a University of Warwick student who was not an IMG member. Scarman found that the IMG had made a \\"vicious, violent and unprovoked attack on the Police\\" who were guarding Conway Hall to try and prevent access to the hall by the National Front who had booked it for a meeting to protest against the Labour Government's decision to grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants. According to a BBC documentary, the IMG was the only socialist group to play a role in the squatting movement.International Marxist Group (short BBC video). However, by the time of the 1976 USFI World Congress, internal disputes over Latin America were becoming more difficult to reconcile as divisions became entrenched between supporters of the International Majority Tendency, led by Ernest Mandel, and the Leninist Trotskyist Faction, which was led by the American Socialist Workers Party. Despite a 'truce' reflected by the establishment of Socialist Challenge, these divisions would result in the permanent splintering of the IMG's successor organisation, the Socialist League. This vigorous internal life did not impede its growth among students and workers. The IMG's growth was reflected when it established Red Books as its publishing house and bookshop. By 1977, when the leadership team around Tariq Ali had started the organisation on the road towards Socialist Challenge, both International and Socialist Woman were well- produced quarterly journals. During this period, the small Marxist Worker group also joined the IMG. =Socialist Challenge= In June 1977, Socialist Challenge replaced Red Weekly. It raised two slogans. * Build a socialist opposition. The IMG's new leadership team was inspired by the success in France of a united slate of three Trotskyist organisations (the LCR, LO and OCI). It started to campaign for united electoral action in Britain, partly to confront the growth of the National Front. The IMG launched the Socialist Unity initiative for the 1979 general election, which Big Flame also supported. Socialist Unity stood ten candidates; its highest vote was 477 votes, for Tariq Ali in Southall. * For a united revolutionary organisation. The IMG argued that the forces of the far left should unite in a single organisation. This partly reflected growing openness of the USFI to regroupment, but also addressed the growth of the far left. The IMG proposed unity to the International Socialists (who had unsuccessfully made a similar proposal to the IMG a decade earlier). The IS turned them down flat although the manner of the IMGs approach, which reportedly described the IS as a centrist grouping, may have some relation to this decision on the part of the IS leadership. Around this time IMG members also published several issues of a magazine called Black Liberation and Socialism.Register of the Library of Social History Collection, Hoover Institute, Stanford University. By 1979 the IMG grew to its highpoint of 758 members in good standing, and a total of 1,000 supporters. In 1980, Tony Benn's campaign led the IMG to increase its focus on the Labour Party. It developed a 'combination tactic' in which its fraction of members in the Labour Party was boosted. By 1981, the IMG- organised youth organisation called Revolution Youth, which organised its magazine Revolution, had entered the Labour Party Young Socialists in order to build it and win activists to the IMG's politics. The IMG was soon to send a second wave of members into the Labour Party, leading it to merge in 1982 with the League for Socialist Action, a small group of Fourth International supporters that had been engaged in entrism in the Labour party for at least five years. Initially, IMG members in the Labour Party continued to sell Socialist Challenge. They used it to argue that the Bennite left needed to organise together with the trade union left. IMG members, often describing themselves as 'Socialist Challenge supporters', supported the formation of Bennite organisations such as Labour Briefing and the Labour Committee on Ireland. In mid-1982 its central committee started to discuss whether to announce that the IMG was dissolved in order to better facilitate its entry. =Socialist Action= In December 1982, the IMG renamed itself the Socialist League, while continuing to refer to itself as the IMG in internal documents.Collection of International Marxist Group, British Library of Political and Economic Science (LSE Library). The group had fully entered the Labour Party and in 1983 began publishing the Socialist Action newspaper, by which name the League was often known. Despite initial successes, Socialist Action was established at a time when the Bennite movement had started to suffer defeats. In 1983, the group's membership fell to around 500. Different tendencies developed in the organisation over how to relate to the political evolution of figures like Ken Livingstone and Arthur Scargill. At the same time, the Socialist Workers Party in the US, which influenced many of the group's members, started to withdraw from the International. This opened up the most bitter internal political struggle in the group's history. Under the pressures of the defeat of the 1984‚Äì1985 miners strike, the group fragmented into three organisations. * The largest minority, Faction One, led by Phil Hearse, Dave Packer, Davy Jones, and Bob Pennington formed the International Group in 1985. They left after the two smaller minorities formed what they regarded as an unprincipled alliance that prevented them from taking over the leadership of the group. It merged with the Socialist Group in 1987, to form the International Socialist Group and publish Socialist Outlook. The ISG was recognised as the British Section of the Fourth International at its world congress in 1995, later merging into Socialist Resistance. * The remaining majority of the Socialist League consisted of two factions. The smaller faction was led by John Ross, and this dominated the apparatus of the organisation. Ross's current was generally supportive of Livingstone and Scargill. The evolution of this group is discussed under its own entry, Socialist Action (UK). It eventually stopped the production of Socialist Action and withdrew from the Fourth International. * The third current was a faction led by Brian Grogan and Jonathan Silberman which supported the American Socialist Workers Party. According to New International 11, it was expelled from the Socialist League in January 1988, one week before a conference at which its platform would have had the majority. Those expelled went ahead with the scheduled conference, which Ross's tendency had cancelled, and founded the Communist League, which is part of the Pathfinder tendency.

For part of its existence, it was also an international train.

His brother, Tatsunosuke Yamazaki was also a politician and cabinet minister, and his nephew Heihachiro Yamazaki was later a prominent member of the post-war Liberal-Democratic Party. Biography Yamazaki was born in ≈åkawa, Fukuoka. After his graduation in 1918 from the law school of Tokyo Imperial University, he entered the Home Ministry. He subsequently transferred to the Ministry of Health, rising to the post of Director of Social Services. In 1938, he was appointed governor of Shizuoka Prefecture. He subsequently returned to the Home Ministry, and was Director of Public Works, followed by Director of Public Safety. In 1940, succeeded Genki Abe as Superintendent- General of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, the highest-ranking office in the police administration. From 1942-1943, he served as Deputy Home Minister under the T≈çj≈ç administration, and also from 1944-1945 under the Suzuki Kantar≈ç administration. In mid-1944, he was assigned as civilian administrator of Japanese-occupied Borneo, where he encouraged a policy of Japanization of the local inhabitants through education to bolster support for Imperial Japan‚Äôs war efforts.Oi, The Japanese Occupation of Borneo, page 78 Following the surrender of Japan, Yamazaki was appointed Home Minister under the Higashikuni administration. During his tenure, he attempted to ban publication of a photograph Emperor Hirohito taken together with General Douglas MacArthur, on the grounds that this was demeaning to the imperial dignity. This action drew the wrath of the occupation authorities, who were attempting to portray Hirohito in more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù terms.Large, Emperor Hirohito and Showa Japan, page 137 He also strongly opposed the decision by the occupation authorities to release political prisoners held under the Peace Preservation Laws, stating in an interview with the Japan Times newspaper on 4 October 1945 that anyone advocating any changes in the present political structure, of the status of the Emperor was a communist who should be arrested.Nishi, Unconditional Democracy, page 91 He resigned together with the rest of the cabinet in protest of the repeal of the Peace Preservation Laws on 9 October 1945 and was immediately placed on the purged list of those banned from holding government office. Following the end of the occupation, Yamazaki was elected to a seat lower house of the Diet of Japan in the 1952 General Election under the Liberal Party. During the debate over the adoption of the post-war Constitution of Japan, he publicly speculated that it might be better for Japan to become a protectorate of the United States.Dore, Japan, Internationalism, and the UN, page 57 Yamazaki was associated with the politically conservative wing of the party after it became the Liberal Democratic Party and was a leading member of the faction led by Mitsujiro Ishii. He served as chairman of the budgetary committee in 1957. In 1960, he was appointed to the cabinet of Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda as Minister of Home Affairs. Yamazaki also served as Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission. He was forced to resign in the aftermath of the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, president of the Japan Socialist Party during a televised speech. Yamazaki retired thereafter from public life, and died in 1968 at the age of 73. References *Dore, R.P. Japan, Internationalism and the UN. Routledge. *Hunter, Janet.

El-Sharkawi is an innocent member of a family involved in illegal activities, who try to teach him to become like them. Through several failed attempts, he makes enemies who come after him. In an attempt to save him, his family sends him to China, to take the place of his father-in-law in an international cooking competition. Because El-Sharkawi had never been on an aeroplane before, he mistakenly gets sucked into the plane's toilet. To rescue him, he is taken off the plane still on the toilet, where a Chinese attendant named Lee laughs at his predicament. The two fall in love and marry despite El-Sharkawi's family's prejudices, which are resolved with Lee's Chinese philosophies.

He ran mainly at Newmarket and won fifteen of his twenty-one races, including the October Oatlands Stakes in 1800. After retiring from racing he became a successful stallion and was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland for three years. Amongst his progeny were Morel, Maid of Orleans, Wizard, Soothsayer, Sorcery, Trophonius, Comus and Smolensko. He was bred and owned by Sir Charles Bunbury and died in 1821. Background Sorcerer was a black colt bred by Sir Charles Bunbury and foaled in 1796. He grew to stand 16 hands 1 inch high. He was sired by Trumpator, who raced mainly at Newmarket and won the Claret Stakes in 1786. Trumpator also became a successful stallion and was British Champion sire in 1803. He also sired Epsom Derby winner Didelot and the broodmares Pawn and Penelope. Sorcerer was the first foal of Young Giantess, a daughter of Diomed, who also went on to produce Eleanor, Julia, Cressida and the Walton mare. Racing career=1799: Three-year-old season= Sorcerer made his debut at the Newmarket Second October meeting. He started a Sweepstakes of 200 guineas each for three-year-olds as the 2/1 favourite. In the two and a quarter mile race he finished second to Sir F. Standish's brother to Spread Eagle. Kite finished the race in third place and Rebel fourth. At the end of the month he beat Lord Clermont's Royala in a match race over five and a half furlongs at Newmarket. Symmetry (foreground) and Sorcerer at Newmarket =1800: Four-year-old season= On 28 April 1800 at Newmarket, Sorcerer lost a match race to Schedoni. Three days later he faced Chippenham in a match race over the Rowley Mile. Chippenham started as the 2/7 favourite, but Sorcerer won the 100 guineas race. In mid-May he beat Speculator in a one- mile race, again racing at Newmarket. Racing away from Newmarket for the first time, he won the King's Plate at Ipswich in July. The race was run in two two- mile heats, with Sorcerer winning both heats, beating a Pot-8-Os colt and Skyrocket. He returned to Newmarket for the July meeting, where he beat Cadet, Skyrocket and Gouty in the ¬£50 race over two miles. After a few months off he returned to the track in October, when he lost a match race against Symmetry at Newmarket. Later in the day he finished third behind winner Humbug in a 50 guineas race over the four-mile Beacon course. Two days later he finished as the runner-up to Worthy in the King's Plate, a race run over almost four miles. At Newmarket's Second October meeting he beat Surprise over two miles. He then contested the October Oatlands Stakes. Sorcerer started the one-mile race as the 11/5 favourite, with Georgiana at 4/1, Humbug at 5/1 and First Fruits at 7/1 also near the fore of the betting. Sorcerer won the race from Scrub, who finished second, with the other seven runners not being placed by the judge. =1801: Five-year-old season= Sorcerer returned to the track again in April 1801 at the Newmarket Craven meeting. He won a Subscription plate of ¬£50, beating three rivals after starting as the odds-on favourite. He them collected a 50 guinea forfeit from Richmond, whom he was due to race at the First Spring meeting. At the same meeting he beat Sir Harry and Ploughboy to win a ¬£50 Subscription, run over almost four miles. Two days later he faced Worthy and a Sir Peter colt in the King's Plate over three miles, six and a half furlongs. Worthy and Sorcerer finished in a dead heat and the race had to be decided in a run-off, which was won by Worthy. A further two days later, on the last day of the meeting, Sorcerer beat Richmond in a two-mile match race. The two horses met again in July, this time over four miles, with Sorcerer again coming out on top. The following day Sorcerer walked over for a ¬£50 race over the two-mile Ditch-in course. At Oxford he beat Cordovan in both of the two three-mile heats to win ¬£50 given by the Duke of Marlborough. On 29 July he walked over for King's Plate at Burford. His final race came on 15 August, when he beat Rebel for a Subscription of 10 guineas each over four miles at Lewes. He was then retired to stud. Stud career Sorcerer's son Smolensko Sorcerer stood as a stallion at Great Barton in Suffolk. In 1805 his stud fee was ten guineas and half a guinea for the groom. He was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1811, 1812 and 1813. His most notable progeny were: * Morel (1805) - won a number of races, including the Oaks Stakes in 1808. * Maid of Orleans (1806) - won the Oaks in 1809. * Wizard (1806) - won the 2000 Guineas and finished second in the 1809 Derby.

Introduced in 1960, it was operated by the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Chemins de fer fran√ßais (\\"French National Railway Corporation\\") (SNCF). It was also the SNCF‚Äôs first foray into high-speed commercial service above . The train was named after the Capitole de Toulouse, a mainly 18th century building in Toulouse that houses the H√¥tel de Ville, the Th√©√¢tre du Capitole (opera house), and the Donjon du Capitole (16th century). Route The route of Le Capitole was from Paris via the Paris‚ÄìBordeaux railway as far as Orl√©ans, and then via the Orl√©ans‚ÄìMontauban railway to Montauban, and the Bordeaux‚ÄìS√®te railway to Toulouse. The train had the following stops: * Paris-Austerlitz ‚Äì Limoges-B√©n√©dictins ‚Äì Brive-la-Gaillarde ‚Äì ‚Äì Montauban-Ville-Bourbon ‚Äì Toulouse-Matabiau History Le Capitole began its existence as an evening first-class-only Rapide (express train) between Paris-Gare d'Austerlitz and Toulouse-Matabiau, departing in the late afternoon in both directions. In 1967, it became the first European train to be scheduled to run at . In autumn 1968, a second train carrying the same name was added, operating in the morning in both directions on the route. In 1970, Le Capitole was integrated into the Trans Europ Express (TEE) system. The morning TEE departed from both Paris and Toulouse at 7:45 a.m. and operated daily except Sundays. The other departed in the late afternoon and ran seven days a week.Thomas Cook Continental Timetable (March 29‚ÄìApril 25, 1974 edition), pp. 69‚Äì70, 132‚Äì133. Peterborough, UK: Thomas Cook Publishing. Both trains were TEEs and both were normally called simply Le Capitole, although the morning train was sometimes referred to informally as \\"Le Capitole (du matin)\\" (the \\"morning Capitole\\"). Each train included a 48-seat restaurant car operated by the Wagon-Lits Company. TEE cars making up the first-class section of Le Capitole du Matin in 1988, pictured loading at Limoges In 1982, the southbound morning train and northbound evening train were downgraded to a two-class Rapide, while the northbound morning train and southbound evening train remained a first-class-only Trans Europ Express. All four trains were still called Le Capitole. Also, the remaining TEE service now operated only six days a week: daily except Saturdays northbound and daily except Sundays southbound.Thomas Cook Continental Timetable, various issues, 1982‚Äì84. Thomas Cook Publishing. In 1984, the remaining TEE trains on the route were downgraded to two-class Rapide. The two morning trains (74/75) became Le Capitole du Matin, and the two evening trains (76/77) became Le Capitole du Soir (the \\"evening Capitole\\"). Le Capitole was discontinued in 1991, one year after the introduction of through TGV service between Paris and Toulouse via Bordeaux, a portion of which followed a higher-speed line. The TGV route was longer, at 827 km compared with Le Capitole 713 km route (via Limoges), but had a travel time that was one hour shorter: 5 hours, 10‚Äì13 minutes (depending on direction), compared with 6 hours, 2‚Äì20 minutes, on the more direct route.Thomas Cook European Timetable (April 1991 edition), pp. 75, 119, 124.

Biography Yelena Sheremeteva was the daughter of the boyar Ivan Vasilyevich Sheremetev. She was selected to marry the son of the tsar in a Bride-show of daughters from the nobility. Before her marriage to the Tsarevich, his father had considered many women as a possible wife for his son, but had found most of them unsuitable for one reason or another. The young Ivan's first and second wives were both thrown into convents on account of their apparent inability to have children. In October 1581, Yelena was found to be pregnant. However, on 15 November, the Tsar accused her of supposedly wearing immodest clothing and he began to beat her. Hearing her screams, Yelena's husband hurried to her defense, shouting at his father, \\"You sent my first wife to a convent for no reason, you did the same with my second, and now you strike the third, causing the death of the son she holds in her womb.\\" Subsequently, Yelena did indeed suffer a miscarriage. The Tsarevich Ivan soon confronted his father on the matter, and a heated argument ensued and only ended when the Tsar struck his son on the head with his staff. The Tsarevich died of his wound on 19 November 1581, leaving Yelena a widow. After the death of her spouse, her father-in-law placed her in the Novodevichy Convent. However, unlike her two predecessors, she was not exiled far away from Moscow, but placed in a convent near the court, where she was treated in accordance to her status as a member of the imperial family.

Training Chaplains undergo training at Britannia Royal Naval College alongside other Royal Navy officer cadets. After completing the course they may opt to earn their \\"Dolphins\\" and serve in the Submarine Service or the green beret (upon completion of the All Arms Commando Course) and serve with the Royal Marines. Chaplains of the Fleet The role of Chaplain of the Fleet, being Head of the Naval Chaplains, was established on 13 May 1859, and was originally attached to the role of Senior Chaplain at Greenwich Hospital and was also the Inspector of Naval Schools.

The Science of Family: Working with Ancestral Patterns. O Books, ix. Purce is the author of The Mystic Spiral: Journey of the Soul, a book about the spiral in sacred traditions, art and psychology. She has also written numerous articles.Purce, J. (1974). The Mystic Spiral, London: Thames & Hudson. Background Purce was born in Staffordshire, England. Educated at Headington School, Oxford, she graduated with a BA in Fine Art from the University of Reading (1970) and Master's degrees from the Chelsea College of Art, London (1970‚Äì71), and King's College London. In a BBC documentary about her, More Ways than One: The Mystic Spiral, Purce described how, through contemplating the patterns in water, she noticed that when flow encounters resistance, first it rotates, then these rotary patterns become individual eddies which separate out as independent forms. This observation of the form-creating principle of flow, resistance, and rotation, became the basis of her research from 1968 until 1974, on the form of the spiral and the theme of the labyrinth in nature, science, art, psychology, and sacred traditions.Kurtz, M.

Purce was awarded a Leverhulme Research Fellowship at King's College London, Biophysics Department, to explore the spiral as a universal structure. Here, she initiated a dialogue between science and spirituality with Maurice Wilkins (Nobel laureate with Watson and Crick for the discovery of DNA), and lectured to the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science. Between 1974 and 1976, she lectured at the Architectural Association School of Architecture and Chelsea College of Art and Design and was a visiting lecturer at numerous universities and art schools, on art and sacred traditions; form and the spiral; and the tradition of music, sound, and the voice as a contemplative practice in diverse cultures. Her work with the voice was a major impetus behind widespread research into the supposed healing effects of sound from the 1970s onwards.The International Sound Healing Conference, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, 2008.Shapiro, E. & Shapiro, D. (1998). 'Voices from the Heart: Inspiration for a Compassionate Future', Random House. pp. 196‚Äì202.Metzner, R. (Ed.). Re-Vision, Journal of Consciousness and Change, Special Issue: The Resonating Universe, vol.10, No.1, Summer 1987... Cymatics Purce investigated the effect of sound on matter in the late 1960s, following the work of Hans Jenny, who used fine powders, liquids, and pastes, to show how formless matter takes on diverse forms and complex patterns through sound vibration. Purce also investigated the effect of sound vibrations on fine particles and on water, inspired by the early experiments of Ernst Chladni in 1785 and Margaret Watts Hughes between 1885 and 1904...Griggs, B. (Dec 1992). Soul Music: Striking a healthy note. Country Living. Purce and Stockhausen Between June 1971 and 1974, Purce lived in K√ºrten, Germany, and worked with the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen.Interview with Karlheinz Stockhausen, Sound International Magazine, Oct. 1978. Stockhausen had just introduced a simple form of overtone chanting using vowels to the West for the first time with the premiere of Stimmung in December 1968. During the autumn of 1971, Purce toured with Stockhausen and the performances of Stimmung throughout the eastern United States and Canada. She provided him with many ideas about sounds and their effects on matter, which he used to create Alphabet f√ºr Li√®ge, a piece demonstrating those effects (1972). Purce took part in performances of Stockhausen's music at various music festivals (Li√®ge, Rencontres Internationales d'Art Contemporain‚ÄîLa Rochelle, and Sainte-Baume‚Äî1972, 1973, 1974).Stockhausen, K. (1978). DuMont, p. 200-1. Working with the voice Researching the supposed beneficial properties of the voice since 1968 and having spent time with the Gyut√∂ monks before going to Germany in 1971, Purce later continued her studies in the Himalayas with the chantmaster of the Gyut√∂ Tibetan Monastery, Tenpa Gyaltsen, and with the Mongolian Kh√∂√∂mii master, Yavgaan, in order to explore the Tibetan and Mongolian methods of overtone chanting. Purce's research, lectures, and workshops, have attempted to demonstrate how the human voice might be used to bring about positive psychological, emotional, and physical changes through acting as a link between body and mind, as described in Buddhist and other Eastern traditions.Polly Samson. \\"Getting Those Good Vibrations\\".

Purce has also been invited by several hospitals and schools to explore how these voice techniques might be of positive help to women in childbirth; at the Maudsley Hospital in London, with people suffering from Alzheimer's; at the Royal Free Hospital, London, with people suffering from mental disabilities; at Hawthorn School, with children suffering from physical disabilities; and with people suffering from Chronic fatigue syndrome.Lind-Kyle, P.

In June 1993, Purce gave a lecture and seminar for the English National Opera titled The Healing Power of Opera, as part of the Covent Garden Music Festival, London. She later led the audience in a chanting meditation before the first performance of Jonathan Harvey's opera Inquest of Love for ENO. In 2003, she was invited to work with nuns and monks in a number of enclosed Christian monastic communities who sing Gregorian chant, particularly Burnham Abbey and Fairacres, Oxford, to teach overtone chanting and other methods to explore ways of reinvigorating and rediscovering the contemplative aspects of chant in Christian traditions.van Tongeren, M.C. (2006). Overtone Singing. Centraal Boekhuis. pp. 209‚Äì10 and p. 229. Family Constellations In 1999, as part of the international conference on Family Constellations, and the work of family therapist Bert Hellinger in Wiesloch, Germany, Purce was invited to give an extended workshop to demonstrate her work to Hellinger's students and conference delegates. Influenced by her time in Japan in the early 1980s, where there is a strong tradition of honouring ancestors, Purce developed a process for doing this in her own work, using ceremony and chant to acknowledge excluded family members, both living and dead.

He embarked on a political career, and was a Member of Parliament for the Parliaments of Ireland and Great Britain. Stewart was born into the nobility, raised the younger son of a viscount. He entered the navy at an early age, but suffered a severe wound at the beginning of his career, losing his right hand. He recovered, and prospered in the service, rising to command several ships in the frequent wars of the early eighteenth century. He also had an interest in politics, representing Tyrone from 1715. By 1720 he had risen high enough in the navy to be entrusted with a squadron to take action against Mediterranean piracy, particularly the dangerous Sal√© Rovers. He had the dual commission of acting as minister plenipotentiary to Morocco, and managed to successfully negotiate a treaty and the release of 296 British prisoners. Rewarded with an increased pension and further commands, Stewart was raised to flag rank and served for a time as commander in chief in the West Indies, and held junior commands in the Channel Fleet. He also sat for the British parliament, representing Malmesbury from 1723 until 1727, and Portsmouth from 1737 until his death in 1741. Family and early career Charles Stewart was born in 1681, the fifth son of Sir William Stewart later 1st Viscount Mountjoy. His mother was Mary, the eldest daughter of Richard Coote, 1st Baron Coote. Charles entered the navy at an early age, and was involved in the Nine Years' War. In 1697, at the age of 16, his ship was involved in an engagement with a French warship off Dover, and Stewart was injured, losing his right hand. He was granted a pension of ¬£100 for his injury in 1699. Recovering from the injury, he continued in the service and was promoted to lieutenant. He served on several ships at this rank until being promoted to captain and given command of the frigate on 1 December 1704. After some time in command of this ship, he was transferred to the 50-gun and served in the Mediterranean under Sir John Leake. He was one of the officers involved in the court-martial of Sir Thomas Hardy in October 1707, aboard at Portsmouth. Parliament and commands Stewart combined a naval career with a political one, at first entering the Parliament of Ireland in October 1715, representing Tyrone. After some years in the navy, he was assigned to command a squadron in the Mediterranean in 1720 against the Sal√© Rovers. Combined with this task was the appointment as minister plenipotentiary to Morocco, with orders to secure a peace treaty with the emperor, Ismail Ibn Sharif. =Embassy to Morocco= Stewart sailed from England on 24 September, making his way to T√©touan via Gibraltar. Arriving at T√©touan on 22 December, he negotiated a treaty with the pasha and the articles were exchanged on 17 January 1721. He then travelled on to Mequinez, arriving on 3 July 1721 and meeting the emperor in an audience on 6 July. The articles of the treaty were exchanged, with Abdelkader Perez, a Moroccan admiral and later ambassador to Britain, assisting negotiations. The emperor then presented Stewart with a gift of nine Christian slaves. A second meeting took place on 23 July, at which all the captured Englishmen held as slaves, 296 in total, were released. After exchanging messages of friendship and goodwill, Stewart left Mequinez on 27 July and arrived back at T√©touan on 12 August. He then returned to Britain with the former captives. His success on these occasions was rewarded with the increase of his annual pension to ¬£300, on 14 December 1724. =Politics and flag rank= Stewart apparently became a supporter of John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, and was elected to represent Malmesbury on his interest, on 25 January 1723. He represented Malmesbury until 1727, and though Sir Charles Wager expected that Argyll would arrange for Stewart to be elected to represent Portsmouth in 1732, this did not happen. Stewart's next opportunity to distinguish himself at sea came in late 1729, towards the end of the Anglo-Spanish War. News arrived in England that Edward St. Lo, commander in chief at the Jamaica Station during the Blockade of Porto Bello, had died while in command. Stewart was promoted to rear-admiral of the blue on 9 December 1729 and set out to take up the command in Lo's stead,Cundall, p. xx flying his flag aboard . He was commander in chief until 1732, being promoted to rear-admiral of the white on 29 June 1732. He was promoted again, to vice-admiral of the blue, on 26 February 1734, and given command of a division of a fleet being prepared for sea to counter Spanish threats. Stewart duly hoisted his flag aboard the 80-gun , but the crisis passed without breaking into war. He then became second in command of the Channel Fleet, under Sir John Norris, flying his flag aboard the 70-gun , but again without seeing any action. Later life Stewart continued to serve in the navy and receive promotions. He was raised to the rank of vice-admiral of the white on 2 March 1736. He also resumed his parliamentary career, being returned to represent Portsmouth at a by-election on 10 February 1737. He held this seat until his death on 5 February 1741, voting against the Convention of Pardo in 1739, but for the place bill of 1740. He died unmarried. Notes a. In the summer of 1706 Hardy had been given command of a small squadron assigned to escort a convoy of 200 merchants to Lisbon.

The Guardian, 12 November 1959, p. 6 Early in her career she attracted the attention of James Barrie. She toured as Lady Babbie in his romance The Little Minister, playing the part more than 700 times. She returned to London and appeared in two conspicuous successes, A Chinese Honeymoon (taking over from Louie Freear as Fi Fi) and 'Op o' Me Thumb, as Amanda. In 1904 she resumed her association with Barrie, touring in his Little Mary. He was working on the stage version of Peter Pan at the time, and he cast her as Wendy to the Peter of Nina Boucicault. Over the years she played the part nearly a thousand times. In Barrie's Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire (1905) she had a supporting role in the London cast, in which the main female roles were taken by Ellen Terry and Irene Vanbrugh as mother and daughter. When the piece toured, Terry remained and Trevelyan succeeded to Vanbrugh's part. She followed this comic role with \\"an exquisite performance as the hapless, terror-stricken orphan\\" in Herbert Beerbohm Tree's production of Oliver Twist. =West End success= After playing Tweeny in a revival of Barrie's The Admirable Crichton in 1908, Trevelyan was given her biggest chance so far, as Maggie in What Every Woman Knows, a part Barrie wrote with her in mind.

In 1916 she had another Barrie hit with A Kiss for Cinderella. =Post-war and later years= In 1924 Trevelyan appeared in a new production of Arnold Bennett's The Great Adventure. The Observer's critic wrote, \\"When I say that Miss Hilda Trevelyan's Janet Cannot seemed to me quite perfect there will doubtless be people to tell me that the part has been done better.

There is very little safe water and population remains under 1000 with roughly 100 households.http://watsanportal.org/sn/access/locality?id=07234065&details;=&tab;=comments#comments References Geography of Senegal ","title":"Ndoucoumane"},{"id":"38615326","text":"The Burroughs AN/FST-2 Coordinate Data Transmitting Set (CDTS) was a Cold War military computer system at SAGE radar stations for displaying aircraft tracks and converting them for digital transmission to IBM AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Centrals at air defense data centers.

Diagnosis A urinoma is the result of a breach of the integrity of the pelvis or calices of the kidney or of the ureter. The urine collection in the perirenal fat causes an inflammatory response with lipolysis resulting in its fibrous encapsulation. Urinomas are usually caused by blunt trauma to the kidneys. While extravasation of urine is common as a result a severe blunt trauma (2-18%), spontaneous resolution is typical, and urinoma formation develops only in few instances. Less common causes of urinoma development are ureteral obstructions due to cancer, calculus formation, pregnancy, or congenital causes. Urinomas tend to develop gradually. Symptoms depend on size and location of the lesion. Eventually local pain and pressure symptoms may become apparent. Biochemical testing of renal function is indicated. Imaging (IVP, ultrasonography, CT scan) will identify the lesion. Image-guided percutaneous needle aspiration is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Management If left untreated, complications may arise including abscess formation, peritonitis, sepsis, and damage to the urinary tract by fibrosis and granuloma formation. It is recommended, as a first step, to drain the lesion with ultrasound or CT guidance. If a patient has an underlying obstructive problem it needs to be addressed according to its cause.

The book is written from the perspective of a Senegalese woman living in diaspora, named Ken Bugul, and the book is largely biographical. However, while the novel does reflect true events, it is not a completely authentic re- telling of those event. Bugul uses her own experiences to shape the narrative, but the story is not a chronological re-telling of the events. The book is crafted in a way that the reader can understand a clear narrative and understand the effects of post-colonialism on a young Senegalese woman living in diaspora.

Both versions trace the king's life from his purported ancestry from King Sithu II of Pagan Dynasty down to his death from an illness from his campaign against Siam in 1760. Both contains many details, though not all the same, of the king's 8-year reign.Thaw Kaung 2010: 32 Names The first published version in 1883 was named Alaungpaya Ayedawbon but subsequent editions of the chronicle were titled Alaungpaya Ayedawbon or Alaung Mintayagyi Ayedawbon. Confusion arose when the second version was published for the first time in 1961, together with the first version. They both were published under the name Alaung Mintayagyi Ayedawbon.Thaw Kaung 2010: 23‚Äì25 Authorship Scholarship agrees that both chronicles are contemporary accounts of the king by his ministers but does not agree on the authorship. Both versions were kept at the Royal Library of the last two Konbaung kings, Mindon and Thibaw. According to U Yan, the Royal Librarian, one version is by Letwe Nawrahta and the other is by Twinthin Taikwun Maha Sithu. One of the versions was published in 1883, and again in 1900 as Alaungpaya Ayedawbon. The first two publications did not explicitly state the author's name, leaving it as \\"a wise man from the time of Alaungpaya\\". When it was published again together with other chronicles in 1923, the authorship was attributed to Twinthin Taikwun Maha Sithu.

However, more recent scholars Hla Thamein (the editor of the 1961 publication of both versions),Hla Thamein 1961: 6‚Äì11 Yi Yi and Kyauk Taing all say the 1883 version was written by Twinthin Taikwun, while Thaw Kaung sides with earlier historians, and says it was Letwe Nawrahta.

Although she made an appearance in the New York folk music scene of the 1930s, she was overshadowed by her older brother and half-sister. Rediscovered in the 1960s while living in Detroit, she played at folk festivals at Newport in 1964 and the University of Chicago in 1965. Early life and family She was born Sarah Elizabeth Garland on June 28, 1910, on Elys Branch, Knox County, Kentucky. Her father was coal miner Oliver Perry Garland and her mother Sarah Elizabeth Lucas Garland, his second wife. He had earlier married Deborah Robinson Garland who bore four children, including Mary Magdalene Garland, later better known as Aunt Molly Jackson. After Deborah's death, Oliver married Sarah Lucas, and had eleven more children, including Jim Garland and Sarah Ogan Gunning. The children grew up with little formal education but with strong family ties and a rich tradition of songs and stories. In 1925 the fifteen-year-old Sarah fell in love with Andrew Ogan, a twenty-year-old from Claiborne County, Tennessee, who had come to work in the Fox Ridge coal mine in Bell County, Kentucky. They eloped to Cumberland Gap to marry. They had four children, two of whom died during the Depression. Living conditions were bad in eastern Kentucky by 1931, and many miners responded to the retreat of the United Mine Workers by joining the communist-led National Miners Union (NMU). The ensuing violence and controversy led many NMU leaders to leave the state. By 1935 the Garlands and the Ogans had moved to New York City, with assistance from New York University folklorist Mary Elizabeth Barnicle. In New York, they met many leaders of the folksong revival, including Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Burl Ives, Huddie Ledbetter, and Earl Robinson. But Andrew Ogan had TB, and when the illness worsened he moved back to Brush Creek in Knox County, Kentucky, where he died in August 1938. Sarah married Joseph Gunning, a skilled metal polisher, in August 1941. After the start of World War II they moved to work in the shipyard in Vancouver, Washington, where her brother Jim Garland had also found work. After the war they moved to Detroit, Michigan.\\"Archie Green on Sarah Ogan Gunning\\" Music career Through contacts she made while living in New York, Sarah Ogan had a dozen of her songs recorded by Alan Lomax in 1937, and Professor Barnicle recorded Sarah singing duets with her brother Jim Garland in 1938 for the Library of Congress. Woody Guthrie wrote a profile of Sarah for the New York Daily Worker in 1940, and expanded his sketch for his American Folksong.Moe Ashe: Disc Company, 1947; rpt. Oak Publications, 1963. She was also mentioned in the popular A Treasury of American Song.Olin Downes and Elie Siegmeister, editors, 1940. One of the well-known songs she wrote around 1936, \\"I am a Girl of Constant Sorrow,\\" appeared in a 1953 collection,John Greenway, American Folksongs of Protest, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953, pp.168-169. and was recorded in the 1960s by Peggy Seeger and Barbara Dane among others. The song is a rewrite of \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" that she remembered from a hillbilly record (likely recorded by Emry Arthur in 1928) she had heard some years before in the mountains, but the lyrics she wrote was considerably different from the original after the first verse. Living in Detroit, Sarah was overlooked in the early stages of the American folk revival in the 1950s. In August 1963 folklorist Archie Green visited Sarah in Detroit to follow up interviews he had done with her half-sister Aunt Molly Jackson. Green joined forces with Wayne State University faculty Ellen Stekert and Oscar Paskal to record Sarah in January and March 1964 in the studios of WDET and the United Auto Workers Solidarity House. The Detroit sessions provided the selections for her album \\"Girl of Constant Sorrow,\\" Folk-Legacy FSA-26, issued in 1965.For his later reflections on Sarah, see Archie Green, \\"A Folklorist's Creed and Folksinger's Gift,\\" in his Torching the Fink Books and Other Essays on Vernacular Culture, Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2001. She was encouraged to sing publicly in Professor Stekert's classes and at a conference featuring Walter Reuther and Michael Harrington in Detroit in 1964. She sang at the Newport Folk Festival in the summer of 1964, and had her most extended performance at the University of Chicago Folk Festival in January 1965.\\"Archie Green on Sarah Ogan Gunning\\" Sarah Gunning died during a family gathering in Knoxville, Tennessee on November 14, 1983 and was buried in Hart, Michigan, where she had lived since the mid-1960s.Judi Jennings, \\"Gunning, Sarah (Garland) Ogan,\\" in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, ed.

The name Mogg was invented to sound like \\"cool 1970s bands with long hair and flashy moustaches\\", a la Mud or Mott the Hoople. They split up in 1995. Biography The core members were Thomas Carfors, Janne Eklund, and Mats Attaque. Thomas Broman left Mogg and joined the Swedish bands Great King Rat and the Electric Boys. Several other members were part of the different incarnations of Mogg between 1981-1995, including Yngwie Malmsteen drummer Bo Werner, Gotham City members drummer Jonas √ñstman and bassist Bj√∂rn Melander and Nocturnal Rites frontman, Jonny Lindqvist, who came from the band Arrows. Mogg moved first to Stockholm in 1985 and then to Los Angeles in 1991, and released two albums and several singles during their career. They recorded their first album From the Ice Fields at Grandmaster Recorders Studios, in Hollywood, and also released a self-titled album, with more grunge rock influence before splitting up in 1995. Mogg were somewhat successful in Sweden, toured a lot with among others Treat and Europe (band), played before an audience of 14 000 at an outdoor show in Kungstr√§dg√•rden, Stockholm. Mogg were interviewed on the leading hard rock radio show in Sweden Rockbox in 1986 and there are still cover bands in Sweden performing some of their songs. During their time in Los Angeles, Mogg played shows at Coconut Teaszer, and Fm Station in North Hollywood, California. Their gig at the Fm Station was in January 1995. They opened for Killing Machine (band) and Tracii Guns at the Fm Station, in 1993. They also recorded soundtracks for \\"adult movies\\" including one 1992 TV movie starring Shannon Tweed, wife of Gene Simmons from Kiss, until they finally went their separate ways back in Sweden 1995. Thomas Carfors and Janne Eklund started a brand new band called Brassmonkey in 1998, also featuring John Norum bassplayer Anders \\"Nippe\\" Festader and released three albums that were met with positive reviews. Jonas √ñstman and Mats Attaque are currently members of the band Beautiful Grey who released the album Fine Forever in 2007. √ñstman also played in grunge band Mental Hippie Blood with Anders Wikstr√∂m of Treat (band)http://www.metal- archives.com/bands/Mental_Hippie_Blood/5576 and is now an established mixer/producer with among others Britney Spears 2004 hit single Toxic (song) on his resume.

Career He graduated in mathematics and physics at the University of Modena in the academic year 1952/54 with a thesis relating to the heat equation. In 1956, he became an assistant to Enrico Magenes, with whom he worked on a problem of Picone relating to the equilibrium state of an elastic body, and on other differential equations related to electrostatics. In 1964, he moved to the University of Pisa at the invitation of Alessandro Faedo, joining a group of mathematicians which included Aldo Andreotti, Jacopo Barsotti, Enrico Bombieri, Gianfranco Capriz, Ennio De Giorgi, Giovanni Prodi, Edoardo Vesentini, and Guido Stampacchia, with whom Campanato collaborated fruitfully. From 1975 until 2000 he taught Nonlinear Analysis at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. He died in Pisa on 1 March 2005. Honors *In 1985, the Accademia dei Lincei awarded him the \\"Premio Linceo\\" prize for his work on the regularity of nonlinear problems as relating to his eponymous Morrey‚ÄìCampanato spaces. *In 2000, a conference was held in honor of his 70th birthday at SNS Pisa. *In 2006, there was a conference held to commemorate his work at Erice, Sicily.

In the 2012 rankings of U.S. News & World Report Best High Schools, it ranked as number 45 within Massachusetts. The school serves grades 6‚Äì12 with a student to teacher ratio of 12:1. New construction=Planning stage= Based on a feasibility study performed in 2007 by Berlin-Boylston Regional School District, a recommendation for new construction of Tahanto Regional Middle/High School versus renovation was accepted by the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) as the more cost-effective option. It was additionally determined by affirmative town vote to move the 6th grade students from the two district elementary schools to the new building to create a \\"school within a school\\" approach. =Breaking ground= The groundbreaking ceremony took place in May 2011 for the new two-story, 126,100 square-foot facility. The new building is designed to serve 560 students from grades 6 through 12. A proposed U-shaped design was planned, with the two wings housing the middle and high schools, and the central core accommodating the auditorium, gymnasium, and cafeteria. =New school opens= The newly constructed $32.2M building opened its doors to students in grades 6 through 12 on January 3, 2013. The sixth-grade classes made the move from their respective elementary schools the following September. One major focus of the new building was to integrate new technology, such as SMART Boards (whiteboards that can be manipulated digitally), common spaces for students to meet in as groups, and the ability to provide a middle school experience within a larger school setting.

The film was directed by Rana Basu and produced under the banner of 3 eDots Productions. The film's music was composed by Sidhu. The film was released on 8 February 2013. The film is based on the story Trata, written by Dibyendu Palit. Plot The film revolves around a typical middle-class family of Bengal. Ananda (Rajatava Dutta) is a very meek guy and is scared of confronting people. He is a peace-loving man and very shy in nature. He works as a clerk in a government office. His wife Seema (Roopa Ganguly) is however a spirited woman and remains tense about him and her family. They have a college-going daughter Dolon (Sanchita) and a son, Suman who studies in Class 9 and stays in the school hostel. To get rid of their daily ordeal, Ananda asks for help from a small-time goon Tota a.k.a. Ganesh Halder (Saswata Chatterjee). Tota is the leader of the club in their locality. The club members call themselves as 'saviors' but are engaged in anti-social activities. Ananda is scared of the rowdy members of the club, so he decided to satisfy them by paying a very high amount of money for the Saraswati Puja celebration. In return, Tota promised Ananda to help him if he ever gets into trouble. But Tota gives evidence of his dishonest intentions by coming inside Ananda's house in his absence on the pretext of asking for a glass of water. After that, Seema no longer wanted to live in the locality. Meanwhile, Dolon needed a tutor and Sudeb (Bhaswar Chattopadhyay) is the chosen for the job, who later developed intimate relationships with her and eventually went through a physical relationship caught by Seema. Enraged Ananda asks Tota to stop Sudeb from visiting his daughter. In return Tota wants to meet Dolon privately in the club. Sensing something may go wrong, Seema insists Ananda to take Dolon to her grandmother's house for a few days in spite of Ananda being afraid of Tota's wrath. That night Tota attacks the family and in order to protect Ananda his wife Seema seduces Tota and Tota being invoked rapes her in the house as Ananda stays outside and repents for the incident. Theme The story is about ordinary people who mess up their lives in the urban culture. A story about all of them around the world ‚Äî across geographical frontiers, regardless of caste, creed and religion. The story is a portrayal of the rat like existence of the middle class. The middle class survives in an atmosphere of fear ‚Äî both known and unknown. They are most vociferous at meetings and rallies ‚Äì but they can be silent too. This dilemma engulfs their whole life and the onward road is unsure, beset with ifs and buts. Cast * Rajatava Dutta as Ananda * Roopa Ganguly as Seema * Saswata Chatterjee as Tota a.k.a.

Written by Jerry Wald, Maurice Leo, and Richard Macaulay, and directed by Ray Enright, the film is about a spoiled young heiress who tries to charge some gasoline at an auto court and is forced by the attendant to work out her bill by making beds and cleaning rooms. Resolving to get even, she pretends to have forgiven him, and then sends him to her father to get financing for his plan to develop a string of auto courts across the country, knowing he will only be wasting his time. Hard to Get was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on November 5, 1938. Plot The hectoring wife (Isabel Jeans) of New York oil magnate Ben Richards (Charles Winninger) is gathering her family for their annual summer vacation in Newport. Their spoiled willful and beautiful daughter Margaret (Olivia de Havilland) refuses to go and storms out of the house. Impetuously commandeering a modest car belonging to her father's valet, she soon notices the car is low on fuel and stops at an auto court gas station. The attendant, Bill Davis (Dick Powell), fills its tank and requests the $3.50 payment. With no money on her, Margaret tries to charge the amount to her father's account, but, doubting her identity, Bill matter of factly refuses. Instead, he offers to let her work off her debt by serving for the day as a housekeeper cleaning the auto court‚Äôs bungalows. Outraged by this suggestion, Margaret attempts to drive off, but backs into a truck preventing her from leaving. When a police officer arrives, Margaret is forced to comply with Bill's offer and spends the next few hours making beds and cleaning rooms. Margaret returns home vowing revenge on Bill for his treatment. At first she asks her father‚Äîwho is on the board of the oil company that owns the station‚Äîto have Bill fired. After listening to her story, however, her father agrees with the way Bill handled things and tells her she'll have to find her own way of getting even. The next day, Margaret returns to the gas station and apologizes to Bill, pretending instead to be the wealthy family's maid, \\"Maggie\\". Impressed by her change in demeanor, and attracted again by her obvious charms, Bill asks her on a date and she accepts. That night, Bill sneaks them into a banquet for a free dinner, then takes her up the Empire State Building, where he tells her about his dream of building a string of upscale auto courts across the country. Margaret tells him she thinks it's a great idea and sends him to her father to get financing for his plan‚Äîeven providing him her father's old oilfield nickname \\"Spouter\\" so the secretaries will think he is one of Ben's old friends. Margaret knows that when her father learns that Bill used the nickname to pretend he was an old friend, he will make his life miserable. As Margaret planned, Bill is given the runaround by Ben, who sends him off for even more by promising the support of his venture capitalist friend and business associate Atwater‚Äîneither of whom know that Margaret is behind the whole thing. When Ben discovers that his daughter planned the revenge pretending to be his maid, he invites Bill over to dinner for some fun at their expense. Maggie turns the tables by inducing the real maid to masquerade as Ben's daughter. Still believing that Ben wants to help him, Bill shortly after sneaks into a party given by Atwater, where he finally discovers that Margaret, Ben, and Atwater have been making a fool of him. After telling them all off, Bill storms out of the party, not knowing that Margaret has fallen in love with him. Hoping to square things, she goes to the auto court but learns that as a result of all the time he has spent away from his job Bill has been fired from his position and dropped out of sight. Realizing that Bill's national auto court plan has great potential, Ben and Atwater fight over who will finance the project. They converge on the high-rise construction site where Bill is now working and agree to be partners and pay Bill a substantial fee to serve as their architect. Bill accepts the offer. Sometime after, seeking forgiveness for what she's done, Margaret visits the original auto court, which is being transformed into his new vision. Playing Cupid, Ben soon arrives with a judge who is prepared to marry them. Ben's wife appears and tries to prevent the wedding, but Bill rebuffs her and professes his desire to marry Margaret. The movie ends with the newly wed couple pulling down the shade on one of the auto court bungalows to begin their honeymoon post haste. Powell, still deep in his crooner era, sings four tunes. Comic relief is provided by the running gag of Ben being bested in a wide variety of one-on- one sports competitions with Case, his valet, and some exaggerated flower fanciers at the banquet Bill and Maggie crash for a free meal.

Her inquiries into the work and conduct of Mark Geier and his son David Geier regarding chelation therapy and a hormone-altering drug called Lupron, led to medical board actions in multiple states that suspended Mark Geier from medical practice, and caused David Geier to be arraigned for allegedly practising medicine without a license. Early life The oldest of seven children, Seidel grew up in Anaheim, California, the daughter of a chemical engineer father and a mother who taught severely disabled children. She attended the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she majored in English and Russian literature and book arts, and then attended Columbia University to receive a masters' degree in library science. Pre-blogging career Seidel then worked at a children's library in Asheville for three years before she returned to New York City, where she met Dave, whom she would later marry. She then worked for a few years at Orbis International and the Taconic Foundation before moving with her husband to New Hampshire in 1995 to raise their family. One of their children was diagnosed with autism in 2000. Blogging She is known for running the website Neurodiversity.com, whose goal has been described as \\"honoring the variety of human wiring.\\" She is known for criticizing those who argue that vaccines cause autism. For instance, in 2007, with regard to claims of a mercury-autism link, she said, \\"Some people say, 'My child is a toxic waste dump,' People don't understand the stigma. I don't want someone looking at my family member that way.\\" One of Seidel's most influential submissions was to the editors of the journal Autoimmunity Reviews, after the Geiers published a paper in that journal. She received no response, but the paper was subsequently retracted. She has been called \\"the Erin Brockovich of autism spectrum disorders,\\" (specifically, by Irving Gottesman) and has been called \\"vicious\\" by the Geiers themselves.Kathleen Seidel and her enemies She and her husband, Dave, have two children, one of whom is on the autism spectrum. She has also criticized Boyd Haley for marketing OSR#1 as a dietary supplement (it has since been pulled from the shelves). =Subpoena= Seidel was the subject of a subpoena from Clifford Shoemaker, a vaccine-injury lawyer, requiring her to be deposed and to produce documents production in a case in which she was not involved, Sykes v. Bayer, and was defended by Public Citizen.Kathleen Seidel is Not Alone The subpoena seems to have been motivated by a post on her blog, neurodiversity.com, about the lawsuit. As David Ardia at PBS's Idea Lab blog put it: \\"Seidel's post mainly focused on developments in the lawsuit, but some of her language was critical of the Sykes and their case. For example, she indicated that the Sykes have \\"aggressively promoted the overwhelmingly discredited scientific hypothesis that autism is a consequence of mercury poisoning\\" and called their lawsuit \\"a hydra-headed quest for revenge, for compensation, and for judicial validation of autism causation theories roundly rejected by the greater scientific community, by numerous courts, and by a great number of individuals and families whose interests they purport to represent.\\"Blogger Kathleen Seidel Fights Subpoena Seeking Information About Vaccine Litigation One of the other criticisms revolved around her husband, a Wikipedia editor, making edits to Geier's Wikipedia page.Welcome to my Conspiracy David Gorski wrote on his blog, Respectful Insolence, \\"Reading the subpoena makes it mind-numbingly obvious that Shoemaker hopes to turn up evidence that Kathleen has accepted support from the federal government or vaccine manufacturers, which, I‚Äôm guessing, he hopes to use to slime her and destroy her credibility. There‚Äôs nothing there, but Shoemaker thinks there is, and that‚Äôs enough.\\"More legal thuggery She described the subpoena as \\"very broad\\" and filed a motion to quash. Shoemaker was sanctioned as a result.Sanctioned Her role in exposing the Geiers' quackery is explained by Seth Mnookin as follows: \\"The Geiers‚Äô use of Lupron on autistic children first received widespread attention in 2006, when Kathleen Seidel put together a blockbuster 16-part series on her website, neurodiversity.com.\\"Lessons from the shaming of chemically castrating doc who \\"endangers autistic children and exploits their parents\\" She is mentioned in an article in New York by Andrew Solomon, which also discusses the subpoena, which it says was served on March 26, 2008.The Autism Rights Movement Encryption survey In 2016, along with Bruce Schneier and Saranya Vijayakumar, Seidel co-authored a survey regarding the effectiveness of restrictions on the exports of encryption products from the United States on their availability in other countries, as well as laws requiring encryption software to be made with a backdoor that the government can access. In their survey, the authors stated that such bans still leave those who want to keep the government from accessing their data through a backdoor with many foreign alternatives to American or British software.

The anthology features material from Cockney Rebel, Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel and Harley's solo career. It covers all of Harley's albums, spanning over 33 years, from 1973's The Human Menagerie to 2005's The Quality of Mercy. The anthology was released by EMI Music UK. It was released on CD in the UK only. Today, the physical CD release is out-of-print. The anthology was compiled by project manager Nigel Reeve and designed by Chris Peyton. The album's sleeve notes were written by Geoff Barton of Classic Rock magazine. Barton is a long-term fan of Harley. The final track on Disc 3, the live song \\"Only You\\", is highlighted as being previously unreleased, although it had originally appeared on the 1999 live album Stripped to the Bare Bones. A studio version of \\"Only You\\" was later recorded for Harley's sixth solo album Uncovered (2020). Following its release, Harley spoke of the anthology in an October 2006 diary entry for his official website: \\"The Anthology is selling here in bucket-loads. I can't deny I'm proud of it.

Later favourites such as \\"Judy Teen\\" and \\"Mr Soft\\" were exquisitely crafted and arranged, and determinedly eccentric to boot. Intelligence has always been key to Harley's songwriting, which is why \\"Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)\\" still sounds fresh and innovative. Harley subsequently moved the band into more experimental areas for the albums Timeless Flight and Love's a Prima Donna. The American flavours and gospelly flourishes of Hobo with a Grin reflect Harley's residence in Los Angeles. He returned to music in the 90s, memorably with the slow-burning \\"All in a Life's Work\\" and \\"The Last Time I Saw You\\" from Poetic Justice. The Quality of Mercy, his most recent offering from 2005, explored extremely personal emotions, producing arguably Harley's most affecting collection to date.\\" Jake Jakeman of BBC Nottingham commented: \\"A three CD set might seem over the top for an artist we fondly remember for singing \\"Make Me Smile\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and who now happily presents Sounds of the 70s on BBC Radio 2. Three CDs is a lot to maintain the quality threshold and by the time we reach the final collection the songs are a pale representation of what's gone before (although \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\" still has its merits). But it's good to have a substantial collection that shows the diversity of the man and his band.\\" Chris Roberts of Uncut stated: \\"Harley's ever-changing band slid perfectly into the post-Ziggy/Roxy slipstream, all mannered English vocals, florid lyrics and sexual-theatrical rock. Tricksy hits like \\"Judy Teen\\" and \\"Mr Soft\\" displayed arch wit, whilst fan favourite \\"Sebastian\\" was a quite wonderful seven-minute epic. After the all-conquering \\"Make Me Smile\\", it was as if Harley was sated. His subsequent albums, both solo and under the band name, were measured and less edgy.\\" References 2006 compilation albums ","title":"The Cockney Rebel ‚Äì A Steve Harley Anthology"},{"id":"38616022","text":"Henry Oswald Hodgson FRCO (6 November 1886 - 21 August 1975) was an organist and composer based in England.

Quinn made his first appearance for the Tipperary team during the 1953-54 National League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until he was dropped from the panel after the 1956 championship. He subsequently lined out with Dublin for one season. During that time he won one National Hurling League medal. At club level Quinn began his career with Rahealty before playing with Faughs. His son, Niall Quinn, is a former professional association footballer who played for English Premier League teams Arsenal, Manchester City and Sunderland and received 92 caps for the Republic of Ireland national football team. His death at the age of 80 was announced on 17 January 2016. Playing career=Inter-county= Quinn first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Tipperary minor hurling team in 1951. Tipperary lost their provincial title to Cork. In 1952 Quinn won his first Munster medal following a 10-7 to 1-3 trouncing of Clare. Tipperary subsequently reached the All-Ireland final. Dublin provided the opposition on that occasion, however, Tipperary trounced the Metropolitans by 9-9 to 2-3 giving Quinn an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal in the minor grade. Quinn was appointed captain of the Tipperary minor team for 1953. He collected a second Munster medal that year when Tipperary beat Limerick by 3-11 to 3-3. The All-Ireland final saw Quinn's side defeat Dublin by 8-6 to 3-6. It was a second successive All-Ireland medal for Quinn while he also had the honour of collecting the cup. Having finished with the Tipperary minor team in 1953, Quinn subsequently joined the Tipperary senior team. He won a National Hurling League medal in 1954 following a 3-10 to 1-4 defeat of Kilkenny. Championship success eluded Tipperary over the next few years and, following a Munster semi-final defeat by Cork in 1956, Quinn was dropped from the panel. A move from London back to Ireland in the late 1950s saw Quinn line out with Dublin. A change of rules saw non-Dublin players dropped from the team shortly afterwards. =Inter- provincial= Quinn also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial series of games.

They shot footage of numerous punk rock and new wave bands at CBGB, the downtown music club, which in 1975 had been open only two years. Much of Metropolis Video's work was shown on public access cable television. In October 1977 there was a two-day show of their work at The Kitchen, New York‚Äôs premiere avant-garde and experimental arts center, which was located in SoHo at that time. The New York Times music critic John Rockwell wrote that because of Metropolis Video's work and their cable TV series, \\"the efflorescence of the New York underground rock scene at the CBGB club will live on past the present moment. History Pat Ivers of Metropolis Video shooting Orchestra Luna at CBGB's in 1975 In 1975, seven film and videomakers who were then in their early 20s, Paul Dougherty, John Hazard, Jeff Hodges, Pat Ivers, Steven Lawrence, Michael Owen and Tom Zafian, came together to document the early punk rock scene at CBGB, which in 1975 was a relatively new music club on The Bowery, in Manhattan, New York City. The members of Metropolitan Video met while they were working at Manhattan Cable TV's public access television (MCTV) department, where community members could get free training in video production, borrow equipment and schedule their programs for broadcast. In 1972 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had mandated that cable TV systems in the top 100 markets must provide public access, and by 1975, MCTV had become a major distribution hub for video experimentation, the YouTube of its day. Facade of CBGB, New York In August 1975, Metropolis Video members convinced CBGB's owner Hilly Kristal to let them shoot performances. The group descended into the then little-known club with a multi-camera, live-switched, live-mixed audio/video system and despite the limitations of their set up, produced some of the most complete documentation of the early New York punk rock music scene in existence. The collection of videos is now represented by Historic Films. After the dissolution of Metropolis Video in 1977, filmmaker Pat Ivers continued to film the New York punk scene together with Emily Armstrong in a project called Advanced TV, later dubbed GoNightclubbing. Programs Metropolis Video‚Äôs first project, the CBGB Festival of Unrecorded Bands, in August 1975, captured Blondie, Joe and Blake, The Heartbreakers with Richard Hell (their third live performance), and the Talking Heads (as a trio). Metropolis Video shot the Talking Heads on two other occasions, in October and December 1975. The December concert is excerpted in the 2011 film produced by Eagle Rock Entertainment, Talking Heads: Chronology. Other bands recorded by Metropolis Video at CBGBs were The Shirts, the Tuff Darts (featuring Robert Gordon), Ruby and the Rednecks, and Orchestra Luna. Elephant's Memory was also documented in a show in New Haven in 1976; this was Metropolis Video‚Äôs last project as a group. The Kitchen press release from 1977 Cable television Rock from CBGB's was a three-part series that aired on Manhattan Cable's Public Access Channel D in 1975, showing excerpts from the collection of band performances. Public screenings Metropolis Video's work was shown, in a multi-monitor format, in two sold-out shows called Rock from CBGB's by Metropolis Video at The Kitchen, an art and performance space in Lower Manhattan, on October 6 and 8, 1977. The hour-long event featured performances by Talking Heads, Tuff Darts, Heartbreakers and Orchestra Luna.

It was first broadcast on ITV on 1 January 1990 and was watched by 13.45 million viewers during its original transmission. The episode, written by Ben Elton, Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson, also featured special guest Richard Briers alongside Paul Bown, Rudolph Walker (who would later co-star with Atkinson in The Thin Blue Line) and a cameo appearance by theme music composer Howard Goodall.  Plot = Act 1: The Exam = Mr. Bean is late for a mathematics exam and speeds past a blue Reliant Regal in his Mini (which would become a running gag later throughout the series), running it off the road and nearly overturning it in the process. Arriving at the college he has been attending, Bean finds himself sitting next to a fellow student (Paul Bown) who asks him if he did his revision. Bean replies that he has been concentrating on trigonometry, to which the student says that he has studied calculus. Bean then says he believes calculus was the focus of the test last year, rendering the other student worried while Bean snickers to himself for deceiving him. The invigilator (Rudolph Walker) announces that the exam will start in two minutes. During those two minutes, Bean prepares himself by getting out many pens, as well as a policeman doll, a Pink Panther doll and a Mickey Mouse alarm clock which he sets for when the exam finishes. The exam starts and Bean panics when he takes a calculus paper out of the envelope (as he had not studied calculus at all). He gradually becomes frustrated and has no idea how to complete it, so he resorts to spending most of the exam time trying to cheat and copy the other student's work (even going as far as stealing the student's paper when he becomes distracted at one point), but each attempt fails. Eventually, Bean gives up and cries out \\"Oh, Mummy!\\" before placing his head on the desk and sleeping for the remainder of the exam. Two minutes before the end, the invigilator gives instructions on what to do with the papers once the exam is over. From this, Bean realises that there were two papers in the envelope ‚Äì a green calculus paper and a white trigonometry paper, with each student given a choice as to which to do (although the invigilator logically should have stated this at the beginning). Bean takes out the trigonometry paper and frantically tries to complete it hurriedly, but his pen has run out of ink and won't write anything, so he steals the other student's pen (forgetting about the many spares he came prepared with). Unfortunately, the exam is already over and the invigilator tells the students to stop writing. But Bean is determined to finish the exam and continues, and he finally stops when the invigilator furiously yells \\"WILL YOU STOP WRITING?!\\" for the third time. At this point, his alarm clock rings off and Bean frantically attempts to silence it. = Act 2: The Beach = After his exam, Bean heads to the Peacehaven beach, running the Reliant Regal off the road once again in the process. Reaching the beachfront, he looks forward to his swim in the sea but finds himself unable to change into his swimming trunks without exposing himself to a man (Roger Sloman) wearing sunglasses sitting in a nearby deckchair. Not wishing to travel back up the steps he climbed down to change, he puts his trunks on over his trousers and eventually manages to remove his trousers by pulling one leg out, passing the trouser leg through his trunks and then pulling the trousers off the other leg. Although this plan works, Bean then sees the man grabbing his white cane and leaving, revealing that he was blind all along. = Act 3: The Church = After his beach outing, Bean attends a church service, pushing out the Reliant from its parking space near to the Stanmer Church. Heading inside, he arrives as the opening hymn, Eternal Father, Strong to Save, has finished and takes a seat next to Mr. Sprout (Richard Briers). As the vicar (voiced by Rowan Atkinson off-screen) gives his apparently gibberish sermon, Bean sneezes loudly and finds himself needing to wipe his nose, effectively using the lining of one of his coat pockets to do so as he doesn't have a tissue or handkerchief. Finding the sermon to be very dull, he does everything to keep himself awake, eventually trying to put a sweet into his mouth. However, the watchful eye of Mr. Sprout causes Bean to conceal this a few times, accidentally making him drop it inside his shirt just as the second hymn, All Creatures of Our God and King, is about to be sung. When Mr. Sprout refuses to share his hymnal, Bean does not know the words to the hymn and sings mostly gibberish except during the chorus, where he obnoxiously sings an extremely loud and inappropriately emphasized \\"Hallelujah\\". While the hymn is going on, he manages to move the sweet through his shirt and his trousers, picking it up off the ground. As the hymn comes to an end, Bean attempts to eat it only for Mr. Sprout to abruptly look his way at the last second and make him accidentally put it into the pocket he used to wipe his nose and he grimaces. As the end credits roll, Mr. Bean is seen again driving in his Mini and once again encounters the Reliant, whereupon he turns the wrong way down a one-way street and crashes his car (off-screen) while the Reliant drives off. Coming out unscathed, Bean promptly runs off down the other road, shortly after a wheel from his Mini bounces from the accident and rolls against the pavement.

Thames Television commissioned the pilot in 1989. The company's head of light entertainment, John Howard Davies, personally oversaw the first three episodes of the series as its producer and director. The pilot itself was produced during the latter part of 1989, with location scenes filmed on OB videotape around the Peacehaven and Stanmer areas of East Sussex and interior scenes recorded before a live audience at Thames' Teddington Studios complex. As the episode was merely a pilot, it was simply called \\"Mr. Bean\\" and did not feature opening titles, nor the choral theme tune. Instead, the episode's title was superimposed along with initial credits during the scene of Bean's journey to the exam hall, with the closing credits during the final scene. = Awards and legacy = The pilot won the 1990 Golden Rose award, with the church sketch later performed live by both Rowan Atkinson and Angus Deayton as part of a comedy tour in 1991. This same sketch inspired the storyline for \\"Ray of Sunshine\\" from Mr. Bean: The Animated Series.

The essay was written in 1919 but published in 1921 with a series of short stories called Monday or Tuesday. The essay is a criticism of writers and literature from the previous generation. It also acts as a guide for writers of modern fiction to write what they feel, not what society or publishers want them to write. Synopsis In \\"Modern Fiction\\", Woolf elucidates upon what she understands modern fiction to be. Woolf states that a writer should write what inspires them and not follow any special method. She believed writers are constrained by the publishing business, by what society believes literature should look like and what society has dictated how literature should be written. Woolf believes it is a writer's job to write the complexities in life, the unknowns, not the unimportant things.Gutenburg Project EssaysWoolf, Virginia. \\"Modern Fiction\\". The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Twentieth Century and Beyond. Ed. Joseph Black. 2006. 227. Print. She criticizes H.G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, John Galsworthy of writing about unimportant things and called them materialists. She suggests that it would be better for literature to turn their backs on them so it can move forward, for better or worse. While Woolf criticizes the aforementioned three authors, she praises several other authors for their innovation. This group of writers she names spiritualists, and includes James Joyce who Woolf says writes what interests and moves him. Woolf wanted writers to focus on the awkwardness of life and craved originality in their work. Woolf's overall hope was to inspire modern fiction writers to write what interested them, wherever it may lead. Themes=Virginia Woolf as critic= Virginia Woolf was known as a critic by her contemporaries and many scholars have attempted to analyse Woolf as a critic. In her essay, \\"Modern Fiction\\", she criticizes H.G. Wells, Arnold Bennett and John Galsworthy and mentions and praises Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, William Henry Hudson, James Joyce and Anton Chekhov. As a critic, she does not take an analytical point of view and it is believed to be due to the influences of impressionism at the time that she was able to do so.Fishman, Solomon. \\"Virginia Woolf on the Novel\\". The Sewanee Review 51.2 (1943): 321‚Äì340. Jstor. Web. 21 February 2012.Goldman, Mark. \\"Virginia Woolf and the Critic as Reader\\". PMLA 80.3 (1965): 275‚Äì284. Jstor. Web. 21 February 2012. Her writing and criticism was often done by intuition and feelings rather than by a scientific, analytical or systematic method.Madison, Elizabeth C. \\"The Common Reader and Critical Method in Virginia Woolf\\". Journal of Aesthetic Education 15.4 (1981): 61‚Äì73. Jstor. Web. 21 February 2012. Virginia Woolf says of criticism: Woolf speaks of criticism as being vague rather than concrete. In her criticism within \\"Modern Fiction\\" of H.G. Wells for instance, she is vague in what is wrong with writings but focuses more on the abstract ideals for his fiction rather his work. Woolf's body of essays offer criticism on a variety and diverse collection of literature in her unsystematic method. =Woolf's analysis of Russian versus British literature= In \\"Modern Fiction\\", Woolf takes the time to analyse Anton Chekhov's \\"Gusev\\" and in general, how Russians write. Woolf spent time polishing translated Russian texts for a British audience with S.S.KotelianskiiBeasley, Rebecca. \\"On Not Knowing Russian: The Translation of Virginia Woolf and S.S. Kotelianskii\\". Modern Humanities Research Association 108.1 (2013): 1 -29. Jstor. Web. 21 February 2012. which gave her perspectives she used to analyse the differences between British literature and Russian literature. Woolf says of Russian writers: To Woolf, Russian writers see something entirely different in life than the British. In comparison to Russian writers and authors, Woolf says of British literature: Due to Woolf's work in polishing translations, she was able to see the differences between Russian and British authors. Yet she also knew that \\"from the comparison of two fictions so immeasurably far apart are futile save indeed as they flood us with a view of infinite possibilities of the art\\". Woolf's main purpose in comparing the two culturally different writers was to show the possibilities that modern fiction would be able to take in the future. =Woolf, writers and fiction= Woolf's \\"Modern Fiction\\" essay focuses on how writers should write or what she hopes for them to write. Woolf does not suggest a specific way to write. Instead, she wants writers to simply write what interests them in any way that they choose to write. Woolf suggests, ‚ÄúAny method is right, every method is right, that expresses what we wish to express, if we are writers; that brings us closer to the novelist's intention if we are readers\\". Woolf wanted writers to express themselves in such a way that it showed life as it should be seen not as \\"a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged\\". She set out to inspire writers of modern fiction by calling for originality, criticizing those who focused on the unimportant things, and comparing the differences of cultural authors, all for the sake of fiction and literature.

In its upper reaches it is known as the Scow brook, much of which was inundated by the Carsington Water reservoir in 1991. It becomes the Henmore brook in the middle reaches, where there are three tributaries called the Parkside, Kniveton and Dayfield brooks. The brook drains a catchment of mixed geology, which has an area of 46 square kilometres (18 square miles). It flows through the market town of Ashbourne, where flooding of the town centre by the brook has historically caused significant damage. The brook is designated as a Main river by the Environment Agency from the outflow at Carsington Water to the confluence with the River Dove. Course The source of the brook is at the base of Soldiers Knoll near Stainsborough Hall, from where it flows west until it reaches the upper end of Carsington Water near Hopton. It reappears at the outlet of the dam, and flows in a south-westerly direction past the villages of Hognaston, Atlow, and Sturston until it reaches the town of Ashbourne. Downstream of the town it passes the village of Clifton before reaching its confluence with the River Dove at Church Mayfield. History There has been a long history of human presence and settlement in the Henmore valley, with many Palaeolithic sites both in the north near Carsington, with round barrows and standing stones, and other tumuli in the sandstone hills south of Ashbourne. A rare Acheulean stone axe was found at Hopton. Early lead mining in the catchment was important enough that a significant Roman settlement was established. This was discovered during archaeological digs that took place beside the Scow Brook prior to the area being inundated by Carsington Water. A Roman lead ingot or 'pig' weighing 69 kg was also discovered nearby in 1946. Ashbourne or Essenburn (a brook where ash trees grow) was included in the Domesday book, and became an important medieval market town, with the road linking Derby to Manchester crossing the brook in the town. The farming community in the Henmore valley supplied the produce for the markets, such as cheese. The brook also passes alongside Atlow moat, a well-preserved example of a medieval manor homestead moat and which was once the home of the Atlow family. There was also a substantial corn mill at Atlow driven by the Henmore, but unlike other mills along the brook the buildings have been renovated for modern use. The Henmore was not employed for cotton spinning during the industrial revolution, which is unusual for a Derbyshire brook, although a number of large cotton mills were established at Church Mayfield where the Henmore meets the River Dove. There were, however, at least two corn mills near Ashbourne that were powered by the Henmore brook at Clifton and Sturston. Although subsequently demolished, they have become the goals for the annual Royal Shrovetide Football match. Royal Shrovetide Football The Henmore brook, or as it is usually called in reference to the game, the River Henmore, is an integral part of the Ashbourne Shrovetide game of Mob football. It determines which team the player joins or supports, those born north of the Henmore are the Up‚ÄôArds and those born to the South are the Down‚ÄôArds. It links the two goals at Sturston and Clifton, and often acts as the pitch as well. This was reinforced in 1996 when to make the game more challenging, the two goals were repositioned on the banks of the river, which meant players needed to be in the river to ‚Äògoal‚Äô the ball. Up'Ards purpose-built goal at Sturston Mill In 2010, play even continued through the culvert beneath the Civic Square. Once out of the town, the banks of the river provide good viewpoints to observe the match.

The CFR was established in 1978, as a result of an agreement between the governments of the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Mozambique. The Centre has been incorporated in Immunities and Privileges Act No. 5 (1986). This incorporation conferred the Centre with the status of a Diplomatic Institution, a status which the Centre continues to enjoy to date. The Centre was originally designed to train nationals of the two countries in the field of International Relations and Diplomacy. However, the expansion of foreign policy constituency and the demands of each country out of global changes enabled the Centre to admit students from other ministries, the private sector as well as other countries. New demanded programmes namely; Economic Diplomacy, Language and Communication Skills and Strategic Studies were introduced in the Centre‚Äôs training programmes. International Relations is an important discipline offered in other higher learning institutions. However, the CFR combines the study of International Relations and Diplomacy into one meaningful training programme. Moreover, the CFR offers a comprehensive programme for the low and medium level government and private sector personnel dealing with International Relations and Diplomacy. The Vision of the Centre is to become a regional Centre of excellence in diplomatic and strategic studies. The Mission of the Centre is to create and sustain national and regional capacity for conflict prevention, management, resolution and early warning systems through research and analysis, policy advocacy and advice, outreach and training.

The plaintiffs, Michael Moore (not the famous filmmaker), Mary Shepard and the Second Amendment Foundation, sought an injunction against Illinois attorney general Lisa Madigan, Illinois Governor Patrick Quinn, and other named defendants, barring them from enforcing two key provisions of the Illinois Statutes prohibiting public possession of a firearm or other weapon. The case was initially dismissed by the Illinois Federal District Court, but a 3-judge panel of the 7th Circuit reversed, and an en banc rehearing was declined by the full Circuit. Madigan and other named Defendants were considering an appeal to the United States Supreme Court prior to July 2013, but the legal case became mooted once the Illinois legislature passed a shall issue concealed carry law that month. Background Illinois State Statutes ¬ß720 ILCS 5/24-1 and ¬ß720 ILCS 5/24-1.6 define the crimes of \\"Unlawful Use of Weapons\\" and \\"Aggravated Unlawful Use of Weapons\\". In part, they state that a person commits a gross misdemeanor when he knowingly \\"Carries or possesses in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person except when on his land or in his own abode, legal dwelling, or fixed place of business, or on the land or in the legal dwelling of another person as an invitee with that person‚Äôs permission, any pistol, revolver, stun gun or taser or other firearm . . . or . . . Carries or possesses on or about his person, upon any public street, alley, or other public lands within the corporate limits of a city, village or incorporated town, except when an invitee thereon or therein, for the purpose of the display of such weapon or the lawful commerce in weapons, or except when on his land or in his own abode, legal dwelling, or fixed place of business, or on the land or in the legal dwelling of another person as an invitee with that person‚Äôs permission, any pistol, revolver, stun gun or taser or other firearm...\\". The offense is a Class 4 felony for a first offense and a Class 2 felony thereafter under the \\"Aggravated\\" variation if, at any time, the weapon possessed by the person was uncased and either loaded or with the ammunition \\"immediately accessible\\". Coupled with lack of exemption based on a carry permit, the like of which did not exist in Illinois, the Statutes effectively prohibit all forms of defensive weapons carry by private citizens. =Shepard v. Madigan, 11-CV-405-WDS= In 2009, Mary E. Shepard, a member of the advocacy group the Illinois State Rifle Association, was performing volunteer duties as treasurer at her church, when she was assaulted and beaten by an intruder and left for dead. Her injuries were numerous and major, including skull fractures, hearing loss, shattered teeth, and vertebral damage, which required many surgeries and extensive physical therapy. An 83-year-old coworker, unnamed in the suit, was also brutalized and badly injured in the attack. Despite possessing a handgun and maintaining the State- required Firearms Owner Identification card (FOID), Shepard was unarmed as required by Illinois statutes during the attack, and asserts that if she had had access to her weapon, she could have fought off her assailant and avoided the injuries to herself and her co-worker. Shepard and the Second Amendment Foundation filed suit in 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, seeking an injunction barring Lisa Madigan, in her capacity as Attorney General for the State of Illinois, from enforcing the sections of the Illinois State Statutes that prohibit public carry of a loaded, functional firearm.Shepard v. Madigan - District Court Memorandum and Order =Moore v. Madigan, 11-CV-03134= On May 12, 2011, plaintiffs Michael Moore, Charles Hooks, IllinoisCarry, and the Second Amendment Foundation filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, Springfield Division, alleging that the same areas of the Illinois State Statutes mentioned in Shepard were facially violative of the U.S. Constitution, specifically the Second Amendment as interpreted by the landmark Supreme Court Cases D.C. v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, and sought an injunction barring enforcement of the statutes.Moore v. Madigan - Complaint, USDC, CD Illinois, Springfield Div. Moore, a Cook County Sheriff's Deputy who retired after 30 years of service, had attempted to obtain the ability to carry a concealed firearm as a retired law enforcement officer under HR 218, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, but Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart declined to issue him one, stating that Deputy Moore had been employed as a corrections deputy, not a \\"road\\" deputy and did not meet the standard. In 2010, Moore and four other retired officers filed a suit in Federal Court against the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board (the agency that administers LEOSA in Illinois) challenging the ID card requirement of LEOSA.Moore v. Trent, 09 C 1712. (N.D. Ill. Dec. 16, 2010), Casetext. Retrieved April 19, 2017. The Court ruled that the plaintiffs had no standing, specifically \\"absent clear statutory intent, a court is precluded from creating a private right of action...\\" and that \\"LEOSA does not provide for a mechanism enabling Plaintiffs to sue\\". District Court In an opinion dated March 30, 2012, Judge William D. Stiehl, presiding for the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Illinois, dismissed the complaint in Shepard v. Madigan. Among his findings were that the Heller, McDonald and subsequent relevant 7th Circuit decisions failed to address the specific assertion of the Plaintiffs, specifically that the right to keep and bear arms outside one's own home is a \\"core\\" protection of the Second Amendment (one whose restriction would be subject to strict scrutiny upon review). Absent such decision, and with text from Heller stating that the historical review in that case did not support the claim that \\"the Second Amendment necessarily extends the right to keep and bear arms to the unfettered right to carry weapons in public\\", Judge Stiehl asserted that in fact this right is not a \\"core\\" protected right of the Second Amendment, and therefore the purpose of the Illinois Statutes, to reduce gun-related crime by restricting the carry of weapons in public to law enforcement officers only, is \\"reasonably adapted to a substantial government interest\\" as required by intermediate scrutiny, and is thus constitutional. Similarly, in Moore v. Madigan, the court, with Judge Sue E. Myerscough presiding, found on February 3, 2012 that Supreme Court and 7th Circuit decisions did not recognize the right to keep and bear arms as extending outside one's own home. Therefore, the court found, the Plaintiffs would be unlikely to prevail with their lawsuit, and so the preliminary injunction motion was denied. Along similar reasoning, the court found that the activities restricted by the Illinois Statutes did not restrict activity expressly protected by the Second Amendment, as the right was understood as of the ratification of the Bill of Rights, and so the defendants' motion to dismiss was granted.Moore v. Madigan - Decision, USDC CD Illinois, Springfield Div Seventh Circuit The plaintiffs in both cases appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, as cases 12-1269 and 12-1788. As the subject matter of the two cases was nearly identical and there was also a high degree of overlap in the field of Plaintiffs and Defendants, the court effectively merged the two cases for purposes of argument and decision as Moore v. Madigan (taking the common name from the first case to be appealed). Arguments were heard on June 8, 2012 before the panel of Circuit Judges Posner, Flaum and Williams, and the decision was published December 11, 2012.Moore v. Madigan - 7th Circuit Opinion and Order In a 2-1 decision (Williams dissenting), the court reversed both District Courts' decisions and orders. Judge Posner, writing for the majority, notes that while the Heller and McDonald decisions did say that the need for self-defense is most acute inside the home, that doesn't mean it is not also acute outside the home. \\"Confrontations are not limited to the home\\". The distinct use of the words \\"keep\\" and \\"bear\\" in the text of the Second Amendment, the court reasoned, implied the right to carry outside one's home, as in historical context, the meaning of the word did not limit it to the home and it would be awkward to attempt to assign that connotation to documents of the time period. The court also reasoned that this limitation would not have been rational as of the ratification of the Bill of Rights, because in what was then the Wild West - including the Ohio River Valley - settlers would have had to contend with native Indians, and such confrontations would be more likely, and more dangerous to an unarmed settler, outside the home rather than in. This negated the Defendants/Appellees' claim that the Blackstone writings and other documents of English origin pointed to a more castle doctrine-based interpretation of the Second Amendment as it would have been understood by the American colonists. While twenty-first century Illinois has no marauding Indian tribes, the threat, from gangs and street thugs, continues, and, says the decision, \\"a Chicagoan is a good deal more likely to be attacked on a sidewalk in a rough neighborhood than in his apartment on the 35th floor of the Park Tower.\\" The decision also rejected the argument that the Illinois laws had an effect on gun crime, noting that Chicago's criminal element was undeterred by the ban on handguns overturned by McDonald. Citing the study, \\"Firearms Laws and the Reduction of Violence: A Systematic Review\\", and several other published studies, the court found that evidence did not support a link between gun regulations and crime rates in either direction. The court, again from the Heller decision, stated \\"Anyway the Supreme Court made clear in Heller that it wasn‚Äôt going to make the right to bear arms depend on casualty counts. (554 U.S. at 636). If the mere possibility that allowing guns to be carried in public would increase the crime or death rates sufficed to justify a ban, Heller would have been decided the other way, for that possibility was as great in the District of Columbia as it is in Illinois.\\" As such, the court held that although the State of Illinois would logically have a substantial interest in reducing gun-related crime and injury/death, the carry ban is not reasonably adapted to this goal and therefore fails even intermediate scrutiny. The Circuit Court ordered the cases remanded to their respective District Courts, with orders that those courts find the laws unconstitutional and institute permanent injunctions. However, as they realized this would leave the State virtually without any gun laws at all (the overwhelming majority of its policy on the subject hinging on these two overturned sections of law), the Court of Appeals stayed these mandates for 180 days, allowing the Illinois Legislature sufficient time to attempt to craft a law that met constitutional review, implying that such laws would have to allow the public carry of firearms in some form. That 180-day stay expires on June 8, 2013; should the Legislature not act by that time, the injunction would take effect and the State of Illinois would technically become an \\"unrestricted\\" state with regard to concealed carry. On March 13, 2013, the 7th Circuit denied the Defendants' petition for en banc rehearing before the full 10-judge Court, tacitly affirming the panel decision. Four of the ten judges dissented in that decision. On April 29, 2013 Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan asked the Supreme Court of the United States for an extension to file a writ of certiorari.Moore v. Madigan - SCOTUS extension Legacy After the initial panel decision, the Chicago aldermen and mayor Rahm Emanuel vowed to continue the fight, both by supporting appeals to the Supreme Court and to craft a city ordinance reaffirming the ban on public carry, even in opposition to any State statutes.Yahoo News - Chicago vows to fight concealed carry ruling Currently, there is no appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, although spokesmen for the Illinois Attorney General's office said that AG Lisa Madigan was considering one immediately following the panel decision. A later news story by the San Francisco Chronicle indicated that Madigan was declining to appeal to SCOTUS following the Circuit Court's en banc denial; however, Governor Quinn, a named defendant in the suit (and thus with standing to appeal), is still supporting an appeal to SCOTUS. After the full court denied en banc hearing, the Chicago Tribune reportedChicago Tribune: Prosecutors, judges ignore federal ruling against state concealed carry ban that Illinois law enforcement, prosecutors and judges are continuing to arrest, charge and convict persons accused of illegally carrying concealed firearms in certain parts of the state, while law enforcement and prosecutors in a number of rural counties had stopped prosecuting individuals for simply carrying firearms without a demonstration of some other malicious intent. A Cook County court ruled, based on a 1971 State Supreme Court decision, that in the absence of a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals decision does not apply to Illinois. Legal experts reject this, stating that while the decision does not apply to the actual courts, the law enforcement officials and prosecuting attorneys can face federal contempt-of-court charges for these actions. Other decisions currently pending hearing or appeal assert that, due to the stay, the state laws remain in effect and thus prosecutable until June 9. On June 3, 2013, the Illinois Legislature passed a \\"shall-issue\\" concealed-carry bill, which would allow handgun owners with a valid FOID who paid a $150 fee and attended 16 hours of training to obtain a concealed-carry license. In a compromise between representatives of the Chicago area and other large cities, and those from smaller cities and rural areas, the bill preempts any local ordinances governing possession and use of handguns, allows storage of a handgun by a person with a carry permit in an automobile, even if that vehicle is parked in an otherwise prohibited place, and allows concealed carry into food service establishments that make less than 50% of their revenue from sales of alcohol \\"by the drink\\" (a common delineation point in the laws of many States between \\"restaurants\\" and \\"bars\\"). However, in concession to the interests of the Chicago area, mass transit buses and trains, schools, other government buildings, parks, hospitals and street festivals are designated \\"gun-free\\". The bill passed both the State House and Senate by large margins (89-28 and 45-12 respectively, well over the 2/3 margin required to override a veto), but as of June 11, still awaited action by Governor Patrick Quinn, named in Moore and who supports an appeal to SCOTUS. On June 4, the 7th Circuit issued one 30-day extension of the original stay, allowing Governor Quinn and his staff time to review the law passed by the Legislature and decide on a course of action. The 7th Circuit's ruling invalidating former Illinois law did not take effect until July 9, 2013. The court indicated it would not extend the stay again, so were the law not passed, in order for the State to maintain the ban, SCOTUS would have had to stay the Circuit Court's ruling. On July 9, 2013 the Illinois General Assembly voted to override Governor Quinn's veto of the bill passed in early June, now giving Illinois a legal framework for issuing concealed carry permits. Illinois was the last U.S. state to allow concealed carry of guns.McCune, Greg (July 9, 2013). \\"Illinois Is Last State to Allow Concealed Carry of Guns\\", Reuters. Retrieved July 20, 2013.

The HD1 subchannel is the same Urban radio format as its standard FM signal, as required by law. For the longest time, operation of the HD2 subchannel was contracted to the EMF, and like most HD capable urban stations, carried the Air 1 network. On February 1, 2019, operation of the HD2 subchannel passed to the Association For Community Education, which now repeats the programming of KMRO and carries that station's Spanish- language religious programming; in effect, now carrying the Nueva Vida (Spanish for New Life) network, the affiliation moved from AM station KSDO. FM translator K253AD, on 98.5 FM relays the HD2 subchannel,https://fccdata.org/?lang=en&facid;=156524 as KSSX already reaches North County, having Carlsbad as its city of license. In the light of the George Floyd protests, iHeart terminated the agreement with the Association for Community Education in June 2020, and replaced it with news radio. It began airing programming from the Black Information Network later that summer. The translator will shut down in early 2021, after which the subchannel is expected to simulcast KFOO, the Inland Empire BIN affiliate. =Competition= As of 2020, KSSX primarily competes with XHITZ-FM.

Producers and directors Women's pornography is produced and directed by women, and it is intended for the female audience. One of the goals of women's pornography is to produce something that the customers want to see and will enjoy. This type of porn is a minority on the internet, but is high quality, based on women's actual feedback. It is a common misconception for people to assume that women are not as easily aroused by sexually explicit images as men. Women that produce porn believe that male-produced porn ignores the sexuality of women and objectifies them. Anti-pornography feminists believe that the solution to this is to abolish pornography, but pro-pornography feminists think the solution is create porn that attends to women's sexuality. Pornography produced by women is placed in the category \\"romance\\" by the Adult Video News awards. This new category was added to the AVN awards in 2010. The AVN awards are movie awards that recognize writers, directors, and producers for their achievements in the creation of American pornographic films. Women's porn directors focus on different styles, but pay particular attention to the actual story, the actors, music, locations, and aesthetics of the scenes. The directors main concern is making sure women enjoy the porn by making it realistic. The women's porn industry allows more women to have control and be in positions of power as directors. The directors encourage the performers to voice their creative input and hold more power than in pornography that is not women's pornography. Erika Lust is a feminist porn director, producer, and screenplay writer. She is also the founder of Erika Lust Films. Lust got her start in directing and producing feminist adult films because she found mainstream porn \\"unrelatable, unimaginative, and unattractive\\", so she wanted to do something about it. In 2005, Erika began to film her series called XConfessions. Lust Productions subscribers submitted their fantasies to Erika and she picked two each month to film for her new series. In everything Lust produces, she wants the viewer to see realistic scenarios, real characters, and real pleasure. For Lust, an important component in feminist porn is consent and respect; making sure the actors want to participate and that they want to experience arousal. Lust's films want to demonstrate real passion and connection between the actors. Lust says, \\"We make love, not porn. And we do all this with a feminine, aesthetic and innovative approach.\\" Angie Rowntree is a director, writer and producer of women‚Äôs pornography who got her start in the 1990s, launching her flagship site, Sssh.com, in 1999. Of female porn directors, Rowntree says ‚ÄúThere may not be a lot of us, but we‚Äôre passionate about what we do, and we‚Äôre working hard every day to provide women with porn that does appeal to them.‚Äù Rowntree said Sssh‚Äôs mission is straightforward: ‚ÄúWe want to create movies that our customers want to see and enjoy watching. The only real difference between what I do and what producers of ‚Äòtypical‚Äô porn do is that I‚Äôm serving a different audience, and instead of assuming we know what they want to see, we ask them what they want to see.‚Äù  Contrast to mainstream pornography  Mainstream porn depicts women as objects for men's pleasure, with no concern for the female performer's comfort or respect. Although the majority of porn audiences are male, more women are opening up about their interest and how they would prefer porn that considers female viewers and isn't as crude or rough as mainstream pornography. A number of women are dedicated to creating this alternative to mainstream porn. They care about making films that don't include horny schoolgirls, naughty nurses, or \\"bad step-mom and daughter\\" relationships. They also banish stereotypes about women's sexuality and expectations surrounding body shape and size. The ideology is founded on a belief that sexual activity in a patriarchal society is intrinsically male and that male sexuality is naturally aggressive or destructive. Furthermore, it assumes that women cannot choose to be free participants in an industry that's purpose is to satisfy the male gaze and contributes to male aggression. Radical feminist scholar and writer Andrea Dworkin named male power as the ‚Äú‚Äòraison d‚Äôetre‚Äô of pornography,‚Äù as well as stating that pornography in itself is a means for expressing male power in her 1981 book ‚ÄúPornography: Men Possessing Women.‚Äù Jae Woong Shim, author of Analysis of Representation of Sexuality on Women‚Äôs and Men‚Äôs Pornographic Websites, describes her work, ‚ÄúWe investigated how the sexuality of men and women is represented on pornographic websites aimed at women and pornographic websites aimed at men. We analyzed 200 pornographic images randomly selected from 4 websites (2 aimed at women and 2 aimed at men). The criteria for comparison were based on concepts of sexual inequality and sexual objectification that have been commonly used in the literature on analyses of pornography content. The findings showed that websites containing pornography aimed at men were more likely than the websites aimed at women to include content with elements of sexual inequality, whereas websites aimed at women were more likely than the websites aimed at men to include content with elements of sexual objectification.\\" Erika Lust has a lot to say about how women's pornography differs from mainstream porn, ‚ÄúPornography has been made by and for men. In mainstream porn everything is about male pleasure and women are objects. Oral sex for men can last forever, but when women's turn comes it lasts 10 seconds. Female orgasms are not an issue in most of the films. And women are shown mostly as prostitutes, which is sad. Mainstream porn lacks creativity and a narrative. They only care about sets of genitals banging together as the woman enjoys fake pleasure until they get their money shot. The man is enjoying his orgasm with no thought to the woman‚Äôs pleasure at all. The performer‚Äôs are cloned stereotypes, everybody abiding to the same standards. Body hair is seen as something undesirable, or God forbid if you‚Äôre not thin and muscular like an action man. There are no interesting stories, relatable characters, or good sex. It‚Äôs bad sex that‚Äôs given porn a bad name. I want others to continue to be inspired by the work I do, I want to encourage other women to get into leading roles within the adult film industry, as directors, producers, and scriptwriters. That way we can get more of the porn we want out there and express our perspective, our desires, and our pleasure. I create an environment which satisfies the viewer with realistic interpretations of real fantasies. The performers look like and play characters that are like the guy or girl on the street, they are natural, individual and attractive in their own unique way. The sex is real, you can see the pleasure. To get excited women want to see something that looks like us. We want to see independent women exploring their sexuality, who are not afraid, but are not sex heroines either. We want to see attractive men who share our lifestyles, our ideas. My films portray men and women as equals with consideration to everyone‚Äôs pleasure, fantasies, and desires. Viewers can see themselves in my films, they feel like they could live out that scenario. That‚Äôs what makes it more satisfying, erotic, and fun!‚Äù Performers Porn stars have differing views on the idea of women's pornography. Some performers embrace the movement, like Asa Akira, an award-winning porn star. Akira stated ‚ÄúI‚Äôm part of the new era of porn. We‚Äôre feminists, very sex-positive people. We‚Äôre not victims of rape, not drug addicts, we don‚Äôt have any daddy issues.‚Äù Some performers also note the problems in the industry and then turn to directing themselves, like Madison Young. Young felt that most mainstream adult film videos lacked substance and sent confusing and potentially harmful signals about sex and body image to viewers. As a result, she turned to directing to add to the new movement of porn. Madison makes sure to include verbal consent, body positivity, and inclusiveness to all her performances. Meanwhile, other performers fail to see the need for a specific type of porn just for women. As porn star James Deen put it, ‚ÄúWhy is there porn explicitly only for women? By saying there needs to be porn for women, you‚Äôre basically isolating women as a gender, and saying, ‚ÄúThis is how women should think. This is how their sexuality should be.‚Äù It's counterproductive (from what I understand) to the equality movement.‚Äù  Characteristics  In a lot of typical pornography, women are mistreated, disrespected, and degraded; this is accepted as normal and is expected to appeal to a male audience states Bryan J. Lowder, writer for the magazine Everyday Feminism. He elaborates that most pornographic movies are filmed by men in a way that allows their target male audience to portray themselves in the role. As a result, women are presented as objects of desire and not as subjects of pleasure. In women‚Äôs pornography, however, the main function is fulfilling the desires of a woman audience. As a result, the focus emphasizes women as subjects of pleasure reaching real orgasms. Women‚Äôs pornography audio that emphasizes what is being felt; the use of the female voice to display pleasure enhances the performance of orgasms. The camera shots, such as close-ups of the face, also emphasize pleasure and emotion. Other camera shots that are sometimes used include angles that display the faces of the male performers, rather than just their penises, in attempt to eroticize the male body more. Showing more of the male bodies negates the objectification of the female body in typical porn. Furthermore, women‚Äôs pornography pays special attention to the care of performers by ensuring their comfort and consent with their performance and performance partners. Director Erika Lust says mainstream porn is \\"fake\\" and \\"crappy\\", instead she wants to show \\"real sex\\". Not being slandered and disrespected by a man is what women's pornography is supposed to look like. Women's pornography portrays real connections and real pleasure.  Individualist feminism and sex-positive pornography  Individualist feminism considers that each woman can individually undertake the responsibility of making her decisions, deciding her actions, and controlling her own life - \\"for example without trying to put some failures onto the account of gender differences.\\" As with liberal feminism, Individualist feminist focus on the ability for women to be metaphorically freed from the taboos and prejudices of sex within society, while also allowing women to become a sexually active element. Typically, the male is considered the sexually active element in a sexual act, while the female is passive. Individualist feminism as well as sex-positive feminism is attempting to change the view that the male is the active member of sex by creating an equality between the two so that male and female are both passive and active. An individualist feminist view upon pornography is that both male and female derive pleasure from consuming the pornography. Women state that they \\"see their consumption of pornography as both a source of sexual pleasure and affirmation of their sexual identities, as well as an exercise of freedom of choice.\\" Another belief that is shared within the Individualist feminist community is that pornography should be legalized. This thought is derived from reasoning that female pornographic actors would no longer be subject to the stigma placed upon them by society while allowing women to control and censor themselves and their sexuality individually. In correlation to making pornography legal, prostitution would become legal, supporting the idea that women could individually censor and control their actions and sexuality. Wendy McElroy, a prominent individualist feminist, shared her views of pornography by saying \\"Individual feminism insists on the principle of self-ownership: a woman's body, a woman's right. It insists that women be free to choose, regardless of the content of their choices.\\" McElroy's quote embodies the ideals behind women's pornography according to individualist feminism and leads to the thought process that a woman can exploit her sexuality using her own discretion, through lesbianism, pornography, masturbation, or any consensual sexual act.  Statistics  There are many concerns that mainstream, male oriented pornography causes rape and sexual aggression in males, calling for more porn created by women for women. A study by Berl Kutchinsky showed that rape crimes did not increase with increased access to pornography, despite popular misconceptions. It is important to note, however, that this study took place prior to widespread access to the internet. A response to Kutchinsky by Steven Alan Childress notes that his study contrasts many other studies, and that he only measures reported ‚Äúserious‚Äù rapes (not including date rape, etc.). In addition, Kutchinsky focuses on the availability of pornography rather than consumption. Women consume pornography differently than men. Pornhub's statistics from 2017 show that 26% of the site's average global visitors have indicated that they are women. The site reported that 36% of its total visitors who indicated to be female accessed the site from the Philippines, while 25% accessed it from the US and Canada, and 19% from Japan. Additionally, Pornhub data shows the most searched terms and most viewed content by its male and female users. For women, the top five most searched terms were: \\"Women on women ('lesbian')\\", \\"Lesbian scissoring\\", \\"Threesome\\", \\"Hentai\\", and \\"Japanese\\", while men searched for: \\"Milf\\", \\"Stepmom\\", \\"Japanese\\", \\"Hentai\\", and \\"Mom\\". The top five most viewed categories for women were: \\"Women on women ('lesbian')\\", \\"Threesome\\", \\"Big Dick\\", \\"Popular with Women\\", and \\"Ebony\\".

These four towers are located in following areas of today's Bangalore: near Mekhri circle, inside Lalbagh park, near Kempambudhi Lake and the last one near Ulsoor Lake. Many of the city's current lakes and markets and the Bull temple date back to Kempegowda's time. The move to set up the museum to honor the city's founder was first proposed in 2000 though there was no progress for many years. The execution of museum idea only started when the Samithis (committees) for Kempegowda Smaraka Vastu Sanghrahalaya (Kempegowda memorial museum) and Adyayana Kendra (Learning Center) were founded in the year 2005. The museum was finally opened on 7 April 2011. The museum was inaugurated by Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa. Building One of the four Kempegowda built towers which signified the town limits of early Bangalore is located in Lalbagh. The Kempe Gowda Museum is housed is the first floor of the heritage building of Mayo Hall. The building has been painted in the Cantonment colors of red and white. Mayo Hall's upper storey was earlier reserved for public meetings free of charge while the ground floor housed the municipal offices. Until the year 2010, the Mayor of Bangalore's meetings were held on the first floor. The adjoining blocks of the building which were built in 1904, now house a variety of courts and public offices were previously referred to as ‚Äòstation public offices‚Äô. When a visitor enters the building, they can view the floor plan of the museum's first floor gallery. The impressive wooden stairs that lead to museum have old paintings of Bangalore and its nearby forts, made by British surveyors. Museum design A framed map of 18th century Bangalore forms the entire base of the main hall with the four corners of the room having tower shaped panels to symbolise the four watch towers (fixed boundaries) of earlier town. The panels in the four corners display information about the locations of Kempegowda's towers in the current city. There are display panels located on the walls in between the towers showcase information with photographs and illustrations. The museum concept was planned and implemented by Design Core, a design firm. The chief designer of the museum is K.N. Suryaprakash. Historian and folklorist and H.K. Rajegowda wrote the text that accompanies the pictures on display in the museum. Collections The Museum is dedicated to the Yelahanka chieftain Kempegowda(1513-1569) who is the founder of Bangalore city. =Heritage Bangalore map = An interesting experience of the museum is the floor.

Basile and eventually received or won his degree in architecture, which at the time was a prize conferred through a competition. He also taught physics at university, and at the atheneum, taught descriptive geometry and its applications. As a young man, he published his text on Practical Stereotomy. He continued the study of figure drawing under the painter Salvatore Lo Forte. Completed such studies, Tineo sponsored some years of study at the University of Rome (La Sapienza) in architecture. There he took courses given by Tortolini, Venturoli, and dal Cavalieri. He also attended the Accademia di San Luca, and designed under Sarti and Poletti. He also was a disciple of the engraver of antiquities, Luigi Canina, before the latter was called to occupy an honorary position at the Royal Institute of British Architects. Basile performed studies on ancient and antique art and monuments, including the temples of Fortuna Virilis, Vesta, and Giove Tonante (Thundering Jove), and the tombs of Bibulus and Scipio, and the ruins of Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli. In this era, a number of artists from Naples and Sicily were sponsored by the public to study in Rome; among these artists were Domenico Morelli, ill Cipolla, and Francesco Di Bartolo.

NASIC assessments of aerospace performance characteristics, capabilities, and vulnerabilities are used to shape national security and defense policies and supports weapons treaty negotiations and verification. History In 1917 the Foreign Data Section of the Army Signal Corps‚Äô Airplane Engineering Department was established at McCook Field, and a NASIC predecessor operated the Army Aeronautical Museum of the Material Division, August 22, 1935. The Office of the Chief of Air Corps's Information Division had become the OCAC Intelligence Division by 1939, which transferred into the USAAF as AC/AS, Intelligence and was known as A-2 (in April, 1942, the Air Intelligence School was at the Harrisburg Academy.) The United States Army Air Forces evaluated foreign aircraft during World War II with the \\"T-2 Intelligence Department at Wright Field and Freeman Field, Indiana\\". In July 1944, Wright Field analysts fired a V-1 engine reconstructed from \\"Robot Blitz\\" wreckage (an entire V-1 was reconstructed at Republic Aviation by September 8).U.S. Air Force Tactical Missiles, (2009), George Mindling, Robert Bolton Post-war, Operation Lusty recruited German technology experts who were interrogated prior to working in the United States, e.g., Dr. Herbert Wagner at a Point Mugu USMC detachment and Walter Dornberger at Bell Aircraft. The \\"capability‚Ä¶anticipated for Soviet intercontinental jet bombers\\" (e.g., in NSC 20/4 in the fall of 1945) determined a Radar Fence was needed for sufficient U.S. warning and that the \\"1954 Interceptor\\" (F-106) was needed (specified in the January 13, 1949, Air Development Order): \\"the appearance of a Soviet jet bomber [was in the] 1954‚Ä¶May Day parade\\". \\"By 1944, it had become obvious that German aeronautical technology was superior in many ways, to that of this country, and we needed to obtain this technology and make use of it,\\" said P-47 and Messerschmitt ME-262 pilot Army Air Forces Lieutenant Roy Brown during a speech at NASIC in 2014. To accomplish this task, then Col Harold E. Watson was sent from Wright Field to Europe in 1944, to locate German aircraft of advanced design. Watson would become an integral part of forming the intelligence unit that would eventually become NASIC. =Air Technical Intelligence Center= On May 21, 1951, the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) was established as a USAF field activity of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence. ATIC analyzed engine parts and the tail section of a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 and in July, the center received a complete MiG-15 that had crashed. ATIC also obtained IL-10 and Yak-9 aircraft in operational condition, and monitored a captured MiG-15's flight test program. ATIC awarded a contract to Battelle Memorial Institute for translation and analysis of materiel and documents gathered during the Korean War. Analysis allowed FEAF to develop fighter engagement tactics. In 1958 ATIC had a Readix Computer in Building 828, 1 of 6 WPAFB buildings used by the unit prior to the center built in 1976. Discoverer 29 (launched April 30, 1961) then photographed the \\"first Soviet ICBM offensive launch complex\\" at Plesetsk. The Defense Intelligence Agency was created on October 1. =Foreign Technology Division= In 1961 ATIC became the Foreign Technology Division (FTD) which was reassigned to Air Force Systems Command (AFSC), and FTD intelligence estimates were subsequently provided to the National Security Council through the 1962 United States Intelligence Board (cf. the CIA's Board of National Estimates). FTD's additional location at the Tonopah Test Range Airport conducted test and evaluation of captured Soviet fighter aircraft (AFSC recruited its pilots from the Edwards AFB Air Force Test Center). The aircraft of the 1966 Iraqi Air Force MiG-21 defection was transferred to Nevada within a month of the flight, and the 1968 US Air Force and Navy HAVE DOUGHNUT project flew the aircraft at Area 51 for simulated air combat training (renamed HAVE DRILL and transferred to the Tonopah TTR ). U.S. casualties flying foreign aircraft included those in the 1979 Tonopah MiG-17 crash during training versus a Northrop F-5 and the 1984 Little Skull Mountain MiG-23 crash which killed a USAF general.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GDtFAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=pLsMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5828,221561&dq;=nellis+air+force+range&hl;=en FTD detachments were located in Virginia, California (Det 2), Germany, Japan (Det 4), and Det 5‚Äîfirst in Massachusetts and later Colorado (Buckley ANGB).

He places the number of deaths during the deportations, which he calls \\"forced relocations\\", at no higher than 9,000-10,000 (as opposed to the 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 that is widely stated by those who acknowledge the genocide).See, for example, Yusuf Hala√ßoƒülu, \\"Realities Behind Relocation,\\" in Armenians in the Late Ottoman Period, ed.

He spent three years on a scholarship in post-doctoral research in Paris where he studied Chinese under Henri Maspero, Tibetan under Jacques Bacot, and Mongolian and Inner Asian languages under Paul Pelliot. From 1928 to 1930 he engaged in field research in Inner Mongolia, and, while staying in lamaseries, mastered Chakhar, Kharchin and Dagur, while collecting extensive sources in manuscript. He later described the results of his investigations into Mongolian Buddhist canon, totalling 108 works, in his Catalogue du Kanjur mongol, (1942-1944). He obtained a teaching position specializing in Inner Asian studies at P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic University in 1931. After his election as a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1936, he did further fieldwork among both the Moghuls, and the Uzbeks, from 1936-7. In 1940 he assumed the chair of Inner Asian Studies at Budapest, University, where he introduced coursework on Mongolian, Tibetan and Manchu. He also played a key role in the development of Hungarian sinology. In 1949, he was awarded the Kossuth Prize (1949) and in the following year he launched the Acta Orientalia. Among his translations are The Secret History of the Mongols (1962) and the Elegant Sayings of Sakya Pandita (1984). Though much was lost in the upheavals of World War Two, he managed to conserve important texts in old Mongolian, Manchu, Tibetan and Chinese, which he later gave to the Hungarian Academy. He donated his 11,000 volume private library to the Klebelsberg Library - University of Szeged.

He joined the Mexican Army in 1993, but deserted six years later in June 1999. He was later recruited by the Gulf Cartel to work as an enforcer for the drug trafficking organization's new muscle, Los Zetas. As one of the top leaders of the group, Arellano Dom√≠nguez commanded Los Zetas in the coastal state of Veracruz. While operating in the state, he reportedly met with the former state Governor Fidel Herrera Beltr√°n in at least two occasions. Though the information has not been officially confirmed, the accusations against the politician persist. Following a gunfight with Mexican law enforcement in Soledad de Doblado, Veracruz on 3 November 2009, Arellano Dom√≠nguez died from gunshot wound complications. According to the Mexican Navy, the drug lord attempted to defend himself in the shootout with a golden pistol encrusted with diamonds. Criminal career Arellano Dom√≠nguez joined the Mexican Army on 22 February 1993, but deserted on 21 June 1999 and later joined Los Zetas, the former armed wing of the drug trafficking organization known as the Gulf Cartel, which was headed by the imprisoned Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n. Los Zetas is a criminal organization that was formed in the late 1990s and early 2000s by soldiers who left the Mexican military to work as the muscle of the Gulf Cartel. Arellano Dom√≠nguez, along with at least 40 other soldiers, is considered one of the original founders of Los Zetas. He also served as the cartel's leader in Veracruz state. In order to go undetected by law enforcement, he reportedly hid in Veracruz disguised as a businessman from C√≥rdoba, Veracruz. =Political corruption= According to the testimony of 14 protected witnesses, Arellano Dom√≠nguez is alleged to have maintained a some kind of business relationship with former Veracruz Governor Fidel Herrera Beltr√°n. Their first meeting reportedly took place in Chicontepec de Tejeda, where someone captured a picture of the former governor and the drug lord. The second meeting supposedly took place inside a hotel in Coatzacoalcos in 2008. There have been many accusations against Herrera Beltr√°n, who left office in December 2010. Although his term lived a period of relative peace in the state of Veracruz, adversaries have accused him of protecting Los Zetas drug cartel and permitting them to operate in Veracruz. The former governor, however, has \\"energetically rejected\\" the accusations. =Death= Infantry soldiers of the Mexican Navy engaged in a shootout with gunmen of Los Zetas in Soledad de Doblado, Veracruz on 3 November 2009, where Arellano Dom√≠nguez was critically wounded. On his way to the hospital, however, Arellano Dom√≠nguez died from complications from the gunshot wounds. According to Navy reports, Arellano Dom√≠nguez had used a golden M1911 pistol encrusted with his aliases El Gonzo and Z-20 in diamonds. In the clash, the authorities confiscated five vehicles, four motorcycles, a MP5 submachine gun, a grenade, four pistols, and seven magazines. They also found several radio communication equipment, three bags of cocaine and pills, and 74,900 pesos (about US$5,909) and US$107. Prior to his death, he was regarded by the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR) as one of the most-wanted Mexican criminals and a top Zeta leader. Two days after his death, organized crime members killed Casto Acevedo Manzano, a former Mexican Army major and delegate of Public Security in Veracruz. His corpse was mutilated by organized crime members and dumped on a street in Soledad de Doblado. Through a written message alongside his corpse, the Gulf Cartel (who at that time worked with Los Zetas) took credit for the execution.

Description  In general, members of subclass Dorylaimia exhibit a great diversity of terrestrial and freshwater species, most of which are large predators or omnivorous free-living species. Some are plant parasites, whereas others are animal parasites (Trichinellida and Mermithida). No members of the Dorylaimia are found in marine habitats. Dorylaimia bear an odontostyle, a protrusible, hollow, needlelike tooth for puncturing and emptying food items.  Taxonomy  Phylogenetic analysis of phylum Nematoda suggests three distinct basal clades, the dorylaims, enoplids, and chromadorids. These represent Clades I, II and C+S of Blaxter (1998). Of these, the first two appear to have sister clade status, allowing resolution into two classes, Enoplea and Chromadorea, and division of the former into two subclasses corresponding to Clades I and II respectively, the Enoplia and Dorylaimia. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that Dorylaimia will eventually be shown to be a distinct third class of nematodes. = Subdivision = Phylogenetic analysis has resulted in a reorganization, with, for instance, moving the Triplonchida to subclass Enoplia. Subclass Dorylaimia is divided into the following orders; **Order Dioctophymatida Baylis and Daubney, 1926 **Order Dorylaimida Pearse, 1942 **Order Isolaimida Cobb, 1920 **Order Marimermithida Rubtzov, 1980 **Order Mermithida Hyman, 1951 **Order Mononchida Jairajpuri, 1969 **Order Muspiceida Bain and Chabaud, 1959 **Order Trichinellida Hall, 1916  References  Further reading    George O.

Directed by Susanne Bier, the film stars Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper as newlyweds running a timber business in 1930s North Carolina. Plot In Depression-era North Carolina, George Pemberton (Bradley Cooper) is an ambitious timber baron who falls in love with Serena Shaw (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman with a sad past. They marry, and Serena joins George on his land and starts to take control, pressuring and questioning George while remaining affectionate. George's business partner Buchanan feels threatened as Serena begins to exceed his authority. The partnership worsens, and Buchanan strikes a deal with the local sheriff, who wants to buy George's land to make a park. George is hurt by Buchanan's betrayal, and Serena convinces him Buchanan was never his friend. On a shooting trip, George and Buchanan go alone to flush out a bear. After Buchanan‚Äôs snide remarks, George contemplates killing him, only to hesitate and be seen by Buchanan. As Buchanan cocks his rifle, George fires first and kills him. Campbell, George's worker, witnesses the murder but denies it to Sheriff McDowell, and the death is ruled an accident. Serena consoles George and justifies his actions. After seeing his illegitimate son Jacob posing with his mother, Rachel, for a picture, George feels responsible for the boy and begins giving Rachel money. Serena remains unaware of this, but considers Rachel and the baby a threat. The mysterious Galloway loses his hand to an axe swing, and Serena uses a belt as a tourniquet and saves his life. George rushes the pregnant Serena to the hospital after she experiences heavy bleeding and pain. She miscarries, and they learn she can never again bear children. Tensions grow, and the parentage of Rachel's baby becomes more obvious to Serena. While Serena and George are away, Campbell finds ledgers in the safe and presents them to the Sheriff, preparing to testify that George has been bribing a senator and shot Buchanan deliberately. Discovering Campbell has taken the ledgers, George and Serena realize he could ruin them. Galloway tells Serena that he knows where Campbell is, and tells George that he knows where the panther is, prompting George to go into the forest to hunt it as Galloway heads into town to find Campbell and retrieve the ledgers. Finding George‚Äôs hidden picture of Rachel and her baby and discovering that George has been giving Rachel money, Serena scratches the baby's face from the photograph. Serena leaves with Galloway, telling George that she has business to take care of. Not finding Rachel at home, they head for the Widow Jenkins‚Äô house. Vaughn calls the Sheriff, worried about Rachel and what Serena plans to do, and the Sheriff goes to Widow Jenkins‚Äô house, finding her dead, and takes Rachel and her baby away. In the morning, the Sheriff questions George, revealing that Galloway killed Campbell and that he suspects they also killed Widow Jenkins and are after Rachel and her child. George asks Serena if she sent Galloway to kill Rachel and Jacob, which she assures him had to be done. George storms out and chokes Serena when she follows him, almost killing her, before driving off. George goes to the Sheriff to turn himself in, agreeing to do so after he tells George where Rachel and the baby are. George races to save Rachel before Galloway finds her. Galloway tracks Rachel to the train station, and she hides in a shed. As the train approaches, George finds Galloway, who sees Rachel jump onto the train. George goes after them and confronts Galloway, managing to slit Galloway‚Äôs throat. George bids Rachel and the baby farewell, as they depart to live with Vaughn. George returns to the camp and sets off to hunt the panther. He shoots it, but the panther leaps at him from behind, fatally wounding him, and he manages to kill it with a hunting knife before dying. The Sheriff returns to the Pemberton cabin with George's body. Serena, having expected George to return, grows upset and does not go to identify his body. As the Sheriff leaves, Serena lies on the bed, and picks up a lighter. After staring at it for a few moments, she throws the lighter onto the floor and stays in the cabin as it burns.

Life Manuel Moreno Barranco was born on 24 April 1932 in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, to Manuel Moreno and Mar√≠a Luisa Barranco. In August 1936 his father, persecuted by Falangists, left his home and fled to the Republican zone: after some days, there were rumours that he had been executed along with other Republicans at the sierra of Ronda, presumably on their way to Malaga. Barranco studied Commerce and started working at the bank of Jerez at the age of sixteen. Fond of the adventure literature of his time, he collected novels by Emilio Salgari or J. Mallorqu√≠. In 1950 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which forced him to resign for over one year. His first literary efforts date from this time. Shortly thereafter, Barranco would finish a few short stories and a novella, which he presented to Editorial Aguilar in 1955. They would be published two years later under the title Revelaciones de un n√°ufrago (Revelations of a Castaway). Portrait of Manuel Moreno Barranco towards 1960. In October 1956, encouraged by the imminent publication of his book, Barranco requested a leave from the bank of Jerez and moved to Madrid, looking for a new job. His aim was to build a literary career, something he considered difficult to accomplish in his hometown.Lettre sur l'asphyxie culturelle de Jerez-1956 He eventually managed to find a position at the Banco Popular Espa√±ol. In Madrid he started a novel (Arcadia feliz) and resumed writing short stories. Revelaciones de un n√°ufrago was eventually published in 1957, receiving praise from several critics.L‚Äôun de ceux qui commencent, critique, 1957 Espa√±a Semanal 1957. In February 1959, Barranco requested a leave and moved to London, where he worked as an associate editor for the Embassy of Venezuela. Six months later, he travelled around Switzerland and Italy and arrived in Paris with a single pound in his pocket.Oscar Carrera- \\"Corazones de desierto: ‚ÄòArcadia Feliz‚Äô, de Manuel Moreno\\" . After an initial period of poverty and menial labour, he found a job at the Agricultural Bank of France and made friends among the Spanish exile community. When he finished his novel Arcadia feliz (Happy Arcade), Juan Goytisolo recommended its publication in Mexico. Although Barranco started a second novel, Bancarios (Bank Clerks), which remains unfinished, his main concern in the last years of his life seems to have been the publication of Arcadia feliz. The work was announced by an anti-Francoist publisher,Arcadia feliz, anunciada en M√©xico,1961 . which went bankrupt before it was released. In his Paris years he had a romance with one Suzanne Lacoste, whom he planned to marry. In October 1962 he went on a two-week holiday to Barcelona, where he was informed about a six-month course in Carlos Barral's publishing house. Excited by this proposal, he settled in Molins de Rei and resigned from the Agricultural Bank of France by letter. He allegedly spent two months attempting to join that course; disillusioned and penniless, he returned to Jerez on 24 November 1962. Barranco spent Christmas in his family house, getting back in touch with his friends in Jerez. As one of them recalls: > after his return to Jerez we met often and talked much. You could feel that > he was a communist in our conversations, he didn't say so but he didn't deny > it either. You shouldn't trigger malicious gossip back then. In those days > Grimau was arrested and almost killed when he was pushed from a window of > the General Security Department, just to wind up executed by shooting. > Francoist information services were aware of his affiliation and he was > under surveillance since he crossed the border.Testimonio de su amigo Jes√∫s > Gonz√°lez On 27 January 1963 the police inspected the family house, searching for a pirate radio; they found nothing. Feeling increasingly surveilled, Barranco hid his writing machine and his last writings in a friend's house. This friend reports: > he started writing political pamphlets and cautiously handed them out. One > of those leaflets fell into the police's hands. He realized he was > persecuted and he thought they could only prove his authorship with his > writing machine, which he brought, together with some writings, to my house > in order to hide them. At the end of January they entered his house and > couldn't find anything, but they wanted to prove that the writings were his. > I was going to get married in a few days--it seems all of his friends were > under surveillance.

There is no known judiciary mandate, nor was he charged with a formal accusation. Lawyers asked to take the case refused by claiming that it was a \\"matter of jurisdictional competence\\". While Barranco was in jail, some police officers used to visit his mother to threaten her.Amenazas policiales a la madre de Manuel Moreno Ten days after his arrest, the family was informed that Barranco had \\"jumped from the prison balustrade\\", resulting in serious injury. He was admitted to the hospital of Santa Ana, where he died of a cerebral haemorrhage. Local newspaper Ayer reported the next day that Barranco had fallen from the balustrade, making no mention of his incarceration. The official version was the same as the one offered three months later regarding Juli√°n Grimau: suicide. The then Tourism and Information Minister, Manuel Fraga Iribarne, defended the government version in a letter to Jos√© Manuel Caballero Bonald, who had signed a manifesto to force the authorities to investigate the incident. > When the warder opened, as usual, the cell occupied by Mr Moreno Barranco, > at eight in the morning of February 22, the recluse jumped head first from > the balustrade of the corridor located in front of his cell and fell to the > yard, and the base of his skull was broken.Carta de Manuel Fraga Iribarne a > Jos√© Manuel Caballero Bonald The other prisoners reportedly did not witness the \\"suicide\\". The only witness was the police in charge of the interrogation, who claimed that he was there to inform Barranco of his transfer to Madrid.El polic√≠a que s√≠ estaba all√≠ The case shows many similarities with the defenestration of Julian Grimau,Tortura y defenestraci√≥n de Juli√°n Grimau as well as with four police defenestrations suffered by inmates between 1963 and 1969, none of which was admitted by the authorities.Cuatro defenestraciones policiales The police prevented his mother from seeing her dying son, and were present at his funeral,La polic√≠a impide a la madre ver al hijo agonizante discouraging his own friends from attending.Los amigos no fueron al entierro Many dubious rumours spread about the reasons of his arrest, for example that he was involved in some anti- Francoist conspiracy and that he found his missing father in Paris. Legacy Protest in Paris in 1963 against the murder of Juli√°n Grimau, Manuel Moreno Barranco, Francisco Granados and Joaqu√≠n Delgado. Barranco's death was reported in different parts of the world, often stressing the strange circumstances that surrounded it. Clandestine media within Spain/ \\"Bolet√≠n clandestino Unidad- Jerez, February 1964 and in the exile also mentioned it.Bolet√≠n de la Oficina de Prensa de Euzkadi en el exilio, 1 April 1963 In France a committee called \\"Union of Writers on Behalf of the Truth\\" was formed to cast light on the facts.News in Le Figaro, 22 June 1963 Some major newspapers in France,News in L¬¥Express, 16 May 1963 England,News in The Guardian, 23 October 1963 MexicoNews in Comunidad Ib√©rica, M√©xico,1963 and the United States published the news or demanded an explanation.

His work encompasses drawing, printmaking, sculpture, assemblage, and archival research, often having to do with the iconography of marginalized social and political groups and the American frontier. Helms's work has been exhibited at the New Museum of Contemporary Art (New York), MoMA PS1 (New York), the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York), Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), and Museum of Contemporary Art Denver (Denver). He is the recipient of the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award and the Rema Hort Mann Foundation Visual Art Grant Award, and has been an artist in residence at the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas.  Work  Adam Helms, \\"Untitled (48 Portraits, 2010),\\" 2010, charcoal on paper (view of installation at Marianne Boesky Gallery). Helms's work focuses on the iconography of marginalized political and social groups, and employs imagery from a range of sources: pixilated JPEGs of Chechen rebels, tintype portraits of Confederate and Union soldiers, photographs of black metal bands. Helms mines online archives and popular print material to trace connections between the uniforms, heraldry, and physical affectations of these groups, which are often the primary means of distinguishing between them. In his work, Helms explores how these persistent, unnervingly homogenous representations of violence and trauma are processed into visual artifacts. Helms's work has been exhibited widely and internationally, and is featured in Vitamin D2: New Perspectives in Drawing (Phaidon), among other publications. Helms is interested in visual archetypes that are employed in various historical periods, by diverse populations, in service of seemingly divergent ideological ends. ‚ÄúI think of myself as an ethnographer,‚Äù Helms says. ‚ÄúI am interested in the ethos of violence, the romanticization of extremist ideology, and linking issues from our political past with contemporary events.‚Äù Helms often depicts masked figures, using double-sided silkscreen portraits on vellum with faces obscured by pools of black ink resembling a balaclava or hood. One persistent touchstone is painter Gerhard Richter‚Äôs 48 Portraits (1971‚Äì72), which memorializes great writers, poets, and composers using images taken from an encyclopedia. Helms‚Äôs Untitled (48 Portraits, 2010) (2010) depicts anonymous militiamen and combatants‚Äîthe distortion of the original, online source images evident in the works‚Äîwho exist on the fringes of society and represent the shadow of the rational order on view in Richter‚Äôs work. Helms‚Äôs work takes the form of large-scale charcoal drawings depicting mythic landscapes (which evoke foundational and yet generic cultural narratives); screen prints and drawings on paper and other media; various installations; and light-box assemblages consisting of grid-like arrangements of archival images. These ‚Äúfields of comparison‚Äù suggest that ‚Äúrepresentations of the modern world‚Äôs extreme fringes‚Äîimages that we might imagine to break the mold of normal discourse‚Äîactually follow some of the most deeply ingrained conventions,‚Äù William S. Smith writes in a recent monograph on the artist's work. ‚ÄúHelms‚Äôs photographic archives reveal how cultures under duress consistently fall back on tropes and archetypes to find meaningful forms.‚Äù Recently Helms has moved away from overtly figurative work and has experimented with mounting various kinds of paper and felt to panels. These works often incorporate visual materials found in print publications and on the Internet, but they take the form of heralds invented by the artist‚Äîimagistic memes with a cryptic symbolism and uncanny quality. Helms considers the drawings on felt to be ‚Äúzombies‚Äù: emblems and visual identities that originally appeared in the 1960s‚Äì90s in advertisements in publications such as LIFE and Soldier of Fortune, often photojournalistic images of soldiers or portraits of women, and decontextualized and ‚Äúreanimated‚Äù by the artist. Helms's work is included in the collections of the Walker Art Center, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Caldic Collection, and the Dakis Joannou Collection.

Seruvakula, Bula Vakavanua, 2000, Ethnology (Fiji); Fijians (Social life and customs) chart of chiefly houses is a Tikina in Fiji's Tailevu Province. It is made up of several sub-districts or Tikina makawa, namely: Verata, Namalata, Tai, Vugalei, and Taivugalei. A Political Map of Eastern Viti Levu and adjacent islands, this image is the right half of an old Fiji Government map printed initially in 1953 by the Fiji Lands Department entitled \\"Viti Levu and Adjacent Islands - Colony of Fiji\\" Geography Verata, Namalata, Tai, and Vugalei have both coastal areas as well as extensive inland undulating and rugged terrain, while Taivugalei is completely landlocked and much further inland of/border Verata and Namalata. Shellfish, Fish, coconut, taro, tapioca and a range of local vegetables and seafoods are the main trading merchandise. Chiefly Title The traditional leader is the Na Bure Levu o Naisanokonoko, Nodra na Gone Turaga Bale, O Koya Na Ratu who traditionally is acknowledged as the most senior member of Fiji‚Äôs tribal hereditary chiefs.A History of Fiji, Ronald Albert Derrick, Published 1946, Government Press Suva, page 54 (Digitized from original by the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Digitized 23 Aug 2007) Fijian oral tradition holds that Fiji was settled by the legendary ancestral chief Lutunasobasoba. The first ‚ÄúNa Gone Turaga Bale O Koya Na Ratu‚Äù Rokomautu was said to be one of Lutunasobasoba‚Äôs sons. Verata shares this distinction with the vanua of Rewa (Burebasaga), Bureta, Batiki, and Kabara whose ancestral chiefs were the children of Lutunasobasoba. Most of the chiefly households on the Eastern half of Viti Levu as well all of Vanua Levu and Lau including Bau acknowledge either direct descent or some other strong connection to the vanua of Verata.A History of Fiji, Ronald Albert Derrick, Published 1946, Government Press Suva, page 53 (Digitized from original by the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Digitized 23 Aug 2007) History The sub-districts are in themselves separate Vanua with their own chiefs, but the Vanua of Verata used to cover a much wider area. In tribal Fiji, the power and therefore size of a vanua depended on the chief‚Äôs ability to hold the ‚Äúqali‚Äù or subject people, and to control the ‚Äúbati‚Äù or border people. Bati is usually translated as warrior because they often were, but the literal meaning of ‚Äúbati‚Äù in this sense is border (or edge). ‚ÄúVanua/Yavusa Qali-tu‚Äù or subject peoples/tribes often rendered service only as long as the paramount chief was strong enough to enforce his rule. It is difficult to say with any precision how far Verata influence reached but at its zenith it was the pre-eminent vanua of ancient Fiji.A History of Fiji, Ronald Albert Derrick, Published 1946, Government Press Suva, pages 23;53-4 (Digitized from original by the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Digitized 23 Aug 2007) It was eventually eclipsed by the rise of Bau and the changing face of tribal war with the arrival of beachcombers and marooned sailors like the well-known Charles Savage who came to serve Bau much to Verata‚Äôs disadvantage in 1808. In 1825, Bau had wrested from Verata, control of most of the island Ovalau including Levuka with the exception of Lovoni. Gau, Koro, Nairai and Batiki were soon to follow. By 1828, 20 years after the arrival of Savage, Ratu Naulivou (Vunivalu) had seized control of much of coastal eastern Viti Levu up to the delta of the Ba river. In 1829 Verata lost the allegiance of the powerful island and vanua of Viwa, who were to prove a vital role in the coming decades in the internecine conflicts. When Naulivou died later that year, he handed to his brother and successor Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa a powerful vanua whose only remaining rival was its closest ally the vanua of Rewa. With the loss of Viwa, Verata lost all hope of ever regaining supremacy and lost the majority of engagements with Bau after 1829;A History of Fiji, Ronald Albert Derrick, Published 1946, Government Press Suva, pages 22;44;45;49;54;55;58;62;75 (Digitized from original by the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Digitized 23 Aug 2007) Although, with the help of its own European, Matthew Riley, was able to hold onto what was left and even won a few skirmishes with the aid of various tactics and temporary alliances with Tui Cakau, Bau‚Äôs ally and erstwhile reluctant vassal (from 25 September 1840‚ÄìJuly 1841) and managed to attack Bau itself.A History of Fiji, Ronald Albert Derrick, Published 1946, Government Press Suva, page 79 (Digitized from original by the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Digitized 23 Aug 2007) Another notable example was the 26th of April 1850 when they soundly rebuffed an attempted Bauan raid in which the notorious Lasakau chief Ratu Gavidi was shot in the back and killed.A History of Fiji, Ronald Albert Derrick, Published 1946, Government Press Suva, page 103 (Digitized from original by the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Digitized 23 Aug 2007) Riley was given one of the chief‚Äôs daughters and the island of Naigani in thanks and the island was settled by Riley, his young family and several families to serve as retainers to the young Adi and her children. Infrastructure and Development Public infrastructure is less developed than in other districts in Fiji. The district is joined to other provinces by the Kings Road, one of the country's main highways, which recently has been tar-sealed for most of its length. As with most rural development, projects are generally carried out on a communal basis with finance sourced from central and provincial government, aid donors and the people themselves locally as well as remittances from urban areas and those working abroad. Examples of projects are village pipe water system, power generation, village toilets and septic tanks, village meeting halls, nursing and health stations, schools and pre-school facilities. Many landowning units are interested in developing their land commercially and whilst there are many options, capital is scarce.

The genus was described from a series of isolated fossil leaves in shale from an early Eocene location in southern British Columbia. History and classification Stonebergia has been identified from a location, the type locality, at the \\"One mile Creek\\" exposure of the Allenby Formation near Princeton, British Columbia. The Allenby Formation is currently considered to be Early Eocene in age, based on potassium‚Äìargon radiometric dating of plagioclase and biotite crystals. The Allenby formation sediments are interpreted as preserved river lake and wetlands systems, with a surrounding mountain environment. The species was described from a type specimen, the holotype specimen UWBM 54110 A,B and group of eight paratypes, five of which are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, in Seattle, Washington. Another one of the paratypes is placed in the princetone Museum and District Archives and the remaining two paratypes are in the University of Alberta collections. The specimens were studied by the paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Wesley C. Wehr of the Burke Museum. They published their 1988 type description for S. columbiana in the Journal Aliso. In their type description they note the etymology for the generic name Stonebergia is in honor of Margaret Stoneberg from the Princeton District Museum for her support and encouragement of Wolfe and Wehr. The specific epithet columbiana, is a reference to the type locality in British Columbia. Description The leaves of Stonebergia are simple and pinnately veined ranging between long and wide. The leaf lamina is notably pinnatifid with some areas almost being a compound leaf structure. The leaves have between four and nine pairs of secondary veins branching from the main vein at angles up to 90¬∞ near the base and decreasing to around 45¬∞ near the leaf tip. Each side of the secondary veins host up to seven lobes of the lamina and each lobe has up to eight total teeth. The petiole ranges between long and is notably very hairy. It bears a stipule up to half the petiole length which hosts many simple straight hairs in addition to some glandular hairs.

The date of the composition may probably be referred to the commencement of the last century... The song is popular all over the country, and there are numerous printed copies, ancient and modern.\\" Frank Kidson the English musicologist and folk song collector wrote in 1891, \\"Even now, the popularity of 'The Farmer's Boy' is great among country singers\\". Although he said that there was little variation in the text, he included three melodies and a fourth in an appendix, none of which is the most widely known one today.Kidson, Frank, Traditional Tunes, Chas Taphouse and Son, Oxford 1891 (pp.63-66 and p.174) The Baptist Church at Little Leigh where Thomas Fownes Smith preached.

Smith was the minister at Little Leigh Baptist Chapel for more than 30 years, where a plaque in his memory is located on the inside rear wall.Little Leigh Baptist Church - The Farmers Boy It is one of three folk songs traditionally sung by participants ahead of the Haxey Hood, a traditional mob football game held annually in North Lincolnshire at Epiphany = Tune = The tune most commonly associated with \\"The Farmer's Boy\\" comes from \\"Ye Sons of Albion\\", a patriotic song from the Napoleonic Wars.Mainly Norfolk: English Folk and Other Good Music - The Farmer's Boy That particular tune and song were first noted in 1909 in Oxfordshire by Janet Blunt of Adderbury Manor. It is this melody that has been arranged as a regimental march for the Royal Canadian Medical Service, a number of Commonwealth regiments including the Princess of Wales's Royal RegimentJack Kopstein, World Book Of Military Music and Musicians, Marches: E-F-G and the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment. = Field Recordings = In 1908, the famous composer and folk song collector Percy Grainger made a phonograph recording of a Mr. Tandy of Winchcombe, Gloucestershire singing a fragment of the song, which can be heard on the British Library Sound Archive website. Mark Anderson of Middleton-in-Teasdale, County Durham, the original source of the famous Scarborough Fair melody, sang the song to Alan Lomax in 1951, the recording of which is available online via the Alan Lomax archive. Peter Kennedy (1953) and Alan Lomax (1954) recorded Jags Plough of Barrow-on-Humber, Lincolnshire singing the song. Folk song collector Ken Stubbs recorded several versions in the 1960s and 70s in Sussex, Surrey and Cornwall, including one by the Sussex singer Pop Maynard, all of which can be heard on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website. The traditional singers Walter Pardon of Knapton, Norfolk (1985) and Fred Jordan of Ludlow, Shropshire (1990/91) were recorded singing versions of the song.

The mill was built for the Seminary of Quebec under the auspices of Bishop Fran√ßois de Laval. Construction began in 1691 and was completed by 1695. At various times in its more than 300-year history, the mill has been used to grind wheat, mill lumber, and cord wool. It was damaged or destroyed by fire three times, and has not been operational since the early twentieth century. The mill currently serves as a cultural and historical landmark in Quebec. History Moulin du Petit-Pr√©, 1927 by Edgar Gari√©py =Under French control= The mill was constructed between 1691 and 1695 by Charles Pouliot, and was used to grind wheat into flour for local merchants in the Quebec City area, deriving its power from the Petit-Pr√© river near where it joins the St. Lawrence river. Jean Richard was the mill's first miller. A fire in 1702 damaged the building, but it was repaired four years later, restoring the original milling capacity. Several repairs and improvements were made to the mill between 1732 and 1744, including the expansion of the building in 1742 to accommodate a third feed mill. In 1759, the mill and other structures along the Beaupr√© coast were burned by the British General James Wolfe's soldiers during the Siege of Quebec. The Jesuits rebuilt the mill over the next five years, including installing two new feed mills. Much of the repair cost was paid for by Antoine Nadeau who had leased the mill since 1757. =Under Canadian control= In 1778 a third feed mill was installed by the seminary. In 1810, Charles B√©langer obtained permission from the seminary to add a saw mill to the structure. Construction of the saw mill was completed in 1819. Several years after Quebec abandoned the seigneurial system, the mill was adapted for the additional function of carding wool by Joseph Joseph Cot√©. In 1871, the seminary sold the combined saw mill, flour mill and carding mill to George Benson Hall. Fire again destroyed the mill six years later and is immediately rebuilt with an updated turbine to replace the antiquated water wheel. In 1877 the mill is sold to Richard Temblay, who in 1889, gives it to his son, Richard. In 1897, the mill is again sold, this time to Zo√© Richard (n√©e Turgeon). Her daughter in turn inherited the mill in January 1925. =Modern history= In 1944, Ch√¢teau-Richer Cooperative assumed ownership of the mill until it was purchase by Pierre Jobidon in 1965. A year later, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs purchased the mill. In the 1970s, archaeological excavation aided in the partial restoration of the mill to its appearance around the time of its original construction. Ultimately, the mill restored to its appearance in 1763. In 1982, the mill housed a few municipal government offices as well as the Ministry of Cultural Affairs cultural center. Ownership again transferred in 1995, to Gestion Promiel Inc. de Ch√¢teau-Richer. In 2002, additional restoration work was undertaken by the Corporation pour la mise en valeur du Moulin du Petit Pr√©, restoring the mill to its current state. Current use Since 2003, the mill has served as a small cultural history museum and is open to visitors. The center has a bistro, reception hall and hosts various community cultural events.

Of the nineteen victims, eighteen were ethnic Serbs, and one was a Hungarian national. The ages of the victims, eight women and eleven men, ranged from 41 to 85. Two former Croatian soldiers were convicted for their role in the killings and were sentenced to 15 and 11 years, respectively. In November 2010, Croatian President Ivo Josipoviƒá laid a wreath at the graveyard of the massacre victims and officially apologized for the killings. Background In 1990, following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia by the pro-independence Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), relations between ethnic Croats and Croatian Serbs deteriorated. In August 1990, an insurrection took place in Croatia centred in predominantly Serb-populated areas of the country. These Serb-inhabited areas were subsequently named SAO Krajina. After the Krajina declared its intention to integrate with Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared it to be a rebellion. This conflict escalated into the Croatian War of Independence by March 1991. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month moratorium followed, after which the decision came into effect on 8 October. The village of Paulin Dvor had a population of 168 prior to the war, 147 of whom were ethnic Serbs. The inhabitants of the village were known to support Croatian authorities in Zagreb. Massacre On the night of 11 December 1991, Croatian troops entered the village. Nineteen people, eighteen Serbs and one Hungarian national, were detained in the house of a local man called Andrija Bukviƒá. Most of the village's 168 residents had already fled. The nineteen victims were detained because they were non-Croats. According to police investigators, the troops became enraged after a Croatian soldier was killed by a Serb sniper in a nearby village. Ten Croatian soldiers are said to have burst into the Bukviƒá house and murdered all of the detained individuals before destroying the home. The victims died of gunshot wounds and of injuries caused by the hand grenades that were hurled at them. Seventeen bodies were subsequently moved from the site of the killings. Only the body of Dara Vujanoviƒá, whose scalp had been removed, was left behind. The ages of the victims, eight women and eleven men, ranged from 41 to 85. Aftermath Croatian President Ivo Josipoviƒá apologized for the massacre in November 2010. The victims of the massacre were first buried near a military warehouse in Lug, near the town of ƒåepin. The village of Paulin Dvor and its surroundings were seized by Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) units and Serb paramilitaries soon afterwards. The area remained outside of Croatian control until it was peacefully reintegrated into the country in January 1998. The remains of the massacred villagers were relocated to the village of Rizvanu≈°a near Gospiƒá in 1997 and remained there until 13 May 2002, when they were exhumed by investigators from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In 2005, the Croatian Supreme Court sentenced Nikola Ivankoviƒá, a former soldier who served in the Croatian Army's 130th Brigade, to fifteen years in prison, while in May 2012 the District Court in the town of Osijek sentenced former Croatian soldier Enes Viteskoviƒá to eleven years in prison for his role in the deaths of eighteen people. In November 2010, Croatian President Ivo Josipoviƒá laid a wreath at the graveyard of the massacre victims. He said, \\"those who are left behind those victims deserve our apology\\" and stated that \\"a crime has no justification; revenge cannot be justified by a crime.\\" The wreath-laying ceremony came just after Serbian President Boris Tadiƒá's visit to Vukovar to commemorate the Croatian victims of the 1991 Vukovar massacre. Part of the Croatian public saw the two visits as key to the reconciliation process, while another part condemned Josipoviƒá's comments as an attempt to belittle the Vukovar massacre and an attempt to \\"relativize the guilt for crimes committed during the war.\\" NotesReferences ;Books  * ;Court documents * ;Journals * ;Websites     * 1991 in Croatia Mass murder in 1991 Croatian war crimes in the Croatian War of Independence Massacres in Croatia History of the Serbs of Croatia Massacres of Serbs December 1991 events in Europe 1991 crimes in Croatia 1991 murders in Europe 1990s murders in Croatia ","title":"Paulin Dvor massacre"},{"id":"38617898","text":"Timothy Woodbridge (February 27, 1709 ‚Äì May 10, 1774)Mitchell, p. 32. was an American missionary, deacon and schoolteacher, later a judge, representative, and Superintendent of Indian Affairs, from Springfield, Massachusetts, who spent most of his adult life in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, teaching the Mahicans and other Native Americans to read and write, English customs and the Christian religion. About him, Jonathan Edwards said, \\"By his long-proved justice and integrity, he has gained a vast esteem with the Indians\\".Marsden, pp. 398‚Äì399. Reverend John Sergeant described his efforts in this way: \\"Mr. Woodbridge ... has a very numerous school and a tedious task of it; lives a very lonesome life; is indeed indefatigable in his business; and no body deserves more of the publick than he.\\"Hopkins, p. 51. Gideon Hawley called him \\"a man of abilities... always poor, and had a powerful party against him; but he rose to be the first man in the county.\\"Marsden, p. 103. Timothy worked very closely with all three men. He was instrumental in the purchase of large tracts of land in western New England from the Native Americans, such as modern-day Lenox and Alford, Massachusetts, by parlaying this reputation and experience.  Early life  Timothy Woodbridge was born on February 27, 1709 to Reverend John Woodbridge VIII and Jemima Eliot. His father, the first minister of West Springfield, Massachusetts,Mitchell, p. 20. was the eighth generation of ministers by the name John Woodbridge, including John Woodbridge V and John Woodbridge VI, and his brother was the ninth. His mother was the granddaughter of John Eliot, the \\"Apostle to the Indians\\". His brother Benjamin was also a minister, and the town of Woodbridge, Connecticut is named in his honor. Timothy's father died young, when a tree fell on him in 1718.Mitchell, p. 20. John left Timothy one fifth of his land in the town of Wethersfield, Connecticut in his will.Manwaring, Charles Williams. A Digest of the Early Connecticut Probate Records: Hartford district, 1700-1792, Peck & Company, printers, 1904, p. 454.  Missionary life = Early years = John Sergeant had arranged to return to Yale to complete his duties as a tutor, so the ministers associated with the mission sought Timothy out as an ideal candidate, due to his education, family history, and possibly, knowledge of their language.Frazier, p. 23. Sergeant himself called Timothy \\"a young gentleman very well qualify'd for the business\\".Hopkins, p. 27. At this time, there were about forty or fifty Mahicans settled at the mission, and little more than twenty children attended the school. Timothy arrived the last week of November, 1734, while Sergeant was away at Albany, meeting with the Mohawks, and the mission was left in his hands when Sergeant returned to New Haven on December 9. As schoolmaster, he taught reading and writing of English, cleanliness, English manners, and Christian morals.Edwards, p. clxxxiv. On January 19, 1735, a council with Mahican leadership was held, and they voiced their desire that Timothy would remain with them, and that John Sergeant would return to live among them.Hopkins, p. 22. However, not all of the Mahicans agreed that they should submit to the English lifestyle, and rumors circulated that there was resentment about Chief Konkapot and Umpachenee being given military commissions by Governor Jonathan Belcher, as well as the mission in general. Soon after the council, several of the locals, including Lieutenant Umpachenee's family, fell seriously ill, and they were convinced they had been poisoned by their discontented brethren. They asked that Timothy pray for them, and that they be given a Christian burial, if they should die, which two individuals did. A few weeks later, determined to discover the perpetrator, the spiritual leaders held a type of divination ceremony. When Timothy learned of this, he set out to observe the ceremony, arriving just in time. After the ceremony, he voiced his great displeasure of their \\"sinful\\" method of worship, and they agreed never to repeat the mistake.Frazier, pp. 29-31. In February, the Mahicans went into the woods to harvest maple syrup for their annual supply of sugar. Timothy took this opportunity to return to Springfield to visit friends and relatives, returning in early spring.Hopkins, p. 26. Sergeant returned for a short time, and they took turns at the two Mahican settlements. When Sergeant returned to Yale again, he wrote Dr. Colman, one of the Commissioners of Indian Affairs at Boston, and requested that Timothy would be compensated so that he might continue there, being that there was enough work for two missionaries. Sergeant returned to stay in early July, and they resumed trading places on a weekly basis. In August, Timothy fell ill with a form of malaria.Frazier, p. 32. When he felt well enough to travel, he returned to Springfield, only to relapse, delaying his return until November. During the winter of 1736, Sergeant and Woodbridge decided to accompany the Mahicans on their maple syrup harvest, so that their education could continue, uninterrupted. = Indian Town = On March 25, the General Court granted a township on the Housatonic River, which would become Stockbridge, to the Mahicans, so that they could all live in one place, facilitating their education. Sergeant and Woodbridge each were to be granted 1/16th of the land, although Timothy lodged with Captain Konkapot that spring.Taylor, p. 64. At this time, the population increased to about ninety individuals.Brown, Raymond H. The Housatonic Indians, Massachusetts Archaeological Society, April 1958, p. 48. The Woodbridges had built a house, the first permanent residence in the township, by January 1737, and John Sergeant lodged with them at this time, to live among his congregation. On May 7, the town, then known only as \\"Indian Town\\", was confirmed to the Mahicans, and funding was granted for a schoolhouse and meeting house to be constructed in August, with Timothy appointed to the supervising committee.Hopkins, p. 59. In 1737, Timothy and Abigail served as witnesses to a land deal between Colonel John Stoddard and the Native Americans, comprising the modern town of Pittsfield.Learning, p. 282. Timothy would be involved with many more purchases and land swaps in the coming years. During the winter of 1738-39, Sergeant and Woodbridge worked to create a passable road from New Glasgow, greatly increasing the accessibility of their town.Perry, Arthur Latham. Origins in Williamstown, C. Scribner's Sons, 1894,p. 304. Timothy was the senior deacon of the church, and identified as a New Light regarding the contemporary Great Awakening (he would later help recruit Jonathan Edwards, and become his greatest ally in Stockbridge). = Stockbridge formed = On June 22, 1739, the town of Stockbridge was incorporated, and the Rev. Arthur Lawrence, a Stockbridge historian, found it very probable that Timothy was responsible for the name, as the Woodbridges had come from a neighboring town of Stockbridge, Hampshire.Learning, p. 575. Due to its new status, town officers had to be elected, and Timothy was chosen for town clerk. One of the conditions of the grant was that four new English families be allowed to settle there, and Timothy's brother Joseph, who became an important citizen, soon joined him.Field, David Dudley. An Historical sketch of the Congregational Church, Stockbridge,Congregational Church (Stockbridge, Mass.), 1888, p. 8. This same year, Timothy was involved in a land swap with the Indians, trading 280 acres of riverfront land in Stockbridge for some 4000 acres in what is now the city of Lenox, his part of which was 480 acres.Frazier, p. 48. In 1743, the Mahicans wrote to Governor Shirley, asking that lands be confirmed to Timothy and Ephraim Williams, Jr., and the next year, Timothy sold some of his land granted by the General Court to Ephraim, Sr. 1749 was a tumultuous year for Timothy and Stockbridge. The Mahicans had many complaints, including that Timothy had illegally purchased a tract of land without the consent of the entire tribe, so a committee was sent to investigate. Despite the fact that the sale was confirmed to be illegal, it was decided he should keep the land.Frazier, p. 84. John Sergeant's death in July left the town without a resident minister for over two years, and began a feud for control of the town between the Woodbridges and Williamses. = Interim = Timothy was again elected as town clerk in 1749, and effectively oversaw the mission during the search for a replacement minister.Taylor, p. 33. At this time his school had an enrollment of 55 students, and his salary was about 87 pounds for six months of teaching.Hopkins, p. iv.Frazier, p. 104. In November and December, Timothy had several real estate dealings, including a bargain with Konkapot and Umpachene, a petition to Spencer Phips that lands be confirmed, in exchange for a loan he had made to the Mahicans in 1740, and a statement regarding lands he had been granted previously.Various. Stockbridge Papers, Cornell University Rare and Manuscripts Collections In April 1750, Timothy and others made a request of Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet, governor of New Hampshire, for a grant of a township.Williams, Ephraim. 1750 April 6, Richard Henry Winslow Dwight Collection, Volume 50, 1744-1911, Williams College. In the winter of 1750-51, a number of Mohawks, including Chief Hendrick and Chief Nicholas, relocated to Stockbridge, increasing their population to about ninety.Edwards, p. clxxi. = Jonathan Edwards years = Despite the maneuvering of the Williams family, Jonathan Edwards became the successor to John Sergeant and became the resident minister on August 9, 1751.Learning, p. 87. Timothy, as clerk, wrote up a land deed for Edwards the following April. A man named John Wauwaumpequunnaunt served as translator for Edwards, and also assisted Timothy in his school, and Edwards lobbied that he be compensated more generously.Marsden, p. 393.  Feud for control  Management of the boarding school was an ongoing source of contention in Stockbridge. Martin Kellogg had been leading the school, to which Edwards and Woodbridge objected. They requested that a new teacher be sent, and Gideon Hawley arrived in February 1752 to teach the Mohawks and Oneidas (the resident Mahicans were still taught at Woodbridge's school). However, Kellogg was supported by the Williamses and Joseph Dwight, and so refused to abandon his post, resulting in a battle for control.Frazier, p. 101. In April, Timothy and other supporters of Edwards met to encourage the few remaining students' families that they should remove their children from Kellogg's classes.Marsden, p. 399. In response, Dwight presented a report to the General Court, stating that Kellogg's methods had been working well, until Edwards and Woodbridge interfered, and tried to get Edwards removed as minister. A rare point of agreement between the two camps was that the ginseng craze was drawing many of the Mohawks away. Timothy had been elected to the General Court, and so was able to refute this testimony, as well as to inform Edwards of the proceedings.Marsden, p. 583. This feud continued through Edwards' stay in Stockbridge. In addition to being elected as a representative, Timothy, by then known to the Native Americans as Solohkuwauneh, was made a Justice of the Peace in 1752, at the recommendation of Edwards.Frazier, p. 103. Timothy later made a judge of both probate and of Common Pleas, in 1761. Unfortunately, his historic docket was later destroyed by a fire in 1846.Jones, p. 135. On January 3, 1753, Timothy was appointed as guardian of the Mohawk children at the boarding school.General Court House of Representatives, p. 14. In February, the boarding school mysteriously burnt down, and Hawley lost everything. It was widely believed that the Williams/Dwight/Kellogg faction had set the fire, although this was never proven. As a result, it was decided that Hawley might be more successful if he lived among the Mohawks, instead of having them come to him. So, on May 22, 1753, Timothy and Gideon took a trip to Onaquaga, in Iroquois territory.Marsden, pp. 403-4. The British were especially motivated to establish a relationship with the Six Nations as they foresaw the onset of the French and Indian War.  Rumors of an uprising  There was a near uprising in town when a man named Wampaumcorse, a Schaghticoke volunteer detective, was killed by white men after he approached them, regarding horses he believed they had stolen. The men were arrested, and one was found guilty of manslaughter, but this hardly satisfied the bereft family. Combined with harsh feelings resulting from the fallout of the Stockbridge feud, resentment increased to a fervor. Guns went missing and meetings with distant tribes were made. Some slaves revealed that they had been invited to partake in a massacre of the English. A town meeting was held, where it was made apparent that the conspirators were but a few, and the majority knew nothing of it, but the town remained on edge. The General Court voted to compensate the family six pounds, but the payment was delayed such that Timothy and Joseph Dwight wrote to Governor Shirley, asking that the sum be increased and the payment made promptly, to avoid retaliation. On April 2, 1754, the court increased the payment to 20 pounds. This, too, was delayed, and Edwards wrote to expedite the payment, and it was finally made, which mostly quelled the potential uprising, but left some harsh feelings.Learning, pp. 89-90.  Susquehanna Company and The Albany Congress  Timothy was voted into the Susquehanna Company, a company interested in purchasing a large tract of land in the Wyoming Valley of modern Pennsylvania, on January 9, 1754, and granted a free share in the company. They hoped his reputation and experience with Native Americans would ensure successful negotiations, and he has appointed an agent of the company, to actually negotiate the deal with the sachems.Egle, p. 14. In an effort to strengthen their relationship with the Iroquois Nation, the British organized the Albany Congress from June 19 to July 11, which Timothy attended, working behind the scenes to secure the Susquehanna purchase for Connecticut. However, this purchase was disputed, and Chief Hendrick gave the same land to Pennsylvania, which resulted in an ongoing dispute for many years.Marsden, p. 408.  French and Indian War  The British had an ulterior motive for much of their interaction with the Iroquois nation, that of trying to win their affiliation against France, their frequent adversary in the quest to control the North American continent. In late summer of 1754, before they were officially at war, France was encouraging certain tribes, such as the Schaghticokes, Onahgungoes, and Orondocks, to take revenge on the British for the wrongs that had been committed against them, and several attacks and murders were committed. In October, Timothy Woodbridge met with some of the Canadian chiefs, to try to determine the reason for their unprovoked attacks, when the two parent nations were at peace (albeit very tenuously). The following year, Timothy was listed as a lieutenant on a muster roll of Stockbridge, under Joseph Dwight.Learning, p. 94. At about the same time, Jonathan Edwards fell ill, and Dwight redoubled his efforts to regain control of the boarding school (and the funding that came with it). Timothy led a delegation of Stockbridge natives to Boston to testify to their support of both Edwards and himself. Israel Williams used his growing influence with Governor Shirley, against them.Marsden, p. 412. In fall of 1756, Timothy was again involved in a couple large land deals. In September, he was witness (as Justice of the Peace) to a deed of purchase of over 20,000 acres, including the modern town of Austerlitz, New York from the Stockbridges.Light, Sally. The Deed to Austerlitz, The Times of Old Austerlitz, Austerlitz Historical Society, Autumn 2010, pp. 1,3. About a month later, he was part of the group which made the Shawenon Purchase, which encompassed most of modern Alford, Massachusetts.Learning, pp. 586-7. In October 1757, Timothy wrote to Thomas Pownall, requesting legislation restricting the sale of alcohol to the Native Americans. Aaron Burr, Sr., the president of Princeton University, died at a young age on September 24, 1757. Jonathan Edwards was sought out as a potential replacement, but left the decision up to a council of ministers. Timothy pleaded to the council that Edwards should remain in Stockbridge to no avail, and Edwards soon left for Princeton, and died shortly thereafter.Marsden, pp. 430-431. Timothy was a witness to Edwards' will.Edwards, Jonathan. Jonathan Edwards' Last Will, March 14, 1758. = Later years = In November 1758, another petition was sent to Thomas Pownall, requesting that Timothy be allowed to purchase another 350 acres of the Stockbridges' land.Yokun, Jehoiakim, et al. Letter to Thomas Pownall, Cornell University, November 24, 1758. During these times, church attendance was often mandatory at a certain frequency, and tythingmen were charged with making sure that the families under their watch were attending. If one failed to attend, they were given a choice of paying a fine or spending a day in the stocks. Such was the case with a group of Dutchmen in Great Barrington. Timothy advised them to go the stockade route rather than pay a fine, and even went as far as accompanying them to Sheffield, to ensure they weren't treated badly, as was usually the case with the stockades.Taylor, pp. 185-187. Berkshire County was incorporated in spring of 1761, and Timothy Woodbridge was selected as an associate judge for the Court of Common Pleas. The very first meeting of the court was held at his house in July.Learning, p. 321. In January 1762, Timothy was the moderator for another meeting of the Susquehanna Company in Hartford, Connecticut, and was voted a member of the committee to prepare their case for King George III to confirm their purchase.Egle, p. 39. In April, he wrote a letter to Governor Francis Bernard requesting help in apprehending the murderer of a Stockbridge man named Cheneaquun in Albany.Woodbridge, Timothy. Letter to Governor Francis Bernard, Cornell University, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, April 20, 1762. In May, he was selected to a committee to \\"direct and inspect\\" the settlement of Susquehanna Company land.Egle, p. 43. In June, the General Court granted 1500 pounds to Timothy, to be distributed to the Stockbridges, for giving up their rights to disputed lands. This was augmented by another 200 pounds the following February. Timothy later supplied the court with a detailed listing of the distribution of this money.Secretary of the Commonwealth.Commonwealth of Massachusetts Senate Records, 16 May 1865. Timothy had again been elected to the legislature in 1762, but was not reelected the following year due to an election rigged by Elijah Williams. In November 1762, the Susquehanna Company voted him to be a part of a committee to meet with the Native American chiefs at Albany to discuss the purchase they had made, which was still disputed. This meeting was set for late March, and Elijah and his supporters took advantage of his absence. At this time, the number of English settlers had increased drastically, and some of them were in favor of splitting the town between the English and Native Americans. Williams called for a town meeting while Timothy was in Albany, and while many of the Native American voters were away on their winter syrup harvest. Timothy heard about this, but was apparently convinced his supporters would reelect him. Williams, however, brought in outsiders to vote for him and used a written ballot, as opposed to the past policy of translating everything into Mahican so that the Mahicans would understand. Even using these extreme tactics, Williams still only won by a three-vote margin. Timothy and his supporters were outraged and demanded an investigation. A petition was sent to Governor Bernard in May with 23 signatures, and Timothy sent another letter in December with 16 signatures. The investigation was delayed until October, and confirmed many of their charges, however the results were allowed to stand.Marsden, pp. 184-5. In April, Timothy was elected president of a committee to lay out eight townships within the Susquehanna purchase, and to determine the method of settling these eight, as well as two other towns. He was granted a salary of 20 pounds per month for six months for this task. In May, he was selected to represent the Massachusetts Bay Colony in selecting the settlers of these new townships.Egle, pp. 48,60. Due to a history of disputed and lopsided land sales, there were strict laws in place regarding the sale of lands by the Native Americans. This handcuffed them from being able to support themselves when they had no other means of generating income, such as in old age or to settle their debts. On this subject, Timothy lobbied the government during the winter of 1763-1764 and wrote to Andrew Oliver in November 1764, asking that they be allowed the same rights to sell their lands as the English.Marsden, p. 181. By this time, most citizens on both sides, including Timothy Woodbridge, were in favor of creating a separate township for the Native Americans and the Woodbridge family and friends. However, when the commissioners proposed that the English would then have to support their own school and church, without the mission funding, the proposal was almost universally opposed by the English.Marsden, p. 185. Timothy was again elected to the General Court in 1765.Lerning, p. 313. In October, he was granted oversight of sales for the Stockbridges, so that they could settle their debts and retain some of their more productive land that they had pawned. He could also supervise grant temporary leases for lands that they were not using.Marsden, p. 181. The same year, Timothy became involved with a grievance of the Wappinger tribe, regarding land claims in New York, and wrote to William Johnson on their behalf.Marsden, p. 169. In June 1766, Timothy issued a warrant for a meeting to elect officers, to form the town of Becket.Secretary of the Commonwealth, Acts and Resolves: 1765-66, State Library of Massachusetts, p. 817. By 1767, the English residents of Stockbridge were again working to create a separate township for themselves, behind Timothy's back.Marsden, p. 185. The following year, Timothy and his brother Joseph again tried to seek William Johnson's help in New York regarding land claims. The Stockbridges had to sell an additional 150 acres to pay their legal fees, and were again unsuccessful. Also in 1768, Timothy testified about the character of one of his former students, a man named Joseph Van Gelder, who was half European and half Native American.Misc Manuscripts V, filed under John Van Rensselaer, New York Historical Society, 1768. In 1769, Timothy was selected to a committee for collecting taxes from members of the Susquehanna Company, and was again elected to the General Court, serving from 1769-1771.Egle, p. 66. Timothy wrote to Eleazar Wheelock, founder of Dartmouth College, in March 1773, regarding the admission of three boys to Moor's Indian Charity School, which was a school for training Native Americans to be missionaries themselves.Woodbridge, Timothy. Letter to Rev. Wheelock, [Hanover, N.H.], 1773 In June, the Stockbridges petitioned that Timothy be allowed to sell as much as their land as was required, being that their tribe was greatly in debt, and some members imprisoned on those grounds. Their petition was again granted.General Court House of Representatives, p. 17. In December, Timothy wrote to Governor William Tryon, requesting compensation for those Stockbridge Native Americans who had fought for the British during the French and American War.Woodbridge, Timothy. Letter to William Tryon, Edward E. Ayer, Ayer Collection, 1911. Shortly before his death, Timothy was chosen a member of the Governor's Council by mandamus of King George III. However, with his loyalty lying with the colonies in the days preceding the Revolutionary War, he declined. Timothy died on May 10, 1774 and is buried in Stockbridge.  Family  Timothy married Abigail Day, a descendant of Robert Day, one of the founders of the Connecticut Colony, on November 23, 1736. When their daughter Abigail (the first European child born in the township) was born just over five months later, they each had to pay a fifty shilling fine after pleading guilty to \\"fornication before marriage\\".Frazier, p. 46. The Woodbridges had ten children and also had a slave servant couple with at least one child of their own.Marsden, p. 104. Their son Enoch Woodbridge fought in the American Revolution, was the first mayor of Vergennes, Vermont and a justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. Enoch's grandson was Frederick E. Woodbridge, who was a member of the United States House of Representatives.  See also  References  ;Notes ;Sources * Edwards, Jonathan; Rogers, Henry; and Dwight, Sereno Edwards.

They are influenced by hip-hop, funk, dub, reggae and jazz. Chinese Man is composed of DJ Marseille Z√© Mateo and High Ku and beatmaker SLY. Beatmakers Leo le Bug and Le Yan also revolve around the group and participate in the composition of several pieces. Frequent live additions to the crew include Taiwan MC and MC Youthstar. The group became known through the song \\"I've Got That Tune\\" which was chosen by Mercedes-Benz for its promotional campaign and by the French Film Festival in Hong Kong as its theme. Chinese Man Records label is based in Marseille, France. Controversy Chinese Man have received criticism for their name. The group is primarily composed of three Caucasian men, High Ku, Sly, and Z√© Mateo, and are frequently joined live onstage by Youthstar and ASM (Green T & FP). The audiovisual content for which they are well-known is produced by Fred&Annabelle;, and VYZ Team. The titular character for their music video \\"Miss Chang\\" is portrayed by Caucasian actress Cl√©mentine Baert. There were protests in Canada during their 2018 North American tour. The group has explained that Chinese Man is the name of the first track the collective produced together in 2004. The track got its name from a vocal sample saying Chinese Man, and they kept that name for the band and for the related label Chinese Man Records (aka CMR). According to the band, they also kept this name because the CMR collective express a keen general interest in Asian culture (visuals, books, movies, animation, history, etc.), and have publicly stated their intention to keep the name as a tribute to what they consider a deep, rich, and varied culture. Like other bands such as IAM in France and the Wu- Tang Clan in the US, the CMR collective have created a graphic universe around a mythical character.

It premiered in the United States on NBC on February 6, 2012. The series revolves around a fictional New York theater community making new Broadway musicals. In the first season, the focus was on the making of Bombshell, a musical based on the life of Marilyn Monroe. In the second season, the show was split between taking Bombshell to Broadway and the creation and mounting of a contemporary pop musical called Hit List that was about the price of fame. Other fictional musicals that were touched on for which original songs were performed include Beautiful and Liaisons. A few of the songs were written for events outside of the aforementioned musicals. Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman wrote all but one of the songs in the first season. In the second season, they wrote all of the songs outside of Hit List, along with several Hit List songs, as will be noted below. All their songs written for the show, except for a couple where only a few lines were written, can be found listed in the ASCAP music database. The other songwriters are noted and referenced where appropriate. The following list details the original songs featured in Smash. The 20th Century Fox Mambo \\"The 20th Century Fox Mambo\\" is an original song introduced in the second episode of the first season of the musical TV series Smash, entitled \\"The Callback\\". It was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, but in the show's universe, it was written by songwriting team Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) and Julia Houston (Debra Messing) for their Marilyn Monroe musical Bombshell. In the episode, Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) needs to give a dance audition for the producing team as part of trying to get the role of Marilyn in Bombshell. She works with director and choreographer Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) and then performs this song with the ensemble members in front of the producing team. The song is reprised several more times during the first season. It is performed by Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) in the fourth episode \\"The Cost of Art\\", by Karen and Ivy separately in the seventh episode \\"The Workshop, and by Karen in the fifteenth episode \\"Bombshell\\" for a preview show in Boston. In the second season, the song is reprised in the thirteenth episode \\"The Producers\\" by Ivy and the Bombshell ensemble, with a little assist from Kathie Lee Gifford in a cameo, for some musical theater children. The song, with McPhee's vocals, was originally released as a single on iTunes and Amazon.com's MP3 store and is available on the cast albums The Music of Smash and Bombshell. A Letter from Cecile \\"A Letter from Cecile\\" is an original song introduced in the sixth episode of the second season of the musical TV series Smash, entitled \\"The Fringe\\". It was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, but within the show's universe, it was written by an unnamed composer for the Liaisons musical that Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) is in. In the episode, Ivy is unhappy with the direction that the Liaisons production has taken now that star Terry Falls (Sean Hayes) has gone off his various medications and has turned the show into a trainwreck. With the press in attendance to get a preview of the show, she sings this song in an operatic and comedic way, stealing some of Terry's thunder. The song is available as a single. A Love Letter from the Times \\"A Love Letter from the Times\\" is an original song introduced in the tenth episode of the second season of the musical TV series Smash, entitled \\"The Surprise Party\\". It was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, but in the show's universe, it was written by Tom Levitt (Christian Borle). In the episode, Tom recruits Liza Minnelli (playing herself) to sing this song with him to Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) during their dinner together as a surprise for her birthday to make up for their fighting over him hiring her mother for Bombshell. The song is available as a single. A Thousand and One Nights \\"A Thousand and One Nights\\" is an original song introduced in the twelfth episode of the first season of the musical TV series Smash, entitled \\"Publicity\\". It was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, but in the episode, it is presented as a character's fantasy of a Bollywood musical number so the songwriter is unnamed. In the episode, Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) and her boyfriend Dev (Raza Jaffrey) are having a tense dinner with movie star Rebecca Duvall (Uma Thurman) at an Indian restaurant. Rebecca has taken over as the lead in the Marilyn Monroe musical Bombshell, while Karen is her understudy. However, Rebecca has taken Karen out for quite a bit of partying, which has caused tensions between Karen and Dev. During the meal, Rebecca and Dev start to argue about who is the one harming Karen. An uncomfortable Karen starts watching a Bollywood movie on one of the screens, and then imagines herself in a Bollywood-style movie with first Dev, then herself singing the song, with practically the entire rest of the main cast and various supporting players of the series performing as backup. The song is sung in the style of an Indian Bollywood song, with the performers dressed in Indian clothes. Arthur Miller Melody \\"Arthur Miller Melody\\" is an original song introduced in the ninth episode of the first season of the musical TV series Smash, entitled \\"Hell on Earth\\". It was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. In the show's universe it was written by songwriters Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) for their Bombshell musical about Marilyn Monroe. In the episode, Julia's husband Frank (Brian d'Arcy James) is rummaging around his wife's nightstand looking for something and comes across the sheet music. Something about it catches his eye. Julia later comes home and Frank is at the piano with the sheet music and quietly playing and singing a little bit of the song (\\"Arthur Miller Melody\\" is written at the top of the sheet music). He stops and asks her about it, saying the lyrics about Marilyn on the Brooklyn Bridge sound a little strange, voicing his suspicion that Julia is having an affair and the lyrics are really about that. Julia breaks down and admits that she was having an affair, but it is over. By season two, the song has developed into a solo sung by Arthur Miller, entitled \\"The Right Regrets\\". It was performed by Tom and Julia in Episode 15, The Transfer. The song is available on the cast album Bombshell. At Your Feet \\"At Your Feet\\" is an original song introduced in the fourteenth episode of the second season of the musical TV series Smash, entitled \\"The Phenomenon\\". It was written by the show's in-house songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, but in the show's universe, it was written by songwriting team Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) and Julia Houston (Debra Messing) for their Marilyn Monroe musical Bombshell. In the episode, we get a short segment of the song, with Leigh Conroy (Bernadette Peters) as Marilyn Monroe's mom Gladys taking young Marilyn (Sophia Anne Caruso) to Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the two perform the song. Earlier, Tom had indicated to Kyle Bishop (Andy Mientus) that Marilyn's mom had left her at the theater and so it was a sad moment, but Kyle suggests that maybe they make the number a happy one, changing what really happened in Marilyn's life to something that was more fantasy. After Kyle's death, we see the number performed during a Bombshell show as more of a happy fantasy than the sad way it was done previously. The song is available on the cast album Bombshell. Big Finish \\"Big Finish\\" is an original song introduced in the seventeenth episode of the second season of the musical TV series Smash, entitled \\"The Tonys\\". The song is written by the show's in-house songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, but in the show's universe, it was written by songwriting team Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) and Julia Houston (Debra Messing) for a performance at the Tony Awards. In the episode, Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) and Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) perform this number with male dancers at the Tony Awards. The song is available on the cast album Smash: The Complete Season 2 available digitally. Broadway, Here I Come! \\"Broadway, Here I Come!\\" is an original song introduced in the first episode of the second season of the musical TV series Smash, entitled \\"On Broadway\\". It was written by Joe Iconis. Within the show's universe, it was written by the songwriting team Jimmy Collins (Jeremy Jordan) and Kyle Bishop (Andy Mientus) for their Hit List musical. In the episode, the setting has Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), having previously become acquainted with Jimmy and Kyle in a bar they work in, finds out from Kyle they are a songwriting team working on a musical. Karen overhears Jimmy singing the song on a piano and then moves closer to watch him perform it. During the song, she dials Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) to have him listen and tells him this may be the next thing they are looking for as the Bombshell musical they were working on has temporarily shut down. Karen reprises the song in the ninth episode of the second season, entitled \\"The Parents\\", at a rehearsal for a benefit (though she is interrupted by Derek before finishing) and then at the benefit, where she is heard singing the last few bars. Ana Vargas (Krysta Rodriguez) reprises part of the song in the eleventh episode of Season 2, entitled \\"The Dress Rehearsal\\", as part of rehearsing for a new opening for Hit List.

The song is performed by Marilyn Monroe's \\"shadow selves\\", the voices that she hears inside her head (which are given much larger roles so the movie star but bad singer Rebecca Duvall doesn't have to sing as many songs). Although the song is originally meant for Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) plots against her by making Ellis (Jaime Cepero) send her an anonymous text, telling her that she is no longer needed in rehearsals, even though she is actually required to sing the song. With little time to waste, director and choreographer Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) gives the song to Ivy. The song is sung in the rehearsal room (the introduction being Monroe lying on a therapist's chair while the therapist is asking her to remember her mother), and as the chair is pushed aside, a movable plank of wood that Ivy is standing on is moved centre stage. The song \\"bleeds over a montage of domestic activity featuring 'Smash' characters\\". As soon as Ivy finishes the song, Duvall says that Marilyn (i.e. herself) should sing it. A reprise of the song is performed in the fourteenth episode \\"Previews\\" as the second last musical number of Bombshell (the last, until Don't Forget Me was written), and is performed by Duvall as Monroe as she lies on her bed, dying. The song (with Hilty's vocals) was initially released as a single from iTunes and Amazon.com's MP3 store and is available on the cast album Bombshell. Smash! \\"Smash!\\" is an original song introduced in the fourteenth episode of the first season of the musical TV series Smash, entitled Previews. It was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, but in the show's universe, it was written by the songwriting team of Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) and Julia Huston (Debra Messing) for their musical Heaven on Earth and then reworked for Bombshell, the Marilyn Monroe musical they are working on. In the episode, Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) and Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) and the female members of the ensemble perform the song with the actor playing studio head Darryl F. Zanuck (Marc Kudisch) during a Boston preview of Bombshell. The song is available on the cast album Bombshell. They Just Keep Moving the Line \\"They Just Keep Moving the Line\\" is an original song introduced in the second episode of the second season of the musical TV series Smash, entitled \\"The Fallout\\". It was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. Within the show's fictional setting, it was written by the songwriting team Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) and Julia Houston (Debra Messing) for the Bombshell musical they are working on about Marilyn Monroe. In the episode, the setting has Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) performing the song during a theater wing benefit that Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), Derek Wills (Jack Davenport), Ivy, Tom, and Julia have crashed. Tom and Julia convince Ivy to perform the song to impress the audience in order to entice possible investors. The song is also partially performed by Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) in the third episode of the second season, \\"The Dramaturg\\", as Derek works with Karen and the Bombshell ensemble to rehearse the number and figure out the choreography. We also see a partial reprise of the song by Ivy in the same episode, depicted as video playback of a previous rehearsal of the number by Ivy that Tom Levitt is watching. The song, with Hilty's vocals, is available on the cast album Bombshell. =Critical reception= Noel Murray of AVClub.com said of the song in her review of \\"The Fallout\\" episode, \\"And right at the end of the almost irredeemable ‚ÄúThe Fallout,‚Äù Ivy rouses the American Theater Wing crowd with ‚Äú(They Just Keep) Moving The Line,‚Äù a Bombshell song about resurrection that‚Äôs so electrifying that I actually muttered ‚Äúdamn‚Äù to myself when it was over (and adjusted my grade accordingly).\\" Three On a Match \\"Three On a Match\\" is an original song performed in the tenth episode of the first season of Smash, entitled \\"Understudy\\". It was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. In the show's universe, it was written by the songwriting duo Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) and Julia Houston (Debra Messing) for their very first musical Three On a Match. In the episode, as part of their celebration of the tenth anniversary of their work partnership, Tom and Julia find a high school production of the musical and watch it from the audience. Only the last few bars of the song are performed. It is unknown if the song exists in full and it has not yet been released for purchase. Touch Me \\"Touch Me\\" is an original song introduced in the eighth episode of the first season of the musical TV series Smash, entitled \\"The Coup\\". It is written by Ryan Tedder and Bonnie McKee. In the show's universe, the song is written by Tedder, who plays himself.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History The first sermon associated with the church was in the home of John Griffith in September 1845, and it is believed to be the first Welsh church \\"in the whole region west of the Mississippi River\\", according to a 1905 account in the Columbus Gazette. The congregation was founded as a Congregational church the following year, also in the Griffith home. In 1848 they acquired the same house and remodeled it for their meeting house. The cemetery in the church yard was established in 1851. The meeting house served their needs until their first church building was constructed in 1864. The old building was sold and converted into a horse barn. This congregation is the mother church of two other Welsh congregations. with The Iowa City congregation was founded in 1849, and the Williamsburg, Iowa congregation was founded over a dispute about the use of Welsh during services. Owen Evans led those that advocated for English services to found the Williamsburg congregation around 1860. The present church was completed in 1887 for $1,828.56 and it was consecrated debt-free. For over 50 years it was the location for the annual meeting of the Welsh Congregational Church Association, known as the Gymanfa. It was also the site for an annual Eisteddfod, a festival of oratory, poetry, and musical contests. The congregation continued to worship here until 1954 when it disbanded because of a decline in membership. The closure was only temporary as efforts were begun in 1963 to re-establish the congregation. It is now associated with the United Church of Christ. Architecture The church is located on a rise above a county highway. It is a simple frame building that rests on a concrete foundation. There are four stained glass windows on the side walls. On the roof above the main entrance is a spire that rests on a square base and a hexagonal drum. To the north of the church building is the cemetery.

She also plays for the German national team, with which she won two European titles, was runner-up at 2010 and 2014 World Championships, won a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London and won a silver medal at the Rio 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. President Joachim Gauck awarded the team Germany's highest sporting honour, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf), twice (2012 and 2016). Biography Mareike Miller was born on 3 August 1990, the daughter of Karl-Heinz and Kristin. She has a brother, Nils. She is nicknamed \\"MA\\". Miller began playing basketball at the age of seven, and made her debut with a women's senior club team in Germany when she was 14. In that first game, she suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Over the next four years, she underwent knee surgery four times, three in the right knee, and once in the left, leaving her knees scarred. On each occasion she took eight months to recover, and ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament within weeks of returning to playing. At the age of 18, Miller was forced to give up her dream of playing basketball. However, her physical education teacher suggested that she try wheelchair basketball, a sport she had never heard of. Although she is a wheelchair basketball player, Miller does not require a wheelchair for everyday activities, and is classified as a 4.5 point player with a minimal disability. Being able to move her body fully gives the tall center a height advantage, but she found that shooting from the free throw line in a chair requires as much force as shooting standing from the three-point line. When Miller took up wheelchair basketball in 2008, she was not thinking of making the national team, but with hard work and daily practice, she made it in just one year. That year she started playing for ASV Bonn in the German regional league. In 2009, she began attending University of Wisconsin-Whitewater in the United States, where she studied business administration. She found the workload much higher than in Germany. Whereas most German clubs trained only two of three times a week, training in the United States was every day, with weight and training rooms available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. While in Germany for summer breaks, she trained with the second division team Essen Hot Rolling Bears and travelled twice a week to Cologne to train with the K√∂ln 99ers. In 2011, she captained the German Under 25 (U25) National team, competing at their first ever World Championships. In March 2012, her UWW Warhawks team, coached by Daniel T. Price, defeated the University of Alabama 63‚Äì34 to win the US Intercollegiate National Championships in a game in which Miller scored 17 points and had 13 rebounds. Later that year, Miller headed to Australia, Netherlands and Charlotte, North Carolina for training camps with the German women's wheelchair basketball national team before the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. In the Gold Medal match in London, the team faced the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, who had defeated them 48‚Äì46 in Sydney just a few months before, in front of a crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena. The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six- point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. Miller scored 19 points, more than any other player in the match, and was a key factor in Germany winning 58‚Äì44. \\"Most of my shots weren‚Äôt even any crazy shots or any outside shots,‚Äù Miller said. \\"They were the same shots I took in the others games, but I played more in this game, and I had many more easy opportunities getting into the paint.\\" \\"I‚Äôm always one of the shooters, but I think Australia underestimated me and didn‚Äôt defend me as well as some of the other girls. They left me open a lot and I got some big shots, so it went well for me. It just worked out that I scored the most points in the final, but it wasn‚Äôt deliberate.\\" It was the first gold medal that Germany had won in women's wheelchair basketball at the Paralympics since 1984. They were awarded the Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012, and were named German Team of the Year for 2012. \\"Many times, I was told that after winning a gold medal, I have achieved the most I can, so I could quit now,\\" Miller later wrote, \\"But I disagree.\\" Mareike Miller at World Championships 2014. After a devastating loss in the European Championship final on home soil in 2013, the German team claimed silver at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Toronto, Canada, 2015, Miller had to have more surgeries on her knees and thus could not play with the German team. At the 2016 Paralympic Games, she returned and won silver after losing the final to the United States. After the 2016 Paralympic Games, several athletes and the German national team head coach retired. Miller remained as one of the experienced players of the team, now playing for Martin Otto, the PE teacher who got her to play the sport in the first place. As part of the captain trio, she led her team to another European Championship silver medal in 2017, showing that the team even with many changes is continuing on a high level. 2018 marks the year of World Championships in Hamburg, Germany. Miller will captain the team competing in front of her home crowds as she also currently lives in Hamburg and plays for the professional team BG Baskets Hamburg.

She was a member of the folk rock band The Lumineers from 2010 to 2018. Early life Pekarek was born and raised in Denver, Colorado. She grew up in a household with her parents and one sibling, an older sister. She began playing the cello at age nine, performing in her school's orchestra. She chose the cello because the school's policy was that only fifth-graders could play woodwind instruments, while fourth-graders could play stringed instruments. Explaining her thinking, she said, \\"...I went with cello because I wanted to get started sooner.\\" Growing up, she enjoyed listening to powerful vocalists such as Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin, and Otis Redding. Her parents introduced her to American folk music via vinyl records of Bob Dylan, Carole King, and Emmylou Harris. She attended college at the University of Northern Colorado, where she initially majored in vocal performance and musical theatre. She changed majors, however, graduating with a degree in music education; she initially planned on becoming a choir teacher. Although she did not play the cello much while attending college, she earned some income post-graduation as a cellist at weddings. The Lumineers After finishing her degree in music education, Pekarek responded to a Craigslist ad posted by Wesley Schultz and Jeremiah Fraites. Schultz and Fraites were looking for a cellist to join their band, The Lumineers. Explaining why she responded to the ad, Pekarek said, \\"I was living with my parents and kind of just looking for something to do. I thought it would be a fun way to pass my time until I found something full time to do.\\" For several months, the three rehearsed and played shows around Denver. They decided to undertake a small- scale concert tour for 30 days, playing shows from Portland, Oregon to New York City. Of her decision to tour with the band, Pekarek said, \\"I was only 23 years old. If you are going to be in a band and do something stupid, it might as well be then.\\" The 30-day tour was followed by a tour of the West Coast and a weekly installment at The Living Room, a venue in New York. While her contribution to the band was most noticeable as a cellist, she had a larger role as a vocalist in live performances, including performing a duet with Schultz. She took a passive approach to songwriting, with no credits on their first album and two credits on their second album (\\"Gale Song\\" and \\"My Eyes\\"). Pekarek said that she was content with her limited role in songwriting, stating of Fraites and Schultz, \\"They're very meticulous and being a part of that writing team is not for the faint of heart...I'm quite content to stay out of it.\\" Pekarek stated that she struggled with inequality in the music industry as the sole female member of The Lumineers, saying that women \\"have to talk twice as loud and perform twice as hard, and you have to wear heels! I see myself working really hard to make everything equal between all of us. The boys are learning a lot about it and they've been really supportive, but there've been some growing pains.\\" She also stated, \\"...if I were to join a new band, I would definitely not be the only girl in it. It would be a much easier life to have another female around.\\" On October 18, 2018, it was announced that Pekarek would be leaving the band to pursue a solo career. Speaking of her reasoning behind leaving the band, Pekerak said: Musical theatre Pekarek wrote a \\"folk opera\\" called Rattlesnake about Katherine McHale Slaughterback, popularly called \\"Rattlesnake Kate,\\" who was a renowned snake hunter of Colorado. Pekarek created a studio album of the songs from Rattlesnake. Rattlesnake was released on January 18, 2019 via S-Curve Records. Pekarek enjoys singing barbershop music competitively as a member of Sweet Adelines International, seeing plays, and conducting musical training workshops with school-children of her native Colorado.  Solo (2019 to present) To promote the 2019 release of her debut solo album, Rattlesnake, Pekarek announced her initial headlining solo tour since her departure from The Lumineers.

The battalion had been under orders to accompany 1st Armoured to the Middle East, but these were cancelled and the men returned their tropical uniforms to store. In common with other infantry battalions transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, 112's personnel would have continued to wear their Foresters cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps, and the regiment continued to add the parenthesis '(Foresters)' after the RAC title. The first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Claude Lancaster, a Member of Parliament and Reserve officer who had raised 9th Foresters and commanded it at Dunkirk. He was made an Honorary Colonel in the Royal Armoured Corps when his term of command ended.Monthly Army List September 1939.Quarterly Army List January 1944. Service 112 RAC was assigned to the newly formed 42nd Armoured Division as its armoured car regiment.Joslen, p. 29. The regiment's initial equipment was the Bison concrete armoured lorry with extemporised armour and Standard Beaverette armoured cars handed over by 42nd Division's Reconnaissance Regiment, with Daimler Dingo scout cars as armoured command vehicles. 112 RAC left 42nd Division in February 1943 and later became a draft-finding unit for other armoured car regiments fighting in the Normandy Campaign. One of the regiment's last duties was to carry out trials on the 95mm gun version of the Harry Hopkins light tank, even though no-one in the regiment had ever seen a 95mm gun.War Diary 112th Regt RAC, January‚ÄìOctober 1944, The National Archives, file WO 166/14603. Despite personal appeals from the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel A. G. Miller, DSO, to General Sir Miles Christopher Dempsey commanding the British Second Army in North-western Europe, and from Colonel Lancaster to the War Office, to allow the unit to go overseas, 112 RAC ceased to exist on 14 October 1944, when it reverted to the title of 9th Foresters, which was placed in suspended animation. The last entry in the War Diary notes: ::The history of this Regiment is a pure example of the complete inefficiency of 'A' Branch at the War Office, in as much as many hundreds of officers and men have wasted valuable years of their lives training for precisely nothing.

Definition and essentials of the contract = Definition = The contract of sale, as it is known in South Africa today, derives its origins from the Roman consensual contract of emptio venditio. In D 18.1 (the title devoted to the contract of emptio venditio), there is no all-embracing definition of the special contract, but certain critical features can be extracted from the early fragments of the title: > Sale is a contract of the law of nations, and so is concluded by simple > agreement.Paul D 18.1.1.2. There is no sale without a price.Ulpian D > 18.1.2.1. There can be no sale without a thing to be sold.Pomponius D > 18.1.8.pr. The Roman-Dutch lawyers followed these guidelines closely in their definitions of the contract of sale. For example, Voet said: > Purchase defined‚ÄîBut in this title, as distinguished from lease, it is a > bonae fidei contract, resting on consent, by which it is arranged that > merchandise shall be exchanged at a definite price. There are three > essential requirements for it‚Äîconsent, merchandise and price. If one of them > is wanting, there is no purchase.Commentarius ad Pandectas 18.1.1 (Gane's > translation). In South African law today, the definition of a contract of sale remains virtually the same. In Treasurer-General v Lippert,(1883) 2 SC 172. the full board of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cited with approval the following statement by De Villiers CJ: > A sale is a contract in which one person (the seller or vendor) promises to > deliver a thing to another (the buyer or emptor), the latter agreeing to pay > a certain price. According to Mackeurtan, > Purchase and sale (emptio venditio) is a mutual contract for the transfer of > possession of a thing in exchange for a price. It has three essentials: > consent (consensus ad idem); a thing sold (merx); and a price (pretium).Sale > of Goods in SA at 1. Remember that a sale contract is a special form of contract, and so all law discussed under the article on the South African law of contract is relevant in considering sale contracts. = Essentials = In general terms, the essential elements of a contract of sale are no different from the essential elements of any other contract. There must be contractual capacity and consensus, the agreement must be legal (not contrary to public policy), performance must be possible, and any formalities required by law must be complied with. The contract of sale does, however, have a number of additional substantive requirements (known as essentialia), which are assimilated into the general contractual structure. Of course, like any contract, the requirement of consensus, or agreement, is the most important general element.  Agreement  The parties must be in agreement that the object of the contract is to purchase and to sell the res concerned, for the price agreed upon, and that the seller (usually) ensures the transfer of possession and/or ownership of the res to the buyer. The general principles relating to consensus in purchase and sale are the same as those pertaining to other multilateral consensual contracts. The relevant points may be summarised as follows: * There must be an agreement of the minds of the parties, mutually communicated, usually by means of offer and acceptance. * The parties must act with the intention of contracting a sale. there must be a concursus animorum animo contrahendi.Wasmuth v Jacobs 1987 (3) SA 629 (SWA) at 633D. * The agreement should be free from mistake or error, and should not have been induced wrongfully by misrepresentation, duress or undue influence. * The agreement should be legal and satisfy the dictates of public policy. * The agreement should be rational. It cannot therefore exist in cases of extreme youth, irrational intoxication or insanity. In sales in particular, there must be agreement as to: * the subject matter of the sale and its essential characteristics; * the price to be paid; and * any other item raised in the negotiations and expressly or impliedly regarded as material. The two essentialia of a contract of sale are therefore * the thing sold; and * the price to be paid. = Thing sold = The parties to the sale must reach agreement over the subject matter of the sale.Hamburg v Pickard 1906 TS 1010. The general requirement is that the subject matter of the sale should be * defined and ascertainable (although the merx need not be entirely specific);See, on this, JR 209 Investments v Pine Villa Country Estate 2009 (4) SA 302 (SCA). and * existing at the time of the contract, or having a potential existence. It is best to tackle the intricacies of this particular section by first examining things that can be sold, and secondly, things that cannot validly be sold.  Things that can be sold  Generally speaking, anything can be sold, be it corporeal or incorporeal in nature. Physical existence is not required for there to be a valid sale. Anything that can be held, possessed or sued for can be the subject of a valid sale.D 18.1.34.1; Voet 18.1.13. There are, however, certain more specialised issues that need to be discussed for the full picture to emerge. These things or articles are not only restricted by common law, but are also prohibited by legislation, except where the courts can set aside such stipulations. The question in respect of a sale of res sua is whether or not a person can enter into a valid contract of sale, involving the purchase of a thing that is (unbeknownst to him) his own property already. The general rule is that things owned by the buyer cannot be the subject of a valid sale.See Cawcutt v Teperson and Saacks 1916 CPD 406. It is possible, however, for the purchaser to buy rights in his own property that he does not yet hold.See Hilton Quarries Social and Athletic Club v CIR 1956 (3) SA 108 (N). Unascertained goods may form the subject matter of a valid contract of sale. Such sales may be termed generic sales, or emptio generis. Future goods, or goods that do not yet exist, may also be the subject of a valid sale. Such a sale may take one of two forms.For a discussion of these two forms, see Hamilton-Browning v Denis Barker Trust 2001 (4) SA 1131 (N) 1139. A sale can come into being if it involves something that does not yet in exist, provided that the thing may, in the ordinary course of events, come into existence.See Tulloch v Marsh supra. Pothier says the following: > There cannot, in truth, be a contract of sale without a thing sold, but it > is sufficient that the thing sold may exist, though it has no present > existence. Thus, it is common before harvest, to sell the wine which we may > make; and in such case, there is a sufficient thing to constitute the object > of a valid contract, though as the thing sold does not yet exist, the > contract depends upon the condition of its future existence; and if it > should not yet happen to exist, that is, if no wine should be made, there is > no sale.A Treatise on the Contract of Sale para 5. These sort of contracts are known as emptio rei speratae. A classic example would be that where Boucher agrees to purchase Smith's next crop of maize at R40 per bag. Because the sale involves maize, it appears at first glance to be a generic sale, but it is distinguishable on at least two grounds: # The source of the grain is specified: It must be Smith's crop. # The agreement is subject to a suspensive condition: If Smith's crop does not materialise, there is no sale.See Richtown Development (Pty) Ltd v Dusterwald 1981 (3) SA 691 (W). It is possible to purchase the expectation or hope that something might come into existence, irrespective of whether it does or does not come into existence in future. The jurisprudent Pomponius is quoted as saying: > Sometimes, indeed, there is held to be a sale, even without a thing, as > where what is bought is, as it were, a chance. This is the case with the > purchase of a catch of birds or fish. The contract is valid even if nothing > results, because it is the purchase of a hope.D 18.1.8.1. Such a contract is a contract emptio spei.See also Pothier Sale para 5. For example, Boucher agrees to purchase Smith's next catch of fish for R200. What is sold in this case is the hope or expectation of a catch, not the catch itself. The spes exists at the date of sale. It makes no difference to the obligations of the parties whether Smith catches anything at all. Thus, Boucher runs the risk of making a loss, in that he must pay even if nothing comes into existence, but may benefit in that he may receive greater value than his capital outlay. Res aliena, things that are not the property of the seller, may also be the subject of a valid sale. It is not essential that the seller be the owner of the goods at the time of delivery. The sale is not void simply because the seller is not the owner of the res vendita, and has sold it without the owner's authority. What is essential is that the seller delivers the property to the buyer, and ensures that his possession is not thereafter interfered with by anyone with better title. The buyer in such circumstances is protected (at the very least) by the residual warranty against eviction.See Kleynhans Brothers v Wessels' Trustee 1927 AD 271. Delivery of the res, in such circumstances, would result in transfer from the seller to the buyer of whatever rights the seller had. The buyer would acquire civil possession of the res, the consequences of which would be, inter alia, * the right to ownership upon completion of prescription; * the right to the fruits of the property; and * the right to use possessory remedies. Things that are the subject of litigation in rem (res litigiosa) may be the subject of a valid contract of sale as well. Such a sale might occur where property, which is the subject of pending court action, is sold in the interim. Should such property be sold, the purchaser is bound by the judgment in the action. The successful plaintiff is entitled to recover it from the purchaser (the new possessor) by execution, without further proceedings. Where property is the subject of an action in rem, it becomes res litigiosa at litis contestatio.  Things that cannot be sold  Various things cannot be sold under South African law. Res extra commercium are among them. Numerous rules of statutory and common law prohibit the sale of certain things, often on grounds of public policy. For example, the common law does not sanction the sale of a person (slavery), and statute prohibits the sale of human tissue,s 60 of the National Health Act 31 of 2003. and of many narcotics, chemical substances and so forth. It is also quite clearly impossible to purchase a thing that never existed. The most extreme example would be the putative sale of a mythical or fictitious object. Justinian says: > Anything, whether movable or immovable, which admits of private ownership, > may be made the object of a stipulation; but if a man stipulates for the > delivery of a thing that either does not or cannot exist, such as [...] an > impossible creature, like a hippocentaur, the contract is void.Institutes > 3.19.1. Where the subject of a proposed contract of sale is a specific thing, and it has, prior to the agreement, and unbeknownst to the parties, ceased to exist, the agreement is ordinarily void. In Theron Ltd (in Liquidation) v Gross,1929 CPD 345. Watermeyer J said, > Undoubtedly it is a principle of our law that a contract for the sale of a > specific thing, made in ignorance of the fact that the things had been > destroyed at the time of the contract, is not binding upon the parties.347. For a good factual example, see Scrutton and Scrutton v Erlich & Co and Others.1908 TS 300. It is impossible for res litigiosa to be sold to the seller's advocate or attorney. This is known as champerty. Mackeurtan states, > There can be no valid sale, at any stage of the proceedings, of property the > subject of such an action, to the advocate or attorney of the seller. Such > agreements are known as pacta de quota litis and are void.14. The sale by Wells to Samuels of an inheritance expected from Hutton, while Hutton is still alive, is stigmatised by being unenforceable, although it is not void ab initio. Once Hutton has died, however, an inheritance may be sold.  Sales by description and sample  Some sales occur either by description or by sample.See Kerr Sale and Lease 11‚Äì23. = Price = In Westinghouse Brake and Equipment (Pty) Ltd v Bilger Engineering (Pty) Ltd,1986 (2) SA 555 (A). Corbett JA said the following: > It is a general rule of our law that there can be no valid contract of sale > unless the parties have agreed, expressly or by implication, upon a purchase > price. Mackeurtan identifies the following essentials in connection with price. It must be * serious; * fixed or capable of ascertainment; and * sound in current money.  Serious  Being serious in amount implies that any price that is real, not illusory, suffices. If the price set is merely nominal in amount, this may be a strong indication that the parties intend a donation, not a sale. The question can be settled only on the circumstances of each individual case. In other words, the price should be real and bear some sort of relationship to the actual value of the thing, and the seller must intend actually exacting the price. Ulpian says, > If a person sells for a small price meaning to make a gift, the sale is > valid, for it is only when donation is the sole consideration moving the > sale that we hold it absolutely void; but when a thing is sold at a reduced > price as a mode of donation there is no doubt that the sale is good.D > 18.1.38. The parties are not prevented by this requirement from driving a hard bargain and obtaining the thing for a very low price, or selling it for a very high price, given the intention to buy or sell for that price. It follows then that the price need not necessarily be fair or equivalent to the value of the thing, but that it should be a real price the seller must intend to exact and the buyer intend to pay. Zulman and Kairinos say, > The policy of the law is to allow everyone, in the absence of fraud, to make > the best bargain he can, and both vendor and the purchaser are entitled by > the exercise of superior shrewdness, to circumvent each other as long as > such circumvention does not amount to fraud.\\"Norman's Purchase and Sale 46. Although it is a question of fact, a price is often not held to be real or serious if it bears absolutely no relation to the value of the thing sold. This is the situation, for example, where the price is truly nominal or illusory‚Äîas in circumstances where the seller has no intention whatsoever of exacting the so-called price.See CIR v Saner 1927 TPD 162 for a good example. Some parties may also dress up a contract as a \\"sale,\\" when in fact it is designed to be some other form of contract entirely.See Zandberg v Van Zyl 1910 AD 302; BC Plant Hire CC t/a BC Carriers v Grenco (SA) (Pty) Ltd 2004 (4) SA 550 (C) 560‚Äì563.  Certain, fixed or readily ascertainable  Ordinarily speaking, the price to be paid for the merx must be fixed by the parties. This is not an absolute rule. The general principle is id certum est quod certum reddi potest: That which can readily be made certain is certain. It is therefore not necessary that the price actually have been fixed to fulfil this requirement; it is sufficient if the parties have agreed upon a method by which the price can be fixed. In Burroughs Machines Ltd v Chenille Corporation of SA (Pty) Ltd,1964 (1) SA 669 (W). Colman J said, > It is I think clear that there can be no valid contract of sale unless the > parties have agreed, expressly or by implication, upon a purchase price. > They must either fix the amount of that price in their contract or agree > upon some external standard by the application whereof it will be possible > to determine the price without further reference to them.\\"670. If the parties take the latter route, the important thing is that it must be possible to ascertain the price by the method agreed upon. This can be done in several ways: # The price would be regarded as readily ascertainable if it could be fixed by reference to some independent circumstances. # The price may be left to a named third party agreed upon by the parties to the contract.See Odendaalsrus Municipality v New Nigel Estate Gold Mining Co Ltd 1948 (2) SA 656 (O) 663, 665.See also Mufamadi and others v Dorbyl Finance (Pty) Ltd 1996 (1) SA 799 (A). Should the third party be unable to set the price, or refuse to do so, there is no sale. If the third party cannot be identified‚Äîfor example, where the parties have not fixed a way of identifying the third party, or have not named him‚Äîthen the contract does not come into existence; there is no sale. Similarly, where the agreement is that one of the parties or their nominee fixes the price, there is no sale.D 18.1.35.1; Grotius Inleiding 3.14.23; Westinghouse at 574C-D. This basic principle of the common law of sale has, however, been called into question in a strenuous obiter dictum in the case of NBS Boland Bank v One Berg River Drive; Deeb v ABSA Bank; Friedman v Standard Bank.1999 (4) SA 928 (SCA). # It is quite acceptable for the parties to agree expressly that the purchase price is \\"the usual or the current market price.\\" This scenario presents no difficulties. The formula \\"the usual price\\" may also be implied in many sales where no purchase price is expressly mentioned. The situation regarding the fixing of the price in such circumstances is as follows: There is an implied contract on the basis of the usual price at which that commodity is sold, or the current market price of that particular type of goods.Machanick v Simon 1920 CPD 333 at 338.R v Pierson 1942 EDL 117 at 121‚Äì2.R v Kramer 1948 (3) SA 48 (N).  Current money  The price must consist in valid currency. It need not be expressed in South Africa currency; if it is not, however, then in some convertible foreign currency. Where the consideration is completely in goods, rather than in money, the contract is one of exchange, not a sale. If it consists partly in money and partly in goods, the contract may be a sale or an exchange, depending upon the intention of the parties. Generally, though, the contract is a sale. This section considers legal consequences of the contract of sale, along with those of conditional sales, which modify the usual consequences. Certain relevant contractual terms are also briefly be discussed.  Legal effects of the contract = Passing of ownership = It is not a requirement of a valid contract of sale that ownership should pass from seller to buyer. Although parties to a sale usually contemplate this happening, it is not an essential feature of a contract of sale, and (as we have seen) sales by non-owners are permissible. At common law, the transfer of a real right of ownership (the performance of the contract) is regarded as a separate legal transaction from the contract itself, which creates only personal obligations. Because ownership does pass as a result of most contracts of sale, however, the issue of ownership is an important incidence of a sale.For more on this topic, see the entry on the law of property in South Africa. Usually, to transfer ownership in a res, it is not only necessary that it be physically delivered by the owner; it is necessary also that the owner have the intention of transferring the right of ownership to the buyer, and that the buyer have the intention of becoming the owner of the thing in question.Air-Kel (Edms) Bpk h/a Merkel Motors v Bodenstein 1980 (3) SA 917 (A) 922F. As far as sales are concerned, there are certain additional refinements:  Immovable property  In the case of immovables, ownership passes upon registration of transfer in the Deeds Registry. The position is regulated by the Deeds Registries Act.Act 47 of 1937. In other words, registration constitutes delivery in the case of immovables, and ownership passes whether the price has been paid or not.See the entry on the law of conveyancing in South Africa.  Incorporeals  Ownership in incorporeals is transferred by means of cession.  Movable property  Ownership in movable property is transferred * upon delivery of the res; coupled with * either payment of the purchase price, the provision of security or the giving of credit. = Delivery = Delivery usually occurs by means of traditio. Ownership passes on traditio only if the following essentials are present: * The thing must be capable of ownership. * The seller must have legal capacity to sell. * Traditio must be made by the seller (or his agent), since the owner of the thing cannot be deprived of his ownership by the wrongful act of another, and no-one can transfer greater rights in a thing than he possesses. No one can make someone else the owner of a thing he does not own. * The seller must intend to pass ownership to the buyer. * Delivery must be made to the buyer (or his agent). * The buyer must have legal capacity to become owner of the thing. * The buyer must accept delivery, intending to acquire ownership in the thing.  Forms of delivery  Delivery may occur in two ways.  Actual delivery  Actual delivery (traditio vera) occurs where the res vendita is physically handed over by one person to another de manu in manum.  Constructive delivery  Constructive delivery concerns those various methods of transferring ownership by which no physical handing over of the res vendita takes place. There are five methods of constructive delivery: * delivery with a long hand; * delivery with a short hand; * constitutum possessorium; * symbolic delivery; and * attornment. = Payment = Ownership passes on delivery only if cash is paid, or if credit has been allowed. In Laing v SA Milling Co Ltd,1921 AD 387. Juta JA said, \\"On a sale of movables followed by delivery the property does not pass until the purchaser has paid the money or secured the seller for the same, or unless the sale is on credit.\\"398. At this juncture, it is important to distinguish between how ownership passes in cash and credit sales respectively. In a cash sale, ownership passes once there has been (in addition to delivery) due payment of the purchase price. In a sale on credit, the fact that credit has been given is an indication that ownership merely passed on delivery. In an ordinary credit sale, the seller cannot claim that he did not intend ownership to pass until the full price had been paid. (This does not cover the situation where the sale is one subject to a pactum reservati dominii). In the absence of agreement (express or implied) that credit has been granted, it is presumed that every sale is a cash sale.Lendalease Finance Ltd v Corporacion de Mercadeo Agricola 1976 (4) SA 464 (A) at 490F. The point is well illustrated in Daniels v Cooper.(1880) 1 EDC 174. The presumption of a cash sale may therefore be rebutted by adducing evidence of an agreement to give credit. If the rebuttal succeeds, ownership passes on delivery. If credit has not been granted, ownership does not pass until the price is paid‚Äîeven if delivery has, in the meantime, taken place. An agreement to give credit must be clear and specific. That being said, it is now much more difficult to show an agreement on credit than under the common law. This is so because of legislation. If the sale happens to be one on credit, the requirements of the National Credit ActAct 34 of 2005. apply to it. Where a sale is for cash, and the seller accepts a cheque for payment of the cash price, ownership does not pass (notwithstanding the delivery of the res vendita) unless the cheque is met when presented for payment.Bold v Cooper 1949 (1) SA 1195 (T). = Risk and benefit = Common law  In most ordinary, day-to-day commercial transactions, the conclusion of a contract of sale and the passing of ownership by delivery of the res occurs instantaneously. In some types of sale, however, there is a delay between the time of entry into the contract of sale and the time of transfer of possession and ownership. The question that must be answered in these circumstances is this: Who gains the advantage of any benefits accruing to the res, and who bears the risk of damage occurring to it, during this window period? = Risk = Mackeurtan defines risk as follows: > By risk is meant the loss resulting from damage to, or destruction of, the > thing sold, or any other disadvantage accruing to, or affecting it, arising > through any agency other than the breach of contract or wrongful act or > default of the seller.179. Losses that fall within the rule include those due to vis maior, casus fortuitus, general deterioration over time and even theft. Voet says: > Under the name of risk falls here every disadvantage which overtakes a thing > sold, such as death; running away and wounding in the case of [...] an > animal sold; an opening of the ground in the case of a field [...]; > conflagration and collapse in the case of a house; shipwreck in the case of > a ship; mustiness, souring or leakage in the case of wine; and finally > spoiling, going bad, perishing or purloining in the case of all > things.18.6.1. For a modern example, see Van der Merwe v Viljoen.1953 (1) SA 60 (A). Not falling within the rule are losses caused by the failure of the seller to observe the appropriate standard of care.  Where the risk lies  South Africa follows the Roman-law rule with regard to risk. In the absence of negligence on the part of the seller, the general rule is that the risk passes to the buyer when the sale is perfecta: that is, as soon as the agreement of sale is concluded, and before delivery or payment of the price.See D 18.6.8.pr; Inst 3.23.3; Rood's Trustees v Scott and De Villiers 1910 TPD 47; BC Plant Hire CC t/a BC Carriers v Grenco (SA) (Pty) Ltd 2004 4 SA 550 (C) 563; Southern Era Resources Ltd v Farndell NO 2010 (4) SA 200 (SCA) para 9. The natural consequence of this rule is that the full price must be paid by the buyer, even though the thing sold is damaged or destroyed before it is handed over. This general rule applies, however, where: * The parties have agreed to the contrary * Specific goods still must be weighed, measured, or counted * The goods are unascertained * There is a statutory provision to the contrary * There is default by either party The parties may vary the normal rules regarding risk by express agreement in their contract. Courts are loath to accept that such an agreement to vary was implied from the parties' negotiations,See Horne v Hutt 1915 CPD 331. although it is possible for this to occur. One salient question here is whether or not an undertaking by the seller to deliver the goods at a specified destination necessarily implies agreement to vary the incidence of the risk. The answer would appear to be no. Why should a mere agreement to deliver at a distance imply a term that risk is to remain with the seller until delivery? The situation would be quite different where the seller undertakes to deliver the thing \\"safely\\" to the agreed destination. The general rule also applies where specific goods must be weighed, measured, or counted. In this regard, a distinction must be drawn between sales ad quantitatem and sales per aversionem. Where the sale is ad quantitatem, there is a sale of specific goods, but the price depends on the counting, weighing or measuring: for example, R300 per sheep, for the flock. The risk does not pass in this case until the price has been ascertained by counting the flock. Pothier explains the situation in the following way: > If the sale is of things which consist in quantitate, and which are sold by > weight, number or measure, as if one sells ten casks of corn [...] ten > thousand pounds of sugar, or one hundred carp, the sale is not perfect until > the corn is measured, the sugar weighed, or the carp counted [....] For this > reason, until the thing is measured, weighed or counted, it does not become > at the risk of the buyer; for the risk cannot fall upon some indeterminate > thing.Sale para 309. Where the sale is per aversionem, it is, as it were, in the gross. The price is a lump sum for the ascertained goods, even if the res vendita is of a type normally weighed, measured, or counted: for example, a flock of sheep at R10,000 for the lot. Pothier says: > But if the goods are not sold by weight or measure, but per aversionem, that > is, in bulk, and for a single and only price; in such case, the sale is > perfect from the instant of the contract, and from that time these goods are > at the risk of the buyer. While the situation envisaged in respect of unascertained goods is analogous to that above, the price is usually ascertained, but the res vendita is not. The subject matter has not yet been appropriated to the contract: for example, 100 bags of maize at R55 per bag from a warehouse containing 10,000 bags. Risk in the res vendita does not pass until goods answering the description in the contract have been appropriated to the contract. For appropriation to occur, there must be some overt act by the seller, such as a setting aside or marking of the relevant goods.See Marais v Deare and Dietz 1878 Buch 169; Poppe, Schunhoff and Guttery v Mosenthal and Co 1879 Buch 91, and Taylor v Mackie, Dunn and Co 1879 Buch 166. The general rule also applies, obviously, where there is a statutory provision to the contrary.See in particular s 59 of the Customs and Excise Act 91 of 1964. The ordinary rules of risk are altered where a party is in default of his obligations under the contract. The rule varies by * Fraud of either party * Failure of the seller to observe the required standard of care * Default of either party in performance * The doing of anything by either party that hinders the other in his performance The rule here is that the presence of one of these factors relieves the injured party of the incidence of risk, save in so far as any damage of the thing may be due to his own misconduct or gross negligence.See the case of Fitwell Clothing v Quorn Hotel 1966 (3) SA 407 (RAD). = Benefit = Kerr defines benefit as \\"any natural or civil fruits and other similar advantages, gains or profits.\\"Sale and Lease 235. The general rule is that the benefit in the res vendita follows the risk. Any benefits pass to the buyer once the sale is perfecta. This does not, however, include fortuitous gains.See the question posed earlier under contracts emptio spei. The benefit must be directly connected with and actually produced by the property that has been sold. If the profits were purely accidental, and would not have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time of concluding the sale, the buyer cannot claim such a benefit.See Van Deventer v Erasmus 1960 (4) SA 100 (T).  Consumer Protection Act  This area of the law faces significant changes under the Consumer Protection Act.s 19(2). = Conditional sales = As already indicated, the ordinary rules of the common law regarding the passing of ownership and risk or benefit may be modified if the parties agree to certain conditions.  Conditions  \\"The contracting parties,\\" writes Mackeurtan, \\"may include in their agreement any provisions that they wish, subject to the limitations hereinafter laid down. These may suspend the operation, or cause the dissolution of the contract, until or upon the happening of an uncertain future event [....] The first class are suspensive, and the second resolutive.\\"34. Whether a condition is suspensive or resolutive is a matter of construction. The courts look beyond the ipse dixit of the parties and interpret the words as they stand.Palm 15 (Pty) Ltd v Cottontail Homes (Pty) Ltd 1978 (2) SA 872 (A). The following prerequisites must exist for a condition to be operative: * The coming into force or dissolution of the contract must be made to depend upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of an uncertain future event. * It must not be impossible, illegal or immoral. * It must not be subversive of the essentials of the contract.  Terms  As noted above, conditions proper affect the operation, or bring about the dissolution, of the contract. On the other hand, terms only modify the ordinary effect of the contract. For example, the parties might agree to a term that the ordinary rule of risk is varied.  Suspensive conditions  The legal effect of suspensive conditions in the law of sale is a matter of some controversy, but effectively the position is this: Unlike other contracts, a contract subject to a suspensive condition only becomes a contract of sale once the condition is fulfilled. Since this is contrary to the common-law position (and, indeed, to logic), the significant types of contracts with the character of a sale, and subject to suspensive conditions, have been covered by legislative amendments, so that the anomaly does not apply. Most of its significant effects in practice have been ameliorated by legislation.  Resolutive conditions  A valid resolutive condition has the following effect: * The contract has full legal effect from the moment it is perfecta pending fulfilment of the condition. * An affirmative resolutive condition is fulfilled by the occurrence of the event; a negative resolutive condition is fulfilled when it is certain that the event will not occur. * Should the condition be fulfilled, the contract is dissolved retrospectively, and must therefore be regarded as never having existed.  Examples  The following are examples of commonly-encountered conditional sales. = Approval of financial stability or availability of loan = A suspensive condition is sometimes found in commercial transactions to the effect that the transaction depends upon the seller's approval of the buyer's financial stability. There is no contract of sale until the seller gives his approval. He must exercise his discretion reasonably and in good faith.Machanick v Simon 1920 CPD 333. A similar clause is found in a deed of sale, where the sale of land is subject to the conditions that the buyer is able to: * Sell his previous home (if relevant) * Get approval for a loan secured by a mortgage bond from a recognised financial services provider within a particular period of time If it becomes clear the conditions cannot be satisfied, the contract falls through. = Sale or return = Sale or return (pactum displicentiae) is a type of conditional sale often encountered in practice. It involves the buyer receiving goods from the seller with the option of becoming the owner. He can exercise his option in several ways: * by buying the goods at the named price; * by selling the goods to another; or * by keeping them for so long that it would be unreasonable to return them. This type of contract could be considered as subject to a condition that suspends the sale until the buyer has done one of the above-mentioned things to indicate his intention to become the buyer.Juta and Co v Rorich 1924 TPD 730. Mackeurtan, however, feels that contracts of sale or return are examples of contracts subject to a resolutive condition.40‚Äì41. = Sales on approval = There is some disagreement about approval sales. Some argue that these are sales subject to a suspensive condition: Since the sale is subject to the examination and approval of the buyer, the operation of the sale is suspended until the buyer's approval has been expressed. There is another view: that these are sales subject to a resolutive condition. On this view, the sale transaction is carried out completely, and the client is charged. If, however, the client feels that the merchandise is no good, he is entitled to return the item to the seller, and the transaction is reversed. In modern-day consumer contracts, this seems to be the better view.  Residual obligations of the seller and remedies of the buyer = Seller required to take care of res vendita until merx is made available = The discussion of risk above indicates that the risk of accidental loss normally passes to the buyer as soon as the contract of sale is perfecta. This, however, does not release the seller from all responsibility for the thing sold while it remains in his possession. The general rule is that the seller is under an obligation to take care of the thing until the time comes for performance, and that he is responsible for any damage caused by his fraud or negligence. In Frumer v Maitland,1954 (3) SA 840 (A). Schreiner JA said, > It will be convenient to consider first the obligations of a vendor who has > not yet delivered the property sold. It is his duty to look after it as > would a bonus paterfamilias and if he fails in that duty the purchaser would > be entitled to claim damages, or, if, but only if, the result of the > vendor's neglect is that the thing sold is materially different from the > thing tendered, to repudiate the contract and to refuse to take > delivery.\\"845. Where it is the seller who is in mora, the seller becomes liable for all loss, no matter how it comes about.Voet 18.6.2.Wingerin v Ross 1951 (2) SA 82 (C). Only if it can be shown that the damage would nonetheless have occurred, even if the thing had been delivered, will the loss be the buyer's. The extent of the duty to take care pending delivery is altered if the buyer is in mora in taking delivery. If the buyer has failed to take delivery, the seller is only liable for the consequences of his gross negligence (culpa lata) or fraud (dolus). He is not liable for ordinary negligence.D 18.6.8. The measure of care may also be varied by agreement. Where the res vendita has been damaged or lost while in possession of the seller prior to delivery, and the responsibility is not the seller's, he must cede to the buyer any rights of action he might have in respect of the damage, so that the buyer might exercise these rights in covering his own loss. If, for example, the goods are stolen and found in possession of a third party (not the thief), the seller must cede his vindicatory rights to the buyer.  The buyer's remedies  Where the seller has not taken due care, the remedies available depend on whether the goods are specific or unascertained. = Specific goods = In the case of specific goods, where the damage is material, the buyer is entitled to refuse to accept delivery of the goods and to repudiate the contract, claim damages, and a refund of the price if paid. In other words, he is entitled to treat the situation as he would non-delivery of the thing. Where the damage is not material, the buyer must accept the delivery of the goods, and then claim damages.See the quotation from Frumer's case above. = Unascertained goods = Where the sale is of unascertained goods, the buyer may reject the goods and once again treat the seller as if there had been no delivery at all (whether the breach is major or not), provided the damage is not trifling. Where, however, the purchaser accepts the res vendita, but claims damages, the damages are estimated on the basis of the difference between the value of the sound goods and the value of the damaged goods delivered. The buyer may also claim any wasted necessary expenditure. = Seller's duty to make available the thing sold = This duty is the same as the duty to \\"deliver the res vendita,\\" as it is most often described‚Äîincluding in the new Consumer Protection Act.s 19(2). Some prefer Kerr's description. One should understand the terms \\"making the thing sold available\\" and \\"delivery\\" as being synonymous. Mackeurtan deals with this matter in great detail,65‚Äì122. enumerating the six elements of this duty (with semantic variations) as follows: # to make the thing available at the agreed time and place; # to make the thing available in the condition that it was at the time of sale; # to make the thing available in accordance with specifications regarding size, quantity, quality or any other aspect agreed upon in the contract of sale; # to make the thing available with all its accessories, appurtenances and fruits; # to place the buyer in a position whereby he acquires vacua possessio (undisturbed possession); and # to do, at the seller's own expense, whatever is necessary to make the thing sold available to the buyer.  Agreed time and place  The seller must make the thing available at the time and place stipulated in the contract. = Time = If no time is stipulated, the res vendita must be made available immediately (if performance is possible at the time of sale), or within a reasonable time (if the process must necessarily take time). The circumstance of each contract determines what is a reasonable time. A seller who fails to make the thing sold available at the appropriate time is in mora.Concrete Products Co (Pty) Ltd v Natal Leather Industries 1946 NPD 377. The seller is not entitled to deliver by instalments if the contract was not to that effect.Moosa v Robert Shaw & Co Ltd 1948 (4) SA 914 (T). Where periods are stated for delivery by instalments, though, the seller is bound to deliver as agreed upon. = Place = The seller must make the thing sold available at the place agreed upon in the contract. If no place is agreed upon, he must make it available at the place where the article is, if it is specific. If the res is unascertained, the seller must make it available at his place of business; if he has no place of business, then at his residence. If the thing is ordered to be manufactured, the thing must be made available at the place of manufacture, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary.Broderick Properties Ltd v Rood 1962 (4) SA 447 (T) at 453.Goldblatt v Merwe (1902) 19 SC 373.  Same condition as at time of sale  In Frumer v Maitland,1954 (3) SA 840 (A). Schreiner JA noted that, \\"The appellant was entitled to delivery of the house in a state not materially different from that in which it was at the date of the contract.\\"846.  In accordance with specifications  The rules regarding this element are protean. The following discussion considers only two facets. First, it should be pointed out that, where sales are concluded by sample,A sample of what is to be supplied is shown to the prospective purchaser, and the contract is concluded upon that basis. such a contract contains an express warranty that the bulk of the goods conform to the sample. If the final consignment does not comply, the warranty is breached, and the buyer has an actio empti, and a full range of contractual remedies, including (where appropriate) a claim for damages.Kerr 18.Norman 214. Secondly, as Volpe puts it, \\"The seller may not make available more or less than the amount stated in the contract, nor the contract goods mixed with others of a different description.\\"A Student's Guide to the Law of Purchase and Sale 75. In Cedarmount Store v Webster & Co,1922 TPD 106. Wessels JP held, > According to our law [...] a contract to deliver at one and the same time a > number of articles of a particular quality is prima facie an entire > contract, and the seller has no right to alter the nature of the contract. > ASi in emptione modus dictus est et non-praestatur ex emptio actus est.D > 19.1.2. It is based upon the principle that a creditor cannot be compelled > to accept a partial payment or a part performance of a contract. Although > the subject matter of the contract is physically capable of division, yet > from the legal point of view the obligation is a payment of the entire sum > due or a number to be delivered [....] There is no duty cast upon a > purchaser to separate the bad part of a consignment from that of the good. > As soon as he satisfies himself that out of a large number of bags there is > an unreasonable number defective, he is, prima facie, entitled to reject the > lot.\\"109. There is some dispute about the powers of a purchaser with regard to violations of this requirement.Mannix v Osborn 1921 OPD 138.Wepener Ko-op v B Bremer & Co 1925 OPD 61.Kerr Sale and Lease 167.s 19(8) of the Consumer Protection Act.  With all accessories, appurtenances and fruits  Mackeurtan defines these words as follows: * Accessories \\"are those things which, though capable in the abstract of separate conception, in fact form an integral portion of the principal thing, and lose their individual existence.\\" He gives the following examples of accessories: anything that springs organically from an object (trees, etc.), and anything attached to the principal thing in a permanent manner (buildings on land, an arm on a statue, etc.).60. Accessories are identifiable by the nature of the thing, the way they are attached to the principal object, and the intention of the one who attached it. * Appurtenances \\"are its auxiliaries, which are not absolutely identified with it, but share its destiny, legal conditions and relations.\\"60. They are naturally adapted to serve and augment permanently the utility of the principal thing.Goudsmit Pandecten-Systeem para 44. Examples would be the keys to a chest, the sheath of a sword or the bottle containing liquor. * The seller must also make the thing sold available with any fruits accrued to it since the sale was perfecta. The important date is that on which the benefit passes. Natural fruits include all natural products of the thing, including anything extracted from it (crops from land sold, for example), while civil fruits refer to any pecuniary advantage that accrues to the thing (for example, interest and rents).De Kock and Another v Fincham (1902) 19 SC 136.  Vacua possessio  This obligation means, first, that the seller must make the thing available in such a manner that no-one is alleging any immediate right of possession over the res. In other words, at the time the thing is made available, the buyer must acquire free and undisturbed possession.Abdulla v Long 1931 CPD 305. Secondly, it means that the seller must make available the thing sold in such a way that no-one in future can establish a superior legal right to the thing against the buyer. This particular part of the seller's obligation involves the warranty against eviction.  Whatever is necessary to make the thing sold available  This obligation may be subdivided into a number of duties. Where the res vendita comprises unascertained goods, the seller must appropriate them to the contract and ensure that the quantity and description and quality of the goods thus appropriated are in accordance with the terms of the contract. If anything has to be done to the res vendita to put it in a deliverable state, the seller is responsible for doing so at his own expense.Stephen Fraser and Co v Clydesdale Collieries 1903 TH 121. The seller must, if the buyer requires this, give the latter reasonable opportunity to examine the thing prior to acceptance.Kahn v Robert 1921 CPD 654. The seller must give notice to the buyer of the fact that the thing is available, if the buyer cannot reasonably be expected to appropriate the thing without such notice.Levinson v Nel 1921 NPD 79.  Buyer's remedies  Mackeurtan writes, > The seller of goods may be in default as regards his duty to deliver, either > by not delivering at all, or by delivering goods other than, or more or less > than, those bought, or because he has tendered the goods at an improper time > or place. He may have repudiated his obligations. He may have broken his > warranty against eviction, or his obligation to take care of the goods until > delivery [....] These are clearly breaches of contract for which the buyer's > remedies are contractual.\\"102. The nature of remedies for breach of this residual duty are particularly detailed and complex. A brief summary is given here, based on Kerr's discussion.Sale and Lease 167ff.A detailed analysis of all the details may be found in Volpe A Student's Guide to the Law of Purchase and Sale 84‚Äì97. = Specific performance = The buyer has a right to demand the thing sold to him (subject, of course, to the court's discretion to refuse it). The remedy is available to a buyer who rejects the tender of goods as being inappropriate. As we have seen, a buyer, having received less than what he contracted to receive, may prefer to accept what was tendered, but sue for the balance to be produced.Cedarmount.Mannix. = Cancellation = Failure to make the goods available in a contract of sale is a major breach. It entitles the buyer to cancel the contract. In Landau v City Auction Mart,1940 AD 284. Watermeyer JA said, > I can find nothing in Roman-Dutch law which stands in the way of an order > being made in favour of a purchaser for cancellation of a contract of sale > and repayment of the price by reason of a refusal by the defendant to > deliver the property sold.294. = Damages = If the seller fails to make the goods available, damages may be awarded (with or without cancellation, depending on the circumstances and type of breach), according to the general principles of contract. = Seller's duty to transfer ownership = The seller has a duty to transfer ownership if he has it, or can obtain it, failing which, his duty is to warrant the buyer against eviction.  Transfer of ownership  The seller, as noted before, need not be the owner of the thing he is selling. In most circumstances, he is, though, and is therefore obliged to transfer ownership. This duty, although seeming to amount to common sense, has been a source of some debate in South African law. In particular, uncertainty has been caused by statements made by Wessels JA in the case of Kleynhans Brothers v Wessels Trustee.1927 AD 271. This debateSee Kerr Sale and Lease 177ff. is considered in due course. Should a seller mala fide fail to transfer ownership, the buyer has an action ex empto for transfer of ownership, as soon as he discovers the true position.  Warranty against eviction  Again, the seller is normally the owner of the property. He is expected to transfer this ownership as part of the sale. What happens, however, in the situation where someone bona fide believes he is the owner of the thing he is selling, but in fact is not? Such sales are, of course, valid, but ever since Roman days the law has said that a person who buys and takes possession of property from such a seller has no action unless and until he is threatened with eviction by someone with better legal title to the property (usually the true owner). The action arises in such circumstances out of what is known as the warranty against eviction. The warranty requires of the seller that he do whatever is legally possible to protect the buyer in his possession of the res vendita. An inability to do so renders him liable under this warranty. The warranty is obliquely re-articulated in the Consumer Protection Act.s 44(1)(d). Three basic requirements must be met before the seller becomes liable on the buyer's eviction: # Eviction # Notice # Determined defence = Eviction = Voet states, \\"Eviction is the recovery by judicial process of our property, which the opponent has acquired by iustus titulus.\\"21.2.1. In present times the word has a much wider connotation than that given in Voet's definition. It means any lawful interference with vacua possessio, by seller or third party. In Norman's Purchase and Sale, it is said that eviction > thus includes a demand on the part of a third person to hand over the > property sold to him if the purchaser is unable to resist such a claim; the > refusal of the person in possession of the property to relinquish it to the > purchaser; the demand for payment of a sum of money by the purchaser in > order to retain the whole or portion of the res vendita; and conceivably the > existence of a concealed servitude over the property which interferes with > the use and possession of the property. In short anything which weakens the > purchaser's right to the whole or a portion of the thing sold, or which > constitutes a menace to his right of having free and undisturbed > possession.288. The seller is not liable for any unlawful interference with the buyer's possession. Liability only arises if the interference is the result of a flaw in the seller's title. The flaw must have existed at the time of sale or, if it arose subsequently to the sale, be due to the seller's own act. Eviction, therefore, does not include situations where the sale is set aside by the court, or if the property is attached by the seller's creditors before ownership passed. The warranty begins to operate as soon as the buyer's vacua possessio is threatened. \\"The idea of eviction,\\" writes Volpe, \\"has also been extended to cater for successive sales: the repayment of the purchase price to the purchaser who has been evicted is equated in that situation with the seller's own eviction and serves as such when the seller looks next to the one from whom he himself bought.\\"100. Thus Kerr writes, \\"The facts of Olivier v Van der Bergh1956 (1) SA 802 (C). [...] and Louis Botha Motors v James Slabbert Motors1983 (3) SA 793 (A). [...] show that it is not uncommon for A to sell to B and B to C (possession being transferred in both cases) before the true owner makes his claim. These decisions show that once a claim has been made against C and he has surrendered the thing sold, whether after judgment or because he can show that the claimant has an unassailable right he may claim compensation from B and B may claim from A. C may not, in the absence of cession, claim direct from A.\\"194.See Westeel Engineering (Pty) Ltd v Sydney Clow and Co Ltd 1968 (3) SA 458 (T). In cases where there has been a string of successive sales, however, intermediate parties who have bought and then sold goods on to other parties do have the locus standi to bring proceedings to determine whether the person claiming a right to the property has a legitimate right to do so.See Concordiant Trading CC v Daimler Chrysler Financial Services (Pty) Ltd 2005 (6) SA 205 (SCA), overruling a contrary decision in Concordiant Trading CC v Daimler Chrysler Financial Services (Pty) Ltd 2005 (4) SA 389 (D). The action on the warranty also arises where the res vendita or part of it is in the possession of a third party, and the buyer is unable to obtain it.Schultz v Roodepoort Venture Syndicate 1905 TH 356. = Notice = As soon as eviction is threatened, the buyer is required to give the seller notice of the third party's claim to possession of the thing. The seller has to be given adequate notice to fulfil his obligation to protect the buyer's possession. The duties of the seller are somewhat unclear, but it seems that he is expected to intervene in the action, and take up the defence against the other party claiming title. It is the seller's duty under the warranty to relieve the buyer of the risks and costs of court action. If the buyer fails to give the necessary notice, he has no recourse against the seller unless he can prove that the third party's right is incontestable, or that it is the seller's fault that the notice did not reach him in time. The buyer is relieved of this duty when: * The title of the third party claiming the thing is legally unassailable; * The parties have expressly agreed that notice is not required * Notice is not given owing to the seller's own faultFor example, he may have absented himself to prevent his receiving notice. * The seller has sold property mala fide, in which case the seller is liable for fraud in terms of the actio ex emptoThis has been dealt with above. = Determined defence = The buyer, faced with eviction, is required in most circumstances to put up a determined defence (virilis defensio) of his possession, unless he can prove that the claimant's title was legally unassailable. This must be done when the seller has failed to assist the buyer, either because he cannot be found, or because he refused to assist.Lammers and Lammers v Giovannoni 1955 (3) SA 385 (A).G√∂bel Franchises CC v Kawda 2007 (5) SA 456 (C).  The buyer's remedies  Kerr states that a buyer claiming under the warranty is entitled to repayment of the purchase price (or whatever portion has been paid) and, if loss over and above the amount can be shown, compensation for such loss.Sale and Lease 197.Alpha Trust (Pty) Ltd v Van der Watt 1975 (3) SA 734 (A) 748G. The action is a contractual one, which is sued for by means of the actio empti. Being a bona fide possessor, the buyer could also claim for any improvements made to the property, this from the true owner. Where eviction is partial only, and insufficient to entitle the buyer to claim rescission, he is entitled to claim the difference between the value of the property at eviction and the value of what is left to him. It is important to remember that the warranty is residual. One may contract out of it, if this is possible.For the effect of this, see Vrystaat Motors v Henry Blignaut (Edms) Bpk 1996 (2) SA 448 (A). = Duty to make res vendita available free from defects = The seller is required to make the thing sold available without defects or diseases. Where the seller makes the res available with a defect, a number of considerations determine the nature and extent of the remedy available to the buyer. In any defect case, one needs to consider two critical things: # the nature of the defect (whether it is a patent or a latent defect); and # the nature of the remedy. In certain circumstances, the buyer's remedy is clearly contractual (enforceable in terms of the actio empti). In other circumstances, the remedies are not contractual; they find their roots in the aedilitian actions of Roman law. The extent of relief available differs, depending upon which remedy applies. Historically, contractual actions entitle the buyer to consequential damages, while the aedilitian remedies do not. While some decisions do not specify which remedy is referred to, the differences in the nature of the remedies remain important.  Patent defects  Patent defects are defects obvious to the naked eye: easily discoverable by the buyer at the time the goods are received. An example would be a scab on a sheep. Where specific goods are identified, or unascertained goods are appropriated by the seller to the contract, and the goods suffer from a patent defect, the seller may be sued for breach of contract by defective performance.Kroomer v Hess & Co 1919 AD 204. The remedies are therefore contractual; consequential damages may be claimed. Where the buyer has inspected the res vendita at (or before) the time of sale, and the inspection ought to have disclosed a defect, and the buyer accepts the goods without objection, the seller is not liable provided he has not warranted (expressly or impliedly) the absence of the defect, nor fraudulently concealed it. The reasoning behind this rule is that the buyer has waived his remedies by his conduct. He is deemed to have bought the goods subject to the defect, which he ought to have discovered.Muller v Hobbs (1904) 21 SC 669.  Latent defects  In Holmdene Brickworks (Pty) Ltd v Roberts Construction Co Ltd1977 (3) SA 670 (A). Corbett JA defined a latent defect as follows: > Broadly speaking in this context a latent defect may be described as an > abnormal quality or attribute which destroys or substantially impairs the > utility or effectiveness of the res vendita for the purpose for which it was > sold or for which it is commonly used [....] Such a defect is latent when it > is one which is not visible or discoverable upon an inspection of the res > vendita.\\"683. In other words, a latent defect would not be apparent to an ordinary person, even if an expert might have discovered it. Where the seller makes the thing sold available, and it is discovered that the thing has a latent defect, the seller is liable to the buyer in four circumstances. It is important to note that the first three categories allow an aggrieved party a contractual remedy: that is, an actio empti, which includes a claim for consequential loss or id quod interesse. The fourth category provides for aedilitian relief. The four categories are: # where the seller has acted fraudulently, or mala fide; # where the seller has warranted the absence of a latent defect; # where the seller is an artifex, manufacturer or seller, or is a dealer professing attributes of skill and expert knowledge in relation to the thing; and # where the aedilitian actions are available. = Fraud = Regarding mala fides on the part of the seller, Glaston House (Pty) Ltd v Inag (Pty) Ltd.1977 (2) SA 846 (A). = Warranty = Where the seller has given an express or implied warranty against the existence of the defect, or has warranted the fitness of the res vendita for the purpose for which it is bought, the seller is liable.Minister van Landbou-Techniese Dienste v Scholtz 1971 (3) SA 188 (A).s 56 of the Consumer Protection Act. The action is contractual. The case provides a useful distinction between contractual and aedilitian remedies for latent defects. = Skill and expert knowledge = The leading cases are Kroonstad Westelike Boere Ko-operatiewe Vereeninging v Botha and Another,1964 (3) SA 561 (A). Holmdene Brickworks, Sentrachem Bpk v Weinhold,1995 (4) SA 312 (A). Langeberg Voedsel Bpk v Sarculum Boerdery Bpk,1996 (2) SA 565 (A). Sentrachem Ltd v Prinsloo1997 (2) SA 1 (A). Ciba-Geigy (Pty) Ltd v Lushof Farms (Pty) Ltd2002 (2) SA 447 (SCA) 465. and D&H; Piping Systems (Pty) Ltd v Trans Hex Group Ltd2006 (3) SA 593 (SCA). See also section 61 of the Consumer Protection Act. = Aedilitian actions = A seller is also liable for latent defects in the merx in terms of the aedilitian actions. The curule aediles were the Roman magistrates in charge of markets and public works. They had the power to issue edicts. Their most famous edict concerned a seller's liability for latent defects. Ulpian said, > Labeo writes that the edict of the curule aediles applies as well to sales > of land as to sales of chattels inanimate or animate. The aediles say: > \\"Sellers of slaves are to inform buyers of any disease (morbus) or defect > (vitium) in any slave and whether any slave is a runaway, a vagabond, or not > free from noxal liability; all these matters they must declare with proper > publicity when the slave shall be sold. But if a slave was sold in > contravention of the foregoing or in contravention of what was stated or > promised when he was being sold [...] we grant to the buyer [...] an action > for redhibition of the slave [....] The motive for the proposition of this > edict is to defeat the artifices of sellers and to assist buyers whenever > they are cheated by sellers. It is however, to be understood that a seller, > even though he was unaware of the existence of faults [...] must > nevertheless be held liable. Nor is this unfair, for the seller was in a > position to inform himself on these matters, while to the buyer it makes no > difference as to whether his deception is due to the seller's ignorance or > guile.D 21.1.1, 2 (De Zulueta's translation). The seller's obligations and the buyer's rights in terms of the aedilitian actions arise ex lege by operation of law, not with reference to the contract itself. One must not refer to an implied warranty against defects being present.Kerr Sale and Lease 219. The aedilitian actions are the actio redhibitoria and the actio quanti minoris, both of which are available in South African law. Each action provides the aggrieved buyer with certain specific remedies. Each has some similar elements: The actions are available (in the case of defects) * if at the time of the sale the thing suffers from a disease or defect; and * if it was sold \\"in contravention of the edict\\" (adversus ea); in other words, if there has been non-disclosure of the defect or disease.  Defects and diseases  This matter is canvassed by Kerr.See Sale and Lease 116ff. There is little need, then, to detail it here. As far as defects are concerned, Corbett JA's words in Holmdene still apply. The remedies lie only if the disease or defect existed at the time of sale.Seboko v Soll 1949 (3) SA 337 (T).Witon Chemicals (Pty) Ltd v Rebuff (Pty) Ltd [2002] 4 All SA 232 (T). Kerr says, > Aedilitian actions do not lie if the thing sold was sound at the time of the > sale although it had suffered previously from a disease or defect. It is > important that it should be wholly sound, not merely a defective part that > should have been repaired or replaced [....] Just as the actions do not lie > if the thing, having previously been diseased or defective is sound at the > time of sale, so also they do not lie if the thing was sound at the time of > sale but became diseased and defective thereafter.Sale and Lease 114‚Äì115. The existence of the disease or defect at the time of the sale is a question of fact that the buyer must prove on the balance of probabilities. An inference that the disease or defect existed at the time of sale may be drawn from the fact that the disease or defect manifests itself shortly after the sale. Obviously the buyer does not have to prove that the defect was apparent at the time of sale. Where the subject matter of the sale is a class of goods (bags of maize, for example, or pockets of oranges), the aedilitian remedies apply. Yet the extent to which the buyer is entitled to redhibition is determined by whether the contract was divisible or indivisible. Mackeurtan states: \\"The redhibition to which the purchaser is entitled extends only to the affected articles, unless the contract may properly be regarded as an indivisible one for the sale of the articles as a whole.\\"139.  Adversus ea  The seller must sell the property in contravention of the edict; in other words, must defy the requirements of the edict by failing to disclose the existence of the defect. The ordinary rules of non-disclosure apply here, but the facts of the case determine which of the two actions is appropriate. The actio redhibitoria is an action for the cancellation of the contract and restitution.Van Zyl v Credit Corporation of SA Ltd 1960 (4) SA 582 (A) at 589‚Äì90. It involves the restoration of the parties (buyer and seller) to their original positions, as far as this is possible. One is not entitled to a claim for one's consequential loss (id quod interesse) in terms of this remedy. The test to determine whether the buyer is entitled to redhibition is objective. In Reid Brothers v Bosch,1914 TPD 578. the test was expressed in two ways: # A buyer is entitled to rescission of the contract if the defect is of such a nature as to render the article completely unfit for the purpose for which it was bought (for everyone, not just the specific buyer). # A reasonable buyer would not have bought it at all had he known of the defect. In other words, the defect must be material if it is to justify redhibition.An example of a case where the defect did not justify rescission is Dibley v Furter 1951 (4) SA 73 (C). Whether the buyer is entitled to redhibitory or quanti minoris relief depends, therefore, on the seriousness of the defect. The defect must not be merely trifling‚Äîit must hinder or prevent the usefulness or serviceability of the thing‚Äîif it is to justify complete redhibition. If redhibition is applicable, the buyer is entitled to a refund of the purchase price, plus interest, and of course reimbursement for useful or necessary improvements made to the res. The buyer is obliged, however, to inform the seller of the defect, and to tender a return of the thing (plus accessories, appurtenances and fruits). The buyer's right to redhibitory relief is terminated in the following circumstances: * where he uses the article in such a way as to make it impossible to return it to the seller; * where it has been destroyed or damaged materially due to the buyer's negligence; * where the buyer fails to discover the defect and to return the thing within a reasonable time after the discovery of the defect (or the time when the defect should reasonably have been discovered); and * where the buyer, knowing of the defect, exercises rights of ownership over the article (for example, where he arranges to have it repaired). Where the article has been destroyed as a result of the defect itself, or in the course of its normal use, or accidentally, the buyer is still entitled to redhibitory relief.Feinstein v Niggli 1981 (2) SA 684 (A).Hall Thermotank Natal (Pty) Ltd v Hardman 1968 (4) SA 818 (D).Marks Ltd v Laughton 1920 AD 12. The actio quanti minoris (also known as the actio aestimatoria) is the other action to be considered here: an action for the return of a portion of the purchase price.Davenport Corner Tearoom (Pty) Ltd v Joubert 1962 (2) SA 709 (D) at 714B-D. The actio quanti minoris may be sought as a remedy in two circumstances. In the first instance, the basic requirements for an actio redhibitoria are the same as those that give rise to the actio quanti minoris. Wherever such circumstances are present as justify complete redhibition, the buyer has an election to choose which of the two actions he prefers. If he has this choice, he may * restore the thing and claim the price paid; or * retain the thing and reclaim part of the purchase price. The actio quanti minoris may also be sought in a second set of circumstances. Where the defect is of such a character that it is not material enough to give rise to a redhibitory action, it may nevertheless give rise to an actio quanti minoris. A buyer may therefore claim a reduction in the purchase price if (despite the defect) he would still have entered into the contract, but at a lower price. A buyer may sue for a redhibitory action, claiming quanti minoris damages in the alternative. When the actio quanti minoris is used, the buyer, if successful, is entitled to the return of a portion of the purchase price.Douglas v Dersley 1917 EDL 221. The actual amount is calculated on the basis of the difference between the purchase price and the actual value of the thing sold. The calculation of the award in current South African law is different from that of Roman law, where the amount awarded would be calculated on the basis of the difference between the price actually given and the price the purchaser would have paid if he had known of the defect. It is, in other words, a subjective test. In South African law, the measure of relief is usually the difference between the actual purchase price and the value of the article in its defective state.SA Oil and Fat Industries Ltd v Park Rynie Whaling Co Ltd 1916 AD 400 at 413. The value of the defective thing must be ascertained as it is in the case of failure to make available the thing sold: by reference to the market price, if there is one. If no market price can be established, the best evidence available must be used to establish the actual value of the thing sold. Another means of assessing the amount recoverable is by referring to the cost of repairing the defect that existed at the time of sale and/or remedying any deterioration that might have occurred as a result of the defect. Only reasonable costs of repair may be taken into account in this regard.Maennel v Garage Continental Ltd 1910 AD 137 at 149. A measure of controversy exists as to the date to be used when determining the actual value of the thing sold. After considering the cases, Kerr comes to the conclusion that the relevant date is the date when the sale took place.Sale and Lease 131‚Äì133. Where the sale involves a res vendita, consisting of a number of articles, and one or more of them is defective, the quanti minoris relief exists only in respect of the defective articles. If the sale is indivisible, however, the buyer is entitled to relief only if a valuation of all the articles, both defective and sound, clearly shows that he has received less than he has contracted for. The right to claim quanti minoris damages is lost where the buyer, knowing of the defect, accepts the article as satisfactory in terms of the contract.  The aedilitian remedies as defences  Circumstances that entitle the buyer to redhibition, or to a reduction of the purchase price, entitles him to defend, on the basis of these facts, actions for payment of the purchase price, or any other action arising out of the contract. When the buyer is sued by the seller, therefore, he is entitled to deny liability and claim redhibitory relief as a defence if the defect is material. The same rules apply as above. This is known as the exceptio redhibitoria. Circumstances that give cause for an actio quanti minoris may also be used as a defence to an action for the price by the seller. This is called the exceptio quanti minoris.Douglas v Dersley.Zieve v Verster & Co 1918 CPD 296.  Exclusion of liability for defects  The following are circumstances in which the seller is not liable for latent defects in the res vendita: # where, in terms of the contract, the seller expressly excludes liability (where, that is, he sells voetstoots); # where the seller's liability is impliedly excluded in terms of the contract; # where the defect arose after the date of sale; # where the buyer knew of the defect at the time of sale, or, having become aware of it later, expressly or impliedly accepts the position (thus waiving his remedies); # where the remedy has expired (for example, by prescription); and # where aedilitian remedies are not available to buyers in respect of goods sold at judicial sales in execution. The only of these circumstances to be examined in detail here is the first. It is competent for the parties to agree that the seller shall not be liable for the presence of diseases or defects. The most famous example is the voetstoots clause. Where the thing is sold voetstoots, it is sold \\"with all its faults\\" or \\"as it stands\\" or \\"as it is.\\" The term must expressly form part of the contract; it cannot be implied. The effect of such a sale is that the seller is not liable for defects in the res vendita. Where there is an inspection of the thing by an expert, this does not necessarily make the sale voetstoots. It is important to note, however, that the voetstoots clause affects only the presence of latent diseases and defects; it does not cover the situation where a misrepresentation of any kind is made.Schmidt v Dwyer 1959 (3) SA 986 (C). One big exception attaches to the voetstoots clause. A voetstoots clause does not relieve the seller of responsibility for a defective res vendita when the seller has acted fraudulently, since no-one can contract out of fraud. There has been some polemic between the Natal courts, and those in the Transvaal and the Cape, as to what is meant by fraud in this context. Following a note by Milne,1948 SALJ 532. the Natal courts took the view that a seller who knew of the defect, and yet sold voetstoots, was not fraudulent unless he designedly concealed the defect from the purchaser. The Cape and Transvaal courts, however, held that knowledge of the defect coupled with a voetstoots clause was in itself sufficient to render the seller fraudulent. These difficulties were finally cleared up by the Appellate Division in Van der Merwe v Meades.1991 (2) SA 1 (A). The latest case on the point is Odendaal v Ferraris.2009 4 SA 313 (SCA). There is also some debate about the effect of the Consumer Protection Act on the voetstoots clause. Where there is an express term of the contract in apparent conflict with a voetstoots clause, a question arises as to whether the buyer has an action against the seller. The answer depends on the ambit of the term in the circumstances. If the term extends beyond the field of aedilitian liability, the voetstoots clause may not assist the seller. For example, a second-hand car is sold, the seller having guaranteed that the car has a new camshaft, and the car is sold voetstoots. If the seller delivers the car with a new camshaft, he is not liable for latent defects in that new camshaft. If the camshaft is not new, however, the buyer has the usual remedies for breach of contract, which have nothing to do with aedilitian remedies. National Credit ActAct 34 of 2005. excludes the possibility of a valid voetstoots clause in a sale subject to that Act.s 90(2)(g).  Dicta et promissa  The Romans recognised that, where a seller made a statement amounting to a dictum et promissum, and where the res vendita did not measure up to that statement, the buyer was entitled to aedilitian relief.See the passage quoted from D 21.1.1 earlier. In such cases, there is no latent defect; the problem comes in that the concept of the thing created in the buyer's mind by the seller's dictum et promissum is different from the true character of the thing. These remedies are relevant where a representation is made, but it falls short of a contractual warranty. In South African law, despite any distinctions between dicta and promissa in the Roman law, the term refers to, \\"a statement or undertaking or promise by the seller which was intended to be acted upon by the parties.\\"Hall v Milner 1959 (2) SA 304 (O). The leading case on dictum promissumve is Phame (Pty) Ltd v Paizes,1973 (3) SA 397 (A). Holmes JA posed one of the questions raised by the case in the following way: \\"Can an innocent misrepresentation ever entitle a buyer to a reduction of the price under the actio quanti minoris? [...] If so, under what circumstances? In other words, what factual foundation is required?\\"407. The answer, as he saw it, was this: > What has to be considered is not innocent misrepresentation per se, but the > dictum et promissum of the Roman-Dutch law and the consequential aedilitian > relief [....] It is both unnecessary and confusing to try to fit a dictum et > promissum into some modern juristic niche like a warranty or term; and then > to draw conclusions therefrom as to the buyer's rights. The Roman-Dutch > authorities in particular do not require this.416. Those authorities he described as \\"simple and clear\\" on the point: > If there is a latent defect, at the time of sale, ipso facto the aedilitian > remedy is available (unless excluded by agreement). The seller's obligation > and the buyer's right arise by operation of law, and not by reference to the > intention of the parties [....] Similarly, if during the negotiations the > seller made a dictum et promissum bearing on the quality of the res vendita > and it falls short of it ipso facto the aedilitian remedy is available, by > operation of law.417. In summary, \\"on a conspectus of all the [...] authorities, decisions and discussions,\\" he considered the law in South Africa on this question to be as follows: # \\"The aedilitian remedies [...] are available if the res vendita suffered from a latent defect at the time of the sale.\\" # \\"The aedilitian remedies are also available if the seller made a dictum et promissum to the buyer on the faith of which the buyer entered into the contract or agreed to the price in question; and it turned out to be unfounded.\\" # A dictum et promissum is a material statement made by the seller to the buyer during the negotiations, bearing on the quality of the res vendita and going beyond mere praise and commendation.\\" # \\"Whether a statement by the seller goes beyond mere praise and commendation depends on the circumstances of each case. Relevant considerations could include the following: whether the statement was made in answer to a question from the buyer; its materiality to the known purpose for which the buyer was interested in purchasing; whether the statement was one of fact or of personal opinion; and whether it would be obvious even to the gullible that the seller was merely singing the praises of his wares, as sellers have ever been wont to do.\\"417‚Äì418. Point 4 above makes it quite clear that a mere puff does not amount to a dictum et promissum. See also Gannet Manufacturing Co (Pty) Ltd v Postaflex (Pty) Ltd.1981 (3) SA 216 (C).  Buyer's residual obligations = Payment of purchase price = Manner of payment  The buyer is required to pay the purchase price in the manner agreed upon in the contract. This is certainly his most important duty. Should the contract say nothing specific in this regard, the obligation must be established in terms of the previous course of dealings between the parties, or by relevant trade usage. Failing these, as Mackeurtan notes, \\"he must pay it in legal tender.\\"199.See s 17 of the SA Reserve Bank Act 90 of 1989. Payment may be made by cheque, depending upon its being honoured. Performance other than of what is due (called substituted performance, or datio in solutum) may be rendered if the creditor consents; if he does consent, and the payment is so rendered, the obligation is validly discharged.  Time of payment = Cash sales = In the absence of agreement to the contrary, both parties are obliged to perform as soon as the contract is entered into. The buyer must tender payment, therefore, when the seller is bound to make available the thing sold. In Breytenbach v Van Wyk,1923 AD 541. Wessels JA said, \\"In a sale for cash the article must be delivered pari passu with the payment of the purchase price.\\"546. = Credit sales = A particular day may be agreed upon for payment; if not, payment must be made within a reasonable time. Where delivery by instalments is agreed upon, the buyer is prima facie required to pay the correct portion of the price on delivery of each instalment.  Place of payment  The buyer is required to pay the price at the place fixed in the contract. Where no place has been fixed, the buyer is required to ensure that payment reaches the creditor on or before the due date.  Payment by whom?  In ordinary circumstances the buyer is responsible for the price, but payment by a third party (either on behalf of the debtor, or as surety or co-debtor) also discharges the obligation. = Removal or receipt = The buyer has a duty to remove the thing when it is made available by the seller, or to receive it if it is brought to him.Gilson v Payne (1899) 16 SC 286. The classic statement of this duty is that of Pomponius: \\"If a man buys the stone on an estate and refuses to remove it, an action on sale may be brought to enforce removal.\\"D 19.1.9. Where a buyer fails to remove or receive the thing timeously, he is in mora. This has implications for the burden of the riskSee above. and entitles the seller to reimbursement for necessary expenditure in the upkeep and storage of the res vendita. = Reimbursement of necessary expenses = The buyer is required to reimburse the seller for any expenses necessarily incurred in caring for the res vendita between the date of sale and the seller's making the thing available. This duty corresponds to the seller's duty to take due care of the thing until it is made available; it also corresponds with his duty to account to the buyer for fruits of the res vendita from the date of sale. Examples of this type of expenses include the cost of warehousing, necessary repairs, taxes, maintenance and keep (the cost of a nightwatchman, for example, to ensure the safety of the res vendita), or monies spent on the veterinary treatment of an animal. = Seller's remedies = The seller's remedies where the buyer fails to fulfil one or more of these obligations are numerous and detailed.See Mackeurtan at 208‚Äì240.  Sales subject to statutory requirements  Various statutes regulate the way certain common forms of sale contracts must be concluded and performed.See generally Norman's Purchase and Sale chapter 7. These statutes provide a gloss (and, in some cases, a significant alteration) to the common law of sale discussed thus far. For the most part, these pieces of legislation are designed with consumer protection in mind. They impose formalities upon contracts, and they stipulate what sorts of terms are lawful or unlawful. The following are significant pieces of legislation: * the Alienation of Land Act,Act 68 of 1981. which requires contracts for the sale of land to be in writing and signed, and imposes various other formalities on such contracts.For a thorough review of this legislation, see the entry on the law of conveyancing in South Africa; * the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act,Act 25 of 2002. which imposes strict consumer protection measures on such contracts, and regulates contractual terms attached to such contracts, especially in Chapter 7 of the Act; * the Insolvency Act,Act 24 of 1936. requires that, where sales of businesses are to occur, certain notices be published to ensure the validity of the sale;See the entry on the law of insolvency in South Africa for more details. * the Second-Hand Goods Act,Act 23 of 1955. which requires certain formalities if goods are to be bought and sold on a second-hand basis;For the future, a new Second-Hand Goods Act 6 of 2009 is in the pipeline. It was passed into law at the end of March 2009. Like so many pieces of commercial legislation, however, its commencement date is \\"yet to be proclaimed.\\" * the Stock-Theft Act,Act 57 of 1959. which regulates the sale of stock; * the National Credit Act; and * the Consumer Protection Act, which was signed into law on 24 April 2009, and which came into force on 31 March 2011.The Regulations were only published in December 2010. They are to be read together with the Act.Para 129 of the new version of LAWSA on Sale (published August 2010).

In 1959 he joined Valle's as the manager of one of the firm's steakhouses in his home town of Kittery, Maine. Donald Valle appointed him vice president one year later and by 1963 he had been elevated to executive vice president for operations where he was responsible for development, logistics, staffing and training. Hanson remained in control of the company until its closure in 1991. Following the closure, Hanson moved to Aventura, Florida where he worked in the real estate business until his retirement in 2012.

In a 1965 interview with the Boston Globe Richard Valle showed off a $50,000 automatic dishwashing machine located in the kitchen of the chain's new $1.5 million Braintree, Massachusetts, restaurant. Valle also pointed out the row of broilers and the large, in-house bakery that allowed the Braintree location to serve 5,000 customers a day. Donald Valle had a reputation as a tireless worker and expected the same level of effort from his employees. Once, when taking a group of restaurant owners through one of his steak houses, Valle pointed out how trim his workers were because they stayed so busy. When one of the visitors pointed to a heavy set employee, Valle joked \\"He's new. Come back in a couple of months and you will see he's slimmed down.\\"Haskell, David (October 17, 1969) \\"Shined Shoes, Now a Millionaire\\" Cumberland Evening Times, page 10 Valle's business model emphasized food over liquor with food accounting for over 85% of the company's revenues. \\"We haven't been in the business since 1933 from selling liquor but good food and good service.\\" Richard Valle said in a 1980 interview.  Early history and expansion  After operating a small cafe, Donald Valle purchased a larger restaurant in Portland, Maine and named it \\"Valle's Steak House\\" Valle's Steak House began as a 12-seat caf√© in Portland, Maine in 1933. The cafe was purchased at the end of Prohibition by Donald Valle. The cafe was successful and allowed Valle to purchase a larger restaurant in Portland and then a nightclub in Scarborough, Maine which he then converted into a restaurant. Valle next expanded to Kittery, Maine where he constructed his first restaurant that was custom designed as a steak house. In the mid-1960s Valle expanded to Massachusetts where he established three Boston-area steak houses in Saugus, Newton, and Braintree. They became, and remained, three of the busiest restaurants in the chain. In 1968 the company went public and its shares were listed on the American Stock Exchange. By 1969, Valle's was serving over 200,000 customers a week, had 1,300 employees on its payroll, and had created and issued over 6,000 of its own credit cards. By 1970 the company had expanded into Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York and was experiencing record earnings growth.\\"Valle's Sees Record Net, Peak Sales\\" (May 23, 1970) The Boston Globe, page 13 The success of the company attracted a buyout offer from the Campbell Soup Company. At the time of the offer, Valle's was operating 12 restaurants in Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York and had five additional restaurants being developed. For the financial period ending on March 31, 1970, Valle's had netted $1,448,000 on sales of $19,200,000. Campbell offered to purchase all of the company's assets and assume its liabilities for $38,900,000.Hammer, Alexander R. (October 13, 1970) \\"Campbell Seeking Valle's\\" The New York Times, page 65. Several months after the offer, negotiations collapsed.Smith, Gene (December 8, 1970) \\"Companies Take Merger Actions\\" The New York Times, page 71 In the wake of the collapse, Donald Valle stated that the level of control demanded by Campbell would have been detrimental to the continued success of the chain. Valle's Steak House headquarters was in Newton, Massachusetts In 1972, the company had begun construction on two additional steak houses in the Washington, D.C. area, plus another restaurant in Atlanta. Plans for restaurants in Yonkers, Philadelphia, Fort Lauderdale, and Daytona Beach had been approved and construction was slated to begin in 1973. Valle's had also agreed to sell a parcel of land next to its Hartford restaurant to a national motel chain for $325,000 and to serve as the hotel's sole banquet, lounge, and dining facility.\\"Quarterly Gains Listed By Valle's Steak House\\" (November 13, 1972) The Schenectady Gazette, page 42 One of the company's locations was in Saugus, Mass adjacent to the Hilltop Steakhouse that was, for a period of time, the highest grossing restaurant in the United States and often had a waiting time for a table that exceeded an hour. While the Valle's location in Saugus was successful, it was also mocked as \\"...the place to go when you couldn't get into the Hilltop.\\" The Braintree, Mass Valle's was the fifth restaurant in the chain to open and one of the busiest. On Thanksgiving Day 1979, the Braintree location \\"... prepared 1,200 pounds of turkey to serve to an expected 2,000 customers\\", for a holiday that was only their \\"... fifth busiest day of the year for the restaurant, behind Mother‚Äôs Day, Christmas, Easter, and New Year‚Äôs Day. Revenues and earnings continued to grow into the mid-70s but at a slower rate. Growing inflation, unemployment and rising gas prices caused Richard Valle to warn investors that although the company would continue to expand, earnings would not be able to maintain their momentum. \\"Inflation, the cautious attitude of the consumer, and the energy crisis are uncertainties facing the industry.\\" \\"Valle's\\" (July 31, 1974) The Boston Globe, page 12 By 1977 both revenues and profits had begun to decline.\\"Corporate Reports ‚Äì Valle's Steak House\\" (May 21, 1977) The Boston Globe, page 13  Economic challenges, declining sales, and closure  Donald Valle's death in 1977 saddled the Valle family with an estate tax bill it was not prepared to pay.\\"Valle Family Announces Plan to Sell Chain of Restaurants\\" (November 22, 1981) The Boston Globe, page 1 Combined with declining sales and increasing costs from the firm's continued expansion, in 1981 Richard and Judith Valle attempted to sell their controlling shares in the company to a group of non- family executives and private investors for $17,500,000. Two different proposals were provided to shareholders over a 24-month period. At the time of the proposed sale, the Valle family and its trusts owned 66.7% of the company's 2.5 million common stock shares outstanding. The company was operating 32 restaurants that despite generating $65,900,000 in sales, had lost $569,000 for the year ending on March 31, 1981.\\"Company News ‚Äì Valle Family Plans Steak Chain Sale\\" (November 24, 1981) The New York Times, page D4. During the effort to sell their shares, Richard Valle stepped aside as president of the company. In his place, Arthur W. Hanson, 54, formerly executive vice president of operations became president and also acquired the newly created title of chief executive officer. Richard Valle described the change as \\"the start of [a] regrouping\\" that would allow him to focus on the firm's long term strategy as the chairman.Mohl, Bruce A. (November 11, 1980) \\"Valle's Changes Managers\\" The Boston Globe, page 1 Prior to the finalization of the buyout, Valle's had already begun to close restaurants for this first time in its history. Among those that were closed was the Rochester, New York store that had opened in 1971 and had never turned a profit. The Valle's in Kittery, Maine was the first custom built restaurant in the Valle's Steak House chain and was among the last to close. After the buyout, the chain continued to sell off properties. Between 1982 and 1984 the company sold all of its Florida locations, none of which had been open for more than seven years.\\"Valle's Restaurant Sells for $1 million\\" (June 6, 1984) The Evening Independent (St. Petersburg, FL) page 14 By the mid-1980s some of the company's largest restaurants outside of Florida had also closed to include Fall River,\\"Valle's Steak House, opened in 1970 and demolished in 1984\\" (August 6, 2012) The Herald News (Fall River, Mass.)

Another important development in 1983 was Arthur Hanson creating the Polar Bear Restaurant Corporation headquartered in Needham, Mass as the parent corporation of the remaining restaurants. By agreement with Judith Valle, she was allowed to use the \\"Valle's Steak House\\" name for her Portland restaurant.\\"Polar Bear Restaurant Corporation\\" Bizapedia, retrieved February 23, 2012 \\"Correction\\" (December 31, 1991) Meridien Record-Journal (Meridien, Conn.), page 2 The last three Valle's Steak House restaurants operating as part of Hanson's corporation closed on Friday, December 27, 1991.

The Valle family was unable to pay the sizable inheritance taxes levied on the estate of Donald Valle when he died in 1977 and were forced to liquidate the business in order to meet their obligation to the government. In a June 2000 interview, Judith Valle said, \\"No matter how much business we did, we couldn't pay the government. We couldn't break even. It was a huge tax burden, with compounding interest.\\" Campbell Steve (June 9, 2000) \\"House to weigh repeal of federal 'death tax' Critics say the estate tax forces heirs of small businesses and farms to sell; supporters say repealing it will only help the rich\\" The Portland Press Herald, page 1a Susan Collins (R), the U.S. Senator from Maine subsequently used Valle's Steak House as an example of the adverse effects of federal tax policies and argued for revised federal laws that eased the burden of estate taxes, especially on family owned businesses.\\"Collins Lauds Law Easing Estate Tax\\" (August 6, 1997)The Portland Press Herald, page 3b Valle's sign outside of the Albany, New York restaurant. Photo courtesy of Saxton Signs, Castleton, New York. * Economic turbulence. The gas crisis, soaring inflation, and rising labor costs battered the chain from the mid-70s through the 1980s. Other companies in the restaurant industry, particularly those in a similar price niche to Valle's, also suffered from declining sales. In a July 1980 interview with the Boston Globe, Richard Valle said \\"The guy who went out twice a week now goes out once, and the retired senior citizen, a large proportion of the business, trades down in the items he orders.\\" Valle also cited the steady increases in the minimum wage as having a \\"... a ripple effect. If you pay your kitchen men $3.10, you have to give your cooks more money, the chef, the meat cutter, the baker, the hostess, the cashier.\\" Rising labor costs were exacerbated by the 1981 elimination of the \\"tip credit\\" which allowed restaurants to reduce the hourly wages of their wait staffs by a portion of the tip. As a result, Valle's was forced to repeatedly raise prices to offset the higher labor costs and predictably, customer counts dropped. * Obsolete business model. Working against Valle's attempt to maintain its revenues was the emphasis of food over liquor despite the fact that the sale of alcohol featured higher markups. Valle's also placed a strong emphasis on service and because of that shunned the self-service salad-bar concept that many restaurants had introduced to reduce labor costs. As energy costs increased, Valle's found the costs of maintaining their expansive restaurants with banquet rooms that seated up to 1,000 to be a burden. \\"People aren't having the big 300 to 500 person weddings anymore,\\" said Richard Valle in a 1980 interview. \\"Weddings are now more like 100 people [as are] the annual Christmas banquets that seated 500 to 900 or the big retirement party.\\" Richard Valle calculated the average size of the 280 banquets one restaurant booked in 1979 and it came to 77.5 people. Supporting the large restaurants were five acre parking areas that also contributed to the company's overhead costs. By the late 1970s, Richard Valle had designed a downsized restaurant that was less costly to staff, heat, light, and maintain and would need only two and a half acres of land. By then, the company's revenues had begun to deteriorate and Valle could not implement the new design. Valle's was also faulted for the straight line architecture of its large dining rooms that caused some critics to compare the restaurant to a cafeteria.Spinazzola, Anthony (July 31, 1975) \\"Let's Eat Out\\" The Boston Globe, page A-6 Other critics questioned the wisdom of using a regional New England menu in southern locations such as Atlanta where customers of the early 1970s were unfamiliar with clam chowder, baked stuffed lobsters, and New England-style pot roast.  Aftermath  Valle's Steak House was a landmark East Coast restaurant for decades and continues to be discussed in various articles and on blog sites.Chowhound \\"Search for Valles ...\\"\\"Steakhouses in Massachusetts in the 1970s?\\" Roadfood.comBarlette, Kristi Gustafson \\"Things I miss having in the Capital Region\\" Albany Times Union Artifacts from the chain are sold widely on eBay and other web sites. Since 1991, many of the Valle's restaurants have been razed or, in some cases, repurposed. The Andover location which was among the last to close, still stands and has been used as a comedy club and a bar and grill. As of 2013 it is a part of the Massachusetts-based Italian restaurant chain named \\"Chateau.\\" \\"The Last Laugh at Comedy Palace\\" The Braintree restaurant that was once the largest and one of the busiest in the chain subsequently became a \\"Hilltop Steakhouse\\" and served in that capacity until 2006 when it was torn down to make way for a Toyota dealership.\\"Largest Valle's Opens in Braintree\\" (May 8, 1964) The Boston Globe, page A4Collins, Rick (March 8, 2006) \\"Last roundup: Hilltop in Braintree to close; Famed eatery will make way for Toyota dealership\\" The Patriot Ledger, page 1 The location is remembered for then presidential candidate Ronald Reagan making a 1980 campaign speech at a South Shore Chamber of Commerce luncheon held in the restaurant's main banquet room.Tuoti, Gerard (June 11, 2004) \\"Ronald Reagan 1911-2004\\" The Patriot Ledger (Quincy, Mass), page 10.

An action for an order cancelling a sale, and for the refund of the purchase price, it was heard in the Eastern Districts Local Division by De Villiers J November 9, 10 and 11, 1954, with judgment handed down on December 9. The plaintiffs' attorneys were RG White, Gillett & McConnachie. The defendant's attorneys were Segal & Pincus. AW Back, QC (with him TM Mullins), appeared for the plaintiff; NC Addleson for the defendant The case concerned a contract for the sale of land, and a subsequent attempt to cancel it. The seller had sub-divided a residential area for business purposes. This the local council had approved, subject to a road service restriction. The administrator did not agree to rezoning, and the seller granted a road service restriction. The council imposed a building line restriction and refused to delete the road service condition. The deed had embodied both restrictions. The purchaser, prior in time, cancelled the sale, and the road service restriction fell away when the rezoning was refused. The court ruled that the council was not entitled to retain both restrictions. The seller was accordingly forced to pass transfer unrestricted, and the purchaser was entitled to reclaim the purchase price.  Facts  The defendant, the owner of a block of ground, had carried on a dairy business on a portion thereof. This business, with the land on which the buildings stood, together with another small portion, he had sold to the plaintiff. The defendant had undertaken to have the ground subdivided so as to give transfer of the land sold. He accordingly applied for a sub-divisional diagram for four lots, three of them to be accorded business rights. As a condition of approval and of these rights, the East London City Council had imposed a condition of a service road. The Administrator had, however, refused to agree to the rezoning of the three lots from residential to business purposes. The defendant then requested the Council to state its conditions in respect of two of the lots so as to enable transfer to be passed. In addition he applied for the existing use of the dairy on Lot 2 to be agreed to. The Council agreed to the latter but imposed a condition of a fifteen-foot building line: that is, a line forbidding the erection of any building or structure nearer than fifteen feet from the street forming the boundary of the lot. No mention was made of a service road. The defendant had in the meantime completed a notarial deed in favour of the Council creating a service road over Lot 2. The defendant, having regard to the imposition of the building line restriction, requested the Council to consent to the cancellation of the service road, which it refused to do. The defendant then caused a notarial deed to be redrafted embodying the fifteen-foot service road and the other conditions. Transfer of Lot 2 was then passed in favour of the plaintiff subject, inter alia, to the fifteen-foot building line and the service road. As the defendant refused to free the lot of the restriction relating to the service road, granted after the sale but before transfer, the plaintiff instituted proceedings cancelling the sale and sued for the return of the purchase price of the land and buildings plus the costs and expenses.  Argument  Counsel for the plaintiff contended that there were, at the date of sale, no encumbrances on the portion purchased; nor were any referred to in the deed. The plaintiff was therefore entitled to a clean transfer.Abdulla v Long 1931 CPD 305.Van Wyk v Currey NO 1907 TS 1109.Van der Westhuizen v Le Roux 1947 (3) SA 385.Aymard v Webster 1910 TPD 123. The plaintiff had not waived his right to a clean transfer. The onus of any waiver is on the defendant.Van Heerden v Pretorius 1914 AD at 76.Laws v Rutherford 1924 AD at 263. The plaintiff noted that, in this case, one and the same act constitutes a breach of two entirely separate obligations arising from the deed of sale, and the right of rescission is based on two different principles. The seller may not impose a servitude after the sale.Van Wyk v Currie. The buildings as provided in the agreement were not delivered inasmuch as one building lay entirely within the space imposed as a servitude of road: This, the plaintiff argued, would have to be removed. The plaintiff, then, had not obtained what he contracted for.Van Wyk v Currie.Jordaan & Vermeulen v Tack 1914 CPD 481. The plaintiff disputed the claim, as pleaded, that there had been any common intention, or a bona fide mutual error. Nor did any ground for rectification exist: To obtain rectification, the defendant must establish # a prior agreement or common intention that the term should be in the contract in the sense alleged; # a bona fide mutual error; and # a continuing common intention.Wessels Contract paras 979, 980, 1890-1893.Andrianatos v Caradas' Estate 1945 CPD 455.Bushby v Guardian Ass. Co. 1916 AD at 492.Meyer v Merchant's Trust 1942 AD 244.Banks v Cluver 1946 TPD 451 at 459. The agreement had been drawn up by the defendant. If there were any omissions or mistakes, the plaintiff contended, the defendant would be to blame.Wessels Contract.Goddard v Jeffreys 45 LT 674.Jennings v Jennings 77 LT 785.Rooke v Lord Kensington 69 ER 996.Rake v Hooper 83 LT 669. A servitude exacted from the defendant for other purposes, such as to improve amenities at the plaintiff's expense, was neither contemplated nor covered in clause 7.Ochberg v Cape Town Municipality 1924 CPD at 490.S & B Co v Administrator, Transvaal 1948 (4) SA 745. NC Addleson, for the defendant, argued that the plaintiff was not entitled to cancellation unless he could show that the property was now not suitable for the purposes for which it was bought.Dibley v Furter 1951 (4) SA 73 (C) at 80.Norman on Sale (2nd ed., pp. 317 - 318). The test is objective, Addleson argued, and Van Wyk v Currey NO had been incorrectly decided, insofar as it holds that it is not necessary to prove materiality of the breach where a servitude is imposed.Trinder v Taylor 1921 TPD 517.De Wet and Yeats Kontraktereg (1st ed., p. 198).Lee and Honore Obligations secs 323, 337, 341.Mackeurtan on Sale (3rd ed., pp. 204, 300-301). The plaintiff, furthermore, had not shown that the breach was material. Alternatively, Addleson argued that the Council had imposed the condition in question in the exercise of its statutory powers, and that the plaintiff could not resile by reason of such condition.Snyman v Fowlds 1950 (3) SA 74 (T).Sauerlander v Townsend 1930 CPD 55. The Council was legally entitled to impose these conditions under section 230 of the Cape Municipal Ordinance. The condition was germane to the question of sub- division.S. & B. Co v Administrator Transvaal 1948 (4) SA 745 (T).Ochberg v Cape Town Municipality 1924 CPD 485. Alternatively, Addleson argued that the parties had intended the sale to be subject to such conditions as the Council might impose.Meyer v Merchant's Trust Ltd. 1924 AD 244.Van der Bijl v Barclay's Bank 1953 (2) SA 141 (T).Dutch Reformed Church Council v Crocker 1953 (4) SA 53.  Judgment  The court held that, when the rezoning became impossible, the grant of the road service fell away. The Council, furthermore, was not entitled to retain the road service restriction in addition to the building line condition. The court also held that, when the defendant had requested the cancellation of the road-service grant, the Council should have granted it. Accordingly, it was within the defendant's power to have passed transfer free of the restriction.

It was first broadcast on ITV on 5 November 1990. This was the first episode to be co-written by regular collaborator Robin Driscoll (alongside Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson) and the first to feature the familiar Howard Goodall choral Latin-dubbed theme (Ecce homo qui est faba, English for Behold the Man, Who is a Bean) performed by the choir of Southwark Cathedral. It is the first episode to also introduce the familiar title sequence, albeit in a black-and- white format.  Plot = Act 1: The Department Store = On his way to an Allders department store, Mr. Bean encounters a busker (Dave O'Higgins) playing a tenor saxophone and finds himself unable to give him any change, as he only has a banknote on him. Having an idea, he places a handkerchief on the road nearby and performs a rather silly dance, allowing him to get some change from an elderly woman, which he quickly places in the busker's saxophone case before disappearing through the nearby tunnel. Before long, Bean arrives at the store and takes a moment to admire his new American Express charge card. After having to flee from the perfume department upon feeling overwhelmed by the fragrances, he soon begins searching for items to buy, testing them out first, with some done in unusual fashion ‚Äì he removes a toothbrush from its packet to see how it feels on his teeth, tries on a towel, finds a good peeler by using it on a fresh potato he brought with him and tests two frying pans for size with a raw fish he had inside his jacket. When looking for a new telephone, Bean finds the ones on display don't have a dialing tone and so thinks they don't work, and eventually takes one from a receptionist's desk when he finds it works, unaware that it isn't for sale. At the checkout, he sets his card on the counter, only for another customer (Paul McDowell) to mistakenly take it after accidentally covering up his own charge card of the same kind that the store clerk (William Vandyck) had returned. Bean, realising this, pickpockets the man and swaps the cards back (instead of simply speaking with the man about the mix-up) but, while returning the customer's wallet to his back pocket, he manages to get his hand stuck and finds himself being unwittingly pulled all the way into the men's toilets. In the cubicle, Bean finds himself trapped, with the customer not knowing he is there until he helps him to find the roll of toilet tissue; though the man initially accepts gratefully, he suddenly realizes that he is not alone in the cubicle and jumps up in fright as Bean smiles nervously at him as he leaves the cubicle. = Act 2: The Restaurant = Bean goes to a fancy restaurant to celebrate his birthday. While making his choice and leaving the money for the food on a plate, he writes out a birthday card to himself, feigning surprise upon opening and reading it. When the maitre d' (John Junkin) returns, Bean orders what he thinks will be a regular steak, and as he waits for his food, he takes a moment to sample some of the house wine before using the glasses on his table to chime out \\"Happy Birthday to Me\\". When the waiter (Roger Lloyd-Pack) arrives with his meal, Bean pays him for the meal, making him think he is being given a generous tip. Upon being left to eat his meal, Bean realizes that he ordered a steak tartare, whereupon he becomes disgusted by the meal upon tasting a bit of it and being forced to swallow the first bite so as to avoid upsetting the restaurant staff. Seeking to avoid eating the rest of it, Bean cuts it up and sticks bits of the meal in random places on his table. First, he hides some of it in an ashtray then a tiny flower vase, before hollowing out a portion of the bread roll on his table and using the hollow to hide more of the meal, before sliding some under a small plate, and another portion within the base of a sugar bowl. Shortly after this, a violinist (Steve McNicholas) walks towards his table and, spotting his card, plays \\"Happy Birthday\\" for him, before playing another tune, holding on a note until Bean eats another piece of steak. As soon as the violinist turns his back on him, Bean spits it down the man's trousers. Spotting that a woman on a neighbouring table is distracted by the tunes of the violin, Bean takes her handbag and puts pieces of the steak into it, but while putting it back, he manages to make the waiter trip up over his outstretched leg. Using this opportunity to cover up his actions, Bean blames him for his meal being spread everywhere he hid it, leading the maitre d' to apologise for the accident and relocate him to another table. The waiter soon brings over a new meal on the house, which to Bean's horror turns out to be another steak tartare which is slightly larger than the original. He must now finish it, as the waiter, maitre d' and violinist are all watching him. = Act 3: The Royal Premiere = Later, the cinema where Bean works is preparing to host a royal premiere attended by the Queen. The staff line up in the foyer, awaiting the arrival of the royal party. Bean arrives a little late but is excited to greet the Queen, wondering how to do so and eventually deciding upon a swift bow. As he stands in line between the cinema's manager (Robin Driscoll) and an usherette (Matilda Ziegler), he finds that the men all have pocket handkerchiefs within their smart evening suits. After unsuccessfully attempting to steal the manager's own, Bean uses the white, blank side of a postcard to create a makeshift one. When he notices the manager checking his breath, he soon checks his own and decides to use a breath freshener in his mouth. Bean then becomes concerned that his teeth are not clean and snags a loose thread from the usherette's uniform to floss his teeth, only for the thread to get stuck between them. He eventually yanks it out before briefly turning away to scream in pain. Content the Queen will be impressed with his fresh breath and clean teeth, Bean soon notices his fingernails are not clean and opts to use the fly of his trousers to clean them, finishing up just as the Queen arrives. As she begins to greet the staff, Bean realises he forgot to zip up his flies, panicking when they become stuck and then when he sticks his hand down his trousers to pull them up and leaves his finger stuck out through them in a rather lewd manner.

Powers of graphs are referred to using terminology similar to that of exponentiation of numbers: G2 is called the square of G, G3 is called the cube of G, etc.. Graph powers should be distinguished from the products of a graph with itself, which (unlike powers) generally have many more vertices than the original graph. Properties If a graph has diameter d, then its d-th power is the complete graph. If a graph family has bounded clique-width, then so do its d-th powers for any fixed d.. =Coloring= Graph coloring on the square of a graph may be used to assign frequencies to the participants of wireless communication networks so that no two participants interfere with each other at any of their common neighbors, and to find graph drawings with high angular resolution.. Both the chromatic number and the degeneracy of the kth power of a planar graph of maximum degree Œî are O(\\\\Delta^{\\\\lfloor k/2\\\\rfloor}), where the degeneracy bound shows that a greedy coloring algorithm may be used to color the graph with this many colors.. For the special case of a square of a planar graph, Wegner conjectured in 1977 that the chromatic number of the square of a planar graph is at most \\\\max\\\\left(\\\\Delta+5, \\\\frac{3\\\\Delta}{2}+1\\\\right), and it is known that the chromatic number is at most \\\\frac{5\\\\Delta}{3}+O(1)... More generally, for any graph with degeneracy d and maximum degree Œî, the degeneracy of the square of the graph is O(dŒî), so many types of sparse graph other than the planar graphs also have squares whose chromatic number is proportional to Œî. Although the chromatic number of the square of a nonplanar graph with maximum degree Œî may be proportional to Œî2 in the worst case, it is smaller for graphs of high girth, being bounded by O(Œî2/log Œî) in this case.. Determining the minimum number of colors needed to color the square of a graph is NP-hard, even in the planar case. list publications proving NP-hardness for general graphs by McCormick (1983) and Lin and Skiena (1995), and for planar graphs by Ramanathan and Lloyd (1992, 1993). =Hamiltonicity= The cube of every connected graph necessarily contains a Hamiltonian cycle., p. 105. It is not necessarily the case that the square of a connected graph is Hamiltonian, and it is NP-complete to determine whether the square is Hamiltonian.. Nevertheless, by Fleischner's theorem, the square of a 2-vertex-connected graph is always Hamiltonian.. Computational complexity The kth power of a graph with n vertices and m edges may be computed in time O(mn) by performing a breadth first search starting from each vertex to determine the distances to all other vertices, or slightly faster using more sophisticated algorithms. Alternatively, If A is an adjacency matrix for the graph, modified to have nonzero entries on its main diagonal, then the nonzero entries of Ak give the adjacency matrix of the kth power of the graph,. from which it follows that constructing kth powers may be performed in an amount of time that is within a logarithmic factor of the time for matrix multiplication. The kth powers of trees can be recognized in time linear in the size of the input graph. . Given a graph, deciding whether it is the square of another graph is NP-complete. . Moreover, it is NP-complete to determine whether a graph is a kth power of another graph, for a given number k ‚â• 2, or whether it is a kth power of a bipartite graph, for k > 2.. Induced subgraphs as the half-square of a cube graph The half-square of a bipartite graph is the subgraph of induced by one side of the bipartition of .

Stephen's Place, Adelaide Matthew Goode (c. 1820 ‚Äì 26 August 1901) was born at either Hampton Charles, Worcester, or Leominster, Herefordshire England. He was apprenticed to a draper in Hereford, where he worked for some time, then he and his brother, Charles Henry Goode, moved to London. Charles decided to try his luck in South Australia and journeyed to Adelaide, where he opened a successful drapery business in Kermode street, North Adelaide, and four or five years later Matthew Goode, who had been working with Goode Gainford and Co., of The Borough, London and J and C Boyd and Co. of Friday Street, London, together with brother Samuel and their parents, arrived in Adelaide on the Princess Helena in September 1850 . Shortly afterwards they removed to Rundle Street, in a building which was later occupied by Charles Birks & Co. :For a time, Charles Moore was an employee, and went on to found the celebrated department store in Grote Street and Victoria Square. :Robert John Lavis (c. 1860 ‚Äì 27 May 1941) had a career with Goode Brothers and Matthew Goode and Co., then in 1907 purchased the moribund Hooper's Furnishers of Hindley Street, which he turned into a highly regarded and profitable institution. Charles and Matthew then opened a wholesale warehouse in Stephens Place, under the name of Goode Bros. The retail business was later sold to L. Roach. Subsequently, Goode Brothers removed to Grenfell Street, and in 1870 after the brothers had been together in business for over 30 years they dissolved their partnership. Matthew Goode and his sons continued in possession of the warehouse in Grenfell Street, while C. H. Goode became a proprietor of the wholesalers Goode, Durrant, & Co., also in Grenfell Street. Matthew Goode was for a few years a member of Adelaide City Council. He then strongly advocated the construction of the deep drainage system, which, was adopted, despite many members who wanted the refuse drained to the sea. He was one of the founders of the Stow Memorial Church, and for several years he was the treasurer of the church. He was on the committee of the local chapter of the London Missionary Society, and was connected with the Adelaide City Mission from the time of its inception, and with the Lay Preachers' Association. He worked with Sir George Williams in connection with the London YMCA, and with Dean Russell in the Funeral Reform Association. =The next generation= In 1902 the Grenfell Street premises were disposed of, and the business relocated to the old Goode Brothers site on Stephens Place, and the company was floated as a limited liability company with Edward Francis Goode, (Matthew) Albert Goode and R. J. Leavis as directors. Five years later Samuel Henry Goode replaced Leavis. In 1923 the directors were Edward Francis, Matthew Albert, and Arthur Hedley Goode, and the London office was managed by H. P. Goode. The company had 16 commercial travellers covering the whole State, with interstate branches in Argent Street, Broken Hill and Hay Street, Perth. Paul Goode was a director in 1928. =Family= Matthew Goode was a brother of Sir Charles Henry Goode MP., founder of Goode, Durrant and Co., Samuel Goode jun, and Elizabeth Ann Goode who also emigrated to South Australia; she married John Ham Marshall in 1853. Their parents Samuel (died 1856) and Ann (c. 1786 ‚Äì 15 July 1874) had leasehold properties at Walkerville and Islington. Ann was a sister of Sarah Tolley (c. 1793‚Äì1872), mother of George Tolley of Rundle Street. :Thomas Goode (1816‚Äì1882) of Goolwa was a cousin, whose family included Matthew Goode (1847‚Äì1931) who ran a business in Willunga.

It was first broadcast on ITV on 30 December 1990 and was watched by 13.8 million viewers during its original transmission. It won the 1991 International Emmy Award for Outstanding Popular Arts Programme.  Plot = Act 1: The Swimming Pool and the Car Park= Bean decides to go the local public indoor swimming pool, where he uses a mechanical arm grabber to take out his ticket from the machine and parks his Mini in the nearby car park. Once inside and changed, he becomes excited upon seeing a couple of children's slides and attempts to use one, only for a lifeguard to spot him and order him off the slides. Bean soon spots the diving boards and decides to try out the highest one. However, he soon becomes frightened when he learns how high up he is, and tries to chicken out, only to find two boys waiting for their turn. Forced to attempt a dive, Bean fails at his initial try and decides to climb off the edge. One of the two impatient boys decides to get him off the diving board by stamping on his hand, causing him to fall into the pool. Upon surfacing, Bean spots that his trunks came off and fails to retrieve them as a little girl in a yellow swimsuit fishes them out with her snorkel and innocently takes them with her without her parents noticing. Left naked, just as the lifeguard orders everyone out, Bean attempts to get back to the changing room, hiding to avoid being spotted by a female lifeguard only to encounter and freak out a group of female swimmers who see his nude body, scream, and run away. After drying and changing back into his clothes, Bean prepares to leave the car park, only to find he must pay ¬£16 in order to raise the barrier over the exit. Since this is too expensive, he opts to find a way to avoid this and decides to find a way of leaving through the entrance. Bean pushes a rubbish bin into the entrance to trick the ticket machine into issuing a ticket to open the barrier and he drives his Mini out, but just as he moves the bin out of the way to leave, a car drives in and forces him to reverse back into the car park. Tentatively waiting to drive at the barrier over the entrance, Bean suddenly spots the blue Reliant about to enter the car park. As the driver takes a ticket from the machine and opens the barrier, Bean drives his Mini at full speed towards the Reliant, forcing it out of his way and causing it to topple over as he leaves. = Act 2: Lunch in the Park = Heading for the park for lunch, Bean greets a man who is also having lunch while sitting on a bench. Spotting him having a sandwich, Bean sets about making his own using ingredients and tools he stuffed into his coat. He cuts two slices of bread from a loaf with scissors, spreads butter on them with his credit card, washes lettuce under a drinking fountain's water before using his sock to dry it, kills two sardines he takes out of a jar and then crushes peppercorns folded into a handkerchief using his shoe. After making his sandwich, Bean notices the man sipping some tea, and prepares to make his own using a hot water bottle, putting a teabag into it while placing the bottle's cap in his ear. He then proceeds to suck up milk from a baby bottle and spit it into the water in the hot water bottle, before sloshing it together. As he prepares to have his lunch, he ties his handkerchief around his neck, opting to use it as a napkin, only for the pepper traces on it to cause him to sneeze, making him drop his sandwich onto the ground and spray his tea all over himself, ruining his own lunch. The man, witnessing this, offers Bean the other half of his pre-packed sandwich as replacement, much to Bean's gratitude as the cap pops out of his ear. = Act 3: The Horror Film = Driving to meet up with his girlfriend Irma Gobb at the cinema, Bean is temporarily stopped at a junction by a set of traffic lights, but upon seeing a cyclist push his bike manually, he opts to do the same with his Mini and push it round to the road he wants to take, before driving off. Arriving at the cinema, Bean prepares to watch a horror film which appears to be titled A Nightmare (the film poster shown is that of A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child, depicting Freddy Krueger, with the camera placed to cut off the last words) with Irma, providing them with popcorn ‚Äì a large tub for himself along with a hidden drink in his top, and a small tub for Irma, stealing some from her tub but scolding her when she tries to do the same. Before the film begins, Bean teases her by scaring her with silly practical jokes. However, as the film begins, he soon finds himself being scared witless with the various scenes frightening him to the point he tries to avoid watching it, even trying to force Irma to leave with him only to be forced to remain in his seat. Bean then tries to cover his head with his sweater, causing Irma to scream when she thinks his head has been cut off. Finally, Bean manages to find a solution by using some popcorn as earplugs, and using the popcorn tub to cover his eyes from the film. This works, and he manages to avoid the remaining scenes. As everyone begins to leave as the film ends, Irma lets Bean know they are leaving to which he removes the tub and eats the popcorn earplugs, before trying to tease another of the cinema's customers. The episode ends with Bean failing to notice that she put her coat over her like a cape, causing the pair to scream in fright when Bean finds her coat arm empty, ending the episode.

(Utrecht 1555? - Leuven, 11 January 1631), was a theologian, historian, and cartographer from the Low Countries. He is best known for his history of the origins of the Dutch Revolt, written from a Catholic perspective but without polemical bias. He was one of the first cartographers to make thematic maps and globes. Life Haraeus first attended the Latin school of the Brethren of the Common Life in Utrecht and subsequently studied theology at the University of Louvain under Thomas Stapleton and Joannes Molanus. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest at an early age, probably in 1578. He was appointed as a professor of rhetoric at the recently established University of Douai where he also obtained a Licentiate of Theology. In 1581 he accompanied the papal legate Antonio Possevino on an embassy to John III of Sweden and Ivan the Terrible. Back in the Dutch Republic he became a canon at St. John's Cathedral ('s-Hertogenbosch), later dean in Duinkerken and professor of theology at Tongerlo Abbey. In 1604-1609 he worked as a priest in Utrecht where he was in contact with Buchelius. After 1609 he moved permanently to the Spanish Netherlands where he became the rector of a nunnery in Antwerp, before becoming a canon in Namur in 1617, and after 1621 in Leuven. He died in the latter city on 11 January 1631,According to both Van der Aa and Molhuyzen/Blok he died in 1632 but more modern sources like Haitsma Mulier give 1631 as year of death. and was buried in the St. Peter Church in Leuven, near the tomb of Thomas Stapleton. Historical works Haraeus compiled a large number of hagiographies. However, his historical works of longer lasting import concerned the first part of the Eighty Years' War through which he had lived himself. He clearly took the side of king Philip II of Spain against William the Silent, giving his work a clear bias. His first publication in this field was (Antwerp 1612).\\"Impartial explanation of the causes of the Low Countries war from the year 1566 to 1608\\". On Google Books. This provoked a critical response from the Dutch judge Fran√ßois Vranck. (Refutation of a certain booklet published by Franchois Verhaer, etc.), published 1618. Meanwhile, Haraeus had already started on his major history: Annales ducum seu principum Brabantiae totiusque Belgii tomi tres: quorum primo solius Brabantiae, secundo Belgii uniti principum res gestae, tertio Belgici tumultus usque ad inductas anno MDCIX pactas, enarrantur\\"Annals of the dukes or princes of Brabant and the entire Netherlands in three volumes: which are firstly Brabant alone, secondly the acts of the prince of the united Netherlands, thirdly the Dutch troubles up to the truce of 1609, explained\\". On Google Books (Antwerp 1623). This work was well received in the Spanish Netherlands where it was long a \\"best seller\\". The third volume was reworked by its author, but this version only exists in manuscript; it was never printed. Cartographic work Haraeus was one of several clergymen from the Netherlands who around the turn of the 17th century made important contributions to the young science of map-making (another was Petrus Plancius). He was one of the three cartographers in the Spanish Netherlands who kept the craft of globe-making alive there after the exodus of many cartographers around the turn of the 17th century. In 1614 he published a six-gore map entitled Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductusNew image of the world as a globe, derived from the Analemmata of Ptolemy. This was one of the first instances of a thematic map as it showed the dispersion of Christianity and Islam at the time, using map symbols developed by Jodocus Hondius in his Designatio Orbis Christiani (1607)Outmapping of the Christian World. In 1624 a map entitled Lumen Historiarum per OrientemLight of histories over the East. was published by Balthasar Moretus as part of a new edition of Ortelius' Theatrum orbis terrarum ParergonAppendix to Theatrum orbis terrarum or Theater of the Lands of the World. which recognized Haraeus as its maker. This map was part of a set of two made earlier by Haraeus and designed as a comprehensive guide to sacred geography. As a final example, Haraeus Geographica restituta per globi trientesGeography set up by thirds of a globe. (1618) shows the world in three globe-gores, with insets showing a map representing the 2nd-century worldview of Ptolemy at lower right, and a legend for the map in the lower center, explaining symbols which identify religious populations (a cross for Christian regions, a crescent for Islam, and a slanted arrow for barbarians).

Living off the proceeds of prostitution is illegal. In 2015, it was estimated there were 20,000 sex workers in the country. Human trafficking, HIV and child prostitution are problems in the country. Overview Whilst some street prostitution occurs, because of police harassment its extent is limited. Most prostitution occurs in bars and hotels. \\"Bar girls\\" are employed by the owners on very low wages; they make up their money by prostitution. Although prostitutes in bars are mostly employed by the bar owners, there are some freelance girls who will try to attract customers by moving from bar to bar. Food handling hygiene rules require all staff employed in bars to have monthly health checks, but this is not always enforced. Often the bar girls are from rural areas, moving to the towns and cities in search of lucrative employment. Sex workers and NGOs report harassment and abuse from the police, including violence, theft and forced sex. They also report that police take no action if abuse or violence by clients is reported to them by sex workers. Prostitution also occurs around the logging centres of Luwawa, Nthungwa, Raiply and Kalungulu. The prostitutes work from small shacks around the villages in the forests. In previous years many women from Malawi went to work in Zambia's copperfields as prostitutes. The road leading towards Zambia came to be known as mtengamahule (conveyor of prostitutes). The border was subsequently closed to \\"unmarried women\\". Legal situation Section 146 of the Malawi Penal Code prohibits living off the earnings of prostitution. This has been interpreted by the courts to include a sex worker's own earnings, effectively making prostitution illegal. Section 184(c) of the Penal Code makes an offence of: \\"every person in or upon or near any premises or in any road or highway or any place adjacent thereto or in any public place at such time and under such circumstances as to lead to the conclusion that such person is there for an illegal or disorderly purpose, is deemed a rogue and vagabond\\". (This law is based on the British Vagrancy Act 1824). This legislation was used to target sex workers. A group of 14 sex workers were arrested in 2009 in the southern city of Mwanza. They were taken to a hospital and forcibly given HIV tests. The results of the tests were later read out in open court. The sex workers subsequently sued the Malawi government for \\"damages as compensation for violation of their constitutional rights and trauma suffered as a result of actions of the police and a hospital‚Äù. High Court judge, Dorothy Kamanga, ruled that the sex workers should be compensated, and that the actions of the police and health workers were \\"irrational, unjust, unfair and unreasonable.\\" In September 2016, the Zomba High Court ruled that Section 146 of the Penal Code was meant to protect sex workers against exploitation, not criminalise sex workers. The court overturned the conviction of the 19 sex workers that had appealed against conviction by a magistrates court. In January 2017, three judges of the Malawi High Court declared section 184(1)(c) of the Penal Code unconstitutional and invalid. HIV Like other Sub-Saharan Africa countries, HIV is a major problem in Malawi. In 2016 the adult prevalence rate was 9.2%. Sex workers are a high risk group with a 24.9% prevalence rate in 2016. The reluctance of clients to use condoms, and lack of access to health services for sex workers are contributory causes. Clients may offer up to 4 times the usual rate for sex without a condom. Condoms are also in short supply in some areas of the country. Sex trafficking Malawi is a source country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. To a lesser extent, it is a destination country for men, women, and children from Zambia, Mozambique, the African Great Lakes region, and the Horn of Africa who are subjected to sex trafficking, and a transit country for people from these countries exploited in South Africa. Traffickers, primarily facilitators or brothel owners, typically lure children from their families in rural areas under pretences of employment opportunities, clothing, or lodging for which they are sometimes charged exorbitant fees, resulting in prostitution coerced through debts. Traffickers subject young girls to sexual exploitation in nightclubs or bars. Malawian victims of sex trafficking have been identified in Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and Tanzania. Some young girls are drugged, gang-raped, and exploited in commercial sex. Some girls recruited for domestic service are instead forced to marry and subsequently subjected to child sex trafficking by their ‚Äúhusbands‚Äù. Fraudulent employment agencies lure women and girls to Gulf states where they are exploited in sex trafficking.

It was also the country's largest manufacturer of chipped glass, with capacity double that of its nearest competitor. The company's works was the first of eight glass plants that existed in Hartford City, Indiana during the Indiana Gas Boom. It became the city's largest manufacturer and employer, peaking with 600 employees. Many of the skilled workers employed at the Hartford City Glass Company were from Belgium, at the time the world‚Äôs leading manufacturer of window glass. The Belgian workers and their families accounted for over one-third of Hartford City's population during the 1890s, and lived on the city's south side. Because of the importance of the French-speaking Belgians, one of the local newspapers featured articles in French. In 1899, Hartford City Glass was acquired by the American Window Glass Company, which controlled 85 percent of the American window glass manufacturing capacity. During the next decade, the company began replacing its skilled and well‚Äìpaid Belgian glass blowers with machines and less-skilled machine operators. The company used the Hartford City plant to test and refine the new technology. Most of the Belgian glass workers left town. During the 1920s, competitors developed new window glass production processes that eclipsed the American Window Glass technology, and the company lost its advantage. By the time the Great Depression struck, the Hartford City plant had closed. Manufacturers drawn to Indiana Eaton, Hartford City, and Blackford County, Indiana in 1887During the late 1880s, the discovery of natural gas in Eaton, Indiana started an economic boom period in East Central Indiana. Manufacturers were lured to the region to take advantage of the low cost fuel. Blackford County, a small rural county located close to Eaton, had only 181 people working in manufacturing in 1880. By 1901, the county had over 1,100 people employed at manufacturing plants in small communities such as Hartford City, Indiana. Between 1880 and 1900, populations doubled in area counties such as Blackford, Delaware, and Grant. The region became Indiana‚Äôs major manufacturing center. =Hartford City= Like many Indiana communities during the gas boom, Hartford City‚Äôs leaders sought to take advantage of their newfound energy resource. The Hartford City Land Company was formed in 1891 as part of the effort to attract manufacturers. The company offered \\"free sites, free gas, excellent switching facilities, and reasonable cash subsidies\\" as enticements for manufacturers to locate in the boom town. Manufacturers that used high quantities of energy were especially attracted to no-cost or low-cost natural gas sites, and glassmaking was one of those energy-consuming industries. Hartford City's success in attracting manufacturers can be indirectly measured by its population growth. The city's population was 2,287 in 1890, but grew to 5,912 by 1900. In 1890, the city convinced glassmaker Richard Heagany to relocate from Kokomo, Indiana. An additional glass maker, Sneath Glass Company, relocated from Tiffin, Ohio, in 1894. During 1901, Indiana state inspectors visited 15 manufacturing facilities in Hartford City. These manufacturers employed 1,077 people, and the American Window Glass plant (the former Hartford City Glass Company) plus the Sneath Glass works accounted for over half of the manufacturing employees. By 1902, Hartford City was the home of 8 glass factories. Organization and management In 1878, glassmaker Richard Heagany organized a window glass plant in New York and was the factory's superintendent. That plant became the largest window glass plant in the state. In 1886, he moved to Kokomo, Indiana, and opened the first window glass plant in the region to use natural gas as a fuel source. Heagany's Kokomo plant lasted three years before it was destroyed by fire. Instead of rebuilding in Kokomo, he moved to Hartford City and organized the Hartford City Glass Company. The company was organized in 1890 with the financial assistance of several capitalists. Production began in early 1891 after the plant was constructed. Heagany was the plant manager until his retirement in 1899. =Capitalists= One of the principal stockholders of the new company was multi-millionaire A. M. Barber. Barber was involved in grain and banking in Akron, Ohio. Another important investor from Akron was Colonel Arthur Latham Conger, who was the company's first president. Conger was a Civil War veteran who invested in companies in Ohio and Indiana (including in Kokomo). He was also elected president of the Hartford City Land Company in 1893. Hartford City's Sydney W. Cantwell was secretary of the Hartford City Glass Company during its early years. He was also president of the state organization of window glass manufacturers. Cantwell was an attorney involved with the Blackford County Bank, Akron Oil Company, and Hartford City Land Company. Another Hartford City investor, Henry \\"H. B.\\" Smith, was president of Hartford City's Citizen's Bank. =Management change= Top management changed during 1895 after the company's annual shareholders' meeting. Colonel A. L. Conger, who had been president since the company's beginning, lost his position to another colonel from Akron, George T. Perkins. Conger had fallen into disfavor with many of the local citizens. He immediately expressed his unhappiness with the election by selling his company stock and leaving town. Conger's stock was purchased by Kokomo banker John A. Jay. Officers of Hartford City Glass in 1896 were George T. Perkins, President; John A. Jay, Vice President; H.B. Smith, Treasurer; Richard Heagany, General Manager; and John Rodgers Johnston, Secretary. Colonel George Tod Perkins was a Civil War veteran and president of the B. F. Goodrich Company. He was also involved in banking and had been president of the Bank of Akron. John R. Johnston began working at the Hartford City plant in 1890 as a bookkeeper. He was elected secretary after 4 years. Johnston lived in Hartford City and helped Heagany run the business. Heagany submitted his resignation at the August 1899 board meeting, retiring after 42 years in the glass business. Johnston became plant manager at that time. Johnston resigned a short time later, effective April 1900. He formed Hartford City's Johnston Glass Company in September of the same year. Workforce During its peak years, Hartford City Glass Company employed 500 to 600 people. In 1894, it employed 100 glass blowers as part of a total workforce of 540 people. The wages for that workforce were said to be equivalent to \\"about 1500 men in any other industry.\\" Not only was the glass works the largest industry in the county, it was thought to be the second-largest plant of any industry located in the Indiana Gas Belt. To help meet the housing needs for the factory's many employees, 184 houses were built nearby. In 1896, 443 workers at the plant lived in Hartford City, especially on the south side. Assuming each local worker had a family of five, over one-third of the city's population (2,235 of \\"an estimated 6,000\\") was financially dependent upon Hartford City Glass. =Glassmakers= The window glass manufacturing process used by Hartford City Glass was known as the Cylinder Method. The process was labor-intensive, and required the services of a glass blower and glass cutter‚Äîwho were both highly skilled and well paid. The glass blower led a small production crew that included skilled and unskilled workers. At older plants, the glass blower's workstation was adjacent to a ceramic pot located inside the furnace. Each pot contained molten glass created by melting a batch of ingredients that included sand, soda, and lime. At newer plants such as the Hartford City works, tanks were used instead of pots. The tanks were essentially huge brick pots with multiple workstations. A tank furnace is more efficient than a pot furnace, but more costly to build. In the first step of the glass-making process, molten glass was extracted from the pot or tank. The glass blower and his helper used a blowpipe, which was typically to long, to create a bubble of molten glass. The glass blower manipulated the bubble into a cylinder, and removed it from the pot or tank. The cylinders were to in diameter, and or long. Next, the glass‚Äìcutter cut the cylinder, and the glass was flattened. It was necessary to gradually cool the glass, a process known as annealing, to prevent it from breaking. A lehr or annealing oven was used to anneal the product. A typical 20th-century lehr was a large conveyor inside a long oven. The newly made glass gradually moved from the hot end of the lehr to its opposite end, which was at room temperature. The glass would then be cut into the desired window glass size, placed in a box, and moved to inventory. It is not known if (or when) the lehrs at the Hartford City plant had conveyors. =The Belgians= During the late 19th century, glass blowers were difficult to find. Belgium was the largest exporter of window glass to the United States, and plant manager Heagany previously used the skills of glass blowers from that country in his Kokomo glass works. In Hartford City, Heagany again relied upon Belgian workers for the skilled positions in his glass works. The city's influx of French-speaking Belgians affected the town. The south side (south of Lick Creek) became known as Belgium Town. Most Belgians were Catholic, and they built the city's Catholic church near their homes on the city's south side. The church's Father Dhe was a native of France and was also involved with glass making. During the early 1900s, the local Blackford County Gazette claimed to be the \\"only newspaper in State that prints French and circulates among the window glass and iron workers, the highest paid skilled mechanics in the world.\\" The Belgian workforce also affected the city's north side. Hartford City's Presbyterian Church, which is now part of the National Register of Historical Places, was built one block north of the courthouse in 1894‚Äîand features large stained glass windows imported from Belgium. For over 50 years, the bigger of two huge windows was considered the largest single- frame window in the state of Indiana. These stained-glass windows, plus at least four smaller ones, were installed by the local (and mostly Catholic) Belgian glass workers. Infrastructure Drawing of the Hartford City Glass Company plant in 1896Construction of Hartford City's new glass works was completed in early January 1891, and production started shortly thereafter. The glass works was located on Hartford City's south side, and originally occupied . Natural gas was the plant's original fuel source for both the furnace used to make the glass and the ovens used to gradually cool it. In the United States, two systems were used during the 1890s to create molten glass. The older system used a pot furnace, where ceramic pots were heated inside the furnace to melt the batch of ingredients needed to make the molten glass. The newer system used a large brick tank that could be operated continuously or by the batch. The Hartford City plant used the tank system, and it was originally the \\"largest tank window glass factory in the world\\". The tank had a capacity equivalent to 30 pots, giving the Hartford City plant more than double the capacity of some of the window glass plants built a few years earlier in Ohio. With its size, newest technology, and newly built facilities, the plant was \\"said to be the largest and best arranged window glass works in the world.\\" During its existence, the plant was always one of the largest window glass works in the United States. Initial production at the Hartford City plant continued until June, when the works was shut down to decrease inventories. Summer shutdowns were normal in the glass industry at that time. The heat from the furnaces combined with summer weather made extremely uncomfortable working conditions, justifying the summer months as the best time to shut down for maintenance (or for manipulation of inventories). In the case of the first year's shutdown for the Hartford City Glass works, production was restarted in October. =Expansion= In 1892, management decided to expand the factory's capacity by adding a second tank. The new tank would add approximately 50 pots of capacity. In early April, construction of the facilities for the new tank began. \\"Modern and improved methods in all departments of the works\\" were used, improving the efficiency in manufacturing and shipping. The new buildings were made fire-resistant by using stone, brick, and iron for construction materials. They were also well ventilated, which made the work environment more comfortable for the glass workers. The expansion increased total capacity to about 90 pots. This made the works the second-largest glass factory in the United States. Expenditures necessary to finance the expansion were $100,000 (over $2.5 million in 2012 dollars). During 1893, the company considered adding a third tank, which would add another 60 pots of capacity. The expansion cost estimate was $150,000 (over $3.8 million in 2012 dollars), and was said to \\"give employment to 350 men.\\" Two major concerns voiced by management to community leaders were adequate fire protection and housing for the workers. Community leaders did not respond soon enough, and the expansion was postponed. However, it is no coincidence that Hartford City's waterworks began operations in 1894, and the plant was built on the city's south side. The city also acquired a chemical fire engine from the Chicago Fire Extinguisher Company, which was delivered in February 1894. Although the third tank was not added in 1893, a new ware room was built. The room was long by wide, and could hold 20,000 boxes. The roof and walls were covered in iron. By September (without the capacity expansion), the plant had a payroll of $45,000 (over $1.1 million in 2012 dollars) per month, and employed 500 glass workers. In 1896, the plant employed 550 people, and produced about 2 million square feet of window glass per month. In addition to window glass, the company was the nation‚Äôs largest producer of chipped glass, with capacity double that of the second-largest manufacturer. Chipped glass was a popular ornamental glass used for interiors of office buildings and with furniture. At that time, the plant was the second-largest window glass producer in the country, although it became the third-largest later in the year. Its grounds had grown to cover , and included a railroad spur off of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The grounds contained two melting rooms, two warehouses, a blacksmith shop, and a machine shop. The tank in one of the melting rooms was long, wide, and deep. One tank required 4 flattening ovens and a cutting room. Plans for the addition of another tank began again in late 1896. A third tank would make the Hartford City plant the largest in the country. As part of the conditions for expansion, the plant owners requested housing for its potential new workers. Although the houses were built, the company was not satisfied, as the expansion was never consummated. Without the third tank, the workforce still grew to 600 by 1898. Acquisition Advertisement for American Window Glass in 1913In 1898, a group of men led by James A. Chambers organized a glass trust called American Window Glass Company. The company was formed from the American Glass Company, but did not incorporate until 1899. The trust planned to acquire 70 glass plants, \\"some of which it will close to bring the production down to the demand.\\" The prices offered for the glass plants were very generous. Owners of the glass plants could sell their plant for either cash or a combination of cash and stock in the new company. Many owners chose to receive stock. The trust was incorporated effective August 2, 1899. James A. Chambers continued as president, and Hartford City‚Äôs H.B. Smith was one of the directors of the newly incorporated company. Initial acquisitions included over 20 major window glass plants, including Hartford City Glass Company. Most of the original acquisitions were from Indiana and Pennsylvania. Those glass plants were important enough to enable American Window Glass to control 85 percent of the window glass production in the United States. Many of the Indiana glass works acquired by the trust were from the East Central Indiana Gas Belt. Among those plants were the Hartford City Glass Company; and the nearby Muncie plants of Maring, Hart, and Company and C. H. Over. Other plants were located in Anderson, Dunkirk, and Fairmount, Indiana. The Hartford City Glass Company became known as Plant Number 3 of the American Window Glass Company. J. R. Johnston, already manager for Hartford City Glass Company, was named manager of the American Window Glass version of the same plant in December. A second window glass factory from Hartford City, Jones Glass Company, was also acquired‚Äîand became plant No. 32. Eventually, the company acquired 41 glass factories. American Window Glass After the acquisition, the Hartford City Glass works became known as plant number 3 of the American Window Glass Company. The plant employed 450 people in 1901. As natural gas supplies in Indiana became depleted, many manufacturers moved or did not survive. The major plants of the American Window Glass successfully changed energy sources from natural gas to gas made from coal. The company also had a technological advantage. Instead of using a glass blower, American Window Glass plants extracted molten glass with a machine. The machine, which was not immediately utilized at all American Window Glass plants, was known as the Lubbers blowing machine. Refinements to the machine and glass-making process were made at the Hartford City works by plant manager Harry G. Slingluff. Production records for the entire company were set at the Hartford City plant in 1905 and 1907‚Äîusing the Lubbers machines. =Lubbers machine= The glass blowing machine used by American Window Glass factories was created by Pittsburgh resident John H. Lubbers, and he continued to contribute improvements to the machine over the next decade. By using the Lubbers machine, human glass blowers were replaced with a machine operator paid 30 percent of the glass blower wage. The machine was also five times more productive than the human blowers. It could make windows four times as large because a larger cylinder was extracted from the tank of molten glass. Thus, the highest‚Äìpaid skilled workers in the United States were considered obsolete. In the case of Hartford City, machines replaced most of the human glass blowers by 1908. =Consolidation= During the spring of 1900, rumors circulated that American Window Glass planned to move production from smaller plants in nearby Dunkirk and Redkey (factories 17, 30, 34, and 41) to the large southside Hartford City plant. If the Hartford City plant would have its capacity expanded equal to the capacity of the plants to be consolidated, then Hartford City would have \\"become the greatest window glass town in the world.\\" The plant would have employed nearly 1000 people, equaling the largest window glass plant in the world in capacity. That plant in combination with Hartford City's two other window glass factories, not even considering the flint glass plants or bottle plants, would make the city's window glass capacity the highest in the world. The rumor had some truth‚Äîsmaller plants were eventually closed. However, Hartford City's large southside plant was not expanded. In 1905 American Window Glass sold some of its smaller plants, including Hartford City's plant number 32. Plant number 3 still continued operations. It employed 500 people in 1910. Before the start of World War I, American Window Glass Company was still the dominant window glass manufacturer, accounting for over half of the nation's window glass manufacturing capacity. In 1913, the company continued to close many of its smaller plants, while the large plants were equipped with the glass blowing machines. Plant number 3 was the third largest window glass factory in the United States, and the largest west of Pennsylvania. The Belgian portion of Hartford City's glassmaking workforce was dramatically reduced because of two factors: the glass-blowing machine replaced human glass blowers; and Belgians had difficulty returning from summer vacations in their European homeland after the start of World War I. American Window Glass made record profits in 1920. All of the company's small plants had been sold or closed by that time. The glass-blowing machines were still being used to extract molten glass. The company was described as having \\"six large and well-equipped plants located near the Pittsburgh district, and one large plant at Hartford City, Ind.\\" Decline Drawing from 1920 M. J. Owens patent \\"Means for Making Sheet Glass\\"During the beginning of the 20th century, competitors of the American Window Glass trust used a different approach to gain a technological advantage. The machines used by American Window Glass replaced glass blowers, but still used the same blowing and cutting process used in the 1880s‚Äîalthough the company was constantly working to make the process more efficient. Competitors such as American inventor Irving W. Colburn began working on a machine that produced window glass using a different process. Colburn patented his work during the first decade of the 20th century. Although he filed for bankruptcy in 1912, his patents were purchased by Edward Drummond Libbey and Michael J. Owens‚Äîwho hired Colburn to continue work on the machine. Owens was the creator of the Owens Bottling Machine that revolutionized the glass bottle industry. Working with Colburn, Owens improved the window glass machine enough that it began being used for production in 1921. By 1926, Libbey-Owens had gained a window glass market share of 29 percent, while American Window Glass's share was 59 percent. During the 1920s, Pittsburgh Plate Glass also developed a new process for making window glass, creating even more competition in the window glass industry. Because of the improved technology and processes utilized by competitors, many of the American Window Glass patents, and much of its machinery, became obsolete. By the late 1920s, American Window Glass was forced to begin re-equipping its plants with new machinery. The company underwent a financial reorganization in 1929. Dividends on its preferred stock were lowered. Although a few plants were re-equipped, the Hartford City plant was not. Hartford City's natural gas supply was depleted, and the type of sand used to produce glass was in better supply near other American Window Glass plants in Pennsylvania. Thus, American Window Glass Company plant number 3, the former Hartford City Glass Company, was closed in 1929.

It was first broadcast on ITV on 15 October 1991 and was watched by 14.42 million viewers during its original transmission. This was the first episode to be produced and broadcast in NICAM stereo and the first to be overseen by a new production team ‚Äì directors John Birkin and Paul Weiland (working on studio and location sequences respectively) and producer Sue Vertue. It was also the first episode to introduce the familiar 'street' version of the title sequence.  Plot = Act 1: The Television = Mr. Bean has just bought a portable television and, after bringing it home and having to crawl out his car window (since the television box is strapped to the car, preventing the door from opening), brings it upstairs to his flat whereupon he inserts a few coins into his electricity meter to feed power to the wall. Upon unpacking the television out of the box and setting it up on a stand, he realises he's looking at the rear of it. Bean plugs it into a socket and wonders why it is not coming on, only to realise he forgot to wire the plug with the TV's power cable. Upon doing so by screwing the cable into the plug, plugging the aerial and turning on the TV, he discovers he gets no reception regardless of where he moves the aerial to. When he puts the aerial on the floor and sits on a chair in a particular spot, the TV suddenly gets reception, but only if the TV is not facing him. He tries bending over to see the screen, but loses reception when he turns his head to face the screen. No matter what he does, he cannot get reception with the screen in his line of sight. Ingeniously, he decides to take off all his clothes and assemble them on the chair to resemble himself. This eventually works when he includes his underwear in the assembly (using the TV's cardboard box to cover himself). Unfortunately, just as Bean sits down to watch the programme, the electricity meter runs out and cuts off the power, much to his annoyance. = Act 2: The Thief = Later that day, Bean heads out to the local park to try out his new Polaroid camera. Unable to get a clear shot, Bean asks a passerby to take his photo, but the man tricks Bean and makes off with the camera. Upon realising what happened, Bean seeks the thief out, eventually trapping him in a rubbish bin and stabbing him with a pencil, but the thief gets away just as Bean alerts a passing police officer (Matilda Ziegler) to the incident. At the police station, Bean tries to identify the thief in a police lineup, but asks the police sergeant to make a slight alteration after having difficulty trying to identify the thief by requesting the men in the line-up to have rubbish bins over their heads. Using his pencil, Bean stabs each one until he hears the culprit's scream of pain that he recalls, effectively identifying him to the police. = Act 3: The Shoe = While heading through town, Bean feels an itch in his foot. To relieve the itch he removes his shoe and sock and places them on the roof of a parked Mazda 323, only for the car to drive off with them. Bean finds himself forced to hop through town trying to find them, briefly stopping in a shop to find a shoe that matches his own but being unable to buy just one shoe when the salesman insists he buys a pair. Chasing after the car, Bean eventually manages to jump in front of it, causing his shoe and sock to fall off and into his grasp, and leaving him to thank the driver. = Act 4: The Photo Booth, the Club and Night Disco = Walking through town at night, Bean attempts to comb his hair in a shop window, but has difficulty combing the back of his head. To resolve the problem, he uses an ID photo booth to photograph the back of his head, before heading off to a nightclub called \\"Club Phut\\" (the word was previously seen as graffiti at the start of \\"The Return of Mr. Bean\\"), meeting up with his girlfriend Irma Gobb (also played by Ziegler). As they head inside, Bean is irritated by the club's flashing neon sign so hits the power box for the sign, causing it to stop flashing and eventually cut out. Inside, the pair enter the stage area where a magic act is being performed by a magician named Eddie Spangle. Trying to attract the attention of a waitress, Bean inadvertently becomes a volunteer in the magic show. He soon causes mayhem when the magician uses his watch for a magic trick, and messes up some of the magician's magical gimmicks while searching for his watch, much to Irma's embarrassment. Upon retrieving it but seeing his girlfriend gone, Bean heads out and into the club's dancefloor while Spangle angrily searches for him after he ruined his show. Inside the disco, Bean finds Irma dancing with another man. Jealous, Bean tries to butt in and take back Irma, who ignores him again and simply continues dancing with the other man, eventually leading him to force the man out of the disco. Hoping to get Irma to dance with him, Bean asks the DJ to change the music to something romantic, only to find that the man returned and is embracing Irma. Heartbroken and humiliated, Bean exits the disco but, unwilling to be beaten, he spots the club's power breaker and shuts it off on his way out. In the ending scene, Bean passes by a shop with televisions in its display window on his way home, which go to static when he passes them and return to normal, even when he sticks his hand in front of them after the ending credits.  Cast  * Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean * Matilda Ziegler as Irma Gobb and the policewoman * Nick Hancock as the camera thief * Robin Driscoll as the police sergeant * Dursley McLinden as the Shoe Salesman * Alan Shaxon as Eddie Spangle * Julia Howson as Monique * Richard Marcangelo and Howard Goodall as musicians * Mark Khan and Phil Nice as disco dancers  Production  The day after the original transmission of this episode, Thames Television ‚Äì which originally commissioned and broadcast the series on behalf of the ITV network ‚Äì learned it would lose its broadcast franchise at the end of the following year. As an independent production company, Thames continued its involvement with the series after 1992 but the network commission and compliance responsibility was handed over to Central Independent Television, who also oversaw a number of Thames' independent productions for the ITV network. \\"Three Standing Figures\\" sculpture in Battersea Park The location sequences in this episode were filmed at Battersea Park and Kingston upon Thames. Exterior scenes outside Mr. Bean's flat were filmed in Surbiton for several episodes in the series. The location scenes also switched from using OB videotape to 35 mm film. Studio sequences were recorded before a live audience at Thames Television's Teddington Studios. Elements from this episode were later reused in episodes of Mr. Bean: The Animated Series: * The television sketch inspired the episode Big TV. * The scene in which Bean was distracted by the thief while he took his photo was adapted as part of a scene in the episode Chocks Away. * The police line- up scene was used as inspiration for the ending scene of the episode In the Pink. * The magician scene inspired by the episode A Magic Day Out.  Censorship  The broadcast of the episode on the Philippine television ABS- CBN, Nickelodeon UK and Disney Channel, removed two segments in the television sketch ‚Äì where when Bean pushes wires into the plug for the television, and removes his trousers and underwear and sat down in the chair completely naked by covering himself up privately.

She was daughter of Hino Shigemasa and the official wife of Ashikaga Yoshimasa, the 8th sh≈çgun of the Ashikaga shogunate (at first Tomiko was betrothed to Ashikaga Yoshikatsu the 7th sh≈çgun but Yoshikatsu died at age of 10), and the mother of Ashikaga Yoshihisa, the 9th sh≈çgun. Her efforts in succession dispute are seen as one of the causes of the ≈ånin War and led to the begin of the Sengoku period.  Early life  Hino Tomiko was born into the Hino family, a powerful family whose women became consorts to many previous Shoguns. These familial connections enhanced the Hino's power to control the Shogunate Court. Tomiko was important to strengthen the Hino family relationship with the Shogunate and grow ever more powerful. When Tomiko's social and political status emerged after her marriage to Ashikaga Yoshimasa, she decided to stay active in the shogunal government. She had her first child at ninth day of the first month of 1459, however, the child died at same day. Later she placed the blame for the child's death on it's wet nurse, Imaimairi no Tsubone, later exiled to Oki Island on Lake Biwa and committed suicide.  ≈ånin War  In 1460, Yoshimasa decided to abdicate his position as Shogun. However, since Tomiko had not given birth to an heir, Yoshimasa convinced his younger brother Ashikaga Yoshimi to succeed him, first in office and then gradually claiming the title of Shogun. Tomiko was against it, although at the time she had no influence to contest Yoshimi's appointment, she stood at war with the shogunate officers and decided to rule until the birth of an heir. When she gave birth to the future Ashikaga Yoshihisa made her the mother of the future shogun. Tomiko went looking for military support to make sure the next successor was from her family lineage. She got support from the Ouchi, Hatakeyama, Shiba and others clans. With her standing in the Hino family, and backed by Yamana Sozen, two clans developed in the capital, Hosokawa clan supporting the newly appointed Shogun, Yoshimi, and the Yamana clan the succession of Yoshihisa. Thus, this desire of Tomiko to place her son in line for the succession led to the ≈ånin War. In popular culture She has been the subject of novels by Ry≈çtar≈ç Shiba and Michiko Nagai.

The group works as a rudo (term used for wrestlers who portray the \\"bad guys\\") faction and often teams together for tag team or Trios (three man team) matches. The storyline behind team is that they are all sons of one of the original Los Capos, Cien Caras and M√°scara A√±o 2000, although only one of the four members have been confirmed as being a blood relative while two others were definitely not. The stable includes Cien Caras Jr. (not a son), Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 (possibly a son) and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. (a son). El Hijo de Cien Caras was a part of the group until his death in 2010. Los Capos have at times also been billed as Los Hermanos Dinamita (\\"The Dynamite Brothers\\") leading this team being called Los Hermanos Dinamita Junior or Los Junior Dinamitas. History Los Junior Capos started out with two wrestlers who paid Carmelo Reyes Gonz√°lez, better known under the ring name Cien Caras for the use of his ring name and mask design to become Cien Caras Jr. and El Hijo de Cien Caras (Literally \\"The Son of Cien Caras\\"). The two first bega working together in Guadalajara, Jalisco where they had both previous worked under other identities. Early on in the life of Los Junior Capos the duo defeated Flash I and Flash IINeither of them are to be confused with Fuego, who worked as Flash before changing his name. to win the Occidente (\\"Western\\") Tag Team Championship on December 11, 2005. In the subsequent years Los Capos Junior would only defend the tag team titles on a few occasions, against the team of El Sagrado and El Texano Jr. in 2006 and Leon Blanco and Rayman in 2007. The fact that the team held the championship for a total of 545 days is more a reflection of how infrequent the titles were defended and Los Capos Junior working together than anything else. Their reign was ended on March 25, 2007 when El Sagrado and Rayman defeated them to win the belts. Around 2007/2008 Los Capos Junior began working for International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) where they began teaming with M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr., son of M√°scara A√±o 2000, and thus \\"storyline\\" cousin of Los Junior Capos. In IWRG Hijo de Cien Caras and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. teamed together on a regular basis, and on May 31, 2007 they defeated the team of El Felino and La Pantera to win the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. This marked the beginning of what would be the longest reign of any IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Champions, 801 days in total. For over two years Los Capos Junior defended such teams as Electroshock and El Hijo de An√≠bal, Pierroth and Hijo del Pierroth, El Hijo del Solitario and Hijo de An√≠bal, Heavy Metal and Negro Casas, Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Hijo de An√≠bal, Dr. Wagner Jr. and Silver King, Los Cowboys (Silver King and El Dandy), El Fantasma and Fantasma Jr., Scorpio Jr. and Zumbido (twice), Alrquin and Hijo del Pierroth and Los Headhunters between 2007 and 2009. On August 9, 2009 they lost the championship to Scorpio Jr. and Ricky Cruzz. In April, 2010 the Mexico State wrestling commission stripped the team of Black Terry, Dr. Cerebro and Cerebro Negro of the Distrito Federal Trios Championship as Cerebro Negro had not wrestled in the State of Mexico for 90 days. Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. teamed up with their father for the tournament, qualifying for the finals by defeating first the team of Chico Che, Ultraman Jr. and Zatura and then Brazo de Plata, Brazo Met√°lico and Hijo del Brazo de Plata to qualify for the finals of the tournament. The following week Los M√°scaras A√±o 2000 lost to the team of Los Gringos VIP (Avisman, El Hijo del Diablo and Gringo Loco) in the finals of the tournament. AAA wrestler Silver King showed up for the show, allegedly to promote the movie \\"Nacho Libre II\\" but ended up starting an interpromotional feud between AAA and IWRG. Los Junior Dinamitas quickly came to the defense of IWRG, wrestling against Silver King and other AAA representatives such as Alex Koslov, Chessman and Cibern√©tico. During AAA's Tripleman√≠a XVIII Los Junior Dinamitas made a surprise appearance moments after Silver King and √öltimo Gladiador won the AAA World Tag Team Championship to challenge the new champions. This marked the first time IWRG wrestlers appeared on AAA television. On June 26, 2010 the team of Hijo de Cien Caras and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. regained the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship when they defeated the team of Pirata Morgan and Hijo de Pirata Morgan. Los Junior Capos did challenge for the AAA World Tag Team Championship on August 19, 2010 but were defeated by champions Silver King and Ultimo Maniaco. The tag team championship reign lasted until November of that year when Los Piratos regained the titles. On November 29, 2010 Hijo de Cien Caras, was assassinated in Coyoac√°n, Mexico City. Until the death of Hijo de Cien Caras Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 had only worked with the rest of Los Capos Juniors on occasion, but became a regular member of the trio afterwards. In September, 2011 IWRG held a trios tournament to determine the next challengers for the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship. In the preliminary round Los Capos Junior outlasted the teams of Los Perros del Mal (Bestia 666, Damian 666 and X-Fly) and Los Psycho Circus (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown) to earn a match for the championship at a later date. On December 1, 2011 Los Capos Junior defeated Los Perros del Mal to win the IWRG Intercontinental Championship. On December 16, 2011, at AAA's Guerra de Titanes pay-per-view, M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. formed the stable El Consejo (\\"The Council\\", referring to CMLL without using the acronym) with former CMLL workers El Texano Jr. and Toscano. Following the event M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. teamed less with the other Capos Junior and more with El Consejo, but did team up with them on May 27, 2012 where the trio lost the Trios championship to La Familia de Tijuana (Damian 666, Headhunter A and X-Fly). In March 2011 Cien Caras Jr. and Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 participated in Universal Wrestling Entertainment's (UWE) Tag Team Championship tournament. In the first round they defeated the team of Scorpio Jr. and Zumbido, in the quarter finals they defeated the team of Los Psycho Circus (Murder Clown and Psycho Clown), but lost their semi-final match to Los Guerreros del Infierno (Atlantis and √öltimo Guerrero).

It was first broadcast on ITV on 1 January 1992 and watched by 18.74 million viewers on its original broadcast, making it the highest-rated episode in the series.  Plot = Act 1: The Dentist = Mr. Bean's alarms go off at 8:00 am, but he continues to lie in his bed while ignoring the chimes of his grandfather clock, dunking a battery-powered alarm clock into a nearby glass of water and stopping a hose spraying hot water from his teasmade by plugging it with the big toe on his right foot. Eventually, Bean gets up 50 minutes later, conducts some light exercise, brings out his clothes and then has difficulty shaving when his electric razor catches his nasal hairs. Upon noticing a reminder that he has a dental appointment, he suddenly realises he is running late and proceeds to grab his clothes, his shoes, his toothbrush and toothpaste and heads for his Mini, coming back suddenly to ensure his cuddly toy, Teddy, is tucked in bed. Rushing for the appointment, Bean proceeds to get dressed while driving, using a brick on the accelerator for some of the journey alongside his feet for the steering before eventually brushing his teeth, using the car's screenwash to rinse his mouth out before spitting it out, the contents landing on the buttocks of a local builder, who initially mistakes it for bird droppings. Arriving at the dental surgery of Mr. A. M. Peggit in the nick of time, Bean parks out front, forcing the blue Reliant out of the only parking space. A traffic warden then appears, prepares to ticket the Reliant and makes Bean notice that a part of his pyjamas is sticking out of his trousers, forcing him to remove it and toss it in his car window. Once inside the waiting room, he can't find anything good to read other than a Batman comic book in the hands of a young boy who refuses to share the book, and tricks the boy's mother into thinking he has wet himself by pouring water from a vase onto his lap in order to get the comic ‚Äì only to find he has no time to read it as the dentist is now ready to see him. Inside with Mr. Peggit, Bean causes mayhem behind the dentist's back, adjusting the dental chair to unusual positions and messing about with some of the equipment. Eventually, he accidentally injects the dentist's leg with a needle containing a dose of anaesthetic, causing him to fall over and then pull down an X-ray blocker, knocking him out. Feeling inconvenienced by this, Bean decides to do what the dentist was planning to do ‚Äì put a filling into his tooth. Although he manages to do this, he soon finds that the holder containing the dental map of his teeth can flip vertically and horizontally thus leaving him to drill each tooth and put filling on all of them, effectively causing them to be stuck together. Fortunately, Bean gets a fright when Mr. Peggit wakes up and this is enough to free his jaws. Satisfied with his own work, he leaves the dentist to enjoy the rest of the day. = Act 2: The Picnic = Following his dental appointment, Bean drives to the public park to have a picnic. The car park is full except for a gap between two cars only just wide enough for his Mini yet with no room to open the door, so he gets out and pushes his car into the gap. However, much to his annoyance, a car next to his car drives off. While passing by a boating lake, he spots a young boy having difficulty with his remote controlled boat. Offering to help, he opens up the controller and tweaks the circuitry inside, fixing the problem. Unbeknown to both Bean and the boy, the controller also takes control of an elderly man's electric wheelchair just behind them, which goes wherever the remote control boat goes. After hogging the controller for some time, Bean hands it back to the boy and leaves just as the now empty wheelchair approaches in behind him, pushing the boy into the lake (off-screen) just as Bean finds a nice spot. He soon begins setting up his picnic which consists of a large blanket, a portable transistor radio, a cake stand, a plate, a bottle of orange juice, a small chair, a book and a nice iced cupcake complete with a cherry on top. Unbeknown to him, a car thief breaks into his Mini and hotwires it, only to find the steering wheel is missing; Bean had removed it and had it with him in his picnic basket. As Bean prepares to read his book and eat his cake, a wasp suddenly buzzes around his spot and refuses to leave him alone, irritating him. He soon attempts to deal with it as he goes after his cake, swatting at it, jousting with it, chasing it around and even trying to drown it in his bottle of juice. Bean finally manages to kill it by tricking it into landing on the pages of his book and then quickly closing the book. Satisfied, he soon resumes what he was doing only to find an entire swarm of wasps coming for him, forcing him to abandon his picnic site as the end credits roll. Unable to lose them, Bean tosses his cake into a nearby car unaware that the car thief is now in it, who soon finds himself being targeted by the wasps. During this, the wheelchair from earlier stops by the car as the episode concludes.  Cast  * Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean * Richard Wilson as Mr. A. M. Peggit, the dentist * Caroline Quentin as The Traffic Warden * Sam Mead as the schoolboy * Christine Ellerbeck as The Schoolboy's Mother * Hugo Mendez as the Boy in the Park * Michael Godley as the Man in a Wheelchair * Nathan Lewis as the Car Thief * Bridget Brammall as the Dental Nurse  Production  Location scenes for this episode were shot on 35mm in Battersea Park, Kingston and Teddington, close to the Thames TV studios where studio sequences were recorded before a live audience. An extended upbeat remix of the choral theme was used for the driving sequence in Act 1. A number of inspired scenes and stories in Mr. Bean: The Animated Series: * The scene at the dentist inspired the story for the episode called \\"Toothache\\" * The scene between Mr. Bean and the wasp inspired a similar event for the episode \\"Artful Bean\\". * The scene in which Mr. Bean got his shaver stuck on his nasal hair was reused for the episode \\"Wanted\\". * The scene in which Mr. Bean stopped his coffeemaker waking him by plugging up the hose attached to it that sprayed hot water onto his feet was adapted as part of a scene in clock \\"Birthday Bear\\" A diagram of the clock and hose invention in this episode, also featured in the book Mr Bean's Diary, released in 1993. The Batman Comic held by the boy in Act 1 is Batman Volume 1, Issue 463.

He was a researcher (directeur de recherche) at the French National Centre for Scientific Research. His work focuses on moral philosophy and the philosophy of social science. He was the brother of Albert Ogien a sociologist. Biography Ogien was educated in Brussels, Tel Aviv, University of Cambridge, Paris, Columbia University and Montreal. Ruwen Ogien : \\" Ne pas nuire aux autres, rien de plus \\" par Roger-Pol Droit, Le Monde, mis en ligne le 16 juillet 2009. Trained in social anthropology, he wrote extensively on poverty and immigration. His thesis in philosophy, under the direction of Jacques Bouveresse, was published under the title The Weakness of the Will. His last areas of research are moral philosophy and the philosophy of social sciences. He was also interested in the philosophy of action, the notion of practical reason as well as practical irrationality. His other work was focused on the question of emotions, including hatred and shame. He was working to develop an ethical theory he called \\"minimal ethics.\\" This is an ethical anti-paternalistic theory which would give reason to minimize the areas of intervention of what he calls, following John Stuart Mill, the \\"moral police\\". Minimal ethics arose initially in the form of three principles: * Principle of equal consideration asks us to give the same value to everyone's voice; * Principle of neutrality towards conceptions of right and personal property * Principle of limited intervention in cases of egregious wrongs done.Ogien, Ruwen, La panique morale, Paris, Grasset, 2004, p. 30. Subsequently, Ogien tried to reduce it to one: \\"Do not harm others, nothing more\\" following this reasoning: * We have no moral duty towards ourselves. We only have moral duties towards others. * Moral duties towards others can be either positive (help doing good) or negative (do no harm). * The positive option can be expressed through charitable support, which may lead to paternalism - an attitude of wanting to do good for others regardless of their opinion. * To avoid paternalism, it is better to stick to one principle negative not to harm others. Finally, what Ogien called \\"minimal ethics\\" is an ethic that excludes moral duties to oneself and positive paternalistic duties towards others. It tends to be reduced to one principle of not harming others. In accordance with this general conception of ethics, it supports the freedom to do what one wants from his own life as long as we do not harm others, which implies that the decriminalization of drug use, all forms of sexual relations between consenting adults, and active assistance to die for those who make the request. A special issue of the Journal of Theology and Philosophy was devoted to minimal ethics. Ogien tried to relate ethics with similarly 'minimal' work on the moral development of children and the variability of moral systems in a book published in September 2011: The influence of the smell of croissants on human kindness and other matters of experimental moral philosophy.

It is so called because it was first published in Pak Lat, near Bangkok in Siam in two volumes. The provenance and chronology of the manuscripts of these two volumes are uncertain, and as of 2005, had not been analyzed in depth by a Burma Mon scholar. Scholarship, mainly by British colonial period historians, finds internal inconsistencies, and suggests the chronicles, judging by their vocabulary usage, were written in the late 19th century, probably after 1874. However, W.G. Cooper says the words could have been miscopied, and the original manuscripts might have been written much earlier as claimed.Aung- Thwin 2005: 148‚Äì149 It is a subject, Michael Aung-Thwin writes, that \\"needs a competent Burma Mon scholar to untangle properly.\\" Despite its problems, the chronicles have been referenced by later historians such as G.E. HarveyHarvey 1925: xviii and Nai Pan Hla.

PUPLHS Chorale is the resident choir of the PUP Laboratory High School. Started in 2003, it is now part of a larger group, the PUPLHS Music Collective. The PUPLHS Chorale has won numerous accolades and citations, locally and internationally, including diplomas from the 4th Voyage of Songs International Chorale Festival and 1st Vietnam International Choir Festival and Competition. History The Polytechnic University of the Philippines Laboratory High School Chorale was formally established in 2003 by a PNU graduate, Mr. Jonathan A. Jarin. The group sang for the monthly catholic masses at the PUP Interfaith Chapel and the school's programs until they joined Rotary Club of Makati's ‚ÄúTouch Another Filipino Soul‚Äù District Youth Choral Competition in 2005. They won 3rd place at the said competition. Their first success was followed by engagements in local competitions. In 2007, they were 2nd runner-up in the Philippine School of Business Administration's ‚ÄúIsang Himig, Isang Tinig‚Äù competition and 1st Runner Up in Philippine Tour Operators Association's 20th Philippine Travel Mart Eco Chorale Competition. In 2010, they joined Eat Bulaga ‚ÄúSa Pula, Sa Puti‚Äù and Philippine Travel Mart Eco Chorale Competition's High School Division and got the first place prize in both contests. On the same year, they also joined Pasig City's ‚ÄúPaskong Himig‚Äù and place 3rd, defeating other university and high school choirs. The chorale competed in the Himig Handog Choral Competition at Tagum City last February 2012 and placed third in the Youth Category. PUPLHS Chorale also joined international choir festivals and won awards. In July 2009, the group earned Silver B Certificates in Folklore and Chamber Categories at the 4th ‚ÄúA Voyage of Songs‚Äù competition held in Penang, Malaysia. They also won a Gold diploma from the 1st Vietnam International Choir Festival and Competition held in Hoi An, Quang Nam, Vietnam and placed second in Mixed Youth Choir Category. The group won Silver Medal for the Youth Category and Gold Medal for the Spiritual Category at the 1st Guam Pacific Choral Festival in May 2013. The choir also performs to Filipinos abroad whenever they join these competitions. Due to their achievements, the chorale was invited to perform for different personalities and institutions, including Ms Lani Misalucha, President Benigno Simeon Aquino III and the Malacanan Palace, Department of Foreign Affairs, City of Calauan, Development Academy of the Philippines, Emilio Aguinaldo College, Young Men's Christian Association, Resorts World Manila, GO NEGOSYO!, ABS-CBN (Umagang Kay Ganda), GMA (Eat Bulaga, 24 Oras, Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho, News To Go), TV5 (Sapul sa Singko) Solar News Channel and other media institutions. Then-first lady and now Calauan Mayor Baby Berries also invited the chorale to interpret their town hymn. PUPLHS Chorale also showed devotion into helping others. The choir visited and sang for the Silong Tanglaw Orphanage in 2011. The group rendered songs for a Medical Mission and a Home for the Aged Outreach Program at Tagum City in 2013. To promote choral singing among the youth, the chorale also hosted two seminar-workshops in development of successful of choirs in 2012. Held in October and November, the choir taught the members of the Makati Science High School and Tanong High School Choirs. In 2013, the PUPLHS Chorale performed alongside other performing groups in a concert-for-a cause hosted by the university. The chorale co-headlined the Voices II concert with PNU Chorale at PAGCOR Grand Theater in November 2011. In 2013, they celebrated their 10th founding anniversary at the Philam Life Theater with a concert entitled ‚ÄúCommitted‚Äù. Jarin resigned from his post as choirmaster and music teacher in 2014.

While British Army influence has always been strong, distinctive New Zealand features have gradually developed. From 2013 the New Zealand Army uniform underwent a complete redesign with a new and distinctive camouflage pattern unique to the NZDF. Uniforms of the New Zealand Wars During the New Zealand Wars of 1846‚Äì1886, settler militia and Maori allies in a variety of clothing styles served alongside the British Imperial forces who wore their red and blue undress uniforms until plain dark blue field uniforms were adopted after 1860. Uniform consisted of ‚Äúblue shirt, a cap similar to that worn by sailors, and any kind of trousers‚Äù. Maoris served throughout the wars in the 1860s, generally in tribal groups, or as members of the European volunteer forces.'The Militia', from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A. H. McLintock, originally published in 1966. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand URL: http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/1966/defence-armed-services-army-new- zealand/page-2 (accessed 10 Mar 2020) In the later stages of the Land Wars the government passed the Armed Constabulary Act of 1867, replacing the British Regular and local militia regiments. The Armed Constabulary had combined military and police functions and was the forerunner of both the NZ Army and the New Zealand Police. Members wore a blue woollen uniform with a red stripe down the trouser seam and a kepi-like headdress. In the field this was often worn with a kilt or MƒÅori Piupiu for convenience in wading across streams and rivers. By 1870 the last British regiment had left New Zealand.

The usual headdress however was the Australian style slouch hat, worn at this stage in its history without the turned-up brim. The New Zealand and other colonial contingents in this war affected a more casual dress style than the more strictly disciplined British regulars. Volunteers and Territorial Army Highland doublet - Auckland Rifle Volunteers, Gordon Highlanders, circa 1900 The Volunteers were created by the Militia Act of 1858, and continued until 1910. The force consisted of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, and was usually formed for specific tasks and duties. The various volunteer militia units in existence until 1910 wore a variety of scarlet, dark blue or rifle-green dress uniforms, generally closely following contemporary British Army patterns. Some units, recruited in coastal areas, favored Royal Navy style dress. The Volunteer forces became unpopular and the Defence Act of 1909 called for the Volunteer Force to be replaced by a Territorial Force manned through compulsory military service.'Volunteers and the Special Reports Era', from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A. H. McLintock, originally published in 1966. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand URL: http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/1966/defence-armed-services-army-new- zealand/page-4 (accessed 10 Mar 2020) Since 1902 a khaki serge service uniform had been general issue. The regional regiments of the new Territorial Army, which replaced the militia, wore the universal \\"1912 Uniform\\" of khaki in a greenish/brown shade, worn with a slouch hat. Officers frequently wore the peaked cap of the British Army. Units were distinguished by regimental badges attached to the turned up brim of the hat; and branches by colored piping on tunic shoulder straps and trouser seams. Dark blue dress uniforms were authorised for officers and members of the small Permanent Staff (regular cadre). World War I uniforms New Zealand troops after the Battle of Messines, 1917 New Zealand's Territorial Force formed the basis of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) sent to help the British in World War I although there was no formal military connection between the Territorials and the NZEF. Most volunteers who joined the NZEF had received military training in the Territorials.'First World War military formations', URL: https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/first-world-war-military-formations, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 2-May-2017 From 1914-1915 New Zealand soldiers wore the Territorial Force uniform issued in 1912. Coloured piping on the shoulders of the New Zealand-made jackets indicated branch of service. During the Gallipoli campaign New Zealand troops wore a variety of hot-weather khaki drill uniforms with either slouch hats or the Peaked cap of the British Army.'NZ infantry uniform, 1914-15', URL: https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/nz-infantry-uniform-1914-1915, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 13-Jan-2016 Supply difficulties and the harsh nature of terrain and climate during this campaign meant that little emphasis was placed on smartness or uniformity of dress. After the Gallipoli campaign the New Zealand Expeditionary Force replaced the Territorial Force uniform with khaki uniforms of British style together with the distinctive campaign hat that would come to be nicknamed the \\"lemon squeezer\\" in New Zealand. The \\"lemon squeezer\\" was adopted by the Wellington Regiment about 1911 and became general issue for all New Zealand units during the latter stages of World War I. The different branches of service were distinguished by coloured puggaree or wide bands around the base of the crown (blue and red for artillery, green for mounted rifles, khaki and red for infantry etc.). The uniforms worn on the Western Front included a mounted service pattern greatcoat, the Brodie helmet when in combat, and the universal combat boots and puttees wrapped around the legs. The conspicuous coloured branch facings were phased out after 1916, although surviving on the campaign hats. Inter- war period alt=Two Maori officers wearing military uniforms smile at the camera, surrounded by other soldiers in front of a building The reduced peace- time New Zealand forces of the period 1920‚Äì39 retained what was essentially a smartened version of the Western Front uniform of 1916‚Äì18. Puttees however were replaced by short anklets during the 1930s and a dark-blue dress uniform was approved in 1938 to encourage voluntary recruiting for Territorial units. Only bands resumed the scarlet parade uniforms of the pre-1910 Volunteer era. The lemon squeezer with a wide range of coloured \\"pugaree\\" hat-bands to distinguish branches and units was retained in most orders of dress. Until mechanization, the Mounted Rifles regiments wore their own version of the slouch hat, with a green pugaree. World War II uniforms New Zealand troops wearing British battle dress inspect a disabled German tank, Tobruk 1941 Maori New Zealander troops in Egypt, 1941 During the earlier stages of the War the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force wore the traditional \\"lemon squeezer\\" Campaign hat with the universal \\"NZ\\" badge. The hat with its conspicuous coloured pugarees and wide rigid brim was largely replaced by more practical forage caps and berets during the Italian Campaign of 1943‚Äì44. A high-collared khaki service uniform, drawn from peace-time issue, was soon replaced by British battle dress in common with other Commonwealth forces (with the exception of Australia.) In late 1939 large scale manufacture of Battle dress uniforms was started in New Zealand by numerous local clothing manufacturers. The New Zealand version was almost identical to British 1937 pattern, made in Serge twill but of a darker brown, while the stitching was a contrasting light colour. The NZ blouse had a six button fly front, rather than the British five.https://kiwisoldier.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/27th-machine-gun-battalion- uniform/ In North Africa the New Zealanders wore light khaki Drill cotton short-sleeved shirts and shorts. During the Pacific Campaign in 1943‚Äì1944, members of the 3rd New Zealand Division were issued New Zealand-designed and manufactured light-weight khaki shirts and pants in plain drill material. A second New Zealand-made blouse with four front pockets in a camouflage pattern consisting of dark green, chocolate brown, black, and lime green was issued for combat use.https://kiwisoldier.wordpress.com/2016/01/19/2nd-new-zealand- expeditionary-force/ In combat the Brodie helmet was also worn.

In Borneo in 1966, the New Zealand rifle companies wore coloured bands on their jungle hats as a means of recognising and identifying friendly forces in the jungle. The C Company band was black. C Company and D Company formed the basis of the first infantry deployment into Vietnam, Victor Company, with black becoming the colour of the company. When Victor Company arrived in 1967 the Company members wore a black cravat embroidered with a small white Kiwi bird. At first this was worn as part of the formal dress (although never official) but as the \\"JGs\\" worn by New Zealand were almost identical to their Australian counterparts, the cravat was then sometimes worn on operations to distinguish the New Zealanders from the Australians, especially with the first and second Victor companies. The New Zealand artillery battery serving in Vietnam also used a black cravat with an embroidered white Kiwi bird for both dress uniform and sometimes as field wear.'The Black Scarves' URL: https://vcoy67.org.nz/scarves.htm (Victor Company Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment Vietnam 1967: The Originals)'Royal New Zealand Artillery cravat', URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/photo/royal-new-zealand-artillery-cravat, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 28-Apr-2011 New Zealand adopted Australian JGs from 1967 and were initially supplied from 1 ATF stocks. Subsequent New Zealand-made JGs were made with one difference in that the shirt pocket flaps were V-shaped and the pockets pleated, otherwise they were identical. In 1968, the Australian military replaced the straight breast pockets of their field shirts with slanted pockets and the shirt was designed to be worn outside of the trousers, in the style of American jungle fatigues. Additional pockets were placed on the upper sleeves of the shirt.

Having been in abeyance since the 1950s, the \\"lemon squeezer\\" was reintroduced for ceremonial wear in 1977.Malcolm Thomas and Cliff Lord, page 129 Part One, New Zealand Army Distinguishing Patches 1911‚Äì1991, British Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) was adopted in 1980 as the camouflage pattern for clothing. The new camouflage uniforms were in the British 1968 Pattern, fully replacing the olive-green Australian JGs. The original DPM colours were further modified several times to better suit New Zealand conditions. This evolved pattern is now officially referred to as New Zealand disruptive pattern material (NZDPM.) Soldiers wearing NZDPM uniforms, first introduced in 1980 In the mid-1990s a quantity of British windproof smocks were purchased as the indigenously developed DPM camouflage woollen \\"Swanndri\\" had never really found favour due to its weight (especially when wet), bulk and impractical cut. In 1997 a new uniform was issued which resembled the cut of the British \\"Combat Soldier 95\\" jungle DPM shirt and trousers. The shirt and trousers feature double knees, elbows and seat. Rank slides were worn on the shoulders. NZDPM remained the camouflage pattern. A lightweight 100% cotton NZDPM windproof smock was issued, which had a rank slide on the front, covered buttons and an integral hood. A wide brimmed khaki slouch hat with green puggaree, of a pattern formerly worn by the New Zealand Mounted Rifle regiments, replaced the khaki \\"No 2\\" British Army peaked cap as Service dress uniform headdress for all branches in 1998.

The universal mess dress also replaced the white jacket and black Barathea trousers previously worn in summer or tropical cClimates. The mess uniform is based on the British \\"infantry pattern\\" mess uniform. The dark blue \\"No 1\\" dress uniform formerly worn by officers before the general adoption of mess uniforms, was last worn in the early 1990s, although it was nominally retained for wear by the chief of army on appropriate state occasions. Scarlet and blue full dress uniforms of slightly differing patterns are worn by both the New Zealand Army Band and the Officer Cadet School, together with \\"lemon squeezer\\" hats respectively in khaki or dark blue. Highland orders of dress (glengarry, kilt, and sporrans) are authorised for wear by the New Zealand Scottish Squadron of the RNZAC, at the discretion of the squadron commander. They are also authorised for the pipes and drums of the 5th (Wellington, West Coast and Taranaki) Battalion Group. 21st Century uniforms General trends over the past two decades have included the appearance of distinctive New Zealand features in uniform details, combined with the reduction of corps and regimental distinctions in favor of standardised items of dress for reasons of supply rationalization and economy. With the adoption of the Army Combat Uniform (ACU) by the United States in the mid 2000s many, if not most, world militaries have been influenced by the concept and cut of the uniform and have copied it to varying degrees. The ACU has had an influence too on New Zealand uniform changes during the 21st Century. Until 2002, berets were in various colours according to branch or unit. Since then, under a \\"one beret\\" policy, rifle-green has become the universal colour for this headdress, except for the tan beret of the New Zealand Special Air Service and the blue beret of the New Zealand Defence Force Military Police. The dark blue (formerly red) sashes worn by sergeants are now embroidered with a traditional MƒÅori motif or mokowaewae denoting speed and agility.http://www.army.mil.nz/about-us/who-we- are/structure/uniforms/ceremonial-service-dress.htm On the infantry sash, the mokowaewae appears in black, white and red diagonal 'steps', and on that of the New Zealand Scottish, in green, black and white. Short MƒÅori cloaks are sometimes worn by senior officers as a mark of distinction on occasions of special ceremony, though they are not part of the regulation uniform.

During his career in the Senate, Graham supported the creation of a state sales tax and aggressively railed against inefficiency and corruption in state government. In 1956, Richard I. Furbush did not run for re-election and Graham sought to succeed him as Senate President. At the Republican caucus held before the floor vote, Graham defeated Newland H. Holmes fifteen votes to six. However, Holmes chose not to abide by the caucus decision and ran against Graham and Democratic leader John E. Powers for the Senate Presidency. On the first ballot, Powers received the vote of all nineteen Democrats while the Republican vote was split between Graham (sixteen votes) and Holmes (five votes). Powers preferred Holmes to Graham and after a lengthy caucus with the Democrats, he was able to convince fifteen Democrats to support Holmes. On the second ballot, Holmes won the Presidency with twenty votes to Graham's sixteen and Powers' four. In 1960 and 1964, Graham ran for Governor of Massachusetts, but lost the nomination to John A.

Similar period Pali chronicles include the Chamadevivamsa and the Mulasasana. Originally written in Pali by a Buddhist monk, it is said to have been completed in 1527 but the oldest extant manuscript dates only to 1788. The chronicle was one of the Chiang Mai-based chronicles maintained during the Burmese rule of Lan Na (1558‚Äì1775) and it was referenced by later Burmese chronicles, most notably Maha Yazawin, the standard chronicle of Toungoo Dynasty.Aung-Thwin 2005: 124‚Äì126 The oldest extant manuscript of 1788 is written in a late Khmer script, and has gone through at least a dozen revisions. It was translated to Khmer and translated \\"from Khmer to Thai to Pali to French and back again to Pali.\\" The chronicle was revised at least four times during the Chakri Dynasty. The Thai-language version by King Mongkut's reign was no longer a verbatim copy of the 1788 copy, having incorporated early Thai nationalist narratives. It was finally translated into English in 1968 by N.A. Jayawickrama. Thus, the English version today is a \\"compendium of knowledge of several different ages and places, rather than of a singular time and place.\\" The chronicle continues to be of interest to Burma scholars. In its \\"secular section\\" about early kings, the chronicle extols most about the conquests of King Anawrahta of Pagan Dynasty. The author credits Anawrahta's role as a great Buddhist king into bringing Theravada Buddhism to present-day northern Thailand.

Rire & Chansons maintains two sub-feeds for R√©union and Tahiti areas; each of the feeds carry entirely separate programming content & schedule from the national feed. History Rire & Chansons is created by Jean-Paul Baudecroux in 1989 in Paris on the Parisian frequency of the defunct radio station Pacific FM, which was acquired by the NRJ Group and the frequencies were redistributed to Ch√©rie FM.

The entire network is created with the support of Marc Z√©nou, president of the SNRP (Syndicat national des radios priv√©es, National Union of Private Radio) and head of Radio Star (Mulhouse) and Radio Service. The local programs disappeared to give way to non-presenter programs identified by the slogan \\"la radio du rire\\". In 1997, NRJ forced the hand of the CSA which had not yet authorized the group to create a new national network. The program of affiliated radios is renamed Rire & Chansons. After negotiations, NRJ pledged to maintain local stations and their staff, and the CSA officially authorized the creation of the network. In 1999, following the acquisition of Nostalgie by NRJ, the CSA forced NRJ to close down Rire & Chansons' local stations. This decision will allow NRJ to maintain a national network at a lower cost, without the need to fulfill the cost of local staffers in the network. In 2000, Rire & Chansons welcomes Philippe Bouvard after his temporary replacement at the head of Les Grosses T√™tes on RTL. From 2003 to 2012, the radio was signalized by prank calls of the animator and humorist G√©rald Dahan. Several political figures such as Jean-Pierre Raffarin or Nicolas Sarkozy and sports figures like Raymond Domenech and Zin√©dine Zidane were trapped. February 22, 2012, after the disclosure on the Internet of a wrong call to the detriment of the candidate for the French presidential election of 2012, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the radio decides to stop his collaboration with the animator. In September 2011, following the eviction of Laurent Baffie from Europe 1, the station offers him a chance to host C'est quoi ce bordel ? show on air every Sunday morning at 11. The show closed down in January 2013.

Constructed in secret, they were tested by Reichswehr units at the Kama tank school in the Soviet Union. They were used for training and retired as monuments after the Nazi party came to power.Peter Chamberlin and Hillary Doyle, Encyclopedia of German Tanks of World War Two, 1978, 1999, p. 147 Development history After the first World War, Germany realized the usefulness of tanks in warfare. In 1925, plans to design tanks for the Reichswehr were secretly initiated. The Grosstraktor was the first of the tank designs for the Reichswehr. The Grosstraktor began life when design specifications for a tank known as the \\"Armeewagen 20\\" were created in 1926. It was to be a 15 tonne tank armed with a 7.5 cm gun in a fully rotating turret and having a length of 6 meters and a width of 2.4 meters. Contracts to design and build two chassis in soft steel were given to Daimler-Benz, Krupp, and Rheinmetall in March 1927. Krupp designed a turret for their own vehicle, while Rheinmetall designed a turret for both their own and Daimler-Benz's tanks. Construction of the six Grosstraktor was started at a Rheinmetall shop in Unterl√º√ü in August 1928, and was completed by the end of June 1929. They were then shipped to a secret testing ground near Kazan, Russia for trials, arriving in July 1929.

He was born and raised in Quebec, where his experiences with Nintendo games in his youth would later influence his game design. He studied game design at the Montreal National Animation and Design Centre, and worked at Ubisoft and Artificial Mind and Movement before starting Polytron in 2008. Fish was a founding member of Kokoromi, a collective that explores experimental gameplay ideas, and organized Montreal's annual GAMMA games events. While Fez was in development, Fish worked on other unreleased games at Polytron including SuperHyperCube and Power Pill. Fez was released in April 2012 to widespread acclaim after a protracted five-year development cycle. Its final phases of development were shown in the 2012 documentary Indie Game: The Movie, which brought Fish fame unusual for game developers. Following an online argument and doxxing, Fish publicly announced his exit from game development twice over the next two years, citing long-term mistreatment by the industry. Polytron later published the 2015 Panoramical, and Fish returned with Kokoromi to release SuperHyperCube in 2016.  Early life and career  Phil Fish was born Philippe Poisson in Montreal in 1984. He was raised in Quebec, where his parents shared their interest in art and gaming with him. Fish's father translated The Legend of Zelda into French so the two could play together. Fish credits these memories as formative, and later cited their influence on Fez. He graduated from the 2004 Design and Digital Art for Video Games program at the Montreal NAD (National Animation and Design Centre). Fish began his career at the video game publisher Ubisoft, where he worked on Open Season as a level designer. He was initially excited for the job but grew disenchanted with their large development teams and working conditions. Fish later described it as \\"the worst experience of [his] life\\". He was later fired from the company. On May 24, 2006, Fish won the Artificial Mind and Movement Award for Best Cut-Scene at the annual NAD Center Awards of Excellence Gala. Later that year, Fish began work as a level designer at Artificial Mind and Movement, where he designed for film tie-in games including The Golden Compass. Fish (second from left) with Kokoromi in 2007 Fish is a founding member of Kokoromi, a group that designs and promotes experimental video games. His November 2006 Arcadia Festival event, GAMMA 01 Audio Feed, featured games that incorporated live sound. Fish planned a similar event, GAMMA 256, for 2007, and a third event, GAMMA 3D, for November 2008 in Montreal. Fish was invited to present a lecture on GAMMA 01 at the 2007 Game Developers Conference. He also wrote a review of the 1999 Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver in the 2007 book Space Time Play: Synergies Between Computer Games, Architecture and Urbanism: the Next Level. Additionally, Fish has been characterized by Sean Hollister of The Verge as \\"notorious for voicing angry, controversial opinions about the state of video games\\".  Polytron  Fish left Artificial Mind and Movement to set up Polytron Corporation, his indie startup company Fish began to work with Toronto-based indie developer Shawn McGrath on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game that showed 2D views of a 3D space. Fish provided the project's art until the partnership crumbled due to creative differences: Fish wanted their product to be more of a platform game. Fish continued to work on the game in his spare time, and incorporated the idea of voxels (3D pixels), where a 2D pixel could be seen from four sides. The game would become Fez and the game's design, lore, and art derived from this game mechanic. Fish searched for a programmer on DeviantArt and Renaud B√©dard, the first person to apply, became the game's programmer. Fez was first announced in July 2007 and was nominated for two awards at the 2008 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival. Fish's employer, Artificial Mind and Movement, would not let him take leave from work to attend, so Fish quit. He marked this January 2008 moment as \\"when I became indie\\". The game received widespread attention upon its showing at the festival, leading Fish to open Polytron Corporation as a startup company with a government loan. Polytron later ran out of money and was on the verge of folding when the company's Qu√©b√©cois neighbor, developer-producer Trapdoor, offered to help Polytron without transferring its intellectual property rights. According to Fish, the partnership saved Fez. The game was delayed several times over the next few years for which it received some notoriety. In late 2009, Polytron presented an iPhone game called Power Pill at Pecha Kucha Montreal. The game features a panacean pill that travels through human bodies as its playable protagonist, and it uses the iPhone's multi-touch screen. GameSetWatch Eric Caoili compared it to Soul Bubbles and Irritating Stick. The game was developed with Alec Holowka of Infinite Ammo, and a level editor was expected to be included. While working on Fez, Fish revived a game project called SuperHyperCube, which was based on Wiimote motion capture input and stereoscopic navigation. Fish felt the game would work better with the new Kinect motion tracking. The adapted game was a finalist at Indiecade 2011. alt=Four males from the development team stand with an atom-like trophy with a GDC backdrop. From left to right, Vreeland has long, messy hair, rectangular glasses, a TV static-like sweater, and is unshaven. His arm is around Fish, whose brown hair is combed back. He wears thick black glasses frames and a black shirt underneath a gray cardigan. McCartin has brownish-red hair and a goatee, and wears a Fez logo T-shirt underneath a red zippered hoodie. B√©dard is a head taller than the bunch, and has short, brown hair, rectangular glasses, and is unshaven. He wears a black and white checkered dress shirt, a black tie, and a zippered, black hoodie. Fish and Fez were featured prominently in the 2012 documentary Indie Game: The Movie, through which Fish received celebrity unusual for game developers. The film chronicles the stories of several indie developers at various stages of their games' development cycles, and Fish is shown preparing for Fez booth at PAX East in March 2011. The film presents Fish amidst a legal dispute with a former business partner that jeopardizes the game's release. The ex-partner, Jason DeGroot (a musician who contributed to the game), is portrayed negatively and is not shown on-screen. The film also tracks Fish's personal and emotional investment in the game. Eurogamer wrote that the scene where Fish resolves to kill himself if he does not release his game is \\"the film's most startling moment\\". Rock, Paper, Shotgun wrote that Fish is portrayed as melodramatic, existential, theatrical, and neurotic in contrast with the other developers shown in the film, which would exacerbate his outspoken public perception. Game Informer called Fish the film's \\"most memorable developer\\". Near the end of development, Fish felt \\"burnt out\\" and that his personal health had suffered. Fez was released on April 13, 2012 and sold 200,000 copies in its yearlong exclusivity to the Xbox Live Arcade platform. Video game review aggregator Metacritic described its reception as \\"generally favorable\\" and that of the 2013 PC version as \\"universal acclaim\\". While in development, Fez had won the 2012 GDC Independent Games Festival's Seamus McNally Grand Prize, the 2011 Indiecade Best in Show and Best Story/World Design, and the 2008 GDC Independent Games Festival's Excellence in Visual Art. Eurogamer awarded Fez a perfect score and named the \\"perfect, wordless sci-fi parable\\" their 2012 Game of the Year. The game sold one million copies by the end of 2013 and Fish announced eventual ports for most video game platforms. The New York Times Chris Suellentrop likened Fish to \\"a Quentin Tarantino of 8-bit gaming\\". = After Fez = A Fez sequel was announced as \\"one more thing\\" at end of the Horizon indie game press conference during the June 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo. A Twitter argument between Fish and GameTrailers journalist Marcus Beer a month later culminated in the project's cancellation and Fish's announced exit from the industry. In an episode of his show Invisible Walls, Beer had criticized Fish's recent response to questions about Microsoft's Xbox One self-publishing policy change. On Twitter, Fish condemned the industry for its negativity before his final tweet announced the cancellation and his leave. The news came as a surprise to the rest of Polytron, which has not commented on upcoming projects other than ports since the sequel's cancellation. Polygon listed Fish in their top 50 newsmakers of 2013 for the social power of his \\"caustic use of Twitter\\". In June 2014, Fish announced Polytron Partnersa new effort by Polytron to fund and support potential indie game efforts, like a publisher. For their first game, Polytron would work with Finji to provide the daily operations capacity for an \\"interactive musical landscape anthology\\" game named Panoramical. Fish was an early target of Gamergate. As part of the game developer harassment campaign, his personal and company records were hacked and released publicly in August 2014. Fish responded by announcing that the company and Fez property were for sale. After twice announcing his leave from the video game industry, Fish remained connected with Kokoromi. Together they finished SuperHyperCube in late 2016 as one of the first PlayStation VR games. He also designed the boot-up animations for the Analogue Super Nt console in 2017.

Starring Arie K. Untung, Indra Birowo, Deswita Maharani, and Kinaryosih, it follows two neighbours who steal a bra they think is magical. It was released to mixed critical reception. Plot Syamsul (Indra Birowo) and his wife Yuyun (Deswita Maharani) run an unsuccessful grocery store and are looking for a way to compete with that run by the friendly Ina (Kinaryosih), which is always full. Meanwhile, Sugeni (Arie K. Utung) is a chocolate salesman who wears a gorilla costume while working. As he is unsuccessful, his grandmother (Nani Widjaja) tells him to work as a transvestite. When this fails, the upset Sugeni throws away his grandmother's polka dot bra which he is wearing. It lands in front of Ina's shop. Ina, awakened by the noise, goes outside moments after Sugeni flees. Yuyun, a strong believer in the supernatural, sees Ina pick up the bra and assumes that she is praying to it; she credits these prayers for Ina's successful business. She tells Syamsul to steal the bra, and the following night they sneak into Ina's home and take all of the bras there. Sugeni, meanwhile, is scolded by his grandmother for losing her bra and must find it. The theft becomes a national sensation after it is reported, leading Syamsul to have nightmares. He attempts to throw the bra off the balcony, but is stopped by Yuyun. As they are fighting, Sugeni passes by and sees the bra before they finish their argument. That night he sneaks into Yuyun and Syamsul's home, dressed as a demon, to take the bra, but must leave after he is spotted. The following day Syamsul and Yuyun call a dukun (shaman) to exorcise their home; the dukun is actually Sugeni in disguise, and he tells Syamsul to discard the bra. When Syamsul does this, the bra is caught on a passing odong-odong (carriage). Yuyun cries out that the driver has stolen her bra, and the villagers chase the odong-odong and begin beating the driver. Yuyun, meanwhile, steals the bra. Afraid that they will be caught, Syamsul and Yuyun begin trying various schemes to get rid of the bra. When they try to leave it in the woods, Sugeni (in his gorilla costume) follows them and tries to take it. However, two park rangers see him and ‚Äì thinking he is a real gorilla ‚Äì shoot him with tranquillisers. He stumbles through the woods and takes refuge in a truck, which is on the way to Syamsul and Yuyun's shop to deliver supplies. Bakrie (Ence Bagus), the driver, delivers the boxes and, unknowingly, the bra, to the store. When Syamsul and Yuyun discover the bra, they are shocked. They then try to throw the bra in the sea, and bury it, but nothing works. Finally they burn it. Meanwhile, Sugeni ‚Äì who has realised that he lost the bra again ‚Äì meets a transvestite named Alfred, who directs him to a store in Blok M, where he discovers that the bra is in fact a rare model designed by Slamet Kartowardoyo. Sugeni buys a new one from the designer, but when he returns home he discovers that his grandmother has died. Sugeni then throws away the bra, and it ends up at Syamsul and Yuyun's home. The couple are now bankrupt, and Bakrie finds the bra. When Ina sees him picking it up she calls the police, who are able to unravel the whole story. Syamsul, Yuyun, and Bakrie move elsewhere, where they become rich selling bras. A year later, their old store has been occupied by a husband and wife (Andi Soraya and Epy Kusnandar). The couple has opened another grocery store. One night, as Alfred is passing, he wets himself in front of Ina's home and discards his panties there. When Ina tries to pick them up, the cycle starts again: the new neighbours think she is praying, and begin planning to steal the garment. Production Maling Kutang was directed by Rako Prijanto, best known for his comedies, and produced by Ody Mulya Hidayat of Maxima Pictures. The script was written by Raditya Dika, who had recently become popular after the success of his blog- turned-novel Kambing Jantan. A review of the film in The Jakarta Globe suggested that Dika had an \\"incongruous style of observational humour\\", which remained evident in Maling Kutang. Cinematography, which took less than a week, was handled by Rendra Yusworo, while editing was completed by Azis Natandra. Music was provided by Joseph S Djafar, with Yusuf A Patawari and Khikmawan Santosa on sound. The film starred Arie K. Untung, Indra Birowo, Deswita Maharani, and Kinaryosih, with minor roles played by actors including Fanny Fadillah and Nani Widjaja. In an interview, Kinaryosih ‚Äì who had several years' experience working in comedies ‚Äì stated that she had been told the title was Kutang Kutangkap (I Catch a Bra) during casting. The film's title is a play on Malin Kundang, a Minang folktale. Release and reception Maling Kutang was released on 1 October 2009, with a press screening at Jakarta Theater the day before. This was several weeks before Dika's Menculik Miyabi (Kidnapping Miyabi), starring AV idol Maria Ozawa, was scheduled to begin production. The film received a mixed reception. A review in The Jakarta Globe suggested that Maling Kutang was a \\"like a mere preview\\" for Menculik Miyabi. The reviewer praised several aspects of the film, including Untung's \\"Jim Carrey-esque\\" performance, and summarised that Maling Kutang was sufficient for \\"a few light laughs\\", but audiences might find it better to wait for Menculik Miyabi. A review on the entertainment website KapanLagi.com found the film better than its title suggested, with a clear plot and good performances by Birowo and Maharani, but considered the reliance on sexual innuendo to be poor form. Kartoyo DS, writing for Suara Karya, considered the comedy forced; he wrote that the film, unlike the Warkop comedies of the 1980s, did not produce any laughs.

It is housed in Saroornagar Palace, a palace of the Nizam of Hyderabad. The building is located 70-acre campus, located close to the Victoria Memorial metro station. History The Nizam of Hyderabad, Mahboob Ali Khan, had drawings made for a hunting lodge as early as 1882. The building was completed in 1903. However, the Nizam abandoned the palace on account of a superstition, as he fell ill soon after visiting the unfinished palace. The building remained deserted for a some time. In 1904, on occasion of the death of Queen Victoria, the British Resident asked the Nizam to set up an institute in her memory. The latter issued a royal firman to set up the Victoria Memorial Orphanage at the Saroornagar Palace. The orphanage opened officially on 14 February 1905. In 1953, the word \\"orphanage\\" was replaced by \\"home\\" due to a request by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. In 2017, the government announced a plan to hand over a part of the orphanage to house the Rachakonda Police Comissionerate. This resulted in widespread controversy and a case was filed in the High Court against the government. Several activists including Mir Najaf Ali Khan protested against the shift.  Building  The building is rectangular in shape, with a length of 420 feet and breadth of 285 feet. It has two floors. It is surrounded by thick greenery. It has an arched entrance, and high-ceilinged large rooms.

Stove in manse The chapel and manse were documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1952, which produced measured drawings and photos of both. In 1970, both buildings were intact and unaltered; the manse needed a coat of paint and the church needed minor repairs inside. The pair was listed on the NRHP in 1972. The Santee Normal Training School operated from 1870 to 1936. Albert Riggs was principal and had two assistants. By 1885 there were 18 buildings on the school's .

Terrain The Leatherwood Wilderness Area contains some of the most broken terrain within the Ozarks. In several locations sheer cliffs of rise about creek drainage areas. Backpacking and camping are allowed in the entire wilderness area, but no pre-made trails exist and, because of the brokenness of the terrain, caution is advised. Hikers will occasionally run onto old roads, farms, and cabins from before the area was designated as a wilderness area that are returning to nature. Many caves exist within the wilderness area, but all of them are closed to human entrance to prevent the spread of white nose syndrome among bat populations.

The mandapa (rock sanctuary) is part of the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram. It is the largest cave temple in Mahabalipuram. It is an example of Indian rock-cut architecture dating from the late 7th century. The temple is one of the finest testimonial to the ancient Vishwakarma Sthapathis, of rock-cut cave architecture, out of many such caves also called mandapas. Part of the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram, the temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as inscribed in 1984 under criteria i, ii, iii and iv. Geography The Panchapandava Mandapa or Pancha Pandava Cave Temple, is near the open-air bas-relief of Arjuna‚Äôs Penance, in Mahablaipuram town. It is situated on the top of a hill range along with other caves in Mahabalipuram, on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal of the Indian Ocean. Now in the Kanchipuram district, it is approximately from Chennai city (previously, Madras) and about from Chengelpet. History General view of the entrance to the Panchapandava Cave Temple, 1885 The columns of the verandah, which have lion bases are a typical style of Pallava architecture. From the architectural features carved in the cave it is conjectured that this style could be assigned to Narasimhavarman I (Mamalla period) to Narasimhavarman II (Rajasimha) during the mid-7th century. Layout Another view of the Pancha Pandava Cave Temple The cave temple is unfinished. The entrance is east facing. The temple has the longest cavern, long, among Mahabalipuram Cave Temples. The length of the opening is indicative of creating a circumambulatory passage within the cave to go round the main shrine. Architecture The entrance to the cave has columns resting on seated lions, which is a typical Pallava style of rock-cut architecture. There are six lion based pillars on the front fa√ßade of the cave, apart from two pilasters at both ends abutting the rock. As compared to other caves there is an improvement in the layout and the architectural elements that have been carved in the cave. One is the circumambulatory passage around regular structural temples in South India and the other feature is provision of brackets with lion caryatids over the pillars forming the facade; each caryatid consists of three lions one facing to the front and the other two facing to the sides without a lion on the backside. The brackets above the capitals of the pillars have decorations of griffins with human riders also, in addition to the lions. The pillars and pilasters with Yyala base of the pillars and Pilasters are cut out over a square pitha bass plate. Within the cave, there is long chamber with a second row of four pillars and two pilasters. To the back of this second veranda there is small chamber cut in an octagonal shape flanked by two niches; it is inferred from this that the intended purpose was to carve this chamber to a square plan and making a passage behind it for circumambulation. Only a small chamber has been carved at the centre, which has remained attached to the main rock. At the entrance, the curved cornice has a series of shrines with the four central shrines projecting out. The vaulted roofs of the shrines are carved with kudu horseshoe-arch dormer-like projections and each shrine houses another smaller shrine. The niche below the kudu has a carved deity. Ferocious looking lions are also carved.

The station is served daily from about 300 services of the Munich S-Bahn each day and is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station. It has two platforms tracks and lies on the Munich‚ÄìRosenheim railway and the Munich‚ÄìM√ºhldorf railway. History No station was opened at Berg am Laim when the Munich‚ÄìRosenheim railway opened on 15 October 1871. Berg am Laim was only opened as a halt () on 1 in May 1897, but only on the line to Rosenheim, which then ran parallel but south of the line to M√ºhldorf at this point. The station was, however, closed on 1 May 1915 because the line to Rosenheim was moved to the north so that it was next to the line to M√ºhldorf, but no new station was opened. A year later, on 1 May 1916, another Berg am Laim halt opened, this time only on the line to M√ºhldorf. On 1 October 1938, the station's name was changed from Berg am Laim to M√ºnchen-Berg am Laim. Until the introduction of the S-Bahn on Munich 28 May 1972, the station served only by trains on the M√ºhldorf line, but since the introduction of the S-Bahn it has been served by both lines. The platforms were made accessible for the disabled in 2008 with the provision of a separate underpass for the S-Bahn; previously travellers had to use the adjacent road tunnel to reach the platform. Infrastructure The station has two platform tracks on an island platform, which has been equipped for disabled people since 2008. The platform is accessible via a pedestrian underpass and it has a platform canopy and digital platform displays.

Workshops include bookbinding, graphic and web design, letterpress printing, and self-publishing, as of 2010. The center's Youth Sunday program was created in 1998. As of 2015, the program occurs each Sunday, \\"when employees on-site assist youths in creating their own print media. The program aims to help novices understand the fine points of the growing field of independent publishing.\\" The center hosted an annual print show and sale, as of 2019. History IPRC was established in 1998. The organization operated on Portland's west side for its first fifteen years, above the Reading Frenzy at 921 Southwest Oak Street, near Powell's Books. The center relocated to a larger space at 1001 Southeast Division Street in 2012. IPRC had approximately 6,000 members, as of mid 2016. IPRC faced a 300 percent rent increase when the April 2017 lease expired, causing the center to relocate to its current location. The organization crowdsourced more than $20,000 to help fund the new space. =Leadership= Portland City Commissioner Chloe Eudaly served as the director of the IPRC before running for office in 2016. Former board president Brian Tibbetts was serving as interim executive director following A.M. O'Malley's departure, as of August 2017. Hajara Quinn served as program director at the time. Nicole Georges worked for IPRC for fourteen years, initially as an outreach coordinator and later as the center's first comic book instructor. IPRC has organized the Letterpress Print Fair; in 2019, the center hosted an Open House as part of Design Week Portland.

It is native to Australia and New Zealand. Distribution and habitat The plant occurs at sheltered sites in subalpine and subantarctic regions, in grasslands and around bogs, up to 2000 m above sea level. Description Huperzia australiana has decumbent stems with densely tufted, erect branches up to 300 mm long, usually branched 2 or 3 times. The leaves are crowded, appressed to spreading, 5‚Äì9 mm long, 0.5‚Äì1.5 mm wide in the middle and tapering to a point. It reproduces vegetatively through the often numerous small bulbils which form along the stem. The sporophylls are similar to the foliage leaves; no strobili are formed; the bright yellow, kidney-shaped sporangia are produced in the upper leaf axils.

The film describes how the romantic views of war as pictured in the Soviet war film industry were actually far different from the harsh realities of front line warfare. Plot Major Lopatin (played by actor Yuri Nikulin) is a military journalist during World War II, who goes back to his hometown of Tashkent (Uzbekistan) in Middle Asia at the end of 1942 to spend a 20-day leave following the Battle of Stalingrad and to see the shooting of a film based on his wartime articles he has written. There he is romantically involved with a woman named Nina (played by Ludmila Gurchenko). Lopatin realizes that the romanticized views of warfare on the home front are vastly different from the realities he had encountered. Production The film was based on the novel and screenplay of Konstantin Simonov (1915-1979), a military journalist who wrote the famous poem \\"Wait for me\\" during World War II in 1941. The film was mostly shot in black and white, or very muted color, as looking aged to be visually closed to that wartime.

The town serves as a holiday destination with a focus on recreational fishing. A boat ramp is available in the neighboring town of Corinella. Coronet Bay is serviced by a General Store, and has a community centre and hall, located on the Fred Gration Reserve. History Just to the east of the present town, a settlement was founded in 1826 from Sydney, in response to a concern for possible French territorial claims. In that year Dumont d'Urville, in command of the corvette Astrolabe, examined Westernport, arousing suspicion during his scientific voyage. Authorities in Sydney had also recently received reports from explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell, who mistakenly believed they had reached Westernport in 1824, when in fact they had arrived at Corio Bay many kilometres to the west. A contingent of soldiers and 21 convicts under the command of Captain Wright was dispatched with William Hovell to assist. Initially, a small military settlement called Fort Dumaresq was established near the present-day site of Rhyll, on the north coast of Phillip Island. But lack of fresh water proved a problem and the outpost was moved to Corinella, at that time called Settlement Point. Hovell's subsequent report claiming Westernport was unsuitable for agriculture, owing to poor soil and lack of fresh water, and also the absence of any Frenchmen, led to the abandonment of the settlements in 1828. The buildings were burnt to prevent use by escaped convicts. A memorial cairn in Jamieson Street Corinella marks the site of the original settlement, and another monument at the end of Smythe Street commemorates Paul Edmund de Strzelecki's exploration in 1840. The 1826-8 Corinella was subject to extensive archaeological investigations in the late 1970s by the Victoria Archaeological Survey, led by Peter Coutts. Although equivocal in its conclusions about the location and remains of the settlement, the dig established the importance of the site to Victoria's history and European settlement.

It belongs to the transferase family.  Classification  This enzyme belongs to a family of enzymes that transfer aldehyde or ketonic groups. To be specific, this enzyme belongs to the transketolase and transaldolase families. Common names for the enzyme are: * MenD * SEPHCHC synthase * 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic-acid synthase * Systematic name: isochorismate:2-oxoglutarate 4-oxopentanoatetransferase  Reaction  In the biosynthesis of vitamin K, SEPHCHC is involved in the second step of the pathway. The type of reaction is decarboxylating, and to have maximum activity, this enzymes uses the cofactor Mg2+, a magnesium ion. In previous years, it was thought that this reaction led to SHCHC, the product MenH. After further research, we now know that this reaction is a new step in the pathway. The actual product of this enzyme can lose a pyruvate spontaneously. Step 2 in the biosynthesis of menaquinone  Structure  The structures reveal a stable dimer-of-dimers association in agreement with gel filtration and analytical studies confirm the classification of MenD in the pyruvate oxidase family.

Its apparent magnitude is 7.205. The star's light is somewhat blueshifted as it is moving toward rather than away from us and it has been known to astronomers for over a century as a high- velocity star based on its other vectors (proper motion). An early spectroscopic analysis by Joseph W. Chamberlain and Lawrence Aller revealed it to have a substantially lower metal content than the Sun. Modern spectroscopic analyses find an iron content about a factor of 250 lower than that of the Sun. It is one of the closest metal-poor (Population II) stars to Earth. The star was already known by 1912 when W. S. Adams measured its astrometry using a spectrograph in the Mount Wilson Observatory. Age and significance Because HD 140283 is neither on the main sequence nor a red giant, its early position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram has been interpreted with its data and theoretical models of stellar evolution based on quantum mechanics and the observations of processes in millions of stars to infer its apparent old age. For field stars (as opposed to stars in clusters), it is rare to know a star's luminosity, surface temperature, and composition precisely enough to get a well-constrained value for their age. Because of their relative scarcity, this is even rarer for a Population II star such as HD 140283\\\\. A study published in 2013 used the Fine Guidance Sensors of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to measure a precise parallax (and therefore distance and luminosity) for the star. This information was used to estimate an age for the star of 14.46 ¬± 0.8 billion years. Due to the uncertainty in the value, this age for the star may or may not conflict with the calculated age of the Universe as determined by the final 2015 Planck satellite results of 13.799 ¬± 0.021 billion years. Once dubbed the \\"Methuselah Star\\" by the popular press due to its age, if the assumptions of stellar evolution are correct in the report, the star must have formed soon after the Big Bang and is one of the oldest stars known. The search for such very iron-poor stars has shown they are almost all anomalies in globular clusters and the Galactic Halo. This accords with a narrative that they are rare survivors of their generation. If so, the apparent visual data of the oldest of these enables us to longstop-date the reionization (first star formation) phase of the Universe independently of theories and evidence of the first few million years after the Big Bang. Most stars from Population II and Population III are no longer observable. Theories exist allowing for an older age of the universe than conventionally accepted, which can still accommodate the observed redshift of early objects and earlier radiation. Some depart from the conventional big-bang/inflation model, such as the steady- state and cyclic models. To date no accurate, greater-age evidence from a cosmic object has been found that calls into question the Planck satellite results. Studies of the star also help astronomers understand the Universe's early history. Very low but non-zero metallicities of stars like HD 140283 indicate the star was born in the second generation of stellar creation; their heavy-element content is believed to have come from zero-metal stars (Population III stars), which have never been observed. Those first stars are thought to have been born a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, and they died in explosions (supernovae) after only a few million years. A second generation of stars, the generation in which HD 140283 is theorized to have been born, could not have coalesced until gas, heated from the supernova explosions of the earlier stars, cooled down. This hypothesis of such stars' birth and our best models of the early universe indicate that the time it took for the gases to cool was likely only a few tens of millions of years. The proportions of elements in such metal-poor stars is modelled to tell us much of the earlier nucleosynthetic (\\"metals\\") yield, that is of elements other than hydrogen and helium from the supernovae of the locally-extinct Population III stars. Some of the latter may be visible in gravitational lensing in looking at deepest images such as the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (i.e., their brief existence before their turning into supernovae). As with , CS22892-0052, and , HD 140283 has an excess of oxygen and the alpha elements relative to iron. While the proportions of these elements is much lower in HD 140283 than in the Sun, they are not as low as is the case for iron. The implication is that the first population of stars generated the alpha elements preferentially to other groups of elements, including the iron peak and s-process. Unlike those other metal-poor stars, HD 140283 has a detectable amount of lithium, a consequence of HD 140283 having not yet evolved into a red giant and thereby not yet having undergone the first dredge-up.

History Max Aronoff founded the New School of Music in Philadelphia in 1943 with the initial support of Catherine Drinker Bowen and Barbara Rex.An Address Delivered by Catherine Drinker Bowen of the Occasion of the 25th Anniversary of the New School of Music, 1968 Aronoff together with founding members of the Curtis String Quartet, Jascha Brodsky and Orlando Cole and with support from pianist Vladimir Sokoloff who were all on the faculty at the prestigious Curtis Institute decided on a curriculum that focused on training chamber artists and orchestral members, rather than soloists. Like Curtis, New School's enrollment was only open to orchestral instrumentalists and pianists. The faculty consisted of the four members of the Curtis String Quartet, select members of the Philadelphia Orchestra and two piano teachers (Gisa Adler and Jeanne Behrend). Housed first at the Orpheus Club on Van Pelt Street, Philadelphia, the school moved later to a building at 18th and Pine with the financial backing of Henry Gerstley, Frank Adler, Alice Tully and Samuel Simeon Fels. In March 1968 the school moved again to a historic, brownstone mansion at 301 S. 21st Street in Philadelphia. The mansion was converted into a high-functioning conservatory, complete with practice rooms, offices, library and auditorium. New School originated as an all string school. In 1969, they opened admission to winds, brass and percussion, offering scholarships and opportunities to study with Philadelphia Orchestra musicians. The school received accreditation in 1970 and awarded their first Bachelor of Music degrees in 1974. Prior to 1974, students graduated with a performance diploma. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the school was thriving and had a reputation of graduating top-tier musicians.

In 1985, Temple University alumna, Esther Boyer Griswold, designated the single largest gift in the university's history to date, for a music endowment. The gift served as the impetus for the renaming of the College to: The Esther Boyer College of Music at Temple University. This gift made it possible for Temple Univ to purchase the insolvent New School of Music. The faculty, programs, and library, all merged into the Boyer School of Music program. The New School of Music facility on 21st Street and Spruce was sold for $600,000. Those funds were used to renovate the concert hall at Temple. In 1986, the board named Richard C. Brodhead acting president. A Philadelphia native and composer, he had been dean of the school from 1982. As Acting President, he played a principal role in formulating the merger of the New School with Temple University's Boyer College of Music and Dance. From 1986 to 1987, the Boyer College of Music's instrumental performance program was significantly enhanced by the merger of The New School of Music . Guided since its founding by members of the Curtis String Quartet, this merger has broadened the opportunities for private instrumental study and for training in the performance of chamber ensemble and orchestral literature.

In his career, Bamberger also worked with the New York City Opera, New York Philharmonic, and Opera Orchestras of Cologne, Hamburg & Stuttgart. Max Aronoff Max Aronoff was violist of the Curtis String Quartet and teacher at the esteemed Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He was the first student admitted to Curtis when the school opened and was in its first graduating class in 1934. While a student, Max Aronoff studied with Carl Flesch and Louis Bailly, both legendary teachers in their time. Upon graduation, Aronoff joined the Curtis faculty, a position he held until his death, in 1981. In 1943, Max Aronoff founded the New School of Music. Under his direction, the New School of Music developed an exceptional reputation as a conservatory, specializing in training orchestral musicians. During the fifty-two year performing career of the Curtis String Quartet, Aronoff and his colleagues toured the United States and Europe. They performed for such prestigious audiences as the White House and the Queen of England, as well as on many educational and cultural series in and around Philadelphia. They never stayed away from their teaching posts at Curtis and New School for long, and their dedication to training young musicians was respected throughout the musical world. For several generations, students of Max Aronoff have been among the most accomplished violists in professional orchestras, chamber ensembles, and teaching positions at conservatories and universities throughout the United States. The Max Aronoff Viola Institute (\\"MAVI\\") was founded to honor the memory of this musical genius and to continue his teaching legacy. Jascha Brodsky \\"Jascha Brodsky was a violinist who performed as a member of the Curtis String Quartet for more than 50 years and was a world-renowned violin teacher. Brodsky was born in Kharkov, Ukraine, in 1907 and was the son of a violinist, who gave him his first lessons. He studied at the Conservatory of Tbilisi in Georgia and performed in orchestras in the Soviet Union until 1926, when he left the country to study in Paris with Lucien Capet and Eugene Ysaye. In the late 1920s, he toured Europe and the Soviet Union as a soloist and performed the Prokofiev Violin Concerto No. 1 with the composer conducting. On the advice of the violinist Mischa Elman, Brodsky applied to the newly founded Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and in 1930 he enrolled there as a student of Efrem Zimbalist. That year he became first violinist of the ensemble that eventually became the Curtis String Quartet. He continued to perform with the ensemble until 1981, when it disbanded after the death of its founding violist, Max Aronoff. Brodsky joined the faculty of Curtis in 1932, and continued to teach the violin and chamber music there until his retirement in 1996. He also had a long teaching relationship with the Esther Boyer College of Music at Temple University, of which he was a founding faculty member in 1942, when it was known as the New School. In 2019, violinist Lara St. John alleged that she was molested and raped by Jascha Brodsky in his office at the New School in the mid-1980s when she was 14 years old. Another student came forward anonymously at the same time alleging that Brodsky had made sexual advances toward her when she was 20 and studying with him at the New School. =Brass faculty= Donald E.

The author ‚Äì not the supporter of conceptual and abstract music. His compositions are inverted, first of all to soul of the student and only then ‚Äì to reason.

He began his second term on January 11, 2016. A native of Shreveport, Peacock is a businessman and former elected member of the Louisiana State Republican Central Committee. Education and career Peacock was born in Shreveport to John William \\"Bill\\" Peacock (1931-2012) and the former Sidney Barrow. John Peacock graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, served in the United States Air Force in England, and was the president until his retirement in 1998 of Peacock Surgical and Company in Shreveport. Barrow Peacock's paternal grandparents were William Arnold Peacock and the former Mattie Williams. Peacock has a sister, Martha Peacock Ross and her husband, Lew. Peacock earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Southern Methodist University. He also holds a Master of Business Administration degree from LSU in Baton Rouge. Peacock is a partner at BHP Properties, a Shreveport investments and real estate firm. He has also served on the Board of Directors at the Christus Schumpert Health System Foundation and the Louisiana Association for the Blind. He was the finance chairman at the Biomedical Research Foundation of Northwest Louisiana. He is a notary public in Louisiana and holds a license in real estate. Early political career Before he was elected to the state senate, Peacock ran four unsuccessful campaigns for both houses of the Louisiana State Legislature. He persisted, gaining more popular vote each time that he ran. Louisiana State Senate On May 24, 2011 Peacock announced his second campaign for the District 37 senate seat. The incumbent B. L. Shaw, a retired educator from Shreveport elected in 2007, decided not to seek a second term. A term-limited state representative, Jane H. Smith, another retired educator, was Peacock's principal primary challenger in the heavily Republican district. Smith received the endorsement of Governor Bobby Jindal, who himself was reelected in the 2011 primary. The 37th district comprises sections of Shreveport and Bossier City. At the outset of the election, Peacock described his reasons for running as such: > For too long Louisiana has taxed too much and spent too much. Louisiana > hasn't grown, the government has... Peacock went on to win the election against Smith with 55 percent of the vote. Shaw described Peacock's win as a \\"David-versus-Goliath victory\\" because Smith had carried Jindal's backing. As a newly elected senator, Peacock voted against then Governor Jindal's choice for Senate President, John Alario of Westwego in Jefferson Parish. Peacock's rationale for opposing Alario is that he had promised constituents that he would not vote to confirm Alario. Previously, Alario was twice Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives under the Edwin Edwards administration. Alario assigned Peacock to the Retirement and Labor committees. After his first session, Peacock achieved a 100 percent Outstanding Family Advocate Award from the Louisiana Family Forum, a 100 percent scorecard from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, a 100 percent rating from the Federation of Independent Business in Louisiana and an A+ from the Louisiana Sheriff's Association. In January 2016, Senate President John Alario appointed Peacock, his former intraparty rival, as chairman of the Senate Retirement Committee. Conservative radio talk show host Moon Griffon of Lafayette has frequently ridiculed Peacock on Griffon's program because of Peacock's since close ties to Alario. Griffon mimics a bird to show what he considers Peacock's subservience to Alario. Moreover, Griffon is critical of all of the Republican state senators for what he considers their lack of legislative independence and willingness to approve higher taxes.The Moon Griffon Show, February 13, 2017. However, Griffon noted thereafter that Peacock was one of only two state senators to oppose a budget change in 2017 requested by Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards and backed by Alario.

In practice, it usually contains highly inflated prices at several times that of actual costs to the hospital. The chargemaster typically serves as the starting point for negotiations with patients and health insurance providers of what amount of money will actually be paid to the hospital. It is described as \\"the central mechanism of the revenue cycle\\" of a hospital. Description The chargemaster may be alternatively referred to as the \\"charge master\\", \\"hospital chargemaster\\", or the \\"charge description master\\" (CDM). It is a comprehensive listing of items billable to a hospital patient or a patient's health insurance provider. It is described as \\"the central mechanism of the revenue cycle\\" of a hospital. Chargemasters include thousands of hospital services, medical procedures, equipment fees, drugs, supplies, and diagnostic evaluations such as imaging and blood tests. Each item in the chargemaster is assigned a unique identifier code and a set price that are used to generate patient bills. Every hospital system maintains its own chargemaster. Usually, hospitals regard their chargemaster, alongside the medical codes that catalogue the billing items, as a trade secret that is central to their business, and state laws and courts have often accepted the view that these are proprietary information. The procedure of developing, maintaining, and monitoring the chargemaster and its pricing scheme often necessitates multiple hospital employees working under the supervision of a \\"chargemaster coordinator\\", a \\"charge master manager\\", or others in the health care system's operations or administrative support areas frequently called a \\"charge master team\\". Ultimate responsibility for ensuring accuracy of the chargemaster rests with each hospital's chief financial officer, compliance officer, and hospital Board. Approximately forty percent of hospitals pay outside companies to help create and then adapt their chargemasters on a yearly basis. According to Essentials of Managed Health Care, as of 2012 the chargemaster file typically included between 20,000 and 50,000 price definitions. The Lewin Group analyzed utilization of the chargemaster and found that a low proportion of hospitals carried out regular reviews of their chargemaster implementation. Costs for patients maintained on the chargemaster differ greatly from hospital to hospital. Authors J. Patrick Rooney and Dan Perrin note in their book America's Health Care Crisis Solved, \\"Charge-master rates, in reality, serve as nothing more than the starting point for negotiations\\" with the payer. The impact of the chargemaster is such that those with good insurance or better access to means to afford quality healthcare pay the least for that care, whereas conversely uninsured, and others who pay out-of-pocket for healthcare pay the full chargemaster listed price for the same services. Existing legislation and regulations In California, a regulation known as the \\"Payers' Bill of Rights\\" (which is unique to the state) requires all hospitals to provide their chargemaster to the state, which then posts them online for the public. The chargemaster procedure is generally only regulated in Maryland; author Peter Reid Kongstvedt notes in Essentials of Managed Care, \\"Of particular importance, other than in Maryland, hospitals are generally free to charge whatever they want in their chargemaster.\\" Critical analysis Chargemasters gained national attention in early 2013, when in short succession, there were two important publications made. First, there was a Time magazine cover story published February 20, 2013, titled \\"Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us\\", in which reporter Steven Brill examined the overlooked role that chargemasters played in the American health care system's cost crisis, asserting that they routinely listed extremely high prices \\"devoid of any calculation related to cost\\", and were generally regarded as \\"fiction\\" in the healthcare industry, despite their significant role in setting prices for both insured and uninsured patients alike. Then, a couple months later, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published inpatient prices for hospitals across the country in a publicly available format. \\"The 'full charges' reflected on hospital Charge Masters are unconscionable\\", wrote George A. Nation III in a 2005 piece for the Kentucky Law Journal. Health care economist scholar Uwe Reinhardt noted in a 2006 article for Health Affairs that the approach to chargemasters by hospitals would have to be modified to become more transparent, in order to encourage a form of consumer-driven health care to help improve the system. University of California, Berkeley professor of health economics James C. Robinson pointed out prior criticism of the chargemaster, \\"Much ink has been spilt bemoaning that incomprehensible foundation of hospital cost accounting and prices, the redoubtable chargemaster.\\" Robinson called for greater transparency as well as increased price standardization as steps to help remedy the situation. In a 2007 article for Health Affairs, Gerard F. Anderson observed, \\"Without knowing what services they will use in advance, it is impossible for patients to comparison shop.\\" Anderson also noted the esoteric nature of the language on the chargemaster made it difficult for patients and anyone other than hospital administrators to understand. Anderson emphasized the difficulty of patients' ability to interpret the chargemaster in a subsequent 2012 article: \\"Furthermore, most of the items on the charge master file are written in code so that only the hospital administrators and a few experts in the field can interpret their meanings.\\" See also *Charity care *Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care *Explanation of benefits (insurance) *Healthcare Blue Book *Health care prices *Health insurance in the United States *Health insurance costs in the United States *J.

Mayer, W. C. Peacock, P. K. Wrigley, Sewell Avery, and other prominent Chicagoans. At the clubhouse's dedication, John Philip Sousa directed his band. The club was located in Chicago's Lincoln Park, near Diversey Harbor. The club was built and primarily operated for skeet shooting and trap shooting, with occasional waterfowl hunting. Its address was 2901 N. Lake Shore Drive. In February 1991, then Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris sued the club for allegedly polluting the lake with lead shot. The lakefront had previously been dredged in 1947 to remove and gather the accumulated lead, with disputes taking place over who would benefit from its sale (500 tons of lead were recovered and lead was then selling for $300 a ton). The Chicago Park District, who owned the land where the gun club operated, immediately shut down the club until it could prove its activities were safe and also insisted it pay to have the lakefront dredged. Members charged that the shutdown was not due to pollution, but because of anti-gun bias. The gun club filed suit against the park district; however their suit was dismissed. The following summer, most of the club's buildings were demolished by the park district. In 1995, Park District Superintendent Forrest Claypool planned to reorganize the parks as quasi-private affairs, with private companies providing services on the property. That year, the gun club's former clubhouse reopened as a community center. The city had paid $500,000 two years prior for an analysis of the soil and sand where the club had operated; however the study, performed by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, determined that there was no pollution present, and that although there was a significant amount of lead shot and clay pigeons resting on the lake's bottom, it posed no health risk to humans or aquatic life.

The quartet as an entity was formed in 1932Daniel John Carroll, \\"Brodsky, Jascha\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). with initial members Jascha Brodsky, Benjamin Sharlip (violins), Max Aronoff (viola), and Orlando Cole (cello). After Sharlip's departure in 1934 to join the Philadelphia Orchestra, the position was filled by Charles Jaffe; it was with him that they achieved many of their earliest milestones. The ensemble's origins are actually a bit earlier: they were initially called the Swastika Quartet upon their founding as students in 1927, with Gama Gilbert and Benjamin Sharlip as violinists, Sheppard Lehnhoff as violist, and Orlando Cole as cellist. In 1929, Max Aronoff replaced Lehnhoff as violist. This early incarnation of the group took its name from the home of the Curtis founder, Mary Louise Curtis Bok in Merion, Pennsylvania, which was called \\"Swastika\\". After Adolf Hitler assumed power in Germany and adopted this symbol, albeit rotated, the ensemble decided the name needed to be changed. They petitioned Mary Louise Curtis, founder and namesake of their alma mater, to use that name as they were all graduates of the Curtis Institute of Music, and became the first American-trained quartet to visit Europe, when the British Broadcasting Corporation invited them to London in 1935.Otto E. Albrecht, Tom Di Nardo, Eve R. Meyer, and Nina Davis-Millis, \\"Philadelphia\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). This visit, made in June 1935 and sponsored by the Philadelphia branch of the English-Speaking Union, was in connection with the celebration of the Jubilee of George V and was in the company of several other young Philadelphia musicians: Rose Bampton, pianists Elizabeth Westmoreland and Martha Halbwachs Mass√©na, singers Agnes Davis and Benjamin de Loache, and violinist Philip Frank. Two concerts and a BBC broadcast presented music by American composers. The Curtis Quartet's contributions included Gian Carlo Menotti's Italian Dance and two works by Samuel Barber: the Serenade for String Quartet, Op. 1 (1928), and Dover Beach, Op. 3 (1931).Barbara B. Heyman, Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992): 123. . Shortly before this tour, on 13 May 1935, the Curtis Quartet had made a recording at the RCA studios in Camden, New Jersey, of Barber's Dover Beach, with the composer singing. Although Rose Bampton had made an earlier recording in 1933, it was never released, so the Curtis Quartet's recording became the first commercial release in June 1936.Barbara B. Heyman, Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992): 107. . The quartet was subsequently engaged for an extensive European tour during the 1936-37 concert season, during which they performed in all the major musical capitals to great acclaim. They reprised this success during the 1937-38 season and were set to repeat it a third time before the outbreak of war in Europe curtailed their touring. In the meantime, they toured widely through North America, giving over the course of their career approximately 5000 concerts, in their early days giving in many cases the first quartet performances in the towns they visited. In 1942 they left Curtis briefly, owing to disagreements over the direction of the institution, and founded the New School of Music, Philadelphia to train chamber and orchestral players; they became the resident string quartet there.Allan Kozinn, \\"Jascha Brodsky, 90, Violinist at Curtis Institute\\" (obituary), New York Times (March 6, 1997): D22. Violinist Charles Jaffe resigned from the quartet during the war years (joining the Philadelphia Orchestra and later the NBC Symphony under Toscanini before becoming an acclaimed Tony Award-winning Broadway music director) and was succeeded by Louis Berman, with whom the ensemble undertook its recording career in earnest. A disc of the Haydn 'Quinten' quartet and other works was made for RCA in 1942 but never released due to the war. Subsequently, with Berman, they made recordings of works by Brahms, Dohnanyi, Dvorak, Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Smetana as well as piano quintets of Dohnanyi and Franck with their longtime colleague and classmate, Vladimir \\"Billy\\" Sokoloff. Louis Berman was succeeded as second violinist first by Enrique Serratos, in the mid-1950s. Conductor Zubin Mehta's family moved to the United States when his father Mehli Mehta joined the quartet as second violinist in 1959. In the late 1960s, the second violinist was Geoffrey Michaels. He was finally replaced by Yumi Ninomiya, now a member of the Philadelphia Orchestra. After about 5000 performances, the quartet disbanded in 1981 upon the death of violist Max Aronoff.Anon., \\"Curtis String Quartet\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).

Owings (December 7, 1943 ‚Äì April 9, 2011) was a professor of psychology and faculty member of the Animal Behavior Graduate Group at the University of California, Davis. His research focused on ground squirrels, in particular, their interactions with predators such as rattlesnakes; and, more generally, on concepts of communication within and between species. In 1994, he was elected as a fellow of the animal behavior society and in 2010 he received the Exemplar Award for mentoring graduate students. Biography=Intellectual= He was born in Atlanta, Georgia in the United States. He graduated from Bellaire High School in Houston, Texas. In 1965, he earned a B.A. degree from the University of Texas at Austin followed by a Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Washington in 1972. In 1971, he became a faculty member University of California, Davis department of psychology. In 1994, his research in the field of animal behavior resulted in his election as a fellow of the Animal Behavior Society and in 2010, he received the Exemplar Award for mentor graduate students from the Animal Behavior Society. In connection with this award, one of his former graduate students wrote: > It was so wonderful working with you - I really could not have asked for a > better advisor. I learned so much from you and am grateful for how you > broadened my understanding of animal behavior and let me be part of a truly > fascinating research system and great research team. =Personal= His parents were Markely J. Owings and Erin White Owings. He was married to Sharon Calhoun Owings and had a son, Ragon and daughter, Anna. He died at his home after battling prostate cancer for over 24 years. Research=Ground squirrels and snakes= His primary animal system for investigating animal behavior, social behavior and communication, and antipredator and counter-antipredator behavior was California ground squirrels and snakes (especially rattlesnakes). Adult California ground squirrels must defend against avian and mammalian predators. They also must defend their pups especially from predation by rattlesnakes and gopher snakes. Owings together with his students and colleagues discovered a number of behavioral and physiological defense mechanisms against snakes. When ground squirrels encounter a predator, their first response is to typically vocalize in distinctly different ways to aerial and ground predators. Encounters with snakes may elicit ground predator vocalization, but ground squirrels then shift to visual signaling by tail flagging. Tail flagging has the advantage of harassing snakes and deterring them from entering burrows with squirrel pups, but it has the disadvantage of requiring close proximity to snakes increasing the likelihood of snake bites. In response to this problem, ground squirrels have evolved the capacity to neutralize rattlesnake venom. Rattlesnakes have evolved specialized sensory organs (infrared-sensitive pit organs) that enhance their ability to predate small mammals. This ability to sense in the infrared set the stage for ground squirrels to evolve antipredator counter- innovations that take advantage of the specialized sensory organs of rattlesnakes. Owings and colleagues found that ground squirrels shunt blood to their tails when encountering rattlesnakes. This allows ground squirrels to tail flag to rattlesnakes even in the dark with their hot tails that rattlesnakes can detect with infrared-sensitive pit organs. Ground squirrels do not shunt blood to their tails when they encounter gopher snakes, which also feed on their young, but lack infrared-sensitive pit organs. =Assessment/management communication= His research on predator-prey interactions between ground squirrels and rattlesnakes led to the formulation of a new theoretical perspective on communication called assessment/management view of communication. From this perspective, communication is dependent on the sensory and action systems of the individuals engaged in communication. Information is not sent or received by individuals but rather it is extracted from what others are doing and their context (i.e., Gibsonian affordances). The extracted information is then assessed and acted upon. What affordances an individual extracts and assesses depend on its sensory systems and, more generally, on the nature of its umwelt (i.e., an animal's sensory-actions systems). Because communication requires the extraction of information from affordances presented to individuals, this creates the opportunity to manipulate or manage the behavior of others by controlling the affordances they perceive. For example, ground squirrels have evolved the ability to shunt blood to their tails, which heats their tails up. They can then tail-flag at rattlesnakes, which can perceive their hot tails in the infrared. Communication is thus an inter-individual process of extracting and assessing information from affordances and actively managing the affordances perceived by others and thereby managing their behavior. In this view, communication is self-interested behavior, shaped by natural selection. The assessment/management view of communication is very general, allowing for both intra- and inter-species communication. It can also be extended to human communication to encompass a broader understanding of human communication during early development. The first form of human communication occurs via human infant crying. Human infants are helpless and their sensory-action systems are severely limited when compared to the sensory-action systems of their caregivers. They are very limited in assessing their own needs much less managing them. Caregivers can assess and manage the needs of infants, but they lack direct access to emotional needs of infants (e.g., hunger, pain). Human infant crying is highly salient and normally activates the assessment and management systems of caregivers directing them to crying infants. When successful, caregivers assess the needs of crying infants and act in ways that reduce these needs (e.g., feeding a hungry infant). The noxiousness of crying may be a factor some cases of child abuse. The assessment/management approach is predictive of malfunctions in infant-caregiver communication. For example, colic is common in technologically developed western countries, and may be the result of the decreased proximity between caregiver and infant. The decreased proximity can result in delayed responses by caregivers to crying infants resulting in infants escalating crying with the subsequent development long bouts crying that do not stop when a caregivers attempts to manage distressed infants. =Robosquirrel= The robosquirrel project stems directly from Owings' long-term research on the interactions of ground squirrels and rattlesnakes together with his assessment/management view of communication. Robosquirrel was developed to test implication of the assessment/management approach by developing robotic squirrels that could allow researchers to precisely control what affordances (e.g. tail wagging and tail heating) are presented to rattlesnakes for assessment and how these affordances can manage rattlesnake behavior.

During his time on the bench, he presided over many cases involving railroad and oil companies, and issued several historically-first injunctions and decisions. A supporter of women's suffrage, he appointed the first female bailiff in the history of the United States, and empaneled the first jury consisting entirely of women in the history of Kansas (second ever in the United States).  Early life  Aikman was born in 1858 in London, Kentucky. He attended the Laurel Seminary in his hometown. After his family moved to Kansas in 1871, Aikman began attending the schools of Butler County and eventually befriended William Allen White. Upon completing his education at age 18, Aikman obtained a teaching certificate and taught school for four years to help support his family and fund his further studies, reading law in the offices of Sluss & Hatten, in Wichita. He was admitted to the bar association of Kansas in 1881; the following year he began practicing law in El Dorado, Kansas, and joined the Freemasons, the Knights of Pythias, and the Modern Woodmen.  Judicial career Aikman was elected Probate Judge in 1883, and served four years (two terms) from 1884‚Äì1888. Upon leaving office, he returned to private practice, until 1900, when, as a Republican, he was elected a Judge of the 13th District Court of Kansas. During his time as a district court judge, Aikman presided over more than 100 cases involving railroad companies; in two cases, his decisions resulted in new state law. In the first instance, he issued a permanent injunction against the Santa Fe Railroad, preventing it from drilling for oil and gas on its right-of-way. In the second, he was the first judge to hold that railroad companies cannot escape their responsibility for damages by hiring private companies to burn overgrowth on their right-of-way. He also issued the first ever injunction in Kansas against railway and express companies delivering whiskey (during Prohibition). In 1905, Aikman presided over a notable antitrust case, Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State of Kansas v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company, in which the State of Kansas sought to revoke the charter of the railroad company, accusing them of conspiring with competing railroads to fix prices, working with Standard Oil to fix oil prices in Kansas, and cooperating with Chicago and Kansas City meat packers to regulate prices of meat and freight costs. Aikman was the first judge in Kansas to hold that the Old Soldiers Preference Law (a state law giving preferential hiring treatment to former soldiers in public jobs) was constitutional, with the Kansas State Supreme Court later affirming. In 1906, Aikman presided over the murder case of Lewis Bloomfield, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. In total, he presided over 12 murder trials, some of national notoriety, and was only reversed upon appeal once (his original decision was later sustained by the State Supreme Court). Aikman was frequently paid compliment by the Kansas Supreme Court for his competence and knowledge of the law. In 1907, Aikman presided over a case involving the kidnapping of the \\"St. Louis World's Fair Incubator Baby\\", which received national coverage. Aikman was a strong supporter of women's suffrage. He wrote and presented the first resolution endorsing women's suffrage in Kansas at a Republican State Convention, doing so against the recommendations of many leading Republicans who opposed the measure and claimed it would ruin him politically; he presented the measure anyway, a vote was called, and it ultimately carried. After suffrage was passed in Kansas, in 1912, with just over a month left in office, he appointed the United States' first-ever female bailiff, and empanelled the first-ever jury consisting entirely of women in Kansas history (second ever in United States history, after San Francisco), to sit on the case of H. H. Boeck vs. Carrie M. Schreiber. According to Aikman: > Women became qualified to act as jurors when the new constitutional > amendment made them electors. I desired the honor of presiding over the > first trial in which their new rights were executed.  Later life  Aikman left office after 1912 and returned to private practice with his brother, where he was recognized as a capable trial lawyer and jurist. He died on September 29, 1923. After his death, his widow published a book entitled Life and Character of Judge Granville P. Aikman, which consisted of many newspaper articles covering his life, political career and death, as well as tributes from his colleagues and friends, including Judges Allison Thompson Ayres, Volney P. Mooney, C. A. Leland, A. L. L. Hamilton and George J. Benson.

The largest remaining blocks of inland scrub are in and around the Ocala National Forest and in the Lake Wales Ridge National Wildlife Refuge. The Archbold Biological Station near Lake Placid contains about of scrub habitat and sponsors biological research on it. The scrub occurs on a series of north-south running ridges composed of sand derived from ancient dune fields. The soil, a type of entisol, is derived from quartz and is low in organic matter, silt, and clay. Because the low-nutrient sandy soils do not retain moisture, the ecosystem is effectively an arid one. The plants generally consist of xerophytic shrubs, especially oaks, with occasional pine trees. The understory is often sparse and sometimes absent, leaving only bare ground. Sand pine (Pinus clausa) is the typical pine. Oaks include Chapman oak (Quercus chapmanii), sand live oak (Quercus geminata), myrtle oak (Quercus myrtifolia), and the endemic Inopina oak (Quercus inopina). Other shrubs include rusty staggerbush (Lyonia ferruginea), saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), sandhill-rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides), scrub holly (Ilex opaca var. arenicola), scrub olive (Osmanthus megacarpa), scrub pawpaw (Asimina obovata), silk bay (Persea humilis), Adam's needle (Yucca filamentosa), and eastern prickly pear (Opuntia humifusa).

At Osma, to the northeast, Jacques Thomas Sarrut's French division fought an inconclusive skirmish with Kenneth Howard's division before withdrawing to the southeast. San Mill√°n de San Zadornil is located in the Province of Burgos while Osma is in √Ålava, Basque Country. The actions occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the wider Napoleonic Wars. In the summer of 1813, Wellington's army thrust into Spain from Portugal with a powerful army composed of British, Portuguese, and Spanish soldiers. The British general outmaneuvered his opponents and forced the French to abandon Salamanca, Valladolid, Madrid, and Burgos. King Joseph and Marshal Jean- Baptiste Jourdan believed their position behind the Ebro River was secure, but Wellington sent his troops marching to outflank the line on the north. As Sarrut moved north, his troops bumped into Howard's soldiers. Maucune's division at San Mill√°n was suddenly attacked from the west by Alten. Believing Maucune's division was no longer fit for combat, Joseph used it to escort a convoy and it missed the decisive Battle of Vitoria three days later. Background After the campaign in the fall of 1812, Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington's army was in poor shape, with 18,000 soldiers on the sick list. On the other hand, the campaign resulted in the capture of the cities of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Astorga, and Seville, and the provinces of Andalusia, Asturias, and Extremadura. Also, 5,000 new replacements came out from Great Britain.Gates (2002), p. 375 The winter of 1812 also witnessed the destruction of Emperor Napoleon's army during the French invasion of Russia. In order to rebuild his army in Germany, Napoleon demanded reinforcements of 15,000 men from King Joseph Bonaparte's army and 5,000 men from Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet's army in eastern Spain. To Joseph's relief, Marshal Jean-de- Dieu Soult was also recalled to join Napoleon and was replaced by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. The various withdrawals left Joseph in control of 95,000 troops in three armies. These were the 42,000-man Army of Portugal under Honor√© Charles Reille, the 36,000-strong Army of the South led by Honor√© Th√©odore Maxime Gazan de la Peyri√®re and the 17,000-man Army of the Center directed by Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon.Glover (2001), p. 226 Meanwhile, Joseph's forces reimposed control over northern and central Spain. However, guerrilla warfare in northern Spain soon spiralled out of control and Napoleon ordered Bertrand Clausel to replace Marie-Francois Auguste de Caffarelli du Falga as commander of the Army of the North.Gates (2002), p. 377 Obsessed with the Spanish partisans' disruption of communications with France, the emperor ordered the Army of Portugal's six divisions be made available to Clausel for anti-guerrilla operations.Glover (2001), pp. 226-227 With heavy reinforcements from the Army of Portugal, Clausel set about trying to suppress the Navarrese partisans. On 30 March 1813, the French general suffered a setback when guerrilla chief Francisco Espoz y Mina ambushed a French column. While two battalions were busily plundering Ler√≠n, Mina surprised them with 2,100 guerillas, including 200 lancers. Out of 1,500 French soldiers, only a handful escaped the disaster and 663 were made prisoner. Marie √âtienne de Barbot, commander of the 2nd Division of the Army of Portugal, was nearby with six battalions but failed to succor his ambushed column.Smith (1998), p. 412 On 12 May 1813, Clausel found and destroyed Mina's encampment in the Roncal Valley, inflicting 1,000 casualties on the guerillas. On the same day, Maximilien Sebastien Foy recaptured Castro Urdiales on the Bay of Biscay.Gates (2002), pp. 377-378 Foy commanded his own 1st Division and Jacques Thomas Sarrut's 4th Division, both of the Army of Portugal, and Giuseppe Federico Palombini's Italian Division from the Army of the Center. The Franco-Italians lost 150 killed and wounded out of 10,000 men and 18 siege guns. Colonel Pedro Alvarez's 1,000 Spanish soldiers suffered losses of 160 killed and wounded. Before being evacuated by the Royal Navy, Alvarez's men detonated the powder magazines and threw their cannons into the bay.Smith (1998), p. 419 While Clausel and Foy were employed hunting down guerillas, critical events were occurring elsewhere in Spain.Gates (2002), p. 378 Allied offensive Lord Wellington After the various subtractions of strength, Joseph had only 33,000 infantry, 9,000 cavalry, and 100 guns to face Wellington. Napoleon assured his brother Joseph that the British general was too cautious to take advantage of the situation, and in any case could only deploy 30,000 British and 20,000 Portuguese soldiers. In fact, Wellington was on the march with 52,000 British, 28,000 Portuguese, and 25,000 Spanish troops.Glover (2001), p. 227 The three- division right wing under Rowland Hill was ordered to advance northeast to Salamanca while the six-division left wing led by Thomas Graham crossed to the north bank of the Douro River inside Portugal.Fletcher (2005), p. 20 Joseph and Jourdan posted Gazan's Army of the South and d'Erlon's Army of the Center to cover Valladolid and Segovia, while Reille with the remaining 17,000 troops from the Army of Portugal was sent to the north to help suppress guerillas. At this time, Clausel's 20,000 soldiers were located near Pamplona, far to the east. Hill's wing seized Salamanca on 26 May 1813, chasing Eugene-Casimir Villatte's French troops out of the city and capturing 200 French soldiers. Meanwhile, Graham's soldiers forded the flooding Esla River at Almendra on 31 May, losing some men to drowning and much equipment.Fletcher (2005), pp. 21-22 Augustin Darricau, whose division held Zamora, had sent a cavalry reconnaissance to the west on 20 May that reported no enemy activity. The French horsemen just missed Graham, who crossed the Douro soon afterward. Finally alerted that 64,000 men were bearing down on Zamora from the northwest, Darricau bolted to the east, leaving Graham to occupy the town on the morning of 2 June.Gates (2002), 384 Joseph Bonaparte The same day, Colquhoun Grant's cavalry brigade consisting of the 10th, 15th, and 18th Hussar Regiments defeated a French cavalry force at Morales de Toro.Fletcher (2005), p. 23 The French mounted troops comprised the 16th and 21st Dragoon Regiments under Pierre Beno√Æt Soult and their horses were in very bad condition. The 16th was virtually destroyed, with two officers and 308 troopers being made prisoners; of these 100 were wounded. British casualties in the clash were only 16 killed and wounded.Smith (1998), p. 424 On 3 June, Hill's wing joined Graham on the north bank of the Douro at Toro. At this time, Wellington had 90,000 troops concentrated while the French could only count 51,000 men. Alarmed at the odds against them, Joseph and Jourdan sent a frantic message to Clausel asking for help and withdrew toward Burgos. Joseph and Jourdan expected Wellington to advance along the great road from Valladolid to Burgos. Instead, the British general directed Hill and the right wing to advance just to the north of the road. Graham and the left wing were farther to the north. To Graham's left marched a Spanish corps led by Pedro Agust√≠n Gir√≥n with 12,000 men.Glover (2001), p. 230 The French fell back behind the Pisuerga River and then to Burgos but, to their bewilderment only a handful of Spanish cavalry directly pursued them. Wellington's great flank march continued and the French abandoned Burgos on 13 June, blowing up the castle that had been the focus of the Siege of Burgos the previous autumn. Unsuspected by the French, the British commander was prepared to change his base from Lisbon to Santander on the Bay of Biscay. During the French retreat, Reille turned up with three divisions of the Army of Portugal, adding 15,000 men to Joseph's army. Clausel's 25,000 troops were at large but Joseph had no idea where they were. For his part, Clausel never received any messages from the king until 15 June, at which time he gathered four divisions and set out to join the main army.Glover (2001), p. 232 Joseph massed his army behind the Ebro River, believing that it would be impossible for Wellington's army to outflank the line on the north. On 15 June, Hill's wing crossed the Ebro at Puente Arenas and Graham's wing crossed at San Martin de Lines. From the 13th until a cavalry encounter on 17 June, the French lost all contact with their adversaries.Fletcher (2005), p. 24 Osma Joseph found out that Gir√≥n's column was menacing Bilbao so he directed Reille to move north with three divisions on 18 June. Reille soon ran afoul of Graham's wing of the Allied army. Graham had with him the 1st Division, 5th Division, George Anson's Light Dragoon Brigade, and Thomas Bradford's Independent Portuguese Brigade.Smith (1998), p. 426 On the 18th, Sarrut's 4th Division of the Army of Portugal blundered into Kenneth Howard's 1st Division at Osma. Sarrut's force included two battalions each of the 2nd Light, 4th Light, and 36th Line Infantry Regiments, about 3,800 men. The French encountered the 1st and 2nd Light King's German Legion (KGL) Battalions of Colin Halkett's brigade, about 1,200 troops. In the clash, the French suffered 120 killed and wounded while the KGL units lost between 50 and 60 casualties.Smith (1998), p. 425 Reille retreated south to link up with Joseph's army at Miranda de Ebro. Sarrut's division was organized into two brigades under Joseph Fran√ßois Fririon and Jean Baptiste Pierre Menne plus an artillery battery. It had a total strength of 146 officers and 4,656 rank and file. Fririon's brigade was made up of the 2nd Light and the 36th Line while Menne's brigade had the 4th Light and the 65th Line.Fletcher (2005), p. 33 Howard's division comprised the 1,728-man 1st Brigade under Edward Stopford and the 3,126-strong 2nd Brigade under Halkett. Stopford commanded one company of the 5th Battalion of the 60th Foot, and the 1st Battalions of the 2nd Foot Guards and the 3rd Foot Guards. Halkett's all- KGL brigade included the 1st Light, 2nd Light, 1st Line, 2nd Line, and 5th Line Battalions.Glover (2001), p. 384 San Millan Re-enactors dressed as British soldiers On 18 June 1813, Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune's 5th Division of the Army of Portugal counted 4,800 men. The division included two battalions each of the 15th, 66th, 82nd, and 86th Line Infantry Regiments. That day, one of the brigades was halted at the village of San Mill√°n de San Zadornil. The leading brigade of the Light Division under John Ormsby Vandeleur marched up from the west and attacked. As Vandeleur's men pushed the French from the village and east along the road, Maucune's second brigade appeared from a rocky gorge to the southwest. The second brigade was in the right rear of Vandeleur's brigade, but before the French could take advantage of the situation, James Kempt's brigade arrived on the scene. Kempt immediately attacked and, to avoid being taken in flank and rear, Maucune's second brigade left the road and began to retreat across the hillsides. Noticing what was going on behind him, Vandeleur pulled the 1st Battalion of the 52nd Foot out of line and turned it against the French second brigade. Under the pressure, Maucune's second brigade collapsed and the men ran away. The Light Division was commanded by Charles Alten and consisted of Kempt's 1st Brigade and Vandeleur's 2nd Brigade. The 2,597-man 1st Brigade consisted of the 1st Battalion of the 43rd Foot, eight companies of the 1st Battalion of the 95th Rifles, five companies of the 3rd Battalion of the 95th Rifles, and the 3rd Portuguese Ca√ßadores Battalion. The 2,887-strong 2nd Brigade was made up of the 1st Battalion of the 52nd Foot, six companies of the 2nd Battalion of the 95th Rifles, the 17th Portuguese Line Infantry Regiment, and the 1st Portuguese Ca√ßadores Battalion.Glover (2001), p. 383 The Light Division had 5,484 officers and men, of whom 1,945 were Portuguese.Fletcher (2005), p. 31 Maucune lost about 400 casualties. Of these, about 300 were captured along with the division's baggage train. British losses were about 100 killed and wounded. As the French soldiers fled, many threw away their knapsacks. The division reorganized at Miranda de Ebro. Joseph was furious with Maucune for allowing his division to be routed. The unit was so roughly handled that the king decided it was no longer fit for combat and assigned it to guard a convoy bound for France.Glover (2001), p. 233 The convoy set out from Vitoria at 2:00 AM on the morning of the 21st.Glover (2001), p. 237 The division would be sorely missed at the Battle of Vitoria later that day.

Jain art refers to religious works of art associated with Jainism. Even though Jainism spread only in some parts of India, it has made a significant contribution to Indian art and architecture. In general Jain art broadly follows the contemporary style of Indian Buddhist and Hindu art, though the iconography, and the functional layout of temple buildings, reflects specific Jain needs. The artists and craftsmen producing most Jain art were probably not themselves Jain, but from local workshops patronized by all religions. This may not have been the case for illustrated manuscripts, where many of the oldest Indian survivals are Jain. Jains mainly depict tirthankara or other important people in a seated or standing meditative posture, sometimes on a very large scale. Yaksa and yaksini, attendant spirits who guard the tirthankara, are usually shown with them.  Iconography of tirthankaras  Jina Suparshvanatha in meditation, c. 14th century A tirthankara or Jina is represented either seated in lotus position (Padmasana) or standing in the meditation Khadgasana (Kayotsarga) posture. This latter, which is similar to the military standing at attention is a difficult posture to hold for a long period, and has the attraction to Jains that it reduces to the minimum the amount of the body in contact with the earth, and so posing a risk to the sentient creatures living in or on it. If seated, they are usually depicted seated with their legs crossed in front, the toes of one foot resting close upon the knee of the other, and the right hand lying over the left in the lap. Tirthanakar images do not have distinctive facial features, clothing or (mostly) hair-styles, and are differentiated on the basis of the symbol or emblem (Lanchhana) belonging to each tirthanakar except Parshvanatha. Statues of Parshvanath have a snake crown on the head. The first Tirthankara Rishabha can be identified by the locks of hair falling on his shoulders. Sometimes Suparshvanath is shown with a small snake-hood. The symbols are marked in the centre or in the corner of the pedestal of the statue. The sects of Jainism Digambara and Svetambara have different depictions of idols. Digambara images are naked without any ornamentation, whereas Svetambara ones may be clothed and in worship may be decorated with temporary ornaments. The images are often marked with Srivatsa on the chest and Tilaka on the forehead. Srivatsa is one of the ashtamangala (auspicious symbols). It can look somewhat like a fleur-de-lis, an endless knot, a flower or diamond-shaped symbol. The bodies of tirthanakar statues are exceptionally consistent throughout the over 2,000 years of the historical record. The bodies are rather slight, with very wide shoulders and a narrow waist. Even more than is usual in Indian sculpture, the depiction takes relatively little interest in the accurate depiction of the underlying musculature and bones, but is interested in the modelling of the outer surfaces as broad swelling forms. The ears are extremely elongated, suggesting the heavy earrings the figures wore in their early lives before they took the path to enlightenment, when most were wealthy if not royal. Sculptures with four tirthanakars, or their heads, facing in four directions, are not uncommon in early sculpture, but unlike the comparable Hindu images, these represent four different tirthanakars, not four aspects of the same deity. Multiple extra arms are avoided in tirthanakar images, though their attendants or guardians may have them. Architecture famous Ranakpur Jain temple build in 15th century Like Buddhists, Jains participated in Indian rock-cut architecture from a very early date. Remnants of ancient jaina temples and monasteries temples can be found all around India, and much early Jain sculpture is reliefs in these. Ellora Caves in Maharashtra, and the Jain temples at Dilwara near Mount Abu, Rajasthan. The Jain tower in Chittor, Rajasthan is a good example of Jain architecture. Modern and medieval Jains built many Jain temples, especially in western India. In particular the complex of five Dilwara Temples of the 11th to 13th centuries at Mount Abu in Rajasthan is a much-visited attraction. The Jain pilgrimage in Shatrunjay hills near Patilana, Gujarat is called \\"The city of Temples\\". Both of these complexes use the style of Solanki or MƒÅru-Gurjara architecture, which developed in west India in the 10th century in both Hindu and Jain temples, but became especially popular with Jain patrons, who kept it in use and spread it to some other parts of India. It continues to be used in Jain temples, now across the world, and has recently revived in popularity for Hindu temples. Palitana Jain Temples A Jain temple or Derasar is the place of worship for Jains, the followers of Jainism. Jain architecture is essentially restricted to temples and monasteries, and secular Jain buildings generally reflect the prevailing style of the place and time they were built. Derasar is a word used for a Jain temple in Gujarat and southern Rajasthan. Basadi is a Jain shrine or temple in Karnataka. The word is generally used in South India. Its historical use in North India is preserved in the names of the Vimala Vasahi and Luna Vasahi temples of Mount Abu. The Sanskrit word is vasati, it implies an institution including residences of scholars attached to the shrine. Temples may be divided into Shikar-bandhi Jain temples, public dedicated temple buildings, normally with a high superstructure, typically a north Indian shikhara tower above the shrine) and the Ghar Jain temple, a private Jain house shrine. A Jain temple which is known as a pilgrimage centre is often termed a Tirtha. The main image of a Jain temple is known as a mula nayak A Manastambha (column of honor) is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples. It has four 'Moortis' i.e. stone figures of the main god of that temple. One facing each direction: North, East, South and West.http://www.pluralism.org/religion/jainism/introduction/tirthankaras  History = Earliest depictions of Jain deities (3rd-2nd centuries BCE) = ayodhya excavation Figures on various seals from the Indus Valley Civilisation bear similarity to jaina images, nude and in a meditative posture. The Lohanipur torso is the earliest known jaina image (presumed to be Jain because of the nudity and posture), and is now in the Patna Museum. It is also one of the earliest Indian monumental sculptures in stone of a human, if the dating to the 3rd century BCE is correct; it might be from about the 2nd century CE. Bronze images of the 23rd tirthankara, PƒÅr≈õva, can be seen in the Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai, and in the Patna Museum; these are dated to the 2nd century BCE. The carved Kankali Tila architrave with centaurs worshipping a Jain Stupa, is Mathura art, of circa 100 BCE, showing Hellenistic influence. The early Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, are a number of finely and ornately carved caves built during 2nd-century BCE excavated by King Kharavela of Mahameghavahana dynasty. = Early reliefs (1st century BCE) = Chamukha image, 1st century CE Chitharal Jain Monuments is the earliest Jain monument in the southernmost part of India dating back to first century BC. The Chausa hoard is the oldest of group of bronzes to be found in India. The bronzes have varied dates, from between the Shunga and the Gupta periods, from (possibly) the 2nd century BC,Pal, 151 to the 6th Century AD. = Jain art at Mathura under the Guptas = A sandalwood sculpture of MahƒÅvƒ´ra was carved during his lifetime, according to tradition. Later the practice of making images of wood was abandoned, other materials being substituted. The Chausa hoard, Akota Bronzes, Vasantgarh hoard are excavated groups of bronze Jain figures. = Jain art between 5th-9th century = The Badami cave temples and the constructed Aihole Jain monuments were built by Chalukya rulers in the 7th century, and the Jain parts of the Ellora Caves date from around this period. The earliest of the large group of Jain temples at Deogarh were begun, and in general the excavation of new rock-cut sites ceased in this period, as it also did in the other two main religions. Instead stone-built temples were erected. Jain caves, Ellora were built around the 8th century. = Medieval period (8th-16th century) = The Gommateshwara statue is dedicated to the Jain figure Bahubali. It was built around 983 A.D. and is one of the largest free standing statues in the world. Decorated manuscripts are preserved in jaina libraries, containing diagrams from jaina cosmology. Most of the paintings and illustrations depict historical events, known as Panch Kalyanaka, from the life of the tirthankara. Hansi hoard is the bronze hoard dating back to 8th-9th century.  Ayagapata  Upper Half of Ayagapatta with Tirthankara and other sacred symbols, circa 1st Century CE Ayagapata is a type of votive slab associated with worship in Jainism. Numerous such stone tablets discovered during excavations at ancient Jain sites like Kankali Tila near Mathura in India. Some of them date back to 1st century C.E. These slabs are decorated with objects and designs central to Jain worship such as the stupa, dharmacakra and triratna. A large number of ayagapata (tablet of homage), votive tablets for offerings and the worship of tirthankara, were found at Mathura. Sculpture Kankali Tila architrave with Centaurs worshipping a Jain Stupa, Mathura art, circa 100 BCE Sculpture seems to have been part of Jain tradition since the last centuries BCE, but probably was mostly in wood, which has not survived. The earliert known examples of Jain sculpture are stone architraves of the 1st century BCE, found in the Art of Mathura, particularly from the Jain mound of Kankali Tila. Perhaps the most famous single Jain work of art is the Gommateshvara statue, a monolithic, 18 m statue of Bahubali, built by the Ganga minister and commander Chavundaraya around 983. It is situated on a hilltop in Shravanabelagola in the Hassan district of Karnataka state. This statue was voted as the first of the Seven Wonders of India. Smaller bronze images were probably for shrines in homes. A number of medieval collections of these have been excavated, probably deposited when populations fled from wars. These include the Vasantgarh hoard (1956, 240 pieces), Akota Bronzes (1951, 68 pieces, to 12th century), Hansi hoard (1982, 58 pieces, to 9th century), and the Chausa hoard (18 pieces, to 6th century). Each of the twenty-four tirthankara is associated with distinctive emblems, which are listed in such texts as Tiloyapannati, Kahavaali and Pravacanasaarodhara. The Jivantasvami images represent Lord Mahavira (and in some cases other Tirthankaras) as a prince, with a crown and ornaments. The Jina is represented as standing in the kayotsarga pose.

In addition, many Jain manuscripts were illustrated with paintings, sometimes lavishly so. In both these cases, Jain art parallels Hindu art, but the Jain examples are more numerous among the earliest survivals. The manuscripts begin around the 11th century, but are mostly from the 13th onwards, and were made in the Gujarat region. By the 15th-century they were becoming increasingly lavish, with much use of gold. The manuscript text most frequently illustrated is the Kalpa S≈´tra, containing the biographies of the Tirthankaras, notably Parshvanatha and Mahavira. The illustrations are square-ish panels set in the text, with \\"wiry drawing\\" and \\"brilliant, even jewel-like colour\\". The figures are always seen in three-quarters view, with distinctive \\"long pointed noses and protruding eyes\\". There is a convention whereby the more distant side of the face protrudes, so that both eyes are seen. Rishabha, the first tirthankara, is usually depicted in either the lotus position or kayotsarga, the standing position. He is distinguished from other tirthankara by the long locks of hair falling to his shoulders. Bull images also appear in his sculptures. In paintings, incidents of his life, like his marriage and Indra's marking his forehead, are depicted. Other paintings show him presenting a pottery bowl to his followers; he is also seen painting a house, weaving, and being visited by his mother Marudevi.  Samavasarana  Depiction of Samavasarana Depiction of Samavasarana, the divine preaching hall of the tirthankara, is a popular subject in Jain art. Samavasarana is depicted as circular in shape with the tirthankara sitting on a throne without touching it (about two inches above it). Around the tirthankara sit the ganadharas (chief disciples) and every living beings sit in the various halls. It can be shown in paintings, and elaborate models are also made, some occupying a whole room. Symbols The symbol of Ahimsa in Jainism The swastika is an important Jain symbol. Its four arms symbolise the four realms of existence in which rebirth occurs according to Jainism: humans, heavenly beings, hellish beings and non-humans (plants and animals). This is conceptually similar to the six realms of rebirth represented by bhavachakra in Buddhism. It is usually shown with three dots on the top, which represent the three jewels mentioned in ancient texts such as Tattvartha s≈´tra and Uttaradhyayana s≈´tra: correct faith, correct understanding and correct conduct. These jewels are the means believed in Jainism to lead one to the state of spiritual perfection, a state that is symbolically represented by a crescent and one dot on top representing the liberated soul. The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes ahimsƒÅ in Jainism with ahi·πÉsƒÅ written in the middle. The wheel represents the dharmachakra (Wheel of the Dharma), which stands for the resolve to halt the sa·πÉsƒÅra (wandering) through the relentless pursuit of ahimsƒÅ (compassion). In Jainism, Om is considered a condensed form of reference to the Pa√±ca-Parame·π£·π≠hi, by their initials A+A+A+U+M ('). According to the Dravyasamgraha by Acharya Nemicandra, AAAUM (or just Om) is a one syllable short form of the initials of the five parameshthis: \\"Arihant, Ashiri, Acharya, Upajjhaya, Muni\\". The Om symbol is also used in ancient Jain scriptures to represent the five lines of the ·πÜam≈çkƒÅra Mantra. In 1974, on the 2500th anniversary of the nirvana of MahƒÅvƒ´ra, the Jain community chose one image as an emblem to be the main identifying symbol for Jainism. The overall shape depicts the three loka (realms of rebirth) of Jain cosmology i.e., heaven, human world and hell. The semi-circular topmost portion symbolizes Siddhashila, which is a zone beyond the three realms. The Jain swastika is present in the top portion, and the symbol of Ahi·πÉsƒÅ in the lower portion. At the bottom of the emblem is the Jain mantra, Parasparopagraho Jƒ´vƒÅnƒÅm. According to Vilas Sangave, the mantra means \\"all life is bound together by mutual support and interdependence\\". According to Anne Vallely, this mantra is from s≈´tra 5.21 of Umaswati's Tattvarthas≈´tra, and it means \\"souls render service to one another\\". The five colours of the Jain flag represent the Pa√±ca-Parame·π£·π≠hi and the five vows, small as well as great: The Ashtamangala are a set of eight auspicious symbols, which are different in the Digambara and ≈övƒìtƒÅmbar traditions. In the Digambara tradition, the eight auspicious symbols are Chatra, Dhvaja, Kalasha, Fly- whisk, Mirror, Chair, Hand fan and Vessel. In the ≈övƒìtƒÅmbar tradition, these are Swastika, Srivatsa, Nandavarta, Vardhmanaka (food vessel), Bhadrasana (seat), Kalasha (pot), Darpan (mirror) and pair of fish.

The Adloyada parade is a tradition dating back to the early days of Tel Aviv, in 1912. During the days of the Yishuv, the Adloyada was a mass event; it was resumed after the state of Israel was established. The name is derived from the rabbinic saying in the Talmud that one should revel on Purim by drinking \\"until one no longer knows\\" (ad de-lo yada, Aramaic: ◊¢÷∑◊ì ◊ì÷∞÷º◊ú÷∏◊ê ◊ô÷∏◊ì÷∑◊¢) the difference between \\"blessed be Mordecai\\" and \\"cursed be Haman\\".Jewish Virtual LibraryShoshana Kordova, Word of the Day Adloyada, Haaretz, February 21, 2013 History \\"David Ben-Gurion\\" and \\"Gamal Abdel Nasser\\" in the 1956 Adloyada parade in Tel Aviv David Ben-Gurion float at the Adloyada parade, 1998 The first Adloyada parade was initiated by Avraham Aldema, a teacher and co- founder of \\"Hevre Trasek\\", and was held in Tel Aviv during Purim in 1912. This parade was characterized by provocative costumes and pranks. According to several testimonies, the parade of 1912 was very colorful and beautiful. It consisted of giant puppets, a marching band and hundreds of children wearing their Purim costumes. Throughout the years, the parade became a permanent tradition of Purim. These events were held parallel to the famous celebrations that were organized by Baruch Agadati. Agadati's merriments had become extremely profitable, and so were criticized harshly by \\"Hevre Trasek\\" for being over commercialized. Tel Aviv's Adloyadas were complemented with luxurious Purim balls, created by Baruch Agadati. Throughout the years, the parades were expanded and their path was moved from Herzl Street to Allenby Street and to Ibn Gabirol Street upon the establishment of the state of Israel. During the 1930s, every Adloyada had a specific theme, for example the tribes of Israel (in 1934), and the achievements of the Yishuv. During that time, Tel Aviv's Purim events attracted many tourists from all around Israel and from abroad. As opposed to European states, where carnivals were a means to break loose and consisted of extreme licentiousness, aggressiveness and protest, the Tel Aviv event had different features. The main carnival, despite its new name Adloyada, was characterized by a \\"proper\\" behavior. The municipality issued annual limitations on the Purim celebrations such as a prohibition to use explosives and dress up in costumes that may offend the Jewish religion or the Israeli nation. Despite the censorship and the sanctions, there were a few costumes and parades that didn't obey the rules and used the public festivity to express social protest, and thus made their mark on the city. During the 1928 carnival, with the theme \\"10 years to the national home\\", Hevre Trasek presented a 10-candle Menorah (as a symbol to Balfour's statement); instead of candles there was a rude gesture and the sign \\"free Aliya, Jews in the top clerical work\\". In one of the \\"Menorah\\" balls (Menorah was a club founded by veterans) in 1927, Avraham Atkind won the costume competition for his costume: \\"balancing the clerk's salary in the Palestine government\\". Atkind's hat had a scale and a photograph of the residence of the British commissioner in the magnificent Augusta Victoria building in Mount Scopus, as well as a poem, expressing the discontent of the gap between the British clerk's salary and the salaries of local Israelis from all ethnic groups. Gdud Meginei Hasafa (Hebrew: ◊í◊ì◊ï◊ì ◊û◊í◊ô◊†◊ô ◊î◊©◊§◊î, Battalion for the Defence of the Language), an organization in Tel Aviv fighting to make Hebrew the common language in Mandatory Palestine, used Purim to present and to flood the streets with written propaganda. The Gdud documents were distributed during the Purim carnival. In addition, the Gdud held an annual costume competition with the theme of the superiority and importance of the Hebrew language. In the carnival of 1929, the Gdud presented the \\"tower of Babylon\\"; a tower on top of a horse-drawn cart with the slogan \\"revival of the language, revival of the people\\" and \\"words can kill\\". In the main carnival of 1933, there was a puppet of Hitler riding a horse, as part of the parade. On its neck there was a sign saying; \\"kill Jews\\" and next to it there were 2 Jews bleeding to death. The German consul in Jerusalem sent a letter to Tel Aviv Mayor Meir Dizengoff in the matter and demanded an apology, but Dizengoff replied that Purim is a stage for free speech of public opinion. A year later, a huge puppet was presented with a swastika on its back. In 1935, a giant puppet was built, named \\"the profiteering monster\\". On the day of festivities, a public trial was held for the puppet, during which Dizengoff, Menachem Ussishkin, Chaim Weizmann and Yehoshua Hankin ruled that the monster was guilty of various crimes including fraud, spending the people's wealth, and destruction of the achievements of the pioneers. In one of the later carnivals, a group of people dressed as Ku Klux Klan members in order to protest racism in the United States. While Purim festivals became central public events in the 1920s and 1930s for expressing current social issues, the holiday events, overall and despite exceptions, were aimed to strengthen national messages and dominant ideologies. As opposed to its Biblical origin, where Purim constitutes \\"an opposite world\\" (the fool becomes the king and the king is presented as a fool around town), in Tel Aviv the holiday was institutionalized to conserve the social hierarchy and the parades were led by the city's mayor Meir Dizengoff, astride a horse. During the Second World War, the Adloyada tradition was extinguished. After the establishment of the State of Israel The Adloyada tradition was renewed in the Purim of 1955. In the late sixties, the tradition disintegrated in Tel Aviv and the parade was transferred to Holon, although it lacked the unrefined feature of events in the small Tel Aviv. In the 80's an ArchiParhiTura (also spelled ArchiParchiTura; Hebrew: ◊ê◊®◊õ◊ô◊§◊®◊ó◊ô◊ò◊ï◊®◊î) was introduced in Haifa. It was a Purim parade which had giant displays made by Technion architecture students (\\"ArchiParhiTura\\" is the Hebrew combination of the words architecture and \\"archi parhi\\"- which is the biblical expression of vagabond) and set on trucks. The parade went through Herzl Street in the Hadar Hacarmel area and was accompanied by an orchestra. In the last few years, an attempt was made to return to tradition and resume the Adloyada as an important main event in different cities. The name Adloyada In the beginning, the parade was called \\"carnival\\". In 1923, a competition was held in order to find a new permanent name for the parade. Out of 300 submissions, author Isaac Dov Berkowitz's entry Adloyada was chosen. Adloyada means reaching a state of total intoxication. The expression comes from the Aramaic expression stated by Rabbah in the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Megilla: \\"It is the duty of a man to mellow himself ... on Purim until he cannot tell the difference between 'cursed be Haman' and 'blessed be Mordecai'.\\" This means that people should drink on Purim until he reaches a state of not being able to distinguish between the evil Haman and the blessed Mordecai. Among the other submitted suggestions were Hayim Nahman Bialik's entry \\"Pura\\", Tchernichovsky's entry \\"Astoret\\" and Avraham Shlonsky's entry \\"Tzahalula\\".

Educational  White obtained a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from University of South Alabama, an M.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Wichita State University in 1999,Personnel page - website of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Wichita State University and a Ph.D. degree in Physics from Rice University in 2008.Graduate Study Recent Theses - website of the Physics and Astronomy Department of Rice UniversityIcarus Interstellar. \\"Dr. Harold 'Sonny' White\\" , Project Icarus.  Alcubierre \\"warp\\" drive  White attracted the attention of the press when he began presenting his ideas at space conventions and publishing proposals for Alcubierre drive concepts. In 2011, he released a paper titled Warp Field Mechanics 101 that outlined an updated concept of Miguel Alcubierre's faster-than-light propulsion concept, including methods to prove the feasibility of the project. Alcubierre's concept had been considered infeasible because it required far more power than any viable energy source could produce. White re-calculated the Alcubierre concept and proposed that if the warp bubble around a spacecraft were shaped like a torus, it would be much more energy efficient and make the concept feasible. White has stated that \\"warp travel\\" has not yet seen a \\"Chicago Pile-1\\" experiment, a reference to the very first nuclear reactor, the breakthrough demonstration that paved the way for nuclear power.Oswald, Ed. \\"NASA working on faster-than- light space travel, says warp drives are ‚Äòplausible‚Äô\\", ExtremeTech.White, Harold. \\"Warp Field Mechanics 101\\", NASA, Houston, TX.A Discussion of Space- Time Metric Engineering - Digital Library for Physics and Astronomy of Harvard University To investigate the feasibility of a warp drive, White and his team have designed a warp field interferometer test bed to demonstrate warp field phenomena.

The proposed principle of operation for this device was shown to be inconsistent with known laws of physics, including conservation of momentum and conservation of energy. No plausible theory of operation for such drives has been proposed.  Other works  White and his team are also working on several other \\"breakthrough space technology\\" projects, including a new thruster concept, another concept White claims works by utilizing effects predicted by quantum mechanics. To support this research, White's team also is developing a \\"micro-balance\\" that is capable of measuring the extremely small forces predicted to be produced by this thruster. To calibrate this balance the team plans to repeat an unsuccessful 2006 Woodward effect experiment, this time using the new micro-balance.

Governance The district is governed by a five-member Board of Education. The incumbent members of the Board of Education are Dolores Rivera (President), Javier Romo (Vice President), Armando Barajas (Clerk), Natalie Ybarra, and Paul Solano. The Board has one non-voting student member from the district's high school who represents the district's whole student body. The Board meets monthly in accordance with California Law. Members of the board are elected by the qualified voters of the district for a term of four years. There are no imposed term limits on board membership. Members of the board receive a no-obligation salary below $300. As may be applicable, half of the board membership is due for election (or reelection) every even numbered year. The most recent board election was for three (3) board seats and was called in November 2013‚ÄîSolano, Rivera, and Romo were chosen. The next board election shall be for two (3) board seats and should be called in November 2018 ‚Äì the membership of Riviera, Romo and Solano shall then be due. The district is part of the La Puente Valley Regional Occupational Program, a collective program with the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District and the Rowland Unified School District. Board members Solano and Romo are the Bassett U.S.D. representatives to the R.O.P. Joint Board of Management; Rivera is also the Joint Board's President. The district is a member of many other educational/ governmental organizations throughout the region/ state/ nation and regularly appoints Board members as delegates to those organizations. Administration The board has the duties of managing the district schools, funds and personnel and as well as the power to hire/ fire said personnel, ordering elections to fill any vacancy (or appoint) and to name a district Superintendent of Schools and other high ranking administrators who form his/ her Cabinet. The former Deputy Superintendent was Dr. Antoine Hawkins. These senior executive administrative officers make up the core Superintendents Cabinet. Taxes and employment The district is currently assessing or levying property taxes upon all real property in the district pursuant to three obligation bonds approved by district voters in recent years. These obligation bonds are consistent with California law and all funds collected are for local usage and supervised by a citizen's bond oversight committee of seven members. There are two of such committees: a Measure E committee (currently composed of four persons and has been renewed once in consequence of Measure E being re approved) and a Measure 'V' committee (yet to be called). The district has a Personnel Commission of three persons, with Mr. John Muraki as its director. The commission is tasked with providing employment related recommendations to the district Superintendent who presents to the Board of Education for their consideration the Commission's recommendations. Associations The Bassett Teachers Association (B.T.A.) and the California School Employees Association (C.S.E.A.) are the two major associations in the district. School sites The district has one comprehensive senior high school (9‚Äì12), a continuation high school (10‚Äì12), an adult education program, a child-development program, three elementary schools (K‚Äì5), one academy (K‚Äì8) and a middle school (6‚Äì8) (which is also a California Distinguished school). The district also owns two other campuses for program usage, Erwin and Flanner. The district's first campus was Bassett Elementary which was closed down and is now part of the lands composing a private community on the corner of Temple and Vineland avenues. It was adjacent to Bassett Park, operated by Los Angeles County. Nearby religious/ private high school Bishop Amat Memorial High School is not operated by the district but is under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. History The district itself, its first school and its only high school are named after Mr. Oscar T. Bassett of El Paso, Texas. It was part of Bassett Township in the late 19th century belonging to John Rowland and William Workman. Bassett Township] was part of Rancho La Puente, a land grant from the then Alta California Governor Pio Pico. This rancho was composed of many farms, fields and groves; predominantly walnuts, citruses, avocados, grapes, etc. The land was sold to many individuals creating the neighboring cities around the area. The district was supervised by a three-member Board of Trustees and had no more than three schools. By the 1960s, Bassett Unified School District became a larger academic entity, however for safety reasons some of the first buildings were destroyed and the property sold. By the 1980s, all campuses/ school sites there today were of existence. In 1998, the small district celebrated its Centennial. The district is located in the unincorporated community of Bassett, and in portions of the unincorporated communities of West Puente Valley, and Avocado Heights and portions of the cities of La Puente, Baldwin Park, West Covina and the City of Industry. Measure V Bassett USD Schools Safety, College/Career Readiness Measure V was on the November 4, 2014 election ballot for voters in the Bassett Unified School District in Los Angeles county, California. A 55 percent supermajority vote was required for the approval of this measure. It was approved by 62.42%. Measure V authorized the district to increase its debt by $30 million through issuing general obligation bonds in that amount to fund major renovations, repairs and upgrades to classrooms and schools throughout the district. Homeowners would be taxed $60 per $100,000 of assessed property value annually. The previous administration under the leadership of Alex Rojas superintendent recognized the need to redesign the district's classrooms and technology infrastructure. Measure V laid the foundation for technology innovation in Bassett Unified School District, which is now recognized for its use of technology and has launched a successful podcast called TOSAs Talking Tech and a 1:1 student device initiative.

It operates two high schools, a middle school and four elementary schools. The district had approximately 4,900 students enrolled in the 2018-2019 school year. Early history Benicia was one of the earliest communities in California to establish a public education system, and the first public school there was opened in 1849 by Reverend Sylvester Woodbridge, Jr., an Old School Presbyterian missionary from Long Island, New York. Woodbridge also established in Benicia the first Protestant church in California. Woodbridge was one of four Presbyterian missionaries sent to California during the Gold Rush in 1849. One of them, Reverend Francis Hart of Missouri, died on the trip to California. The Board of Education in Benicia, which later became the Benicia Unified School District, was organized in May 1850. The board agreed to pay Woodbridge $1000.00 for his work as a teacher that first year, making the payment to him in city bonds. Woodbridge was later appointed the first Commissioner of Common Schools for Solano County. Benicia was California's state capital for just over a year in 1853 and 1854. The state capital was then relocated permanently to Sacramento. By 1855, there were 71 students enrolled in the Benicia school system. Charter school planning The district has investigated the possibility of establishing a charter school but in 2009, was unable to reach an agreement with Pathways Charter Schools to establish one. Pathways operates in five North Bay counties, and has an office nearby in Vallejo, California. Unsuccessful tax measures The district has tried but failed to increase local taxes to better support the schools in recent years. A proposed $105.00 per year parcel tax to give financial support to the district failed by 175 votes in November, 2004. Another parcel tax measure was on the ballot in June, 2006, but was unsuccessful. A six-year, $58.00 annual parcel tax measure was on the ballot in 2010, and received 62.8% of the vote. The measure failed, though because it required 2/3 approval to pass, according to the provisions of California's Proposition 13, a state constitutional amendment approved by the voters in 1978.

Retrieved 14 October 2014.Why we cannot keep the lights on without nuclear energy (Blog post for The Independent) Early life and education Born Susan Elizabeth Burrows on 3 February 1955 in Cumbria, she is the daughter of Lawrence James Burrows, a planning officer for British Rail, and Doris Burrows (n√©e Cherry), a secretary. Ion was educated at Penwortham Girls Grammar School near Preston, Lancashire in the same year as Nancy Rothwell. As a young student, she enjoyed science, which her parents encouraged by letting her do chemistry experiments in the family's kitchen. At school, she took a leadership role as Head Girl from 1972 to 1973 and deputy leader of the orchestra. At 16, Ion won a book on atomic energy as a prize for her O-levels in science, which helped inspire her enthusiasm for the topic. She recalled, \\"When I was in school ... it was quite different. You were given every encouragement possible to do science subjects if you were interested in them\\". Ion went on to study Materials Science at Imperial College London, gaining a first class Bachelor of Science degree and a PhD in Metallurgy in 1979 supervised by F.J. Humphreys and S.H. White. She taught in an inner-city school in London while completing her doctorate, and used supplies from the college laboratories in her lessons to help students become enthusiastic about the industry. \\"Where there is no vision ... the people perish\\", she says. Career and research QED conference in Manchester In 1979, Ion was first hired as a technical officer at British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL). At the time, she and one other woman were the only females working in the chemical engineering department. In 1992, she was promoted to Executive Director of Technology, a position Ion held within the organisation until 2006. During this time, nuclear or atomic energy was viewed as a valuable source of energy, along with the existing coal industry, and a necessary part of rebuilding post-war Britain. It was, according to Ion, an exciting industry with a vibrant research and development program and great prospects. As she told Jim Al- Khalili in a 2013 interview for BBC Radio Four, \\"Nothing over time has changed my view of that\\". As technical director of BNFL, Ion held a seat on Tony Blair's Council for Science and Technology and has been credited with persuading Blair to change Labour's official government's policy on nuclear power. Ion's work, along with David King, took about 10 years of educating government officials to consider the scientific evidence surrounding the issues of nuclear power and renewable energy to inform policy. She helped advise Gordon Brown on long-term energy policies. In 2004, Ion was among 180 women invited to a \\"Women's Theme Day\\" luncheon at Buckingham Palace in recognition of her contributions to the field of science and technology. Ion was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng) in 1996 and was a vice-president from 2002 to 2008. In 2006, Ion was appointed visiting professor of Imperial College and admitted to the Fellowship of the college in 2005. =Nuclear power and renewable energy= Sue Ion at QEDCon Ion has studied energy supplies for more than 30 years. She spent a lot of time early in her career advising government officials about nuclear reactors and countering the negativity caused by the incidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. Ion supports the development of smaller, modular versions of nuclear reactors for their economy of size, portability and cost. These smaller reactors would, most likely, be housed on existing nuclear sites licensed for that purpose. Ion views her biggest challenge is \\"persuading decades-worth of politicians that nuclear energy is really needed.\\" Her position is that renewable energy sources (particularly wind power), coal and nuclear power will be necessary components of Britain's energy policy moving forward. =Science education and gender stereotypes= In Ion's outreach as a spokesperson for the nuclear power industry, she has expressed a belief that more needs to be done to attract women into the field of engineering. She has expressed concerns that some areas of the educational system still view engineering as a subject only for males. While major institutions may support the idea of females entering the field of science and engineering, Ion notes that grade schools under the current system may not provide the prerequisite coursework early enough in students' academic careers for them to be successful at university. Ion supports educational programs that support all students, regardless of gender, to explore science and develop the skills necessary to replace what the Royal Academy of Engineering views as a retiring workforce. In response to a report commissioned by the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) discussing the UK's plans for future energy production, she cautions: \\"There will be an unprecedented demand for new infrastructure to support the changes in the energy industry. There are not enough people going into university to study engineering and provide all the turbine specialists, heavy electrical engineers and construction engineers that will be required\\". =Committee service= *EU Euratom Science and Technology Committee (Chair since 2010) *Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board (Chair) *Board of Governors of Manchester University (since 2004) *Health and Safety Laboratory in Buxton (board member, 2006‚Äì2014) *Council for Science and Technology (2004‚Äì2011) *MacRobert Award Judging Panel for the Royal Academy of Engineering (Chair, 2015) *Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (Member, 1994‚Äì2001) *Council for The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) (Member, 2005) *UK's Fusion Advisory for the Research Council (Chair) =Selected publications= *For and Against with G.

Railway connections New Gitaldaha railway station is on the broad gauge Alipurduar-Bamanhat branch line. Local trains link the area to larger stations at Cooch Behar and Alipurduar from where trains are available for places all over the country. The area was agog with railway activity in the 19th-20th century. The Assam Behar State Railway linked Parbatipur to Katihar, with a metre gauge line in 1889. in the early 1900s, the Eastern Bengal Railway extended railways to Lalmonirhat, Gitaldaha (via Mogalhat), Bamanhat, Golokganj and other places, thereby connecting Assam to Katihar, in Bihar, via North Bengal. In 1901 Cooch Behar State Railway built the narrow gauge line from Gitaldaha to Jayanti, near the Bhutan border. Shortly thereafter, the line was upgraded to meter gauge. The Lalmonirhat-Mogalhat-Gitaldaha route was functional when India and Pakistan agreed in 1955 for resumption of railway traffic between the two countries, and it included movement of cross traffic via Mogalhat through the Eastern Bengal Railway. A portion of the bridge across the Dharla River at was washed away by floods in 1988.

The owners of the building have not commented on whether it was legally or illegally sold and removed.\\"Borough Searches for Missing Boy, Last Seen on Wall\\", New York Times, (February 28, 2013), https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/world/europe/give-us-our-banksy-mural-back- londoners-say.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& When the mural disappeared in February 2013 it was listed for sale on an on-line site and later appeared for sale at the Fine Art Auctions Miami for half a million dollars ($500,000).

It is the first album of new material released since 2007's The Turn, and a marked return to her electronic roots. While creating the album Moyet stated that it was not aimed at the charts, though the album debuted at number five on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 13,536 copies, Moyet's highest-charting studio album since Raindancing reached number two in 1987. The Minutes received overwhelmingly positive reviews from music critics, many of whom referred to the album as her \\"best in decades\\". Background Moyet announced on BBC Radio 6 Music that her new album with Guy Sigsworth would be released in 2012. However, in February 2012, Moyet announced on Twitter that ‚ÄúI appear to have forfeited my recording deal because I won‚Äôt do reality TV. No-one needs to make an album that badly. Tea anyone?‚Äù In a 13 June 2012 interview with Touchbase, Moyet confirmed that she was still recording her album and that she was not rushing it, stating she could not envisage it being released before January 2013. When describing its sound and theme, Moyet said, \\"It's quite dark and definitely not aimed at the charts... it has an electronic bias, but isn‚Äôt retro. I‚Äôm not listening to anything current or referring back to anything with this album and they [the songs] aren‚Äôt influenced by what‚Äôs going on. It will stand apart.\\" On 22 January 2013 it was announced via Moyet's official Facebook page that she had signed a worldwide deal with the London-based record label Cooking Vinyl. On 31 January 2013 it was revealed in a press release that the album was set to be released in May 2013. Included in the release were quotes from both Rob Collins, and Moyet. On 18 February 2013, it was revealed via Facebook that the new album would be titled The Minutes along with one of its tracks \\"Changeling\\" made available as a free download via Moyet's newly relaunched website. The Minutes is described as \\"a unique collection of captivating songs that incorporate elements of high-end modern pop, club sounds, R&B; and electronic experimentation.\\" =Title= In an interview with Graham Norton during his BBC Radio 2 show on 23 March 2013, Moyet explained the meaning behind the album's title: \\"Basically, we all feel slightly cheated when our life does not end up being this stream of joy and one thing that you do understand when you come middle aged is that it was never about that, it was always a lie, that it was always about fantastic minutes that are suspended in years, and that‚Äôs what this is about... all the years of fighting to make a creative record for myself rather than do a covers album. These are my minutes.\\" In a May 2013 interview with The National, Moyet went onto reveal that she was inspired by the film, The Tree of Life. \\"Right at the end of the film there's this scene that lifts your spirits immeasurably. It summed up how I feel at the age of 51, which is that our lives are about brilliant little minutes suspended in years. But those minutes aren't necessarily very dramatic or specific, so I put the album title in small letters.\\" Moyet also states that she wrote the song \\"Filigree\\" after viewing The Tree of Life and that that's where the reference to \\"the minutes\\" derives. \\"I went to see The Tree of Life, it was a rainy weekend afternoon, I was with my husband and it was sort of like we fell into a cinema. There was a line outside, the people were going in and obviously it‚Äôs an art house film and these people were leaving in droves. These people looking for mainstream entertainment. You see them go. We sat there. We were caught by the visual beauty, perplexed by the seeming lack of narrative. But, either way you sit there for almost an hour and you find yourself involved in watching it and moving with the pace. At the same time, you still don‚Äôt quite understand your experience. Then, in the last five minutes of the film is a wonderful, redemptive scene, which really kind of sums up what this album [The Minutes] means to me. It's like the whole chorus and you jump too soon and that can relate to suicide, that can relate to your relationship; a project that‚Äôs become tortuous. Anything you fear and you‚Äôre on your last legs and you jump right before this glorious redemptive minute.\\" In the June 2013 issue of Gay Times, Moyet revealed other considered titles: \\"Changeling\\" (\\"but Toyah had an album called Changeling\\"). \\"'Alison Moyet And The Man From,' ...because I wanted Guy in there somewhere. Because like I say this felt like a band album to me as opposed to a solo singer album. Because we worked together as a band, we didn't work together as a producer-client.\\" Compositions The Minutes is a highly charged electronic, synthpop-driven album with hints of R&B; and with moments of pop rock and house. According to Moyet, \\"schizophrenia\\" is the theme of the album. Songs \\"Remind Yourself\\" and \\"When I Was Your Girl,\\" Moyet states are about \\"the opposing dialogues within oneself.\\" \\"Rung By The Tide\\" resulted from researching the Middle Ages where \\"great swathes of the English coastline fell into the sea and priories and monasteries and their bell towers were lost.\\" \\"Then I started to think about what it would feel like to be a bell [laughs]. I thought, maybe the bell would be completely delighted about it. Maybe the bell thought: \\"All this time you've told me when I could sing and when I could stop, but now that's over.\\" Critical reception The Minutes received positive reviews. The Daily Express described the album as \\"brilliant\\" and \\"cinematic, energetic and sitting as prettily today as it might have 25 years ago, the minutes is stirring and beautiful,\\" referring to the album's sound being a return to her early electronic and sythnpop days. Digital Spy also echoed the Daily Express' critique of the album being a return to Moyet's earlier but added that the album's sound moved into\\"new territory.\\" Clash Magazine hailed the album Moyet's \\"finest album in twenty years.\\" eMusic dubbed The Minutes \\"her best album, by a considerable margin.\\" Jeremy Williams of The Yorkshire Times referred to Moyet's work with producer Guy Sigsworth \\"essentially a rather captivating meeting of two creative minds, who together have crafted a near perfect contemporary masterpiece that could soon be hailed a classic.\\" Q Magazine called Sigsworth Moyet's \\"musical soulmate\\" and said of The Minutes: \\"this is her best LP in decades.\\" Liverpool Sound and Vision described the album as \\"...going back to the house you were born in and seeing that it has irrevocably changed but has all the old pleasant memories running around its corridors.\\" Charles Pitter for Pop Matters referred to Moyet as versatile, and that her music can \\"appeal to hipsters and housewives, or even housewives in hipsters, and the minutes is a great type of hybrid.\\" In the United States, Orlando Weekly called The Minutes a \\"triumph\\" and that the album \\"towers above almost everything before it in the Moyet oeuvre.\\" Singles The first single \\"When I Was Your Girl\\" received its exclusive first play on Ken Bruce's BBC Radio 2 show on 19 March 2013. The music video for the single premiered the very same day via the UK web site Digital Spy. Moyet was accompanied by her real-life daughter in the video. The single's official release date was set for 1 April. It was performed at The Graham Norton Show on the BBC and on ITV1's This Morning. It featured on Radio 2's 'A' list and on other radio stations including \\"106.9FM WHCR\\" and \\"Kingstown Radio\\". It was announced on 29 May 2013 that the second single taken from The Minutes would be \\"Love Reign Supreme\\". A music video for the single was shot at Moyet's Bush Hall show. The third single off the album \\"Changeling\\" was released on 14 October 2013. Promotion=\\"Tasters\\"= Aside from offering a free download of the track \\"Changeling\\" via her official web site, Moyet began release \\"tasters\\", short clips of each album track uploaded every Monday, Wednesday and Friday on a SoundCloud account throughout April 2013. Because an amateur shot live performance of the song \\"Rung by the Tide\\" from her Bush Hall gig failed to appear on YouTube, Moyet held off on releasing a clip of the eleventh and final track on the album. =Bush Hall gig= Moyet announced \\"Taking the Minutes\\", a one-off gig at London's Bush Hall to be held 18 April 2013 to launch the album. The gig was described as 'the single opportunity to hear every track of the album ‚Äì live and in order ‚Äì by the three people who made it.' Moyet is to be joined by co-producer Guy Sigsworth and Chris Elms. Fans were made aware of the possibility of a few Yazoo tracks, reworked by Sigsworth, making the set list. A live EP was released on 13 August 2014, Live at Bush Hall featuring the songs: \\"When I Was Your Girl,\\" \\"Filigree,\\" \\"Nobody's Diary,\\" and \\"Don't Go.\\" =Tour= On 25 February 2013, a tour was announced to promote the album.

It was first broadcast on ITV on 17 February 1992. Plot=Act 1: The Heart Attack Man and the Postbox= Mr. Bean goes out to post a letter. After using a series of keys to retrieve his car's ignition key, he discovers that the battery is flat, so decides to take the bus. Upon reaching the bus stop, the man already waiting there has a heart attack, terrifying Bean. Bean tries to revive him by stomping on him, stuffing pills down his throat, trying mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (with the man's magazine) and using electric shock treatment using jump leads connected to a nearby lamppost. The electric shock treatment initially works, but he forgets to remove the jump leads from his hands when the man offers a handshake, giving the man another electric shock, making him pass out again. An ambulance arrives; while the paramedics treat the man, Bean uses the ambulance battery to jump start his Mini. Bean drives off and leaves the ambulance disabled due to a dead battery, forcing the paramedics to call for a replacement. Afterwards, Bean heads to a postbox, but on the way he accidentally swallows his postage stamp. He offers to post a letter for a lady, pretends that he has posted it but hangs on to it until she is gone, so that he can use it for his own letter. He removes the stamp using steam from his car radiator, and sticks it to his own letter using a sweet stuck (since the first episode) to the inside of his pocket. He sticks it to his own letter with a fist (when using just one finger to stick it down does not work). The postman arrives to empty the postbox, just as the lady returns to find her letter on the ground. She complains to the postman that there was a stamp on her letter, but now it is gone. Bean hides inside the postbox to avoid getting reprimanded by the postman for the theft of the stamp. He gets locked inside for an unknown amount of time (the original commercial break occurred here), though as the postbox had a \\"1\\" showing, it was probably all night. He keeps trying to call out for attention, which goes unnoticed, and then he waves his tie out of the hole only to attract a dog who yanks on it, nearly choking him. When he is finally released (by another postman), he loses his car keys down a drain and gets a bus home. He waits at the bus stop with another man. The man gets on the bus but Bean cannot as all the seats are full, forcing Bean to wait for the next one. =Act 2: The Holiday= At his flat, Bean packs for a holiday but his small briefcase does not have enough space for his clothes, as well as some cans of baked beans. He reduces the size of his belongings (often using scissors) to fit them into the case by cutting a pair of trousers (before realising he already has a pair of shorts), breaking his toothbrush, pouring some toothpaste down the sink, taking just one sandal and packing a flannel instead of a towel. He does not have the heart to cut up Teddy. After finally managing to fit his things in the small case, he reaches under the bed, only to discover that he has a larger case. However, because his small briefcase is already full, he just puts it into the larger suitcase, along with the one thing he could not pack before, a book. Bean boards a train and reads the book, sitting across from another man who is also reading. When the man reaches a funny moment in his book, he begins laughing loudly and continuously, distracting Bean. Bean struggles to cover his ears to avoid the laughter, eliciting curious stares when the man looks up. He finds some chewing gum under the carriage seats, pushes it into his ears and thus it works to block out the noise. Finally, the train conductor comes in and asks to check their tickets. Bean is startled by his presence, and accidentally throws his book with the ticket tucked inside out of the train window, and the man bursts out laughing once more. Eventually, Bean boards an aeroplane, but he is forced to look after a sick boy next to him. He tries to cheer the boy up by various means, by sticking magazine bits on his face to amuse him, playing with a self-inflating life jacket (it later flies out of Bean's seat) and by blowing air into a paper bag and trying to pop it. Realising the bag has holes in it, he starts searching for another empty bag. While his back is turned, the boy vomits into a sick bag and offers the bag to Bean, who takes it unaware and pops the bag between his hands. The act ends with the popping noise of the bag and the screen goes black, leaving the outcome ambiguous and ending the episode. Cast *Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean *Roger Sloman as the heart attack man *Su Douglas as the lady with the letter *John Rolfe as the postman *Stephen Frost as the laughing man *Nick Hancock as the train conductor *Eryl Maynard as the air hostess *Hugo Mendez as the sick boy Deleted scene Mr. Bean waits at a bus stop behind a man; when the bus arrives, the man gets on, but the driver turns Bean away. Determined to be the first in line for the next bus, Bean tries to cut ahead of a woman (Matilda Ziegler) with a pram (who gets in line ahead of Bean when he steps away for a moment), and a blind man (Robin Driscoll). Soon after Bean manages to get to the front, several people join the end of the line, and the bus arrives. But the bus does not stop in front of Bean, it drives on for another few yards ‚Äì just far enough so that the end of the line logically becomes the front of the line. However, the door of the second bus is at the back; Bean ends up at the end of the line and is left behind again. Production Location sequences for this episode were mostly shot on 35 mm film at Dalgarno Gardens in Kensington and studio sequences were recorded before a live audience at Thames Television's Teddington Studios. The end credits of this episode is one of two to perform a volte-face: showing the reverse of the opening titles where Mr. Bean is sucked back into the sky, and the only one to do so with the street scenery. This is the last episode of to feature the name of the episode in the first opening sequence. In later episodes, the main title of \\"Mr. Bean\\" is displayed. The episode title is then displayed once the episode starts. =Casting= *Roger Sloman, who played the blind man in the pilot episode, returned as the heart attack man. *Nick Hancock, who played the thief in Mr. Bean Goes to Town, returned as the train conductor. *Hugo Mendez, who played the boy playing with the radio-controlled boat model in The Trouble with Mr. Bean, returned as the sick boy. *Stephen Frost, who played the laughing man, previously co-starred with Rowan Atkinson in Witchsmeller Pursuivant, the fifth episode of The Black Adder, and in Corporal Punishment, the second episode of Blackadder Goes Forth. Legacy The joke of Mr. Bean popping a vomit filled bag is reused in the movie Bean, although in this episode the scene ends without showing the outcome. The joke of Mr. Bean cheering up the boy on the plane using paper strips torn from a magazine is reused in Mr. Bean's Holiday, cheering up the Cannes Film Festival jury member and film director's son Stepan on the train. \\"Car Trouble\\" from Mr. Bean: The Animated Series was inspired by Act 1. Act 4 indirectly segued into Act 3 of the later episode Hair by Mr. Bean of London in which he departed the train, only to find out that he does not have his ticket. Both acts later inspired the train scene from Mr. Bean's Holiday. Censorship The heart attack scene was edited out when broadcast on Nickelodeon UK.

He retired from the Marine Corps in 2014 upon relinquishing command of MARSOC. Early life Clark is a native of Sioux Falls and was raised in South Dakota and Minnesota. He graduated from South Dakota State University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Commercial Economics in 1980. According to a Q&A; interview with the SDSU alumni association while Clark was serving as the Chief of Staff of Special Operations Command he said his most memorable moment while attending SDSU was \\"without a doubt, Hobo Day.\\" Military career Upon completion of Officer Candidate School in June 1981 Clark was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. Afterwards, he attended Flight School and was designated a Naval Aviator in May 1983. He was assigned to fly the CH-53 Super Stallion after additional training at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina. He participated in both Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield. His first involvement with Special Operations came as a result of a pilot exchange program with the U.S. Air Force where Clark was assigned to the 20th Special Operations Squadron operating the MH-53J Pave Low. While at the 20th SOS Clark was deployed in support of Operation Deliberate Force during the Bosnian War. In From 2001 to 2002 Clark served as Operations Officer in Task Force K-Bar during the early years of Operation Enduring Freedom. Clark attended the United States Army War College from 2002 to 2003. While a student there he wrote a 67-page Strategy Research Project titled Should the Marine Corps expand its role in special operations. He was the Director of Operations at United States Special Operations Command from 2009 to 2011.

In 1927, it became a luxury train between Paris Nord and Amsterdam CS, via Brussels, and was operated by its original operators, along with the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) and the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL). In 1937, the CF du Nord became part of the SNCF. Two years later, in 1939, the √âtoile du Nord was suspended upon the outbreak of World War II. In 1946, the train was revived, initially as a Rapide.

It was first broadcast as a Christmas special on ITV on Tuesday 29 December 1992 as part of ITV's Christmas schedule and was watched by 18.48 million viewers during its original transmission. This was the last episode to be co-written by Richard Curtis and the last to be broadcast by Thames Television on behalf of the ITV network. It also marks the last appearance of Mr. Bean's girlfriend, Irma Gobb (Matilda Ziegler) in the original television series until reappearing on Mr. Bean: The Animated Series eleven years later.  Plot = Act 1: Christmas Shopping = Seeking to prepare for the big day, Mr. Bean ventures into town on Christmas Eve and visits Harrods to buy some Christmas decorations, continuing his trend of behaving inappropriately in such a prestigious department store. After parking directly at the front of the store, and harassing a man dressed as Santa Claus by plucking on his false beard, Bean proceeds to test two different baubles, going with one that bounces off the ground (after the other one simply smashes). He then looks to test out some Christmas lights, and managing to get into a storeroom while an employee is busy dealing with a customer, tries it out on a socket being used for the store's exterior lights, plunging the entire exterior of the store into darkness in the process. As the employee sorts out his purchases, Bean spots the shop's Nativity scene display and performs a creative yet inaccurate story by playing around with it and some nearby toys, first by making some of the figurines shush anything that could wake the baby Jesus, having a shepherd figurine round up some toy sheep, and then having two toy tanks and a toy Dalek battle with a toy Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually having the little baby Jesus figurine airlifted by an angel attached to a magnet hanging down from a toy helicopter to the bedroom of a doll house alongside his parents' figurines. His fun is soon disrupted by the store manager - introducing a toy policeman into the Nativity scene to halt proceedings - who hands him his purchases and watches as Bean leaves the shop. Following his fun, Bean heads to a local Christmas market, where he spots another man dressed as Father Christmas. Again he pulls the man's beard, only to find that it is real, prompting Bean to take a quick exit while the man recovers. Later, he meets up with his girlfriend, Irma Gobb, and is dragged to the shop window of a jeweller's, whereupon she tries to give him the message that she wants a sparkly ring in the display by pointing at it through the glass. Bean nods to her in agreement (albeit expressing disgust when she kisses him on the cheek), and heads into the shop, much to Irma's delight. Afterwards, Bean volunteers to help the conductor of a Salvation Army brass band performing \\"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\\" at the market collect money in his bucket; in doing so, he catches a young pickpocket with a wallet in his hand and forces him to surrender all the items he stole, include cash and jewellery (notably, Bean retrieves a ring the boy hid in his mouth by smacking him on the head). Bringing these to the conductor, who secretly decides to check out what he brought back (implying that he is greedily stealing the goods rather than donating them), Bean finds himself conducting the band, and has some fun with them, before having them conduct the same song with an upbeat, jazzy feel to it, earning a big round of applause from the crowd. With the conductor now back, Bean attempts to buy a Christmas tree from a stand, only to get to the stand just as the last two trees are bought. Frustrated and wanting a tree, he cuts down the market's large tree, attaches it to the roof of his Mini and drives home with it, with everybody at the market (including the band and the conductor) completely oblivious to the theft. = Act 2: Christmas Eve = Back at his flat, Bean has set up a piece of his stolen Christmas tree with his new lights and his bauble, before he leans out of his window and pushes the rest of the tree away, letting it crash onto the street below. He then writes a few Christmas cards (all of the same design) and sealing them in envelopes, then stepping outside and posting them to himself. Satisfied with his decoration, Bean searches a cupboard for some Christmas crackers, but is underwhelmed by the lack of a loud pop from one, and so decides to take out the fuses of the other crackers and stuff them all into one to make a \\"super cracker\\". Warming up his flat with a fire, enjoying a box of chocolates and drinking a glass of sherry, Bean hangs up three stockings in his room: one for Teddy, one for himself, and one for a tiny mouse living in a hole, then he tries to find something good to watch on TV but finds only war and horror films. As he turns his TV off, he hears muffled singing coming from his door, whereupon opening it he finds a small group of young carol singers performing \\"Away in a Manger\\". Deciding to watch them perform from his seat as if he was watching TV, Bean soon becomes bored and rudely shuts the door on them just as they finish the song before heading for bed. = Act 3: Christmas Day = The following morning, Bean wakes up excited that it's Christmas morning, and proceeds to check the stockings ‚Äì his is a sock that has the other sock of the pair inside; Teddy's contains a tin that holds a pair of drawing pin eyes within; the mouse's contains a piece of cheese, which Bean immediately places onto a mousetrap. Bean soon gets to work in the kitchen on preparing the large turkey he won at the market, but while stuffing it, his watch comes off and gets lost inside. Unable to find it, Bean sticks his head into the turkey, whereupon he finds himself unable to pull it off just as his girlfriend, Irma arrives. After attempting to cover up his predicament, Irma eventually helps him to remove it, allowing Bean to recover his watch but at the cost of the turkey as it is lost out of the window in the process. With the turkey gone, Bean and Irma instead eat cranberry sauce sandwiches along with carrot slices for dinner, whereupon Irma refuses to give Bean his present until she gets a Christmas kiss, only for him to distract her and rudely snatch it, ignoring her anger as he finds it to be a model ship. Realizing he is being forgetful, Bean produces Irma with her present, only for her excitement to turn into confusion and disappointment when he reveals that he bought her the portrait in the jeweller's display that was next to the ring, believing it to be what she really wanted. When Irma begins to sob quietly, he reveals that he \\"forgot the main bit\\", and produces a ring box, which surprises Irma. When she opens the box, however, she discovers that it contains not the ring she wanted, but a screw-in hook for hanging the portrait. A furious Irma storms out of the flat, leaving Bean puzzled and muttering to himself \\"What was wrong with it?\\" Realizing that she cannot pull his super cracker with him, he decides to do it himself, saying \\"Merry Christmas\\" to himself crestfallen. As he does so, the act cuts to a view of his window from the street, along with a sudden white flash and a loud banging sound.

Allen - Santa outside Harrods * Owen Brenman ‚Äì Harrods clerk * John Warner - Band conductor * Lee Barrett - Pickpocket * Jonathan Stratt  Production  Most of the location scenes - set in a market - were shot on videotape in Kingston. Studio sequences were recorded before a live audience at Thames Television's Teddington Studios. Following its broadcast on American cable television network HBO, this episode won the 1995 CableACE award for best comedy special. A scene for this episode was cut out for broadcast but retained in . In the scene, Bean participates in a \\"guess the weight\\" competition, with the large turkey from the episode, being the prize, and cheats to win it by using a hidden set of scales below the counter for the competition, alongside a calculator, whereupon the turkey is thrown into the boot of his Mini once he wins it. For unknown reasons, the A&E; DVD release (distributed in the US by New Video) does not contain this scene. A number of elements were used as inspiration for other programs. The 'lights on a well known building being accidentally switched off' gag is used by comedian Peter Kay at the end of his Live at the Top of the Tower DVD, while the turkey scene was inspired for a scene in an episode of Friends titled \\"The One with All the Thanksgivings\\", and later led to an adaptation for the film Bean, though it was cut out of the international release (outside North America) and reserved for a special feature section entitled \\"Bean Scenes Unseen\\". Another turkey gag was used in the Mr. Bean: The Animated Series episode \\"Dinner for Two\\". During the nativity scene, Bean introduces a military marching band while humming \\"The British Grenadiers\\", which is used as the theme tune to Blackadder Goes Forth, another sitcom Rowan Atkinson starred in. Deleted scene of this episode includes an extra scene where Bean attempts to win the turkey he eventually ended up wearing on his head. The contest being to guess the turkey's weight, he sneaks a pair of scales to the counter; having already weighed himself, he subtracts his weight from the combined weight using a Casio calculator. The person in charge of the contest is shocked when Bean guesses the exact weight (to three decimal places) and wins it. The A&E; DVD release (distributed in the US by New Video) is missing this scene.  Censorship  The scene where Mr Bean buys the turkey was removed from broadcasts on Disney Channel (Southeast Asia). The scene where Irma Gobb helps Mr. Bean to get the turkey off was also edited out when broadcast on Nickelodeon UK.

According to Basil of Caesarea, some prisoners taken captive in a Gothic raid on Cappadocia around 260 preached the gospel to their captors and was martyred. One of their names was Eutychus. Bishop Dionysius of Caesarea sent messengers to the Goths to ransom captives and there was still a written record of these attempts in Basil's time. Two main outbreaks of persecution of Christians by the 4th- century Gothic authorities are recorded, in 347/8 under Aoric (according to Auxentius of Durostorum) and between 367 and 378 under Aoric's son, the iudex (kindins) Athanaric. The persecution of Christians under Athanaric shows that Christians were still a minority among the Tervingi in the 370s, but that they had become numerous enough to be considered a threat to Gothic culture. It is remarkable that Athanaric did not persecute Christians in general, but specifically converted Goths, while Christian foreigners were left alone. Athanaric's motive was thus the protection of the Gothic nation and its gods and not the persecution of Christianity as such.Wolfram 1990, \\"Ulfilas and the Beginning of the Conversion of the Goths\\" (75-84), p. 83. The Terving ruler Athanaric opposed the spread of Christianity among the Goths, fearing that the new faith would destroy Gothic culture. According to the historiographer Sozomenos (Eccl. Hist. 6.37), Athanaric appointed Winguric (Wingureiks, Wingourichos, also Jungeric) to eradicate the Christian faith from the Gothic lands. In Crimea, Winguric placed an idol in a chariot and paraded it before a tent used by Christians for their church service; those who worshipped the idol were spared, and the rest were burned alive in the tent. A total of 308 people died in the fire, of which only 21 are known by name. This happened in or close to the year 375. A few years later, during the reign of Valentinian and Theodosius (383-392), Gaatha, the widow of a peer of Winguric's, and her daughter Dulcilla (or Duclida, Duklida) gathered the remains of twenty-six martyrs and with he help of some priests and a layman named Thyellas transferred them to Cyzicus. The martyrs who died under Athanaric's persecution known by name are three clerics and 18 laypeople (11 men, 7 women). To this are added the four children of Wereka and Batwin (two sons and two daughters), plus an anonymous man who came to the tent and confessed Christ as Winguric was about to burn it and was martyred together with the others, to arrive at the number of \\"twenty-six martyrs\\" whose remains were transported by Gaatha. The 21 martyrs known by name are recorded with multiple variants in manuscript tradition: *Werekas (or Ouerkas, Vercus), a papa or priest, *Batwin (or Bathouses, Bathusius), a bilaifs (minister?) *Arpulas (Arpilus), a monk, *eleven laymen: Abippas (Abibus), Hagias (Agnus), Ruias (Reas), Egathrax (Igathrax), Eskoes (Iscous), Silas, Sigetzas (Signicus), Swerilas (Sonerilas), Swemblas (Suimbalus), Therthas (Thermus), and Philgas (Phillus), *seven laywomen Anna, Alas (Alla), Baren (Beride, also recorded as Larissa), Moiko (Monco), Kamika (Mamika), Oneko (Virko), and Anemais (Animais, Animaida), The list includes Syrian, Cappadocian and Phrygian names, even though the victims were all Goths. This may reflect the Christian practice of assuming a new \\"Christian name\\" at baptism, and in any case documents the close connection of the Gothic church with those of Asia Minor (where the invading Goths in the mid 3rd century first came into contact with Christianity). The \\"26 Gothic martyrs\\" are commemorated in Orthodox Christianity on 26 March, but in the Gothic calendar fragment on 29 October (gamin√æi marwtre √æize bi Werekan papan jah Batwin bilaif. aikklesjons fullaizos ana Gut√æiudai gabrannidai \\"remembrance of the martyrs who with Werekas the priest and Batwin the bilaif were burned in a crowded church among the Goths\\"). The same fragment for 23 October proscribes remembrance of \\"the many martyrs among the Gothic people, and of Fridaric\\" (√æize ana Gut√æiudai managaize martwre jah Fri√æareikeis), Fridaric being an otherwise unknown Gothic martyr. Later (medieval?) Eastern Orthodox martyrologies enumerate \\"Twenty-six Martyred Goths\\", listing the 21 names given above, but adding one Constans as a twelfth layman, plus queen Gaatha along with her daughter Dulcilla and her son Agathon. Sabbas the Goth was martyred in 372 in what is now the Wallachia region of Romania. Nicetas the Goth was also martyred in 372.

Statue Origin  The original idea for the statue derived from Tampa attorney and avid Tampa Bay Lightning fan, Stephen K. Stuart, who felt that Esposito deserved to be commemorated for his role in getting Tampa a hockey team. Stuart reported, ‚ÄúWhat impressed me was how he fought to get this franchise, and I don't think anyone else could have gotten it here if it wasn't for his hockey pedigree.\\" With the help of private donors, Stuart raised $60,000 to create the statue.  Statue Creation  Production of the statue began in 2009, and it took nearly 3 years to complete, (Stuart, 2012). Stuart commissioned sculptor, Steven Dickey, of Dickey Studios in Tampa, to produce the statue. Dickey utilized a process known as the lost wax casting to cast the statue, (Stuart, 2012). Richard Frignoca of Bronzart Foundry, Inc. in Sarasota, bronzed the statue. Additionally, Jeff Downing of Downing Design in Tampa, created the hockey puck on which the statue rests, (Stuart, 2012).

It is a non- denomination designated burial ground, and thus has Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Chinese burial areas. The Jewish section contains a Holocaust Memorial, erected in 1959. It was opened in 1942, and historically was part of one of Johannesburg's original farms, Farm Waterval, which was purchased in 1887 by two Geldenhuys brothers in the hope of finding gold. While they did not find gold, Louw Geldenhuys employed Boer War veterans to build the Emmarentia Dam, and leased smallholdings with fruit trees. In 1993, 13 hectares were donated to the city for public recreation and, eventually with the other sections, became the Johannesburg Botanic Gardens, Marks Parks Sports Club and the Westpark Cemetery. Today, the sprawling cemetery is the resting place of thousands of Johannesburg residents, and has separate Chinese, Muslim, Jewish, Christian and SANDF burial areas. Many ornate gravestones and mausoleums can be found throughout the park. Westpark is an active cemetery, as burials are still allowed and performed. Military plot There are also specific areas for servicemen who have died in the line of duty. This cemetery contains war graves of 617 Commonwealth service personnel of World War II, mostly burials from military hospitals and an airfield, besides 21 non-Commonwealth war graves and seven non-war graves that are in care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The Military Plot contains the Johannesburg Cremation Memorial to 69 Commonwealth service personnel cremated at Johannesburg's Braamfontein Crematorium during the same war and is found directly behind the Cross of Sacrifice.

Funded by NASA, and developed and operated by the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy, the system currently has two 0.5-meter telescopes located apart, at Haleakala (ATLAS-HKO) and Mauna Loa (ATLAS-MLO) observatories. ATLAS began observations in 2015 with one telescope and its two-telescopes version has been operational since 2017. Each of the two telescopes surveys one quarter of the whole observable sky four times per clear night, for a four-fold coverage of the observable sky every two clear nights. Accessed 2018-04-14. The project has obtained NASA funding for two additional telescopes in the Southern hemisphere. Once operational, those two telescopes will improve ATLAS's four-fold coverage of the observable sky from every two clear nights to nightly, and will fill its current blind spot in the far southern sky.  Context  Major astronomical impact events have significantly shaped Earth's history, having been implicated in the formation of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system, the origin of water on Earth, the evolutionary history of life, and several mass extinctions. Notable prehistorical impact events include the Chicxulub impact, 66 million years ago, believed to be the cause of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. The 37 million years old asteroid impact that caused Mistastin crater generated temperatures exceeding 2,370 ¬∞C, the highest known to have naturally occurred on the surface of the Earth. Throughout recorded history, hundreds of Earth impacts (and exploding bolides) have been reported, with some small fraction causing deaths, injuries, property damage, or other significant localised consequences. Stony asteroids with a diameter of enter Earth's atmosphere approximately once per year. (solution using 2600kg/m^3, 17km/s, 45 degrees) Asteroids with a diameter of 7 meters enter the atmosphere about every 5 years, with as much kinetic energy as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima (approximately 16 kilotons of TNT), of which their air burst represents about one third, or 5 kilotons. These relatively small asteroids ordinarily explode in the upper atmosphere and most or all of the solids are vaporized. Asteroids with a diameter of strike Earth approximately twice every century. One of the best- known recorded impacts in historical times is the 50 meter 1908 Tunguska event, which leveled several thousand square kilometers of forest in a very sparsely populated part of Siberia, Russia. Such an impact over a more populous region would have caused locally catastrophic damage.Yau, K., Weissman, P., & Yeomans, D. Meteorite Falls In China And Some Related Human Casualty Events, Meteoritics, Vol. 29, No. 6, pp. 864‚Äì871, , bibliographic code: 1994Metic..29..864Y. The 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor event is the only known impact in historical times to have resulted in a large number of injuries, with the potential exception of the possibly highly deadly but poorly documented 1490 Ch'ing-yang event in China. The approximately 20 meter Chelyabinsk meteor is the largest recorded object to have impacted a continent of the Earth since the Tunguska event. Future impacts are bound to occur, with much higher odds for smaller regionally damaging asteroids than for larger globally damaging ones. The 2018 final book of physicist Stephen Hawking, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, considers a large asteroid collision the biggest threat to our planet. In April 2018, the B612 Foundation reported \\"It's a 100 per cent certainty we'll be hit [by a devastating asteroid], but we're not 100 per cent sure when.\\" In June 2018, the US National Science and Technology Council warned that America is unprepared for an asteroid impact event, and has developed and released the \\"National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy Action Plan\\" to better prepare. Larger asteroids can be detected even while far from the Earth, and their orbits can therefore be determined very precisely many years in advance of any close approach. Thanks largely to Spaceguard cataloging initiated by a 2005 mandate of the United States Congress to NASA, the inventory of the approximately one thousand Near Earth Objects with diameters above 1 kilometer was for instance 97% complete as of 2017. The estimated completeness for 140 meter objects is around one third, and slowly improving. Any impact by one of these known asteroids would be predicted decades to centuries in advance, long enough to consider deflecting them away from Earth. None of them will impact Earth for at least the next century. We are therefore largely safe from globally civilisation- ending kilometer-size impacts for at least the mid-term future, but regionally catastrophic sub-km impacts remain a possibility at this point in time. Sub-150m impacting asteroids would not cause large scale damage but are still locally catastrophic. They are much more common and they can, by contrast to larger ones, only be detected when they come very close to the Earth. In most cases this only happens during their final approach. Those impacts therefore will always need a constant watch and they typically cannot be identified earlier than a few weeks in advance, far too late for interception. According to expert testimony in the United States Congress in 2013, NASA would presently require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched. This time could be much reduced by pre-planning a ready to launch mission, but meeting the asteroid and then deflecting it by least the diameter of the Earth after its interception would each need several uncompressible additional years.  Naming  The Last Alert part of the system name acknowledges that ATLAS will find smaller asteroids years too late for potential deflection but would provide the days or weeks of warning needed to evacuate and otherwise prepare a target area. According to ATLAS project lead John Tonry, \\"that's enough time to evacuate the area of people, take measures to protect buildings and other infrastructure, and be alert to a tsunami danger generated by ocean impacts\\". Most of the more than 1 billion rubles damage and of the 1500 injuries caused by the 17-m Chelyabinsk meteor impact in 2013 were from window glass broken by its shock wave. With even a few hours advance warning, those losses and injuries could have been much reduced by actions as simple as propping all windows open before the impact and staying away from them.  Overview  The ATLAS project was developed at the University of Hawaii with US$5 million funding from NASA, and its first element was deployed in 2015. This first telescope became fully operational at the end of 2015, and the second one in March 2017. Replacement of the initially substandard Schmidt corrector plates of both telescopes in June 2017 brought their image quality closer to its nominal 2 pixels (3.8\\") width and consequently improved their sensitivity by one magnitude. In August 2018, the project obtained US$3.8 million of additional NASA funding to install two telescopes in the Southern hemisphere, one of which will be hosted by the South African Astronomical Observatory,Project that spots city-killing asteroids expands to Southern Hemisphere.\\"SAAO to contribute to the global effort to detect Near Earth Objects.\\" and the other most likely installed in Chile. This geographical expansion of ATLAS will provide visibility of the far Southern sky, more continuous coverage, better resilience to bad weather, and additional information on the asteroid orbit from the parallax effect.Atlas: How it works. Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The full ATLAS concept consists of eight telescopes, spread over the globe for full-nightsky and 24h/24h coverage. As long as their radiant is not too close to the Sun, and for the current Hawaii-based system not too far into the Southern hemisphere, the automated system provides a one-week warning for a diameter asteroid, and a three-week warning for a one. By comparison, the February 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor impact was from an object estimated at diameter. Its arrival direction happened to be close to the Sun and it therefore was in the blind spot of any Earth-based visible light warning system. A similar object arriving from a dark direction would now be detected by ATLAS a few days in advance. Breakthrough: UH team successfully locates incoming asteroid As a by-product of its main design goal, ATLAS can identify any moderately bright variable or moving object in the night sky. It therefore also looks for variable stars, supernovae, non-impacting asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets.  Design and operation  The full ATLAS concept consists of eight 50-centimeter diameter f/2 Wright-Schmidt telescopes, spread over the globe for full-night-sky and 24h/24h coverage, and each fitted with a 110 Megapixel CCD array camera. The current system consists of two such telescopes operating 160 km apart on Haleakala and Mauna Loa in the Hawaiian Islands, ATLAS1 and ATLAS2.ATLAS Telescope 2 Installed on Mauna Loa, Ari Heinze Retrieved April 7, 2017. A major feature of these telescopes is their large 7.4¬∞ field of view ‚Äî about 15 times the diameter of the full moon ‚Äî of which their 10 500 √ó 10 500 CCD camera images the central 5.4¬∞ √ó 5.4¬∞. This system can image the whole night sky visible from Hawaii with about 1000 separate telescope pointings. At 30 seconds per exposure plus 10 seconds for simultaneous camera readout and telescope repointing, each ATLAS unit can therefore scan the whole visible sky a little over once each night, with a median completeness limit at apparent magnitude 19.ATLAS Technical Specifications Since the mission of the telescope is to identify moving objects, each telescope actually observes one quarter of the sky four times in a night at approximately 15-minute intervals. This allows to automatically link multiple observations of an asteroid into a preliminary orbit, with some robustness to the loss of one observation to overlap between the asteroid and a bright star, and to predict its approximate position on subsequent nights. Apparent magnitude 19 is classified as \\"respectably but not extremely faint\\", and is approximately 100 000 times too faint to be seen with a naked eye from a very dark location. It is equivalent to the light of a match flame in New York viewed from San Francisco. ATLAS therefore scans the visible sky in much less depth, but much more quickly, than larger surveying telescope arrays such as University of Hawaii's Pan- STARRS. Pan-STARRS goes approximately 100 times deeper, but needs weeks instead of half a night to scan the whole sky just once. This makes ATLAS better suited to finding small asteroids which can only be seen during the just few days that they brighten dramatically when they happen to pass very close to the Earth. NASA's Near Earth Observation Program initially provided a US$5 million grant, with $3.5 million covering the first three years of design, construction and software development, and the balance of the grant to fund the systems operation for two years following its entry into full operational service in late 2015.Oliver, Chris.

History  The autonomous status of Kosovo within the Yugoslav federation was removed in 1989 by President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá of the Serbian Republic and direct control was established from Belgrade. Pristina Municipality, under control from Belgrade took a small parcel of land belonging to Pristina University and gave it to the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC). An Orthodox cathedral was planned by the SOC on university land in the city centre and construction was begun in 1992 as part of a policy of Serbian nationalism. Its foundations were laid in the campus of the University of Pristina at a time when Albanian students and professors were expelled from the university buildings and there was an extensive campaign of serbization going on in Kosovo. Work on the building halted due to dwindling funds and recommenced in March 1995. The external structure was completed by 1998 yet the deteriorating security environment in Kosovo led to the suspension of construction. Construction of the building was not welcomed by the predominantly Muslim population of Kosovo. Following the war and international military intervention in 1999, Kosovo became a protectorate under a United Nations administration (UNMIK) and a failed attempt was made to destroy the building with explosives that did little damage to the structure. Seen by Kosovo Albanians as a symbol of Milo≈°eviƒá's rule, the building was vandalised in the aftermath of the war. The UNMIK administration held concerns that the Orthodox church could become a target due to retaliatory violence and the building was placed under protection along with other Orthodox churches of Kosovo. In 2003 the building became part of discussions by the public over its future. Pristina Municipality, with an Albanian majority population became part of the newly established UNMIK provisional government institutions of Kosovo and it proposed four uses for the building: preserved as is, demolition, turned into a museum and usage for some alternative purpose. Albanian controlled Pristina municipality was openly hostile to the structure. Based in Gracanica at the time, the SOC stated that it was against the proposals viewing them as an attack toward a religious location and an attempt to remove the Serb presence from Pristina. The SOC compiled property documents demonstrating ownership over multiple locations within Pristina such as the Kosovo parliament, the accommodation buildings of Pristina university and its library. To counter municipal plans, the SOC suggestion was that these buildings be turned into museums. UNMIK eventually overruled Pristina Municipality over its proposals. During the riots of 2004 by Kosovo Albanians against Serbs that resulted in the destruction or damage of 35 religious monuments, nearly all Orthodox churches, the building in Pristina was not damaged. Between 2005-2007 the international community sought a political solution for Kosovo's status and it generated the Ahtisaari Plan which outlined supervised independence and a provision to protect SOC property. In relation to the cathedral building, the matter became interpreted through property rights over land ownership and identification of the owner. The Ahtisaari Plan also made the Kosovo government through its Culture Ministry in charge of protecting the property of the SOC, an arrangement which the Serbian church did not acknowledge. To breach the impasse, the EU special representative (EUSR) in Kosovo selected a neutral mediator, ambassador Moschopoulos of the Greek Liaison Office to discuss matters between the government and church. After the communication mechanism was created, efforts were devoted toward resolving ownership of the site. The unfinished interior in October 2012 In the aftermath of Kosovan independence (2008), communication was nonexistent between the government and SOC. During 2009 the Kosovo Culture Ministry contacted the International Civilian Office (ICO) that through the EUSR contacted the SOC and international neutral organisations mediated between both sides to reach a resolution. The SOC produced title deeds showing the transfer of the site during the mid 1990s and they were allowed permission to undertake any future construction on the site. By 2011 public debate and administrative constraints over the structure had ceased and the SOC devoted its efforts to raising money for restoration and future constriction of the building. In 2015 construction still had not resumed on the site and other administrative and legal issues had arisen, while the building was vandalised. The church in the winter The future of the building remains uncertain. Ownership of the building and the land on which it is located is disputed between the current University of Pristina and the Serbian Orthodox Church. Seen as a symbol of the rule of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, various Kosovo Albanian intellectuals have called for its demolition. In response for calls for its demolition, the church has been heavily desecrated and vandalised. Throughout 2016 the church was set on fire and turned into a public toilet and dumpsite. In 2016 the University of Pristina failed in a four-year bid to take ownership of the land on which the church was built on through judicial proceedings. The Kosovo Appeals Court granted land ownership rights of the church grounds to the Serbian Orthodox Church, however the University of Pristina continues to block attempts to refurbish the church.

He directed the box office hit A Werewolf Boy (2012). Career After majoring in industrial design at Seoul National University, Jo Sung-hee joined the Seo Taiji Company and Olive Studio, a children's animation company. During his time at these companies, he worked on numerous music videos and animated films as an assistant director. He also directed the 52-episode animated television series Barnacle Lou (Îî∞Í∞úÎπÑ Î£®), which aired on EBS in 2007. Jo then studied film directing at the prestigious Korean Academy of Film Arts (KAFA). He got admitted by submitting a film he made with his friends for pure fun. Among his classmates at KAFA was Yoon Sung-hyun, who would go on to direct Bleak Night. One of Jo's teachers was Oh Seung-uk, screenwriter of award-winning romance Christmas in August, who taught him that \\"a director should trust his own abilities, but should always challenge their own works and expand their experiences.\\" In 2008 he wrote and directed the 43-minute short film Don't Step Out of the House (ÎÇ®Îß§Ïùò Ïßë), in which two impoverished children are menaced by strangers in the basement of a house. The short won several awards in 2009, including Best Picture at the Mise-en-sc√®ne Short Film Festival and the Seoul Independent Film Festival, the Eastar Jet Award (Best Korean Short Film) at the Jeonju International Film Festival, and Third Prize at the Cin√©fondation section of the Cannes Film Festival. It was later included in the omnibus Nice Shorts (released in 2009). As his graduation film for KAFA, Jo made his feature debut in 2010 with End of Animal (ÏßêÏäπÏùò ÎÅù), starring Lee Min-ji and Park Hae-il. Part apocalypse, part horror, part mystery movie, the plot follows a young woman in the last month of her pregnancy who runs into a series of ordeals and uncanny misfortunes while trying to get to her hometown to give birth. The film drew acclaim from local critics and in the international film festival circuit. Jo surprised the film industry in 2012 with his second feature. Unlike his previous films which delved into the intricacies of the human psyche and had been called \\"dark, even grotesque,\\" A Werewolf Boy (ÎäëÎåÄÏÜåÎÖÑ) was a fantasy romance starring popular actors Song Joong-ki and Park Bo-young. Though admittedly commercial, Jo said he didn't compromise a lot in making the film and that he'd \\"always wanted to make a movie that can be widely watched and enjoyed by all generations.\\" It also retained the whimsical sense of humor and creeping sense of doubt that characterized his previous works. The coming- of-age film takes place in a rural Korean town in the 1960s, where a teenage girl meets a feral boy who can neither read nor speak. She teaches him civilized human behavior using a dog-training manual, and the two fall in love, but the mystery of his origins and the townspeople's fear threaten their idyll. After its world premiere at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, domestically the film reached nearly 7 million admissions to become the third best-selling Korean film of 2012 and currently the most successful Korean melodrama of all time. Jo received the 2013 Discovery Award from the Korea Film Reporters Association, and Best New Director from the 2013 Baeksang Arts Awards.

She was a member of Wandsworth London Borough Council from 2006 to 2012. She was elected at the 2015 general election as the first female MP to represent the Telford constituency, and was re-elected in 2017 and again in 2019, with an increased majority of 25.6%. Since 26 February 2020, she has served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Leader of the House of Commons. Early life and career Lucy Allan was born in Cheltenham on 2 October 1964, the daughter of a farmer and a teacher, and grew up near Totnes, Devon. She is related to the Scottish radical socialist suffragette Janie Allan, whose family owned the Allan Line shipping company. Allan was educated at Durham University and Kingston Law School. She has a degree in anthropology and a master's degree in employment law. She joined Price Waterhouse as a trainee in 1987, where she qualified as a Chartered Accountant and specialised in business turnaround, and in 1994 she further qualified as a Chartered Secretary in the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. In 1994, she moved into Investment Management, reaching director level, working for UBS Warburg, Gartmore Investment, De La Rue, Mercury Asset Management and First State Investments. While Head of Investment Trusts at First State Investments, which ran the Scottish American Investment Company (SAINTS) and Scottish Oriental Smaller Companies Trust, she was suspended in September 2003 over alleged plagiarism in statements issued by SAINTS. She was made redundant in January 2004, after First State Investments ceased to manage SAINTS. In 2004, Allan began a master's degree in employment law and set up her employment law consultancy, specialising in discrimination and maternity issues. She became a non-executive director of Wandsworth NHS primary care trust in 2009. She has served as an employment tribunal panellist. Political career Allan was elected as a local councillor to Wandsworth London Borough Council in 2006, representing the Southfields ward, and served until 2012. In March 2013 she was selected as the Conservative Party parliamentary candidate to contest the marginal constituency of Telford in the 2015 general election. She advocated a direct rail link to London from the town and aimed to tackle the high rate of youth unemployment in Telford. =Family First Campaign= After Allan made a visit to her GP seeking help with symptoms of depression following a family bereavement in 2010, Wandsworth Council launched a child protection investigation, claiming Allan's 10-year-old son was at risk of significant harm. In the wake of the controversy which followed, Allan stood down from the Council, and from her directorship with the NHS. In 2011, following legal action by Allan, social services decided to take no further action. Based on her family's experience, she founded Family First Group, a lobby group which campaigns to reduce the number of children in state care, for improvements to the UK child protection system and support for families affected by it. In 2012 Allan fronted a media campaign on child protection injustice, which included an appearance on ITV's This Morning. She used the media coverage to build a political profile for the Family First Campaign, working with Ministers, children's charities, and families to identify and remedy shortcomings in the child protection system. She participated in an edition of ITV's Exposure documentary series on this subject on 15 July 2014, Don't Take My Child. = Death threat controversy = In December 2015 Allan posted on Facebook an email she said she received from a constituent; the email was edited and ended with the words \\"unless you die\\". Allan later acknowledged that she had added those words to the email (saying she had taken them from a different email) ‚Äì leading to accusations of her faking a death threat.Jon Stone, \\"Tory MP Lucy Allan pulls out of BBC interview after being told she can‚Äôt veto questions\\", The Independent, 22 January 2016 Allan temporarily deactivated her Facebook and Twitter accounts following the incident. Allan later apologised for creating a \\"misleading impression\\", and said the controversy was not about her use of social media, but due to \\"activists unhappy they didn't get the MP they wanted\\". =Allegations of bullying staff= In December 2015 Allan was accused of bullying members of staff, and leaving a series of voicemail messages to a sick employee allegedly including a threat of dismissal. On 21 December 2015, a statement about the allegations was published on Allan's website but deleted later in the day. The statement apologised for Allan's voicemail messages, which were publicly released, but stated the bullying allegations were unfounded and was critical of a former employee; the London Evening Standard characterised the statement as \\"a long rebuttal\\". Later in January 2016, Allan acknowledged sending the voicemails was \\"stupid\\" and she regretted shouting at the employee, but denied her actions amounted to bullying. =NHS junior doctors strike= In April 2016 Allan used Facebook to say: \\"Hard-working people in Telford don't get why privileged trainee doctors, on course to earn ¬£100,000 plus, will hold NHS to ransom and deprive ordinary people of emergency care. I don't get it either.\\" Her comments were criticised by junior doctors, with one saying that many of her fellow graduates were still junior doctors who can work ‚Äúhorrific shift patterns‚Äù and move hospital every 12 months. =Advancing \\"libertarian agenda\\"= In January 2016 Allan stated that on national issues her approach in general is to advance within parliament the \\"libertarian agenda\\", to prevent the increasing influence of the state. For example, she was against a sugar tax that was under consideration by her party. Allan voted to leave the EU in the June 2016 referendum. In June 2016 Allan introduced a private member's bill to repeal provisions in the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 to require staff to report possible signs of extremism or radicalisation amongst primary and nursery school aged children, following a number of high- profile cases where the provision was inappropriately used in relation the government's Prevent strategy. =European Union= Allen is a supporter of Brexit, and has argued that the country must be prepared to walk away with a no-deal if necessary. In April 2019, Allan welcomed whom she called the \\"fantastic\\" candidates from the Brexit Party ahead of that year's European elections. She defended the comment after being criticised by Tory loyalists, saying that party loyalties would be \\"eclipsed\\" by the Brexit issue at the ballot box. =Retweet of doctored Keir Starmer video= On 14 May 2020, Allan was criticised after she retweeted a doctored video from a far-right Twitter account which falsely claimed that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer obstructed the prosecution of grooming gangs while he served as Director of Public Prosecutions. Allan was reprimanded for her actions by Conservative whips, but has yet to apologise. Personal life Allan is married to a stockbroker and has a son. They live in Southfields, Wandsworth. Allan also has a constituency house in Lawley Bank, Telford.

He wrote poetry, stories, articles, plays and four novels, the most well known of which is La For√™t (English: The Forest), published in 1935. His first two novels, Les Lys de sang (1922) and Nipsya (1924), were published under the pseudonym Henri Doutremont. He introduced the rose cultivar 'Th√©r√®se Bugnet', named after his sister. Early life Bugnet was born in Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne, Burgundy, France on 23 February 1879. He initially studied toward a Christian priesthood, but left to attend the nearby Universit√© du Dijon and then the Sorbonne in Paris. He worked as a journalist for the monthly publication La Croix, and was briefly named editor-in-chief of La Croix de Haute-Savoie, but then moved to Canada in 1904 with his new wife Julia, initially working in Manitoba, then moving to Alberta in 1905. Georges and Julia had nine children, though the second child, Paul, died in infancy in a fire. Literary career Bugnet wrote novels, poetry, stories, essays, articles, diaries and plays. He had four novels published: Le Lys de sang (1923), Nipsya (1924), Siraf (1934) and La For√™t (1935). The first two were published under the nom de plume Henri Doutremont. His first poetry collection, Voix de la solitude, was published in 1938. Po√®mes was published in 1978. He had articles, poems and short stories published in both French and English in several periodicals, including Le Canada Fran√ßais and Les Id√©es. He was editor of l'Union, the provincial French language paper, between 1924-29. Botanical interests Rose cultivar 'Th√©r√®se Bugnet', a hardy, scented, rose with few prickles, developed by Georges Bugnet Bugnet was a self-taught botanist interested in finding useful trees and shrubs which could survive the harsh Canadian winters and provide income to farmers. He catalogued the local flora and corresponded with professional botanists about them. He spent 25 years breeding roses; his 1950 introduction 'Th√©r√®se Bugnet', an unusual hybrid involving three species, is still in commerce today. He also developed an apple which he called 'Paul Bugnet' and a plum called 'Claude Bugnet'. A forest reserve in Alberta is named after him, in honor of his silvicultural work. Death and legacy Bugnet died on 11 January 1981 in a nursing home in St. Albert, Alberta. He is remembered in the Georges Bugnet Award for Novel, which was set up in the following year.

The poem has been translated into English by David Hawkes as \\"In Praise of the Orange-Tree\\". In the poem, the orange-tree is used as a metaphor for certain human qualities, such as \\"steadfastness\\".Hawkes 1985, 178 Hawkes explains this by the tradition that this type of orange tree is supposed to grow naturally only in the part of China of which the ancient land of Chu was included in (as opposed to the northern plain). The particular orange-tree (ju) mentioned is what David Hawkes calls \\"citrus nobilis\\"; but, this type of orange (or, its hybrids) is now usually botanically referred to as Citrus reticulata, or else by the common name of \\"mandarin orange\\". Symbolism The word ju, meaning \\"orange (fruit or tree)\\" is phonetically reminiscent of the word zh√π (Á•ù), which means \\"to wish or pray for\\", as in the phrase zh√π f√∫ (Á•ùÁ¶è), \\"to wish or pray for good luck\\", thus the orange is symbolically a \\"harbinger of good luck\\".Eberhard 1986, 219 Also in ancient times the emperor gave oranges to his officials,Eberhard 1986, 219; thus the emperor could be said to be like an orange tree, both being a source of orange fruits (and the metaphor could be extended). Meter \\"Ju Song\\" is written throughout in what David Hawkes calls \\"7-plus\\" meter; that is, each line has 7 regular syllables, augmented by a refrain word repeated in each line. In this case, the final syllable of each line is the exclamatory particle ÂÖÆ (xƒ´). Context \\"Ju Song\\" is one of the nine poems of the Jiu Zhang (Nine Pieces) section of the Chu Ci, but is quite different from the other poems in this section; so that, as David Hawkes puts it \\"it is hard to see how it came to be included in the same collection\\".Hawkes 1985, 153 Poem The poem appears to praise a prince or other young man, according to David Hawkes (178), by an extended comparison between the young man and an orange tree. David Hawkes describes the poem as being \\"charming\\". The author is unknown, although as usual with the Chu ci pieces, Qu Yuan has been given attribution, although in this case, this is not to likely given the evidence of the advanced metrical style (Hawkes 1985, 178). The final line of the poem makes an allusion to \\"Bo Yi\\", referring to the pair of brothers whose loyalty to the previous Shang dynasty resulted in that they preferred to starve to death than to symbolically submit to the succeeding Zhou dynasty by eating the produce of the land, which Zhou in their view had usurped from Shang.

The other two stations are: Siliguri Junction and New Jalpaiguri. This is a small station consisting of three platforms, among them two broad-gauge platforms and one narrow-gauge platform. History Siliguri Town railway station in 1881 In 1878, the railway line from Calcutta (later called Sealdah) station to Siliguri was in two stages ‚Äì broad gauge from Calcutta to Damookeah Ghat, on the southern bank of the Padma, across the river in a ferry and then to Siliguri. In 1881, the narrow-gauge line from Siliguri to Darjeeling was added. In 1926, with the Hardinge Bridge in position, the entire Calcutta-Siliguri line was converted to broad gauge and in 1947, following the partition of India the line was severed, as a major portion of the line ran through East Pakistan. In the post-partition era, with makeshift arrangements via Barsoi and Kishanganj being metre gauge and narrow gauge, the focus shifted in 1949 to a new Siliguri Junction railway station and later still, in 1961 to the new broad- gauge station at New Jalpaiguri.

The other two stations are: Siliguri Town and New Jalpaiguri. It has broad gauge and narrow-gauge tracks. It formerly had the distinction of having three gauges but the metre-gauge line from Aluabari Road to Siliguri Junction was converted later into broad gauge. Few years ago train bus used to run between Siliguri Junction to Naksalbari by the metre-gauge line.. History Siliguri Junction in bird's eye view With the railway routes badly disturbed by the partition of India in 1947, Siliguri Town railway station suddenly lost its preeminence as the broad-gauge link to Calcutta running across East Pakistan. With three metre-gauge lines, the new Siliguri Junction railway station became the main railway station in the area. The three metre-gauge lines were linked to Kishanganj and Barsoi, Assam and Haldibari. The narrow gauge Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was there. The short reign was over in the 1960s when a new broad-gauge line linked Siliguri with Calcutta, and subsequently, all railway lines in the area (excepting Darjeeling Himalayan Railway) were converted to broad gauge. The focus shifted in 1960 to a brand new broad-gauge station at New Jalpaiguri. Amenities Amenities at Siliguri Junction include: Waiting room, Retiring room, Tourist Information Centre, Book stalls and some variety stores. Tenzing Norgay central bus terminal is located just outside this railway station and West Bengal Tourism Office is also located nearby. Siliguri Junction has three two- bedded retiring rooms and a four-bedded dormitory. Distance from Siliguri Junction: Bagdogra Airport , New Jalpaiguri railway station , Darjeeling , Gangtok , Thimphu .

The Tenzing Norgay central bus terminal is beside to the Siliguri junction railway station, so long-route buses are also available from near the railway station. = Cars = Siliguri junction railway station is located in the middle of the Siliguri city, so it is very easy to reach the railway station. Ride aggregator services Uber, Rapido, Ola provide rides from the train station to various parts of the city. One can also book private cabs to go Darjeeling, Gangtok and all over hill areas.

It is to be located near Gretna, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, close to the England- Scotland border. The sculpture was approved on 27 February 2013. The project is being promoted by the Gretna Landmark Trust. Background The project was first instigated by local businesses and landowner Alasdair Houston. Other interested parties included both Gretna and Gretna Green and public art manager Jan Hogarth. It is hoped that the sculpture will attract visitors, boosting tourism, and result in social and economic benefits to the area. About 84% of all visitors to Scotland by road pass near Gretna. For the past seven years, meetings have been held with Scottish academics, cultural thinkers and the local community in a series of seminars and workshops run by the Gretna Landmark Project which resulted in the appointment of international architect Charles Jencks as the Trust's Creative Director. In 2011 a competition was launched by the Gretna Landmark Trust called \\"The Great Unknown\\" as a way to get ideas for a new local iconic landmark. Three shortlisted artists and designers collaborated with Jencks on proposals for the landmark. In July 2011 it was announced that Cecil Balmond had won the competition with the Star of Caledonia design. Planning permission was first proposed in 2012. A debate on the proposal was later held in the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh in October 2011 by the two artists. It was also hoped that the sculpture would be built in early 2014, in time for both the 2014 Commonwealth Games and 2014 Homecoming Scotland, and only taking a year to build. However, the projected date then slipped to 2015, which had been designated the UNESCO International Year of Light. This date has slipped past as well. Funding The initial design was expected to cost ¬£3.8 million but this has since risen to ¬£4.8 million. In 2011 Creative Scotland awarded the project ¬£1 million from its capitals investment programme towards its development. However the project has failed to secure further commitments of public funding, leading to Creative Scotland withdrawing its ¬£1 million support and putting the project further into question. In May 2019, a three- year planning extension was granted allowing the team behind the sculpture more time to secure funding. Location The sculpture is to be located in a field opposite the Gretna Gateway Outlet Village, located on the outskirts of the town of Gretna in Scotland. The sculpture will be visible from the nearby A74(M) motorway. Instead of using road signs, the surrounding landscape is to be used as a way to recognise it and to turn crossing the border into a memorable experience. It will also not be far from the River Sark. Design Estimates of the height of the sculpture range from to projected to be twice the size of the Angel of the North. The design is meant to pay homage to innovation within Scotland and be inspired by inventors and innovators, in particular prominent Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, who was famous for his work in electromagnetic theory. The sculpture is to be in a star shape and to be made of galvanised steel and illuminated at night at its tips using \\"subtle lighting\\". The lights will be using LEDs, although the light emissions will be explored in more detail as part of the approval by the council. The sculpture intends to pull together the surrounding hills, the adjacent site and the Solway. The Gretna Landmark Trust have said that the sculpture's aim was to be \\"visually spectacular but meaningful, relating strongly to place and identity\\". Reception Although no objection occurred to the planning application, the design and proposal of the Star of Caledonia has received a mixed reception. The design has been supported by author Ian Rankin who has described it as futuristic and forward looking. A Scottish politician has also described it as fitting, in such an iconic location, novel and inspirational. It is also supported by local businesses including the Gretna Gateway Outlet Village. However, there has been some criticism by local artists and some architectural firms The sculpture was subsequently included in a campaign to raise awareness of James Clerk Maxwell. Research has claimed the sculpture could be worth ¬£16 million in its first year. In an external impact assessment carried out by BOP Consulting on behalf of Dumfries and Galloway Council and public art development company Wide Open, it found that the Star of Caledonia could bring in ¬£2 million from construction, ¬£4 million a year from tourism, up to ¬£10 million in national and international publicity in the first four months and ¬£300,000 locally. The sculpture is expected to attract 70,000 people a year when built. In August 2014, the sculpture received the backing of United Kingdom MP Helen Grant.

Nigro Sansonese was born Joseph Sansonese in Buffalo, NY, where he attended Canisius High School. He was trained in physics and mathematics at Fordham University (Sc.B 1968) (Bronx, NY) and Brown University (Providence, RI). In 1996‚Äì97, he taught a course in the history of science at Stonehill College (Easton, MA) and from 2001‚Äì2009 courses in mathematics and science on St. Croix at the University of the Virgin Islands (Kingshill, VI). Over the course of 30 years he also taught mathematics and science at various high schools, public and private, in the United States and its territories. He retired from teaching in 2012. His main published work is The Body of Myth: Mythology, Shamanic Trance, and the Sacred Geography of the Body, , a nonfiction work of some 400 pages on the relationship between mythology and human biology, that appeared in 1994. He was co-screenwriter of Hurricane Festival, a 1997 feature film, with Chi Y. Lee. His plays include The House on the Point, produced at the Hult Center for the Performing Arts, Eugene, OR, November 1985, and The Mill at Tour d'Ivoire, read at the Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center, North Portland, OR, September 1984, and the Greene Street Theater, New York City, April 1986. Works In addition to his work in print Sansonese has discussed his theory of mythopoesis (Gk., \\"story making\\") in a lengthy 1994 video interview with San Francisco psychologist Dr. Jeffrey Mishlove of Thinking Allowed (PBS). Nigro Sansonese's mythology, elaborated in The Body of Myth: Mythology, Shamanic Trance, and the Sacred Geography of the Body (1994), might be summarized as follows: Early myth-making (before, say, 1000 BC) among archaic peoples‚Äîespecially but not exclusively Indo-European speakers‚Äîmay have originated in an esoteric oral cephelosophy or \\"skull wisdom\\" automatically imparted, primarily to young men at the age of puberty, in secret initiation rituals, during which a venerated ancestral skull may have been displayed for purposes of illustrating the meaning of a particular myth. The aboriginal inspiration for myth, Sansonese argues, lay in heightened awareness (see proprioception) of certain internal bodily activities important in religiously oriented meditation. The means of heightening proprioception are closely guarded meditative techniques orally communicated from teacher (adept) to student, in particular, techniques associated with respiration. Subject to numerous cultural contingencies, the techniques likely first appeared in history many thousands of years ago in the trance-inducing practices of shamans but became ever more systematized, refined, and clarified over time. Because the activities attended to in many meditative traditions, for example, respiration and heart rate, are physiologically fundamental to all human bodies everywhere, an explicit argument of the book is that a proprioceptive interpretation probably applies to all mythologies that are sufficiently archaic in origin, which he defines as no later than approximately 800 BC. About a quarter of the book focuses on interpreting the biblical narratives of Judaism and Christianity. A myth, then, according to Sansonese is a veiled, culturally conditioned description of a trance-inducing technique and resulting proprioceptions. Myths, therefore, on this view are (very) early attempts at articulating what, in 1945, Aldous Huxley called Perennial Philosophy, and simultaneously mystical and practical in their origins. Much of the practical aim of a myth is instruction in what Sansonese calls \\"the art of dying,\\" a narrative prefiguring of the literal experience of somatic death, which is a matter of the practical mastery of an endocrinal event that he suggestively describes as a \\"pituitary catastrophe,\\" in the sense that the pituitary gland initiates it. In Nigro Sansonese's view, death is an event triggered by the endocrine system.Interviewed by Joshua Schrei on The Emerald, Nos. 12, 23 (2019), 30 (2020). In sum, Nigro Sansonese defines an \\"authentic myth\\" as \\"an esoteric description of a heightened proprioception,\\"Dr. Georg Feuerstein (Autumn 1995), review: The Body of Myth, Quest (Theosophical magazine), 8:3, p. 91. meaning a verbal description, albeit a necessarily imperfect one, of a literal experience undergone by an adept while in a trance state, which, very critically, must be distinguished from mere symbolism or metaphor. Understanding religious practice (praxis) eclipses understanding religious belief (dogma) in its importance for understanding both the origin and the meaning of a specific myth of sufficient antiquity (see also his lengthy discussion of the Eleusinian Mysteries). In deep meditation the region of the cranial sinciput, or forehead, is in emphasis, particularly the glabella, a fissure between the brows esoterically described in myth, Sansonese claims, as a portal or entry such as the Sc√¶an Gate into Troy (see Book VI of The Iliad and passim) or the Hellespont on the way to Colchis, mythic locale of the Golden Fleece, to give just two of numerous examples cited. Another vivid illustration is the mythical figure Sisyphus (, S√≠syphos), king of Corinth, whose myth Sansonese explores in detail, and whose name, he suggests, is literally an onomatopoetic rendering of the sussurant sound (\\"siss phuss\\") the moving breath makes in the nostrils, the breath of course being an important object of meditative concentration (a bija in yoga). Repetitive inhalation‚Äìexhalation are described esoterically in the myth as an up‚Äìdown motion of Sisyphus and the boulder on a hill. Various animals, particularly strenuous breathers such as horses, swine, and asses, describe respiration in myth. The principle is widely distributed. For example, Jesus' entry into Jerusalem while riding on an ass' colt is a Semitic myth equivalent to Odysseus' entry into Troy inside a horse. As a compendium Sansonese provides five axioms to guide the interpretation of archaic mythopoesis. A critical contention of the book is that myths are not so much symbols natural to human ideation, as Carl Jung proposed in 1933, as they are culture-specific, esoteric descriptions of somatic activity proprioceived during exalted trance states, for example, those attained through, but not limited to, yoga (see also samyama and pranayama).http://junginvermont.blogspot.com/2010/02/body-and-archetype- presentation.html. Clinical Perspectives: Body and Archetype, Luanne Sberna, February 1, 2010 (The C.G. Jung Society of Vermont), Retrieved April 29, 2014. Nigro Sansonese's work also has relevance to the scientific study of consciousness, specifically, by proposing that an implicit epistemology‚Äînamely, a description of knowledge that is in its nature, i.e., essentially, a priori, also known as consciousness‚Äîunavoidably orders the fundamental laws of physics differentially, from the (macroscopically) perceived and proprioceived 17th-century mechanics of Isaac Newton to the indispensability of mathematics in the 20th-century quantum mechanics of Werner Heisenberg. That development was interpreted by Sansonese as one of successively elaborating a physics originally based on empirical knowledge obtained via proprioception and perception into a physics that is a conformal map onto the psychodynamics of cognition. A succinct summary of that assertion would be \\"Ontology is epistemology: Every state of being is ipso facto a state of knowing.\\" On such a view, quantum mechanics arguably might be said to be more \\"meta-physics\\" than physics.

Details Stochastic quantization serves to quantize Euclidean field theories, and is used for numerical applications, such as numerical simulations of gauge theories with fermions. This serves to address the problem of fermion doubling that usually occurs in these numerical calculations. Stochastic quantization takes advantage of the fact that a Euclidean quantum field theory can be modeled as the equilibrium limit of a statistical mechanical system coupled to a heat bath. In particular, in the path integral representation of a Euclidean quantum field theory, the path integral measure is closely related to the Boltzmann distribution of a statistical mechanical system in equilibrium. In this relation, Euclidean Green's functions become correlation functions in the statistical mechanical system. A statistical mechanical system in equilibrium can be modeled, via the ergodic hypothesis, as the stationary distribution of a stochastic process. Then the Euclidean path integral measure can also be thought of as the stationary distribution of a stochastic process; hence the name stochastic quantization.

In June 2002, the EN Gottardo was replaced by a new leg of the EN Roma, running from Zurich and Basel, via Spiez and Brig, to Rome.Thomas Cook European Timetable (May 2002 edition), pp. 3, 276‚Äì277, 576‚Äì579. A previously operating version of the EN Roma joined this new leg in Brig. Trainsets RAe TEE II trainset in operation as the TEE Gottardo in 1988 The electric multiple unit (EMU) trainsets that were used by the Gottardo from 1961 to 1994, or most of its life, were very unusual in their ability to operate at four different overhead line voltages. The RAe TEE II trainsets were built in 1961 and designed specifically for use on international TEE routes that served countries whose national rail systems used different overhead voltages. On the TEE routes Edelweiss and Iris, the RAe trainsets needed all four different power settings; those routes travelled through five different countries. The route served by the Gottardo and Ticino served only two countries, but they have different line voltages. The multi- voltage RAe-TEE-type EMUs allowed the two Trans Europ Express trains to cross the Swiss-Italian border at Chiasso without having to stop. All other trains serving the line had to stop at the border station to enable the Swiss locomotive to be replaced by an Italian one, or vice versa, because of the difference in line voltage. After the Ticino was discontinued (in 1971), the Gottardo was the only scheduled passenger train on the Lugano‚ÄìComo line that did not have to stop at the border station, Chiasso. Border control officers carried out passport inspections on board the moving trains.
