Its maximum apparent visual magnitude is 6.5, placing it at the limit of the visibility to the naked eye. The brightness, however, drops down to 6.66 with a periodic cycle of roughly 7.44 hours. The stellar classification of this star is B4Ven, so it is a main sequence star that shows emission lines and broadened absorption lines induced by the fast projected rotational velocity of 300 km/s (the angle between the rotation axis and our line of sight has been estimated with a value of 72¬∞). This leads to the classification of the star as a Be star. Further proof is the compatibility between the rotational and luminosity variability periods. LQ Andromedae is also a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 7.413 days. Not much is known about the secondary component, but it is likely a low-mass companion (M<0.5 ).

It became the Pennsylvania Transportation Company in 1872 upon merger with Commonwealth Oil & Pipe Company. The company gathered crude oil from the oil fields in Northwest Pennsylvania and transported it via pipelines to railheads. It was the largest such company in the oil regions during this time, and was operated under the administration of Henry Harley. By 1871, it controlled 500 miles of pipelines in Northwest Pennsylvania. State charter A charter from the State of Pennsylvania in 1864 gave the company a unique right to carry oil via pipelines to railroad yards. Jay Gould's involvement In 1868, Jay Gould bought control of the company for $250,000 in an effort to gain increased rail traffic over the Erie Railroad via the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad. The Erie Railroad was competing for traffic with the New York Central Railroad via the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and with the Pennsylvania Railroad. In a contract signed on June 4, 1868, John D. Rockefeller's firm (Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler) along with Cleveland's other two largest oil refiners - Clark, Payne & Company; and Westlake, Hutchins & Company - were given a 25% of the interest in the Allegheny Transportation Company in return for $1. This stock was worth $62,222. On July 2, 1868, Jay Gould took control of the Erie Railroad. Gould's gift would help finance Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler through the next two lean years.

Their home in Tuxedo was known as Mortemar, a \\"turreted four-story mansion.\\" Construction on Mortemar, which was designed by Richard Howland Hunt of Hunt & Hunt, began in the 1890s and continued for 10 years, getting larger and larger. Personal life On April 26, 1886, Mortimer was married to Eleanor Jay Chapman (1864‚Äì1929), a direct descendant of John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States. Eleanor was the sister of John Jay Chapman (husband to Elizabeth Astor Winthrop Chanler), and the daughter of Eleanor (n√©e Jay) Chapman (daughter of John Jay, the U.S. Minister to Austria-Hungary under Grant) and Henry Grafton Chapman Jr. (son of abolitionist Maria Weston Chapman), the president of the New York Stock Exchange.

It is based on the best selling PlayStation franchise Uncharted by Naughty Dog. It was released on YouTube on July 16, 2018, and stars Nathan Fillion, Stephen Lang, Geno Segers, Mircea Monroe, and Ernie Reyes Jr.  Cast  * Nathan Fillion as Nathan Drake * Stephen Lang as Victor Sullivan * Geno Segers as Diego * Mircea Monroe as Elena Fisher * Ernie Reyes Jr. as El Tigre Synopsis Based on the best selling video game, treasure hunter Nathan Drake (Nathan Fillion) finds himself captured while searching for the lost treasure of the Flor de la Mar.  Production  Ungar and Fillion were introduced to one another by a mutual friend in January 2018 after Ungar expressed interest in speaking to Fillion about the project. Principal photography on the film began May 7, 2018 in Los Angeles, California and lasted for five days. The opening scenes were shot in Palmdale, California and the exteriors of the mansion were shot in Santa Clarita. The interiors were shot in Beverly Hills while the final scene was shot in Malibu, California. Fillion trained for the role and also performed most of his own stunts. According to Fillion and Ungar, most of the crew did not know what it was they were working on until Fillion showed up in wardrobe, as the production was set up under the fake title 'Breaking and Entering' which is a reference to a chapter in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.  Release  Nathan Fillion released the film through Twitter, Instagram and YouTube after dropping some teases on his social media. It reached over 2 million views in its first two days. Since its release, fans have taken to social media campaigning for Netflix or YouTube Premium to turn it into a digital series. Reception Critical reception for Uncharted has been positive with journalists, fans, and bloggers praising Fillion's performance as well as Ungar's direction. The Verge called it \\"film's only good video game adaptation\\" while Kotaku labelled it as \\"just about everything you‚Äôd want from an Uncharted movie: witty quips, fun twists, esoteric history references, and even a pivot to Video Game Mode for a gun fight.\\" Phil Hornshaw of The Wrap said \\"Ungar‚Äôs fan film pretty perfectly captures the feel of the game series, which has always carried the feel of a big-budget summer blockbuster movie. Fillion is a good fit for the role of the wise-cracking and amiable Drake; Stephen Lang (‚ÄúAvatar,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon't Breathe‚Äù) takes on the role of Sully in the fan film, and Mircea Monroe (‚ÄúEpisodes‚Äù) plays Elena. The script is dead-on ‚ÄúUncharted,‚Äù cutting from Nate firing off a bunch of jokes to a quick history lesson about 16th century conqueror Afonso de Albuquerque and explorer Ferdinand Magellan.\\" Buzzfeed was one of the many outlets that advocated for the short to turn into something more.

Of all NZCT projects, it is the technically most difficult one to ride and is rated \\"advanced\\" (Grade 4 out of 5). The highest point of the trail is at . History 19th century tracks During the West Coast Gold Rush in the early 1860s, the town of Lyell on the Buller River was founded. A dray road was built at the time towards the Lyell Saddle to give access to several mines and gold towns. There was also a dray road that started south of Seddonville and went along the M≈çkihinui River; the first land access to Karamea was via this route. In 1886, a survey was carried out to connect these two routes. Over time, knowledge of how much of the route had been built has been lost and the slips and landslides caused by the 1929 Murchison earthquake made those parts that had been built inaccessible. The 1968 Inangahua earthquake caused further damage. Rough & Tumble lodge and the M≈çkihinui dam M≈çkihinui catchment at the Rough & Tumble lodge In 2002, Marion Boatwright from North Carolina and his wife Susan Cook from Christchurch came across overgrown farmland at the end of the M≈çkihinui Gorge that they thought suitable for a lodge. They purchased the land and built the lodge themselves; it opened in December 2006. A local artist was asked to paint a mural of the M≈çkihinui above the lodge's fireplace. The artist's partner, Steve Stack, a local West Coaster with an intimate knowledge of the back-country, subsequently became friends with Boatwright. Before the lodge opened, Boatwright and Cook learned that Meridian Energy was working on a proposal to dam the M≈çkihinui River. Whilst the dam was to go immediately upstream of their property, their land was needed for three years for construction activity and they would have to move away during that time. Track exploration Steve Stack in 2018 Boatwright and his wife learned from the local Department of Conservation (DoC) manager, Bob Dickson, that a proposed tramping route along the M≈çkihinui Gorge was part of a longer dray road that had never been completed. Shortly after in early 2007, Boatwright was handed the original of an 1886 survey plan for a \\"Lyell and Mokihinui Road\\"; the owner of the map had been told that the Rough & Tumble lodge is an appropriate place for preserving local historic artefacts. The map showed the proposed alignment that Dickson had mentioned; it followed the M≈çkihinui River, then its south branch before climbing over the Lyell Range to stay above Lyell Creek to the site of Lyell township. In July 2007, Boatwright and Stack set out to tramp the route from Lyell to the Rough & Tumble lodge. Their objectives were to find out how much of the road had been built, how accessible it was, and whether it offered an attractive environment for tramping. They found that the track from Lyell stopped at Lyell Saddle and that nothing had ever been built along the south branch of the M≈çkihinui. The area downstream from Mountain Creek was known to Stack and the track started again several kilometres downstream from M≈çkihinui Forks. Their six-day tramp confirmed that over half of the surveyed road had never been built. And most of the part that had been built along the M≈çkihinui River was threatened to be flooded by the Meridian Energy dam proposal. Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust Boatwright set about to form a working group to progress the idea of a long-distance track. The environmental manager for the Solid Energy's Stockton coal mine, Phil Rossiter, joined first. Rossiter was a keen mountain biker and played rugby, and his employer was looking for opportunities to \\"give back to the community\\". The next to join was Wayne Pratt who had been intimately involved in creating the Hump Ridge Track; Pratt had recently purchased Helicharter Karamea and could provide helicopter access. When Dickson, the DoC manager, supported that a track be investigated, the group formed the Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust (MLBT) and had it incorporated in July 2008. Meridian Energy paid for the establishment costs and agreed in consultation with the group that should their dam proposal go ahead, they would establish a track above the new water level as a compensation measure. The trust embarked on getting a cost estimate and with financial help from Meridian Energy, a DoC field work specialist‚ÄîMal Hansen‚Äîwas flown into the south branch. Hansen, Stack and Boatwright explored the surveyed route from where Slate Creek flowed into the M≈çkihinui to Lyell Saddle and concluded that the route would have been difficult in the 1880s but had become untenable through the two 20th century earthquakes. They then explored in a downstream direction and stopped counting at 35 required bridges and flew out from Silver Creek, less than downstream (as the crow flies) from the confluence with Slate Creek. Based on this incomplete survey, a DoC staff member estimated the trail costs at NZ$7.3m. The trust then engaged an outdoor recreation specialist‚ÄîKay Booth‚Äîwith forecasting potential user numbers, and an economist‚ÄîGeoff Butcher‚Äîwith estimating the economic benefits for the local community. Booth was optimistic about the project but Butcher was sceptical. Lyell track Towards the end of 2008, the trust made the decision to drop any further exploration work along the M≈çkihinui River due to the uncertainty caused by Meridian Energy's dam proposal, but also because the trust had fallen out of favour with some groups due to its close working relationship with Meridian Energy. Instead, they proposed to DoC's Dickson that they concentrate on clearing the existing dray road from Lyell up to the first slip. Dickson suggested that they clear a helicopter landing area at the saddle for safer access from above but also large enough for a hut to be built there. Prior to this, the helicopter could only set down one skid at a rock outcrop, with members having to leave the craft \\"commando-style\\". 18 January 2009 saw the clearing of an area at the Lyell Saddle; this was the start of construction for the Old Ghost Road. After a few weekends of volunteers chainsawing fallen trees, the route became walkable. By winter 2009, Dickson proposed to hire two diggers to remove slips from the track. When the digger operators had been recruited the project suffered a significant setback, with a once-in-75-year rainstorm event having swept thousands of trees and many tons of debris onto the track. Over a five-week period, the track was restored. With the constant gradient of the track restored and having become obvious again, Rossiter proposed to the trust a change of scope from a tramping route to a mountain biking track; this was accepted. This left the challenge on the Lyell track to overcome ‚Äì two large slips that left near-vertical rock faces behind. Rossiter, a geologist by training, explained that the crumbly nature of this particular rock would respond best to chipping and prising away rather than explosives. A camp-site was built on the track that could sleep 14 volunteers and over several weekends, the crew hand-benched a track across the slips. New Zealand Cycle Trail funding John Dunn, project manager for the New Zealand Cycle Trail In late 2009, the trust heard that the New Zealand Cycle Trail (NZCT) project had $50m funding available for projects. Dickson cautioned that, based on what DoC knew about the project, the trust would have a \\"snowball's chance in hell\\" to receive any grants. Undeterred, Boatwright went to a workshop help by the NZCT team in Christchurch and he was the odd one out. Of the circa 30 attendees, all others were representing district or city councils developing projects to suit the available funding. Boatwright represented the only group of volunteers and they were the only ones already working on an actual project. In the first instance, NZCT wanted applicants to tell the story of their project, how much money they requested, and where the necessary co-funding would come from. Boatwright wrote the application and the trustees settled on asking for $2m. John Dunn, the NZCT project manager, informed Boatwright that of the 18 proposals that had been accepted, the Old Ghost Road was the top ranked one. The next step was to produce a feasibility study and Stack was sent along the south branch to find a track alignment that would be viable and feasible. The plan was to meet the other trustees at the Lyell Saddle helipad a week later and when he emerged, his face said it all: the south branch of the M≈çkihinui River could not fulfil the dream. Pratt, the helicopter pilot, spontaneously invited the others to a flight along the Lyell Range; he had often wondered whether one could go along the tops rather than following the river. And on that flight, the eventual route would be agreed on ‚Äì from the Lyell Saddle to Goat Creek Hut where the track would rejoin the M≈çkihinui River's south branch. It looked perfect, but the challenges of building it would nearly break the trustees in years to come. A week later, Stack and Boatwright walked south from Goat Creek Hut to meet Rossiter and a geologist‚ÄîBrian Adams‚Äîwho set out from Bald Hill above the Lyell Saddle to meet in the middle. The route looked feasible and when Dickson and his superior did a flyover, support from DoC was also given. Everybody agreed that the new route was a game changer, with the challenge of building the route through an alpine environment being intense. The resulting feasibility study produced by Adams was accepted by the NZCT. The third hurdle was to have agreed co-funding in place and in May 2010, all partners committed to their share. Development West Coast (DWC), a charitable trust set up by the government in 2001 with a fund of $92 million for the West Coast to stop native logging, would commit their funding. Solid Energy would fund the back- country huts. The Department of Conservation took on the ongoing maintenance of the Lyell-part of the track. Buller District Council took on maintenance support for the alpine sections and the track along the south branch. In addition, the New Zealand Cycle Trail team accepted that the M≈çkihinui Gorge section would be left unresolved until the Meridian Energy proposal for a dam had been resolved. Subsequently, Rossiter's wife Di took on the task of applying for grants and secured funding for 15 of the 17 bridges that had to be built. Bald Hill The trustees agreed to split tasks: Rossiter would deal with administrative work, negotiate with partners, and write the DoC environmental impact report. Stack would become a paid full-time employee of the trust and lead the crew of track workers. Boatwright would be in charge of the team that built huts that could give track workers accommodation. In addition, the chairmanship of the trust moved from Boatwright to Rossiter as the initial chair was to permanently relocate back to North Carolina. Boatwright would come back to the West Coast for a few weeks at a time whenever a hut needed to be built. Stack led a crew to build and restore the remaining Lyell track above the slips. Boatwright, on a stint back from the United States during March and April 2011, led the building of the Lyell Saddle Hut. The hut was only just ready when the crew finished the track from below. With the new base established, Stack and his crew tackled the six kilometres of track up Bald Hill. The geology changed from greywacke to mudstone at the Lyell Saddle and construction became difficult as the weight of the digger would turn the mudstone into mud, making track building impossible. The solution was to employ the corduroy road construction method with beech trees chainsawed lengthwise to produce the needed logs. One team member was assigned to chainsawing and after a while, he managed to produce enough material for of track per day. It was a hard slog and Stack's team spent over a year building the track up to the tops. Further huts Later in 2011, Boatwright built the Stern Valley Hut with the help of his brother and a builder friend. In January 2012, Boatwright built Ghost Lake Hut with two friends over 19 days. The hut sits at just over elevation on top of a vertical cliff. On 22 May 2012, Meridian Energy announced that they had cancelled the Mokihinui Hydro proposal. The trust responded by moving crews from the high country into the M≈çkihinui Gorge and Boatwright mobilised himself and three friends to build Specimen Point Hut as a winter base for the track builders. Etymology In late 2007, Boatwright thought about a name for the track and notioned the Lyell and Mokihinui Road as a ghost of a road; from this came the idea of \\"Ghost Road\\". Discussing the potential name with other trust members, Richard Little suggested that it be preceded by the word 'old' to become the \\"Old Ghost Road\\".

It includes a cemetery, constructed in the Neoclassical parallel to the nave of the church. The interior of the church has an extensive set of azulejo tiles in the rococo style. The historian Carlos Ott dated them to the late 18th century, and stated that they appear to be the work of the Juncal workshop in Portugal. The stonework of the church is in lioz stone, imported from Lisbon at great expense. The art historian Germain Bazin describes the church as a \\"refinement of forms\\", due to its long, narrow nave and lack of corridors in the nave. The church closed in 1994 after heavy rains caused the collapse of a wall of the church; additionally, the cemetery was used by residents for waste disposal. A restoration project began in 2011, which included the removal of 2,500 tons of garbage from the cemetery. The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar reopened in 2015. Location View of nave and chancel. The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar is located in the Com√©rcio district, in the historic lower city (cidade baixa) of Salvador. It was constructed at the base of a large slope below the Carmo district of the higher city. Its location at the base of the slope, which is largely unstabilized, has continually put the church at risk of damage caused by landslides. History The Brotherhood of Our Lady of Pilar (Irmandade do Pilar) was established in Salvador in 1718. Construction of its church began in 1756 on an undeveloped slope of land beyond the lower city, or cidade baixa, or Salvador. The cemetery was completed in 1799 on a higher level of terrain than the church building in the Neoclassical style. The church, its internal patio with a fountain, and cemetery at a higher level formed an architectural complex unique to the city of Salvador. Salvador was geographically divided into ten parishes, or freguesias, in the 19th century, uniting the functions of the state and church. The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar became the focal point of the freguesia of Sant√≠ssimo Sacramento do Pilar; residents were baptized, married, elected local officials, and were buried at the church. Pilar, as one of the commercial areas of the lower city, was home to both wealthy Portuguese merchants and enslaved and freed Afro- Brazilians; the latter worked in domestic labor, as fisherman, and as street vendors. A fire occurred in December of 1829 that damaged the dressing room (camirim) of the chancel and a tribune of the church. It also damaged many sculptures of saints, including the Lord of the Good Way (Senhor do Bom Caminho) and the statue of Our Lady of Pilar, the patron saint of the church. The fire also damage or completely melted sacred treasures of the church, including lamps, silver candlesticks, and the tabernacle. These were the work of Joaquim Alberto da Concei√ß√£o e Matos. A landslide off the slope occurred on July 9, 1843. The consistory of the church was built above the cemetery, and was carried away in the landslide killing Father Jo√£o Nepomuceno Moreira de Pinho, resident of the consistory. Structure View of cemetery. The fa√ßade of Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar, other than its monumental pediment, doors, and windows, are in lioz limestone imported from Lisbon. The monument pediment in the Rococo style was added later. The church interior consists of a nave, altar, sacristy, tribunes that open to the inner courtyard rather than the interior, a former sacristy, and other smaller rooms. The art historian Germain Bazin describes the church structure as a \\"rare\\" design in Bahia: it lacks corridors with the nave, has only two narrow corridors that lead to the sacristy, and results in a \\"refinement of forms\\"; church design of this kind in the previous century is found first in Braga in Portugal and then in Minas Gerais in Brazil. The painting on the ceiling of the nave is the work of Jos√© Te√≥filo de Jesus, completed in 1837. The master woodcarver Joaquim Francisco de Matos completed talha work on four altars of the nave, six tribunes, two pulpits, the carvings of the choir, and carvings of the baptismal font. The works were contracted in 1838 and completed in the following year; they were ultimately gilded in 1848. The church is home to numerous works of art, including statues, painting, and metalwork. The statue of the Lord of the Good Way (Senhor do Bom Caminho) is the work of Manuel In√°cio da Costa. Sacristy The sacristy of the Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar is richly furnished and decorated. A large sacristy cabinet spans the length of the north wall of the room. Six richly painted panels are above the cabinet; they are the work of Jos√© Joaquim da Rocha (1737-1807) and completed in 1796. An ornate stone lavabo is on the south wall. The sacristy has azulejo tiles similar to those of the nave and halls. Fountain A fountain dedicated to Saint Lucia is located in the interior churchyard at the base of the slope. The fountain is believed to have healing powers, especially for ocular problems. An annual festival dedicated to Saint Lucia takes place in September, and includes a Mass followed by a procession of the image of Saint Lucia throughout the Comercio district. Cemetery The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar was the first Catholic church in Salvador to build an annexed cemetery. The large Neoclassical structure, designed by Jos√© de Anchieta Mesquita, was constructed in 1799. An exterior cemetery was an innovation of the period; burials within the church proper caused both sanitary problems and the spread of infectious diseases to parishioners. Other churches in Salvador followed the practice of the construction of an external cemetery in the 19th century. Residents on the slope between the church and the upper Carmo district used the cemetery for waste disposal as early as the 19th century. The quantity of garbage caused the collapse of interior walls of the cemetery and cut off access to graves by the 20th century. The restoration project of 2011 saw the removal of 2,500 tons of garbage from the cemetery and restored access to the tombs and interior altar. Protected status The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1938. The church is part of the Historic Center of Salvador UNESCO World Heritage Site. Access The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar is open to the public and may be visited.

The statue was unveiled in 1955, celebrating Christopher Columbus's voyages to the New World. It was removed in July 2020, in light of the explorer's abusive relationship with indigenous Americans. Description Plaque formerly beneath the statue The statue rested on and was the central feature of the Portman Plaza on the south side of City Hall adjoining West Broad Street. The bronze alloy sculpture depicts Christopher Columbus wearing a cloak and holding a rolled document. The statue measures approximately 22 √ó 7.75 √ó 5.75 ft (6.7 √ó 2.36 √ó 1.75 m) and weighs approximately 3 tons. It rested on a square stone base that measures approximately 63 ft. A bronze plaque is infixed on the base. History Columbus City Hall's plaza by Broad Street Cast at the Micheluccio Foundry in Pistoia, Italy, the statue was a gift of the citizens of Genoa, Italy to the citizens of Columbus. It was transported from Italy to the United States aboard the Italian ocean liner SS Cristoforo Colombo. The statue was uncrated and erected in Columbus on October 10, 1955, and dedicated on October 12, 1955, during the city's Columbus Day celebration. As the statue was undergoing repair work in 1979, a time capsule in the form of a copper box was discovered. It contained, among other items, a railroad bill of lading for shipment of the statue. The statue was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" program in 1992. Removal Amid the controversial removal of Confederate monuments and memorials beginning in 2015, about 150 protesters rallied at the statue in August 2017. The protests aimed to have the statue removed, given Christopher Columbus's violence and enslavement of Native Americans. The 2020 George Floyd protests in Columbus renewed calls to remove the statue, with petitions circulating to also remove other statues of the explorer and to rename the city. The statue's removal was announced on June 18, with the mayor announcing plans for a work of art that better represents the people of Columbus. The statue had been vandalized one day prior, with the word \\"rapist\\" written across the statue's base. The Columbus Piave Club, representing the Italian- Americans who facilitated the statue's installation there, opposed the move, and called for it to either stay or be returned to them. The club stated it had celebrated the anniversary of its unveiling every year by the statue, since 1955. A city resident filed a lawsuit urging for a court order to stop the statue's removal, in hope that a decision is made by the Columbus City Council after a public hearing. The Columbus Art Commission, which oversees the city's public art, voted unanimously to approve the statue's removal on June 24. The statue was removed and stored on July 1, without a public hearing, as the mayor was able to order it. The art commission announced there will be public input into the work that replaces it, and who the artist will be.

The summit can also be reached by shorter but steeper paths from Howgill or Skyreholme, one mile north of the summit.  Name  There are several explanations of the origin of the name. It was first recorded in 1771, and may have been named after an owner of the estate in a similar way to the nearby crags named Lord's Seat and Earl Seat. A traveller in 1838 recorded a local tale that the crag was named after an infant found there by a shepherd, who named the child Simon.

Biography  Jannuzzi began his journalistic career at L'Espresso and in 1967, together with his colleague Eugenio Scalfari, published the investigation on the military secret services involved in the attempted coup known as Piano Solo. General Giovanni de Lorenzo, the mind behind the Piano Solo, sued both Jannuzzi and Scalfari: the two journalists managed to avoid prison thanks to the parliamentary immunity offered in 1968 by the Italian Socialist Party, with which Scalfari was elected to the Chamber of Deputies and Jannuzzi to the Senate. After this first political experience, Jannuzzi returned to journalism and in 1979 was one of the founders of Radio Radicale. From 2001 to 2008, Jannuzzi held once again a seat in the Senate, elected with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, who granted him parliamentary immunity from several judicial controversies he was involved in. He is currently a columnist for Panorama and for Il Giornale.  Judicial events  At the end of the 1990s, Jannuzzi was investigated for some articles in which he expressed numerous criticisms of the Neapolitan magistracy concerning the case of Enzo Tortora, considered as a victim of a very serious judicial error. In 2002, Jannuzzi was sentenced to two years, five months and ten days of imprisonment for press defamation, and in 2004 he was forced to serve his sentence, transformed into a home detention sentence. One year later, in 2005, President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi signed a provision of grace for Jannuzzi.  Journalistic campaigns against the judges of Palermo  On 19 October 1991, Jannuzzi accused judge Giovanni Falcone, who was trying to get the licenses to create a power of contrast against the Mafia associations, of being the main responsible for the inability of the country institutions to fight Cosa Nostra.  Journalistic campaigns against the judges of Milan  On 20 December 2001, Jannuzzi wrote on Panorama, after having written it on Il Giornale, that there was a plot against Silvio Berlusconi organised by several judges from Milan who, according to the words of Jannuzzi, tried to define strategies in order to arrest Berlusconi. Without any kind of evidence of the plot, Jannuzzi, Mondadori and the publishing house of Il Giornale were all sued, with the last two sentenced to a total reimbursement of 350,000 euros.

Its purpose is to detect statistical errors in peer-reviewed psychology articles by searching papers for statistical results, redoing the calculations described in each paper, and comparing the two values to see if they match. It takes advantage of the fact that psychological research papers tend to report their results in accordance with the guidelines published by the American Psychological Association (APA). This leads to several disadvantages: it can only detect results reported completely and in exact accordance with the APA's guidelines, and it cannot detect statistics that are only included in tables in the paper. Another limitation is that Statcheck cannot deal with statistical corrections to test statistics, like Greenhouse‚ÄìGeisser or Bonferroni corrections, which actually make tests more conservative. Some journals have begun piloting Statcheck as part of their peer review process. Validity In 2017, Statcheck's developers published a preprint paper concluding that the program accurately identified statistical errors over 95% of the time. This validity study comprised more than 1,000 hand-checked tests among which 5.00% turned out to be inconsistent. The study found that Statcheck recognized 60% of all statistical tests. A reanalysis of these data found that if the program flagged a test as inconsistent, it was correct in 60.4% of cases. Reversely, if a test was truly inconsistent, Statcheck flagged it in an estimated 51.8% of cases (this estimate included the undetected tests and assumed that they had the same rate of inconsistencies as the detected tests). Overall, Statcheck's accuracy was 95.9%, half a percentage point higher than the chance level of 95.4% expected when all tests are simply taken at face value. Statcheck was conservatively biased (by about one standard deviation) against flagging tests. More recent research has used Statcheck on papers published in Canadian psychology journals, finding similar rates of statistical reporting errors as the original authors based on a 30-year sample of such articles. The same study also found many typographical errors in online versions of relatively old papers, and that correcting for these reduced the estimated percent of tests that were erroneously reported. History Statcheck was first developed in 2015 by Michele Nuijten of Tilburg University and Sacha Epskamp of the University of Amsterdam. Later that year, Nuijten and her colleagues published a paper using Statcheck on over 30,000 psychology papers and reported that \\"half of all published psychology papers...contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test\\". The study was subsequently written up favorably in Nature. In 2016, Nuijten and Epskamp both received the Leamer-Rosenthal Prize for Open Social Science from the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences for creating Statcheck. In 2016, Tilburg University researcher Chris Hartgerink used Statcheck to scan over 50,000 psychology papers and posted the results to PubPeer; he subsequently published the data he extracted from these papers in an article in the journal Data. Hartgerink told Motherboard that \\"We're checking how reliable is the actual science being presented by science\\". He also told Vox that he intended to use Statcheck to perform a function similar to a spell checker software program. Hartgerink's action also sent email alerts to every researcher who had authored or co-authored a paper that it had flagged. These flaggings, and their posting on a public forum, proved controversial, prompting the German Psychological Society to issue a statement condemning this use of Statcheck. Psychologist Dorothy V.M. Bishop, who had two of her own papers flagged by Statcheck, criticized the program for publicly flagging many papers (including one of her own) despite not having found any statistical errors in it. Other critics alleged that Statcheck had reported the presence of errors in papers that did not actually contain them, due to the tool's failure to correctly read statistics from certain papers. Journals that have begun piloting the use of Statcheck as part of their peer review process include Psychological Science, the Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality, and the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. The open access publisher PsychOpen has also used it on all papers accepted for publication in their journals since 2017.

Preference of sons can be explained by an attitude: a belief that boys have more value than girls; it can be defined as a gender bias as well. This phenomenon in China can be shown in gender sex ratio. Moreover, Chinese son preference can be connected to a variety of reasons. The majority of men are naturally superior to women in terms of physical strength. In the early stage of human evolution, greater physical strength means more sources of food and more survival opportunities in tribal warfare. Majority of investments shows that the financial support that parents receive after their child‚Äôs marriage is significantly affected by their child‚Äôs gender. This can be one of the reasons that Chinese parents are more willing to have a son. Furthermore, Chinese agrarian society influences sex preference deeply as well. It is obvious that agriculture needs physical strength in a primitive agricultural society. Thus, the long run agriculture society in China can explain this phenomenon. Although the Chinese patriarchal thinking can be traced back thousands of years, with the development of the Chinese economy, this concept potential gradually disintegrates.  History  The origin of Chinese son preference can be related to the beginning of Chinese patriarchic society. Agriculture can be a key to understand the Chinese son preference history. For thousands of years in China, most of the Chinese preferred sons rather than daughters because majority of males have more ability to earn more than girls, especially in agrarian economies. Clearly, when human society enters the patriarchal society from the matriarchal society, men gradually occupy a dominant position in social production. People cannot leave men in hunting, animal husbandry, plowing or even snoring. in most of the religious aspects, males can continue the family line; in financial factor, most of the Chinese older generation believe that girls typically have no responsibility for their parents when they marry. Clearly, the ethical thoughts of male superiority and female sorrow have existed in the patriarchal society. With the development of feudal ethics, this viewpoint has gradually developed and deepened into the hearts of the people.  Reasons   Agrarian society  The agrarian society is based on producing and maintaining crops and farmland. Agrarian society in China is one of the factors that impact Chinese son preference. Before the globalisation, during Song, Ming and Qing dynasty, China has trapped in an agrarian society period. Obviously, the majority of works in agriculture must utilize males‚Äô strength. Although the expansionary of urbanisation has increased in recent decades in China, agriculture still has impact on gender bias in this country. The Chinese social culture cannot be changed easily. Despite the fact that China has developed its economics rapidly, majority of farmers who move from rural area to urban city still hold the son preference value; in Chinese social culture, sons should take more responsibility to take on households.  Financial security  Financial security is a reason that affects sex preference in China. In Chinese social culture, in older generation concepts, once a girl is married with her husband, she will belong to the husbands family, which means she will not have the responsibility to take care of her parents anymore; thus, their parents will have worried who can take care of them if their daughter got married. In general, the majority of traditional Chinese societies culture concept believes that sons can take responsibility for their family, instead of girls. In other words, traditionally, the blood of the family has been inherited by the male side. After the woman married, she joined her husbands family and took care of her in-laws rather than her parents. For a long period of time, \\"nurturing children to prevent old age\\" is the iron law of people's trust. In contrast, from several Chinese opinions, raising a daughter becomes a waste. Some Chinese Sociologists even point out from the perspective of society, it is not rational to be patriarchal, but for individuals, this is still a wise choice. In recent years, Chinese population became larger. Therefore, Chinese government advanced the ‚Äòone child policy‚Äô in order to dominate the large population in 1979. With the developing technology, Chinese parents may know their childs sex, they potentially use the sex-selection abortion to make sure they have boys. In Chinese older generations opinions, they potentially will get financial support even if their sons are getting married.  Traditional Chinese folk religion  Confucius 02Son preference in rural China has some affect by traditional Chinese folk religion. Such folk religion may overlap with an individual's belief in Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, or other traditional Chinese religions. It is widely known that the majority of Chinese hold Confucianism as their core value religion in ancient China; patriarchy is a part of value included by Confucianism. In general, the preference of son basically is strongly command in country which holds Confucianism. Confucianism brings heaved burden on Chinese women. In Chinese traditional confusion families, husband and other family members have more statues than wives. Chinese wives paramount responsibility is to look after and serve the household, including to do all the housework. Furthermore, the ancestor worship underlined by the Chinese folk religion as well. Besides, Chinese ancestor worship emphasizes the filial piety. One of the filial method is to continue the family line in China. Passing on the genealogy is one of the method to continue the family. However, in Chinese old generation concepts, family‚Äôs genealogy will be interrupted if they don‚Äôt have sons. Moreover, the inability to bear a son can become a potential factor for divorce a some couples.  Consequences  The sex ratio of birth(SRB) is defined as the ratio of the new born male infants to every 100 girls. It is demonstrated that China has always reported high SRBs during the past decades because of the effect of preference to sons, and there would possibly be a lack of women in the whole society of China for next 20 years, as a shortage of women was estimated to be faced. Interestingly, people in China who are unable to be married or single for a long time are generally called 'guang gun (single)', meaning 'bare branches'. According to the reality of male excess female, majority of consequences can be assumed. Firstly, the sexual frustration and psychosocial vulnerability may come together to these males and let them become violent and aggressive. To be clear, the reason is that they can‚Äôt through achieve marriage and bear a child to meet the Chinese traditional expectations. Although it just a consumption, this prediction has a good empirical to support: the cross-culture evidences illustrate that majority of criminal planner and murderers were low status and unmarried males. They may turn to anti-social organizations, threatening social stability and security, since they do not behave in current social order. Therefore, male surplus is a trepidation issues which should be concerned. Nevertheless, the evidence is not strong enough to proof the prediction that they are prone on crime though majority of the unmated males are easy to tend to become depression. Furthermore, excess male has stimulate the phonograph industry as well. Majority of data illustrate that the sex industry is experiencing expansionary in current decades. However, the consequence of increasing the sex workers as increasing sex ratio can‚Äôt be proved. According to some research, the main reason for increasing the sex workers in China can be related to Chinese domestic socioeconomic inequality. Some positive consequence may affect since high sex ratio on marriage of males in China. Basically, the women status will develop gradually. Clearly, the sex preference may rise the Fertility needs. The mortality rate of girls will decrease as gender discrimination decreases. Minority of article argues that sex imbalance is a way to control Chinese large population. Furthermore, with the decreasing number of women in society, their value will be increased. Thus, their status increases as well. Developing the woman status may let son preference decreased potentially. The issue of women‚Äôs rights and patriarchal issues has also become a major concern of the representatives of the Chinese National Committees in 2017. In recent years, the Chinese government has always attached great importance to the rights and interests of women, especially the series of targeted measures taken in recent years to significantly improve the status of women.  Chinese one child policy  It is worth mentioning that Chinese one child policy contribute to sex imbalance in China as well. One child policy is a kind of family planned policy, which means one family just can have one child, and family will get the financial penalty if they violate the policy. To be clear, one child policy implemented by Chinese central government from late 1970s to 2016. The original intention of this policy was to control the growth rate of Chinese large population. Although this policy was introduced as a long term and temporary policy and aim to reduce the number of family members, this measure was not uniform to some extent. In the early 1980s, the sex ratio of births was 108 (the ratio of male to female was 108:100), slightly higher than the natural level; by 2000, this number had soared to 120, even in provinces such as Anhui, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi. Reached 130. As a result, more than 35 million female populations ‚Äúevaporate‚Äù from society. Although China is not the only country that is affected by high population-specific ratios, Chinese problems are the most serious; and the one child policy is even worse. The government reinforced the idea that boys are more valuable than girls through provide the extra compensation for family who have only one daughter. Clearly, in some rural area in China, it was allowed to have a second child when their first child is a girl. Therefore, from this perspective, Chinese government seems to default the trend of son preference at that time. In other words, the implementation of this policy has become unbalanced, the most efficiency in the urban area and the weakest in the remote area in China. In addition, when this measure is implemented, economic sanctions will be imposed on those who violate the law, and some employment benefits will be provided to those who comply with the regulations. Nevertheless, although the result of this policy achieved the desire effect, the Chinese overall rate of natural increase declined. Overall, the biggest impact of the one-child policy on the child's gender is not the first child born, but the second child, and this is the most important reason for the gender imbalance in Chinese population. Because, if a family is allowed to have two children, majority of families will choose to let the first child be born naturally (both men and women), but when they have a second child, they will consider the issue of gender selection.  See also  The United Nations proposes improvements in gender equality in China. Son preference in China has also attracted social or international attentions. The gender imbalance in Chinese-born babies is a problem that has plagued China in recent years and has been a concern of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. In the conclusion, the Commission made some constructive suggestions. The Committee recommends that China conduct compulsory gender equality education for family planning officials and recommend that China address the tendency to be patriarchal in rural areas and address the root causes of patriarchal attitudes in rural areas. To solve the negative consequences of the one-child policy, the specific recommendations of this committee is to expand the benefit of public in rural areas, especially rural women, by expanding the insurance system and pensions in China. 57In addition, with efforts of various government departments in China, nowadays, more and more people can treat boys and girls equally.

Zarpas was a Greek owned transport company that operated in Lagos during the colonial period. The firm was founded by John Nicholas Zarpas in 1929 and it dominated public transportation within the metropolis from 1933 to 1958. Zarpas operations began as a bus service between Lagos Island and the new Yaba Estate via Ebute Metta. The firm's owner started the route with purchase of Dennis buses. However, the service initially was not profitable, Zarpas then added additional bus stops to increase traffic. The completion of Carter Bridge in 1931 and increased movement to the mainland improved traffic and Zarpas' fortunes. The firm charged a penny for its premier service and by 1933 it was generating profit and expanding with a staff of 75 people. The firm added Albion trucks to its fleet and added the Lagos to Apapa route. Though it was not the first bus services initiated in Nigeria, Charlotte Obasa, daughter of Richard Blaize had earlier ran a non-profit oriented service after the Lagos tram closed. Zarpas service created the nucleus of a regular public transportation in Lagos. In 1933, more companies bidded to operate bus services from Lagos Island to Ebute Metta. By 1940, commuter traffic was on the increase, Zarpas' inability to source for new vehicles as a result of the war led to over-crowded buses especially during peak hours. Zarpas secured Lagos Town Council's permission to increase the number of standing passengers. In 1958, after accusations of favoritism and monopolistic tendencies, Zarpas Services was acquired by the Lagos Town Council and re-organized as the Lagos Municipal Transport Service which later became Lagos State Transport Corporation (LSTC). However, LSTC buses were considered slow by the public who were now used to 'molue' and 'danfo' buses that did not waste time at each bus stop.

Early life Newbold was born on May 19, 1849. He was the son of Thomas Haines Newbold (1815‚Äì1869) and Mary Elizabeth (n√©e Rhinelander) Newbold (1822‚Äì1897). Among his siblings was Catherine Augusta Newbold, Frederick Rhinelander Newbold (who served as President of the American Rose Society), and Edith Newbold. His paternal grandparents were Philadelphia born Thomas Newbold and Catherine (n√©e LeRoy) Newbold, who died in Paris, France in 1835. His maternal grandparents were Frederick William Rhinelander and Mary Lucretia Ann (n√©e Stevens) Rhinelander (daughter of Maj. Gen. Ebenezer Stevens). His uncle was Frederic W. Rhinelander, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and his maternal aunt was Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander, the mother of Frederic Rhinelander Jones and Edith Newbold Jones, his first cousin who was a novelist and designer better known as Edith Wharton. Career Newbold was educated at schools in Poughkeepsie (including the Fen Stanton Vicarage) and Trinity Hall, University of Cambridge, receiving a B.A. degree in 1871. He then became a lawyer, studying in the office of Sanford, Robinson & Woodruff, eventually graduating from Columbia Law School in 1874. In 1883, he was elected on an \\"anti-bribery platform\\" to serve as a Democratic State Senator in the 107th and 108th New York State Legislatures, representing the 15th District, which included Columbia, Dutchess and Putnam counties. In 1885, he was selected by the Democrats of the 2nd District, Dutchess County, to represent them at the State Convention. While serving in the State Senate, he became close with then Governor of New York, Grover Cleveland, later the President of the United States. After retiring from the Senate, Newbold served as the President of the New York State Department of Health in the 1880s and 1890s, succeeding Erastus Brooks. Society life In 1892, Newbold and his wife Sarah were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Newbold was a member of the Knickerbocker Club, the Metropolitan Club, the Racquet and Tennis Club and the Church. In 1885, the Newbolds acquired property in Hyde Park, New York, known as Bellefield, adjacent to James Roosevelt's Springwood (both of which are now a part of the Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site). In 1912, the Newbolds hired Beatrix Farrand (the daughter of his cousin Frederic Rhinelander Jones and his wife, Mary Cadwalader Rawle Jones) to design a walled residential garden at Bellefield. It is one of the earliest extant examples of Farrand's residential designs, and is one of the only known pairings of works by Farrand and the architects McKim, Mead & White, who remodeled the Newbolds' eighteenth-century house from 1909 to 1911 in the Colonial Revival style. Personal life East 79th Street. On June 2, 1880, Newbold was married to Sarah Lawrence Coolidge (1858‚Äì1922), a direct descendant of Thomas Jefferson. She was the daughter of T. Jefferson Coolidge, a Boston Brahmin businessman who served as the U.S. Minister to France under President Harrison, and Mehitable Sullivan \\"Hetty\\" (n√©e Appleton) Coolidge. Together, they were the parents of: * Mary Edith Newbold (1883‚Äì1969), who married William Gerald Dare Morgan (1879‚Äì1948), a descendant of the Livingston and Hoyt families (through Maturin Livingston), in 1916. Gerald, as he was known, was the brother of Geraldine Morgan Thompson. * Thomas Jefferson Newbold (1886‚Äì1939), who married Katherine Hubbard in 1914. * Julia Appleton Newbold (1891‚Äì1972), who married William Redmond Cross (1874‚Äì1940), a Governor of the Aero Club of America from 1911-1921 and president of the New York Zoological Society, in 1913. In 1916, he hired McKim, Mead & White to build a new residence for his family at 15 East 79th Street (which today is the Rudolf Steiner School). The architects tore down two identical brownstones and built an Italian Renaissance style palazzo with an arched double-door entrance. Newbold's wife died at their New York home on December 29, 1922. He died on November 11, 1929 in New York City. He was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. After his death, his estate was divided equally among his three children with his eldest daughter Mary inheriting their New York City residence and Bellefield in Hyde Park. Descendants Through his daughter Julia, he was the grandfather of Emily Redmond Cross (‚Äì2006), who married John Kenyon Vaughan-Morgan, a Member of Parliament for Reigate who was the son of the Sir Kenyon Vaughan-Morgan and the Lady Vaughan-Morgan of London, in March 1940.

Ltd. is a Chinese online-only insurance company. Founded in 2013, the company's headquarters are based in Shanghai, China. ZhongAn's chairman and executive director is Yaping Ou who is also an executive director. The company's CEO is Jin ‚ÄúJeffrey‚Äù Chen but was initially co-founded by China's most notable business magnates- the chairmen of Chinese multinational conglomerates. This includes Alibaba‚Äôs Jack Ma, Tencent's Pony Ma and Ping An Insurance's Mingzhe Ma. Together, the three businessmen created the country‚Äôs first and largest insurance company to offer and sell products through the internet. There are five important areas of service that the company offers and sells; lifestyle consumption, consumer finance, health, auto and travel. In addition to insurance services, ZhongAn has established numerous subsidiaries such as ZhongAn International and ZhongAn Information and Technology Services and Co. As of January 2019, ZhongAn has a total market capitalization of HK$38.5 billion.  Markets  The insurance technology company is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under the stock code ‚Äò6060:HK‚Äô. ZhongAn began floating on the stock exchange in September 2017 and raised US$1.5 billion on its opening day, at a valuation of US$11 billion. This made it the largest initial public offering in Hong Kong in 2017 and also the first insurance technology offering that Hong Kong had. ZhongAn's share prices increased by more than 9% on the opening day of their public trading to HK$65.20. Alvin Cheung Chi-Wai, an associate director at Prudential Brokerage in Hong Kong, said, ‚ÄúThe main reason is not ZhongAn displaying attractive quality but the three 'horses' backing it‚Äù ‚Äì in reference to the company's three original founders, as ‚ÄòMa‚Äô in Chinese translates to meaning ‚Äòhorse‚Äô. The day after its IPO, its share price declined by 2.7%. In China, the insurtech industry is expected to grow significantly from approximately US$37 billion in 2015 to US$174 billion in 2020. By the end of 2016, ZhongAn made up 0.9% of China's insurtech market and gained a competitive advantage by having a special digital insurance license before its competitors.  Products and services  Since ZhongAn's inception, it has up to 460 million users and has issued over 5.8 billion insurance policies. A significant proportion of its customer base (60%), are aged 20 to 35 and most consumers from this age group bought their first insurance policy through the company. ZhongAn offers a wide range of personalised products and services to its Chinese consumers.  Business  ZhongAn has a subsidiary called ZhongAn International, founded in December 2017.softbank-vision-fund-220207.shtml|title=China‚Äôs Online Insurer ZhongAn to Get Investment from SoftBank for Overseas Growth|date=August 21, 2018|website=PR Newswire|access-date=September 1, 2018}} In August 2018, ZhongAn created a second partnership with a Boston-based biotechnology company, Orig3n. ZhongAn Information and Technology Services and Co., or simply known as ZhongAn Technology, is also another subsidiary that was created in November 2016. ZhongAn Technology focuses on R&D; (research and development). The new subsidiary has four key areas of focus: artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, cloud computing and data driven analytics. In 2018, ZhongAn Technology announced a partnership agreement with Chinese insurance company, AXA Tianping. This partnership marked the launch of ZhongAn's SaaS platform (software-as-a-service) which aims to offer insurance companies with three key products; accessibility to medical records that come from medical institutions, online services that assist in providing compensation for insurance companies and risk management services. Furthermore, ZhongAn also aims to expand their businesses overseas in the Japanese market through their newly formed business partnership with Sompo Japan Nipponka. As a Japanese insurance company, Sompo Holdings is one of the largest property insurance companies in the Japanese market. This partnership will aim to create an insurance service that is entirely cloud-based. ZhongAn will provide an opportunity for the Japanese company to enhance its insurance services through technology and digitalisation. As such, Sompo Japan Nipponka will directly provide ZhongAn with an opportunity to enter the international market, specifically focusing on the Asian region. ZhongAn's entry into Japan is expected to have a significant impact as opposed to Japan's insurance startups such as JustInCase. This is because demand for digitised products in insurance have increased. Overall, both companies have high hopes that their synergy will digitally transform the insurance industry by offering new, innovative products in 2019.  Founders and key individuals  Yaping Ou is the current executive chairman of ZhongAn since its inception in 2013. He was previously the chairman and executive director of property development company, Sinolink Worldwide Holdings, Ltd from 1997 to 2013. He also came 62nd on Forbes‚Äô list of 400 richest Chinese individuals in 2005, with a net worth of US$273 million. Ou has worked in numerous investing and trading companies in both the China region and Hong Kong. ZhongAn's chairman appointed his son, Jinyu Ou, as a non-executive director to provide professional assistance to the Board. He is also part of the Investment Strategy Committee of ZhongAn. The CEO of ZhongAn is Jin ‚ÄúJeffrey‚Äù Chen who was previously a vice president in China Merchants Fund Management Co Ltd from 2003 to 2005 and also in China Merchants Securities from 2002 and 2003. The company, however, was originally co-founded by Jack Ma from Alibaba, Pony Ma from Tencent Holdings and Ma Mingzhe from Ping An Insurance Group. All three entrepreneurs are also the company's largest shareholders. It is a common belief that Hong Kong's retail investors don't have much knowledge in ZhongAn's company or its business and have only invested due to the three Ma's.

Such experiments will examine how microgravity affects the rodents, providing information relevant to human spaceflight, discoveries in basic biology, and knowledge that can help treat human disease on Earth. Background Based on the recommendations from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era (2011). The report included a recommendation that NASA establish a rodent research facility aboard the International Space Station designated as a national laboratory ‚Äúas soon as possible‚Äù to enable high-priority, long duration rodent studies. The goal was to conduct studies of durations up to 6 months. As mice and rats have life spans of at most 5 years the ‚Äústudies on these rodents in space have the potential to extrapolate important implications for humans living in space well beyond six months.\\" The Rodent Research Hardware System was developed by scientists and engineers at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California . In the past short- term rodent experiments transported to space on various vehicle including the Space Shuttle. This is the first \\"permanent\\" laboratory for rodent research. The system was developed based on what was learned from the Animal Enclosure Module that flew aboard 27 Space Shuttle missions between 1983 and 2011. The first Rodent Research Hardware System was delivered to the ISS by SpaceX CRS-4. Design The system has 4 major components. The Transporter is used to safely house the rodents while being transported from Earth to the space station. This is also referred to as the Animal Enclosure Module- Transporter(AEM-T). As the trip from Earth can take up to 10 days an Environmental Control and Life Support System(ECLSS) is required. This is provided by the Animal Enclosure Module-ECLSS(AEM-E). The Animal Access Unit provides containment while transferring of rodents between the Transporter and the Habitat; and the Habitat that provides long-term housing for rodents aboard the station. The Habitat component operate in an EXPRESS Rack facility aboard the station. Crew members will use the access module to examine the rodents closely during the study and to transfer them between habitats as needed. Each habitat module provides as many as 10 mice or six rats with all of the basics they need to live comfortably aboard the station including water, food, lighting and fresh air. Rodents easily can move around the living space by grasping grids that line the floor and walls. The modules include data downlink capability that enables monitoring of environmental conditions such as temperature. A visible light and infrared video system allows the crew in space and scientists and veterinarians on the ground to monitor behavior and overall health of the rodents on a daily basis. Missions Rodent Research-1 (RR1) Delivered on 21 September 2014 to the ISS by SpaceX CRS-4. Mission was a validation of the operational capabilities of the hardware to support rodent research provides valuable information applicable to future long-term space missions. Rodent Research-1 was a joint operation between NASA and CASIS. The experiments involved 20 mice; 10 NASA mice and 10 CASIS mice. This was the first time rodents were transported to the ISS aboard an uncrewed commercial vehicle. Lasting 37 days, Rodent Research-1 was the longest duration spaceflight rodent study to date conducted in a NASA facility.The Bone Densitometer was also delivered on this mission to be used in later missions. Rodent Research-2 (RR2) RR2 Patch Delivered on 14 April 2015 to the ISS by SpaceX CRS-6. The research was sponsored by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) and Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research. The primary objective of the research was to monitor the effects of the space environment on the musculoskeletal and neurological systems of mice as model organisms of human health and disease. In addition to the primary research focus other organ systems, including whole blood, brain, heart, lungs, kidney/adrenal glands, liver, spleen, and small intestines, were also studied for molecular and morphological changes as a function of duration of spaceflight exposure. The study included 40 mice, 20 that were flown to the ISS and 20 as controls that remained on Earth. The study lasted 37 days. The Bone Densitometer Validation experiment was used in support of RR-2. Rodent Research-3 (RR3) RR3 Patch Delivered on 8 April 2016 to the ISS by SpaceX CRS-8. The research was sponsored by the International Space Station U.S. National Laboratory in partnership with Eli Lilly and Company. The primary objective was to countermeasure against muscle atrophy. The study assessed myostatin inhibition to prevent skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness in mice. Twenty mice were flown for this experiment and the study lasted 33 days. As part of the study astronauts successfully completed a functional assessment of grip strength in mice on the orbiting laboratory. This was the first time a grip strength meter has been used for rodent research on orbit, and the data gathered will be used to assess the efficacy of the anti-myostatin treatments in preventing muscle loss in space. Rodent Research-4 (RR4) RR4 Patch Delivered on 19 February 2017 to the ISS by SpaceX CRS-10. The research was sponsored by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Space Test Program and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), manager of the ISS National Laboratory. The primary objective of the study was to better understand bone healing and bone tissue regeneration and to study the impacts of microgravity on these processes. The study also intended to gauge certain agents capable of inducing bone healing and regeneration in spaceflight. The study lasted 28 days. NASA studies in space involving mice require housing mice at densities higher than recommended in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. For this reason all previous NASA missions in which mice were co-housed, involved female mice. This spaceflight study examining bone healing, male mice are required for optimal experimentation. To ensure valid results from this first NASA study involving male mice an additional study on the housing density was done. The study included 80 mice, 40 that were flown to the ISS and 40 as controls that remained on Earth. Some of the results of this study have been published in the journal of Life Sciences in Space Research focusing on the impact of launch into space on bone fracture healing. Rodent Research-5 (RR5) RR5 Patch Delivered on 3 June 2017 to the ISS by SpaceX CRS-11. The research was sponsored by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) in partnership with the University of California at Los Angeles. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate a new strategy to mitigate one of the negative effects of living in space (bone degradation). All the mice were periodically injected with either a control treatment or an experimental treatment that contains NELL1, a protein that when expressed can help regulate bone-remodeling. The study is based on research on NELL1 done by a group lead by Dr. Chia Soo, a UCLA professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery and orthopedic surgery. The experiments involved 40 mice that were flown to the ISS. On 3 July 2017 twenty of the mice were returned to Earth live. This was the first time the Transporter unit was used to carry mice from the ISS back to Earth alive. The entire study lasted 30 days. Rodent Research-9 (RR9) RR9 Patch Delivered on 14 August 2017 to the ISS by SpaceX CRS-12. The research was sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Space Life and Physical Sciences program. This is the first Rodent Research mission that is dedicated to NASA-sponsored science experiments. Previous missions on the ISS involved commercial and other government agency experiments selected by the Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS). The mission consisted of three separate experiments led by principal investigators Michael Delp, Xiao Wen Mao, and Jeffrey Wiley. Delp's investigation was designed to study the effects of long duration spaceflight on fluid shifts and increased fluid pressures in the head, Mao's was to examine the impact of spaceflight on the vessels that supply blood to the eyes, and Wiley's was designed to study the extent of knee and hip joint degradation caused by prolonged exposure to weightlessness. The study lasted 33 days. Rodent Research-6 (RR6) RR6 Patch Delivered on 15 December 2017 to the ISS by SpaceX CRS-13. The research was sponsored by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) in partnership with Novartis and NanoMedical Systems. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate a novel therapeutic drug delivery chip in microgravity. The nanochannel drug delivery chip delivered the drug formoterol, used in the management of asthma and other medical conditions, to achieve a constant and reliable dosage. The experiments involved 40 mice that were flown to the ISS. On 13 January 2018 twenty of the mice were returned to Earth alive. The remaining 20 mice were studied for and additional 30 days. The study lasted 60 days. Rodent Research-7 (RR7) RR7 Patch Delivered on 29 June 2018 to the ISS by SpaceX CRS-15. The research was the second mission sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Space Life and Physical Sciences program. The primary objective of the study was to study the impact of the space environment on the gut microbiota of mice. The importance of this study is that disruption of the normal microbiota communities in the digestive tract has been linked to multiple health problems: including the intestinal, immune, mental, and metabolic health. The experiments involved 20 mice that were flown to the ISS. On 3 August 2018 ten of the mice were returned to Earth alive. The entire study lasted 77 days. Rodent Research-8 (RR8) Delivered on 8 December 2018 to the ISS by SpaceX CRS-16. Strangely it did not appear on the list of science payloads for the mission. The experiment was blamed for delaying the launch due to mold being discovered on the food for the mice.Moldy Mouse Chow Delays SpaceX Dragon Launch to Space Station The research is sponsored by the National Laboratory in partnership with Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) and Taconic Biosciences. The primary objective of the study is to study the physiology of aging and the effect of age on disease progression using groups of young and old mice. The study will consist of 2 groups of 20 mice each. Half of each group will be 10‚Äì16 weeks old (young group), the other half will be 30‚Äì52 weeks old (old group). Half of each group will be returned to Earth alive after about 30 days. The remaining mice will be euthanized and cryogenically preserved for study back on Earth. This is also been designated as Rodent Research Reference Mission-1 (RRR-1). For this mission the samples gathered will be made available for other researchers through a proposals submitted to CASIS. Rodent Research-10 (RR10) This mission is scheduled to fly to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-17. The research is sponsored by NASA Research Office - Space Life and Physical Sciences. The primary objective of the study is to examine the CDKN1a/p21 pathway and its role in the arresting bone regeneration in microgravity. The study consisted of 20 mice, 10 of are transgenic CDKN1a/p21-Null mice. The study was expected to last up to 35 days. Rodent Research-11 (RR11) This mission is scheduled to fly to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-17. The research was sponsored by NASA Research Office - Space Life and Physical Sciences. The primary objective of the study is to study how MicroRNA related to vascular health in microgravity. The study consisted of 20 mice to be flown to the ISS and 20 mice that remained on the ground as controls. After approximately 30 days, the 20 mice on the ISS will be returned alive.

The campus is known for its multiple statues and complex tiered design. The campus is approximately a 10-minute walk from the town centre. Buildings The campus is home to many \\"landmark\\" buildings, some of which were the result of architectural competitions.  Academic  The Duke of Kent building The academic buildings of the campus are all named for scholars, most of whom are associated with the university or the town of Guildford, like Lewis Carroll and Alan Turing. In the 1960s they were built as flexible \\"modules\\" or \\"shells\\" in order to be multi-purpose. The designers' visions were successful, as the interior of these buildings have been remodeled for different university needs. The design has also been attributed to utilitarian needs because of a lack of funding. In 1997, the Austin Pearce building (named for former Pro-Chancellor Austin Pearce) opened at an open piazza on the campus. This building boasts four lecture theatres and an open atrium containing sculptures like a suspended acrobat, created by local artist. In 2003, the Rik Medlik building, adjacent to the Austin Pearce building, was built. It opened the following year, along with the exterior space connecting them. This building is one of the most environmentally-friendly and sustainable structures in the UK, and its design includes a roof sensor to adjust lighting needs and a cooling unit that takes energy from daily stored waste heat. The Duke of Kent building, named for the university's Chancellor, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, was opened in 1999 and named in 2000 as \\"one of the top 100 buildings in the world\\". The design includes a large curved side with many windows, allowing the atrium to have plenty of natural light; the building materials of the rest of the structure also bring in light. There is a connected podium area that provides an outside open space. The stairs between the main building and the piazza are on a straight line with both the Students' Union and the Cathedral. The building was used as the filming location for the ARC in the TV series Primeval because of its appearance as both futuristic and like a traditional ship.  Residential  The duplex Stag Hill rooms on the campus, designed by Maguire and Murray, were award- winning. The Millennium House building was designed by Sir Nicholas Grimshaw and partners, who also designed the Duke of Kent building, and is also known as \\"The Train\\" because of its shape and because the railway line runs behind it. Its design is in harmony with that of the Duke of Kent building, which it faces.  Other  Other campus buildings include Senate House, which features a distinct clockface that was given to the university by Charterhouse School, the Lewis Elton Gallery, which is contained within two buildings of the campus and is responsible for the curation of art at the university, and the Multifaith Centre, which has places of worship for many world religions and was built in 2007. There is an on-campus nightclub called Rubix, which is popular among students (according to journalists from university magazine The Stag when interviewed by other publications). The nightclub has three bars and a layout that keeps clubgoers spread out, and has regular club nights on Wednesday and Friday, having hosted music acts from Stormzy to David Bowie to Led Zeppelin. Near to the club is a fast food shop called Pizzaman, which is open after club nights. The Students' Union on the campus is in Union House, a Brutalist landmark designed by Maguire and Murray in 1972. However, in 2017 it was described as \\"life expired\\". In 2016, the architecture firm HLM was hired to refurbish the Union House, but in 2017 a closed competition was opened by the university for proposals from selected firms (including HLM) to design a new ¬£10‚Äì12 million building for the union to be housed in. At the time, Union House contained multiple important student life facilities, like bars and lounges, as well as the students' union. It is home to the nightclub Rubix. The HLM refurbishment would have expanded and redesigned three floors of the existing building. The new proposal is planned for completion in 2020, with extensive spaces including the campus' largest lecture theatre, a multi- purpose performance venue, radio and TV stations for campus societies Stag Radio and StagTV, and a cinema. A university research building is the 5G Innovation building, the centre for all global development of 5th generation mobile networks. Another is the Surrey Space Centre, partnered with NASA. Also located on the campus are the main operating buildings for BBC Surrey & Sussex, and national academic examining body AQA. Former buildings on the campus include \\"Channies\\" and \\"Amigos\\". \\"Amigos\\" is a former name of the campus grocery shop, and \\"Channies\\" is the nickname of now-closed Chancellor's Bar.  Statues and art  The open piazza, with the Rik Medlik building behind The Surrey Stag The campus has many artistic and meaningful statues and murals. On the open piazza there are many artistic features, including an oversized statue of Alan Turing, an embedded fountain, and Knife Birds, an African-inspired piece. This piazza was unveiled in 2004. Statues by the university lake include All The Gang Are Here, a statue of three wolves that is in a wooded area by the campus' perimeter road, the Geodesic Dome, a globe presented to the university in 1982 when the Space Structures Conference was held there, and pieces of modern art, like the Spine and Narcissus; Narcissus is on loan to the university by artist William Pye. The campus also has eye- catching fish statues. The university says that their aim \\"is to raise a smile\\" from people. The statues were designed and built by Daren Greenhow, made of mechanical parts. At least one of these was designed, according to the artist, based on the phrase \\"A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle\\" ‚Äì it does give a fish a bicycle. Another fish is on a unicycle and juggling, a balancing act representing a busy life. The third is on a tricycle. The fish were commissioned because of the university's contributions to water research. There is a high stainless steel sculpture of a stag on top of a stand at the main entrance to the campus. Designed by sculptor Allan Sly and named The Surrey Stag, it is illuminated at night so that it is always visible. Because of its size, the antlers had to be removed for transport to the site. The metalworkers also pre-tested its strength to ensure it could support students climbing and posing on it. It was unveiled in 2009 by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. It is a tradition at the university to take a photo at the Stag upon graduation or dissertation submission in final year. At the campus amphitheatre is a sculpture called Thinking of My Future, unveiled in 2010. This sculpture depicts a mildly-deformed person looking worried, with one hand scratching their head and the other tightly grasping their leg. There are two separate but connecting walkways from the amphitheatre to the library piazza that pass a mural on the side of the Lecture Theatre building, this was built in 1980 on three aluminium panels by Duncan Newton, and was commissioned by the university's Arts Council. A mural of a tree made of ceramics outside the Students' Union was created by students at the Roehampton Institute of Art, which was connected with the university at the time. There are covered walkways also connecting several academic buildings. These walkways feature artwork that is coloured circles, which are illuminated by lights at night. Initially this was an art project in 1996, both for the dots on the walkways and for artistic impressions to be made of the result, and they were meant to be taken down shortly afterwards, but they still remain.  Natural spaces  The campus has a collection of notable and rare trees, with maps and pamphlets of these available around Guildford. These are spread and regularly planted across the campus. Also on the campus is a lake with a grass area, where social events are held, like the Summer of Cinema in 2018, where films were played throughout the summer for free. The campus supports its natural spaces with eco-friendly initiatives, and in 2018 secured ¬£100,000 in order to fund a bike-sharing scheme for students.

Career Born in Belfast, Moore began his career at Glentoran and had been a youth international. He joined Distillery in August 1953. He earned one representative cap with the Irish League XI, against the Football League XI at Anfield on 20 October 1954. He moved to England and joined Second Division club West Ham United in February 1955. West Ham paid a fee of ¬£3000 and also agreed to play home and away friendly fixtures against the Belfast club. After making his debut in a friendly against Austrian club Simmering on 19 February 1955, a match that the Hammers won 8‚Äì2, Moore was involved in the first match to be televised live from Upton Park, in another friendly against Rotterdam side Holland Sports Club on 22 March. The match against Distillery in Belfast, on 28 March, represented the first time West Ham had travelled to Northern Ireland. Moore was made captain for the game, which ended 2‚Äì2. In the return fixture at Upton Park, Moore scored in a 7‚Äì5 victory for West Ham. Moore made his League debut on the final day of the 1954‚Äì55 season, a 1‚Äì1 draw against Nottingham Forest on 2 May 1955. He then made nine League appearances for West Ham during the 1955‚Äì56 season and also played in the finals of the Essex Professional Cup and London Challenge Cup, before an injury ended his professional career. His final match came against Middlesbrough on 26 December 1955, three days before his 22nd birthday. Moore was hit in the face with the ball, leaving him vertically blind in one eye. The club awarded Moore a testimonial match, jointly with Geoff Hallas, who had also seen his career cut short through injury earlier in the season. The match featured a number of big names in the All Star XI team, such as Jimmy Scoular, Cliff Holton, Roy Paul and Trevor Ford, and also included former West Ham players Harry Hooper and Eric Parsons. Proceeds for the match were due to be halved between the two players, totalling ¬£991 11s 3d from gate receipts and ¬£15 0s 3d from donations for each player. However, a dispute between Moore and his former club, due to his subsequent registration with Cambridge United, meant that he received only ¬£500. After leaving West Ham, Moore played for Eastern Counties League club Cambridge United, making his debut on 10 November 1956. The 1957‚Äì58 season saw him switch to outside right and he scored a club record 68 goals, 49 in the league. He was later made club captain, but after a disagreement with incoming player-manager Alan Moore, he left in 1960 to join Cambridge City. At City, Moore's 19 goals helped the club to the Southern Premier League title in 1962‚Äì63. He scored 34 in all competitions that season. He totalled 107 goals for the Lilywhites before leaving for Wisbech Town, where he was part of the team that suffered a 10‚Äì1 defeat at the hands of Brighton and Hove Albion in an FA Cup game in 1956. Moore later played for Boston United and Newmarket Town. After which, he worked for Cambridge-based electrical company Pye Ltd. and managed their football team. He died of cancer in September 2006.

The film will be distributed by Toho and Universal Pictures, directed by Saiji Yakumo and written by Yasuko Kobayashi. It will be released in Japan on January 18, 2019. The theme song of the film, \\"UNBROKEN\\" by Takanori Nishikawa feat. Tomoyasu Hotei. Plot It is the year 2205. The Saniwa, a sage who has the power to animate legendary swords and bring them to life, informs one of his Touken Danshi (swordsmen) Mikazuki Munechika of the Time Retrograde's Army (TRA) plan to change history by preventing Oda Nobunaga's death at the Honnoji Incident. Mikazuki accepts his mission, but many of the saniwa's swords are away on expeditions. The Saniwa sends a team consisting of six swords left in their citadel home: captain Mikazuki Munechika, Yamanbagiri Kunihiro, Yagen Toushirou, Heshikiri Hasebe, Fudou Yukimitsu, and Nihongou. The six men travel back in time to the Honnoji Incident. At Honno-ji temple, Nobunaga and his vassal, Mori Ranmaru, attempt to hold down the fort while the traitorous Akechi Mitsuhide and his men attacked. Seeing no way out, Nobunaga retreats to his room and commands Mori to hold down the fort. The TRA show up at the scene and attack Akechi‚Äôs soldiers. Hasebe, Fudou, and Nihongou arrive to assist while Yagen and Yamanbagiri tackle a strange individual TRA member whom Yagen notices something odd about. Mikazuki reaches Nobunaga's quarter's in time to stave off the TRA and gives Nobunaga his space to commit seppuku as the flames consume the temple. Their mission complete, the Touken Danshi return to their citadel. They meet their colleague and caretaker of their home, Uguisumaru and a newly arrived Touken Danshi: Honebami Toushirou, older brother to Yagen and former companion of Mikazuki. However, Honebami has lost much of his memory and cannot recall his past. Mikazuki announces his intent to report to the Saniwa but dissuades the eager Hasebe from joining him, raising suspicion among the Touken Danshi. Meanwhile, news of Nobunaga‚Äôs death travels to his general, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He grieves in a mad rage. While the Touken Danshi relax and reflect, Mikazuki reports the success to their aruji (master), the Saniwa. While Mikazuki and the Saniwa discuss recent events, the Touken Danshi become suspicious as to why they have rarely seen their master and only Mikazuki is given an audience with him of late. Mikazuki walks in on the conversation and assures everyone that the master just wants time alone. Nobunaga Oda awakes in a cavern with the strange TRA member. The stranger introduces himself as Mumei (No Name) and pledges the loyalty of the TRA to Oda Nobunaga, who is more than pleased to have cheated death. Mikazuki is urgently summoned to the saniwa's room with the same news. The saniwa is worried for his carelessness, but Mikazuki insists it is his responsibility and will set things right. Both speak as if it was the last time they would see each other, aware of an event that is coming soon. The same team of Touken Danshi assemble, but Uguisumaru said their master requested Honebami to take Fudou‚Äôs place. Uguisumaru confronts Mikazuki about the matter of the saniwa, and Mikazuki relents, sharing with Uguisumaru that he would be needed soon. Nihongou almost walks in on the conversation, and Mikazuki diverts the subject upon hearing Nihongou‚Äôs intrusion. At the portal, Honebami wonders aloud why he was fighting to protect history as Mikazuki and Nihongou finally arrive. Mikazuki announces to the team their new mission: to assassinate Oda Nobunaga. Toyotomi Hideyoshi returns to avenge his lord and goes after Mitsuhide, chasing the traitor to Shoryuuji Castle. Nobunaga and his new TRA army set their plans in motion, sending a messenger to Hideyoshi of his existence. The Touken Danshi split up to trail Nobunaga, Akechi and stop the messenger from reaching Hideyoshi, but not before Yamanbagiri, Hasebe and Nihongou air their concerns about Mikazuki. Mikazuki addresses Honebami‚Äôs concerns, and asks him for a favor. Yagen and Yamanbagiri trail Mitsuhide, and bump into Mikazuki and Honebami who were trailing Nobunaga. Nobunaga attacks Akechi directly, but in a change of heart Mumei jumps between the two men in defense of Mitsuhide. Before Nobunaga could cut down Mumei, Mikazuki intervenes. He directs Nobunaga away and flees into the night. The other Touken Danshi attempt to follow, but a huge ootachi brute forces them to retreat before re-assuming control over Mumei. Akechi Mitsuhide vanishes from history. Hasebe and Nihongou trail the messenger to Hideyoshi and cut him down, but Hideyoshi had received the letter. Despite being persuaded that the letter was fake, Hideyoshi reveals to the two that he is going to occupy Nobunaga‚Äôs castle, Azuchi Castle, and they were going with him. Yamanbagiri and Nihongou trade missives via carrier pigeon and agree to meet up at Azuchi Castle. Mikazuki tells Nobunaga that he only wishes to escort him to Azuchi Castle safely. Nobunaga does not trust Mikazuki, given what he learned from the TRA of their interference at Honnoji. However, he accepts Mikazuki‚Äôs aid. Yamanbagiri and Yagen are left at a loss at Mikazuki‚Äôs seeming betrayal to run off with Nobunaga. As Honebami assists them, they decide that if they must, they would stop Mikazuki with whatever it took. On route to Azuchi, Hideyoshi takes a break with Nihongou and Hasebe. He reveals to them his plan: That he knew all along that the two were lying, Nobunaga was indeed alive and he intends to kill Nobunaga himself. The two Touken Danshi foil Hideyoshi‚Äôs attempt to assassinate them and narrowly escape. Mikazuki and Nobunaga arrive at Azuchi Castle, with Nobunaga waiting expectantly for Hideyoshi to arrive with support. Nobunaga goads Mikazuki, insisting that his history now is the correct history. The TRA split up their forces, with Mumei protecting Nobunaga while the ootachi leaves to complete their own mission: an attack on the shields of the saniwa‚Äôs citadel. An alarmed Fudou rushes to find the saniwa lost in a bright glow, and Uguisumaru finally fills Fudou in on what is truly happening. Hideyoshi arrives at Azuchi Castle, as Nobunaga had hoped, and starts attacking its walls while ordering his men to ‚Äòflush Mitsuhide‚Äôs men out‚Äô. Angered, Nobunaga draws his sword on Mikazuki, who only calmly replies that history can be rewritten but Nobunaga is still doomed. The rest of the Touken Danshi arrive to find Azuchi Castle under attack. Yagen, Nobunaga‚Äôs dagger, finally recalls the corrected history with Mikazuki: Nobunaga escapes Honnoji with Mori‚Äôs help, but dies at Azuchi Castle. Mikazuki‚Äôs buried historical secret is revealed as Hideyoshi brandishes the sword of Mikazuki Munechika, a war spoil that Nobunaga gifted to Hideyoshi. Mumei and the TRA move in to attack Hideyoshi‚Äôs men, and the Touken Danshi rush in. Honebami speeds past the rest and leaves them behind to face the rest of the enemies head on. Mikazuki leaves Nobunaga behind to fight the TRA and reunites with Honebami, who passes him a bag of items. Mikazuki prepares to leave, but Nobunaga holds Honebami at knifepoint and demands Mikazuki to escort him to safety. Mikazuki refuses, and answers that over his time of protecting history, he found much he cherishes and protecting history as he knew it protected their lives, addressing Honebami‚Äôs question. Nobunaga is not satisfied, but Mikazuki reminds him that he protects Nobunaga the demon lord, the fearsome and ruthless general that will be remembered for time to come, but that man was now begging to live and looked pitiful. Ultimately bested, Nobunaga releases Honebami and accepts his fate. The shields of the citadel give way and the ootachi brute materializes with his army on the citadel grounds. Uguisumaru and Fudou confront them, ready for battle. Mikazuki rejoins the exhausted Touken Danshi outside the castle but reveals that Honebami had taken their teleportation marbles and passed them to him. As Honebami returns, he informs the Touken Danshi that their master needed them urgently and sends them all back to the citadel. He confronts the enemy for his final battle. Upon return, Uguisumaru greets the team only to find that Mikazuki was not with them. The truth is revealed: The saniwa was transferring out due to advanced age and loss of power. This put the citadel at its weakest state and the TRA had chosen to attack their home at this critical moment. At Azuchi Castle, Mikazuki fights a losing battle. After taking repeated hits, he gives out and falls - only to be caught by Hasebe and the returning Touken Danshi. They received new orders from their master: to retrieve Mikazuki Munechika. Rejuvenated and reunited, they take on Mumei and the TRA and successfully eradicate them, as Nobunaga uses Yagen Toushirou the blade to commit seppuku successfully. As the Touken Danshi return to the citadel, a swirl of sakura petals surround Mumei and bring him along. The team returns to assist Uguisumaru and Fudou, while Mikazuki stops the ootachi brute from directly attacking the saniwa. With the last greeting that he‚Äôs home, Mikazuki says farewell to the saniwa who vanishes in the light. Mikazuki throws the ootachi out for a final confrontation, only for Mumei to sink his blade into the ootachi. Mumei finally overcomes his possession and reveals himself to be a Touken Danshi: Kurikara Gou, Akechi Mitsuhide‚Äôs short blade that was used against Nobunaga. Altogether, the Touken Danshi finish off the ootachi brute and end the TRA‚Äôs interference. After some time, the entire retinue of Touken Danshi await Mikazuki in the saniwa‚Äôs hall. He reveals to them their new saniwa, a little girl. Mikazuki mused to his old aruji that he now had even more to cherish and protect as the other Touken Danshi played with their new aruji in peaceful times.

Since its debut in 2012, the show has appeared mainly at casinos in the Las Vegas area. History Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Las Vegas in 2019, featuring (from left to right): Robin McAuley, Christian Brady, Howard Leese, Blas Elias, and Michael T. Ross. Doug Aldrich performing \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" during the show in July 2014 at the Westgate Las Vegas The concept for the show originated in 2011 with British record producer Simon Napier-Bell, who envisioned a touring rock supergroup playing covers of hit songs from the 1960s and 1970s. Napier-Bell joined with his longtime business partner, Harry Cowell, to produce the show. They enlisted John Payne, former lead singer of the band Asia, to help develop the idea. Interest in the concept soon faded, though, because the projected production costs were too high. Months later, Payne, inspired by his involvement with the touring production of Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds, reimagined the concept as a theatrical production with a plot line that would tell the story of rock and roll in chronological order. Payne brought record producer David Kershenbaum on to co-write the script with him. Cowell financed the show for $1 million through his publicly traded production company, Papa Entertainment. Raiding the Rock Vault debuted on November 29, 2012 with a performance at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles. That show was recorded to be shown to potential promoters for a concert tour. The feedback from promoters, however, suggested that the show would be well suited for Las Vegas. Cast member Paul Shortino arranged for the producers to meet with executives of the LVH ‚Äì Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, and a deal was quickly reached. The show opened in March 2013 at the LVH. Cowell fired Payne from the show in June 2014 because of an unspecified business dispute, shortly before the LVH came under new ownership and became the Westgate Las Vegas. Westgate owner David Siegel liked the show and asked to buy the rights to it, planning to rename it as Westgate Rocks; Cowell refused the offer. Uncertain about their standing at the Westgate, the producers accepted an offer to move to the Tropicana Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Payne filed a lawsuit claiming he was owed royalties and performance fees; it was eventually settled. The show closed at the Westgate in September 2014, and then reopened in November in the 1,100-seat theater at the Tropicana. In the interim, the show was revamped to remove material developed by Payne, including the narrative about the discovery of the \\"rock vault\\" in a Mayan temple. Instead, the songs were bracketed by comedy sketches portraying stories recalled by two fictional roadies from their years of touring with rock bands. A sister show, Raiding the Country Vault, featuring classic country music songs in a similar format, was launched by Cowell and Napier-Bell in Branson, Missouri in May 2016. The producers ended the run at the Tropicana in July 2016, because they were not able to consistently sell the 300 to 400 tickets per night needed to cover their costs. The show started a new run in March 2017 at the 650-seat Vinyl nightclub at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. To fit in the smaller venue, the comedy sketches were eliminated from the show, along with the \\"vault\\" prop that had previously sat at the center of the set. In 2017 and 2018, a second company of Raiding the Rock Vault appeared for limited engagements at the Starlite Theatre in Branson. Producers also had plans for a worldwide tour, and pop and Latin versions of the show. In December 2019, Raiding the Rock Vault played 3 shows in London, England. On September 30, 2019 it was announced that the show would move to RIO Las Vegas in 2020 as the current location, Hard Rock Hotel Las Vegas, would be closing for renovations. On January 11, 2020, Raiding the Rock Vault launched at 172 Live Music club inside RIO All-Suites Hotel and Casino Las Vegas.

History By 1922, groups to defend foreign born communists began to emerge locally, but a National Council for Protection of Foreign Born did not form until May 1926. In 1933, Roger Nash Baldwin of the American Civil Liberties Union formed the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born. The committee sought to defend rights of foreign born, especially radicals and Communist Party members, who went otherwise legally undefended. It pursued three avenues: litigation, legislation, and public education. The US federal government determined that the committee worked closely with the International Labor Defense, legal arm of the Communist Party USA, in turn an arm of the Soviet-formed Communist International and thus supported Party (Soviet) policies. In the 1930s, the committee campaigned for asylum rights for refugees of European fascism who faced deportation. After the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, the committee protected fighters against Francisco Franco who could not (re-)enter the United States legally, e.g., American members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. During World War II, the committee joined the Popular Front in promoting national unity against fascism. It helped Japanese-Americans after internment. It successfully defended CPUSA leader William Schneiderman against cancelation of his naturalization due to communist memberships. It defended Australian-born labor leader Harry Bridges. During the early Cold War, the US federal government increased its efforts to deport foreign born trade unionists and Communists; it also attacked the committee itself. In June 1948, Attorney General Tom C. Clark added the committee to a Justice Department list of \\"subversive\\" organizations. The McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950 and the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act of 1952 targeted foreign born Communist Party members. In 1950, Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. asked the Subversive Activities Control Board to make the committee register as a Communist front. In 1951, executive secretary, Abner Green went to imprisoned for six months for refusing to submit names of contributors. In January 1952, Carol Weiss King, general counsel, died. From 1955 to 1957, the committee faced a charge of violating charitable laws. In 1957, a New York State Supreme Court ex parte injunction stopped the committee from all activities. The committee reformed as a charitable organization. Although also in 1957, the United States Supreme Court reversed deportation of Charles Rowoldt based on membership in the Communist Party, the committee gave up direct legal defense of foreign born to focus on public opinion and legislation, e.g., revision or repeal of the McCarran-Walter Act. In the 1960s, the committee focused on discrimination against Mexican immigrants and West Indian workers. It campaigned to establish a statute of limitation, to eliminate supervisory parole, and to defend the free speech and association of foreign born. Specific bills targeted included the Rodino Bill and the Field-Knorr Bill, \\"both of which proposed the establishment of sanctions against employers of 'illegal' aliens.\\" The committee also defended political asylum for Haitians. On April 26, 1965, the United States Supreme Court in American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born, Petitioner, v. Subversive Activities Control Board affirmed an order of the Subversive Activities Control Board requiring that the committee, represented by Joseph Forer, must register as a 'Communist-front' organization. In 1977, the committee helped win right to public education for children of illegally immigrated parents. In 1982, the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee absorbed the committee. Organization The US federal government deemed both Communist front organizations that worked closely with the International Labor Defense, legal arm of the Communist Party USA, in turn an arm of the Soviet-formed Communist International. Both groups supported Party (Soviet) policies. The American Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born had ties to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. The American Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born had various subcommittees: * Regional: New York Committee for Protection of Foreign Born, Los Angeles Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, Bay Cities Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born (Pittsburgh), Clatsop County Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born (Oregon), Midwest Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, Committee for Protection of Oregon's Foreign Born, Western Pennsylvania Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, Detroit Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, East Bay Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, East Side Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, etc. * Ethnic: Albanian Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born (Michigan), American-Polish Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, American- Yugoslav Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born (Pittsburgh), Bulgarian- American Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, Czechoslovak Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, Estonian Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, Greek-American Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, Hungarian-American Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, Italian- American Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, etc. * Regional and Ethnic: Chicago-Greek Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, Chicago- Jewish Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, New York-Polish Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born, etc. * People Defended: Charles Doyle Defense Committee, Claudia Jones Defense Committee, Committee for the Defense of Martin Karasek, Harry Bridges Defense Committee, etc. In 1950, the Internal Security Act listed as a \\"subversive\\" \\"Communist-front\\" organization. People The committee had a small staff. Dwight C. Morgan served as executive secretary from 1933 to 1939. Abner Green succeeded him and served from 1941 to 1959. Carol Weiss King served as general counsel from 1942 to 1952; she also co-founded the International Juridical Association (IJA). Ira Gollobin served as associate counsel from 1936-1966 and then general counsel from 1967 to 1982.

Inflammatory glaucoma which occurs in phacolysis is a condition which is a result of the leakage of protein within the lens into the capsule of a mature or hyper mature cataract and involves a simple procedure to be cured that is referred to as cataract extraction. The main symptoms of glaucoma include pain in the eye, redness and loss of sight, all of which reduce an individuals independence, in turn, reducing quality of life and an individuals ability fulfill other societal roles (such as driving and reading) as it reduces visual clarity. Phacolysis tends to be more frequently reported in underdeveloped countries because of the lack of resources necessary to treat such as condition.  Signs and symptoms There are a variety of characteristics which indicate that an individual may have phacolytic glaucoma. Within older people, the lens of the eye may appear to be yellow and lose its transparency (becomes cloudy). Once the protein begins to seep into the lens, permanent damage to the lens may be caused as the precipitate in lens impairs vision. Another symptom includes the fading of visual clarity. This symptom makes the eye create an image commonly described to appear as though looking through a waterfall. If the lens becomes completely opaque the individual will become blind, even though the photoreceptors are completely functional. Other common symptoms include; * clouding of the eyes natural lens * increase in intraocular pressure, which lies behind the iris and the pupil * red eyes * acute onset pain * tearing * corneal edema * photophobia (experience of discomfort to the eyes because of the exposure of high levels of light or by presence of physical sensitivity within the eyes) * significantly decreased vision. The major influencers of this illness include high exposure to the sun and age as this is a rare condition for individuals under the age of 35.  Causes  Cataracts, if left untreated, can develop into a mature state or hyper mature state, and may progressively become leaky thereby excreting proteins. Cataracts are caused by a breakdown of proteins which allows the lens to become cloudy and gradually turn opaque, causing a decrease in vision. Through the leakage of proteins that have a high molecular weight an obstruction of the drainage mechanism of the eye is caused.  Diagnosis  Lens of the eye becomes cloudy once affected by the cataract. A variety of procedures can be used to physically diagnose phacolytic glaucoma as there are a variety of other types of glaucoma which may be confused with phacolysis such as acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG), lens-particle glaucoma, neovascular glaucoma, phacomorphic glaucoma and uveitic glaucoma which can cause confusion in which procedures need to be conducted to revamp vision. The first type of diagnosis procedure referred to as a ‚Äòslit lamp examination‚Äô of phacolytic glaucoma allows for specific identification of microcystic corneal edema and the presence of macrophages, white material (dotted with patches within the inside capsule of the lens) and intense flare and iridescent or hyper-refringent particles specific to phacolytic glaucoma. The time period which symptoms have been affecting the patient should be obtained as experiencing symptoms for a period longer than 5 days may result in further issues such as glaucomatous disc damage or poorer prognosis. Additionally, previous cataract or trauma surgery which have been conducted must be accounted for so that an accurate diagnosis of current symptoms which could be caused because of these previous experiences. An ophthalmologic examination is another procedure which must be conducted to effectively diagnose phacolytic glaucoma. This test will indicate high levels of inflammation due to high intraocular pressures within the eyes. Additionally, the presence of calcium oxalate and cholesterol crystals from the degenerating cataract lens is an indication of phacolytic glaucoma but can only be identified by puncturing the cataract. This is specifically used to differentiate between uveitic glaucoma where keratic precipitates are present rather than calcium oxalate.  Target Population  Phacolysis is evident, more commonly, within elderly people as a result of cataracts that have developed over time. There are other factors which contribute to the development of phacolysis in seniors. This is clearly indicated through the increase of intraocular pressure, which usually occurs when anterior flow faces obstruction of the anterior flow to the aqueous humor. Essentially, the eye requires a photosynthetic pigment which allows for light to become chemical energy. Within seniors this pigment overtime splits with the oxygen to thereby generate phacolysis.  Treatment  alt= The procedure involved in the curing of phacolysis includes the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in the eye followed by cataract extraction surgery. Medical management is commonly used simply to control the inflammation temporarily. The reduction of intraocular pressure can be conducted through the use of a combination of topical and systemic IOP-lowering agents, cycloplegics, aqueous suppressants, hyper-osmotic agents, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Topical steroids also may assist in lowering intraocular pressure and decreasing pain. Previous to cataract surgery a variety of optometrical tests have to be conducted to comprehensively analyse an individuals eye-sight prior to the surgery. A refraction is also conducted to determine how much nearsightedness, farsightedness and/or astigmatism an individual may have. Additional specific measurements of the eye will be necessary in order to determine the curvature and length of the cornea in order to choose the most effective IOL which will need to be inserted during the surgery. Cataract surgery has become a very simple process which, with modern-day technology, can be conducted in a local anaesthetic procedure in an average time period of 15 minutes. The aim of cataract surgery is to replace the lens within the eye with an artificial lens to clear vision while removing any residue which could cloud vision. The cataract extraction surgery involves four major steps which includes; local anaesthetic, clearing of eye, intraocular lens is inserted and finally the contact lens to protect the eye which dissolves releasing antibiotics. Before major advancements in medical technology, cuts had to be manually made to the lens to conduct cataract extraction surgery, however, with the improvements in technology the LASIK procedure is the main procedure used to conduct cataract surgeries. This procedure involves the use of femtosecond lasers which allow for precision cuts to create the corneal flap necessary to clear the cataract which were substituted for use instead of a surgical tool which is generally hand-held by the surgeon to conduct the same incision manually. The corneal incision, the anterior capsulotomy and lens and cataract fragmentation are steps in which can be an alternative. Within this process, lasers strike a titanium-like target that are attached to an irrigation-aspiration probe. It is said that the utilisation of this laser will enable for better precision, accuracy and reproducibility for the corneal incision, the anterior capsulotomy and lens and cataract, therefore ensuring the reduction of risks and enabling for refined visual development of phacolysis and the extraction of cataract. When completing the surgery the utilisation of laser cataract surgery will allow for a precise incision resulting in a self-sealing process, enabling for the reduction of infection after the surgery. Therefore, as a result of the advancements in which the laser cataract surgery has provided, regarding the removal of the lens, surgeons have been able to complete the procedure in a more efficient manner and thereby ensure an improvement in the outcomes for individuals suffering from phacolysis. Additionally, the laser cataract procedures which are used to cure phacolysis have a success rate of 98% further proving this procedure's effectiveness. The main issue with this technology is that the process costs about $300,000 to $500,000 and like all surgical procedures there is a degree of risk. Within the cataract removal procedures which take place a variety of complications may occur including; * chronic inflammation inside the eye * retinal detachment * infection Rehabilitation  Patient using eyepatch after cataract surgery to reduce the risk of infection. There are several medications which need to be consumed in order to treat phacolytic glaucoma. The medicines induced ensure the management of glaucoma and reduce inflammation. These medications consist of: Aqueous suppressants, anti-inflammatory drugs, hyper-osmotic agents, cycloplegics, anti-glaucoma medications. Medical therapy, however, is only a temporary treatment until cataract surgery can take place. The use of an eyepatch for a certain amount of time, as well as a contact lens to protect the eye which dissolves releasing antibiotics, must be incorporated in the rehabilitation process to reduce the risk of infection of the eye and to allow for an effective healing process. Additionally, the patient must consistently visit the specialist in order to ensure a successful removal of phacolytic glaucoma. There may be a need for medical therapies which treat arising issues for the eye such as inflammation. These medical therapy procedures for phacolysis consist of controlling the intraocular pressure which may include the use of topical steroids in order to decrease inflammation in the eye, and mydriatics in order to prevent the formation of synechiae.  Medication  It is found that with most cases, of phacolytic glaucoma post surgery patients are not exposed to many further obstacles in the healing process which therefore avoids the need for medication. Although, it is mostly encouraged that patients take antiglaucoma medication in order to deter the possibility of glaucoma and inflammation implicating the eye. One of these medications include eye drops which contain prostaglandin analogs. Prostaglandin analogs aim to lower intraocular pressure which thereby avoids inflammation to ensure an efficient healing process after cataract removal. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) in the form of pills, disables the production of the sodium pump in the aqueous humor and thereby decreases inflammation to, in turn, lower intraocular pressure. Astigmatism condition. The only major obstacle which could affect the healing process after the surgery necessary to treat phacolytic glaucoma would be an infection to the eye. The ophthalmologists' conducting the surgery must aim to reduce the amount of microbes which are present on the ocular surface and avoid intracocular contamination during the procedure. These tasks can be conducted through the use of intracameral and topical antibiotics. Intracameral antibiotics are usually injections which are put into the eye or ocular surface to rid of microbes. Topical antibiotics come in the form of tablets which can be consumed through the mouth to treat bacterial infection. The use of either or both are left to the surgeon and their personal opinion on the possibility of bacterial infection.  Astigmatism Correction  Astigmatism involves a deficiency in the optical capacity of the eye whereby the angle of light passing through the eye deviates and becomes distorted visuals due to the light rays, avoiding a common focus. Astigmatisms are the result of the cornea forming more in the shape of a curve in comparison to other meridians. Therefore, in order to reduce this, minor incisions must be taken in place of the cornea which, as previously mentioned, is forming in the shape of a curve, which will flatten the turn to a little extent, thereby allowing the cornea to be rounder and uniform. By performing astigmatism in order to correct the removal of cataract the requirement of prescription glasses and reading glasses post cataract extraction is avoided and ensures better vision for patients. Astigmatism rates increase dramatically from 14.3% in the under 15-year-old age group to 67.2% in the age group of over 65-years old. Since astigmatism affects the population of people over 65-years old which are more likely to suffer from phacolytic glaucoma it is an effective procedure which can take place during the cataract surgery used to correct phacolytic glaucoma and improve the quality of life of sufferers.  Epidemiology  The youngest patient found to be diagnosed with Phacolytic Glaucoma was 35 years of age, which thereby highlights its significant prevalence in senior patients. Moreover, Phacolytic Glaucoma is more likely seen in underdeveloped countries as a result of the lack of access to ophthalmologic care. When being faced with Phacolytic Glaucoma most cases ameliorate when the cataract is extracted thereby enhancing vision. On the other hand, this disease is less prevalent in developed countries such as Australia and the United States, due to a greater access to health care and earlier cataract surgery.

Although Kenya's economy is the largest and most developed in eastern and central Africa, 36.1% (2015/2016) of its population lives below the international poverty line.60 percent population living below poverty line: World bank report. (2013). Business Recorder This severe poverty is mainly caused by economic inequality, government corruption and health problems. In turn, poverty also worsens these factors. Fortunately, Kenya's government has made many efforts to address the issue of poverty, and it has received significant help from international institutions as well. The incident rate of poverty has streadily decreased, as shown by a recent MPI index. However, the end to poverty in Kenya still needs long-term efforts.  Definition and measures of poverty   Definition  Poverty is a condition that someone lacks of materials or money and has a low level of standard of living. It is a complicated concept, reflected by many aspects including social, economic and political factors.  Multidimensional poverty index  The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) incorporates 10 variables to explore poverty in three dimensions i.e. standard of living, education and health. It is more scientific and practical to measure poverty as it reflects both incidence rate and the degree to which a population is deprived. The 2014 global MPI data shows that the number of Kenyans being MPI poor is 39.9%, indicated by the headcount ratio. This implies that poverty still is a severe issue in Kenya. According to the information from OPHI Country Briefing 2017, poor people in Kenya significantly deprived in the living standard dimension, especially for cooking fuel, electricity and sanitation indicators. In addition, poverty differs between different regions, and the percentage of MPI Poor deprivation in rural areas is higher than that in urban areas.  Dynamic poverty in Kenya  The following information mainly focuses on trends of Kenya's poverty from 1990 to 2007. The diagram shows trends in the gross domestic product of Kenya from 1960 to 2017. In the 1990s, the reduction by about 5% in GDP growth rate indicated that Kenya's economic become stagnant and even shrunk. The teetering economy made the poverty issue much more severe, reflected by a 12% ascending poverty incidence rate from 2000 to 2003. In order to address the issue, the government introduced some policies, such as National Poverty Eradication Plan and Poverty Reduction Strategy. However, due to ineffective implementation, it failed to alleviate poverty radically. After the new government taking office in 2003, there were early signs of economic recovery in Kenya. The annual GDP growth rate continued to increase during the period from 2003 to 2007. Owing to the success of the Economic Recovery Strategy developed by the new government, children had access to free primary education. To some extent, improved education level and an economic boom have eased the poverty in Kenya.  Economic condition and poverty  Kenya has kept the leading economic position in the East African region with the gross domestic product at 74.84 billion US dollars in 2017. The Kenyan economy mainly relies on agriculture, livestock keeping and tourism. Although only less than 20% of the land is suitable for cultivation, the agriculture industry still takes the dominant position in Kenya's economy. More than 75 percent of the population in Kenya makes a living from agriculture. However, an extensively distributed arid desert, unpredictable weather changes and backward technology makes the agricultural sector quite erratic. In Kenya, 80% of the territory is classified into arid and semi-arid lands, where there is highly variable rainfall and frequent droughts. More than a quarter of the population and half of livestock live in these areas. In times of serious drought, the government has to spend on average 50 dollars per family in relief supplies. There was a severe drought in Kenya that began in October 2016, due to low rainfall and extremely high temperatures. In April 2017, the drought escalated and was declared a national emergency by the Kenyan government. The drought gave rise to a slump in production of the staple crop (maize) and more than 2 million people were in need of food aid. Droughts reduce crop and livestock production, cause great financial losses in agriculture and increase unemployment rates. Besides, decline in food production forces the government to provide food assistance, incurring extra expenditures in the national budget. All these situations trigger more severe poverty issues in Kenya.  Social inequality and poverty  Kenya is an lower middle income unequal country and its inequality mainly reflected in wealth distribution, poverty level and human rights aspects. Kenya's inequality is reflected by share of income and social services varying among different segments of the population. To be more specific, one-tenth of Kenyans have grasp approximately two-fifths of total wealth, implying that the overwhelming majority of Kenyans only shares less than 60 percent of the total wealth. The wealth gap has not narrowed, even though the statistics show that the economy has grown by 19 percent. Disclosed by the World Bank in 2015, Kenya's GINI index was 40.8%, indicating the unequal distribution of income. Distribution of welfare may always be a challenge to Kenya, because income inequality is a factor leading to social conflicts, violence, crime, which aggravates social instability and poverty issues. In addition, poverty level is unequal in different regions. Measured by MPI, the percentage of poor people is much lower in the capital city. Compared to that, some large secondary cities‚Äô percentage of poor people is much higher. For instance, there is 44% of population in Mombasa in relatively poor condition. In addition to the huge inequality between different level of cities, inequalities in poverty level exists within cities. For example, in Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, Kileleshwa's location level poverty is under 5%, while location level poverty of Korogocho and Laini Saba excess 60%.  Gender inequality and poverty  Kenya has significant gender inequality and Kenyan women continue to advocate for their equal right to property, security, financial services, healthcare, and education. Women may still need their spouse or father's consent before accessing a healthcare provider or taking time off from their traditional household roles. Most institutions providing healthcare in Kenya afford women very little say over their own bodies; they may be forced to undergo abortions or female circumcision. They also risk the chance of being reported to authorities if the physician believes that they were engaging in prostitution or drug use. Women also lack a basic education in Kenya and very few go on to higher education. Nearly 60% of young women do not attend secondary school either because there is no school close by or the school has little in the way of educational resources. Even in schools, teachers put more value on teaching boys than girls, which usually allows men to be significantly more educated and access higher levels of education, while women are left behind. Financial services and property rights are also still limited, as women have very little access to the basic needs and legal rights to start a business or live self- sufficiently. Only 1% of Kenyan women own property and there are few women in business. Women cannot open a bank account without their husband's or father's written approval, and they are rarely able to access the collateral to jump start a business. They also have little to no voice when speaking with city councils.  Government corruption and poverty  Corruption remains a severe and non-negligible issue in Kenya. There are 180 countries participating in the assessment of the corruption perceptions index. Kenya has ranked at 143 with the score of 28 in 2017. And the score of Kenya for the past five years has fluctuated between 25 and 28, implying that corruption is still a serious problem. Kenya's corruption is prevalent within all levels of government with various ways. Studies have found that Kenya is one of the most crime-infested countries in Africa. One of reasons is that even the police help crime. Especially in some rural areas, the police provide arms to criminals, assist to transfer stolen goods and release arrested criminals if criminals bribe the police. The increasing criminal rate leads to instability of the society that directly reduces economic growth and further causes poverty problems. Apart from bribe-taking, improper government expenditure and illegal possession of public resources by senior government officials also worsens Kenya's corruption phenomenon. Some authority institutions, such as judiciary and legislature, are even considered as the channel of corruption. In the major reforms in 2011, many unqualified judges were removed from their positions. Not strictly obeying the law is a common phenomenon in Kenya, and this type of phenomenon gives rise to cynicism and undermine social value, because instead of following the legitimate process, people in Kenya often find it easier to use corruption to solve problems. The society in Kenya without authoritative orders and binding regulations fails to establish effective social order and make good use of all public resources, which leads to poverty.  Health problems and poverty  Addressing health problems remains a challenge for Kenya's government. Diseases that spread in the society reduce productivity and increases the health care expenditure of government, which worsens the poverty in Kenya. According to the data from Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, diseases including pneumonia, HIV and malaria are main causes of mortality, which brings about 11.5%, 16.1% and 11.5% of deaths in the total register deaths respectively. In particular, Kenya is ranked as 4th in highest HIV infections countries in the world with 1.6 million people infected with HIV. People with poor health condition decreases household incomes and increase medical expenditures, which may cause households to fall into poverty. HIV and malaria are especially prevalent in marginal areas, such as the Western and Nyanza Provinces. More than three-fifths of households in Kenya fall into poverty due to these diseases. Furthermore, decreasing available workforces and increasing government expenditures further strains the economy and worsens poverty.  Water problems and poverty  Data from the Society for International Development shows that although nearly half of Kenya's people have access to improved water supply, there are over 19 million Kenyans still drinking unimproved water, such as unsafe water from rivers. Besides, there is large inequality in access of safe water. There are about 30 percent more improved water sites in urban areas than in rural areas. One of major causes of water crisis in Kenya is frequent droughts. The Society for International Development has revealed that rivers are the most common supply of Kenya's drinking water. However, more than half of Kenya's regions are classified as arid and are very arid areas with annual average rainfall at a very low level, and global warming exacerbates this situation. Rivers are an unstable source of water, especially in a dry climate period. Droughts damage Kenya's agricultural economy, cause famine and result in an even worse hygienic condition. According to data from the World Bank, renewable internal freshwater resources have been decreasing from 1970 to now. Kenya is classified as a water limited country. According to data from the World Bank, the amount of renewable internal freshwater resources per capita has been decreasing from past to now and it has declined to under 450 cubic meters per capita in 2014. According to the research conducted by Kimani-Murage and Ngindu in 2007, main activities that causes contamination of water in Kenya are washing clothes in rivers, pouring pollutants into rivers and using unclean containers to get water. These are especially common in rural area and some urban slums. People in these areas often have no cleaner options. High population growth rate and inappropriate water policy also make the water problem become more severe. Unsafe water can cause diseases like bilharzia, cholera and diarrhea, while stagnant water is a breeding ground for mosquitoes that cause malaria infections to skyrocket. Shown by MSF clinic, three-fifths of all consultation is classified as caused by poor sanitation diseases. Over 5 thousand children die from water-related diseases per day. Due to the severe water crisis, many Kenyans‚Äô basic standards of living are not guaranteed and incidence of related diseases is high, which increases financial burden on the government and exacerbates poverty .  Poverty reduction   National Poverty Eradication Plan  With the assistance of the Commission of Poverty Eradication and Poverty Eradication Unit, the National Poverty Eradication provided various poverty reduction programmes to against poverty in Kenya. It attempted to increase the poor households' living standard. For instance, for householders with low income that were unable to have access safe food, health care and education, implements of the plan improved their condition through using money from the exchequer. Objectives of the NPEP involved wide aspects, such as universal education, primary health care, safe drinking water and abolishing the gap between rural and urban social development. They are monitored by Anti Poverty Trust Fund.  Economic Recovery Strategy  In 2003, the Kenya's government launched the Economic Recovery Strategy, which focused on three areas; the economy, equity and reformation of governance. Due to the success of the strategy in the economic area, fiscal deficit and stock of non-performing loans have decreased, implying the more stable economic structure. In addition, the government encourages the private sector to be actively involved in offering infrastructure services. To alleviate poverty, the government succeeded to achieve the goal of universal primary education. It enlarged the scope of health services and water services, which reduced the incident rate of HIV and other epidemic diseases and improved the living condition of poor people. In addition, the government created more jobs and helped people living in arid areas address the unstable weather effects on agriculture. To complete the sound management system, the ERS attempted to drive judicial reform and transformation of government functions, which further helped establish a stable social order and increase transparency in government affairs. Kenya Vision 2030 Launched in 2008 by President Mwai Kibaki, Kenya Vision 2030 aims to transform Kenya into an actively modernizing middle-income country that provides a better quality of life for every Kenyan by 2030.UN Sustainable Development . UN Sustainable Development , sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/13118Kenya_review_Beijing20.pdf. As the plan is based on four pillars‚Äîeconomic and macro, social, and political‚ÄîVision 2030 works to provide more democratic solutions to societal problems. Small and medium-sized businesses are seen as key to economic development; for example, Vision 2030 will make fertilizer available to small farmers by building a local fertilizer plant. In the political arena, Vision 2030 emphasizes the new 2010 Kenyan Constitution which mandates that women get 1/3 representation in parliament. Lastly, they aim to provide more access to primary education through increased funding and reconstruction of primary schools in more rural geographic areas.

By mid-1876, funds had been raised and a half-block of land had been donated by the Central Pacific Railroad. The school opened October 12, 1876, on a site on the edge of town (\\"the walk from the depot to the school was nearly half the way through sagebrush, and north and west was an unbroken waste of sage as far as the eye could see\\") with fifty pupils and five teachers under the leadership of principal Kate A.

Academic classwork was offered through the twelfth grade, including art, music, foreign languages, and domestic science. In 1886 Bishop Whitaker moved to Pennsylvania. On March 31, 1886, the University of Nevada moved from Elko to a site near Whitaker's. While the University required a basic entrance exam, students from Nevada high schools were not required to take that exam; and the University did not charge tuition. (The tuition at Whitaker's ran as high as $65 per month.)  Shutdown and legacy  In 1894, Whitaker's School shut down. The old building was leased to the university and used as a dormitory until the 1896 completion of Lincoln Hall. The Washoe County School District used parts of the building to house various classes during periods of construction. The building was converted into a hospital; later, the City of Reno purchased it.

Social and economic considerations   Higher classes  The financial and political facets marriage pertained were the key considerations in choosing a spouse for higher classes. It was a customary practice for noble families to sign contracts which betrothed their children in advance. This ensures a suitable match, which allowed for strategic advancements in society. However, these negotiations for marriage were not done in isolation. It was a matter of wider concern that involved the collective decisions of the family, kin and community. This was due to the concept of lineage and preservation of status, which emphasized increasing and transmitting inheritance from one generation to another. These central considerations of marriage formed the basis of endogamy, where individuals only married within their social group. Such example includes the case of Sir William Locke, where he would only allow a prospective suitor to marry his daughter after providing his account books, that indicated his economic worth was of value The announcement of a marriage was preceded by negotiations regarding the practice of dowry. This concerned the contribution of cash and goods provided by the father of the bride. It also involved an exchange by the groom‚Äôs father of a jointure, which acted as a pension guaranteeing money, property and goods that would secure the maintenance of the bride if she were to become widowed. This financial security was in addition to what the husband would leave his wife in the will. In a society that followed primogeniture, the marriage among sons displayed different patterns. A clear distinction was made between the first-born sons and their younger brothers. This was because the eldest son was the heir apparent and had the responsibility of ensuring the continuum of the lineage. It meant first-born sons married in their early twenties and saw them inherit the family‚Äôs wealth. On some occasions, the inheritance would be divided among the children, however, the younger siblings would receive a significantly less proportion. This often resulted in a considerably late marriage for the younger brothers, as they were required to accumulate income through individual efforts. Early marriages for them could lead to economic hardships and a lifestyle far from their upbringing. However, if they decided to remain unmarried, the luxurious of their household would satisfy the rest of their lives as a gentleman. For a woman, it was essential to maintain or progress her position within society. Despite their rank, women were seen as the submissive sex and were treated as second class citizens. Women were expected to marry and perform their primary roles of being obedient wives and child bearers. As they were restricted to marriage and motherhood, women relied heavily on their husband for financial support and economic security was deeply sought. Such an example includes Elizabeth Howard, whose father-in-law agreed to settle several manors as her jointure. The fifth commandment ‚ÄúHonour thy father and mother‚Äù, reiterated this social value which saw children accepting marriage arrangements by their parents without much objection. Even in the case of parental death, instructions were left to advisers which described the conditions under which the children were permitted to marry. In a period where there were high mortality rates among adults, this was often specified in wills. According to a primary account in 1558, the will of Michael Wentworth detailed that a significantly lower dowry would be provided to disobedient daughter who were not ‚Äúadvised by my executors, but of their own fantastical brain bestow themselves lightly upon a light person‚Äù. Despite children being required to obey their parents and remain loyal to the family, evidence suggestion that there were cases where disobedience would occur. Such as in the example of Thomas Thynne of Longleat and Maria Tuchet, who in 1594 married in secret.  Middle classes  The arrangements for marriage among the middle class varied according to the means of capital and property families had owned. Those of which had owned land followed similar pressure as the nobility, although to a lesser extent. The strategy of planning marriages ensured however much wealth the family possessed was preserved and would be passed through the inheritance. The custom of dowries and jointures was still prevalent, however, the economic resources exchanged were less in value. Although the children had some say in their choice of spouse for marriage, the custom of endogamy would rarely see one marry below their social standing. According to an account form Harrington regarding arranged marriages, he thought the method was not ‚Äúso heavy on the lower sort, being better able to shift for themselves, as upon the nobility and gentry‚Äù. Evidence suggests that in 1514 a Lancashire girl married a man she disliked, stating ‚Äúbut only for the fear of loss of my land I would never be with him an hour‚Äù. Similar to the higher classes, younger sons would have to make their own living before acquiring the means to get married and establish a family. This would be achieved through migrating to new towns or lands in search for employment opportunities. However, the eldest son would have stayed in the household of his upbringing and received an inheritance upon the death of the father.  Lower classes  The children of those who were at the bottom of society enjoyed considerable freedom in choosing their spouse. Between the ages of seven to fourteen, the children of the poor often left home in order to find employment. This was usually in the form of domestic servants, living-in laborers or apprenticeships, in which individuals would serve a master within a specific trade. After having accumulated sufficient funds that would maintain a family, they were able to make their own decisions regarding their choice of spouse. However, this resulted in the prospect of marriage being delayed, as it prolonged the necessity to stay within a trade and complete a term of apprenticeship. This saw the median age for marriage among the poor to be during their late twenties. It allowed couples to be financially equipped to establish a household. Women were required to support their husbands with their occupation and some even continued to work themselves as servants or wet nurses. The expectation was that the woman would run the household in the absence of the husband and bare his children. It was also vital for women to be equipped with domestic skills, as that saw them fulfilling the duties of an obedient wife Although interest in marriage among the wealthy was of great importance to family and kin, the incentive to interfere was limited among the lower classes. This was because the crucial component in controlling and arranging marriages required some form of exchange in property or other means of wealth. It meant that lower classes were not concerned with the custom of providing dowries and jointures, since contributions would be limited. Consequently, this lack of economic leverages allowed marriages among the poor to reflect a more personal affair, rather than a socially concentrated decision involving family and kin.  Courtship  Courtship describes a period intended for couples to get to know each other and develop personal affection, before deciding if a marriage should be pursued. The structure of courtship is surrounded by the economic possessions that could be brought into a potential marriage, whether that be of property, dowry, jointures or other settlements. The practice of exchanging gifts and tokens throughout the period of courting demonstrates the social importance of the stages leading towards marriage. Gifts accompanied courtship in the form of a man proving coins, trinkets or clothing to the woman he is trying to woo. These items represented not only personal matters but defined socially public relations, as these gifts of tokens were often brought by intermediaries who acted as witnesses to the ordeal. This is displayed in the case of William Hanwell, who assigned two pennies to an intermediary that would hand the gift over to his partner. It ensured if any form of contract (see Law section) were to take place, there would be a reliable witness that could properly testify. It was common for couples to express a form of acceptance towards each other, however, this could often lead to unintentional marriages arriving from courtship. According to the Records of Matrimonial Contract Litigation, in 1519 William Hanwell and his partner exchanged present consent. This was a form of contract that made the couple married instantaneously. It is evident from the records that the woman later challenged this marriage. However, two witnesses which were present during the consent were able to testify, which made the marriage legally binding.  Marriage   Crying the banns  A couple wishing to conduct a church ceremony would have to announce their intention to marry by ‚Äòcrying the banns‚Äô on three consecutive Sundays. This process allowed anyone with objections to come forth and declare reasons why the union should not proceed. A common reason involved a ‚Äòpre-contract‚Äô, where one of the partners was already promised to another person. If there were no obstacles, the Church provided its blessing, allowing the couple to pursue the wedding.  Procession  The wedding day proceeded with the arrival of the couple outside the church door, where the priest would initiate the service. During the ceremony, the couple took each other in marriage and promised to hold their vows until death do them part in both sickness and health. The woman additionally undertook an oath to obey her husband. Then the man would place the ring on the Bible, where it was blessed, before putting it on the woman‚Äôs right hand, on the fourth finger. After the couple received a blessing from the priest, they are pronounced husband and wife. Following this, the couple enter the church for nuptial mass to be performed. The couple would be kneeling before an altar, with a veil placed over their heads. The priest would then recite prayers over them and after finishing, would remove the veil. This meant the couple were officially married. The day would continue with celebrations, which included a wedding dinner and festive dancing. For couples that derived from lower classes, guests made gifts and could contribute to the ‚Äòbride ale‚Äô and entertainment. In order for a marriage to be considered legally binding, it had to be consummated. This could involve the couple being accompanied to bed by the priest and other witnesses. It ensure a testimony could be provided. They would then be left alone and have their privacy.  Law   Age of marriage  When a growing population of poverty caused by ‚Äúover-hasting marriages and over-soon setting up of households by the youth‚Äù., the decree of the Common Council of London in 1556 raised the age of consent to twenty-one. This aligned with the contemporary views that condemned those who had no means to establish and maintain their own household. The Act of 1901, also contributed to an increase in the average age of first marriage. It allowed overseers to apprentice children of the parish poor from the age of ten to twenty-four, essentially delaying the prospects of marriage. Although it was possible with parental permission for girls to marry at twelve and boys at fourteen, it was not usual for such marriages to occur.  Contracts  A marriage could be entered based on the contract of \\"per verba de prasenti\\". This involved the mutual exchange of present consent between a man and woman (‚ÄúI take thee as wife/ husband‚Äù). It was an indissoluble commitment, as regarded under ecclesiastical law. The second type of contract that made a marriage legally binding was per \\"verba de futuro\\". This was based on the mutual exchange of future consent made by two capable parties (‚ÄúI promise to take thee as wife/ husband‚Äù). If this promise was then followed by consummation, that marriage would become legitimate. However, if this consent was not followed by consummation, the marriage could be considered null and void. For this contract to be broken, both individuals must mutually agree to dissolve the marriage. It was essential for contracts to be witnessed, in order for the courts and civil lawyers to recognize a couple as legally married. A witness had to be present during the oral commitment, and in the case of ‚Äòfuture consent‚Äô, must be able provide a testimony that sexual intercourse had taken place.

She had a short naval career, serving on the St Helena and Malta stations. While on the Malta Station in 1819, she was instrumental in the apprehension of a British pirate vessel. The Navy sold Spey in 1822. She then was sold to the government of Gran Colombia and renamed Boyac√°. The vessel participated in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo in 1823, and took part in the capture of numerous Spanish vessels, including the Spanish frigate Ceres, in 1824. She was laid up in 1827, and thereafter disappears from naval records. Royal Navy Spey immediately went into Ordinary after launch. Then in 1814 Spey was under the command of Captain Hew Stewart. She received a double bottom to the line of flotation and was fitted for sea at Portsmouth between December 1814 and 7 February 1815. Captain George Fergusson commissioned her in December 1814, and she was fitted for foreign service at Woolwich between September and December 1815. Captain John Lake recommissioned her in October. On 15 November 1816 Captain James Arthur Murray was promoted to post captain and command of Spey.Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, p.117. He then sailed her for the Cape of Good Hope and St Helena. In 1818 she was under the command of Captain James Kearney White, and then on 12 August 1819 Captain Frederick Noel was promoted to post captain and command of Spey for the Mediterranean.Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, p.215. Capture of a pirate On 3 October the brig Frederick, under the command of Lieutenant Hobson, of Spey, brought the brig William, of Liverpool, into Malta with Delano, her master, and her entire crew (less the steward who had escaped), in chains. It was expected that Captain Delano and his men would be tried on 26 October at Malta for piracy and possibly murder, Williams mate being missing.\\"Ship News.\\" Times [London, England 3 Nov. 1819: 3.

Merchants in Malta requested assistance from the Royal Navy to chase William and apprehend the pirates. However, Spey was to sail to Genoa and was not ready for sea. The insurance companies in Malta hired Frederick to look for William. Noel contributed Lieutenant Hobson to command Frederick, and Spey and Racehorse also contributed a midshipman and 18 seamen to man Frederick. She had two men from Helen aboard and they identified William in the harbour at Smyrna. Hobson put his men into two boats, one towing the other, which was covered, and they rowed up to William, boarded her, and arrested the crew. Frederick and William arrived back at Malta on 3 October.\\"Piracies In The Mediterranean.\\" Times [London, England 5 Nov. 1819: 2. The Times Digital Archive.

The death sentence stipulated that William be painted black and towed out to the middle of the harbour of Valletta, and that the pirates be hanged on her. Captain Charles Christopher Delano and five of his men were hanged on 4 February 1820. The bodies were then taken down and those of Delano and three of his men were placed in gibbets erected at Fort Ricasoli. (The remaining two hanged pirates were buried below the gibbets.)\\"Malta Government Gazette, Feb. 2.\\" Times [London, England 1 Apr. 1820: 3. The Times Digital Archive.

Navy of Gran Colombia On 27 February 1821 the representative of the New Granada Patriots in London, Luis L√≥pez M√©ndez (the Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Minister of Venezuela), agreed to a loan of ¬£150,000 from the merchant James Mackintosh to cover the purchase of arms and equipment for 10,000 men, and three vessels. L√≥pez M√©ndez was not authorized to sign such an agreement and Mackintosh may have known it. The Colombia government never ratified the agreement.Rodriguez (2006), Vol. 1, pp.236‚Äì237. Mackintosh acquired three vessels, Tar√°ntula, Lady Boringdon, and Spey, and in 1822 sent them out. The Colombians initially refused to accept the cargo, but the fall of Maracaibo to the Royalists on 7 September 1822 caused them to change their minds. They then took the equipment and took over the three vessels for their navy. Tarantula appears to have retained her name, or perhaps was sent on her way. Lady Boringdon became Constituci√≥n and Spey Boyac√°. In 1823 Boyac√° participated in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo. Later in 1823 and 1824 she was a member of a small squadron under Rene Beluche that patrolled the Caribbean.

Background  Stone was born in Owingsville, Kentucky, to Henry L. and Pamela (Bourne) Stone. Due to her family's affluence, she attended private secondary schools in Owingsville and Mt. Sterling, then went on to study German at Wellesley College. After leaving Wellesley in 1887, she returned to Kentucky, where she became active in the Louisville chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Federation of Women's Clubs and served as the secretary of the Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs.  Hindman Settlement School  Stone met Katherine Pettit through the Federation of Women's Clubs in 1899. With Pettit, Stone spent three summers conducting a series of schools for the Federation near Hazard and Hindman, Kentucky, from 1899 to 1901. Local man Solomon Everage asked the two women to establish a school in the Troublesome Creek area, and, in 1902, with financing from the Women's Christian Temperance Union, Stone and Pettit co-founded Hindman Settlement School in Knott County, Kentucky. Stone was responsible for much of the administrative and financial work at the Hindman School and may have made many of the financial decisions at the school, or at least calculated the financial costs of new programs and activities. In 1912, Pettit left to found Pine Mountain Settlement School, but Stone remained on as principal. Under her leadership, the Hindman School taught courses in traditional academic subjects and industrial arts. Teachers offered medical clinics and helped improve other rural schools in Knott County. During the Depression, Stone even used her own wealth to keep the school functioning. Stone had a great interest in mountain handicrafts, collecting \\"coverlids\\" (coverlets), and was an expert in genealogy. She often told the local people around Hindman about how she could trace their relationships among each other.  Other service  Throughout her lifetime, Stone belonged to the Daughters of the War of 1812, the Daughters of the Confederacy, the Transylvanians, the Historical Societies of Virginia and Kentucky, the Filson Club of Louisville, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs.

Considered one of the best satires in Bengali literature, it satirizes \\"the practice and politics of vice-chancellorship and intellectual poverty\\" in Bangladeshi universities.  Background  The novel is based on a true story. The novel's protagonist Abu Zunayed, the vice chancellor of the premier university of the country, is based on Abdul Mannan who was the vice chancellor of Dhaka University from 1986 to 1990. Abdul Mannan used to keep a dairy cow which was killed amid factional clash among different student groups involved in politics. Sofa's Gabhi Bittanto presents a fictional account of that event.  Synopsis  The story of the novel revolves around chemistry professor Abu Zunayed, a newly appointed vice chancellor of the oldest and the most prestigious university of the country. In flash back, the narrator narrates that there was no chance Zunayed would be nominated for the VC panel, let alone get appointed in the position of VC, but he got nominated finally due to the influence and support of Zunayed's colleague young Dilruba Khanam, who manipulated her feminine charm to get others support Zunayed since she harbors grudge against the previous VC for some personal reason. Despite getting the lowest number of votes in the nomination, the country's president, who is also the University's chancellor, appoints Zunayed as the VC since Zunayed was thought to be someone who would be subservient to the regime reigning the country.

The ecoregion stretches over 2,000 km from the southern Ural mountains in the west to the foothills of Altai mountains in the east, yet averages only 200 km from south to north across its length. Because the region is farther inland than European forest steppe, and some 300 to 500 km farther north, the climate is more continental and with less precipitation the tree cover more sparse. The ecoregion is in the Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome, and the Palearctic realm, with a Humid Continental climate. It covers .  Location and description  The ecoregion stretches along the border between Russia and Kazakhstan, mostly on the northern (Russian) side, with a few small sections in Kazakhstan proper. The terrain is relatively flat lowland plains, with wetlands in the depressions and strips of trees following water courses on the sandy soil. To the north is the West Siberian taiga ecoregion; to the south is the Kazakh steppe.  Climate  The climate of the region is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by high variation in temperature, both daily and seasonally; with long, cold winters and short, cool summers with no month averaging over . There is just sufficient precipitation (averaging 330 mm/year) to support patchy stands of trees. The mean temperature at the center of the ecoregion is in January, and in July.  Flora and fauna  The region exhibits the typical forest steppe mix of grasslands and forest too sparse to create a full canopy. Typical trees are birch, aspen and pine, often growing in small groves called 'kolky', with the pine trees often growing in long strips of sandy soil in formations called 'ribbon forests'. Swamps are common. The region was about 15% forested; this has been reduced by human activity. The most common grass is Calamagrostis epigejos (bushgrass). A study in 2003 indicated that the small portion of the Kazakh forest steppe that is actually in Kazakhstan (about 21,000 Km2) shows cover that is 13% planted in spring wheat, 37% in dryland cropland/pasture, and 51% in a mosaic of cropland and forest.  Protections  There are two significant protected areas in the Kazakh forest steppe ecoregion; * Ilmen Nature Reserve, protecting an area of the Ilmensky Mountains on the southeast of the Ural mountains that has historically been the subject of intense mineral extraction, with over 400 former mines in the borders. * Tigireksky Nature Reserve, on the far eastern end of the ecoregion, at the foothills of the Altai-Sayan region, and transitioning into mountain-steppe habitats.

Background  The See of Tyre was the most prestigious archbishopric under the authority of the patriarchs of Antioch from the 5th century. The archbishops had more than a dozen suffragans, including the bishops of Acre, Beirut, Byblos, Sidon, Tripoli and Tortosa. The crusaders captured Tortosa (now Tartus in Syria) in 1102, Byblos in 1103, and Tripoli in 1109. In the late 1170s, William of Tyre wrote that Bernard of Valence, the Latin Patriarch of Antioch, had soon appointed Latin bishops to the three bishoprics. Documents written in the early 12th century did not refer to the bishops of the three dioceses, suggesting that the three sees, all located in the newly established crusader County of Tripoli, were actually left vacant. After King Baldwin I of Jerusalem captured Sidon and Beirut in 1110, Ghibbelin of Arles, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, convinced Baldwin I to ask Pope Paschal II to place the two sees and also the bishopric of Acre under the jurisdiction of the patriarchs of Jerusalem. Accepting the king's argumentation, the Pope ruled on 8 June 1111 that the boundaries of the ecclesiastical provinces should follow the political frontiers. Patriarch Bernard protested, but the Pope confirmed his decision, emphasizing his right to alter the boundaries of the patriarchates.  Establishment  Gormond of Picquigny signed a treaty with the Venetians about the joint conquest of Tyre on behalf of Baldwin II of Jerusalem in December 1123. The Patriarch had already consecrated a cleric, Odo, as the archbishop of Tyre, most probably because he wanted to prevent the Latin patriarch of Antioch from appointing his candidate to the see. Odo died before the crusaders and the Venetians captured Tyre on 7 July 1124.

The main objectives which underpinned the formation of this coalition were, to strengthen the solidarity between conservative parties, resolve pre-existing divisions, share resources in order to form a strong opposition, and administer an effective political campaign. It was envisioned that such efforts would also transfer to effectively convincing Ecuadorian voters of their intention to implement a more conservative economic agenda of free- market politics. Given that this would shift the direction of economic policy away from the statist, paternalistic model that guided that of the current, left-leaning administration, the coalition's political strategy in achieving this would prove vital.  Formation   Background and ideology  In 1983, the year in which in the political alliance was formed, Ecuador, like Latin America more generally, was facing immense political and economic challenges. Still recovering from a leftist military dictatorship that first assumed government control only seven years before, proceeding civil governments, including the current administration led by Jaime Roldos and Osvaldo Hurtado, still latched on to the statist and paternalistic ideology of its military predecessor.Hey, J. A. K. (1992). Theories of dependent foreign policy and the case of Ecuador during the Hurtado and Febres Cordero administrations, 1981-1988 (Unpublished doctoral thesis), University of Ohio State University, United States of America. This was most evident in how proceeding civil governments implemented economic policy. Particularly, initiatives designed to incentivise domestic production and decrease the country's mounting deficit. When electoral campaigns from both sides of the political divide began, the failure of such an approach was more than clear. Ecuador was enduring a stagnant economy spurred by underused industrial capacity, high employment, high inflation and substantial foreign debt. The current administration was also struggling with internal instability, compromising its ability to confidently pass measures to remedy the residual effects of ineffective fiscal management. As a coalition of conservative parties, the National Reconstruction Front posed a direct challenge to the statism which continued to dominate Ecuador's political landscape. Centralising their opposition around the potential of liberal economics in rescuing the Ecuadorian economy from further instability, their main strategy was to dramatically reduce the role of the state in shaping and ultimately improving Ecuador's fiscal outlook. Inspired by the ‚ÄòRegan Doctrine‚Äô,Farrington, C. (2012). New political spaces and public sphere 'deliberativeness' in Ecuador, 1822‚Äî2011. International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society, 25 (1/3), 15-33. such a strategy also prompted an attempt to introduce neoliberalism as a measure of anti-communist resistance. The coalition believed such efforts would rejuvenate Ecuadorian politics from the inside by slowly eradicating a culture of corruption and consequently, addressing a lack of trust on behalf of the Ecuadorian people. Given the social and economic instability brought about by previous state driven economic programs, It was also believed that minimising the role of the state in public affairs and economic policy would be a more effective means of lifting domestic productivity.  Establishment and growth  In the elections of 1984, leader of the Social Christian Party, Le√≥n Febres-Cordero was the presidential candidate of Ecuador's political right wing, represented by the National Reconstruction Front. The National Reconstruction Front was a unifying political force which aimed to strengthen Ecuador's liberal right wing by absorbing pre-existing right-winged parties under its umbrella. This was the motivation which convinced the coalition's founder, congressman and president of the conservative Social Christian Party, Le√≥n Febres Cordero to form the party in the first place. Despite sharing a politically liberal economic vision which prioritised the autonomy of financial institutions as a means of securing a healthy national economy, the coalition's establishment and growth was not immediate. The division of participating parties prior to the formation of the coalition was due to salient differences which defined the diversity of Ecuador's political right wing. Of importance to the historical trajectory of the coalition in achieving its political objectives is the decisive role of Guayaquil businessmen. They were crucial in defining the neoliberal policies which distinguished the coalition from its left wing opposition during the election and after the coalition was elected in 1984. Ultimately, the heterogeneous composition of the coalition and the political influence of the Guayaquil businessmen would present would affect the coalition's political success, particularly during the coalition's four year electoral term between 1984‚Äì8.Torre, C. d. l., & Striffler, S. (2008). The Ecuador reader: History, culture, politics. Durham: Duke University Press. This was in part due to the political differences which originally defined each participating party but also, the pressures of Ecuador's political climate at that time. In retrospect, the coalition demonstrates the difficulty of implementing an alternative political and economic paradigm within a political climate which historically has been institutionally and culturally defined by the authority of state in deciding the outcome of public and private affairs. Such a challenge, particularly its inherent structural pressures, highlighted the divisions between each participating party, reinforcing the gap between rhetoric and practice.  1984 elections   Campaign and results  The National Reconstruction made its first public appearance in the lead up to first-round balloting which took place in January 1984. As the leader of the coalition, Le√≥n Febres Cordero delivered the coalition's objectives to the public. Declaring the coalition agenda as \\"more Reagan than Mitterrand\\", Febres Cordero positioned the coalition in stark contrast to the statist government proposed by the successor of Oswaldo Hurtado‚Äôs Christian Democrats, Rodrigo Borja. He attacked the intervention of the state in economic affairs, promising to cut government spending and suggesting that granting unfettered freedom to the business sector would produce the economic growth that Ecuador needed to avoid further instability and repay foreign debt. Such rhetoric was thought to be a campaign strategy for harbouring the support of the disenfranchised business sector which felt left out of the current leftist, interventionist government. Indeed, Febres Cordero hoped to make the business sector the coalition's main supporter during the election. However, as the Bolivian experience demonstrated, the business sector votes in order to protect their economic interests rather than to maintain political alliances. Febres Cordero seemed to have underestimated the impact of this behaviour in securing a majority during first-round balloting. Defining the coalition's political objectives according to the interests of a disenfranchised business sector, which was also a small yet highly politicized faction of Ecuadorian civil society, failed to win a majority. The National Reconstruction Front came in second to the leftist campaign led by Rodrigo Borja. The results of the first-round ballot indicated to the National Reconstruction front that they needed to expand their support base. Such a shift in political strategy implied compromising the delivery of a bold neoliberal program by appealing to the interests of left-wing voters or those who considered themselves centrist. As the coalition prepared for the second and final ballot in May, 1984, Febres Cordero began to promote a populist political mandate which see-sawed between the statist populism upheld by his opponent and the hard-line neoliberalism which prompted the coalition's initial campaign objectives. Febres Cordero adopted the slogan \\"pan techo y empleo\\" (bread, shelter and jobs) as a means of public announcing the coalition's strategic move towards a more centrist position ‚Äì a move which ultimately made the coalition's campaign objectives appear contradictory. After initially seeking to defend the economic interests of Guayaquil businessmen, one the coalition's key members, the coalition now promised to secure basic salaries, increase spending in public housing and \\"be at the defence of employment\\". Ironically, these campaign promises depended on restating the role of the state in economic affairs, a key principle of the statist economy that preceded the coalition and which inspired the coalition's political campaign in the first place. Such zig-ziging also affected the internal unity of the coalition, particularly the support of the Guayaquil businessmen. As the coalition's main instigator, the coalition's decision to advance a populist agenda during their electoral campaign compromised their commitment to promoting benefits and projected outcomes of the neoliberal policies the party intended to enforce if elected. Despite these challenges, the coalition's reformed political strategy and subsequent political manoeuvring proved advantageous during the second and final round of balloting. The National Reconstruction Front was elected with 52 percent of the vote on May 6, 1984. Even though the coalition had strayed away from their hard-line neoliberal mandate, the elections marked a significant and historical swing against the socially and politically embedded interventionist agenda that had up until now, shaped Ecuador's political identity.  Challenges and Success  Crude oil continues to be Ecuador's largest export and contributor to national GDP. Efforts to diversify the income stream from national products was a political strategy used by the National Reconstruction Front to strengthen domestic productivity. Once in power, the Febres Cordero administration learnt the difficulties of implementing a neoliberal agenda in a political context where paternalism was culturally expected by the nation's business sector, and was the political identity against which the international business community assessed Ecuador as a potential economic partner. Also, the populist political mandate which placed the coalition in a leading position during the second half of their electoral campaign was not sufficiently effective in securing a majority in congress. Here the coalition held a minority of seats. Another obstacle facing the coalition was implementing the expansive political mandate promoted by its political leader and therefore, maintaining the support it generated from different sections of Ecuadorian society. After their mandate for a free-market revolution failed to appeal to a majority of voters, the coalition responded to these political and economic challenges by continuing to see- saw between the imperatives of liberal economics and the practicalities of traditional Latin American statism. This had devastating consequences for the coalition's unity, creating splinter groups which further compromised the front's opportunities for progress. Despite these setbacks, the coalition achieved a number of significant liberal economic reforms during its term. These included, opening up the national economy to foreign investors. This was particularly evident in Ecuador's mining sector. The coalition withdrew Ecuador from the Andean Pact which protected the mining and natural resource industries of partner countries from exploitation by insisting member nations incur income tax from the profits made by investors. The intention behind this mutual agreement was to increase the productivity of member states in a manner which encouraged sustainable economic practice with foreign companies. By withdrawing Ecuador from the pact, foreign investors would gain autonomy over how they distributed profits made from mining activities, meaning that potential investors could obtain a better return from invested capital. Febres Cordero insisted that relaxing the conditions of investment in this manner would make Ecuador more attractive business partner. Another significant achievement was increasing domestic productivity by allowing non-traditional domestic markets to benefit from free-market exchange. It was hoped that deregulating the nation's domestic business sector would stabilise the economy by increasing national productivity, tackling unemployment, all of which could ultimately result in a budget surplus. Despite the fact that crude oil continued to be Ecuador's main export product, non-traditional exports significantly contributed to the country's GDP during the coalition's term. Between 1983 and 1986, Febres Cordero claimed that non-traditional exports raised GDP by an average rate of 3.9 percent. These initiatives demonstrated the government's efforts towards increasing opportunities for greater economic sustainability as they opening new domestic markets which would promote domestic productivity and employment, as well as increase the income stream from exported goods. Such efforts also reinforced the coalition's neoliberal agenda and given its impact in promoting economic growth, it also positioned the coalition's political platform as viable alternative to that promoted by the preceding, statistic and interventionist government.

Construction of today's church started around 1100 and since then it has undergone both expansions and major restorations, most recently in 2010. The church is built of stone and can accommodate 320 people. The church can be reached via a popular tourist route along Norwegian County Road 120. Ownership The first church at Enebakk was built at the order of the king and the clergy, and was probably funded by gifts and income from royal and ecclesiastical taxes on commoners. Around 1125, Sigurd the Crusader introduced a tithe. Many farms in Enebakk paid this directly to the church. In 1152 the opportunity was introduced to will gifts to the church. With the Reformation in 1536, the king took over all the church property and the churches themselves. When Frederick IV experienced financial difficulties after the Great Northern War (1700‚Äì1721), he started selling churches to procure cash. There were several different owners of Enebakk Church as a result: * In 1723, the king sold the church to Matias Rosenberg for 705 riksdaler. * In 1749, Rosenberg sold it to Nils Bechman for 2,300 riksdaler. * In 1753, Bechman it sold to Lieutenant Colonel Michelet and chief forest officer Clemmet Hansen at the √òstenb√∏l farm for 2,576 riksdaler. * In 1756, Michelet sold his half for 1,636 riksdaler to Hansen, and he became the sole owner. The owners of the farm √òstenb√∏l owned the church until 1880. They also owned Mari Church from 1764 onward. * In 1880, the municipality of Enebakk bought both churches for NOK 14,000. History The first church at Enebakk was built of wood on a plot south of the houses on the Krogsb√∏l farm. The church was built at the beginning of Norway's Christian era, possibly following the order of Olaf II. Circa 1100 The next church that was built stood out in the landscape because of its size. The church had already been a gathering center in the village for almost 80 years, and it is believed to have been very large for local circumstances. The walls were over two ells () thick, the nave was 30 ells () long and 20 ells () wide, and the walls 12 ells () high. The chancel is believed to have been be 9 ells () both ways and 9 ells high. The church was built of stone, and the construction of the chancel and nave used of stone. Much of this stone was quarried from a hill northwest of the church. Building with stone and mortar had been unknown in Norway until this time. This construction technique came to the country with Christianity, and only churches, monasteries, bishops' residences, and the king's residence were built in this way in the early years. Limestone for binder had to be quarried, burned, and slaked for up to seven years. It was of good quality; it solidified slowly, but became hard as stone. The foundation was dug deep into the hill and was 1.5 times as wide as the wall above ground level. The outer stones were large and even, and pebbles and mortar were laid in the middle of the wall. The north wall is slightly curved. Limestone was used for the corners and around the portal because it was easier to shape into plain surfaces and patterns. This stone probably came from the Oslo area. Construction work could only take place in the summer, and is believed to have involved three or four masonry teams with five or six men on each team. Considering the scope of the project, there were probably 35 men and two or three horses working at the site every day. The church had an earthen floor. There may have been no other furnishings than the altar and the baptismal font. The limestone altarpiece stood on a walled plinth of gray stone against the east wall of the chancel. The baptismal font made of soapstone stood furthest west in the nave, probably to the right of the front door when entering the church. In various places on the walls, sun crosses were painted, which were a fertility symbol. Dedication Enebakk Church was dedicated to Saint Botwulf on Saint Gregory's Day, March 12. The event was mentioned in Bishop Eystein's Land Book from 1393, where the church was referred to as Ignebakka kirkia. In 1104 it was 500 years since Pope Gregory had died. Such a major celebration took place that year that it is reasonable to assume that this was the year the church was dedicated, and that the ceremony took place on March 12, 1104. Circa 1200 The church's tower was built around 1200. It was probably built higher than the ridge of the nave, and it was covered by a four-sided sloping roof. The vestibule at the base of the tower in front of the entrance is called the v√•penhuset, or the place to store weapons. Any weapons were placed here before entering the church. Next to the entrance door in the base of the tower there is a small hole in the wall on the left side. This is Norway's oldest \\"mailbox.\\" Messages (and later bidding sticks) from the king and bishop were placed here by a messenger. Later, the letters were read by the priest from the pulpit or from the church hill after the worship service. In the south wall of the vestibule a small square niche is cut into the wall. An altar stood here during the Catholic era, and the public had access to it when there was no service in the church. Catholic churches commonly have several small alters, as was also the case at Enebakk during the Catholic era. Outlaws The door on the east side of the nave has wrought- iron fittings in a Gothic design, perhaps from the same time as the tower was built. In the middle there is a ring. It has the form of two dragons biting the handle and their tails are braided together. If anyone that was outlawed fled to the church and held this ring, nobody could harm him. Weights and measures There is an iron rod hanging in the porch. It is an ell (alen), long. Earlier, a standard weight also hung here, but it is now gone. The standards served as references where the measuring units could be checked. Circa 1500 Around 1500, the church was in poor condition: the upper part of the tower and the east gable had collapsed. The walls were cracking and the ceiling was deteriorating. The period after the Black Death (1349‚Äì1350) was marked by a decline. Only a third of the population survived the epidemic, and there were few funds to maintain the church. A request for assistance was sent to highest authorities. The church even sold letters of indulgence to raise money until they were banned as a result of the Reformation in 1536. Eventually funds were obtained and extensive repairs were carried out, and the building largely acquired the appearance it has today. The east gable above the nave was restored with red brick, and the cracks in the walls were repaired. A new roof was laid over the entire church. The entire roof was covered with wooden shakes, then spread with tar. Each shake was about long and wide, and the edge at one end sloped down. The shakes were fastened with wooden pegs, and there were about 40,000 shakes altogether, all of which had been split with an ax. Vestry A vestry was built on the north side of the chancel. It has the same length as the chancel, but is a little narrower. Originally there were two windows in the vestry, one to the north and one to the east. Later the east window was made larger and a door was installed. Because the vestry was used to store valuables, the door was made of small plates of iron equipped with a strong lock. The iron was smelted from bog iron. Lead roof The church was given lead roofing before 1600. The lead sheets were cast in wooden molds lined with sand. The lead sheets were large (about ) and heavy (), and they were prone to sagging and causing leaks. In 1787, the roof was replaced with blue glazed Dutch tile. New tower The top of the tower was not re-walled again. Instead, the roof over the nave was extended and passed over the tower at the same height. A square bell tower was built over the roof, and above it was a tall tower. The beams of the tower are dated to 1551. It is the oldest wooden tower on a stone church in Norway. It is possible that at that time the tower more or less received the shape it has today, but the belfry had four small corner towers. Since then, the tower has undergone several major repairs, and the four corner towers were removed. The walls also had to be repaired, including the installation of large iron anchors that can still be seen in the west wall of the tower. Spire The top of the tower is decorated with a ball and a spire with a rooster and an iron flag with the year 1885. In Norse mythology, the rooster represented salvation from the powers of darkness when it announced dawn and sunrise. It was also thought that the rooster was protection against lightning strikes. In the Christian context, there is a rooster that \\"awakened\\" Apostle Peter. The ball symbolizes the globe. The height from the ground to top of the spire is , about the same as the total length of the church. In 1884 the tower was paneled and painted black, and in 1890 it was painted white. During the restoration of 1966, the tower was painted black with white corner posts and white windows. 1966 restoration The last major restoration of the church took place in 1966, after the floors were taken up in 1965. The earthen floor is about below the current wooden floor. A recess for a tomb was found in the middle of the nave. Some coins were also found, some remains of the lead roof, and some loose stones. During the 1966 restoration, several church frescoes (kalkmalerier) were also revealed. These are visible in the church over the gallery, on the northeast wall, and on the chancel arch. The stoves and chimneys were removed, and electrical heating with heating pipes was installed under each pew. New electric lights were also installed throughout the church. Furnishings Bells In the bell tower there are now three bells, a large one in the middle and a smaller one on each side. The largest bell is from the Middle Ages marked with a sun cross. It was probably acquired when the tower was built. The southern bell dates from 1682 and it bears a crucifix, Christian V's monogram, and inscriptions. One of the inscriptions reads \\"Alene Gud √¶ren. Til Guds √¶re meg st√∏pte Fridrich Meyer.\\" (Glory to God alone. Fridrich Meyer cast me for the glory of God.) On March 17, 1716, a Swedish detachment of Charles XII's soldiers took the large bell. However, Norwegian dragoons apprehended them and reinstalled the bell. The third bell was purchased by the municipality at an auction in Vestby, possibly in 1836, where it had been a farm bell. It would be used for funerals of the poor, paupers quartered at farms by the parish, and small farmers, without payment. During restoration work in 1966, the tin plates on the tower were removed and replaced with copper plates. The belfry was again painted black with white corner posts and white windows. Altar The altar during the earliest stage of the church was a large altar stone with a sepulchrum in the middle. In the sepulchrum there was a relic of St. Botwulf until the end of the Catholic era. When the altar was in use, the sepulchrum was covered with a square piece of stone and the edge was sealed with lead. This stone altar was replaced with a wooden table in 1608. The altar stone was used in 1708 as a stone over a grave inside the church, bearing the year 1708 and a coat of arms, with the inscription ...dater. This was presumably the grave of Johanne Mathiesdatter Skulberg (1620‚Äì1708, married name Johanne Holmsen Buer), who was buried in the church; she was the widow of the bailiff (lensmann) Hans Holmsen Buer (1617‚Äì1697). When the grave was removed, the slab was taken to the √òstenb√∏l farm, where the owners of the church lived. It was laid in front of the kitchen staircase as a flagstone threshold. At that time or later, it broke into two parts, and the smaller part was placed in the foundation of the barn ramp. Later the second part also ended up there. During restoration work in 1966, the pieces were collected and reassembled in the church's porch. The panels of the wooden altar, installed in 1608, had three successive layers of various decorations. The last two layers were removed during restoration in 1966 so that the oldest decoration appeared. Only the lower square part of the wooden altar dates from 1608. This includes a catechism panel with the Lord's Prayer, the Words of Institution, and the Ten Commandments. They are written in blackletter. In 1667 the altar was built larger and received more decoration. Christopher Ridder executed the woodcarving, and the portraitist J√∏rgen Schult painted it. On a black background just above the middle is a five-line inscription stating that Christen Eskildsen paid for the decoration in honor of his second wife, Sofie Christensdatter Bing. Christen Eskildsen was a well-established merchant in Christiania. He owned the Flateby farm and founded the Flateby estate by buying up many of the surrounding farms. The initials of the parish priest Jens Andersen and his wife Anna Hansdatter Kraft are written on small fields, as well as the initials and coat of arms of Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenl√∏ve, and King Frederik III's monogram and royal motto Dominus providebit (The Lord will provide). Below this is a depiction of the crucifixion, flanked by Mary and John. The decorated panel was removed from the church around 1730 and placed in the attic, perhaps because of its lush angelic figures (under the influence of Pietism). The panel remained in the ceiling until the 1870s. It was then moved to the √òstenb√∏l farm and placed in the loft in the barn. On June 28, 1906, Asbj√∏rn Oppegaard purchased the panel at auction for NOK 100 and gave it back to the church. That year, the Enebakk savings bank also donated NOK 400 to restore the panel, and the outlay for its purchase was also refunded by the bank. In 1907, the Municipality of Enebakk allocated NOK 500 for the painter Carl Lunde to restore the altar, bringing the total expenditure for restoration to NOK 900. The altar table has two brass candlesticks from 1661 that were given to the church by Johan Hagemeister and Kristin Anderdatter Karre. Pulpit The pulpit's sounding board dates from 1578 and is the oldest in Norway. It has an inscription from John 3.16: (For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 1578). This sounding board probably originally hung over the baptismal font. However, when the baptismal font was removed from the church in 1703, the fixture was out of place. The owner of the church hung it over his own chair. When the municipality assumed ownership of the church in 1880, the fixture was placed in the attic; it was taken down again and installed over the pulpit in 1907. The pulpit in its present form dates from 1667. The churchwarden and bailiff Abraham B√∏hler ordered the new pulpit and arranged for it and the altar table to be painted. However, he did not obtain the approval of the parish priest, Laurits Christophersen Thue. Therefore, the parish priest filed a case against B√∏hler to have the church's money refunded, but without success. The ornaments were carved by Christopher Ridder, and the decoration was painted by J√∏rgen Schult. The main panel on the pulpit shows Christ in a red robe as the savior of the world, with a globe in His hand. The panel to the left shows John the Baptist with a banner. The panel furthest to the right shows an angel holding the Veil of Veronica. The motif originated in the legend of Saint Veronica, who dried the sweat of Jesus' brow at the crucifixion with her veil, and the image of His face was miraculously impressed upon it. Below the image to the right is written C.Anset (possibly 'the face of Christ'). Baptismal font The baptismal font is the oldest and only part of the original inventory that is still in use. It is carved from a single block of soapstone. The vessel is approximately in diameter, and its volume is approximately . The color of the stone indicates that it came from the Marker or Aremark area. At the bottom of the vessel there is a hole that could be closed with a stopper so that the baptismal water could be released onto the former earthen floor after the ceremony (water that was blessed could not be discarded outside the church). Today a brass basin is used for baptisms. The church acquired a small basin in 1691, and a larger one in 1748. Both probably date from the 16th century. The small one was stolen from the church in 1999. The large one is as decorated with a central scene showing the fall of man surrounded by bands with deer. The baptismal canopy dates from 1713. It was carved by Nicolai Borg. Around the edge there are four angels, and below is a copy of the dove hanging under the pulpit's sounding board because it was previously used as the baptismal canopy. Pews The pews in Enebakk Church were installed in 1634, and they are the oldest church pews that are in regular use in Norway. Before that it is believed that there were only stools along the walls for those that needed them most. The pews have finely carved end boards. Near the top there is a black field where the names of the farms in Enebakk are written. Each farm name was written on two pews, one on the north side of the church and one on the south side. The north side (on the left when entering the church) was the female side, and the south side was the male side. A total of 126 different farm names are written on the end boards along the aisle, probably for all of the inhabited farms that belonged to the parish. The original \\"pews\\" in the church were simply stringers with a backrest. At the top there was a rail, and the parishioners stood and rested their elbows against the rail. Later a narrow seat was added, but then the rail got in the way of the back, and so it was removed and used to make the seats wider. The narrow rail at the back of the seat is profiled on the underside. On the front pew on the north side is written Den Hellige Daab Samt Inden For Hr Sogneprestens Families Stoel (Holy baptism and the seat for the parish priest's family), and on the back pew on the north side is written No 16 Gamle Og Schr√∏belige Huu≈ø-mens Qvinder (No. 16, Old and feeble tenant women). Organ The church has had several organs. One bishop mentioned after a visitation on August 29, 1812: \\"The singing in the church was excellent, which was contributed to the newly installed organ or positive, donated to the church by War Commissar [Jonathan Julius] Aars, and the installation paid for by Pastor Aars, and outfitted with one stop.\\" In 1877, the church received a new mechanical organ with six stops. This was built by the German company E. F. Walker & Cie in Ludwigsburg. That organ was removed in 1975 and replaced with a new one. The 1975 organ was Norway's first organ with classical stops in the tradition of the 18th-century Baroque. It is completely pure-tuned in F major. The organ has 16 stops divided into two manuals and pedals. It is composed of 1,072 individual organ pipes, of which 42 are wooden pipes. The organ is well suited for concerts, and especially for compositions by the old masters. The new organ was consecrated on December 14, 1975. It was built by the company Gebr√ºder Jehmlich Orgelbau in Dresden. The total cost of the organ was NOK 224,000. The Enebakk Madonna Next to the south door of the church there is a plaster cast of the Enebakk Madonna; the original is now in the antiquities collection at the Museum of Cultural History. The statue and the crucifix over the chancel arch probably originally came from Tenor Church in Slitu in Eidsberg. This is stated by the parish priest Jacob Nicolai Wilse in a book from 1791. Tenor Church was closed before the Reformation in 1536 and deteriorated. Any decoration that was left was taken to the nearby farm; during the Reformation, the decoration was removed from all of the churches. Ingeborg Olsdatter Eidsberg (1595‚Äì1661) may have brought the crucifix and Madonna when she moved to Enebakk in 1616. The descendants of Holm Hansen Ekeberg (1585‚Äì1645) and Ingeborg Olsdatter Eidsberg at the √òstenb√∏l farm later became the owners of Enebakk Church. When the altar was taken down and placed in the attic around 1750, it is possible that the crucifix was given to the church and hung on the wall above the altar and that the Madonna came with it at the same time. The crucifix and the Madonna are some of the most ancient medieval art in Norway. They are believed to have been created around 1240. The Madonna has a smiling face reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The statue was apparently sent to the antiquities collection at the Museum of Cultural History for repair in the late 19th century, after which nobody asked for it to be returned and the museum thus retained the statue. The museum has insured the Madonna stature for NOK 6 million. Frescoes The church's old financial accounts mention frescoes (kalkmalerier), but they were covered by whitewash around 1600. During the 1966 restoration, investigations were carried out and remains of decorations were found under the layers of whitewash. The oldest frescoes were found on the east wall in the chancel behind the altar. There are the remains of a layer of wax with traces of colors. This indicates that the chancel was partially decorated in the Middle Ages. Over the course of time, the walls were whitewashed approximately 30 times and colors were found around layer no. 15. Below the decorations there are also about 15 layers of whitewash. This made the effort to reveal the decorations very difficult and time consuming. The oldest fresco is a scene on the chancel arch. This humorous image depicts a woman churning butter. She is wearing a dress with a ruff collar and a beret on her head, clothing that was usual around 1540. Around her stand three fanciful devils that are helping her. This illustrates an old superstition that it was possible to summon devils to make butter faster. Similar images are also found in Danish and Finnish church frescoes. When this fresco was painted it was the height of the witch trials, which may have contributed to the context. It was believed that witches received help from the devil to retrieve cream from their neighbors so they were never without butter. One devil has a bucket on his tail. Above the fresco is the inscription Superbia 'pride'. In the Catholic Church, 'pride' was the most serious of the seven deadly sins. On the other side of the chancel it is likely that the Humilitas 'humility' was depicted. Here, however, the plaster fell from the wall and was later repaired. Other frescoes in the church depict vines, scenes from biblical stories, and people. During the restoration in 1966, remnants of a painted lozenge patterns were found in the sacristy. The entire room has been repainted with this design. The same decoration is found at Nyborg Castle in Denmark. The painted cruciform flowers, which are found in the decoration in all three rooms in the church, were widely used in sculpture, painting, and artwork in the Middle Ages. Election church Enebakk Church served as an election church () in 1814. Together with about 300 churches across Norway, it was a venue for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly. These were Norway's first national elections. Millennium site In connection with the turn of the millennium, the church was chosen as the municipality of Enebakk's millennium site. 1974 burglary The church was broken into and items were stolen in 1974. The items lost included a pyx from 1710, a chalice and paten, 24 communion cups, two small candlesticks, and two small jars, all of silver.

These include organisms in the microbial mat, free floating cells, or bacteria in an endosymbiotic relationship with animals. Chemolithoautotrophic bacteria derive nutrients and energy from the geological activity at Hydrothermal vents to fix carbon into organic forms. Viruses are also a part of the hydrothermal vent microbial community and their influence on the microbial ecology in these ecosystems is a burgeoning field of research. Hydrothermal vents are located where the tectonic plates are moving apart and spreading. This allows water from the ocean to enter into the crust of the earth where it is heated by the magma. The increasing pressure and temperature forces the water back out of these openings, on the way out, the water accumulates dissolved minerals and chemicals from the rocks that it encounters. There are generally three kinds of vents that occur and are all characterized by its temperature and chemical composition. Diffuse vents release clear water typically up to 30 ¬∞C. White smoker vents emit a milky coloured water that are approximately 200-330 ¬∞C, black smoker vents generally release water hotter than the others between 300-400 ¬∞C. The waters from black smokers are darkened by the precipitates of sulfide that are accumulated. Due to there not being any sunlight at these ocean depths, energy is provided by chemosynthesis where symbiotic bacteria and archaea form the bottom of the food chain and are able to support a variety of organisms such as Riftia pachyptila and Alvinella pompejana. These organisms utilize this symbiotic relationship in order to utilize and obtain the chemical energy that is released at these hydrothermal vent areas.  Environmental Properties  leftAlthough there is a large variation in temperatures at the surface of the water with the changing depths of the thermocline seasonally, the temperatures underneath the thermocline and the waters near the deep sea are relatively constant. There aren‚Äôt any changes that are brought about by seasonal effects or annual changes. These temperatures stay in the range of 0-3 ¬∞C with the exception of the waters immediately surrounding the hydrothermal vents which can get as high as 407 ¬∞C. These waters are prevented from boiling due to the pressure that is acting upon it at those depths. With increasing depth, the effects of pressure start to occur. The pressure is due to the weight of water above pushing down. The approximate rate of pressure increase in the ocean is 10Mega-pascals (MPa) for every kilometre that is traveled towards the seafloor. This means that hydrostatic pressure can reach up to 110MPa at the depths of the trenches. Salinity stay relatively constant within the deep seas communities around the world at 35parts per thousand (ppt). There is no light in the hydrothermal vent environment so there are no organisms that can create energy from photosynthesis. Instead, the energy that the majority of organisms utilize comes from chemosynthesis. The organisms utilize the minerals and chemicals that come out of the vents.  Adaptations  Extreme conditions in the hydrothermal vent environment mean that microbial communities that inhabit these areas need to adapt to them. Microbes that live here are known to be hyperthermophiles, microorganisms that grow at temperatures above 90 ¬∞C. These organisms are found where the fluids from the vents are expelled and mixed with the surrounding water. These hyperthermophilic microbes are thought to contain proteins that have extended stability at higher temperatures due to intramolecular interactions but the exact mechanisms are not clear yet. The stabilization mechanisms for DNA are not as unknown and the denaturation of DNA are thought to be minimized through high salt concentrations, more specifically Mg, K, and PO4 which are highly concentrated in hyperthermophiles. Along with this, many of the microbes have proteins similar to histones that are bound to the DNA and can offer protection against the high temperatures. Microbes are also found to be in symbiotic relationships with other organisms in the hydrothermal vent environment due to their ability to have a detoxification mechanism which allows them to metabolize the sulfide-rich waters which would otherwise be toxic to the organisms and the microbes.  Microbial Biogeochemistry   Introduction  A diagram showing the process of how seawater becomes a part of the hydrothermal effluent including the elements that are added and precipitated.Microbial communities at hydrothermal vents mediate the transformation of energy and minerals produced by geological activity into organic material. Organic matter produced by autotrophic bacteria is then used to support the upper trophic levels. The hydrothermal vent fluid and the surrounding ocean water is rich in elements such as iron, manganese and various species of sulfur including sulfide, sulfite, sulfate, elemental sulfur from which they can derive energy or nutrients. Microbes derive energy by oxidizing or reducing elements. Different microbial species utilize different chemical species of an element in their metabolic processes. For example, some microbe species oxidize sulfide to sulfate and another species will reduce sulfate to elemental sulfur. As a result, a web of chemical pathways mediated by different microbial species transform elements such as carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen, from one species to another. Their activity alters the original chemical composition produced by geological activity of the hydrothermal vent environment.  Carbon Cycle  Geological activity at hydrothermal vents produce an abundance of carbon compounds. Hydrothermal vent plumes contain high concentrations of methane and carbon monoxide with methane concentration reaching 107 times of the surrounding ocean water. Deep ocean water is also a large reservoir of carbon and concentration of carbon dioxide species such as dissolved CO2 and HCO3‚àí around 2.2mM. The bountiful carbon and electron acceptors produced by geological activity support an oasis of chemoautotrophic microbial communities that fix inorganic carbon, such as CO2, using energy from sources such as oxidation of sulfur, iron, manganese, hydrogen and methane. These bacteria supply a large portion of organic carbon that support heterotrophic life at hydrothermal vents.  Carbon Fixation  Carbon fixation is the incorporation of inorganic carbon into organic matter. Unlike the surface of the planet where light is a major source of energy for carbon fixation, hydrothermal vent chemolithotrophic bacteria rely on chemical oxidation to obtain the energy required. Fixation of CO2 is observed in members of gammaproteobacteria, epsilonproteobacteria, alphaproteobacteria, and members of Archaea domain at hydrothermal vents. Four major metabolic pathways for carbon fixation found in microbial vent communities include the Calvin‚ÄìBenson‚ÄìBassham (CBB) cycle, reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) cycle and reductive acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) pathway. = Carbon Fixation Metabolic Pathways = Calvin-Benson- Bassham cycle (CBB) The Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle is the most common CO2 fixation pathway found among autotrophs. The key enzyme is ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). RuBisCO has been identified in members of the microbial community such as Thiomicrospira, Beggiatoa, zetaproteobacterium, and gammaproteobacterial endosymbionts of tubeworms, bivalves, and gastropods. Reductive Carboxylic Acid Cycle (rTCA) The Reductive Carboxylic Acid Cycle (rTCA) is the second most commonly found carbon fixation pathway at hydrothermal vents. rTCA cycle is essentially a reversed TCA or Kreb cycle heterotrophs use to oxidize organic matter. Organism that use the rTCA cycle prefer to inhabit anoxic zones in the hydrothermal vent system because some enzymes in the rTCA cycle are sensitive to the presence of O2. It is found in sulfate reducing deltaproteobacterium such as some members of Desulfobacter, Aquificales and Aquifex and Thermoproteales. 3-HP and 3-HP/4-HB cycles The key enzymes of 3-HP and 3-HP/4-HB cycles are acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase, malonyl-CoA reductase and propionyl-CoA synthase. Most of the organisms that use this pathway are mixotrophs with the ability to utilize organic carbon in addition to carbon fixation. Reductive Acetyl CoA pathway The Reductive Acetyl CoA pathway has only been found in chemoautotrophs. This pathway does not require ATP as the pathway is directly coupled to the reduction of H2. Organisms that have been found with this pathway prefer H2 rich areas. Species include deltaproteobacterium such as Dulfobacterium autotrophicum, acetogens and methanogenic Archaea.  Methane Metabolism  Hydrothermal vents produce high quantities of methane which can originate from both geological and biological processes. Methane concentrations in hydrothermal vent plumes can exceed 300¬µM in concentration depending on the vent. In comparison, the vent fluid contains 106 ‚Äì 107 times more methane than the surrounding deep ocean water, of which methane ranges between 0.2-0.3nM in concentration. Microbial communities utilize the high concentrations of methane as an energy source and a source of carbon. Methanotrophy, where a species uses methane both as an energy and carbon source, have been observed with the presence of gammaproteobacteria in the Methylococcaceae lineages. Methanotrophs convert methane into carbon dioxide and organic carbon. They are typically characterized by the presence of intercellular membranes and microbes with intercellular membranes were observed to make up 20% of the microbial mat at hydrothermal vents. = Methane Oxidation = Energy generation via methane oxidation yields the next best source of energy after sulfur oxidation. It has been suggested that microbial oxidation facilitates rapid turnover at hydrothermal vents, thus much of the methane is oxidize within short distance of the vent. In hydrothermal vent communities, aerobic oxidation of methane is commonly found in endosymbiotic microbes of vent animals. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is typically coupled to reduction of sulfate or Fe and Mn as terminal electron acceptors as these are most plentiful at hydrothermal vents. AOM is found to be prevalent in marine sediments at hydrothermal vents and may be responsible for consuming 75% of methane produced by the vent. Species that perform AOM include Archaea of phyllum Crenarchaeota and Thermococcus. = Methanogenesis = Production of methane through methanogenesis can be from degradation of hydrocarbons, from reaction of carbon dioxide or other compounds like formate. Evidence of methanogenesis can be found alongside of AOM in sediments. Thermophilic methanogens are found to grow in Hydrothermal vent plumes at temperatures between 55 ¬∞C to 80 ¬∞C. However, autotropic methanogenesis performed by many thermophilic species require H2 as an electron donor so microbial growth is limited by H2 availability. Genera of thermophilic methanogens found at hydrothermal vents include Methanocaldococcus, Methanothermococcus, and Methanococcus. The sulfur cycle processes relevant to hydrothermal vent microbial communities with examples of phyla/genera.  Sulfur Cycle  Microbial communities at hydrothermal vent convert sulfur such as H2S produced by geological activity into other forms such as sulfite, sulfate, and elemental sulfur for energy or assimilation into organic molecules. Sulfide is plentiful at Hydrothermal Vents, with concentrations from one to tens of mM, whereas the surrounding ocean water usually only contains a few nano molars.  Sulfur Oxidation  Reduced sulfur compounds such as H2S produced by the hydrothermal vents are a major source of energy for sulfur metabolism in microbes. Oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds into forms such as sulfite, thiosulfate, and elemental sulfur is used to produce energy for microbe metabolism such as synthesis of organic compounds from inorganic carbon. The major metabolic pathways used for sulfur oxidation includes the SOX pathway and dissimilatory oxidation. The Sox pathway is a multi enzyme pathway capable of oxidizing sulfide, sulfite, elemental sulfur, and thiosulfate to sulfate. Dissimilatory oxidation converts sulfite to elemental sulfur. Sulfur oxidizing species include and the genera of Thiomicrospira, Halothiobacillus, Beggiatoa, Persephonella, and Sulfurimonas. Symbiotic species of the class Gammaproteobacteria, EpsilonproteobacteriaI can also oxidize sulfur.  Sulfur Reduction  Sulfur reduction uses sulfate as an electron acceptor for the assimilation of sulfur. Microbes that perform sulfate reduction typically use hydrogen, methane or organic matter as an electron donor. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) often use sulfate as electron acceptor. This method is favoured by organisms living in highly anoxic areas of the hydrothermal vent, thus are one of the predominate processes that occur within the sediments. Species that reduce sulfate have been identified in Archaea and members of Deltaproteobacteria such as Desulfovibrio, Desulfobulbus, Desulfobacteria, and Desulfuromonas at hydrothermal vents. Processes of the nitrogen cycle relevant to microbial communities at hydrothermal vents, including names of pyla/genera. Adapted from Gruber et al. (2008)  Nitrogen Cycle  Deep ocean water contains the largest reservoir of nitrogen available to hydrothermal vents with around 0.59 mM of dissolved Nitrogen gas. Ammonium is the dominate species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and can be produced by water mass mixing below hydrothermal vents and discharged in vent fluids. Quantities of available ammonium varies with each vent depending on the geological activity and microbial composition. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations are depleted in hydrothermal vents compared to the surrounding seawater. The study of the Nitrogen Cycle in hydrothermal vent microbial communities still requires more comprehensive research. However, isotope data suggests that microorganism influence dissolved inorganic nitrogen quantities and compositions and all pathways of the nitrogen cycle are likely to be found at hydrothermal vents. Biological nitrogen fixation is important to provide some of the biologically available nitrogen to the nitrogen cycle especially at unsedimented hydrothermal vents. Nitrogen fixation is done by many different microbes including methanogen in the orders Methanomicrobiales, Methanococcales, and Methanobacteriales. Thermophilic microbes have been found to be able to fix nitrogen at higher temperatures such as 92 ¬∞C. Nitrogen fixation may be especially prevalent in microbial mats and particulate material where biologically available levels of nitrogen are low, due to high microbe density and anaerobic environment allows the function of nitrogenase, a nitrogen fixing enzyme. Evidence have also been detected of assimilation, nitrification, denitrification, anamox, mineralization and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. For example, sulfur oxidizing bacteria like Begiatoa species, perform denitrification and reduces nitrate to oxidize H2S. Nitrate assimilation is done by symbiotic species of Riftia pachyptila tubeworm  Bacterial Diversity  The most abundant bacteria in hydrothermal vents are chemolithotrophs. These bacteria use reduced chemical species, most often sulfur, as sources of energy to reduce carbon dioxide to organic carbon. The chemolithotrophic abundance in a hydrothermal vent environment is determined by the available energy sources; different temperature vents have different concentrations of nutrients, suggesting large variation between vents. In general, large microbial populations are found in warm vent water plumes (25 ¬∞C), the surfaces exposed to warm vent plumes and in symbiotic tissues within certain vent invertebrates in the vicinity of the vent.  Sulfur-oxidizing  These bacteria use various forms of available sulfur (S‚àí2, S0, S2O3‚àí2) in the presence of oxygen. They are the predominant population in the majority of hydrothermal vents because their source of energy is widely available, and chemosynthesis rates increase in aerobic conditions. The bacteria at hydrothermal vents are similar to the types of sulfur bacteria found in other H2S-rich environments - except Thiomicrospira has replaced Thiobacillus. Other common species are Thiothrix and Beggiatoa, which is of particular importance because of its ability to fix nitrogen.  Methane-oxidizing  Methane is a substantial source of energy in certain hydrothermal vents, but not others: methane is more abundant in warm vents (25 ¬∞C) than hydrogen. Many types of methanotrophic bacteria exist, which require oxygen and fix CH4, CH3NH2, and other C1 compounds, including CO2 and CO, if present in vent water. These type of bacteria are also found in Riftia trophosome, indicating a symbiotic relationship. Here, methane-oxidizing bacteria refers to methanotrophs, which are not the same as methanogens: Methanococcus and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii are examples methanogens, which are found in hydrothermal vents; whereas Methylocystaceae are methanotrophs, which have been discovered in hydrothermal vent communities as well.  Hydrogen-oxidizing  Little is known about microbes that use hydrogen as a source of energy, however, studies have shown that they are aerobic, and also symbiotic with Riftia (see below). These bacteria are important in the primary production of organic carbon because the geothermally-produced H2 is taken up for this process. Hydrogen-oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria may be abundant in vents where NO3‚àí-containing bottom seawater mixes with hydrothermal fluid. Desulfonauticus submarinus is a hydrogenotroph that reduces sulfur-compounds in warm vents and has been found in tube worms R. pachyptila and Alvinella pompejana.  Iron- and manganese- oxidizing  These bacteria are commonly found in iron and manganese deposits on surfaces exposed intermittently to plumes of hydrothermal and bottom seawater. However, due to the rapid oxidation of Fe2+ in neutral and alkaline waters (i.e. freshwater and seawater), bacteria responsible for the oxidative deposition of iron would be more commonly found in acidic waters. Manganese- oxidizing bacteria would be more abundant in freshwater and seawater compared to iron-oxidizing bacteria due to the higher concentration of available metal.  Ecology   Symbiotic Relationships  Symbiotic chemosynthesis is an important process for hydrothermal vent communities. At warm vents, common symbionts for bacteria are deep-sea clams, Calpytogena magnifica, mussels such as Bathyomodiolus thermophilus and pogonophoran tube worms, Riftia pachyptila, and Alvinella pompejana. The trophosome of these animals are specified organs for symbionts that contains valuable molecules for chemosynthesis. These organisms have become so reliant on their symbionts that they have lost all morphological features relating to ingestion and digestion, though the bacteria are provided with H2S and free O2. Additionally, methane-oxidizing bacteria have been isolated from C. magnifica and R. pachyptila, which indicate that methane assimilation may take place within the trophosome of these organisms.  Phyla and Genera  To illustrate the incredible diversity of hydrothermal vents, the list below is a cumulative representation of bacterial phyla and genera, in alphabetical order. As shown, proteobacteria appears to be the most dominant phyla present in deep-sea vents. * Actinobacteria * Aquificae ** Hydrogenobacter and Aquifex * Chloroflexi * Chlorobi - Chlorobium * Deferribacteres * Gemmatimonadetes * Nitrospirae ** Nitrospinae ** Leptospirillum ferriphilum * Firmicutes ** Acetogen: Clostridium * Proteobacteria ** Acidithiobacillia ** Alphaproteobacteria *** Paracoccus ** Betaproteobacteria *** Thiobacillus *** Sideroxydans lithotrophicus ** Gammaproteobacteria - major symbionts *** Allochromatium *** Thiomicrospira *** Thioalkalivibrio *** Methylococcaceae *** Beggiatoa *** Thioploca ** Deltaproteobacteria - sulfate-reducing, make up more than 25% of the bacterial community *** Desulfovibrio *** Desulfobulbus *** Desulfuromonas ** Epsilonproteobacteria *** Sulfurovum lithotrophicum *** Sulfurimonas paralvinellae *** Nitratifactor salsuginis *** Hydrogenimonas thermophila *** Thiovulum * Thermodesulfobacteria * Zetaproteobacteria ** Mariprofundus ferrooxydans  Viruses and deep-sea hydrothermal vents  Black smoker in the High Rise portion of the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents. Viruses are the most abundant life in the ocean, harboring the greatest reservoir of genetic diversity. As their infections are often fatal, they constitute a significant source of mortality and thus have widespread influence on biological oceanographic processes, evolution and biogeochemical cycling within the ocean. Evidence has been found however to indicate that viruses found in vent habitats have adopted a more mutualistic than parasitic evolutionary strategy in order to survive the extreme and volatile environment they exist in. Deep- sea hydrothermal vents were found to have high numbers of viruses indicating high viral production. Samples from the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents off the coast southwest British Columbia showed that active venting black smokers had viral abundances from 1.45x105 to 9.90x107 per mL with a drop-off in abundance found in the hydrothermal-vent plume (3.5x106 per mL) and outside the venting system (2.94x106 per mL). The high number-density of viruses and therefore viral production (in comparison to surrounding deep-sea waters) implies that viruses are a significant source of microbial mortality at the vents. Like in other marine environments, deep-sea hydrothermal viruses affect abundance and diversity of prokaryotes and therefore impact microbial biogeochemical cycling by lysing their hosts to replicate. However, in contrast to their role as a source of mortality and population control, viruses have also been postulated to enhance survival of prokaryotes in extreme environments, acting as reservoirs of genetic information. The interactions of the virosphere with microorganisms under environmental stresses is therefore thought to aide microorganism survival through dispersal of host genes through Horizontal Gene Transfer. > Each second, ‚Äúthere's roughly Avogadro‚Äôs number of infections going on in > the ocean, and every one of those interactions can result in the transfer of > genetic information between virus and host‚Äù ‚Äî Curtis Suttle Temperate phages (those not causing immediate lysis) can sometimes confer phenotypes that improve fitness in prokaryotes [7] The lysogenic life-cycle can persist stably for thousands of generations of infected bacteria and the viruses can alter the host's phenotype by enabling genes (a process known as lysogenic conversion) which can therefore allow hosts to cope with different environments. Benefits to the host population can also be conferred by expression of phage-encoded fitness-enhancing phenotypes. Lysogenic Cycle: 1. The prokaryotic cell is shown with its DNA, in green. 2. The bacteriophage attaches and releases its DNA, shown in red, into the prokaryotic cell. 3. The phage DNA then moves through the cell to the host's DNA. 4. The phage DNA integrates itself into the host cell's DNA, creating prophage. 5. The prophage then remains dormant until the host cell divides. 6. After the host cell has duplicated, the phage DNA in the daughter cells activate, and the phage DNA begins to express itself. Some of the cells containing the prophage go on to create new phages which will move on to infect other cells. A review of viral work at hydrothermal vents published in 2015 stated that vents harbour a significant proportion of lysogenic hosts and that a large proportion of viruses are temperate indicating that the vent environments may provide an advantage to the prophage. One study of virus-host interactions in diffuse- flow hydrothermal vent environments found that the high-incidence of lysogenic hosts and large populations of temperate viruses was unique in its magnitude and that these viruses are likely critical to the systems ecology of prokaryotes. The same study's genetic analysis found that 51% of the viral metagenome sequences were unknown (lacking homology to sequenced data), with high diversity across vent environments but lower diversity for specific vent sites which indicates high specificity for viral targets. A metagenomic analysis of deep-sea hydrothermal vent viromes showed that viral genes manipulated bacterial metabolism, participating in metabolic pathways as well as forming branched pathways in microbial metabolism which facilitated adaptation to the extreme environment. An example of this was associated with the sulfur-consuming bacterium SUP05. A study found that 15 of 18 viral genomes sequenced from samples of vent plumes contained genes closely related to an enzyme that the SUP05 chemolithoautotrophs use to extract energy from sulfur compounds. The authors concluded that such phage genes (auxiliary metabolic genes) that are able to enhance the sulfur oxidation metabolism in their hosts could provide selective advantages to viruses (continued infection and replication). The similarity in viral and SUP05 genes for the sulfur metabolism implies an exchange of genes in the past and could implicate the viruses as agents of evolution. Another metagenomic study found that viral genes had relatively high proportion of metabolism, vitamins and cofactor genes, indicating that viral genomes encode auxiliary metabolic genes. Coupled with the observations of a high proportion of lysogenic viruses, this indicates that viruses are selected to be integrated pro-viruses rather than free floating viruses and that the auxiliary genes can be expressed to benefit both the host and the integrated virus. The viruses enhance fitness by boosting metabolism or offering greater metabolic flexibility to the hosts they‚Äôre within. The evidence suggests that deep-sea hydrothermal vent viral evolutionary strategies promote prolonged host integration, favoring a form of mutualism to classic parasitism. As hydrothermal vents outlets for sub- seafloor material, there is also likely a connection between vent viruses and those in the crust.

It is caused by pathogenic variants in ACOX1, which codes for the production of an enzyme called peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX1). This specific enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Defective function of the ACOX1 enzyme prevents proper breakdown of these VLCFAs, leading to accumulation and interference with the nervous system. Acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency affects a person from birth, and most newborns affected with this condition will not survive past early childhood. Affected individuals can be born with hypotonia, seizures, and dysmorphic features, such as widely spaced eyes, a low nasal bridge and low set ears. Polydactyly and hepatomegaly have also been described. Most babies will learn to walk and begin speaking, before experiencing a rapid decline in motor function between the ages of 1 and 3. As the person ages, and the conditions worsens, they begin to experience exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), more severe and frequent seizures, and gradual loss of vision and hearing. There is no cure for this condition, however there are a range of symptom-based treatments, used to provide supportive care. Signs and symptoms Children are born with this condition and their symptoms can be seen immediately. In the early stages these can appear quite mild; weak muscle tone (often extreme hypotonia), lack of neonatal reflexes, seizures and abnormal (dysmorphic) facial features such as widely spaced eyes, a low nasal bridge, low set ears and an abnormally large forehead. Due to the nature of the disease, in the build-up of VLCFAs, symptoms worsen progressively over time. Children can often reach the stage at which they begin to walk and talk, before experiencing a rapid decline in motor skills due to demyelination and subsequent nerve damage. A hearing deficit may develop, eyesight and response to visual and physical stimuli begins to diminish and eventually becomes non- existent. The life expectancy of an individual with ACOX1 deficiency is 5 years. Genetics Acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in ACOX1. This is the gene that codes for the production of an enzyme called peroxisomal straight- chain acyl-CoA oxidase which is responsible for the breakdown of VLCFAs. It is not completely clear how the build-up of these VLCFAs causes the symptoms seen with this condition, however research suggests that this abnormal accumulation triggers an inflammation in the nervous system which leads to demyelination. Demyelination leads to the loss of white matter, leukodystrophy, in the brain and spinal cord. It is this leukodystrophy that is related to the development of neurological abnormalities in people with Acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. Acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency is an extremely rare condition. Diagnosis Diagnosis can be done both prenatally based on family history and after birth based on clinical suspicion. The primary prenatal diagnosis techniques involve the assessment of amniotic fluid for an abnormal elevation in VLCFAs, and a reduced presence (or in some cases complete absence) of acyl-CoA oxidase in fibroblasts. If the causative variants in a family are known, prenatal diagnosis can be performed by molecular testing. After birth, there are a number of diagnostic techniques available for use. A blood sample can be taken, from which the serum levels of VLCFAs and acyl-CoA oxidase activity can be assessed. Analysis of VLCFAs is important for the identification of ACOX1 deficiency, if a leukodystrophy has been identified Since the condition is genetic, and is caused by pathogenic variants in ACOX1, it can be confirmed by sequence or copy number analysis. Due to the rarity of this condition, people who have it may not be diagnosed early in their disease progression. As a result, acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency may be misdiagnosed as similar conditions such as Usher syndrome and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy. Treatment There are no cures for ACOX1 deficiency, supportive care is used to manage specific clinical symptoms for affected individuals. Treatment is based upon symptoms, with the aim the provide some relief. Pharmacologic agents are used to help improve muscle tone (management of dystonia) and to block neurological signalling to the muscle. Physical therapy is used to improve movement and function. For the specific treatment of recurrent seizures, there are both pharmaceutical and surgical options.

As part of wider Russification efforts, the Tsarist government decided to close the women's Benedictine monastery in Kra≈æiai. The locals petitioned keep the monastery Church of the Immaculate Conception open and transform it into a parish church. The Tsar ordered the monastery closed and demolished in June 1893. The locals started a constant vigil inside the church protecting it from members of the clergy who tried to comply with the orders. On 21 November, Governor of Kaunas personally arrived to the town to supervise the closure. Lithuanians resisted and overpowered 70 policemen that Klingenberg brought with him. The next morning, about 300 Don Cossacks arrived from Varniai and were given a free rein to loot and brutalize. According to official data, nine people died and 54 were injured. At least 24 women were raped and 16 men flogged with nagaikas. 71 persons were put on trial for rioting and disobeying police orders, but the cruelty of the Cossacks caused a public outcry and the people received a pardon from the Tsar. The event became a rallying cry of the Lithuanian National Revival. Background Governor of Kaunas who personally supervised the closure of the monastery church in Kra≈æiai After the Third Partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Lithuania became part of the Russian Empire. In response to the failed uprisings in 1831 and 1863‚Äì1864, Tsarist authorities enacted various Russification policies, including the Lithuanian press ban and various restrictions on the Roman Catholic Church. The government often closed churches and chapels attached to manors or cemeteries as well as monasteries and their churches. In Samogitia, authorities closed some 50 Catholic monasteries and in five towns (D≈´k≈°tas, ≈†e≈°uoliai, Tytuvƒónai, Kƒôstaiƒçiai, and Kra≈æiai) local residents attempted to protest and resist the closures. The monastery and church in Kƒôstaiƒçiai were guarded by locals, but closed using a Cossakc force and demolished in 1887. According to the memoirs of Kra≈æiai survivors, they had received tips from people involved in defending the Kƒôstaiƒçiai monastery. Kra≈æiai was a small town with 1,761 residents according to the Russian Empire Census in 1897. The Benedictine women's monastery in Kra≈æiai dated since 1639. In 1757‚Äì1763, the monastery constructed the brick Church of the Immaculate Conception (architect Thomas Zebrowski). On 12 December 1891, Tsar Alexander III of Russia ordered the monastery closed and nine remaining nuns transferred to a Benedictine monastery in Kaunas. Town residents sent the first petitions to the Tsar, Governor-General of Vilna, and Bishop of Samogitia on 7 February 1892. They sent many other petitions, including a total of eight petitions to the Tsar himself, asking to convert the monastery church into a parish church and transform the crumbling wooden parish Church of the Archangel Michael into a cemetery chapel. Governor-General investigated the issue and recommended to the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Empire to transfer the churches. However, on 1 January 1893, Kakhanov who was implicated in a corruption scandal (accused of misappropriating funds collected for a monument to Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky) was replaced by , former commander of the Special Corps of Gendarmes. Orzhevsky was a strong supporter of the various Russification policies and perhaps hoped that his strict stance would gain him favor in Saint Petersburg and restart his political career. The Tsar ordered the monastery and church closed and demolished on 22 June 1893; the stones and bricks were to be used to construct an agricultural school. The Benedictine nuns attempted to delay their move to Kaunas using various excuses, including lack of warm clothing and ill health. They were visited by Russian policemen from Raseiniai and two doctors to inspect their health. When the nuns would not allow the men into their monastery, they broke down the doors and forcibly removed the nuns escorting them to Kaunas. The nuns were forcibly removed on 25 October 1892 and 4 May 1893. This galvanized town residents who started a constant vigil inside the church to protect it and its valuables on 13 September 1893. Several times, local priests attempted to remove the Eucharist, but were stopped by the locals. Massacre Governor of Kaunas personally arrived to the town in the late evening of 21 November. He was met by Lithuanians holding up two large portraits of Tsar Alexander III of Russia and his wife Maria Feodorovna to showcase their loyalty to the Tsar and pleading him to wait for the Tsar to respond to their latest petition. Klingenberg brought about 70 policemen and ordered them to remove the residents (about 300‚Äì400 people) from the church. Lithuanians resisted and overpowered the police. Chief of the Raseiniai Uyezd was beaten and almost hanged, but freed by Russian policemen, while Klingenberg barricaded himself in a church balcony. The scuffle continued through the night. Lithuanians attempted to negotiate with Klingenberg and force him to write a protocol admitting his wrongdoings. As prearranged, about 300 soldiers from the 3rd Regiment of Don Cossacks arrived to the town early next morning. They easily overpowered Lithuanians armed with sticks, flails, and stones. The Cossacks aimed their blows to the head and face as those wounds would be easily spotted later and would help searching for those who managed to escape. The Cossacks freed Klingenberg who ordered the town surrounded and every Catholic, regardless of age or sex, arrested. The arrested men were flogged with nagaikas. Lithuanian sources published 16 names of flogged men, but claimed that they numbered 69. Using the excuse of searching for escaped church defenders, the Cossacks were allowed to plunder the town and surrounding villages for two weeks. They raped women ‚Äì a source from 1933 counted 24 women, including two pregnant women and a 12-year old gang raped by eight Cossacks. Dozens were injured. Nine people died due to beatings and other injuries. There were rumors of people drowning in the nearby river. The Cossacks confiscated 225 sticks and flails. Aftermath Collage of portraits of Kra≈æiai defenders. Top center: four men who received 10-year sentences in katorga. In total, 330 people were interrogated and 71 (34 peasants, 27 nobles, and 10 city residents; 55 men and 16 women) were arrested and put on trial in Vilnius. They were defended pro bono by famous Russian attorneys, including Alexander Ivanovich Urusov and Sergey Andreyevsky. The trial was held on 20‚Äì29 September 1894 in Vilnius. Following the letter of the law, 36 people were acquitted while 35 people were found guilty and received various sentences, including four men who received 10 years of katorga. However, the judges themselves petitioned the new Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to pardon the people and commute the 10-year katorga to one year in prison. A collection of court documents was published in Polish in 1896. The church interior was almost fully demolished. Sculptures were smashed, paintings had bullet holes. Priests moved two side altars to the church in and some other items to the parish church in Kra≈æiai, but many other items were looted. The church was left essentially empty and was closed, but not demolished. It was returned to the parish in 1908 and, after extensive repairs, reopened on 4 September 1910. Other monastery buildings, except for the chapel of St. Roch, did not survive. The wooden Church of the Archangel Michael burned down in June 1941. News of the event quickly spread across Lithuania and reached international press, including New York World News and K√∂lnische Volkszeitung. Lithuanian press, including Varpas, ≈™kininkas, and Vienybƒó lietuvnink≈≥, devoted significant attention to the events. They exaggerated casualties and claimed, for example, that 300 Lithuanians were killed or that 600 women were raped. The press attacked the popular notion of \\"good Tsar, bad bureaucrats\\" and praised Kra≈æiai defenders as martyrs and an inspirational example for others to follow. The Lithuanian press also covered the trial, publishing defense attorney speeches and special prayers for the defendants. Soon separate booklets were published in East Prussia (where Lithuanian publishing concentrated) and United States, including a play by Juozapas ≈Ωebrys. The events caused a stir among Lithuanian Americans who collected donations, held lectures, and organized protest rallies. The largest rallies were held on 28 January 1894 in Chicago (estimated 6,000 people) and on 4 March 1894 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania (estimated 7,000 Lithuanians and 3,000 of other nationalities). Cultural impact Historian Nerijus Udrƒónas summarized that the events in Kra≈æiai accelerated two major trends of the Lithuanian National Revival ‚Äì separation of the dual Polish-Lithuanian identity into just Polish or Lithuanian national identities and separation of the Lithuanian National Revival into two main branches (conservative Catholic and liberal secular). Polish press also covered the events, often claiming that the defenders were Poles organized and led by Polish szlachta. Polish journalist wrote a play about the events. Lithuanians protested such attempts to usurp and appropriate the events in the spirit of the old Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and in support of the dual Polish-Lithuanian identity. Lithuanian press denied any involvement of Poles while Polish press blamed Lithuanians for fracturing the united front against the Tsarist regime. In March 1894, Pope Leo XIII issued encyclical Caritatis on the church in Poland sparking a fierce debate between Catholic and secular Lithuanian activists. Vincas Kudirka in Varpas attacked the encyclical because the pope urged compliance and obedience to the Tsarist regime and thus \\"betrayed the blood spilled in Kra≈æiai\\". Defenders of the encyclical, including Pranci≈°kus Buƒçys, pointed out that it forced Tsarist authorities to make concessions and relax restrictions on the Catholic Church and that the pope urged obedience only as much as it did not go against religious beliefs and freedom. After the debate, most of the clergy withdrew their support to Varpas and instead focused on Catholic ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ ir Lietuvos ap≈ævalga and Tƒóvynƒós sargas. People in Kra≈æiai on the 40th anniversary in 1933 The official Catholic hierarchy did not promote the memory of the event because the clergy was very passive if not supportive of the Tsarist authorities. The event was remembered in 1933, the 40th anniversary of the massacre. At the time, the authoritarian regime of Antanas Smetona attempted to lessen the influence of the Roman Catholic Church and thus weaken its main opponent, the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party. Therefore, the struggle against government oppression for religious freedom was once again relevant. According to contemporary press reports, some 10,000 people attended the anniversary events in Kra≈æiai, organized by the Union for the Liberation of Vilnius. The union encouraged people to follow the example of Kra≈æiai defenders and continue to fight for the Vilnius Region disputed with the Second Polish Republic. 38 of the surviving defenders were awarded the Order of Vytautas the Great. Other events were held in other cities and towns, organized by other Lithuanian organizations. Schools were ordered to devote one lesson on 22 November to discussing the massacre. Film director wanted to produce an epic film on the massacre, one of the first films in Lithuanian, and visited 136 cities and towns raising money. The film was not produced due to financial difficulties (it received no support from the government) and Vaiƒçkus' death in 1935. In 1934, exhibition about Kra≈æiai and religious repressions in Russian Empire in general was shown in Kaunas, ≈†iauliai, Klaipƒóda, and Panevƒó≈æys. A small memorial museum in Kra≈æiai was opened in summer 1938. The same year, writer published a two-volume historical novel about the events. There were other plans for commemorating the events with special medals, monument, or enlarged museum all aimed at the anticipated grand ceremony in 1943, the 50th anniversary. However, any such plans were interrupted by World War II and the Soviet occupation in June 1940.

Every year 300 cherry blossom trees spring into full bloom there.  History  This castle is thought to have been built by Takatoki Naganuma in 1260 (Bun'≈ç gannen). The castle is possibly the main base for the Naganuma clan, a branch of the Oyama clan, which is a traditional samurai clan of the Nasu area of the Tochigi prefecture. In the mid-15th century, the Naganuma clan moved their main base to the Shigiyama castle in the captured Aizu Tajima area, but kept the Naganuma castle. Following an ill- fated alliance in approximately 1560 with the Ashina clan (Japan), which soon declined due to military overextension and the death of an heir, the Naganuma clan had a brief alliance with the Date clan. After the Date clan fell out of favor with central ruler Toyotomi Hideyoshi, control of the castle transferred to the warlord Gam≈ç Ujisato, who rebuilt a number of hill castles, including Naganuma Castle, on the model of his own Matsusaka Castle. Upon his death, his territory was transferred to Uesugi Kagekatsu (1556-1623), who posted Tadanao Shimazu, an important retainer, in the Naganuma Castle. The castle was probably destroyed after a 1615 (Genna gannen) decree mandating only one castle per province (‰∏ÄÂõΩ‰∏ÄÂüé‰ª§).  Structure  The castle is located on Hidakami-Yama mountain, a peninsula-like hill of 40 meters in height spreading from the Taishaku mountains toward Koriyama basin, at the center of the former Naganuma Town. Naganuma town is located in a valley formed by the Ebana-Gawa river and Sunoko-Gawa river at the western edge of the Koriyama basin, in the western part of current Sukagawa. The central area of Naganuma castle is a pentagonal, about 70 x 50 meters. At the west side of the central area sits an oblong area about 50 meters long with a stone wall on its south side. Another long and narrow area is at the east side. These three areas at the top of the hill likely were constructed by the Naganuma or Ashina clans. Surrounding these core areas, several terraces of about 40 meters long were built halfway down the hill. These areas are connected by a small buffer area formed by clay walls. While the western part of the castle is connected to the mountains behind it, this side is protected by a deep dry moat about 20 meters wide. The total size of the upper hill area is about 250 x 100 meters, making it a moderately-sized branch castle. The east side of the hill is not protected by marsh. A line of outer barriers separated two rivers. Though most of this part of the castle is lost, a line of clay wall and a dry moat with the shape of a gate remains on private property. The size of the outer barrier is extremely large for a branch castle, and this shows the importance of Naganuma castle for the Gamo clan. Every spring the castle site, now a park, becomes fully covered by cherry blossoms.

They are small reef-associated marine fish which have an Indo-Pacific distribution. Characteristics In the Pseudochrominae the pelvic fin has a single spine and five rays which are branched, the head is covered in scales, there are teeth on the palatine bone and there are 16-20 rays in the pectoral fin. The lateral line is divided into two, with a longer part running from the head to the posterior part of the dorsal fin and located just below the dorsal fin and the other, shorer part on the rear of the flanks. They grow to a maximum length of . Distribution The subfamily Pseudochrominae has a widespread distribution in the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean, mainly in tropical areas. Their distribution extends from the eastern coast of Africa, east across the Indo-Pacific region to American Samoa. The southern limits of the distribution is Durban in South Africa and the Elizabeth Reef in the northern Tasman Sea off Australia and north as far as southern Japan. Biology The species in the Pseudochrominae are mainly associated with reefs, with several species which are found among branching corals and some other species live within large sponges, dottybacks are found from the intertidal shallows down to depths of . A few pseudochromines are social but most are fiercely territorial, defending small areas as home ranges and usually live solitarily, as pairs or very small groups of a male and a few females. They are normally predators of small invertebrates such as crustaceans, small bivalves and gastropods, polychaetes and some small fish. There appear to be little variety in the types of prey taken by different species other than larger species prey on larger prey items. Many species are hermaphroditic, some may be simultaneously hermarphroditic while other species are protogynous hermaphrodites or protandrous hermaphrodites and they adopt the colouring and pattern of the different sex as they transform. Many species produce a \\"fluffy\\", round egg mass which the male often guards in a small cave or burrow, the mass is formed by the interlinking of the filaments which cover the half of the surface of each egg which is opposite the micropyle, these filaments are attached to the surface of the egg by a small loaf-like structure. These loaf strauctures are diagnostic of the pseudochromines. The males guard the eggs until they hatch, which varies from 3‚Äì7 days after hatching the pelagic larvae disperse.

Shiva is worshipped as Arasaleeswarar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Periyanaayagi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple complex covers around one acre and entered through a three tiered gopuram, the main gateway. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Arasaleeswarar and his consort Periyanayagi, being the most prominent. All the shrines of the temple are enclosed in large concentric rectangular granite walls. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Brahmotsavam festival is celebrated during the month of the Vaikasi (May - June) is the most prominent festival. The original complex is believed to have been built by Cholas, while the present masonry structure was built by chieftains during the 16th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Legend of the temple As per Hindu legend, sage Vamadeva visited many temples to worship Shiva. He came to the place and was standing under an Arasu tree (peepli tree) and felt that it would be nice if Shiva appeared in the place. Pleased by the devotion of the sage, Shiva appeared in the place of the Arasu tree and came to be known as Arasaleeswarar and the place came to be known as Arasili. As per another legend, a king named Sathyavardhan who ruled the place was a staunch devotee of Shiva. He installed a garden to garner flowers for his worship. Each day the gardener complained that someone stole the flowers of the garden. The king found that a deer was eating the flowers of the garden. Angered at the deer, the king shot an arrow at it which missed its mark but hit the Arasu tree behind. The king found that blood was oozing out from the Arasu tree, which the king found out to be the incarnation of Shiva. The scar mark in the Lingam of the temple is believed to be the arrow hit by the king. History A shrine in the temple Most of the Chola temples built during the period of 866 and 1004 CE is associated with certain military events or political campaign. During 940 Parantaka I had frequent trouble from invading Rashtrakutas. Takkolam War, dubbed as the greatest war held in the Tamil region, was fought between Cholas and Rashtrakutas. Parantaka's son Rajaditya was killed in the campaign and Krishna III assumed the name \\"conqueror of Tanjai and Kanchi\\". The temple has five inscriptions from the period of the Medieval Cholas like Vikrama Chola and Kulothunga Chola. In modern times, the temple is administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The bronze idols of the temple were stolen and were later restored by idol wing of Tamil Nadu Police during 2009. Architecture The temple has a three-tiered gateway tower and all the shrines of the temple are enclosed in concentric rectangular granite walls. The temple occupies an area of around . The central shrine houses the image of Arasaleeswarar in the form of Lingam. The image of Lingam is made of sand and sacred ablution is performed only on the Aavudayar.

There is also a residential and tourism development called Mackay Marina with 479 marina berths.  History  Sketch map of Mackay Harbour, 1939 When Mackay was first settled, ships came into port in the Pioneer River. However, by 1884, there were problems accommodating larger ships in the river. Although a new port had been desired since 1887, there was no progress in building one until l the Australian Government provided a grant of ¬£250,000 and a loan of ¬£1,000,000 in 1933. Work started on the port with the laying of a foundation stone on 14 September 1935. On 27 August 1939, the new deep water port was officially opened by Queensland Premier William Forgan Smith. It was an occasion for extensive celebrations in Mackay.Aerial view of Mackay Harbour, circa 1939In 1989 a bulk sugar terminal was opened and became the largest storage facility for sugar in the world.

It spread to other international imageboards, including 4chan, where by 2011 an image of two Wojaks hugging each other under the caption \\"I know that feel bro\\" gained popularity. Wojak's face was also paired with the phrase \\"that feel\\" or \\"that feel when\\", often shortened to \\"tfw\\". Later variants often paired Wojak with the originally unrelated character of Pepe the Frog. The relationship between these characters varied significantly depending on the artist, with Pepe sometimes providing Wojak with companionship and other times subjecting him to violent and scatological abuse.  Notable variants  Brainlet In 2016, the act of posting modified Wojak faces of ridiculed or deformed nature (referred to as \\"brainlet\\" Wojaks or Slowjaks) emerged as a way to criticize the intelligence of a poster as a form of ad hominem argument. A common variation of Wojak-derived images posted in this trend are heads with disproportionately large, wrinkled brains, meant to depict high intelligence. NPC In October 2018, a Wojak with a gray face, pointy nose and blank, emotionless facial expression, dubbed \\"NPC Wojak\\", became a popular visual representation for people who supposedly cannot think for themselves or make their own decisions, comparing them to Non-Player Characters - computer- automated characters within a video game. NPC Wojak has gained online notoriety. The meme gained media attention, initially in Kotaku and The New York Times, due to its usage in parodying the perceived herd mentality of American leftists. This usage of the meme has been attributed to Donald Trump supporters. About 1,500 Twitter accounts falsely posing as liberal activists with the NPC meme as a profile picture were suspended for allegedly spreading misinformation about the 2018 United States elections. On January 13, 2019, a conservative art collective known as \\"The Faction\\" hijacked a billboard for Real Time with Bill Maher, replacing Maher's image with that of the NPC Wojak.  Coomer  In November 2019, the \\"Coomer\\" Wojak picked up in popularity with the \\"No Nut November\\" trend. The Coomer depicts a Wojak edit with unkempt hair and an untidy beard, to raise awareness about porn addiction. A lot of the popularity of this meme can be attributed to the \\"Coomer Pledge\\", a viral internet trend which dared people to abstain from masturbation for all of November, and change their profile picture to an image of the Coomer if they were to fail.  Doomer  The doomer is an image macro and character archetype that first appeared on 4chan. The image typically depicts wojak in a beanie, smoking a cigarette. The archetype often embodies nihilism and despair, with a belief in the incipient end of the world to causes ranging from climate apocalypse to peak oil to (more locally) opioid addiction. The meme first appeared on 4chan's /r9k/ board in September 2018. A related meme format, \\"doomer girl\\", began appearing on 4chan in January 2020, and it soon moved to other online communities, including Reddit and Tumblr, often by women claiming it from its 4chan origins. This format is described by The Atlantic as \\"a quickly sketched cartoon woman with black hair, black clothes, and sad eyes ringed with red makeup\\". The doomer girl character often appears in image macros interacting with the original doomer character.

Brunner served as head of the Einsatzkommando 4/I during the invasion of Poland and the early stages of the German occupation in 1939, tasked with the killing of Polish civilians. During his time in Northern Italy he was also responsible for the arrest, and ultimately, the deportation of the Jews in his area of jurisdiction, as well as reprisals against Italian civilians. After the war Brunner was held at Island Farm Prisoner of War Camp. He later entered the Bavarian government service and died in 1980 without facing prosecution for his criminal conduct during the war. Biography Brunner was born in Passau on 26 July 1900 in what was then the Kingdom of Bavaria within the German Empire. During World War I, from September 1917 onward, he served in the Bavarian 16th Infantery Regiment \\"Gro√üherzog Ferdinand von Toskana\\", from which he was discharged in 1919. Leaving the Bavarian Army with the rank of lieutenant, Brunner joined the Freikorps, a right-wing paramilitary militia, in 1919 and was part of the Marine-Brigade Ehrhardt in 1922‚Äì23. After studying law at the University of Munich, he worked as a lawyer from 1927 onward. In March 1933, Brunner joined the Sturmabteilung (SA), and the Nazi Party. In June 1934 he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) and, from January to September 1935, worked in the SiPo. From April 1937 to June 1940 was head of the Gestapo in Munich. In this role he was responsible for securing employment in an aircraft factory for Max Troll, a communist-turned-informer who betrayed over 250 resistance members to the Gestapo between 1933 and 1936. With the invasion of Poland, Brunner served as head of the Einsatzkommando 4/I until November 1939, tasked with the killing of Polish civilians as part of Operation Tannenberg. From early 1940 to April 1944 he was Inspector of the Security police in Salzburg. Simultaneously, since March 1941, he headed Amt Ia at the Reich Main Security Office. From 15 September 1943 he was also SS and police leader for the Alpine Foothills, based in Bolzano, a position he held until the end of the war. During his time in Italy, Brunner, a fanatical Nazi, was responsible for the deportation of Italian Jews to extermination camps and reprisals against Italian civilians and partisans. Shortly after his arrival in Northern Italy, on 12 September 1943, he ordered the arrest of all Jews in his jurisdiction. Brunner has also been blamed for some the final atrocities committed by Germany in Italy, after the German surrender. After the surrender, celebrations of the Italian-speaking population broke out that saw 11 people killed in Merano on 30 April and 41 people killed at Bolzano on 3 May 1945, when Wehrmacht and SS units fired on civilians. This and the encounters between German troops and Italian partisans has been referred to as the Battle of Bolzano (). Brunner was arrested in Bolzano on 13 May 1945. He spend the next three years in British Prisoner of War Camps, the final year of it at Island Farm, and was released in May 1948. During his time in the SS he rose to the rank Generalmajor of the police, promoted on 21 October 1942, and SS- Brigadef√ºhrer (brigadier general), promoted on 9 November 1942. He was also awarded the Iron Cross first class in January 1945. His membership number in the SS was 107,161 and in the Nazi Party, 1,903,386. In post-war Germany, Brunner worked for the Gehlen Organization, a predecessor of the Bundesnachrichtendienst, the domestic West German intelligence service. In 1956, he re-entered Bavarian government service, rising to the rank of a Regierungsrat in the district of Pfaffenhofen. Brunner never faced any charges for his criminal conduct in the SS during the war.

The NPC meme, which graphically is based on the Wojak meme, was created in July 2016 by an anonymous author and first published on the imageboard 4chan, where the idea and inspiration behind the meme were introduced. The NPC meme has gained widespread attention and been featured in numerous news outlets, including The New York Times, The Verge, BBC, and Breitbart News Network. History The concept of the NPC first appeared on 4chan on July 7, 2016. The post by an anonymous user who initiated the NPC meme, titled \\"Are you an NPC?\\", detailed the behavior of individuals acting similarly to non-player characters in video games by repeatedly using phrases such as \\"JUST BE YOURSELF\\", and ended the post with the following description of people the NPC meme intends to depict. The design of the NPC meme character is based on Wojak (, ), a meme created in Microsoft Paint in 2010. Unlike the NPC meme, the Wojak meme (also known as Feels Guy) appeared first on the image hosting website vichan and has mainly been used for expression of feelings, most often melancholy or regret. During the weeks leading up to the 2018 midterm elections in the United States, the NPC meme gained remarkable attention, with relatively high media coverage, publication of new NPC memes online, and several noticeable events. A large number of animated videos based on the NPC meme were uploaded to YouTube in the second half of October 2018, and Google searches for the term \\"NPC Wojak\\" peaked around the same time. In October 2018, a large number of Twitter accounts were created which presented themselves as NPCs, and more than 1,500 such accounts were subsequently banned by Twitter. Also during the same month, InfoWars held a competition promoting creation of NPC memes (according to an InfoWars article titled \\"Meme War 3.0: Infowars Launches $10K NPC Meme Contest\\"), which resulted in hundreds of NPC memes submitted (according to an InfoWars article titled \\"Check Out The NPC Meme Finalists - Winner TBA\\"). The number of searches for the search term \\"NPC Wojak\\" remained relatively constant during 2019, though at a level significantly lower than its peak from early October through mid November 2018. Although the NPC meme was created 6 years after the Wojak meme, the NPC meme rapidly gained attention in comparison with the Wojak meme. On the website of the meme community Know Your Meme, the NPC meme has 858,000 page views, 33 videos, 597 images and 749 comments as of December 31, 2019. This can be compared to the Wojak meme on which NPC is based, which has 787,000 page views, 6 videos, 332 images and 47 comments as of December 31, 2019. A Reddit forum or subreddit exclusively for \\"right wing, political\\" NPC memes without \\"extremist content\\" called r/NPCMemes was created on October 10, 2018. Characteristics In appearance, the NPC character is gray in color and simple in its design, with an expressionless face with a triangular nose and a blank stare. The shape of the NPC face resembles that of Wojak, and is drawn crudely. The initialism NPC refers to non-player character, a term used in video-games for characters the player cannot control. As such, a non-player character in a game is controlled by the computer, and typically interacts with the player through simple and repetitive actions, such as communicating the same sentence each time the player approaches the NPC. As such, NPCs have \\"no internality, agency, or capacity for critical thought\\", they rely on scripted lines and do not think by themselves. Following the analogy of non- player characters, the NPC meme is used to mock individuals the maker perceives as lacking those attributes, generally political opponents. The NPC responds using simple dialogue resembling video game NPCs, with no capability for discussion. Due to NPC memes' greater popularity among the political right, the NPC is generally portrayed as parroting left-wing positions. Despite being co-opted by right-wing movements to \\"mock leftists,\\" both left- and right-wing NPC variants exist. ‚Ä¢‚é≥‚Ä¢ is a kaomoji version of the NPC meme. Media coverage The NPC meme has been featured in major and minor news outlets alike, with frequent coverage during the peak of the NPCs popularity in fall 2018. According to The Verge, a few articles (including one by The New York Times published on October 16, 2018) sparked a \\"domino effect\\" and led to increased spread of the meme on Twitter, YouTube and through articles. The NPC meme has been covered by news agencies of varying political stances, including Kotaku (a video games news agency claimed to be \\"far-left\\" by for example Media Research Center) and Breitbart News Network (a news agency claimed to be \\"far-right\\" by for example The Week). Notable events Twitter mass ban In October 2018, users of r/The_Donald, a large subreddit that supported United States President Donald Trump, coordinated in creating accounts presented as NPCs on the American microblogging and social networking service Twitter. According to The Week, the accounts spread \\"bland, politically correct messages intended to mimic and provoke liberal pronouncements\\". Following the mass creation of NPC Twitter accounts, the term \\"NPC\\" was used over 30,000 times on Twitter in a time span of 24 hours. Twitter responded to the event by banning more than 1,500 of its users presenting themselves as NPCs. The created accounts typically used profile pictures of NPC with slight modifications, such as colorful hair or partially covering masks. According to one or more anonymous sources quoted by The Week and The New York Times, the users were banned for violating a term of use by Twitter against \\"intentionally misleading election-related content\\", ahead of the United States 2018 midterm election. The claim that NPC memes were used to spread misinformation about the 2018 United States midterm election is also reported by other news agencies, including The Verge, BBC and The Independent, although no examples are presented. The decision by Twitter to remove NPC accounts has upset many conservatives according to BBC, and following a review of Twitter's banning of accounts, the conservative nonprofit media watchdog Media Research Center raised the concern that Twitter was upholding a double standard favoring the political left. InfoWars competition On October 17, 2018, InfoWars announced a competition in which participants were given a chance to win $10,000 for submitting the \\"best Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson or other Infowars-themed\\" NPC meme (according to an InfoWars article titled \\"Meme War 3.0: Infowars Launches $10K NPC Meme Contest\\"). The competition ended on October 22, 2018 (according to an InfoWars article titled \\"Meme War 3.0: Infowars Launches $10K NPC Meme Contest\\"), and hundreds of submissions were reportedly received (according to an InfoWars article titled \\"Check Out The NPC Meme Finalists - Winner TBA\\"). Information about the competition was also announced on the subreddit r/The_Donald, and on the 4chan forum /pol/, where over 300 replies to the announcement were posted within the first 24 hours following. The winning submission in the competition, which was reported by Alex Jones on the InfoWars broadcast on November 28, 2018, was a video featuring Antifa, CNN, and the Democratic Party of the United States (according to an InfoWars article titled \\"NPC Meme Contest Winner Announced!\\"). The winning video, which is 2 minutes and 20 seconds long, features a man who while walking in a city, sees things around him differently when he is using sunglasses (with the InfoWars logotype on) compared to when the glasses are not used. The video was published on YouTube with the title \\"Another NPC in the Wall\\" on October 21, 2018, and has been viewed more than 60,000 times. Billboard defacing In 2019, the NPC meme was used in the modification of two existing billboards in the United States. On January 13, 2019, the conservative street artist group The Faction modified a billboard featuring American comedian Bill Maher in West Hollywood using the NPC meme. The billboard, advertising an upcoming season of the TV show Real Time with Bill Maher on the television network HBO, had the face of Maher replaced by that of an NPC, the text \\"THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT\\" replaced by \\"THE WHOLE NARRATIVE AND NOTHING BUT\\", and the text \\"HBO\\" replaced by \\"NPC\\" (according to a Breitbart article titled \\"Bill Maher Blasts ‚ÄòIncels‚Äô Who Defaced ‚ÄòReal Time‚Äô Billboard with NPC Meme\\"). On February 19, 2019, a similar modification was performed on a billboard featuring English comedian John Oliver in Los Angeles, in which the face of Oliver was replaced by that of an NPC, and text \\"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\\" was replaced by \\"The Orange Man Bad Show with John Oliver\\". The modified billboard also included the text \\"*MATRIX APPROVED NPC PROGRAMMING\\" and a speech balloon from the NPC containing a slur. According to The Daily Dot, the modification of the billboard featuring Oliver, also credited to The Faction, was an attempt to counteract the media's \\"Trump derangement syndrome\\".

The Duchy of Aquitaine was held in fief by King Edward I of England as a vassal of King Philip IV of France. Starting with a fishing fleet dispute and then naval warfare, the conflict escalated to open warfare between the two countries. In spite of a French military victory on the ground, the war ended when the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1303, which restored the status quo. The war was a premise to future tensions between the two nations culminating in the Hundred Years' War. Background The Duchy of Aquitaine was a personal possession of the King Edward I. Edward I had spent his youth in Gascony and also spent three years in Aquitaine between 1286 and 1289. The King of England held the duchy as a vassal of the King of France, since the Treaty of Paris in 1259. Aquitaine and Gascony represented an important source of income and wine for England. King Philip IV continued to strengthen his suzerainty over the feudal fiefs, regularly taking advantage of ability to allow Gascons to appeal English law at the French court. In 1293, a fight between sailors off the Gascon coast, between Gascon and Norman fishing boats, degenerated into open naval war between the two navies of England and France. An Anglo-Gascon fleet attacked a French fleet off the Pointe Saint-Mathieu on 15 May, and then sacked the French port of La Rochelle. The Normans appealed to the King of France for assistance. Ongoing reprisals taken by French ships against the Gascons and English revenge attacks on French ships, led Philip IV to summon Edward I before his court. Edward I sent his younger brother Edmund of Lancaster and Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, to negotiate a truce with the French King. John St John had been appointed as Edward I's lieutenant in Gascony and upon arrival in Gascony, St John set about strengthening and provisioning the English controlled fortified towns and castles, and providing adequate garrisons for them. A settlement was reached between Edward I and Philip IV, allowing the temporary French occupations of the English controlled fortified towns and castles. On 3 February 1294, orders were given by Edward I to allow the French to temporary take possession of the Gascon strongholds. Upon the French taking processions of the castles, the English sold off the provisions and stores that they had collected. Philip IV, however, then summoned Edward I on 21 April, to appear before the French court. Edward I was forfeited of Aquitaine, Gascony and other French possessions on 19 May, for failure to appear personally before the French court. A French army was then sent to occupy the confiscated territories. Edward I renounced his homage to Philip IV and began preparations for war. English expedition of 1294‚Äì1295 The English were delayed in sending an army to Gascony, due to a revolt in Wales by Madog ap Llywelyn. The expedition was led by Edward's nephew John of Brittany and John St John. The English army was finally able to leave Portsmouth on 9 October 1294, raiding Pointe Saint-Mathieu and √éle de R√©. The English fleet arrived off Aquitaine and went up the Garonne River and seized the town of Castillon on 27 October. Travelling up the Gironde estuary from the 28 October, the English captured the towns of Macau (31 October), Bourg (1 November) and Blaye. The fleet then sailed up the Garonne to Bordeaux, however was unable to capture the town after ten days of siege, before the fleet went up stream to Rions, which was captured, along with Podensac and Villeneuve. St John left John of Brittany at Rions and travelled to Bayonne, and laid siege to the town. On 1 January 1295, the French garrison was driven into the castle by the citizens of Bayonne and the citizens opened the town gates to him. The castle surrendered on 9 January. After the successes of the English army, many Gascons joined the English army. French expedition of 1295 Philip IV sent his brother Charles of Valois, the Marshal of France, Guy I of Clermont and the Constable of France, Raoul II of Clermont into Aquitaine and Gascony at the head of a large army that won back most of the English conquests in the Garonne valley. Both John of Brittany and St John defended Rions, but due to the fall of the neighbouring towns and discontent between the English troops, they abandoned Rions, which the French entered on 8 April. The English offensive was halted and the French army retook Podensac and then Saint-Sever in June 1295 after 13 weeks of siege. Saint-Sever was not long held by the French before being retaken by the English, under Hugh de Vere. Charles de Valois left command of the French army to Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix. Only Bourg and Blaye remained in English hands in the north of the duchy and Bayonne and Saint-Sever in the south. English and French expeditions of 1296‚Äì1297 An English relief force was mustered in England, however was delayed from sailing due to a revolt in Scotland in 1295, finally leaving on 4 January 1296 from Plymouth. The army was commanded by Edward I's brother Edmond of Lancaster and Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln. Messengers were sent to Brittany, requesting passage through Brittany and to gather provisions, however the messengers were hanged by the Bretons, and in revenge Edmund plundered Brittany on his way to Gascony. The English army arrived in Gascony in March 1296. Staying at Bourg and Blaye, the English army was joined by many Gascons, swelling Edmund's forces to more than two thousand men-at-arms. The English army advanced on 28 March to Bordeaux, and laid siege to the town. The towns of Langon and Saint-Macaire surrendered to Edmund's forces. With the news of an approaching French army under Robert of Artois, with difficulties in paying his troops, resulting in parts of the army disbanding, the siege of Bordeaux was ended and the English army retired to Bayonne. Edmund of Lancaster died at Bayonne on 5/6 June. Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln was appointed as the commander of the English army with John St John continuing as Seneschal of Gascony. A siege of the towns of Bordeaux and Dax was undertaken, however after eleven weeks of siege the towns were not captured and the sieges were lifted. The English army, while attempting to resupply the fortress of Bonnegarde, was ambushed by the French army on 2 February 1297. St John, leading a division was outnumbered by the attacking French forces, but Henry de Lacy and the second division retreated from the battlefield. When the Gascon contingent ran away St John was defeated and taken prisoner along with ten other knights. Henry de Lacy retreated to Bayonne, while Robert of Artois was ordered to travel to Flanders to assist with the English expedition to Flanders. Bayonne continued to remain the centre of English power. Henry de Lacy carried out a raid towards Toulouse, which lasted till Michaelmas. De Lacy then went back to Bayonne till after Christmas, and about Easter 1298 returned to England. Negotiations and peace treaty (1297‚Äì1303) Edward I was faced with military failures in Gascony, Scotland and Flanders and together with internal disputes in England about the costly wars and that the English barons had little motivation for a war on the Continent, Edward I and sought a truce with Philip IV, through mediation via Pope Boniface VIII, which was signed on 9 October 1297. The truce is renewed several times during the negotiations until 1303. The truce arranges the marriages of Edward I and Marguerite of France, sister of Philip IV and between Edward I's son the prince Edward and Isabella, daughter of Philip IV. The marriage of Edward I and Marguerite occurred in 1299, while the second occurred in 1308. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1303 which returned Aquitaine to Edward I, in exchange for homage, and ended of the Auld alliance between France and Scotland signed eight years earlier in 1295. Aftermath The recurring problems of the King of England doing homage for lands to the King France, added to issues of the succession to French crown, upon the failure of the Capetian line. King Edward III, the child of King Edward II and Isabella of France, claimed the crown of France of his grandfather Philip IV, as the only male descendant. The outbreak of the Hundred Years' War in 1337 was a result of the tension between the two nations. During this campaign, England was hampered by the problems of supply, financing, and recruitment of armies, which continued to be a problem during the Hundred Years' War.

Starting in Anthony and ending in Las Cruces, NM 478 was once a section of historic US 80, a major transcontinental highway between San Diego, California and Savannah, Georgia. In 1946, it also became part of U.S. Route 85, when the latter highway was extended south to the Mexican border in El Paso, Texas. US 80 and US 85 were rerouted onto a newer alignment to the east in the mid 1950s. This was also around the time the older highway was designated NM 478\\\\. For two years, the southern terminus of NM 478 also served as the national western terminus of US 80 until that highway was removed from New Mexico completely in 1991. Today, NM 478 remains on much the same route it has since it was first designated and serves several old US 80/US 85 communities long since bypassed by I-10 History NM 1 was a predecessor of present day NM 478\\\\. The Kilby Motel on old US 80/US 85 (now NM 478) in Las Cruces. This is currently the oldest motel in Las Cruces still standing. The first designated highway between Anthony at the Texas state line and Las Cruces was New Mexico State Road 1 in 1912. NM 1 continued past Las Cruces through Albuquerque and Santa Fe to the Colorado state line near Raton. The road to Lordsburg was designated NM 4 while the road to Alamogordo was designated NM 3. Between Las Cruces and Anthony, NM 1 passed through Berino and Mesquite. The Dixie Overland Highway auto trail was designated over NM 1 in 1917. The Dixie Overland Highway was the first marked route to run between Savannah, Georgia and southern California. The auto trail entered New Mexico through Anthony from El Paso, Texas, then traveled north to Mesilla Park where it turned west to Deming, Lorsburg and Steins, before heading south into Rodeo and southwest into Arizona towards Douglas. By 1920, the Bankhead Highway was also designated over the southern part of NM 1, further joined by the Old Spanish Trail in 1923. In 1917, Texas State Highway 1 was designated from the south end of NM 1 to El Paso along the Dixie Overland Highway. On November 11, 1926, the United States Department of Agriculture and the American Association of State Highway Officials approved and designated a new numbered transcontinental highway system known as the United States Numbered Highway System. NM 1 was designated as part of U.S. Route 80 between Anthony and Las Cruces, while the section north of Las Cruces became U.S. Route 85. US 80 was also designated over the entirety of NM 4 between Las Cruces and Lordsburg. Much like the Dixie Overland Highway before it, US 80 also ran between San Diego and Savannah. Due to the introduction of the U.S. Highway System into New Mexico, the State Highway Department undertook a massive reorganization of the state highway system in 1927 to better include the new routes. As such, NM 1 was removed in its entirety as was NM 4 in favor of both US 80 and US 85. The only major change to the route for many years was a slight realignment of US 80 through downtown Las Cruces in the 1930s. By 1939, US 70 had replaced NM 3 between Alamogordo and Las Cruces and multiplexed with US 80 from Las Cruces to Lordsburg. To this day, US 70 still travels between Alamogordo and Lordsburg. In 1946, US 85 was extended south to the Mexican border in El Paso, multiplexing with US 80 from Las Cruces into Texas. In 1956, US 80 and US 85 were moved onto a new alignment between Anthony and Las Cruces bypassing the older route through Berino, Vado, Mesquite, Fillmore and Mesilla Park. The old route was re-designated NM 478. The new bypass was later rebuilt to Interstate highway standards and became part of Interstate 10. I-10 replaced all of US 80 through western Texas, New Mexico and part of Arizona. As such, US 80 was truncated to the southern terminus of NM 478 in 1989. In 1991, US 80 was removed from New Mexico completely and the small remaining section became part of NM 460. Much like it did when first designated, NM 478 still ends in the south at NM 460 (former US 80) and US 70 within Las Cruces at the north. Route description Roadside businesses on the side of NM 478, dating back to the US 80/US 85 days. The entire route of NM 478 is long. NM 478 begins at a traffic circle in Anthony with NM 460 and heads due northwest through rural farmland as a two lane highway. In the small community of Berino, NM 478 passes an intersection with Berino Road (NM 226). Further north, the highway passes the western terminus of NM 189 NM 478 reaches Mesquite where it meets NM 192 and NM 228 at a signaled intersection at the center of the small community. A few miles after passing a Y shaped intersection with Show Road, a county maintained highway leading to Mesilla, NM 478 enters the Las Cruces metro area becoming Main Street. After passing Tortugas Drive (NM 138) and Union Avenue (NM 373) NM 478 reaches a pair of freeway ramps at Conway Avenue. There is only an exit ramp and entrance ramp for I-10 east (unsigned US 85 south and US 180 east) here. Drivers can access I-10 west (unsigned US 85 north/US 180 west) via southbound NM 188 (Valley Drive) or eastbound NM 101 a few blocks north. At the intersection and northern terminus of NM 28, NM 478 curves northeast. NM 28 is known as Avenida de Mesilla and is the main road through the old Mexican village. NM 478 meets with NM 342, which uses a pair of one way streets. One block north at Bowman Avenue, NM 478 itself splits into two one way streets, with the northbound lanes using Church Street, while the southbound lanes use Water Street. Until recently, Main Street between the two lanes was a pedestrian street, only just recently rebuilt into a through street for traffic. This area is the heart of downtown Las Cruces. Shortly after Water Street and Church Street converge back into Main Street, NM 478 reaches its northern terminus at a signalized intersection with US 70 at Picacho Street. To the left, westbound US 70 to Deming and Lordsburg is former US 80 west and US 85 north. Along the highway between Anthony and Las Cruces are several old businesses and relics from the era when NM 478 was part of US 80 and US 85\\\\. Many have been closed down and abandoned due to being bypassed by the Interstate. Several old motels and restaurants dot the highway in Las Cruces, including some of the earliest motels built along US 80 in New Mexico.

Shiva is worshiped as Sivalokanathar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Soundaranayagi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple complex covers around one acre and can be entered through a seven-tiered gopuram, the main gateway. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Sivalokanathar and his consort Soundaryanayagi, being the most prominent. All the shrines of the temple are enclosed in large concentric rectangular granite walls. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. Chitra Pournami and Aani Thirumanjanam during the Tamil month of Aaani (June‚ÄìJuly) are the most prominent festivals celebrated in the temple. The original complex is believed to have been built by Cholas, while the present masonry structure was built by Vijayanagar kings during the 16th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Image of the shrines of the temple As per Hindu legend, the Dvarapalas, the gatekeepers named Thindi and Mundi worshipped Shiva at this temple and hence the temple came to be known as Thirumundeeswaram. As per another legend, a king named Chokkalingam came to the place for hunting during Dvapara Yuga. He found a strange lotus flower and wanted to attain it. His men were not able to get it and the king shot an arrow at the flower. The flower started bleeding and the whole tank become red. At the sight of the tank turning red, the king fell unconscious. He found a Lingam on the flower and built a temple around it. Based on the legend, the later kings inscribed the place name as Mouli Gramam, which eventually became Gramam. During the period of Appar during the 7th century, the presiding deity was called Aruttali Mahadevar, but later came to be known as Sivalokanathasvamin. History Most of the Chola temples built during the period of 866 and 1004 CE is associated with certain military events or political campaign. During 940 Parantaka I had frequent trouble from invading Rashtrakutas. Takkolam War, dubbed as the greatest war held in the Tamil region, was fought between Cholas and Rashtrakutas. There was a military station in the region during the time of Parantaka, which was headed by his son Rajaditya Chola. The inscriptions from Kannara-deva (Rashtrakuta Krishna III), mentions the Kannaradeva defeating the Cholas and death of Rajaditya during the Takkolam war. Rajaditya was killed with a spear piercing him while he was seated on the elephant. The event gave him the name Anai-merrunjina- deva. The inscriptions from the period of Parantaka mentions that the temple was converted to a stone temple during the reign and the gift of lamps by Rajaditya (mentioned as Vellan Kumaran). The temple has various inscriptions from the period of the Medieval Cholas like Aditya Chola, Rajendra Chola, and Kulothunga Chola and Pandyan kings like Sundarapandithevan and Veerpandithevan. There are other inscriptions from Rashtrakutas, Vijayanagar kings like Virupanna Udayar. In modern times, the temple is administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture The temple is located on the Villupuram - Thiruvennainallur road. The temple has a seven-tiered gateway tower and all the shrines of the temple are enclosed in concentric rectangular granite walls. The temple occupies an area of around . The central shrine houses the image of Sivalokanathar in the form of Lingam. The central shrine is approached through the flagstaff, Mahamandapam and Ardhamandapam, all of which are located axial to the gateway. The sanctum is square in shape measuring . The Ardhamandapa measures from east to west. The central shrine has entrance towards South and can be approached circumbulating the shrine. The temple tank is located outside the main entrance tower. As in other Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu, the shrines of Vinayaka, Murugan, Navagraha, Chandikesa and Durga are located in niches around the precinct of the main shrine.

The Manchu people is a nation with a long history. The relationship between the ancestors of today's Manchus and the Han people during the period of the ancestors was relatively close, and they traded with each other and married with each other. Background In 1583, the Manchu chieftain Nurhachi began to unite and unified the Jurchen ministries. After the establishment of the Golden State, the Manchu-Chinese relationship was further developed. Later, during the Huang Taiji period, the communication and trade between Manchu and Han became closer. After the Qing army entered the Shanhai Pass, the Manchu and Han nationalities lived together and married with each other. The difference between Manchuria and the Han nationality became progressively smaller over time. In 1644, the regent king Dorgon led the Eight Banners soldiers to enter the Shanhai Pass, destroyed the Southern Ming regime, and established the Qing dynasty of the unified Manchu ruling class. The Manchu-Chinese relationship entered a new stage. The bureaucratic system, land management, military establishment, and culture of the Qing Dynasty were all subject to drastic changes due to the influence of the Central Plains region, which is called the \\"Sinicization of the Manchus\\". The Han Chinese culture and history are deep, and there are many places aspects that other cultures have adopted from it throughout history, having been sinicized or deemed them worth learning. The great feature of Manchu is that they are good at learning. They learn other advanced things for their own use. As long as it is a good culture, it should be studied and developed. During the Qianlong period, the Han culture was revered among Manchus, and the relationship between Manchus and Han people also gained a lot of advantages. Many Han officials also promoted the development of the Qing Dynasty. It can be said that without these Han officials, the demise of the Qing Dynasty would be faster. Although Manchurians were not of Han Chinese origin, especially in the South of China where they were strongly resisted, they absorbed a lot of Chinese culture before conquering Ming Dynasty. Manchu people realized that to dominate the empire, they must act according to Chinese customs, thus retaining many systems of the Ming Dynasty. Central government institutions After the Qing Dynasty entered the customs, the political system was mainly based on the explicit system. Then, according to the actual situation of the society, some adjustments were made to the central government system and local officials. The central government system of the Qing Dynasty mostly followed the Ming Dynasty, but it also had its own new features. The duties of cabinet of the Qing Dynasty were as good as the Ming Dynasty, but the actual rights were much smaller than the previous generation. After a long period of exploration, the Manchu dynasty finally completed the highly centralized political system structure of the imperial power, and developed the centralized political system to the peak. The Qing Dynasty's inheritance of the throne has changed, and at the beginning of the Emperor Yongzheng, he established a secret reserve system. This system is based on the special historical traditions and political culture of the Manchu society. It is a major change to the ancient Chinese tradition of the succession of the throne. It is also a modification of the Manchuria state and development. The Operation of the Flag After the Qing Dynasty entered the customs, because the Manchu people and the Han people lived together and Manchu people learned the Han people's life and production methods, the Manchu people gradually absorbed the advanced Han culture. With the deep communication between the Manchu and Han nationalities, and mutual marriage, the change of Manchu identity became more and more pronounced. The primary manifestation of this change is shown in the way of production, especially in the management of land. Due to the long-term wars between the Ming and Qing Dynasties, large numbers of Han farmers were forced to leave their hometown and move to other places. On the above conditions, the rulers of the Qing Dynasty used their political privileges to plunder huge amounts of land from the hands of the Han people and forcibly redistribute the land. This caused certain damage and blockade of agricultural production in the north. Therefore, the Manchu rulers could not impose their own mode of production which is the serf system on the conquered Han, and only let the Han's original mode of production which is the rent system to continue. Under the strong influence of the feudal tenancy system, the serfdom system gradually declined. In terms of production methods, Manchu and Han are basically the same, and the original differences have gradually disappeared. Expansion of the Eight Banners system Since the ancestors of the Manchus were a hunting nation, they were good at riding and shooting and the soldiers were very strong. After the Qing Dynasty, under the impact of the Han's highly feudal economy, the Manchu people and the Han people lived together and absorbed the advanced system of the Han nationality and Nurhachi created the Eight Banners system. Nurhachi's successor, his eighth son, Hong Taiji (r. 16261642), went further in adopting Han system and using more Han officials. At the same time, the preparation of the Eight Banners has also expanded. The Integration and Development of Culture The evolution of Manchu language is a major event in the Manchu culture. It promoted the progress of the Manchu society and expanded their trade with neighboring peoples. The evolution of the Manchu language helped the Manchus transform from a tribal to a bureaucratic society, helping them to further carry out administrative practice according to the experience of the Han people. In 1644, after the establishment of the Qing Dynasty, the rulers of the Qing Dynasty actively absorbed the Han culture on the one hand, and opposed the complete Hanization of the Manchu on the other hand, and strongly advocated keeping Manchus fundamental custom. However, according to the social environment at that time, the Manchus were sparsely populated, and when they first arrived in the Central Plains, the language was unreasonable and the geography was unfamiliar. If the aristocrats of the Manchu depended only on the strength of their own people, they would rule the vast territory with a minority population of less than one million to control hundreds of millions of Han and other ethnic groups, which would be quite difficult. Therefore, the Manchu people adapted to new forms of social organization and absorbed and learned from the advanced political, economic, and cultural systems of the Central Plains. In the process of learning and integration, the language of the Manchus and Han nationalities blended in various activities. In order to facilitate communication, the Manchu language has more or less Chinese elements. Evaluation The Sinicization of the Manchus played a great role in stabilizing the national situation for the Qing Dynasty and establishing the foundation of the Qing Dynasty. For the integration of Manchu and Han, the following points can be summarized from the development of the Manchu-Chinese relationship in the Qing Dynasty. # The formation and growth of the Manchus has a close relationship with the absorption of the Han population. A large number of Han Chinese were incorporated into the Eight Banners, which effectively promoted the development of the Manchu. In 1644, after the Qing army entered the customs, the establishment of the Eight Banners was rapidly expanded. These inhaled Han people imported new blood into the Manchu community. They can also be said that they were Manchurian and played an important role in promoting the development of the Manchu. # The Manchus were enculturated into the Han culture, and the Manchus learn from each other and advance and retreat together. This is an inevitable trend of historical development. The close communication between Manchu and Han and the mixed people of Manchu and Han has effectively promoted the integration of the nation and the progress of the Manchu. # The Manchus have been martial and pragmatic in character since ancient times. The Han people were deeply influenced by the Four Books and the Five Classics and the Confucian traditional morality. Therefore, when the two meet, there will inevitably be conflicts. On the other hand, the rulers of the Manchu dynasty incorporated into the profound and profound Chinese culture unconsciously; on the other hand, under the psychological drive of maintaining the ancestral system, the rulers strive to maintain the national identity. Therefore, in such a large environment, Manchu culture constantly collides and merges. However, the Sinicization of the Manchu is not completed, it is a process of learning from the Han culture with the characteristics of the Manchu nationality. # The process of the Sinicization of the Manchus can be seen from another perspective as a process for the rulers of the Qing Dynasty to consolidate their rule. The rulers of the Qing Dynasty studied the official system of the Ming Dynasty politically, expanded the Eight Banners military system in the military, culturally respected Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism as the orthodoxy, and governed the country in a way other than Confucianism. It gradually settled local rebellions at all levels and established the feudal dynasty which lasted for 268 years. This is inseparable from the absorption, learning and utilization of Chinese culture. # In general, the Sinicization of Manchus expanded the cooperation of the Manchu ruling class and laid the foundation for the consolidation of the Qing Dynasty. It also promoted the national integration with the Han nationality as the main body and maintained the unity of the multi-ethnic countries. In summary, after long-term mixed living, mutual learning and intercommunication, the consistency of the production mode, class structure, language and customs between Manchu and Han is increasing, and the original difference is significantly reduced. After the middle period of the Qing Dynasty, in the political, economic, cultural and other aspects, the Manchus have developed to a level that is socially equal to the Han nationality, and the relationship between the Manchu and Han nationalities has become increasingly close. It can be said that the Sinicization of Manchus is a two-way integration of Manchu and Han nationality. This kind of integration promotes the development and prosperity of the two ethnic groups in politics, economy and culture.  Future Prospects  Despite the past glories of Manchu as a royal language, it is declining drastically and faces the risk of being extinct. By 1979 (post Cultural Revolution) there were only 2,000 Manchu people in the country who even dared to admit that they could speak Manchu, even less now. Efforts of revitalizing the language must be taken. Most schools in the country basically only teach Chinese, and few schools teaching minority languages are less than 5% of the education system. There are only two schools in the country that can teach Manchu, and it is even more difficult for the new generation of Manchus to receive their own education of their language. So today most of the Manchus cannot speak Manchu. Indeed, at the end of the Qing dynasty, even the most prominent people in the royal court were not able to speak Manchu. Therefore, actions must be taken. Education systems in China should be more open to diverse languages and foster awareness for different ethnic groups.

He was a prominent advocate for political freedom and democracy during the martial law era, but was also adamantly opposed to the Taiwan independence movement. As a professor at National Taiwan University, Hu taught many prominent scholars and future politicians, including President Ma Ying-jeou, Vice President Annette Lu and Premier Jiang Yi-huah. Considered an authority in political science and constitutional law, he was elected a member of Academia Sinica in 1998.  Biography  Hu was born on 14 May 1932 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Republic of China. He graduated from the Department of Law of National Taiwan University and obtained his master's degree in political science from Emory University in the United States. After returning to Taiwan, he taught in the Department of Political Science at National Taiwan University, specializing in constitutional law, political culture and election. During the Martial Law era, Hu was a strong advocate for political freedom and democracy and was frequently critical of the Kuomintang (KMT) government. Hu and three other liberal scholars, Yang Kuo-shu, , and Chang Chung-tung, were considered the \\"Four Bandits\\" or \\"Four Poisonous Weeds\\" by the government. After President Chiang Ching-kuo lifted the martial law in 1987, they founded the political group Taipei Society (ÊæÑÁ§æ, Chengshe) in 1989. Considered a pioneering authority of political science and constitutional law in Taiwan, Hu was elected as a member of Academia Sinica in 1998. Many of his students went on to become prominent politicians of both major parties of Taiwan, including President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Jiang Yi-huah of the KMT, and Vice President Annette Lu of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Many deans and professors of law and politics in Taiwanese universities were also his former students.  Political views  Although a frequent opponent and critic of the KMT, Hu, unlike many other liberal scholars, was adamantly against the Taiwan independence movement espoused by the DPP. In his view, although conditions were not yet ripe, in the long run reunification of Taiwan with mainland China was inevitable, and it was the only way to maintain peace. Hu argued that the political ideal of yitong, or a single unified state governing all regions, is deeply rooted in Chinese culture, and the abandonment of the ideal by many Taiwanese was a legacy of the Japanese colonial rule. He criticized those Taiwanese who deny their Chinese roots as \\"lacking morality\\", and believed that a \\"negotiated reunification\\" would eventually prevail.  Death  In August 2018, Hu sustained head injuries from a fall. After being hospitalized in the National Taiwan University Hospital for about a month, he died on 10 September 2018, at the age of 86. He was survived by four daughters. He died less than two months after Yang Kuo-shu, his former colleague at the Taipei Society.

Cooper and David Chyan of Cooper & Chyan Technology, Inc. (CCT) in 1989. The company and product were taken over by Cadence Design Systems in May 1997. Since its integration into Cadence's Allegro PCB Editor, the name of the router is Allegro PCB Router. The latest version is 17.2 (October 2016). Specctra routes boards by presenting graphical data using a \\"shape-based\\" technology which represents graphical objects not as a set of points- coordinates, but more compact. This increases the efficiency of routing printed circuit boards with a high density of components, provides automatic routing of the same chain of tracks of different widths and more. Specctra uses adaptive algorithms implemented in multiple trace runs. The routing is carried out in three stages: # preview routing # autoroute # additional processing of autoroute results On the first pass, the connection of all conductors is performed, regardless of the presence of conflicts, which consist in crossing the conductors on one layer and breaking the gaps. On each subsequent pass, the auto-router tries to reduce the number of conflicts by breaking and re-building connections (the ripup-and-retry router method) and pushing the conductors by pushing the neighboring ones (the push-and-shove router method). Electromagnetic compatibility can be tested in Specctra through the ‚ÄúSPECCTRAQuest SI Expert‚Äù module. The program is compatible with many design systems for printed circuit boards, thanks to the use of industrial-standard DSN design file format for project description and Do- files to specify routing strategies. The results are returned to the board editor via SES session files as well as RTE files. Protocol command execution is recorded in Did-file, which after editing can be used as new Do-files. The DSN/SES file formats are also supported by a number of other auto-routers including KONEKT ELECTRA, Eremex TopoR, Alfons Wirtz's FreeRouting and RL machine learning based DeepPCB.

Background Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, chief of the Clan Fraser of Lovat, had for a long time held back in committing himself to the Jacobite cause. However, according to historian Christopher Duffy he sent one of his leading clansmen, James Fraser of Foyers, to kidnap Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden who was the leader of the British-Hanoverian cause in the north-east of Scotland. Historian Sarah Fraser, however, states that Lovat did not want anything to do with the kidnapping of his old friend Duncan Forbes of Culloden. Sarah Fraser states that the Jacobite leader Charles Edward Stuart issued an order at Holyrood House on 23 September 1745 that was addressed to James Fraser of Foyers who was head of the aggressively Jacobite Stratherick men to carry Duncan Forbes as \\"prisoner to us at Edinburgh\\". Lovat actually wrote to Duncan Forbes informing him that he was about to be kidnapped and Forbes fortified and garrisoned Culloden House. The siege 200 of the Stratherrick Frasers advanced on the battlemented Culloden House. They were led by Fraser of Foyers and Fraser of Byerfield who was Lovat's aggressive chamberlain. According to Duffy they scampered off when they came under fire. As the Jacobites approached they were met with a rally of gunfire and a Swivel gun was also used to fire at them. According to Sarah Fraser, some of John Campbell, Lord Loudoun's men from his Independent Company had been on sentry duty who the Jacobites exchanged musket fire with, but as cannon balls tore into their cover, the Jacobites fled. The Jacobites had suffered one man killed. A search of the area the next day found another Jacobite who was wounded and who confessed that they had been led by James Fraser of Foyers and had been sent by Lord Lovat. According to Alexander Mackenzie's History of the Frasers of Lovat, the Stratherrick men failed to take Culloden House, referring to it as the Castle of Culloden, which was strongly fortified and had several pieces of cannon on its ramparts. Aftermath According to Sarah Fraser, Lovat wrote to Duncan Forbes apologising for the \\"base barbarous, inhuman, and distracted attempt and behaviour\\" of the Stratherick men at Culloden House. Lovat also said that his son, the Master of Lovat, was on the point of leaving to join the rebels, taking hundreds with him, and that he was powerless to stop him. Lord Loudoun (John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun) who supported the British-Hanoverian Government, suspecting the loyalty of Lord Lovat, sent an expedition to Castle Downie on 11 December 1745 where they captured Lovat and brought him back as a prisoner to Inverness. However, Lovat escaped to freedom on the night of 19 December 1745. According to historian Ruairidh MacLeod, the reaction in the Highlands to the unsuccessful attempt of James Fraser of Foyers to capture or kill the Lord President Forbes at Culloden House, was of profound shock. In April 1746, the Jacobite leader Charles Edward Stuart requisitioned Culloden House and used it as his headquarters in the days leading up to the more famous Battle of Culloden that brought an end to the Jacobite rising. Notes *A The source from Sarah Fraser refers to the Independent Highland Companies that were raised by Duncan Forbes of Culloden, however Lord Loudoun had his own companies of soldiers in Loudon's Highlanders who were also \\"independent\\" at this time as they were not regimented until 1747 and therefore they are often confused with the Independent Highland Companies raised by Forbes of Culloden.

Antennae are mostly dark brown. At rest, they may be kept between the wings and the legs. The body shows the same color as the head, but the first part is usually slightly brownish. The body and the wings are quite hairy.Arts Data Banken This species is rather similar to Megalomus tortricoides, that is slightly bigger, with a maculation of the front and back wings clear and only slightly contrasted. Moreover the females can be separated only on the basis of tiny differences. Biology Adults fly from June to August. The eggs are usually laid on the underside of leaves. After about four weeks the mature larvae spins a candy cocoon. This species is overwintering as a pupa. It has one or two generations a year. Megalomus hirtus is linked almost exclusively to broad-leaved trees, with a preference for Corylus species. In UK it should have some kind of association with wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia), that usually grows on rocky slopes. The larvae are active predators on aphids or on the larvae of other small insects that have wood sage as host plant.

It originally aired on PBS Kids in the United States on February 12, 2018. \\"Arthur Takes a Stand\\" was written by Peter Hirsch and storyboarded by Cilbur Rocha. In the episode, Arthur learns that his school's lunch lady, Mrs. MacGrady, has to do all her work by herself. He attempts to get the principal to hire an assistant for her, but his request is denied. Through advice and encouragement from his friend Sue Ellen and civil rights leader John Lewis, Arthur gets the rest of his class to participate in a sit- in protest. Plot In school, principal Ms. Tingley announces that breakfast will be served in the school cafeteria, and that civil rights leader John Lewis will be visiting the school. The next morning, the students enjoy the breakfast, and Arthur talks to Mrs. MacGrady after it is served. He is surprised to learn that she does all the cafeteria work by herself, without any assistance. Arthur goes to the principal's office and asks Ms. Tingley to hire more cafeteria staff, and she answers that the school does not have the budget for it. Arthur's friend Sue Ellen suggests that he start a boycott. Arthur goes to Mrs. MacGrady with a \\"Boycott Breakfast\\" poster, although she states that serving breakfast was her own decision. In the library, Arthur has a nightmare where Mrs. MacGrady is overworked from breakfast being served 24 hours a day; he awakes to find John Lewis sitting at the table with him. Lewis advises Arthur to be persistent in his protesting. After breakfast the next day, Arthur continues to sit at his table, starting a sit-in protest. Mrs. MacGrady joins him, agreeing that not getting any help is unfair. The entire class slowly joins Arthur's protest. Ms. Tingley enters and demands them to stop; however, Mrs. MacGrady refuses to leave until she is guaranteed to get an assistant. Lewis enters and recognizes Mrs. MacGrady as an old friend from the March on Washington, also joining the sit-in. Finally, Ms. Tingley decides to write to the school board and request more money. Lewis tells Arthur, \\"There's nothing more important than following your conscience. If you can do that, you're always going to sleep well\\" as the episode ends. Production Marc Brown, creator of the Arthur franchise, had met Lewis at the National Press Club and got the idea to have him appear on the show. Carol Greenwald, executive producer of Arthur, wrote that Lewis was excited to appear on the show, although he corrected facts about his history in the writing and rejected initial character designs. In one, he was depicted as \\"a really cuddly teddy bear\\"; Lewis denied it, stating that \\"I just don't look like that\\" and opting for a more realistic design. However, during Lewis's voice line recording sessions, Greenwald was impressed by \\"his warmth and his openness and also just his willingness to jump in and have some fun.\\" The writer of \\"Arthur Takes a Stand,\\" Peter Hirsch, described that the episode aims to \\"explore how a young kid can protest.\\" In order to teach \\"one, how to protest, and two, empathy,\\" the episode is about \\"Arthur [identifying] an injustice that [is]n't necessarily happening to him and to feel strongly enough to want to do something about it.\\" In writing the episode, Hirsch was careful to \\"have a little bit of bite but not be so out there that the kids [a]re putting themselves in jeopardy.\\" Greenwald said that the episode is \\"definitely is in line with all that we‚Äôve done always on Arthur, which is to bring in diverse viewpoints and interesting guest stars and think about topics that a lot of other kids‚Äô series might not.\\" In the episode, Mrs. MacGrady is revealed to have been a political activist. Hirsch described that this was \\"perfect\\" for the character, as the staff \\"had always envisioned her as a child of the ‚Äô60s. She's a lot hipper than you would know unless you talked to her.\\" Reception After the episode's release, Greenwald noted that it received \\"a lot of really positive responses,\\" but also a few about \\"people saying we shouldn't be showing kids stuff like this.\\" She responded that \\"not all kids\\" can be \\"protected from these issues,\\" and that \\"[t]hat's part of what our goal with Arthur is, to be sharing these experiences broadly so kids of all kinds can understand and build empathy.\\" Legacy An animated short titled \\"Arthur on Racism: Talk, Listen, and Act\\" was produced in memory of John Lewis in August 2020. In the video, Arthur and Buster ask Mrs. MacGrady what they can do to help fight racism. The short was written in response to the death of George Floyd in May 2020, and features Arthur and Buster's solemn reactions to watching a video implied to be of Floyd's death. After John Lewis's death, the Arthur Facebook account made a post commemorating Lewis, and \\"Arthur Takes a Stand\\" was made available for free on the PBS Kids website and app. References External links * Arthur (TV series) 2018 American television episodes Television episodes about civil rights movement ","title":"Arthur Takes a Stand"},{"id":"58819051","text":"Portrait of Thomas Hobbes Thomas Hobbes‚Äôs moral and political philosophy is constructed around the basic premise of social and political order, explaining how humans should live in peace under a sovereign power so as to avoid conflict within the ‚Äòstate of nature‚Äô. Hobbes‚Äôs moral philosophy and political philosophy are intertwined; his moral thought is based around ideas of human nature, which determine the interactions that make up his political philosophy. Hobbes‚Äôs moral philosophy therefore provides justification for, and informs, the theories of sovereignty and the state of nature that underpin his political philosophy. In utilising methods of deductive reasoning and motion science, Hobbes examines human emotion, reason and knowledge to construct his ideas of human nature (moral philosophy). This methodology critically influences his politics, determining the interactions of conflict (in the state of nature) which necessitate the creation of a politically authoritative state to ensure the maintenance of peace and cooperation. This method is used and developed in works such as The Elements of Law (1640), De Cive (1642), Leviathan (1651) and Behemoth (1681).  Methodology  In developing his moral and political philosophy, Hobbes assumes the methodological approach of deductive reasoning, combining mathematics and the mechanics of science to formulate his ideas on human nature. Hobbes was critical of the assumptions of scholastic philosophers, whose evidence for human nature was based upon Aristotelian metaphysics and Cartesian observation, as opposed to reasoning and definition. Though Hobbes did not fully reject the value of observational or ‚Äòprudential‚Äô knowledge, he dismissed the view that this was at all scientific or philosophical in nature. To Hobbes, this type of knowledge was based on subjective and diverse experience, and was therefore capable of producing only speculative assumptions. This view predetermined Hobbes‚Äôs method of deductive reasoning, which involved the application of geometry, Galilean scientific concepts and definition. This scientific method stresses the importance of first establishing well-defined principles of human nature (moral philosophy) and ‚Äòdeducing‚Äô aspects of political life from this. Hobbes first used the mechanics of motion to define principles of human perception, behaviour and reasoning, which were then used to draw the conclusions of his political philosophy (sovereignty, state of nature). In rejecting what he believed were ‚Äòconjectures‚Äô relating to intangible or supernatural objects or realities, Hobbes‚Äôs philosophy is drawn from material and physical reality and experience. H√∂ffe explains how Hobbes applied this method to construct his political theory of sovereignty: ‚Äú‚Ä¶the combination of mathematics and mechanics, is not sufficient on its own‚Ä¶ the combination of mathematics and mechanics leads to the metaphor of the state as an ‚Äúartificial‚Äù human being, which is comparable to a machine constructed out of natural human beings; (3) the resoluto-compositive [the recourse to absolutely first principles or elements] method defines and clarifies the nature of this construction: the artificial human being is decomposed into its smallest constituent parts and then recomposed, i.e., constructed, out of these parts\\". Hobbes‚Äôs moral principles thus provide the ultimate basis for his political philosophy, defining and clarifying how an ‚Äúartificial‚Äù sovereign authority may come into existence.  Moral philosophy  Hobbes‚Äôs moral philosophy is the fundamental starting point from which his political philosophy is developed. This moral philosophy outlines a general conceptual framework on human nature which is rigorously developed in The Elements of Law, De Cive and Leviathan. These works examine how the laws of motion influence human perception, behaviour and action, which then determine how individuals interact. The Elements of Law provides insight into Hobbes‚Äôs moral philosophy through ideas of sensation, pleasure, passion, pain, memory and reason. This is expanded upon in De Cive: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ human nature‚Ä¶ comprising the faculties of body and mind; . . . Physical force, Experience Reason and Passion\\". Hobbes believes that as sensory organs process the movements of external stimuli, a range of different mental experiences take place, which in turn dictate human behaviour. What emerged from this idea of motion was the view that humans are naturally drawn towards, or desire, things that benefit their overall wellbeing; things that are ‚Äúgood‚Äù for them. These are called ‚Äúappetites‚Äù, and what differentiates the human ‚Äòappetite‚Äô from that of animals is reason. Reason, or ‚Äúratiocination‚Äù, as used by Hobbes, was not defined in the traditional sense as an innate capability tied to notions of natural law, but as an activity that involved coming to a judgement via the process of logic. Humans, as noted in Leviathan, have ‚Äú‚Ä¶knowledge of the consequences of one affirmation to another‚Äù. Individuals will desire and select whatever ‚Äòthing‚Äô brings them the most ‚Äúgood‚Äù. This process of thinking is a consequence of motion and mechanics more than a conscious exercise of choice. Ratiocination leads individuals to uncover the Laws of Nature, which Hobbes deems ‚Äúthe true moral philosophy‚Äù. Hobbes‚Äôs understanding of human nature establishes the foundations for his political philosophy by explaining the essence of conflict (in the state of nature) and cooperation (in a commonwealth). Because human beings will always pursue what is ‚Äògood‚Äô for them, this philosophy asserts that individuals share overarching desires or goals, such as security and safety (especially from death). This is the point in which Hobbes‚Äôs moral and political philosophy intersect: in ‚Äúour shared conception of ourselves as rational agents‚Äù. It is rational to ‚Äúpursue the necessary means to our dominant shared ends‚Äù, in which case the ‚Äúnecessary means‚Äù is submission to a sovereign authority. By establishing morality as a force which directs individuals towards their shared desires and goals of, for example, peace and security, and the means to achieve these goals is through the creation of a state, Hobbes grounds his political philosophy in his moral thought. This approach to moral philosophy is executed by Hobbes through discussion of a range of interrelated moral concepts: ‚Äúgood, evil, rights, obligation, justice, contract, covenant and natural law‚Äù.  Moral concepts   Obligation  Hobbes‚Äôs concept of moral obligation stems from the assumption that humans have a fundamental obligation to follow the laws of nature and all obligations stem from nature. His reasoning for this is premised upon the beliefs of natural law; that the moral standards or reasoning that govern behaviour can be drawn from eternal truths regarding human nature and the world. Hobbes believes that the morals derived from natural law, however, do not permit individuals to challenge the laws of the sovereign; law of the commonwealth supersedes natural law, and obeying the laws of nature does not make you exempt from disobeying those of the government. Hobbes‚Äôs concept of moral obligation thus intertwines with the concept of political obligation. This underpins much of Hobbes‚Äôs political philosophy, stating that humans have a political obligation or ‚Äòduty‚Äô to prevent the creation of a state of nature. Humans have a political obligation to obey a sovereign power, and once they have renounced part of their natural rights to this power (theory of sovereignty), they have a duty to uphold the ‚Äòsocial contract‚Äô they have entered into.  Political philosophy  thumb|Frontispiece from the first edition of Leviathan (1651) which serves as a visual representation of Hobbes's idea of the state. The city pictured in the foreground of the image represents civilisation, while the salient figure (Leviathan), with a sword and crosier in hand, personifies sovereignty and the omnipotent state, possessing the authority to represent the collective will of the people. The main aspects of Hobbes‚Äôs political philosophy revolve around the contrasting relationship between the state of nature (a state of war) and the State itself as one of peace and cooperation. This philosophy is determined by, and implied in, his method of deduction. The trajectory of individual desire and will outlined in his moral philosophy is a decisive factor contributing to the formulation of his idea of the State. Hobbes outlined four key principles of purpose in his philosophical literature: # Welfare of the general public. # State of well-being and satisfaction with life. # The pursuit of justice. # The pursuit of peace (to avoid the ‚Äòstate of war‚Äô). These concepts are mutually reinforcing and feature across his most prominent works. For example, in The Elements of Law, Hobbes claims that the benefits given to the general public under a commonwealth are ‚Äúincomparable‚Äù. This overlaps with his discussion of justice in the same text, which is used in a political context. Leviathan details all four principles but focuses on the pursuit of peace, which Hobbes aligns with the first principle of welfare and public good. Where a state of peace (4) and justice (3), and the overall welfare of the general public (1), manifest under a commonwealth (stemming from ‚Äòcommonweal‚Äô: the general good of the public), a state of well-being and overall satisfaction (2) may be secured. Only under the commonwealth (as opposed to a state of nature and war) can peace, and ‚Äúthe notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice‚Äù, exist indefinitely. This is expanded upon again in The Elements of Law, which posits that humans by nature are inclined towards conflict, and therefore need a State to institute peace and protect individuals against the threats of self-preservation which flourish in a state of nature. De Cive also builds on the relationship between these principles, where Hobbes‚Äôs claim to show individuals the ‚Äúhighway to peace‚Äù affirms his notion that humans should pursue peace, and therefore justice, in the form of a commonwealth. It is in the interest of humans to pursue peace, who have a fundamental obligation to follow the Laws of Nature. A sovereign power or authority figure - a Leviathan - is needed to translate these Laws of Nature in a ‚Äúbinding and authoritative fashion‚Äù. The notion that individuals require a ‚Äúvisible power to keep them in awe‚Äù - to maintain peace and safety through enforcement of law - underpins Hobbes‚Äôs theory of sovereignty, which proposes that a sovereign ruler (with authority to govern the people) is fundamental to any type of commonwealth. Therefore, the overarching concern of Hobbes‚Äôs political philosophy remains the capacity of the government to maintain peace, protection, justice and wellbeing in a manner that ensures the continuation of society and civil life.

The attack was the start of a military operation which resulted in the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. Battle Indonesian navy vessels consisting of frigate KRI Ratulangi, corvette KRI Barakuda, destroyer escort KRI Martadinata and repair ship KRI Jaya Wijaya arrived off the coast of Dili around 02:00. Two Portuguese Navy frigate NRP Afonso de Albuquerque and corvette Jo√£o Roby were also present, but the ships had covered its cannons and did not engage the Indonesians. On 03:00, city lights of Dili were turned off - which the Indonesian commander took as a sign that the ships had been discovered - and the ships shelled the city. The landing ship KRI Teluk Bone was also present, carrying several hundred Timorese partisans and regular Indonesian marines. Around 04:30, 400 Indonesian marines landed in amphibious tanks and personnel carriers in Kampung Alor beach. They faced minimal resistance, and by 07:00 they had secured the surrounding areas. The paratroopers consisted of 550 soldiers in ten Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft which took off from Iswahyudi Air Force Base in Madiun. They originated from Kopassus' (then Kopasandha) paratrooper command and Kostrad's 501th infantry battalion. The planes approached Dili from the east and began dropping soldiers on 05:45. One loadmaster was killed by FRETILIN fire, and 72 soldiers aborted the drop. The paratroopers was shot at before they reached ground, following orders from Gama, and was exposed to friendly fire from the marines. After the first sortie was dropped, the planes returned to Penfui airfield in Kupang, and a second sortie comprising five planes was launched. The second wave of paratroopers, however, proceeded to fire at Indonesian soldiers moving towards Dili airfield while the marines began also fired upon them. According to official reports, the friendly fire incident resulted in no fatalities. Casualties and aftermath Following the battle, the Indonesian casualty count was 35 killed from the first sortie, and another 22 from the second sortie. On the FRETILIN side, Indonesian forces reported 122 killed and 365 captured. Three days after the battle, the city of Baucau was similarly attacked and captured.

During this time, Nazi Germany shifted from the post-World War I society which characterized the Weimar Republic and introduced an ideology of \\"biological racism\\" into the country's legal and justicial systems. The shift from the traditional legal system (the \\"normative state\\") to the Nazis' ideological mission (the \\"prerogative state\\") enabled all of the subsequent acts of the Hitler regime, including its atrocities) to be performed \\"legally\\". For this to succeed, the normative judicial system needed to be reworked; judges, lawyers and other civil servants acclimatized themselves to the new Nazi laws and personnel.  History  Hitler in 1937 After World War I, Germany considered the law a \\"most respected entity\\" as the country regained stability and public confidence. Many German lawyers and judges were Jewish. Adolf Hitler was inspired by Benito Mussolini's October 1922 March on Rome, which brought Mussolini's National Fascist Party to power in Italy. Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch took place in Munich, Bavaria, on 8‚Äì9 November 1923. The attempted coup was halted by Bavarian police; 16 Nazis were killed, and Hitler was imprisoned (where he wrote Mein Kampf). Hitler exploited Weimar's economic hardships, which included hyperinflation and the effects of the Great Depression. His actions and goals have been described as using the \\"constitution to destroy the constitution\\" and the \\"rules of the republic to destroy the republic\\". Nazi influence increased after the party became the largest in the Reichstag. Increasing public pressure, including marches, lawlessness and racism, forced president Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933; this was known as the Machtergreifung. The Reichstag building in flames The 27 February 1933 Reichstag fire was used as a pretext to suspend the Weimar Constitution and impose a four-year state of emergency. The Reichstag Fire Decree would \\"safeguard public security\\" by restricting civil liberties and granting increased power to the police, and the SA arrested 4,000 members of the Communist Party. Legislative power was given to Hitler so his government could create laws without Rechstag consent. Several principles were invoked during the state of emergency. The F√ºhrerprinzip (\\"leader principle\\") designated Hitler as above the law. The Volkist Principle of Racial Inequality organised the judiciary by race; anyone not considered part of the Volksgemeinschaft (people's community) was seen as undeserving of legal protection. In 1933, The Reich Ministry of the Interior (RMI) was utilised by the Nazi government to consolidate Hitler's rise to power. New civil-service legislation enabled the removal of non-Aryans and the \\"politically unreliable.\\" Autonomy was removed from individual German states and provinces through a process of coordination (Gleichschaltung), and Nazi ideology was imposed by racial and ancestral legislation which defined who was (or was not) a German. In 1936, SS leader and RMI state secretary Heinrich Himmler was placed in charge of the civil police. With the growth of Nazi Germany, the RMI organized the administration of newly-acquired countries and territories. During the Night of the Long Knives, which began on 30 June 1934, 80 stormtrooper leaders and other opponents of Hitler were arrested and shot. Von Hindenberg's death on 2 August 1934 enabled Hitler to usurp his presidential powers, and his dictatorship was built upon his position as Reich president (head of state), Reich Chancellor (head of government) and F√ºhrer (leader of the Nazi Party). The 9‚Äì10 November 1938 Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) had attacks on synagogues and Jewish businesses and citizens. Over 100 were killed, and thousands were arrested.\\"Remembering Kristallnacht\\". The Jerusalem Report. 2008 ‚Äì via ProQuest. Two hundred sixty-seven synagogues in Germany, Austria and the Sudetenland were destroyed; firefighters were instructed to only prevent the flames from spreading. About 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and imprisoned or interned in concentration camps. The government blamed the Jewish people for the attacks, and imposed a fine of one billion ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥. After Kristallnacht, additional decrees removed the Jews from German economic and social life; those who could emigrated.  Laws  After the Reichstag Fire Decree, the Enabling Act of 1933 amended the Weimar Constitution to allow Hitler and his government to enact laws (even laws violating the constitution) without going through the Reichstag. Nazi intimidation of the opposition resulted in a vote of 444 to 94.  Flag law  According to the Reich flag law, Germany's national colors were black, red and white and its flag incorporated the swastika. In the words of Hitler, this was to \\"repay a debt of gratitude to the movement under whose symbol Germany regained its freedom, fulfilling a significant item on the program of the National Socialist Party\\".Friedlander, Saul (1997). Nazi Germany and The Jews. HarperCollins, p. 142. .  Nuremberg Laws  Jewish marriage chart according to the Nuremberg Laws When Germany was completely under Nazi rule, the number and severity of laws increased. The Nuremberg Laws were announced after the annual Nazi party rally in Nuremberg on 15 September 1935. The two laws authorized arrests of, and violence against, Jews. Initially imposed in Germany, Nazi expansion during the Second World War resulted in the imposition of the Nuremberg Laws in occupied territories.  Citizenship Law  The Citizenship Law specified to whom full political rights would be granted and those who would be denied them. Only citizens, with \\"German or related blood\\", received these rights; Jews, \\"foreigners in their own country\\" who were now Staatsangeh√∂rige (state subjects), were denied them.Bankier, David (1992). The Germans and the Final Solution. pp. 41‚Äì42. .  Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor  This law had five articles: # Marriages between Jews and Germans or relatives were forbidden, and existing marriages of this kind were void. # Sexual relations outside marriage between Jews and Germans or relatives were forbidden. # Jews were not allowed to employ female German citizens or relatives as domestic servants. # Jews were forbidden to display the national flag and/or colours # Violations of the first article were punishable by hard labor; violations of the second article were punishable by imprisonment, and violations of the third article were punishable by fine and imprisonment. A 14 November 1935 supplemental decree defined Jewishness. No longer limited to religious beliefs, the decree classified those who followed the Jewish faith, belonged to the Jewish religion when the decree was promulgated, or later entered the Jewish religion, anyone who had three or more Jewish grandparents or two Jewish grandparents and was married to a Jewish spouse and anyone who joined a Jewish community as Jewish, regardless of whether they still followed the religion.Friedlander, Saul (1997). Nazi Germany and the Jews. HarperCollins. p. 149. Nineteen hundred \\"special Jewish laws\\" emphasized Aryan morality and antisemitic stereotypes of \\"Jewish counter-morality\\". Jewish lawyers and notaries had been prohibited from working for the city of Nuremberg in a 1933 decree, and Nazi ideology continue to creep into the legal system: * The use of Jewish names for spelling in telephone delivery of telegrams was banned (22 April 1933). * Non-Aryans could not be lay judges or jury members (13 November 1933). * The perception that Aryan students were receiving assistance from Jews in preparing their exams must end (4 April 1935). * The kosher slaughter of animals was prohibited. * Sports laws prohibiting Jewish boxing and public swimming For a brief period before and during the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, antisemitic laws and attacks were moderated and discriminatory signage removed. Although this was regarded as an attempt by Hitler to appease the international audience and limit criticism and interference, nearly all German Jewish athletes were excluded from Olympic competition.  Later antisemitic laws  According to historian Saul Friedl√§nder, the \\"fateful turning point\\" was reached in 1938 and 1939Friedlander, Saul (1997). Nazi Germany and The Jews. HarperCollins. p. 180. with the passage of additional laws which used economic harassment and violence to drive Jews from Germany and Austria: * Jewish physicians were de- certified, and were no longer allowed to treat German patients. * Jews were not allowed to own gardens. * All streets in Germany were renamed. * Jews were prohibited from cinemas, the opera, and concerts. * Jewish children were banned from public schools. * Robbing Jews became legal, and Jews were forced to surrender \\"all jewellery of any value\\".Efron, Weitzman, Lehmann, John, Steven, Matthias (2004). The Jews: A History. Pearson Education Inc. pp. 410‚Äì411. .  Legal system  Roland Freisler (center) in the People's Court In Nazi Germany, the civil service provided a legal framework to deprive Jews of their rights. Opportunities to create anti-Jewish policies were coveted and career bureaucrats came together and developed increasingly radical policies. Their familiarity with the legal system enabled them to easily manipulate it. The judiciary lost its independence as it was increasingly controlled by the Nazis. Judges who did not join the National Socialist League for the Maintenance of Law were dismissed. Jewish lawyers and judges and those with socialist or other views inconvenient to the Nazi Party were removed. The fundamental legal principle became Nazi \\"common sense\\", \\"Whatever is good for Germany is legal\\". The People's Court () was created in 1934 for people accused of political crimes. In 1938, all crimes began to be tried in the court; in 1939, its remit was expanded to include minor offenses. Roland Freisler, appointed in 1942 as judge and interrogator, was infamous for \\"berating and belittling\\" defendants and lawyers. Statutes were \\"systematically misinterpreted‚Äù, and the court has been described as committing \\"judicial murders\\". Separation of defendants and lawyers was calculated to prevent communication, and defense presentations were often interrupted. Courts were made up of three judges; all verdicts were final, and the convicted defendant was immediately executed. The 20 July plot in 1944 was accompanied by a series of aggressive prosecutions, and over 110 death sentences were imposed in fifty trials.  Nuremberg trials  Defendants at the Nuremberg trials After the end of World War II, the Nuremberg trials were conducted in 1945 and 1946 to bring Nazi war criminals to justice. The Nuremberg Charter, decreeing an International Military Tribunal (IMT), was announced on 8 August 1945 to conduct 13 trials made up of judges from the United States, Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union. Article six of the charter outlines the crimes for which Nazi officials would be tried: # Conspiracy to commit charges two, three, and four below # Crimes against peace ‚Äì participation in the planning and waging of a war of aggression in violation of international treaties # War crimes ‚Äì violations of the internationally agreed-on rules for waging war # Crimes against humanity ‚Äì murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war, or persecution on political, racial, or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where it was perpetrated. Twenty-four Nazi officials were indicted for these crimes on 6 October 1945, including Hermann Goring (Hitler's designated heir), Rudolf Hess (Nazi deputy leader), Joachim von Ribbentrop (foreign minister), and Wilhelm Keitel (head of the armed forces). Verdicts included 12 death sentences, three life imprisonments, four prison terms of 10‚Äì20 years and three acquittals. Those acquitted were Hjalmar Schacht (economics minister), former vice-chancellor Franz von Papen, and Hans Fritzsche (head of press and radio).

Whilst performing house-to-house visits as part of her campaign for election to Lane Cove Council Mrs Leach realised there was an enormous lack of community-based assistance. This led to her establishing the Pool of Service in 1959, which later became LCCAS. In 1962 LCCAS became independent from Lane Cove Council. Since then LCCAS has developed a wide service base. The first programs introduced by LCCAS were Meals on Wheels and the Home Companion Service, a precursor to the current Nursing Service. Both programs began in the 1960s and continue to this day. In 1982 LCCAS introduced a Welfare Counselling service and later in 1983 the Friends of Community Aid Shop was opened and began raising funds through monthly craft projects. In order to meet increasing demand LCCAS began to introduce a greater variety of services. Home Maintenance and Modification Services began in 1987. Between 2002 and 2004 the organisation introduced the Easy-Care Gardening Service, the In-Home Podiatry Service and Linen Service. Later LCCAS received funding to extend services to people living in the local government areas (LGAs) of Mosman, North Sydney and Willoughby. Following this expansion, the organisation was renamed to Lane Cove and North Side Community Services (LCNSCS).  History of Hunters Hill Ryde Community Services (HHRCS)  HHRCS, originally Gladesville Community Aid and Information Service Inc., was founded by several prominent residents and business owners of the Gladesville area. Each business donated ¬£10 towards the first budget and these funds were used to open a community center, which was founded on the 24th of November 1966. The center moved between three different locations before the headquarters were officially opened in Cowell Street Gladesville in 1975. The Hunters Hill Respite Care Centre was officially opened in 1990 at the St Joseph Hostel and in 1995 was moved to its current location at 42 Gladesville Road. In 1999 the Neighbourhood Centre opened at 46 Gladesville Road where it also remains to this day. Throughout these relocations the organisation established and expanded its program and service base. Several key programs include, Meals on Wheels which began in 1967, migrant conversation groups in 1979, Learning for Leisure in 1983 and the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) program in 2006. In 2008 Gladesville Community Aid and Information Service Inc, Hunters Hill Respite Care Centre Inc and the Brain Injury Respite Development Service Inc amalgamated and became Hunters Hill Ryde Community Services (HHRCS).  History of Sydney Community Services (SCS)  Established in 2017 SCS has a relatively recent history as an organisation. Its headquarters are located at Pottery Lane in Lane Cove. However, the offices and community centres that established HHRCS also remain open and continue in their provision of services. SCS now provides services to people living in the Lane Cove, Ryde and Hunters Hill LGA's. However, some programs such as Social Support, CALD and Podiatry services are offered to the whole of Northern Sydney.  Services and Programs  SCS provides ‚Äòsupport and assistance to those who are elderly, frail, socially isolated, people with a disability or experiencing financial disadvantage in the community‚Äô. There are three distinct groups that SCS provides services to, Seniors, Persons with Disabilities and the broader Community. SCS provides ‚Äòsupport and assistance to those who are elderly, frail, socially isolated, people with a disability or experiencing financial disadvantage in the community‚Äô.  Seniors  A range of services are available for seniors, who are those aged 65 and over. First and foremost, SCS functions as a Community Advisory Service, providing information about community services as well as government programs, such as NDIS funded services, Targeted Early Intervention Programs as well as My Aged Care and Home Care Packages. Several programs are run aiming to assist the unpaid primary carers of seniors. Carers Support Groups are available for carers of a person with an aged-related condition. These groups seek to provide information, support, advocacy and regular breaks from the caring role. The Flexible Respite Service ensures carers can take regular breaks from their caring role by providing support to care recipients either in home or in the community. The service involves home visits, accompanied outings, assistance in accomplishing a particular task such as a hobby and phone monitoring services. The Seniors Hub is based in Hunters Hill and is open Mondays to Fridays. Programs are run daily and include a range of activities for seniors, such as outings, exercise, music, craft, games, picnics and special events. SCS also provides various home-based services. These include the, Community Visitors Program, Home Delivered Meals, Shopping Assistance and a Linen Service. Further health focused services include, the Nursing and Podiatry programs. Gardening and Home Modification and Maintenance Services are run to help with the general up keep of people's gardens and homes when they are no longer able to do so themselves.  Persons With Disabilities  The services that SCS provides for people with a lifelong disability are made available through the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Many of the same services that are available for seniors are also available for people with disabilities. SCS runs Center-Based Programs from several locations in both the Hunters Hill and Lane Cove LGA's. Community Engagement programs, such as social clubs, outings and theatre ensemble ‚ÄúDifferent Degrees‚Äù are also run and aim to involve clients in their local communities. Also available are Shopping Services, Homes Delivered Meals and Linen Services. As are Gardening Services and Home Modification and Maintenance Services. Health focused services include Home Nursing, Podiatry and Medical Transport.  Community  The Community Connections programs offered by SCS are mainly tailored towards seniors, however these programs are open to any member of the community. SCS offers a variety of wellness and physical activities, including walking groups, table tennis, older women's wellness, Men's Shed and shuffle board. Further social activities are available and include the Seniors Hub, scrabble group, bridge and chess, book club, learning for leisure and mah- jong. SCS also organises and runs social events, such as day trips, the BOOMers group and the Park View Caf√©.  Funding  Funding for SCS comes from the Commonwealth Government, State Government, Local Government, Independent Funding Sources and Fundraising. The organisation also has several supporters, such as local businesses, who contribute in a variety of different ways, offering valuable resources and expertise. Funding Break Down for SCS 2018/19.  Government Funding   Commonwealth Government Funding  Commonwealth funding comes through the Department of Health (DoH). The DoH funds services for people over the age of 65 through several programs, including the Commonwealth Home Support Program (CHSP) and Community Visitors Scheme (CVS). Furthermore, SCS has status as an approved provider of services funded through the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Those covered by NDIS are able to purchase services and support from SCS that are outlined in their assessed Support Plan. The CHSP accounts for over 50% of SCS's funding.‚ÄúSCS Funding Break Down‚Äù, SCS The CHSPis a consolidated program that provides basic home support for older persons that require assistance to keep living independently at home and to remain active members of the community. The CHSP brought together the Commonwealth Home and Community Care (HACC) Program, the National Respite for Careers Program (NRCP), the Day Therapy Centers (DTC) Program and the Assistance with Care and Housing for the Aged (ACHA) Program. The NDIS provides support for Australians with a disability. NDIS funding is available to persons under the age of 65 with a permanent and significant disability. The scheme seeks to provide such persons with the reasonable and necessary social and economic support they need to live an ordinary life.  State Government Funding  Further funding is provided by the New South Wales State Government through programs run by the Department of Family and Community Services, such as the Community Builders Program. The Community Builders Program provides funding for services that strengthen and build community connections, for example through local community centres.  Local Government Funding  Local Government funding is sourced from the three LGA's that SCS services. Those are the Lane Cove Council, City of Ryde Council and Hunters Hill Council. This funding is secured through regular grant application processes.  Private Funding   Independent Funding  Independent funding is provided by a range of organisations. This includes a number of local RSL Clubs who provide funding through the Clubs NSW Grant Scheme. These RSL clubs include Chatswood, Gladesville, North Ryde and Ryde Eastwood Leagues Club. Street Smart is another group providing funding to SCS and its programs.  Fundraising  SCS also raises its own funds through a variety of events, including the Hunters Hill Food and Wine Festival and annual raffles.  Supporters  Support for SCS is not restricted to funds-based assistance. SCS receives a variety of support from a diverse array of organisations and business. Current supporters are listed below: * Bakers Delight * Discover Hunters Hill * Holden * IGA * Rotary Club of Lane Cove * Rotary International * Hunters Hill Rotary Club * Lane Cove Countryy Club * URM * LJHooker * Anglican Parish of Hunters Hill * Grill‚Äôd * GladesHill Presbyterian Church * Ciena * Westpac * Dooley's Lidcome Catholic Club * Sea Horse Society * Hunters Hill quilters * Marist Fathers Association * Longueville Hotel  The Future of Funding  The Living Longer Living Better Federal reforms for aged care is drastically changing the way in which federal funding is provided to the aged care sector. The reforms will see the entire sector shift into Integrated Care at Home Package Programs by 2020. Therefore, a large proportion of SCS's services will be funded differently in the near future.  Volunteers  Volunteers are a crucial aspect of SCS's ability to provide its services, and as such are regarded as \\"the most valued members of our organisation\\". As for many not-for-profits volunteering is a significant aspect of the continued provision of services, which are being demand at increasing rates nationwide. In order to provide its services SCS has a team of over 400 volunteers. These volunteers fulfil a variety of roles supporting the programs that SCS runs either on its own or as part of government programs. Volunteers assist vulnerable members of the community, including those with a disability, the frail and the elderly by connecting them to valuable support services and also to the community.  Priorities  SCS's Mission is \\"to enhance people's quality of life and independence by providing a range of health and community services\\".

Its primary function is the conservation of marine ecosystems through lobbying for regulations concerning overfishing, and revitalising fish populations. It is the largest organisation in the United States dedicated to sustainable fishing. The organisation has undertaken lobbying to shift the United States' fishing regulation from exploitation- orientated to conservation-and-rehabilitation-orientated. It is made up of a number of smaller fishermen, conservation and scientist groups. The Marine Fish Conservation Network also has an associated blog, which covers topics such as current issues affecting marine ecosystems, as well as other marine ecosystem related articles. The current executive director of the Marine Fish Conservation Network is Robert Vandermark. History The Marine Fish Conservation Network was founded in 1993 in an attempt to reverse the decline in fish populations, particularly through the 1980s. In particular, this was done by campaigning for major legislation changes, in the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 and the amendment of the Magnuson‚ÄìStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act 2006. They have also been involved in fundraising to ensure the enforcement of the regulations, as well as producing a series of reports into the effectiveness of these legislative changes. Achievements The main achievements of the Marine Fish Conservation Network are underpinned by their campaigning to alter laws and regulations surrounding fishing, from exploitation towards conservation. The two main regulations changes campaigned for by the Network are outlined below: Sustainable Fisheries Act 1996 The Marine Fish Conservation Network took part in a campaigning effort lasting four years to assist in the implementation of the Sustainable Fisheries Act 1996. The campaign was led to attempt to change regulations surrounding fishing, which had previously been defined by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act 1976 and is the original reason for the foundation of the organisation. As a result of this change, fishing regulations in the United States became focused around rehabilitating fish populations and conserving marine ecosystems, as opposed to the previous pro-exploitation agenda. Following the implementation of the Sustainable Fisheries Act, the Marine Fish Conservation Network also worked to block members of Congress from removing key policies from the act. They also produced a number of reports that found the act was not being sufficiently implemented and overfishing was still occurring, and ineffective plans had been implemented to allow for rehabilitation of marine ecosystems. Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act Amendment 2006 The Marine Fish Conservation Network also pushed for reforms to fishing legislation in 2006, which resulted in the amendment of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act 1976. The act included many of the recommendations made by the Network, such as the use of a quota system for allocating catch limits to commercial and recreational fishermen. Currently, the Network continues to be involved in campaigning for changes to this act to improve sustainability and management of the act. They have also opposed proposed the removal of restrictions within the bill made by members of Congress. Current Efforts Recreational Fishing Management Act 2017 The Marine Fish Conservation Network is currently pushing for another amendment to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act to encompass recreational fishing as well as commercial fishing. This change has been targeted by the group as they believe recreational fishing has a large impact on fisheries, because these fishermen tend to target high-value fish as opposed to large quantities of low value fish mostly targeted by commercial fisheries. This has so far resulted in the submission of an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute. The Network is still campaigning for this change, as well as for some changes to be made to the current amendment that has been proposed. The most notable is the ability for regional fishery management councils to implement further management measures beyond simple catch limits, such as regular studies of fisheries and the ability to set different annual catch limits if required.

The Reihengr√§ber culture (translated from German as Row grave culture) is an archaeological culture that refers to the burial practice of regularly arranged, identically orientated inhumation graves between the mid- fifth and early-eight century in central and western Europe. Existing within the Merovingian sphere of influence, the Reihengr√§ber culture was dominant in modern Belgium, northern France and the Rhineland, and developed from a blending of Gallic and Scandinavian cultures in the late-Roman to early- medieval period. Though the relevance of the Reihengr√§ber culture in outlining the complex ethnic, political and cultural context of 5th-7th century Europe has been questioned, similarities in material culture development within the Reihengr√§ber region outline the existence of Kerngebiet, or core areas of cultural unity and development, within Germanic territories during Merovingian rule. Geographical context River Rhine (Red), River Main (Blue) and River Danube (Yellow) The Reihengr√§ber culture, which developed within north- eastern Gaul under Romano-Germanic settlement during the fifth century, spread to the regions of Germanic regions of Thuringia and Bavaria in the sixth century. Scholars have divided the Reihengr√§ber culture into an eastern ‚ÄúThuringian and Langobard‚Äù zone and a western ‚ÄúBavarian and Alamanni‚Äù zone, based on the similar burial customs and material culture shared between these ethnic groups. Frankish populations were also present within these zones. Most Reihengr√§ber sites are found on the River Danube or the River Main, with pockets of Frankish dominated settlements on the River Rhine. The eastern zone of the Reihengr√§ber culture lies within the Thuringian Forest south of the Harz mountains, and extends eastward towards the River Elbe, where Slavic cultures with settled on the eastern bank. The western Bavarian zone however lies between the River Lech and River Enns. Both zones remained autonomous of Merovingian control until the mid-6th century, when Garibald I of Bavaria was installed as Duke in 555 A.D. The uniformity of the Reihengr√§ber culture‚Äôs burial practices is attributed to Clovis I, who unified the tribes of the Reihengr√§ber region into the early Merovingian dynasty. The unification of the Frankish dominated tribes into a single ‚Äòrow grave culture‚Äô was successful in simplifying burial customs from various forms of cremation or ritualised inhumation into this single practice. Burial practices The Reihengr√§ber culture features the burial practice of evenly spaced rows. In addition to the placement of funerary objects within the graves, the Reihengr√§ber culture is also known for the burial of horses, which while rare in the Bavarian zone, are common throughout burial sites in Gaul and Thuringia. The reopening of burial mounds and removal of grave goods shortly after burial is also a significant feature of Reihengr√§ber culture burial customs, and is linked culturally to Scandinavian practices associated with object animism. This practice is especially prevalent in the Frankish and Langobard areas of the ‚ÄòReihengr√§ber eastern zone‚Äô and peaks in practice in the early 7th century. This removal of burial objects, known as furta sacra, became especially common during the Carolingian dynasty during the 9th century, and was based on Harald Bluetooth's desecration of aristocratic burial mounds during his campaign in the Viken region. The usage of wetlands as predominant burial sites also runs parallels with Scandinavian practices. Material culture Fransica throwing axe on display in the Romano-Germanic Museum in Cologne, Germany The material culture of the Reihengr√§ber reveals distinctions between male and female burial practices. Male graves typically contain swords, axes and belts, whereas female graves largely contained brooches, necklaces and girdle hangers. Bronze conical helmets in the Reihengr√§ber culture are also prevalent, and are especially of note as they were offered as funerary objects within the late-iron age. Animistic designs occur extensively throughout Reihengr√§ber material culture, in particular bird-like iconography and shapes of Thuringian bow brooches. Late fifth century Thuringian graves in modern Scherzheim also contained sets of Zierschlusselpaare, or symbolic keys pairs, uncommon artefacts whose ritual significance is yet unknown. A Merovingian biconical pot from Rill, c. 620 CE Another common item is the biconical pot, (German: Knickwandtopf, Dutch: Knikwandpot, and French: Vase biconique), the most important type of ceramics from the Merovingian period. The name is derived from the shape of the vessel, the form looking like two cones on top of each other. Often, the outside of the pot is decorated with stamps, impressions or lines. The distribution of the pottery shows that these vases originate from different ceramic production sites. Biconical pots are also found in settlements.Wolfgang H√ºbener: Absatzgebiete fr√ºhgeschichtlicher T√∂pfereien n√∂rdlich der Alpen. Antiquitas Reihe 3 Bd. 6, Bonn 1969.  Interpretation   Social status  Disparities in funerary good quality and prevalence between Frankish and other ethnic groups‚Äô graves within the Reihengr√§ber culture also suggest a Frankish overclass who represented local leadership and nobility. The theory that Frankish rulers perceived the Germanic peoples of the Reihengr√§ber as laeti was suggested by Gregory of Tours in his Historia Francorum. Thuringian brooches give evidence to a cultural stratification between an elite and lower class, as they were developed on the commission of nobility and were almost exclusively found within he funerary sites of the entourages and personal attendants to these elites, who were mostly of Frankish descent. Despite clearly demarcated class differences between Frankish and Germanic peoples of the Reihengr√§ber culture, the lower class of both ethnic groups show few differences in burial practices, with the cemetery at Zeuzblen in Schweinfurt revealing burials of both groups side by side in the classic row-graves style. All graves showed burial gifts crafted in the Thuringian make, and reveal that many Frankish commoners integrated the material culture with native Germanic populations in the Reihengr√§ber region Property rights Baptism of Clovis I. Clovis unified and Christianized the Reihengr√§ber culture During the 1920s, archaeological investigation of the Reihengr√§ber culture led to the understanding the deposited funerary objects were seen as distinctly inalienable property that could not be inherited of sold. The Reihengr√§ber culture identified inalienable property as artefacts that could not be sold or exchanged due to their symbolic role as 'companion' objects to their original creators. These concepts are integral to the Reihengr√§ber culture‚Äôs unique burial customs, and were instrumental in establishing the Merovingian concept of male property rights over weaponry in a custom known as hergewaete. Female property rights over household and jewellery, known as gerade, have also been identified. Many of these inalienable property objects were found to have been removed from the graves as matching the Reihengr√§ber style. These concepts of inalienable property rights developed in the Reihengr√§ber region, contains similarities with the tenth century Germanic legal code of Sachsenspiegel, and influenced its creation. Following the Christianisation of Merovingian Gaul, and hence the Reihengr√§ber region, in the early 6th century, these property rights were transferred as Church property upon the owner‚Äôs death. Gold foil crosses also begin to appear in the archaeological record of the Reihengr√§ber culture from the late sixth to seventh century, appearing mostly around the French Alps and providing evidence for the Christianisation of the Reihengr√§ber region during this period. Ethnography The usefulness of the denomination of Frankish, Thuringian, Bavarian and other cultures as Reihengr√§ber culture is debated within the archaeological scholarship. It is clear that these ethnic groups shares similar burial practices, especially considering the increasing prevalence of Frankish arms in connecting the Reihengr√§ber region‚Äôs military culture. Particularly, the Francisca battle- axes, developed by Frankish warriors, have been located not just in the Merovingian heartland of Gaul, but also throughout the Reihengr√§ber region in Thuringia, Almannia and Bavaria. These serve as example of both the enforced unification of the Reihengr√§ber region under Clovis‚Äô early Merovingian dynasty, but also as evidence of the adoption of Frankish warcraft in uniting the ethnic groups of the Reihengr√§ber region. However, no single material culture unites the various communities pooled into the Reihengr√§ber culture, as Frankish, Gothic and Thuringian artefact forms exist among many local styles throughout the region. Social mobility within the Merovingian period influenced the sharing of local customs, eventuating in an amalgamation of burial practices that led to the eventually spaced inhumation graves and grave good deposits that dominated the region in the mid-6th century. Ethnic groups seem to have also moved throughout the Reihengr√§ber region constantly with permanent settlement largely matched by military control by dominant ethnic groups. The collapse of the Thuringian kingdoms between 531 and 534 resulted in large populations of Thuringian peoples emigrating from the region into Frankish territories in modern-France, leading to the introduction of Reihengr√§ber burial practices and material culture into western Europe, though they remained a subordinate class to the Frankish overclass.

In 1844, Edward Kissam undertook the first ever recorded attempt of a xenograft on a human; the donor was a pig and was ultimately unsuccessful. Henry Power made a suggestion in 1867 that using human tissue rather than animal tissue for transplantation would be more effective however, it would not be until 1905 for the first successful human corneal transplant by MD, Eduard Zirm. Since 1905, various techniques and procedures have been developed to increase the effect of the transplantation and success rate. Traditionally, the most common procedure for corneal transplantation was penetrating keratoplasty whereby an entire corneal button is replaced. Recently however, procedures such as anterior and posterior lamellar techniques where only diseased or damaged layers of the cornea are selectively replaced have become increasingly popular.  Procedure  After the death of the donor, the cornea must be retrieved within a few hours and will be screened for diseases and assessed for its viability to be used for a corneal transplantation by assessing its health. If passed, the cornea will be stored in a nutrient solution at an eye bank until needed for an operation. In most cases, the corneal button is removed from the donor cornea prior to storage as this extends its possible storage time. For the operation procedure, the patient is anaesthetised and the damaged or diseased corneal button will be removed using a bladed instrument called a trephine (approximately 8.0‚Äì8.5mm in diameter).Wachler, B. S. B. (2017). Cornea Transplants: What to Expect. Retrieved from https://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/cornea-transplant.htm A corneal button of matching size is then put in place of the removed tissue and stitched in place. Usually, twelve clock-hour nylon stitches are used with a continuous band nylon stitch. The procedure takes approximately 60‚Äì90 minutes however, a few months will be required for vision to return to what it was like preceding the operation; and continue to improve from then on. Approximately 12‚Äì18 months after the operation, all stitches will be removed. During this time, anti-rejection drops will be needed to minimise inflammation; the dosage of which is carefully monitored by a corneal surgeon. Due to the swelling, it is impossible to predict the quality of vision without removing the stitches. A few months after the stitches are removed, measurements are made of the shape of the cornea and refractive error. If the shape of the cornea is fairly regular and refractive error is similar to that of the other eye, it is usually possible to fix any error with glasses; if not, a hard lens may be necessary to correct vision.  Corneal graft rejection  One of the largest causes for issue in penetrating keratoplasty is the natural immune rejection of a transplanted corneal button which can cause reversible or irreversible damage to the grafted cornea. The types corneal rejection include epithelial rejection, chronic rejection, hyperacute rejection and endothelial rejection and these can occur individually, or in some cases in conjunction.Panda, A., Vanathi, M., Kumar, A., Dash, Y., & Priya, S. (2007). Corneal graft rejection. Survey of Ophthalmology, 52(4), 375‚Äì396. There are however, two main preventative methods to reduce the possibility of immune rejection; prevention and management. Prevention involves increasing compatibility of the donor tissue with that of the patient and suppressing host immune response. These analyses of donor corneas are done during a screening phase soon after receiving the donation. The management aspect mainly involves early detection and therapy with corticosteroids along with Immunosuppressive therapy.  Corneal button storage  There are two main storage methods used in the storage of the corneal button. They are stored using a hypothermic storage method or an organ culture method in a tissue culture medium. Corneal buttons cannot be reliably frozen as a storage method. Usually, the corneal button is removed from the entire globe before storage as this extends the possible storage time. The hypothermic storage method was first introduced in 1974McCarey, B. E., Kaufman, H. E. (1974). Improved Corneal Storage. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci, 13(3), 165‚Äì173. Retrieved from https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2158398 and it requires no complex equipment. It is stored in a refrigerator, usually 2‚Äì6 ¬∞C, in commercially available storage solutions. Factors such as the temperature, maximal storage time, expiry date, etc. should be maintained according to the storage solution manufacturer‚Äôs recommendations and can vary depending on the solution. Also, provided donor screening permits are available, the corneal tissue can be used immediately after leaving storage for surgery. Inspection of tissue can however be performed in a closed system under a slit lamp or secular microscope. The organ culture method, first introduced in 1976,Doughman, D. J., Harris, J. E., & Schmitt, M. K. (1976). Penetrating keratoplasty using 37 C organ cultured cornea. Transactions of the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, 81(5), 778‚Äì793. . Retrieved from www.scopus.com is however quite complicated. The corneal button is stored in an incubator approximately 30‚Äì37 ¬∞C in a tissue culture medium into which either fetal or new-born calf serum, antibiotics and antimycotics are added. The corneal cells are also injected with dehydrating macromolecules to maintain hydration, this causes the corneal button to swell to approximately twice its original thickness during storage. During storage, the medium must be replaced within every 10‚Äì14 days. When it is required for surgery, the swollen tissue is placed in a dextrin containing storage medium which brings down the swelling and must also be inspected under strict aseptic conditions.  Donor selection  There is a rigorous criteria for donor selection as it is essential to minimise possibility of disease transmission. This criteria focuses on medial medical records and post-mortem serological tests which aim not to eliminate risk, but to limit risk to a reasonable level. A balance between safety and availability.J√∫lio, S., & Barretto, S. (2017). Eye bank procedures: donor selection criteria. Arq Bras Oftalmol, 81(1), 73‚Äì79. A health history report is usually used however, death certificate reports and data from family and acquaintances are also acceptable substitutions. The donation is rejected if no information can be found. Donations can be rejected or limited if some specific diseases are found in a donor's medical history. Diseases transmissible via corneal transplantation include bacterial infection and fungal infection,Gandhi, S. S., Lamberts, D. W., & Perry, H. D. (1981).

Life  Scumeck Sabottka is the eldest child (of three children) of the merchant Hans Georg Sabottka and his wife Adelheid (n√©e Kuntze). At the age of 18, Sabottka moved to West Berlin and joined the punk scene there. In his home town, he was already a guitarist for the Dortmund punk rock group 'Public Enemy'. He got to know the musicians FM Einheit from the Hamburg group Abw√§rts and in 1982 he worked as the band‚Äôs driver. Later he became tour manager of the group Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, and he accompanied them internationally until 1984. Also in 1982, he organized his first concert at the SO 36 Club in Berlin with the Australian noise electric group, ‚ÄòSPK‚Äô. In August 1984, together with the head of the company ‚ÄòRough Trade Booking‚Äô Dietrich Eggert and the manager of the band Die Toten Hosen, Jochen H√ºlder, he founded the company ‚ÄòMCT, Music Consulting Team GmbH‚Äô, in Herne. The company‚Äôs first tours were for the punk band Ramones from New York, the British punk combo King Kurt and the Welsh avantgarde musician John Cale. Parallel to this, Sabottka worked as an international tour manager for Violent Femmes and Johnathan Richman. After the departure of Eggert and H√ºlder, Sabottka took over the company MCT in 1988 with the D√ºsseldorf concert organizers Bernhard Lewkowicz and Rene Heinersdorff jr. In 1994 Sabottka moved to Munich with MCT, split from Lewkowicz and Heinersdorff Jr. and joined up with the famous concert organizers Marcel Avram and Fritz Rau, who took over the majority of the company shares. During this time (from 1994-1999) Sabottka organized concerts for artists such as: R.E.M, Lenny Kravitz, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Cramps, Celine Dion, Tom Waits, Tanita Tikaram, Marilyn Manson, Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow, Velvet Underground, Patti Smith, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Kraftwerk, Robbie Williams, Nick Cave and many more. In 1998, Sabottka bought back all Avram & Rau's shares and moved to Berlin again. From 1991 to 2018, Sabottka was responsible for the worldwide coordination of the live performances of the electronic pioneers Kraftwerk. Since 1991 Sabottka has been responsible for the worldwide coordination of the live performances of the German rock band Rammstein. This was followed by stadium tours with Robbie Williams, which sold about 1.2 million tickets in 2006. In 2005, Sabottka founded the internet concert ticket sales portal 'Tickets.de' (which he sold in 2010). For the first time in 2010, 150,000 personalized concert tickets were sold worldwide for the band Take That‚Äôs stadium tour. This was followed by the heated battle against the secondary sale of concert tickets at inflated prices. In 2017, the documentary ‚ÄúDer Konzertdealer‚Äù by filmmaker Sobo Swobodnik about Scumeck Sabottka, which depicted the harsh, globalized business behind the tours in the backstage area of the concert industry, was released in German cinemas. The film music is by British experimentalist and artist Dinos Chapman.

AirQ+ has been used in the BreatheLife campaign and in numerous studies aimed at measuring long-term exposure to ambient particulate matter PM2.5. The first version of the program, AirQ, was distributed in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program in 1999, followed by another version of AirQ for Windows in 2000. A substantial difference between AirQ and AirQ+ is that AirQ+ contains a new graphical user interface with several help texts and various features to input and analyse data and illustrate results. AirQ+ version 1.3 was released in October 2018 and version 2.0 in November 2019, and is available in English, Russian and French languages.  Purpose  AirQ+ is intended as a tool to ascertain the magnitude of the burden and impacts of air population on health in a given locality. It performs this function by featuring data analysis, graphing tools, tables and quantitative information for prominent pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and tropospheric ozone (O3). AirQ+ also has the capacity to perform calculations for black carbon (BC) and provides rough estimates of impacts of household (indoor) air pollution on health. AirQ+ can be applied to long- and short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and to long-term household air pollution exposure caused by solid fuel use.  Data input  For most prominent air pollutants, the user needs to input the following data: * air quality data (concentration of air pollutants); * relative risk (RR) values for the pollutant being assessed (source: epidemiological studies; default values are provided) * data for population at risk (population distribution); * health data (the health effect in question, like mortality); * a concentration cut-off value for consideration.

She published Skye: the Island and Its Legends in 1952, a collection of fireside stories she had heard from her mother and her grandmother at Orbost House, in the Isle of Skye, Scotland. Her work was drawn from and referenced by many writers, from specialists to popular authors, such as Neil Gaiman, who exploited these stories in their work.  Early life  Swire was the daughter of Flora Robertson, from the Robertson family of Orbost House on Loch Bracadale, and William Woodthorpe Tarn, a barrister turned historian from London. On 9 December 1931, Otta Tarn married her cousin Colonel Roger Swire in Inverness. Otta Swire was involved in organizing the Skye Gathering, which had been started by Landowners \\"egged on by Lady MacDonald of Sleat\\" in 1878. In 1945 Otta Swire and her husband purchased Orbost House, where her parents had previously resided, but which had become a home for alcoholics in 1890 and,a shooting lodge and hotel in the 1930s.  Literary and academic approach  Without an active link to a University, and in a time when Folklore Studies were still emerging as an academic discipline, Swire's first book was published by Oxford University Press. Her literary contribution is an example of the translation of oral traditions into public texts. The Skye stories are drawn from Gaelic and Norse traditions, as told by a generation that predated the World Wars.

Originally it was used as a shelter for beggars and travelers without resources. The gate is built in the Mud√©jar style, providing a strong and solid appearance, with the lower part having rusticated ashlar. It has a characteristic horseshoe arch that opens to the neighbourhood of San Marcos. The passage within the arch contains a deteriorated statue of the Virgin of the Way. The Puerta de Santiago is the best preserved gate in the walls of Segovia. In its current construction, successive interventions can be seen, with the west fa√ßade dating back to the 13th century and the east fa√ßade with granite ashlar blocks and the remains of a decorative frame dating back to the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

She acquired a public reputation as the author of a standard work on Dutch jewelry and as a jewelry collector.  Life and work   Early life and education  Marianne de Boer was born into an entrepreneurial family, as she likes to remind people exactly nine months after the liberation. She was born and grew up at Bussum, a small town located between Amsterdam and Utrecht, and close to the (subsequently reclaimed) southern part of the Zuiderzee. Marianne was one of three children in the family: her father was a contractor for the hydraulic engineering sector. At school she excelled in Mathematics. She studied Industrial Design at the Arts and Crafts Academy (\\"Kunstrijverheidschool\\", but subsequently renamed) in Amsterdam between 1964 and 1967, but never completed her course. It was here that she met the artist-designer Gerard Unger whom she married in 1968. At the academy she suffered terribly from headaches which were diagnosed provisionally as \\"migraine-related\\". The academy was housed in a brand new building with modern plastic ceilings, carpet block flooring and a permanent smell of \\"paint\\" in the air. Ten years later it would be determined that the headaches were part of an allergic reaction to the chemical gases given off by the exotic materials used in the interior construction of the modern academy building. Marjan Unger's drive to find out everything about art remained undimmed, and after the birth of Flora, the couple's daughter, she again became a student, studying art history at the University of Amsterdam between 1974 and 1987. She combined this with a teaching job at the Amsterdam Fashion Academy of which she became a director in 1973 and where, according to her husband she brought about a change of culture by attracting guest-lecturers from industry. Unger left the Amsterdam academy in 1977, but teaching was a recurring theme throughout her career. She later taught both at the Rotterdam Art Academy and, between 1982 and 2006, at the Rietveld Academie.  Early career  A compulsive communicator, between 1980 and 1989 Unger was editor in chief of \\"Bijvoorbeeld\\", a magazine focusing on creative and applied arts which according to one admirer she \\"transformed from a rather dusty magazine into a lively and critical [post-modern avant-gardist] periodical\\". In 1995 she took a position at Amsterdam's \\"Sandberg Institute\\", teaching a post graduate course on what she termed \\"Vrije vormgeving\\" (loosely, \\"free design\\") which placed her at the heart of a rapidly shifting three-way interface between art, design and commerce. It was around 1995 that Marjan Unger's passion for jewelry came to the fore. She launched herself on more than a decade of intensive research. She also began to build up a jewelry collection of her own, many of her purchases consciously supporting younger innovative designers working outside the mainstream jewelry industry. She did not hesitate, on occasion, to wear one of her more unconventional pieces, giving rise to \\"how do you dare wear that?\\" reactions. In 2002 Unger organised the \\"Zonder wrijving geen glans\\" (loosely, \\"no shine without friction\\") jewelry exhibition at the Utrecht Art Museum (\\"Centraal Museum\\"), which provided a showcase for her findings on the - till now little researched or chronicled - Dutch jewelry industry during the first two thirds of the twentieth century. Her first book appeared two years later. \\"Het Nederlandse sieraad in de 20ste eeuw\\", published in 2004, dealt with the Dutch jewelry business during the twentieth century, thereby filling a perceived gap in the academic literature.Unger, Marjan (2004) Het Nederlandse sieraad in de 20ste eeuw. Bussum: THOTH. It might be described (and has been) as a \\"bulky standard work\\" (\\"...het lijvige standaardwerk van haar hand\\"). She also agreed to produce a new arts magazine aimed at arts students. Roughly 20,000 copies appeared twice yearly between 2004 and 2008 under the title \\"Morf\\", and provided a mixture of old and new texts giving wider context for Unger's lectures, and those of colleagues.  Later career  Continuing with her researches led to the award of her doctorate from Leiden University on 17 March 2010. Her dissertation was entitled \\"Sieraad in context, een multidisciplinair kader voor de beschouwing van het sieraad\\" (loosely, \\"Jewelry in context: a multi-disciplinary framework for evaluating jewels\\"). At the same time as she was completing her doctoral dissertation Marjan Unger and her husband made a substantial donation of 492 pieces of jewelry from her collection to the Dutch National Museum (\\"Rijksmuseum\\") in Amsterdam. The pieces donated included items she had commissioned from known designers but also many pieces produced by unknown artists from outside the jewelry mainstream. Alongside the jewelry collection, items donated also included a large collection of ABBA button-badges and some coin-based jewelry. Personal tragedy struck in 2012 when the Ungers' only child was killed by cancer. Gerard Unger had by now established himself internationally as a typeface designer as a result of which Flora Unger-Weisfelt is celebrated by an unusual memorial. An \\"upright sans italic\\" font was named after her in 1984. Marjan Unger's second book, \\"Jewellery Matters\\", was written jointly with the Rijksmuseum curator Suzanne van Leeuwen and was published in 2017. In 2017 Unger handed over another 200 pieces, described by sources as \\"the rest of her collection\\", to the Rijksmuseum. She told an interviewer that this had always been her intention, but the discovery of her incurable metastatic bone cancer had hastened the action.

The line is owned by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), long-distance services are operated by the SBB and regional services are operated by the BLS.  History  Bern State Railways  The first section between Bern Wylerfeld and Zollikofen was opened by the Swiss Central Railway (Schweizerische Centralbahn, SCB) on 16 June 1857, when it began operating its line to Olten. A little less than a year later, it was extended to today's Bern station. The extension to Biel/Bienne via Lyss was opened to traffic just under seven years after the opening of the line to Zollikofen. This line was built by the Bern State Railways (Bernische Staatsbahn). The section was part of the Bern State Railway, which ran from La Neuveville via Biel/Bienne and Bern to Langnau. This opening was accompanied by changes to the stations at both Bern and Biel, but also by the duplication of the SCB line from Zollikofen to Bern. In 1884, the Bern State Railway was absorbed into the Jura-Bern-Luzern Railway (Jura-Bern-Luzern-Bahn), which in turn was merged with the Western Switzerland‚ÄìSimplon Company (Compagnie de la Suisse Occidentale et du Simplon, SOS) to form the Jura-Simplon Railway (Jura- Simplon-Bahn, JS) in 1890/91. When the JS merged with the SCB, Swiss Northeastern Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn, NOB) and the United Swiss Railways (Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen, VSB) to from the Swiss Federal Railways in 1902, the line between Biel and Bern was owned by a single company for the first time.  Development and electrification  The line was electrified in three stages, with the section between Bern and Wylerfeld being electrified in 1919. The SBB electrification of the line to Thun in 1927 meant that the line to Zollikofen was also electrified. The remainder to Biel was electrified before 1928. Duplication of the tracks took place in several stages from 1859 to 1996. Before the takeover by the SBB, only the Bern‚ÄìZollikofen and the Busswil‚ÄìLyss sections (which formed part of the Lausanne‚ÄìPayerne‚ÄìLyss‚ÄìSolothurn railway) had been duplicated. The Zollikofen‚ÄìM√ºnchenbuchsee section was duplicated in 1933 and the remaining gaps were duplicated from 1962. The last two-track section between Sch√ºpfen and Suberg-Grossaffoltern was opened on 19 August 1996. A station opened in Studen at the end of May 1999.  Third track Zollikofen-R√ºtti  A groundbreaking ceremony was carried out for the construction of a third track between Zollikofen and the area of R√ºtti in 2009. Previously, the two double tracks from Biel and Olten merged in Zollikofen into one set of double tracks continuing to R√ºti, where three tracks run to Bern. Closing this bottleneck allowed, on the one hand, the increase of services on the Biel line, and on the other hand, the improvement of access for trains from Thun, so that all RegioExpress trains from Brig and Zweisimmen could run to Bern. In this context, all tracks from Bern are connected to the line to Thun. At the timetable change in December 2011, the BLS upgraded its S-Bahn service between Bern and M√ºnchenbuchsee to run every quarter of an hour as a result of the opening of the third track between Zollikofen and R√ºtti. At the same time, the SBB abolished the RegioExpress stop in M√ºnchenbuchsee.  Rail services  RegioExpress  On the Biel‚ÄìBern line RegioExpress services run every half hour and are mainly operated with Stadler KISS sets or IC2000 double-deck sets hauled by Re 460 locomotives. The journey takes 25 minutes with a stop in Lyss. The RegioExpress is operated by the SBB; one train an hour is operated by SBB on a commercial basis, while the other one is subsidised by the canton. In the past, the trains were operated as InterRegio services, but have been reclassified as RegioExpress services because the running time is less than an hour.  Regional services The Bern S-Bahn line S3 services, which also run every half hour, last ten minutes longer (35 minutes) and run from Biel to Bern and on through the G√ºrbe Valley to Belp. At peak times, S31 services from Belp to M√ºnchenbuchsee are extended to Biel with stops in Sch√ºpfen and Lyss. The S-Bahn services are operated by BLS.

A few days later the imperialist forces were defeated by republicans under Gregorio Jos√© Ram√≠rez in the Battle of Ochomogo. Family Joaqu√≠n Mariano de Oreamuno y Mu√±oz de la Trinidad was born on 14 July 1755 in the town of Cartago, Costa Rica. His paternal family was of noble Basque origin, and included a knight of the Order of Santiago. Two brothers, Francisco Xavier Oriamuno and Jos√© Antonio de Oriamuno, had been born in Panama and came to Costa Rica in the 1720s, where they changed their name to Oreamuno. Their children were among the leading nobles of the country. His parents were Jos√© Antonio de Oreamuno y Garc√≠a de Estrada and Mar√≠a Encarnaci√≥n Mu√±oz de la Trinidad. His mother's family, the Mu√±oz de la Trinidad, were of an equally noble family from Seville. They belonged to a small group of patricians that controlled the province at this time. Early years Joaqu√≠n Mariano was baptized on 15 July 1755 in the parish of Santiago. His godparents were his paternal grandfather Francisco Xavier de Oreamuno y V√°squez-Mel√©ndez, a former lieutenant governor of the province, and Mar√≠a de Arburola y Hoces-Navarro, sister of his maternal grandmother. A year after Joaqu√≠n Mariano was born his great uncle Jos√© Antonio de Oreamuno y V√°squez-Mel√©ndez was appointed acting governor of the province. The local school provided only a basic education, but Oreamuno gained hands-on experience in managing the family livestock farm and negotiating with dealers and officials. He taught himself the elements of law and medicine from his father's library, developed a taste for literature and even wrote some poetry and plays. As a hidalgo he was naturally an officer in the local militia. In January 1782 he was elected Mayordomo de Propios(es), an unpaid position in which he was responsible for managing the assets and income of the city council. Oreamuno married Florencia Pia Josefa Jim√©nez y Rodr√≠guez de Robledo. She was from a wealthy patrician family. The marriage took place on 11 November 1782 in the parish of Santiago. They would have nine children, several of whom died in infantry. On 27 March 1787 Oreamuno was appointed notary public of the vicariate of Cartago by Juan F√©lix de Villegas, Bishop of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. In July 1788 Don Joaquin acquired a large cattle ranch near the Rio Grande on the road to the Pacific, and over the years that followed Don Joaquin became owner of a large herd of cattle and horses, and was active in trading cattle and hides. He also served in the local militia, where he became a lieutenant, and continued as notary of the vicariate. King Charles III of Spain died in December 1788. Governor Peri√© became seriously ill and appointed Joaquin's father as interim governor of Costa Rica. Peri√© died on 7 January 1789 and Don Jos√© Antonio continued as governor. In 1789 Oreamuno became involved in dispute over boundaries with his neighbor, and at one point knocked his opponent to the ground in exchange for an insult. This led to a trial in which Oreamuno was acquitted, then a survey of the properties, and then a lengthy process of claims and counterclaims. Governor V√°zquez sided with Oreamuno, and the eventual settlement was in his favour. The French Revolution broke out in 1789, and in January 1793 King Louis XVI of France was guillotined. A war began between France and Spain that would lead to the Bourbons of Spain being deposed. The conflict had little effect on the sleepy rural economy of Costa Rica. Don Joaquin turned 38 in July 1793. He was a respected figure in Cartago with a successful livestock business and a reputation as an amateur lawyer in a country where there were no professionals. Constitutional disputes On 15 February 1814 Oreamuno was elected deputy for Cartago. The other deputies were Evaristo Guti√©rrez (Nicoya), Manuel Alvarado Alvarado (Valle Hermosa: San Jos√©), Pedro Antonio Solares (Heredia and Alajuela) and Jos√© Francisco Garcia (Ujarr√°s, Oros√≠ and Tucurrique). All of these men were prominent and wealthy inhabitants of Costa Rica. The deputies did not take office, because the Cortes were dissolved in 1814 and the provincial councils abolished when the Spanish Constitution of 1812 was abolished by King Ferdinand VII of Spain. During December 1821 and the first two weeks of January 1822 Costa Rica began to comply with the stipulations of the Covenant of Concord, which would form a government while the situation with the Mexican Empire was being clarified. The Interim Council was elected on 1 December 1821. The Electoral Council reformed the Covenant on 10 January 1822 to allow annexation of the province to Mexico, and two imperial deputies were elected, Jos√© Francisco de Peralta and Jos√© Antonio Alvarado, both prominent men from Cartago who lived in Guatemala. San Jose did not threaten armed opposition to the annexation, but both that town and Alajuela were very critical of annexation and concerned about the constitutional implications. Finally the Electoral Council elected the members of the Superior Governing Council that would govern Costa Rica from 13 January to 31 December 1822. Oreamuno was a member of the Interim Council and the Electoral Council. He was not a member of the Superior Governing Council. In May 1822 Agust√≠n de Iturbide proclaimed himself Emperor of Mexico, with plans to extend his rule to all of Central America. The agrarian and aristocratic landowners of Cartago and Heredia wanted to maintain the privileges they had held under the former Spanish empire. They thought these would be protected under the new Mexican Empire. The liberal merchants of San Jos√© and Alajuela wanted to introduce a republican government. The leaders of the four towns of the Central Valley met and agreed to remain neutral until the situation became clearer. A new Governing Council was elected in Cartago on 24 December 1822 and took office on 1 January 1823, with Jos√© Santos Lombardo Alvarado as president. The council was to have ruled throughout 1823 during the constitutional process for annexation to Mexico. However, the crisis in Mexican politics affected all of Central America, and the council lasted only until 14 March 1823. In February the discussions between annexationists and non-annexationists became extremely heated, and the council ordered open meetings in all the towns to draw up three lists by 2 March: those in favour of the empire, the republicans and those who wanted some other option. By March 1823 the Superior Governing Council of Costa Rica had still not declared allegiance to the emperor, and the conservatives decided to stage a coup. Attempted coup On 29 March 1823 a group of Cartago residents led by Oreamuno occupied the army barracks and proclaimed that Costa Rica would join the Mexican Empire. Oreamuno said the formal ceremony of allegiance to the empire would take effect on 6 April. The Republican leader Gregorio Jos√© Ram√≠rez sent an ultimatum to the imperialists on 4 April 1823. The two armies met in the morning of 5 April at Ochomogo, near Cartago. Oreamuno remained at home resting in Cartago for the first few hours. There was an attempt to negotiate, but that quickly broke down and both sides began firing their muskets from the cover of the large volcanic rocks that litter the area. The combat was prolonged, but in the end the forces of Cartago were completely defeated. Oreamuno died in Cartago on 13 November 1827 at the age of 72.

After the war the literary Reina Prinsen Geerligs Award was created in her memory. Biography Reina Prinsen Geerligs was born in 1922 in Semarang, Dutch East Indies, the daughter of the chemist Johan Prinsen Geerligs and his wife Helen Carolina Zon. She had a brother who was two years younger. They moved to Amsterdam when she was still very young. In the Netherlands, Prinsen Geerligs was a member of the Youth Organisation for the Study of Nature, and she started writing poetry and prose. But when the war started, she mostly stopped writing and concentrated on her work with the resistance, initially mainly as a courier. Her house became the meeting place for resistance group CS-6, and Reina Prinsen Geerligs became involved with at least two assassination attempts. In 1943 she and Louis Boissevain tried to kill police officer Pieter Kaay, but stopped the attempt when they saw Kaay seated with a child in his lap. Another group executed him the next day. Prinsen Geerligs was arrested on 23 July 1943, and confessed to her work as a resistance fighter. In November 1943 she and some other members of the resistance group were transported to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where they were executed the next day. Her parents only learned of her death in 1946. With the money they had set apart to finance her studies, they created a fund for a literary award in her honour, the Reina Prinsen Geerligs Award, given to a young writer between the ages of 20 and 25, and which was won by some of the most prominent Dutch writers at the start of their career, including Gerard Reve and Harry Mulisch.

The location of the battle is disputed, but most likely near modern Langa de Duero, as Sallust informs us the battle was fought on the banks of the river Duoro.Sallust, History, 2.98; Spann, Saguntum vs Segontia, Historia, 33 (1984). The battle lasted from noon till night and ended in a draw. Background In 88 BC Lucius Cornelius Sulla marched his legions on Rome starting a civil war. Quintus Sertorius, a client of Gaius Marius, joined his patron's faction and took up the sword against the Sullan faction (mainly optimates). After the death of Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gaius Marius, Sertorius lost faith with his factions leadership. In 82 BC, during the second war against Sulla, he left Italy for his assigned propraetorian province in Hispania.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius , 6. Unfortunately his faction lost the war in Italy right after his departure and in 81 BC Sulla sent Gaius Annius Luscus with several legions to take the Spanish provinces from Sertorius.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 7. After a brief resistance Sertorius and his men are expelled form Hispania. They end up in Mauretania in north- western Africa where they conquered the city of Tingis. Here the Lusitanians, a fierce Iberian tribe who were about to be invaded by a Sullan governor, approached him. They asked him to become their war leader in the fight against the Sullans. In 80 BC Sertorius landed at the little fishing town of Baelo near the Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar) and returned to Hispania. Soon after his landing he fought and defeated the Sullan general Fufidius (the aforementioned Sullan governor) at the Baetis river. After this he defeated several Sullan armies and drove his opponents from Spain. Threatened by Sertorius' successes, the Senate in Rome upgraded Hispania Ulterior to a proconsular province and sent the proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius with a large army to fight him.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.68. Sertorius used guerrilla tactics so effectively he wore down Metellus to the point of exhaustion while Sertorius' legate Lucius Hirtuleius defeated the governor of Hispania Citerior, Marcus Domitius Calvinus. In 76 BC the government in Rome decided to send Pompey and an even larger army to help Metellus.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 17. In the same year Sertorius was joined by Marcus Perpenna, who brought with him the remnants of the army of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, the rebel consul of 78 BC.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 15. Thus reinforced, Sertorius decided to try and take the Spanish east coast (because the cities there supported his enemies). His first target was the city of Lauron where he outgeneraled Pompey and massacred a large part of his army (see: the battle of Lauron).Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 18; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18; Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.31; John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp.226-227; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.96-101. In 75 BC Sertorius decided to take on Metellus and leave the battered Pompey to his legates Perpenna and Herennius. Pompey defeated his opponents in a battle near ValentiaPlutarch, Life of Pompey, 18. forcing Sertorius to come and take charge of the situation. Metellus used the change in command to defeat Hirtuleius, left in charge of the Sertorian western army, at the Battle of Italica and marched after Sertorius.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 19. Pompey and Sertorius, not wanting to wait for Metellus, met at the Battle of Sucro, which ended in a draw.Appian, Civil Wars, 1.110; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 19; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18. Sertorius had to give up his conquest of the Spanish east coast and withdrew inland. Metellus and Pompey followed him to \\"Saguntum\\" (probably not Saguntum on the coast, for he had withdrawn inland, but one of the many Segontias in Celtiberia). Prelude After the disastrous battles of Valentia and Italica and the draw and retreat from the Battle of Sucro, Sertorius had to raise the morale of his troops. In this he succeeded by using the White Fawn.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 20 Sertorius owned a white fawn which, at least this is what he told his people, gave him messages from the goddess Diana. With his forces morale raised he awaited the Roman armies while launching many guerilla raids to weaken them during their advance. The Romans were hard pressed for supplies and Metellus decided to march on the Celtiberian town of Segontia to feed his army on their stores. Sertorius's Celtiberian troops refused to let one of their towns fall into Roman hands and fighting ensued.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 124-126 The battle Plutarch remarks that this battle was forced upon Sertorius (probably by his Iberian and/or Celt-Iberian troops).Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 21. The fighting started at noon and lasted well into the night. Sertorius first fought Pompey while his legates Perpenna and Hirtuleius fought Metellus. After Hirtuleius had fallen Sertorius switched places with Perpenna and launched several personally-led ad hominem attacks on Metellus intended on taking him out of the fight. Metellus stood his ground and in the course of the fight he was wounded by a spear. This turned out to be a turning point in the battle for Metellus' men counter- attacked in revenge and pushed back the Iberians. ::All the Romans who saw or heard of this [Metellus being wounded] were filled with shame at the idea of deserting their commander. The same event filled them with fury against the enemy. So, they covered Metellus with their shields and carried him out of danger. Then they fell energetically on the Iberians and pushed them back. Victory changed sides. Metellus then complacently decided to rest his troops and made camp. Sertorius in the meantime had regrouped his men and in the evening launched an unexpected attack on Metellus' camp, and attempted to exploit its vulnerable position by cutting it off with a trench. Unfortunately for the Sertorians, Pompey and his army now showed up and forced them to withdraw. Over the course of the battle Pompey had lost 6,000 men while Sertorius had lost only 3,000, but to offset this Perperna had lost some 5,000 soldiers. Metellus's losses are unknown, but must have been significant as well. Sertorius' second-in-command, Lucius Hirtuleius, and Pompey's brother- in-law, Gaius Memmius (married to Pompey's sister), were among the casualties. Aftermath This was the last pitched battle Sertorius fought, and probably one he had not wanted in the first place. Sertorius ordered his army to break up and reassemble at a place he designated.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.13.3. He then made for the fortress town of Clunia and prepared for a siege.Livy, Epitome, 92. Even while fortifying Clunia Sertorius was dispatching messengers to his allies, requesting them to raise new levies. The war was far from over, Sertorius still had allies, his reputation and an army. After the Siege of Clunia he reverted to guerilla warfare and the war would drag on for another three years and only end because a few of his own men plotted against Sertorius and assassinated him.

It connects the Kashmir Valley to the Rajouri and Poonch districts via the 'Mughal Road'. It is the highest point on the Mughal road at and lies to the south west of the Kashmir valley.  Name  The Pir Panjal Pass appears in Srivara's Rajatarangini as Panchaladeva (IAST: PƒÅ√±cƒÅladeva), meaning the deity of Panchala. Panchala is a country mentioned in the Mahabharata in the northwest Uttar Pradesh. However, there are also traditions that place the Mahabharata regions in western Punjab and southern Kashmir. Scholar Dineshchandra Sircar has analysed the geography described in the Shakti‚Äêsangama Tantra, where this is indeed the case. Scholar M. A. Stein states that the high mountain passes were always regarded as deities or were associated with deities. These customs continued after the region was Islamised by substituting the concept of Pir, Muslim saint, for deity. The Pir Panjal Pass gave its name to the entire mountain range (Pir Panjal Range). In recent times, the term \\"Panjal\\" has become restricted to the mountain range, and the pass came to be called simply Peer Ki Gali (the Pir's pass). It is associated with the saint Nund Rishi as well as another saint Sheikh Ahmed Karim.  Description  The Pir Panjal Pass can be taken to run between its western entrance, which goes by the name Peer Ki Gali, and a historical way station called Aliabad Sarai at its eastern end. A stream referred to as Pir Panjal stream runs through the valley, flowing east, which becomes the Rambi Ara River in the Shopian district. Scholar Mohibbul Hassan states that the old route through the pass kept to the southern side of the stream, but the Moghuls switched it to the northern side because a steep cliff called Hastivanj to the south was difficult to cross. The modern \\"Mughal Road\\" constructed between 2005‚Äì2009, keeps close to the route used by the Mughals, though it is not identical to it. To the west of Peer Ki Gali, cliffs descend steeply into a valley, which carries another mountain stream that joins the Poonch River flowing from the north. A hill village called Bahramgala (original name: Bhairavgala) marks the end of the valley. The Sikh sources name the pass itself as Bahramgala pass, in effect marking Bahramgala as is western end. The modern Mughal Road avoids the steep descent by following the hill sides to the north. It ends at a town called Bufliaz about 10 km to the west of Bahramgala. From there the National Highway 144A connects to Poonch to the northwest and Rajouri to the south. At Peer Ki Gali, the temperature often drops as low as -7 ¬∞C or -9 ¬∞C in winter. It is the highest point on Mughal Road. Peer Ki Gali is 40 km away from Shopian, 80 km from Poonch..  History and significance  Historian Mohibbul Hasan states that the Pir Panjal Pass was one of the main passes into the Kashmir Valley and exercised a great influence on its history. A route linking Hirapur (modern Hirpora) in the Kashmir Valley with Rajauri via the pass is known to have been use from ancient times. During the period of the sultans it seems to have been extended up to Bhimber. After conquering the Kashmir Valley, the emperor Akbar strengthened the route into an 'Imperial Road' stretching from Lahore to Kashmir. In modern times, the route has been referred to as the 'Mughal Road'.Now, Mughal Road To Connect J&K;, The Times of India, 14 July 2005. The Sikh emperor, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, launched an invasion of the Durrani- controlled Kashmir Valley in 1814, partly via the Pir Panjal Pass. He divided the forces into two parts, one attacking via the Pir Panjal Pass under the command of Dewan Ram Dayal and the other led by himself via the Tosa Maidan. Ram Dayal forced through the Pir Panjal pass, reached Baramulla and fortified himself. However, Ranjit Singh could not break through the Durrani defences at Tosa Madian, and was forced to retreat. In a second invasion in 1819, all the forces were sent via the Tosa Maidan, and conquered the Durrani forces. Aliabad Sarai Aliabad Sarai way station seen from behind from the current Mughal Road The Aliabad Sarai is a historical rest house in the Pir Panjal Pass, said to have been constructed by the Emperor Jahangir towards the end of the 16th century. It was one of the 14 halting stations constructed between Lahore and Srinagar along the Moghal Road. An Iranian engineer called Ali Mardan Khan was in charge of the construction, aided by the local chieftains. The safe keeping of the heritage building has been neglected by the government, and it has been used in recent times by local shepherds as a shed for cattle.Tazeem Akhter, A Peek into the Aliabad Sarai, Kashmir Times, 14 October 2012. The original Moghal Road passed in front of the Aliabad Sarai rest house. The current one runs behind it, at a higher elevation. Pirs Shrine representing Sheikh Ahmed Karim's meditating place The local tradition associates Saint Nund Rishi with the Peer Ki Gali. However, according to written records, a Pir called Sheikh Ahmed Karim, lived and meditated in the Peer Ki Gali during the time of emperor Jahangir. He is said to have converted to Islam from Hinduism. He regarded the Peer Ki Gali as a place of God and insisted that all the passers-by to treat it with reverence. The records also state that emperor Jahangir disregarded his commandments, but Shahjahan and Aurangzeb followed them. A shrine stands in the Peer Ki Gali, which marks the Pir's meditating place. A stone with his hand imprint is believed to have been placed inside it.

After winning two of his three starts as a juvenile he emerged as a top-class performer in 2014 when his wins included the Nikkan Sports Sho Shinzan Kinen, Arlington Cup, NHK Mile Cup and Swan Stakes. He failed to win as four-year-old but ran well in defeat in major races such as the Takamatsunomiya Kinen and the Sprinters Stakes. He reached his peak in 2016 when he won the Hankyu Hai and ran second in both the Takamatsunomiya Kinen and the Sprinters Stakes before recording his biggest win in the Mile Championship. At the end of the year he took the JRA Award for Best Sprinter or Miler. He was a front-running racehorse and was often vulnerable to fast- finishing opponents. Background Mikki Isle is a bay horse with no white markings bred in Japan by Northern Farm. In 2012 he was consigned to the Japan Racing Horse Association Sale of Yearlings and Weanlings and was bought for ¬•79,800,000 (about $954,000) by Mizuki Noda. The colt was sent into training with Hidetaka Otonashi and was ridden in most of his races by Suguru Hamanaka. He is from the fourth crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari and Makahiki. His dam Star Isle was bred in Ireland but raced in Japan where she won two minor races as a three-year-old in 2007. Her dam, Isle de France was a granddaughter of My Juliet, and was therefore related to Winona, Snaafi Dancer Lyphard's Special and Old Rosebud. Racing career 2013: two-year-old season Mikki Isle began his racing career by finishing second to Atom in a race for newcomers over 1600 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 7 September. On his next appearance the colt won a maiden race at Kyoto Racecourse, completing the 1600 metre course in a record time of 1:32.3. He ended the year at Nakayama Racecourse on 14 December by winning the Hiiragi Sho over the same distance. 2014: three- year-old season Suguru Hamanaka, who rode Mikki Isle in most of his races Mikki Isle began his second campaign in the Grade 3 Nikkan Sports Sho Shinzan Kinen at Kyoto on 12 January in which he started the 0.6/1 favourite and won by half a length from Win Full Bloom. On 1 March the colt started odds-on favourite for the Grade 3 Arlington Cup at Hanshin and recorded his fourth consecutive victory as he came home three and a half lengths clear of Tagano Grandpa. On 11 May the colt was moved up to Grade 1 class and started the 0.9/1 favourite for the NHK Mile Cup at Tokyo Racecourse with his seventeen opponents included Atom, Rosa Gigantea (Spring Stakes) and Shonan Archive (Grade 2 New Zealand Trophy). He took the lead soon after the start, repelled the sustained challenge of Horai Akiko and held off a wave of late challengers in the closing stages to win by a neck from Tagano Burg. After the race Suguru Hamanaka said \\"being sent off as heavy favorite, I'm relieved with the outcome. Unusually, he was tense in the gate and didn't break as well, but once he spurted for the lead he was faster than the others. I knew the others were closing in fast, and prayed that he would hold on to his lead. This horse has incredible speed and character. I hope he will go on to enjoy a fantastic career\\". On 8 June, over the same course and distance, Mikki Isle was matched against older horses in the Yasuda Kinen. Racing on soft ground he led for most of the way but tired badly in the straight and came home sixteenth of the eighteen runners behind Just A Way, beaten twelve lengths by the winner. After a lengthy summer break Mikki Isle returned for the Grade 2 Swan Stakes over 1400 metres at Kyoto in which he again faced older rivals. Starting the 1.5/1 favourite he won by half a length and a nose from the five-year-olds Sunrise Major and Fiero. Three weeks later the colt started favourite for the Mile Championship at the same track but after taking the lead in the straight he faded rapidly and was eased down by Hamanaka and finished unplaced behind Danon Shark. The colt was the beaten favourite again on his final start of the year, coming home seventh to Real Impact in the Grade 2 Hanshin Cup on 27 December. In the JRA Awards for 2014, Mikki Isle placed fourth behind Snow Dragon in the poll for Best Sprinter or Miler receiving 12 of the 285 votes. 2015: four-year-old season On his 2015 debut Mikki Isle was beaten a nose by the six-year-old Daiwa Maggiore, to whom he was conceding five pounds in weight, in the Grade 3 Hankyu Hai over 1400 metres on heavy ground at Hanshin on 1 March. At the end of the month the colt was dropped back in trip for the Grade 1 Takamatsunomiya Kinen over 1200 metres at Chukyo Racecourse in which he produced a strong late run down the centre of the track but was beaten half a length and a nose behind the Hong Kong challenger Aerovelocity and Hakusan Moon. In his second attempt to win the Yasuda Kinen on 7 June Mikki Isle came home fifteenth of the seventeen runners behind Maurice. Mikki Isle returned in autumn for the Sprinters Stakes over 1200 metres at Nakayama on 4 October. After tracking the leaders he went to the front 100 metres from the line but was overwhelmed by fast finishers in the final strides and was beaten into fourth place behind Straight Girl, Sakura Gospel and Ukiyono Kaze. For his final run of the year the colt was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse for the Hong Kong Sprint in which he finished seventh to the locally trained Peniaphobia after fading in the straight. 2016: five-year-old season Mikki Isle's trainer Hidetaka Otonashi Kohei Matsuyama took over the ride from Hamanaka for Mikki Isle's first three races of 2016. The horse made his seasonal debut in the Hankyu Hai on 28 February and recorded his first victory for fifteen months as he won by three quarters of a length from the gelding Omega Vendetta. Mikki Isle's second bid for the Takamatsunomiya Kinen saw him start second choice in the betting behind Big Arthur on 27 March. After racing just behind the leaders he took the lead in the straight but was overtaken by Big Arthur in the last 100 metres and finished second by three quarter of a lengths. After a break of more than six months. Mikki Isle returned to action for a second tilt at the Sprinters Stakes on 2 October. He took the lead soon after the start, maintained his advantage into the straight and looked likely to win before being caught on the line and beaten a head by Red Falx. Hamanaka was reunited with Mikki Isle for the Mile Championship at Kyoto on 20 November. The horse was made the 4.9/1 third choice in the betting behind Satono Aladdin (Swan Stakes) and Isla Bonita (Satsuki Sho) in an eighteen- runner field which also included Neorealism, Snow Dragon, Danon Shark, Young Man Power (Fuji Stakes), Fiero and Sunrise Major. Mikki Isle led from the start, fought off a sustained challenge from Neorealism and prevailed by a head from Isla Bonita despite hanging left in the closing stages. The racecourse stewards held an inquiry into the interference cause by the winner's failure to keep to a straight course but left the result unaltered. Hamanaka reported \\"I apologize for interfering with other horses in the stretch. Mikki Isle ran really well and I was able to race him in the front as planned. The horse was in good form and performed his best in the race\\". On his final racecourse appearance, Mikki Isle started favourite for the Hanshin Cup on 24 December but came home sixth of the fifteen runners behind the thre- year-old Shuji. In the JRA Awards for 2014, Mikki Isle was named Best Sprinter or Miler receiving 169 of the 291 votes to take the award ahead of Maurice (52 votes), Big Arthur (29) and Red Falx (23). In the 2016 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Mikki Isle was given a rating of 118, making him the 74th best racehorse in the world. Stud career Mikki Isle was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Shadai Stallion Station in Japan. He has also ben \\"shuttled\\" to stand at the Arrowfield Stud in New South Wales.

Columbus was initially passed over by Carnegie for funds to build a large main library, as it was against his preference for smaller branches accessible to local working class residents. Library director John Pugh traveled to New York City and secured Carnegie's $150,000 donation after bonding over their similar heritage; Carnegie was Scottish and Pugh was Welsh. The donation was later increased to $200,000 in 1903. Construction and opening Letter from Carnegie's secretary offering to fund the library The site at 96 S. Grant Avenue was the location of the Judge Noah Swayne house (also known as the Thomas Ewing Miller house), official residence of six Ohio governors, including future president Rutherford B. Hayes. The house was demolished to make way for the library. Construction lasted from 1903 to 1906 at a cost of $310,000; the city covered the remaining cost and agreed to pay at least $20,000 per year in maintenance and growth; a stipulation of Carnegie's gift. Carnegie's library was dedicated on April 4, 1907; the event included an address by the governor, as well as a message from Carnegie read by Ohio Library Association president Burton E. Stevenson. In 1921, when the City Hall building burned, the library housed the mayor and city officials until the construction of the new city hall.  Renovations  Since it initially opened, the library has undergone several major renovations and expansions to accommodate the city's increasing population. There were four additions and renovations: in the 1950s, 1961, 1990‚Äì1991, and 2015‚Äì2016. In 1953, the first expansion of the library opened, followed by a 15,000-square- foot annex in 1961. The Carnegie building was renovated in 1989, and the 1953 and 1961 additions were demolished. The 1990‚Äì1991 renovation cost $39 million, funded by a tax levy in the late 1980s. The renovation included an addition that tripled the library's space, from 87,000 square feet to 418,800 square feet. The renovation was finished on January 2, 1991 and dedicated on April 30, 1991 by First Lady Barbara Bush and Ohio governor George Voinovich. In 2007, the centennial of the Main Library, the State Library of Ohio donated a 25,000-volume collection of genealogical history to the library, now located on the third floor. In 2013, the CML was looking to connect the library building to the nearby Topiary Park. The only obstacle between the two was a small parking lot, which was part of the long-vacant Ohio School for the Deaf property. The CML purchased the property in order to obtain rights to the parking lot and replace it with a patio and park space. It paid $2.16 million for the building and its 2.24 acres in February 2013, and resold everything except the parking lot space for $1 million to the private Cristo Rey Columbus High School in March 2013. This project, inspired by the main branch of the New York Public Library and its adjoining Bryant Park, in turn inspired the CML's 2015‚Äì16 renovation of its Main Library. East facade after the 2015 renovation The latest renovation had its groundbreaking on February 24, 2015. The branch closed for the project two months later, on April 13, 2015. The 1991 addition was the focus of the renovation, replacing the windowless east facade with two stories of windows overlooking Topiary Park. 80 percent of the branch's collection was moved to storage, while the rest was relocated to other branches. The renovations were scheduled to be complete by summer 2016, in time for the library to host the World Congress of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions. The 2015 renovation did not increase square footage, though it redesigned the library's space to reduce staff and shelf space and increase multimedia space; it reduced the Main Library's capacity from approximately 1 million volumes down to 300,000. The 1991 addition was constructed before the internet was popular, and before smartphones existed; thus the 1991 building was more-so built to house books. The renovation replaced the 1991 building's stone walls and heavily tinted windows with large glass curtain walls, giving views of the nearby Topiary Park, Cristo Rey Columbus High School, and Grant Medical Center. Doorways were enlarged, and the library's cafe and gift shop were relocated to the 1991 building. Most shelves were reduced to below average adult height, allowing a less obstructed view of the interior. Additionally, park space replaced a parking lot at the building's east side, bringing Topiary Park directly up to the library building. Additionally, a concrete plaza was broken up on the building's west side, restoring the size of the library's lawn. Architecture Carnegie building Original west facade, now part of the Grand Atrium The original building was designed by Albert Randolph Ross of New York. It was built in a Beaux-Arts style (sometimes referred to as Second Renaissance Revival-style), using white Vermont marble on a gray granite base. It has two stories and a basement. The west facade is lively with arches, columns, friezes, and carved cherubs. A large frieze reads \\"Biblioteca Fons Eruditionis\\", or \\"the library, the fount of learning\\". A smaller frieze over the central entranceway reads \\"Open to all\\" in bold capital letters (Carnegie required that anyone use the libraries he funded). The facade also features a row of benches, with the inscription \\"my treasures are within\\" across them; this phrase was suggested to be used by Carnegie, in his letter awarding his funds. Friezes atop windows on the west facade mention the classical poets Virgil and Homer; other inscriptions credit Carnegie for funding the library and another has the Latin word \\"anno\\" followed by Roman numerals \\"MCMIV\\", meaning \\"the year 1904\\", when the cornerstone was laid. The interior of the Carnegie building has coffered ceilings and barrel vaults in its main corridors, along with dark green columns and pilasters, made with an imitation marble technique known as scagliola. The building was constructed with an axial plan; the site posed no difficulties, allowing for a simple symmetrical design. The Architectural Review praised its simple plan and elegant facades, writing \\"we can recollect no Renaissance building of its size more charming\\". Its original layout included a central hall, with a main reading room and general reference room on either side, with a stack-room at the back. The central structure of the west facade is advanced about two feet from its two wings, and features Ionic columns and pilasters, as well as a larger attic, giving the structure more prominence. The Carnegie building has 31,200 square feet. 1991 building The 1991 building was designed with a marble exterior and a round-arched entrance on the north side of the west facade, echoing the design of the Carnegie building. When the building was renovated in 2015‚Äì2016, most of the marble was replaced with glass curtain walls, and the round-arched entrance was replaced. The 1991 construction and 2015 renovations won the Columbus Landmarks Foundation's James B. Recchie Design Award; the latter project beat out the National Veterans Memorial and Museum and the Michael B. Coleman Government Center in 2019. Facilities and grounds View of the 1907 building and expansion, Cristo Rey Columbus school, and Topiary Park The extended library has three floors. The first floor contains the Grand Atrium, the children's section, an auditorium, meeting rooms, a gallery, a gift shop, and Carnegie's Cafe. The second floor features a reading room, newspaper room, teen room, a staff area, the fiction section, multimedia, and the Carnegie Gallery. The third floor houses the nonfiction and reference sections, local history and genealogy, a digital lab, and space for the Franklin County Genealogical & Historical Society. An atrium links the old building and the new. The main reading room, created in the 2015‚Äì2016 renovation, can seat 800 people. In the center of the west lawn is Peter Pan, a fountain and sculpture donated to the library, created in 1927 and dedicated May 18, 1928. The building features art by central Ohio artists throughout. These include three commissioned works: Vanitas by Todd Salughter, located in the Carnegie building's atrium; and Life in Sellsville 1871‚Äì1900 and Life in the Blackberry Patch, 1900‚Äì1930 by Aminah Brenda Lynn Robinson, located in the new Grand Atrium. Topiary Park Topiary Park is a public park adjacent to the library, constructed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and designed by James and Elaine Mason. The park's central feature is a topiary garden, designed to depict figures from George Seurat's 1884 painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. It is the only park based entirely on a painting. The library's 2015‚Äì16 renovation included seating and parkland constructed between the library and Topiary Park. One of the goals of the renovation was to better join the library to the park. Operations Third floor discovery board The Main Library is open seven days per week. Services offered include wireless internet, public computers and tablets, and discovery boards (consoles that aid in navigating the library and learning about it). Activities for children include children's book narrations, a reading practice area, a homework help center, a study center for teens, and a media lab. Historical and genealogical services include access to 70,000 books, records, and other materials, as well as a discovery board that highlights newly- digitized materials and historic areas of Columbus. The library currently serves a portion of the city's homeless population, as the facility offers warmth, drinking fountains, bathrooms, computers, and homeless-specific resources. Organizations The branch's gift shop, operated by the Friends of the Library The Friends of the Columbus Metropolitan Library, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, operates the library store, on the first floor of the library's new wing. The store sells books, gifts, music, clothing, and other branded items. The organization also operates a biannual sale of about 18,000 books, graphic novels, CDs, and DVDs (materials from the library that are worn or not in demand) at the branch, which raises about $15,000 each occurrence.

Lippertt. It served Clovis, California and Fresno County. The end of the Clovis was part of a larger cost-cutting effort by The McClatchy Company, which resulted in layoffs across many McClatchy papers, including the Fresno Bee and Sacramento Bee.  History  The Clovis Independent was established in 1919 by S.S. Case and May Case. May had built a reputation as a reporter in Purcell, Oklahoma at the Register. Though May and her husband Spurgeon sold the paper to Myron A. Hinkley in 1939. May continued to work for the paper until her death, at the age of 93, in 1967. In 1967, May Case was known as the \\"oldest working newspaperwoman in the United States.\\" In 1964, at age 90, May Case won the award of \\"Newspaper Girl of the Year\\" at the California Press Women's annual meeting. She also received a citation from the U.S. Treasury Department for purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds and for inspiring others to purchase these bonds. May Case bought the first bonds made available to the public, but never cashed them. October 8 was designated as May Case Day in Clovis. An explosion and resulting fire destroyed the Clovis Independent's building and printing machinery in 1930. Subsequently, Clovis Independent merged with the Tribune in 1944, which was further sold by Mr. and Mrs. Myron Hinkley to Anthony Turano in 1959. In 1968, Russ Mazzei, owner/operator of the Clovis Free Press, purchased the Clovis Independent and merged the two papers under the Clovis Independent name. In 1968, Clovis Independent was the paper of record for the city of Clovis, and the lengthy legal battle between the Independent's owner and the Free Press' owner over the designation status in the city of Clovis resulted in the merging of the two papers. Mazzei later sued the Fresno County District Attorney and a police officer for an alleged violation of his civil rights. Russ Mazei accused the District Attorney of using the power of his office against Clovis Free Press, aiming to start a competing newspaper. Mazzei was sued for a libel by the police officer in 1983, and lost. Mazzei was also the founder of the Clovis Hall of Fame, honor ‚Äúthe old timers of Clovis,‚Äù which he founded in 1975. Clovis Independent was acquired by McClatchy in 1979. In 1996, the paper's publisher, Earl Wright Jr., arranged for the football team of the town of Clovis, CA to play the football team from the town of Clovis, NM. The demise of the Clovis Independent was cited as the reason for the creation of the Clovis Roundup.  Awards  The newspaper placed second in in-depth reporting category in the California Newspaper Publishers Association's annual Better Newspapers Contest in 1987. It won first place for sports coverage and first-place sports story in 2005.

Background Clarence Miller was born in 1906 to \\"middle-class parents.\\" He joined the Young People's Socialist League \\"while still in school.\\" Career Miller was a leader of the Young Communist League. 1926 Passaic Strike In 1926, Clarence Miller was a strike leader during the Passaic strike, along with Kate Gitlow (mother of Benjamin Gitlow), Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. On February 2, 1926, Miller met with Albert Weisbord, William Weinstone, Joseph Zack, and others named Kovetz, Blumkin, Baylin, and Dyaik. International Labor Defense mentioned Miller (\\"another of the young militants\\") faced probably prison term. Jack Rubinstein and Miller was held on $10,000 bail. On May 17, 1926, the case against Rubinstein and Miller was dismissed. On June 18, 1926, Miller spoke to a YCL Youth Conference in New York City. 1929 Gastonia Strike On March 30, 1929, Fred Erwin Beal of the National Textile Workers Union led the Loray Mill strike, better known as the 1929 Gastonia Strike. In late April 1929, Miller and his wife arrived in Gastonia with CPUSA representative Jack Johnstone. On June 7, 1929, Miller was one of 16 workers arrested during the strike. Other \\"communists among the prisoners\\" included: Fred Beal, Vera Bush, Amy Schechter, and \\"19-year old Sophie Melvin of the Young Communist League.\\" All 16 faced threat of the electric chair. On October 6, 1929, Miller testified about dynamiting of strike headquarters. Edith Saunders Miller, Miller's wife, testified that \\"she had taught the children in the strikers' tent colony to strive for a Soviet-style government of workers and farmers.\\" She \\"avowed almost all of the Communist principles that Beal had carefully avoided.\\" (In 1949, Beal wrote, \\"Comrade Edith Miller was addressing the Court, but she was anticipating the commendation of Stalin's lackeys in New York and Moscow.\\") On October 21, 1929, seven of the Gastonia strike leaders and union members were found guilty of the murder of O.F. Aderholt, chief of police: Fred Beal, Clarence Miller, George Carter, Joseph Harrison, W.M. McGinnis, and Louis McLaughlin. Beal later noted, \\"It was characteristic of Southern justice that the four Yankee 'foreigners'‚ÄìGeorge Carter, Joseph Harrison, Clarence Miller, and I‚Äìwere given the more severe sentences... from seventeen to twenty years of hard labor in the State prison at Raleigh.\\" On October 31, 1929, Miller wrote a letter to Max Bedacht, who was acting Party leader at the time, following the expulsion of Jay Lovestone) in which he complained that \\"Beal had lost faith in the Party\\" and was blaming International Labor Defense for losing them the case. He suggested that the Party send Beal on a national tour to help him recover his faith. After the trial, William F. Dunne, editor of the Daily Worker, offered to help the condemned escape to the Soviet Union. Clarence Miller, his wife, Beal, and three other co-defendants secretly raised funds and secured fake passports and left the States. \\"Miller was personally all for skipping\\" bail and fleeing to Russia. Miller and Harrison traveled first. Beal traveled second. (In September 1931, when Beal made a second trip to Russia, he did so in the company of Myra Page and her husband, John Mackey.) In a 1937 article, Beal wrote, \\"I could not, like Clarence Miller and so many other complaisant dream- walkers, convince myself that the suffering and futility which I saw everywhere in Stalin-land were but figments of the Capitalist imagination.\\"In September 1931, In his 1949 memoir, he wrote: > Only Clarence Miller, who was never a worker and whose connection with the > Gastonia strike was accidental, blossomed out in Soviet Russia as a \\"Red > professor\\" and occupied a comfortable apartment, enjoying the prosperity of > Soviet bureaucracy. He worked for the Comintern, as did his wife when she traveled to Russia to live with him. On June 27, 1931, the Lovestoneite newspaper Revolutionary Age mentioned an article on the Young Communist League that \\"Clarence Miller was district organizer back in 1928.\\" On August 9, 1949, Joseph Zack Kornfeder testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) regarding Communist infiltration of American labor unions: In response to the question \\"Did many Americans attend the Academy of Red Professors?\\" he said: > There were two that I know of... Sam Don, D-O-N, who later became editor of > the Daily Worker, and another one was Miller, I believe Clarence Miller. > After his graduation he was utilized in the apparatus of the Communist > International. I don't know to what extent he became active in the American > Communist Party, however. I haven't seen his name in any public activity. Personal life and death Miller married Edith Saunders. In 1926, Miller changed from Socialist to Communist Party allegiance during the Passaic Strike. Beal stressed that Miller was \\"not of proletarian origin\\" and \\"never a proletarian.\\" According to Vera Buch Weisbord, Miller had supported Jay Lovestone but left the Lovestoneites for the main CPUSA. Weisbord (wife of the best known Passaic strike leader, Albert Weisbord‚Äìa Lovestoneite) said that the Party played up the roles of Clarence Miller and his wife; in fact, their roles in the Gastonia strike were minimal. Beal described Miller's role similarly. Legacy In 1926, Sam Krieger took \\"Clarence Miller\\" as his Party name, which he used for his chapter in the 1926 book The Law of Social Revolution, published under the lead of Scott Nearing. Miller appeared in the documentary The Passaic Film Strike (1926).

Design and development In 1918 Borel responded to two specifications for fighter aircraft, one single seat (with provision for a rear gunner and another two- seater. What emerged were two aircraft almost identical to fulfil both specifications; the Borel C1 and Borel C2. Borel C1 The C1 was designed with two fixed synchronised machine-guns, or a single machine-gun with a cannon firing through the propeller boss. Two additional machine-guns were also proposed, fired by a second crewman seated behind the pilot, known as a single-seat prot√©g√©, which mirrored the C2 specification. Development of the sole C1 was abandoned with the armistice in favour of the almost identical C2. 3/4 front v iew Borel C2 / Borel-Boccaccio Type 3000 The C2 was a two- seat fighter very similar to the C1 but with a gun ring in a separate cockpit behind the pilot and a revised cabane strut arrangement. The two-bay biplane wings had moderate stagger and were attached to the lower fuselage longerons and cabane struts under the centre section. Power was supplied by a Hispano- Suiza 8Fb driving a 2-bladed wooden propeller with a large spinner. The wooden fuselage was covered in fabric and housed two jettisonable fuel tanks and, initially, a ventral radiator for the closely cowled Hispano-Suiza 8Fb and fixed Vickers machine-gun. Provision for two cameras was made under the pilots seat and the rear gunner had two {{cvt|7.7|mm guns on a T.O.3gun ring. Testing of the Type 3000 revealed that the aircraft met the armament requirements of the specification and that the structure had a load factor of seven (could withstand 7g). Modifications included replacing the ventral radiator with two Lamblin radiators mounted on the undercarriage legs, shortened exhaust manifolds and an extra strut supporting the tailplane. Despite exceeding the performance requirements the Type 3000 was not ordered for production due to the SPAD S.XX, beating Borel to the post, having been flown and tested in 1918.

The device features front stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. The Nano Memory compared with a Nano SIM card The Mate 20 uses a 18.7:9 1080p LCD display, while the Mate 20 Pro uses a 19.5:9 1440p display with curved edges. Both displays contain notches, with the Mate 20 featuring a \\"teardrop\\" shape, and the Mate 20 Pro containing a larger tab concealing additional infrared sensors used for a face recognition system. The Mate 20 Pro includes an optical in-screen fingerprint reader. The Mate 20 uses a traditional fingerprint reader on the rear below the cameras instead. Both models support Qi inductive charging, while the Mate 20 Pro can charge other Qi-compatible devices from its own battery power. Instead of the MicroSD, the Mate 20 utilises a new, proprietary memory card format known as \\"Nano Memory\\" which exactly matches the dimensions of a nano SIM card. As such, the devices utilise a hybrid SIM tray where the second slot can be used for either expanded storage or a second SIM card. The Mate 20 features three rear-facing cameras with Leica optics in a square-shaped array, with the Mate 20 Pro using 40-megapixel wide angle IMX600, 20-megapixel ultra wide angle, and 8-megapixel telephoto sensors, and the Mate 20 using 12-megapixel, 16-megapixel ultra wide angle, and 8-megapixel telephoto sensors. Unlike previous Huawei phones, it does not include a monochrome lens for contrast adjustment and greyscale images, with the company citing improvements to the colour sensors as making it redundant. This is accompanied by improvements to Huawei's artificial intelligence object recognition system, which can now distinguish between multiple types of subjects in a scene to selectively apply enhancements (rather than only applying one to the entire photo) and can recognize 1,500 possible scenarios (a three-fold increase over the P20's similar system). The camera software also features new \\"AI Cinema\\" effects modes. Both devices feature 24-megapixel front-facing cameras. Software The Mate 20 ships with Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\". It introduces Huawei's EMUI 9 software suite, which was designed to be more streamlined in comparison to previous iterations. It includes new features such as screen gesture-based navigation, Digital Balance (a dashboard for tracking and limiting device usage), HiVision (an augmented reality object recognition experience for the camera), and Password Vault among other features. The Mate 20 series is part of the Android 10 based EMUI 10 Beta programme, and is scheduled to be updated to the most recent version of Googles Android operating system. Model variations Porsche Design The Porsche Design Huawei Mate 20 RS is a special edition of the Mate 20 Pro; its rear cover has a racing stripe motif with two stripes of leather, while it features 256 or 512 GB of storage, and 8 GB of RAM. Mate 20 X The Huawei Mate 20 X is a larger variant of the Mate 20, featuring a 7.2-inch display, a headphone jack, a 5,000 mAh battery, vapour chamber cooling and support for an optional stylus. It features the same camera setup as the Mate 20 Pro, but lacks wireless charging. Unlike the Mate 20 Pro, its display is flat, and it uses a rear-mounted fingerprint reader. The phone is using graphene film cooling technology for thermal management, and is one of the first commercial products to utilize graphene for such purposes. A 5G variant was announced on May 17, 2019. It is nearly identical to the original Mate 20 X, but has a smaller 4,200 mAh battery and support for 40W fast charging. It lacks a headphone jack and only comes in one color, Emerald Green. Mate 20 Lite The Mate 20 Lite was unveiled in August 2018, prior to the announcement of the flagship Mate 20 models. It is a mid-range phablet with a Kirin 710 system-on- chip with 4 GB of RAM, a 6.3-inch 1080p display, 3750 mAh battery, and 64 GB of storage expandable via MicroSD. It includes a 20-megapixel rear-facing camera and 24-megapixel front-facing camera, both accompanied by a secondary sensor for depth sensing. It shipped with Android 8.1 \\"Oreo\\" and EMUI 8.2. Reception Vlad Savov of The Verge felt that the Mate 20 Pro \\"[wasn't] the best overall Android smartphone\\", but argued that its specifications \\"[checked] off every wishlist item you can think of\\", and cited standout features such as its extensive battery life, and \\"iPhone-like\\" responsiveness (whilst also noting Huawei's frequent use of user interface elements strongly influenced by iOS). Its display was considered comparable to Samsung's Galaxy Note 9, but felt that the symmetry of its front and rear curves affected ergonomics. The cameras were noted as having similar quality to the P20 Pro and a macro mode, but the removal of the monochrome sensor was lamented, and the cameras were panned for overly aggressive AI enhancements and a sometimes \\"crunchy\\" appearance due to excessive sharpness. The 3D face unlock was praised for its speed, contrasting the in-screen fingerprint reader (which did not have the same performance as the capacitive sensor on the P20), while the pre-release EMUI 9 software on the review device was noted to be buggy (but that its gesture implementation made more sense than the similar one implemented on Android 9 itself). In conclusion, Savov considered the Mate 20 Pro to be \\"a hugely indulgent purchase for those who are (a) outside the US, and (b) absolutely convinced they need its extensive list of good features and desirable specs.\\" CNET was similarly positive, noting that the Mate 20 Pro \\"not only has a spec list that's the equal of any flagship phone out there, but it comes with enough new features to make it a truly exciting phone\\", and was less aggressive in its use of color saturation on photos than the P20 Pro, but panned Huawei's switch to a proprietary memory card format due to pricing and availability not having yet been announced. Some users noted that Mate 20 Pro devices with LG-manufactured displays had light bleed issues, with green tints appearing around the edges of the screen that were noticeable when displaying dark-coloured screens.

It is the fourteenth novel set in the Honorverse in the main Honor Harrington series. It was the first main series Honor Harrington book in five years.  Plot summary  The story occurs in 1922 and 1923 \\"Post Diaspora,\\" or 4025/4026 CE. The Grand Alliance of the Star Empire of Manticore, the Republic of Haven, the Protectorate of Grayson, and the newly independent Directorate of Beowulf, among others, are at war with the Solarian League as a consequence of a conflict triggered by the Mesan Alignment. The Alignment, a secret society, is determined to conquer the galaxy to remove all opposition to its plan for the genetic \\"uplift\\" of the human race. A series of previous events ‚Äî though designed to destabilize Manticore and other nations ‚Äî instead led to the defection of an agent with full knowledge of the Alignment's basic organization and goals. The Alignment thus caused almost all of its most dangerous enemies to league together for the express purpose of defeating it; in response, it ruthlessly accelerates its plans, leading to mass-casualty atrocities across the galaxy. In the Solarian League, five career bureaucrats (the \\"Mandarins\\"), who control almost all government affairs from \\"Old Chicago\\" on the League's capital, Planet Earth, continue to reject Alliance claims that the League is being manipulated by the Alignment; indeed, they deny that the Alignment even exists. In the belief that the formation of the Grand Alliance is meant to displace the League as the galaxy's preeminent power, but recognizing that the Alliance possesses an almost insurmountable military edge, the Mandarins order the Solarian League Navy (SLN) to conduct a series of hit-and-run raids on star systems friendly to the Allies. League commanders are ordered to indiscriminately destroy the civilian infrastructure of any independent system that trades with the Alliance; this abuse is later extended to any League system attempting to secede as Beowulf did. Certain to cause countless innocent deaths, the plan is in truth an Alignment plot planted within the League's doctrine to destroy its legitimacy, while also allowing the League to damage the Alliance as much as possible. The Royal Manticoran Navy annihilates one League raiding force in the Ajay System, before a smaller Manticoran force barely beats back a raid on the Hypatia System, at the cost of 90 percent casualties. Later on, the Alignment accelerates \\"Operation Houdini\\" on Planet Mesa itself, which has been occupied by the Alliance; dozens of nuclear charges are detonated across the planet to erase evidence of the Alignment's existence and frame the Alliance for the deaths of millions of civilians. Events come to a head when the League invades Beowulf with the Alignment's covert assistance. Though Alliance defenses are sabotaged by a secret Alignment weapon, the defenders nonetheless nearly wipe out the attacking League force and preserve most of the system's industrial and military infrastructure. However, the Alignment, a centuries-old enemy of Beowulf, smuggles nuclear weapons aboard its massive orbital habitats. The detonations kill more than 43 million people, mostly civilians, but also large numbers of Alliance government officials. The bombings occur well after the total defeat of the League force, because of a timing error by the Alignment's agents, conclusively proving that the Alignment is real and a dangerous threat to the entire galaxy. In response, the Alliance decides to put an end to its conflict with the League and force its government to come to terms with the threat. Admiral Honor Harrington destroys more than 2,000 years of built up infrastructure within the Solar System and imposes surrender terms on the League. Military and political leaders on Earth, having uncovered the Alignment's infiltration of the League, use the opportunity to depose the Mandarins and promulgate genuine reform. Having lost many friends and family in decades of war, Harrington vows that her military career is over, but Empress Elizabeth of Manticore remains confident that if the need arises, Honor Harrington will answer the call of duty.  Reception  Uncompromising Honor debuted at #9 on the New York Times Bestseller List.

The crowd had gathered to watch celebrations for the Hindu festival of Dussehra and were standing on the tracks. The accident occurred in the early evening, killing at least 59 people and injuring approximately an additional 100.  Incident  According to local police and news media, the spectators were standing and sitting on or near the tracks in the Joda Phatak area in the outskirts of Amritsar. The spectators were watching the burning of an effigy of Ravana as part of the Dussehra festival, when a commuter train ran into the crowd. The train was described as a diesel multiple unit (DMU) local passenger train travelling westbound from Jalandhar station to Amritsar. Witnesses claimed that another train, the Amritsar‚ÄìHowrah Mail service, had passed in the opposite direction moments earlier, and this was later confirmed by the gateman in charge of the junction. Several witnesses claimed that the train did not blow its horn when it got close to the crowds of spectators. The driver said that he both honked and applied the emergency brakes but did not come to a complete halt because the crowd had begun to pelt the train with stones. Local Congress politician Navjot Kaur Sidhu, the wife of the Member of the Legislative Assembly for Amritsar East, was the guest of honour at the event. She said she had left the site shortly before the accident occurred but that she returned as soon as she heard about it. Sidhu also said that the celebration was held there every year and that the railway authorities were alerted in advance of the need to moderate their speed.  Victims  An official told reporters that elected officials confirmed that at least 59 people were killed in the accident. By the evening of 19 October 50 bodies had been discovered and at least 50 people had been admitted to a nearby hospital while the other nine bodies were found the next day. Due to the force of the train's impact, many victims were dismembered or mutilated beyond recognition, which delayed the body identification. A local official said that most of the victims were migrant workers and their families from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar who lived in the area. Punjab navjot Singh siddhu visited some of the survivors and family members of the dead at a local hospital, on 20 October. During his visit two women met with him who had reportedly lost their entire families, including children, husbands and even in-laws. The majority of those identified were cremated at the Shitla Mata Temple in Amritsar, while a few others were sent back to their hometowns. Allegations were reported to the local media, that after the accident some of the crowd stole valuables of the victims and survivors; family members also reported that only the bodies of their relatives were returned but not their effects.  Response  Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh announced compensation of for the family of each of those killed, and free treatment for the injured. There was no immediate decision about any compensation from the railways. The central government also announced a compensation of for the family of each of the dead and for the injured. The state announced a day of mourning in honor of the victims, and Singh ordered an inquiry into how the accident had occurred. On 23 October, Navjot Singh Sidhu, Minister for Local Government, Tourism and Cultural Affairs in the Punjab State Government and husband of Navjot Kaur Sidhu, who was the guest of honour at the festival, announced that he and his wife would adopt all the children who lost parents in the accident, covering their education and all other expenses, and that women who lost their husbands would also be extended all required financial help. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ramnath Kovind offered condolences to the families of the dead and hopes that the injured would recover quickly. Video footage of the incident seemed to show several mobile phones filming after the accident, causing the former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah to criticise the reaction of the crowd.  Protest  The day after the accident, 20 October, some locals staged a sit-in protest on the railway tracks, demanding action from officials, the train driver, and \\"adequate compensation\\" for the victims. Some protesters demanded that the families of those killed receive government jobs, and placed blame on officials. Railway services were continued 40 hours after the incident.  Railway  Railways Minister Piyush Goyal, on a visit to the United States at the time of the accident, announced his immediate return to India. The route between Jalandhar and Amritsar was suspended, and the day after the incident 37 trains were cancelled, 16 trains diverted, and 18 trains terminated early. Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha stated that the railways administration had not been informed of the festival's location or timing. A senior Indian Railways official described the incident as \\"a clear case of trespassing\\" and, when asked why the train did not stop or slow as it approached, explained that there was \\"so much smoke that the driver was unable to see anything and he was also negotiating a curve.\\"  Driver  The driver reported the accident immediately to the Amritsar Junction station master and was detained by the Punjab Police and Railway Police at Ludhiana Railway Station for questioning. The driver reportedly told officials that he had received a green signal and had no idea that there were hundreds of people standing on the tracks. Railways Minister of State Manoj Sinha denied any negligence on the driver's part and stated that no action was being taken against him. The driver released a letter on 21 October which detailed his account of the crash. He said that he applied the emergency brakes and honked to disperse the crowd, but when a mob surrounded the train and threw stones at the train he continued to the next stop.

A man impersonating Malm rang the novelist John Banville on the day that the Swedish Academy intended to announce the recipients of the 2019 and 2018 Nobel Prizes in Literature. The man purporting to be Malm told Banville he had won and even read out the customary citation and asked if he would prefer to be designated the 2018 or 2019 laureate. Banville was attending a physiotherapy appointment at the time and was lying face down on a couch when the call came. He informed his daughter; she called her father back while watching the live announcement at midday to tell him his name had not been mentioned. After the announcement, a voicemail to Banville (again from the man posing as Malm) claimed the Swedish Academy had withdrawn his prize due a disagreement. Banville felt sorry for the man purporting to be Malm: \\"He certainly sounded upset, he was a very good actor\\". But he later compared the voice of the speaker to that of the real Malm, at which point he realised that neither man sounded alike.

Built about 1811, it is a high-quality example of Federal period architecture, which is likely the work of New Haven builder David Hoadley. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Colonel Asa Platt House stands in a predominantly suburban residential area northeast of the town center of Orange, at the southwest corner of Tyler City Road and Racebrook Road (Connecticut Route 114). It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. The main facade is four bays wide, with an irregular arrangement consisting of two closely spaced windows bays on the left half, a single window bay on the right, and the main entrance set off-center between these groupings. It is framed by sidelights, pilasters, and a half-round transom window, and is sheltered by a gabled portico supported by chamfered square posts. Above the entrance is a three-part window with narrow sash windows on either side of a larger central one. Its elements are articulated by slender pilasters, and both the sill and cornice of the grouping are bracketed. The fine woodwork continues inside, with arched openings framing the staircase and hall, and original builtin cabinetry. With The house was probably built not long after Asa Platt purchased the land on which it stands in 1810. Passed to his unmarried daughters, it was eventually taken by the town for taxes, and served for a time as its poor farm. In 1847, the town sold it to William Russell, in whose family it remained in the late 20th century. The house's design is attributed to David Hoadley on account of its exceptionally fine detailing and workmanship, and by comparison to the few documented residential works of the builder.

Gilbert and composed by Lawrence Wright (some sources credit him under his pseudonym Horatio Nicholls) about British aviator Amy Johnson. It was recorded by Jack Hylton and his orchestra on 2 June 1930, with J. Pat O'Malley providing vocals, and released on HMV B-5836. The banjo and ukelele arrangement was provided by Alvin Keech. While at least ten songs were written about her at the time, \\"Amy Wonderful Amy\\" is the most famous. Background Amy Johnson was an English aviator who in 1930 flew solo from the United Kingdom all the way to Australia . She was the first female pilot to do so. After landing in Australia she became world famous overnight and the euphoria inspired Joseph G. Gilbert and Lawrence Wright to write a song about a man who expresses his admiration and love for her. The song has an instrumental break in which a news reporter describes her flying past several locations (Vienna, Baghdad, Karachi, Port Darwin and Brisbane, Australia) until he fears that she might've crashed, but it turns out she is safe after all. After a reprisal of the refrain the song ends with sounds of people cheering. Recording It was recorded by Jack Hylton and his orchestra only nine days after Johnson's arrival. Ten per cent of the royalties would be sent to The Daily Sketch fund to buy her a new plane. Other versions The song has also been recorded by: * 1930 - The Rhythm Maniacs, sang by Maurice Erwin. * 1930 - The Debroy Somers Band, sang by Tom Barratt. * 1930 - Harry Bidgood & His Band. * 1930 - Chris Hall, aka John Thorne. * 1930 - Arthur Lally & The Million-Airs. * 1930 - Arthur Rosebery & His Kit-Kat Dance Band. * 1930 - Tom Barratt. * 1930 - G.

It aired on November 7, 2018, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Asha Michelle Wilson, and directed by Jennifer Arnold. Plot Dinah breaks a protective spell that Cordelia placed on Miss Robichaux's Academy letting Michael and Ms. Mead in. They murder most of the witches, including Zoe, Queenie, and Bubbles, but Cordelia, Myrtle, and Mallory escape. Michael meets with Jeff and Mutt, who tell him that the Cooperative is a new name for the Illuminati, an organization of elites who have sold their souls to the Devil in exchange for worldly gifts, and who want to end the world. Jeff and Mutt give Ms. Venable the job of administrator of Outpost 3. Cordelia, Myrtle, and Mallory, with Madison and Coco, take refuge in Misty Day's shack. Cordelia tries and fails to resurrect Zoe and Queenie, and Madison reveals that Langdon has the capability to erase souls from existence. Myrtle reveals that there might be a way to bring the dead witches back in the form of a time-travel spell, known as tempus infinitum, but mentions that every attempt to perform the spell has resulted in death. Myrtle believes Mallory to be capable of performing the spell, and asks to travel back in time to save Anastasia Romanov, who was a witch, from her execution. Mallory successfully travels back in time, but is unable to save Anastasia. Cordelia contemplates dying to let Mallory rise as Supreme, and therefore be able to perform the spell. Myrtle discourages her, certain that she has some fight left. The witches travel to California to seek aid from Behold and John Henry, only to find them and their students murdered (presumably by Langdon and Mead). Michael meets with the Cooperative, and they begin to plan ending the world. Reception \\"Fire and Reign\\" was watched by 1.65 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.8 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received mixed reviews. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Fire and Reign\\" holds a 53% approval rating, based on 17 reviews with an average rating of 6.87/10. The critical consensus reads: \\"Not even a pitch-perfect reference to Omen III could keep Apocalypse's penultimate episode from succumbing to the franchise's penchant for uneven pacing and meandering character arcs.\\" Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 3/5, saying, \\"Despite my issue with [the possibility of time travel], the episode itself has a lot of positives. The scenes with Mutt (Billy Eichner) and Jeff (Evan Peters) are broad, but they're a funny exaggeration of tech bro culture. The two actors have a solid delivery of big comedy lines, and they're a good counterbalance to the more unpleasant aspects of the episode. Billie Lourd is exceptional this week, and her screaming fit after being dragged from Tsarist Russia back to the present is powerful. She's in a full-fledged shrieking panic, and it's a great cap on a very interesting flashback scene.\\" He added, \\"Jennifer Arnold has a solid hand with the actors, but a better hand with the action sequences that take place this week.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an C+. As the episode is the penultimate of the season, she criticized the fact that it was \\"still mired in backstory\\", as it was giving the impression of an \\"endless scene- setting\\". She was also disappointed by many story elements like the reason why Dinah chose to help Michael and Mead; the easy explanation given for the apocalypse; and the fact that time travel might be the solution to stop the Antichrist. She disliked the cliffhanger of the episode, commenting that it was just \\"people in very silly hats flipping to Page 6 of their End of Days marketing binders.\\" Finally, she was unimpressed by the Bolshevik revolution flashback, and the revelation that Anastasia Romanova was a witch. Vultures Ziwe Fumudoh gave the episode a 5 out of 5. Much like Rosenfield, she was disappointed by Dinah and the reason she helped Michael and Mead, calling it \\"underwhelming\\". She also criticized Michael for being \\"as directionless as a boat with no sails, rudder, or Sperrys.\\", and was left unimpressed by the Bolshevik revolution flashback. However, she enjoyed Robot Mead and her role in the killing of witches, commenting she has \\"a fancy design feature that is both functional and terrifying\\". She was also a fan of the scenes between Mutt (Eichner), Jeff (Peters) and Venable (Paulson). Overall, she appreciated the episode, thinking that it covered a lot of ground and that \\"this season of American Horror Story is coming together\\".

It aired on November 14, 2018, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Ryan Murphy & Brad Falchuk, and directed by Bradley Buecker. Plot Myrtle infiltrates Jeff and Mutt's lab to ensure Coco and her family have a place at Outpost 3 after the apocalypse. She and Cordelia cast identity spells on Coco and Mallory so they can live in the Outpost undetected by Michael. When Mallory's powers emerge, the spells will be broken so she can perform tempus infinitum and go back in time to kill Michael before he can initiate the apocalypse. Madison realizes Dinah, the voodoo queen, betrayed the witches to Michael. Cordelia decides to commit revenge after the apocalypse. After the apocalypse and following the events of \\"Could It Be... Satan?\\", Dinah asserts her loyalty to Michael, but her predecessor as voodoo queen, Marie Laveau, has been released from hell by Papa Legba in exchange for Dinah's more evil soul. Marie kills Dinah and Cordelia makes robot Mead explode. With Michael distracted, Madison shoots him dead. Before Michael can resurrect, Cordelia and Myrtle take Mallory to a safe place to begin the spell, but Mallory is stabbed by Brock leaving her too weak to perform the spell. Myrtle then immolates Brock and he falls to his death, distracting Madison long enough for Michael to resurrect. After reviving, Michael kills Madison, Marie and Coco. Cordelia kills herself so that Mallory will become supreme and be able to initiate the spell. Mallory arrives in 2015, and kills Michael by running him over, while Constance Langdon watches and leaves him to die in the street. Mallory arrives at the Robichaux Academy and meets the other witches (for the first time, from their perspective). With the timeline altered, Myrtle remains dead and Madison remains in hell, though Mallory resolves to release the latter. Mallory also saves Queenie from her death in (\\"Battle Royale\\") by telling her to avoid the Hotel Cortez. Out of gratitude to Mallory for dispatching Michael, Misty Day & Nan are returned from hell, but Nan decides to return to Hell. In 2020, Timothy and Emily, selected for Outpost 3 in the previous timeline for their genetic material in (\\"The End\\"), meet.

Her exchanges with Michael are some of the best on the show\\" before concluding by \\"Even though the episode leans towards voiceover by the end, as Mallory explains her status as the Billy Pilgrim of the American Horror Story universe, it's still a very satisfying ending.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A+. She was pleased by the end of the pre-apocalypse flashbacks, and the entire showdown between the witches and Langdon. She also enjoyed the return of Bassett's Marie Laveau and the demise of Dinah. She noticed and appreciated the \\"double sci-fi homage\\" during Robot Mead's destruction, describing it as \\"a Scanners-style body explosion, followed by a very Space Odyssey rendition of \\"Daisy, Daisy\\" by her dying, decapitated head.\\" Finally, she praised the return of Lange's Constance, commenting that \\"this finale was already A-grade material, but this second glorious cameo from Jessica Lange merits a \\"plus\\".\\" Vultures Ziwe Fumudoh gave the episode a 5 out of 5.

She also enjoyed the death of Langdon, saying that \\"it's mean but so delicious\\", and Lange's \\"impeccable monologue\\" at the start of the scene.

It was fought by a French army of 20,000, jointly commanded by the Marquis de Vaubrun and the Comte de Lorges, and an Imperial Army of 30,000 under Raimondo Montecuccoli. After two months of manoeuvring, the previous French commander, Marshall Turenne, had managed to create an opportunity to attack the Imperial army. While reviewing his position on 27 July, he was killed by a cannon shot; he had not appointed a successor, and the French army was paralysed as de Lorges and Vaubrun argued over command. On 31 July, the French withdrew over the Rhine, using the bridge at Altenheim, but only part of the army managed to cross, leaving the majority on the German side. As they resumed crossing on 1 August, the Imperial army attacked, and at one point cut off their retreat by capturing Altenheim. A series of charges by the French cavalry recaptured the bridge, in one of which Vaubrun was killed; the battle ended late in the day, both sides suffering heavy casualties. Although the French saved their army, they lost the initiative established by Turenne. Background de Lorges; his quarrel with Vaubrun impacted French effectiveness Both France and the Dutch Republic viewed the Spanish Netherlands as essential for their security and trade, making it a contested area throughout the 17th century. France occupied much of it in the 1667 to 1668 War of Devolution, before returning it to Spain in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. After this, Louis XIV decided the best way to force concessions from the Dutch was by defeating them first. When the Franco-Dutch War began in May 1672, French troops quickly over-ran much of the Netherlands, but by July, the Dutch position had stabilised. The unexpected success of this offensive encouraged Louis to make excessive demands, while concern at French gains brought the Dutch support from Brandenburg-Prussia, the Emperor Leopold, and Charles II of Spain. In August 1673, an Imperial army entered the Rhineland; facing war on multiple fronts, the French relinquished most of their earlier gains. In January 1674, Denmark joined the anti-French coalition, followed by the February Treaty of Westminster, which ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War. The Allies agreed to focus on expelling France from its remaining positions in the Netherlands, while an Imperial army opened a second front in Alsace. Turenne, French commander in the Rhineland, was ordered to prevent them breaking into Eastern France, or linking up with the Dutch. Using a mixture of aggression, speed and daring, in 1673 he won a series of victories over the Imperialists, despite being outnumbered. The campaign that began in June 1674 and ended with his death in July 1675, has been described as 'possibly Turenne's most brilliant campaign.' He fought Bournonville to a standstill at Entzheim in early October, followed by a surprise winter attack, ending in victory at the Battle of Turckheim in January 1675. Turenne confirmed his psychological dominance over Bournonville, and by cutting him off from Strasbourg, prevented an invasion of Alsace. In the spring, Bournonville was reinforced by 25,000 men under Raimondo Montecuccoli, one of the few generals that contemporaries considered Turenne's equal. By late May, the Imperial army was on the move, aiming to re-establish contact with Strasburg. The next two months were spent in a series of marches and counter- marches, Turenne seeking always to remain in close contact with the Imperialists; a number of minor encounters took place, Vaubrun being wounded in a skirmish on 24 July, Local geography restricted operations to a relatively narrow corridor between the left bank of the Rhine and the Black Forest. Persistent rain in the first half of June made movement almost impossible, other factors including the need to stay close to rivers in order to receive supplies, and shortage of forage for cavalry and transport. By the end of July, Montecuccoli reached Gro√üweier, near Salzbach, where he stopped and waited for Aeneas de Caprara to join him from Offenburg. Having decided to attack, on 27 July Turenne was scouting positions for his artillery when he was killed by a chance shot from a cannonball. Battle Turenne's death was initially concealed from the troops, but soon became common knowledge, severely impacting French morale. He had not appointed a successor, his deputies being his nephew, the Comte de Lorges, and the Marquis de Vaubrun, who was the senior officer. According to the Marquis de Feuqui√®res, they spent the next three days arguing over who should assume command, at one point drawing swords on each other in the middle of the camp. The result was the French simply held their position, and the two armies spent the next three days bombarding each other. On 29 July, Imperial cavalry attacked the nearby village of Willst√§tt, hoping to capture the French baggage train, and re- establish direct communication with Strasburg. The attack was repulsed, but the danger of their position forced de Lorge and de Vaubrun to compromise, by agreeing to rotate command daily. On 31 July, the French moved towards the bridge over the Rhine at Altenheim, a small town in the modern German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg; as they did so, Montecuccoli made another attempt on Willst√§tt. With the enemy so close, de Lorges and de Vaubrun now argued over whether to get their men over the Rhine as soon as possible, leaving the baggage behind, or to save it, and run the risk of the army being divided. They agreed on the latter, since their troops were understandably opposed to the idea of abandoning their personal possessions, but when night came on 31st, Vaubrun and the vanguard were on the French bank of the Rhine, leaving the main body under de Lorges on the other. De Lorges began crossing early on the morning of 1 August, but to reach the bridge at Altenheim, they first had to cross the Schutter. While a relatively minor obstacle, it still caused a delay, and provided Montecuccoli an opportunity to destroy the larger part of the French army. The French rearguard was made up of the Brigade de Champagne, and two British regiments, including one composed largely of Irish Catholics, commanded by George Hamilton. One of his junior officers was Patrick Sarsfield, who provided details of the battle in a letter sent shortly afterwards. He writes that around 10:00 am, they were attacked by the main Imperial army, while Croatian light cavalry simultaneously cut off their retreat by taking the bridge at Altenheim. The French were now in a very dangerous situation, but recaptured Altenheim after a series of desperate cavalry charges, in one of which Vaubrun was killed. According to Sarsfield, fighting continued until 18:30, with the French rearguard repulsing repeated attacks on the bridge. The Imperialists suffered over 4,500 casualties, the French around 3,000, including 1,200 dead; the two British regiments lost 700 killed or wounded out of 1,400 engaged. Aftermath The French withdrew to S√©lestat and Cond√© assumed command; despite his distinguished record, he was in poor health and this would be his last campaign. On 11 August, a French force of 15,000 sent to relieve Trier was defeated at Konzer Br√ºcke and Trier surrendered in September. Estimating Imperial strength at over 30,000, and unwilling to risk losing the only remaining French army in the Rhineland, Cond√© took up position at the fortified town of Ch√¢tenois. Montecuccoli attempted to lure him out, but with French cavalry raiding his supply lines and winter coming on, he abandoned the attempt, In the first week of November, his army recrossed the Rhine and went into winter quarters.

Her memoir was published anonymously, with Lady of Boston listed as its author. The memoir states its intention is to provide \\"a Christian testimony, chronicling Spear's spiritual evolution by framing her life story with her religious development.\\" The writer of the Memoir of Mrs. Chloe Spear comments on the institution of slavery as well as on Christianity and its teachings. Life Chloe Spear was enslaved from around the age of 12. She was born in 1749, and probably arrived in Philadelphia in 1761. Spear was purchased and became a slave to the prominent Boston family of Captain John Bradford. According to researcher Jared Ross Hardesty, throughout her enslavement, Spear was \\"free to engage in a number of 'domestic avocations.'\\" Spear's mistress valued her skills, and even offered to have her care for a sick neighbor. Although Chloe Spear‚Äôs master was grateful for her service to his family and gave her some freedom while living with them, when he caught her learning how to read, he \\"threatened to suspend her by her two thumbs and severely whip her if he found her doing so again.\\" After the Revolutionary War, Spear and the Bradfords traveled to Andover, Massachusetts, approximately twenty miles north of Boston. However, they eventually all returned to Boston together. Records of the Second Baptist Church in Boston show that Chloe Spear was baptized there and later married a man named Cesar Spear. During their marriage, Chloe and Cesar Spear had seven children, all of whom she outlived. After Massachusetts abolished slavery in 1783, Spear and her husband opened a boarding house for sailors and workers. After Cesar's death, the establishment also served as a site for religious meetings and social gatherings for people of all races. This led to Spear becoming a beloved figure in both white and black religious and working communities. Spear died from severe arthritis and \\"rheumatic affections\\" in 1815; she was buried in the Bradford family's vault, located in Boston's Granary Burial-Place. Spear was featured in five obituaries across Boston newspapers. A minister wrote a biography of her, which was published in a Baptist missionary magazine.\\" The first biographical account of her life was in 1832 by Dr. Thomas Baldwin, a minister of the Second Baptist Church, who published the Memoir of Mrs. Chloe Spear. It was published just two months after she passed away. Memoir Spear's Memoir begins with the words, \\"In noticing the dates, it will be perceived that the subject of the Memoir has been dead, a little more than seventeen years, is introduced in the preface of the Memoir.\\" The author of the Memoir does not give herself a name, calling herself only \\"A Lady of Boston\\" or \\"A Member of the Second Baptist Church in Boston\\". The author of the \\"memoir\\" was apparently a white woman who was a fellow congregant at Boston‚Äôs Second Baptist Church. The Memoir highlights Spear's piety and industry. It describes the torture that Spear endured from her master for learning how to read, despite which she continued her quest for knowledge. The Memoir does not describe the connection that Spear had with other women and men of color, however. Spear's will Other sources corroborate and augment many of the Memoir‚Äôs details about Spear‚Äôs religious activities and her property acquisition. Primary among these is Spear's will, which she signed with an X. Spear's will left five hundred dollars to her grandson, who lived in Salem at the time. Additionally, she gave clothing, linen, and twenty to twenty-five dollars each to six women, \\"most of them identifiable as women of color who attended Second Baptist Church.\\" Along with these individuals, \\"fifty dollars apiece went to Cesar Fletcher, whom Spear identified as a man of Colour named for my late husband, and Primus Grounds, a Man of Colour and at Present a member of the Second Baptist Church in this town.‚Äù By comparing Spear's will to fifty contemporary estates, historian Margot Minardi has shown that Spear had amassed significant property despite having been enslaved for thirty years. Items listed in Spear's estate included: \\"utilitarian household items (such as a 'Bake Kettle Spider & old Skillett'); the tools of a laundress ('1 Pair Flat Irons,' '1 Folding Board & Bench'); and several luxury goods and furnishings ('1 Ebony Tea Table,' '2 Small Looking Glasses,' '5 Pictures,' and a seven-dollar 'Brass Fire Sett').\\" Her assets included $625 in ‚ÄúNotes of Hand,‚Äù or IOUs. Although Spear clearly economized, Minardi concluded, \\"she also allowed herself some of the household goods that served as markers of refinement in the early nineteenth century.\\" References Category:1815 deaths Category:Free Negroes Category:18th- century American slaves Category:American diarists Category:Women diarists Category:1767 births ","title":"Chloe Spear"},{"id":"58825548","text":"Tom√°≈° Pet≈ô√≠ƒçek (born 27 September 1981) is a Czech politician, and since October 2018 the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic in the second government of Andrej Babi≈°.

Background  De Long was born in 1879 to George and Arabella M. de Long in Montclair, New Jersey. De Long's father and younger sister were semi-invalids, so de Long became a caregiver for her family at an early age. Her family moved with her to Northampton, Massachusetts, when de Long started attending Smith College in 1897, so that she would still be able to care for them. While a student, de Long had to take out loans, work as a tutor, and teach at the Easthampton High School. After she graduated from Smith in 1901, she worked as a teacher at Central High in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1905, she moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where she taught English at the Manual Training High School for five years.  Settlement schools  De Long was invited by May Stone and Katherine Pettit to become the principal of the Women's Christian Temperance Union Settlement School in Hindman, Kentucky, later to become the Hindman Settlement School. In 1912, de Long joined Pettit in leaving Hindman to establish the Pine Mountain Settlement School. In the division of labor determined by Pettit and de Long, de Long was responsible for the academic and industrial departments and supervised the fiscal and administrative work of the school. Among her many contributions to the school, de Long assisted with the physical design of the school and was a skilled fundraiser. In 1913, de Long enlisted the help of the architect Mary Rockwell Hook to create a master plan for the new school. De Long's network of women she had met while at Smith College also proved a useful base for fundraising and for hiring workers for the school. She traveled all over the country, giving talks at schools and organizations to raise money for the school.  Personal life  In April 1918, de Long married Luigi Zande, an Italian stonemason who had been working at Pine Mountain. Zande built a cottage at the school for them to live in, which came to be known as the Zande House and is still in use at Pine Mountain. The Zandes had two children: Alberto, born in Louisville, Kentucky on March 19, 1919; and Elena, born on December 28, 1922, who was adopted.  Later life  De Long died on March 18, 1928, of breast cancer. In her honor, the Montclair Pine Mountain Association placed a brass memorial plate in the transept of the Pine Mountain Chapel.

It lived during the Middle Devonian period of the Paleozoic era.  Paleoecology  Siphonophrentis gigantea was aquatic, like all coral. It is part of the phylum Cnidaria, and possessed a polyp that lived inside of its calyx. It had a limestone skeleton (the only part that survives fossilization) covered with soft tissue, and would have anchored themselves by the apical end to the sea bed, while the tentacles of the polyp caught prey. According to one study, Siphonophrentis gigantea may have been a deep-water species of coral. The limestone matrix of one specimen was tested for calcium carbonate, which is made up of microfossils. This would indicate that the matrix was rich in nutrients when the rock was formed, meaning it was likely in deep water where nutrients are more plentiful. Because of this, the species likely had no association with Zooxanthellae (a microorganism that has a symbiotic relationship with most extant coral), and therefore was likely colorless and unable to photosynthesize. This study also indicated that this species grew upwards at a rate of approximately every 399 days (a year in the Devonian).

In 2017 she became the first woman to be awarded the Eddington Medal by the Royal Astronomical Society. Education Clarke was educated at the University of Oxford where she received a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1987 for research on binary stars supervised by Geoffrey Bath. Her doctoral thesis was titled \\"Accretion disc structure in binary star and galactic potentials\\".  Research  Clarke studies astrophysical fluid dynamics, including accretion and protoplanetary discs and stellar winds. She was the first to demonstrate how protoplanetary disc formation around low-mass young stars is determined by their radiation field. This removes material from the disc and is integral for various models of planet formation and migration. Clarke uses hydrodynamical simulations to study the physics of photoevaporation. In 2001 she was awarded the University of Cambridge Pilkington Prize for teaching and learning. She co-authored the Principles of Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics textbook with Bob Carswell in 2014. It is a primer for the fluid dynamics required to understand astronomical phenomena. She developed the course in 1996, and delivered it as part of Part II Astrophysics between 1996 and 1999. She contributed to the book Dynamics of Young Star Clusters and Associations in 2015. Her recent work has combined analytical observation and hydrodynamical simulations in exoplanet discovery. She demonstrated the first evidence of external disc photoevaporation in a low mass star in 2017. The star studied was IM Lup, which was shown to have a CO (carbon monoxide) halo that extends beyond 1,000 AU. Clarke identified a young star with four planets, the size of Jupiter and Saturn, in orbit around it. The star, CI Tau, hosts the first Hot Jupiter candidate in a protoplanetary disc system. She used the Atacama Large Millimeter Array to search for nearby planets. The closest is in an equivalent orbit to Mercury, whilst the furthest has an orbit three times that of Neptune. The two outer planets are similar masses to the sun. She demonstrated that proximity to nearby stars impacts the lifetime of protoplanetary discs. She serves as editor of the Elsevier Journal, New Astronomy Reviews. She is a member of the International Astronomical Union. Clarke's other research interests include self-gravity in disc evolution and formation of brown dwarfs in unstable multiple systems.

It is a Houston, Texas, based American petroleum company established in January 2014 with offices in New Orleans. It is privately held with large investments from Russian oligarchs who are close to Vladimir Putin's inner circle. Ownership and management As of July 2018, Konstantin Nikolaev, Mikhail Yuriev, and Andrey Kunatbaev have a combined 88% stake in American Ethane and Alexander Voloshin has a secret 2.5% share worth $1.25 million in 2014 under an AV SPV in the remaining 12%. Also in July 2018, Houghtaling confirmed that Alexander Abramov, who is Roman Abramovich's partner in Evraz, is an investor in American Ethane. Beginning in January 2014, Roman Abramovich was an investor with American Ethane but left in April 2017. John Houghtaling II, a co-founder, is the CEO. James Glickenhaus and J. M. ‚ÄúJim‚Äù Collingsworth serve on the Board of Directors. History In January 2014, Roman Abramovich through his Millhouse LLC, which is a Moscow-based asset management company, signed an agreement at the John Houghtaling II house in New Orleans and made a $50 million investment in the American Ethane Company but backed out in late 2015 after the Russian intervention in Ukraine and the Russian annexation of Crimea because of sanctions against Russia. Nikolaev's investment was pivotal to keep American Ethane from becoming insolvent which would force a bankruptcy. In April 2017, Abramovich recouped $21 million to his Eucla Investments Ltd for the debt owed to Abramovich from Houghtaling of American Ethane. Since 2015, American Ethane has aggressively increased its market share in China receiving more than 7.2 million tons of ethane per year for power generation in General Electric plants. Announced on November 9, 2017, during the U.S.-China Business Exchange attended by both President Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, the Nanshan Group of China agreed to a $26 billion 20-year trade deal to receive liquid ethane from American Ethane. The agreement occurred in June 2017. China will cracker the ethane into ethylene, which is used to make plastics. The United States is the largest supplier of ethane in the world. Houghtaling stated that his main competition for ethane to China is from Russia and Vladimir Putin. In 2018, American Ethane began constructing the largest United States export terminal for ethane on the Gulf Coast. Energy & Minerals Group (EMG), established in Houston by John T. Raymond in 2006, is co-developing the 10 million ton per year ethane port. Construction is to be completed by 2020. When this port is completed, Houghtaling expects to export more than 7.2 million tons of ethane from this port to China annually which is double the total United States exports of ethane in 2017. As of July 2018, American Ethane has contracts totaling $72 billion over 20 years to export ethane from the United States Gulf Coast to China. Lobbyists and campaign contributions From April 2014 to January 2015 Haley Barbour's BGR Group received $220,000 and lobbied through Ed Rogers, Walker Roberts, Lauren Monroe and Erskine Wells for American Ethane, but were replaced in October 2017 with Lindsay Sander from Austin Texas based Sander Resources and Kyle Ruckert from Louisiana based Bold Strategies. From January 1, 2017, to July 28, 2018, American Ethane made numerous political contributions to Conservative Louisiana, Bill Cassidy, Mike Johnson, John Kennedy, Garret Graves, Scalise Leadership Fund, and Pelican PAC. Controversies Since at least 20% of the ownership of American Ethane is foreign, American Ethane lobbyists, which is the BGR Group, must declare that they are lobbying for foreign interests; however, the BGR Group has never disclosed this. This disclosure to both Congress and the Department of Justice is required by federal law under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and operating as an unregistered agent of foreign interests is a felony offense under FARA, with a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Further, the lobbyists for American Ethane, which is registered as a Texas firm, have made large political contributions, which are legal, to influence Louisiana politicians although American Ethane's large expansion and development project is in Texas. Also, Voloshin, Abramovich or Abramov have never been listed as investors by American Ethane's website nor by its publications although these foreigners have significant interests in American Ethane. Finally, Konstantin Nikolaev is a partner and close associate of Vladimir Putin's inner circle through Igor Levitin, Alexey Mordashov, Arkady Rotenberg, and Gennady Timchenko.

Taxonomy All Freyella species occur in very deep water, and are gathered only occasionally from isolated locations, almost exclusively by dredging or using a beam trawl. Targeted collection is virtually impossible and the material that is brought up is almost never intact. That makes the description and naming of species complicated. In 1986, Maureen Downey published the results of a study she had done on the deep sea starfish from the Atlantic that had been described at that time. One of her findings was that the species described by Verrill in 1884 and named by him as Brisinga elegans, had later been redefined by several authors under different names, and she reduced these names to synonyms of Freyella elegans. Description This starfish has a small disc and normally twelve long, rather rigid arms, about long. The hexagonal plates on the aboral (upper surface) of the disc bear one to three spinelets and are covered by a membrane with no pedicellariae. The madreporite is near the margin of the disc and the anus is quite distinct and near the centre of the disc. The spines on the lateral plates are short and robust. The arms are long, narrow and cylindrical at the proximal end near the disc, widening slightly and becoming cigar-shaped distally and tapering near the tips. Here, the membrane covering them is semi- transparent, and there are saddle-like bands, and many small pedicellariae. Underneath the arms, the ambulacral groove occupies more than half the width of each arm. The outer spines around the mouth on the oral (lower surface) of the disc form a bar across the ambulacral grooves. Distribution This starfish is a bathydemersal species living in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, at depths of around . It has been detected between Cape Hatteras and the Georges Bank, as well as near Greenland and in the Gulf of Guinea. Ecology Little is known of the feeding habits of this species. Although some members of the Brisingida have been photographed with their arms raised, apparently filter feeding, those in the genus Freyella have only been observed lying flat on the sediment and are therefore probably not suspension feeders; some have been found to have the exoskeletons of small crustaceans within their buccal cavities.

It gives patients the option of submitting a symptom-related questionnaire online to a GP. In January 2018, it was said to have managed 29,000 patient episodes in a dozen practices. A pilot scheme backed by the Health and Social Care Board was introduced in Northern Ireland in 2016. This gave patients the option of explaining their symptoms to a receptionist by telephone or completing the same questionnaire on line themselves. 70% of the patients at a Falls Road, Belfast practice said it was an improvement. The algorithm gives GPs more information about the patient‚Äôs ailment than the traditional eight- to-10-minute face-to-face consultation. It was introduced to the Riverside Group Practice in Portadown in 2016. The chair of the British Medical Association's Northern Ireland GP committee, said: \\"We introduced AskmyGP nine months ago at the practice where I work and there were complaints during the first two weeks while everyone got used to it, but now all the patients love it.\\" When tried at a practice in Ipswich it wasn‚Äôt favoured by all the staff at the surgery, but it was reported that \\"The ability to signpost to the free NHS physiotherapy self-referral service saves face to face surgery appointments.‚Äù A single-handed GP with almost 5,000 patients in Shotts, Lanarkshire signed up to it when she could not recruit partners to the practice. 60-70% of patients now use it and this has enabled the practice to expand without recruiting another doctor as the work can now be managed by a multidisciplinary team of advanced nurse practitioner, advanced practice physiotherapist, mental health worker and nurses skilled in long-term management.

Early life and family Belsay Castle, the former seat of the Middleton baronets of Belsay Castle Middleton was the eldest son of Sir John Middleton, 2nd Baronet and his wife Frances Lambert, daughter of John Lambert of Calton, Yorkshire, and grand daughter of the Cromwellian general John Lambert. The Middleton family lived at Belsay in Northumberland from the thirteenth century. Middleton succeeded to the estates and baronetcy on the death of his father on 17 October 1717. While he was a minor, his chief trustee was the Presbyterian minister at Belsay. He owned a first-rate stud, bred from newly imported Arabian horses, and was a member of the Jockey Club. According to family tradition Middleton ‚Äòwas always borrowing money and always in debt‚Äô He married Anne Ettrick, daughter of William Ettrick of Silksworth, county Durham in May 1725. Career The Middleton family had represented Northumberland in Parliament since early in the fifteenth century. When Middleton came of age, he was returned unopposed as a Whig Member of Parliament for Northumberland at the 1722 general election. As a Presbyterian, he attracted the Presbyterian vote, of which the farmers made up a considerable part. He represented Northumberland for the rest of his life, and usually supported the Government. He was returned unopposed again at the 1727 general election and in a note of dissent, voted against the government on the excise bill of1733. At the 1734 general election, there was a contest at Northumberland at enormous cost to the candidates, and Middleton's fellow candidate, Ralph Jenison, was financially crippled by it. In that parliament Middleton's dissent was expressed by a vote against the place bill of 1740. He was returned unopposed at the 1741 general election. In May 1742 under an opposition bill he was chosen as one of the commissioners of public accounts, but the bill was rejected in the House of Lords. Middleton went with the Duke of Cumberland when he passed through Northumberland in January 1746 to assume command of the army in Scotland. Although Middleton was a civilian he was made a colonel and placed on the Duke's staff. At the 1747 and 1754 general elections, he was returned unopposed again for Northumberland.

The MSG Sphere will be located east of Las Vegas Sands' Venetian resort and just off the Las Vegas Strip. Once complete, the sphere-shaped venue will have a capacity of 17,500 and will feature LED screens inside and outside of the venue. Las Vegas Sands contributed the 18-acre site for the project. The sphere was designed by Populous. The property will include 304 parking spaces, while additional spaces will be available at the parking garages for the nearby Venetian, Palazzo, and Sands Expo. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 27, 2018, and was attended by approximately 300 people, including Las Vegas Sands' Sheldon Adelson and Nevada governor Brian Sandoval. In November 2018, it was reported that the MSG Sphere would be built along with new bars, private suites, a museum and retail space.MSG Sphere project calls for bars, museum, private suites, new Monorail stop AECOM began working on the site in February 2019, through a preliminary agreement. AECOM had worked on several other stadiums, including the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Excavation was underway in March 2019. Approximately 110,000 cubic yards of dirt and caliche were excavated to prepare the site for construction. AECOM was named as the general contractor in June 2019. The project had 400 construction workers. This number was expected to eventually reach a peak of 1,500. As of August 2019, Madison Square Garden estimated the project to cost $1.2 billion, while AECOM projected costs at $1.7 billion. Negotiations were underway to lower the costs. By October 2019, construction crews had completed an basement as well as the first ground level of the sphere. The basement area will be used as public space for events. Excavation went as deep as 21 feet for construction of the basement. In December 2019, the sphere reached 65 feet in height with the completion of a fourth level. MSG Sphere will have a total of eight levels upon completion, and will be the largest spherical building in the world at . In February 2020, Madison Square Garden said that the cost of the project had been increased to $1.66 billion as a result of design changes consisting of guest enhancements. That month, the world's fourth-largest crane was set up on the site's northeast side for the purpose of lifting heavy construction materials. The crane is capable of standing up to 580 feet. In a disassembled state, the crane was transported across the Atlantic Ocean from Zeebrugge, Belgium to Port Hueneme, California. The crane then required 120 tractor-trailers to transport it to Las Vegas. A separate crane was required to assemble the main crane, a process which took 18 days. In March 2020, construction reached the widest point of the sphere, the 516-foot equator, located at the sixth level and 108 feet above ground. MSG Sphere is expected to create 4,400 jobs upon opening. The project had been scheduled to open in 2021. However, on March 31, 2020, Madison Square Garden announced that construction would be suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project experienced a disruption in its supply chain, a result of the pandemic, and this hindered construction progress. All construction work on the project was expected to come to a stop over the next two weeks following the announcement. In August 2020, MSG Entertainment announced that construction had resumed on the project, with the opening rescheduled for 2023. Over the subsequent 15 months, construction would be focused on concrete, followed by steel erection and then the 13,000-ton steel-domed roof, the most complex part of the project. An identical MSG Sphere will be built in Stratford, East London and will open sometime after the MSG Sphere in Las Vegas. Features MSG Sphere will be 366 feet high, and 516 feet wide at its broadest point. It will include seating for 17,500 people, and all seats will have high speed internet access. The MSG Sphere will be equipped with 19,000 by 13,500 resolution LED screens which will spread across the interior of the venue. The wraparound screen will measure . Ted King, who previously worked on Star Trek: The Experience, will create visual content for the MSG Sphere. The sound system will deliver sound through the floorboards. The exterior of the venue will feature a screen display which will allow those who are outside of the venue to see what is going on inside.The MSG Sphere: The Future of Live Concert Experiences The arena will primarily host awards shows and concerts, in addition to other entertainment events. Although it was not designed to host sporting events, there was the possibility of hosting matches for boxing and mixed martial arts. A 1,000-foot pedestrian bridge will connect the sphere to the Sands Expo. Transit links The MSG Sphere will be accessible via RTC Transit and The Deuce. In addition, there are plans to build a new Las Vegas Monorail station to serve the MSG Sphere and The Venetian.Monorail station planned for MSG Sphere arena in Las Vegashttps://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/clark- county/msg-sphere-will-have-las-vegas-monorail-station-1555085/ See also *Ericsson Globe References External links * Official website Category:Buildings and structures in Paradise, Nevada Category:Indoor arenas in Las Vegas Category:Music venues in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Sports venues in Las Vegas Category:Boxing venues in Las Vegas Category:Las Vegas Strip Category:Indoor arenas under construction in the United States ","title":"MSG Sphere at The Venetian"},{"id":"58826320","text":"Cefai is a surname.

Development In 1946 the US Navy sanctioned development of the Rigel missile as a sub-launched supersonic weapon to attack enemy shores, in parallel with development of the subsonic SSM-N-8 Regulus. The SSM-N-6 was to be launched by means of 4 rocket boosters and a catapult, with two ramjets for the cruise mode of the flight. Several Rigel test articles were built to test the planned ramjet system for the Rigel missile. They had a single ramjet and a single rocket booster. Subsequently, scaled-down Flight Test Vehicles (FTVs) were built with a configuration similar to the full-scale missile, and the first FTV launch occurred in May 1950. Unfortunately, plans to build the SSM-N-6 missiles were cancelled because the failure of FTV flight tests, but also due to the fact that Rigel posed a problem for submariners by requiring a longer launch rail on submarines than the SSM-N-8 Regulus.

It is published weekly on Wednesdays and its estimated circulation is 5,000. The Selma Enterprise is edited by Jenny McGill.  History  The Selma Enterprise was established in 1888 by V.I. & L.M. Willis as the Fresno County Enterprise. In 1891, Selma Enterprise became a daily newspaper under the management of T.D. Calkins and H. K Farley. P.F. Adelsbach was the proprietor and editor of the Enterprise in 1911. Adelsbach was offered 10,000 in gold to start a liquor paper (a paper supporting saloons' interests) and offer which he refused. In 1912, Adelsbach was severely beaten by C.H. Brynelson for an editorial comment Adelsbach made about Brynelson. M.L. Atwater was editor of the paper in 1920. Lowell Pratt was owner of the paper from 1926 to 1947. In 1929, Pratt became co-owner of the paper, when it was consolidated with the Selma Irrigator, which was owned by Edward Byfield. The co-owners, Pratt and Byfield, also purchased the Parlier Progress in 1929 and the Fowler Ensign in the 1930s. While he was owner of the paper, Pratt also served as postmaster of Selma for some time. Pratt also gained national attention for articles he wrote criticizing a judge who Pratt thought handled a case with prejudice against Filipino defendants. He wrote that Japanese-Americans should be afforded the same rights as all American citizens, and that they should be safely returned to their homes from the internment camps where they were being held. Pratt sold the paper in 1947 and became the first director of public relations at San Jose State College (now San Jose State University). In 1984, Roy Brock, publisher of the Selma Enterprise won the Justus F. Craemer Newspaper Executive of the Year Award from the California Press Foundation. He had been publisher of the paper since 1968. Roy's son, James Brock, who was also a publisher of the Enterprise and Recorder, won the same award in 1999. James Brock sold the two papers to Pulitzer Inc. in 2000. J.

Hassan and Jadis According to Arab historians, Tasm and Jadis were from \\"the extinct Arab\\" tribes. Tasm was an ally of Saba'. Tasm took over Jadis. The king of Tasm's name was ‚ÄòImliq. He used to deflower the brides of Jadis before they get married. Later Imliq was assassinated by someone from the tribe of Jadis. A person called Riyah from Tasm ran to Yemen asking for help from their ally. At that time Tubba Asad Abu Malik-karib was the king of Yemen. He asked his son Hassan to help Tasm. Hassan al-Himyari prepared an army and went to fight Jadis. There was a woman in Jadis called Zarqaa al-Yamamah. She was able to see a person from a distance of three days. Riyah told Hassan about Zarqaa al-Yamamah. Hassan sent a spy to see the tribe of Jadis. While that spy was looking for the tribe of Jadis he stepped on a thorn. While he was trying to remove it, Zarqaa al-Yamamah noticed him and warned her tribe saying: \\"oh my people, I see a person on the mountain and I think he is a spy\\", the Jadisites asked her \\"what is he doing?\\" she said: \\"He is either eating something or looking for his shoes\\". The Jadisites didn't believe her. Riyah told Hassan to take palms and hide his army behind them and that this should be done at night. Hassan asked: \\"Can she see at night?\\" Riyah replied: \\"She sees better at night\\". Hassan ordered his army to hide behind palms, each one of them should hide behind a palm. The army of Hassan went in the morning to Jadis. Zarqaa al-Yamamah noticed the army of Hassan and told her people: \\"Oh people of Jadis, either the trees or the horses of Himyar are coming\\". The Jadisites didn't believe her. Hassan al-Himyari killed all of the men and women of Jadis and took the children as slaves. The army of Hassan brought al-Yamamah to him, he ordered that her eyes be taken out. They found black veins in her eyes. Hassan asked al-Yamamah: \\"What is this in your eyes?\\" she replied: \\"This a Kohl called al-Thmad\\". Hassan's death Hassan invaded northern areas in Arabia along with the Yemeni Aqayls () (leaders of the mini- kingdoms of Yemen). Hassan was irritable. He used to take all the goods from the wars for himself without sharing with the Aqyals. In a certain spot in the land of Iraq, the Aqyals refused to go with Hassan any further. They wanted to return to their homeland and families. The Aqyals of Yemen met with each other and decided to convince Hassan's brother, 'Amr, to kill Hassan. One of the Aqyals called Dhu Ra øyn al-Himyari didn't agree with the other Aqyals. According to Nashwan al-Himyari, Dhu Ra øyn was from a noble family in Himyar. The Aqyals told  øAmr to kill his brother and they will make him the king after his brother.  øAmr agreed with their plan. Dhu Ra øyn forbade  øAmr from killing his brother saying, \\"You are the ruling house of our kingdom; do not kill your brother and thereby dissolve the uniting bonds of our house\\".  øAmr rejected Dhu Ra øyn advice. Later Dhu Ra øyn wrote a poem in a piece of leaf and gave it to  øAmr. He asked  øAmr not to open it. Hassan heard that the Aqyals and his brother were conspiring against him. He recited to  øAmr, After a period of time, Hassan went for hunting. He returned to his house and fell asleep.  øAmr entered Hassan's room and took the sword and killed his brother.  øAmr returned to the Aqails who slew him out of fear lest they be kept at military service while assuring him, \\"No harm, no harm!\\", \\"Your dead one was the best of us and your living one is lord over us, while all of you are chiefs\\".  øAmr pulled all the Himyar army from Iraq and returned with the Aqyals back to Yemen. One Himyari poet said, After  øAmr returned to Yemen he was unable to sleep and suffered from permanent insomnia. He brought the physicians and the soothsayers and diviners who work by examining physiognomy and told them that he can't sleep. One of them replied, \\"By God, no man has ever killed his brother or a blood relation wrongfully, as you killed your brother, without losing his sleep and incurring sleeplessness.\\" After  øAmr heard that, he immediately called all of those Aqyals who urged him to kill his brother. He ordered the executioner to behead them all in the same room. The executioner was beheading them until he arrived at Dhu Ra øyn, Dhu Ra øyn asked  øAmr to open the letter he gave him.  øAmr opened the letter and saw the poem that Dhu Ra øyn wrote which says, After  øAmr finished reading the letter, Dhu Ra øyn said: \\"Didn't I ask you not to kill your brother?\\".  øAmr told the executioner not to execute Dhu Ra øyn.

Normally, the internal organs in the pelvic cavity, such as the urinary bladder, the ovaries, the uterus, and the large intestine, are separate from each other. As a result, they are able to move or slide as the body moves, and it is possible for a surgeon to reach between two organs, without cutting into them, during abdominal surgery. In this condition, they are attached together by internal scars or adhesions and cannot move freely or be separated without cutting.  Symptoms  Frozen pelvis can cause chronic pelvic pain. Because these internal organs are attached to each other, they cannot move normally. This results in pain whenever an improperly attached organ moves, including during bowel movements, urination, menstruation, and sexual intercourse. Involvement of any pelvic nerves can cause neuropathic pain. The symptoms vary according to which organs are attached, and how tightly they are attached.  Causes  Frozen pelvis is often caused by endometriosis. It can also be caused by cancer, such as late-stage ovarian cancers and rectal cancers. Abdominal actinomycosis can produce frozen pelvis in its later stages, especially after removal of an intrauterine contraceptive device. Infections (such as pelvic inflammatory disease), internal scars from abdominal surgery, non-cancerous growths, and internal scars from radiation therapy can also cause frozen pelvis. Genital tuberculosis is a relatively common cause of infertility in some countries, such as India, and can cause frozen pelvis.  Diagnosis  Frozen pelvis may be discovered during pelvic surgery. Sometimes, the results of a CT scan suggest frozen pelvis.  Classification  Frozen pelvis is sometimes classified into one of several patterns: ;Centrifugal :Typical of endometriosis ;Centripetal :Rarer, but more severe ;Left-frozen :Affecting primarily the left side, near the sigmoid colon ;Complete :All organs are attached together.  Outcomes  If undiagnosed and untreated, complications can include bowel obstruction, several kinds of hydronephrosis and other damage to the urinary tract, and damage to pelvic nerves. Frozen pelvis is difficult to manage if abdominal surgery is needed, because the anatomical landmarks, which surgeons use to locate and avoid delicate structures and nearby organs, are distorted or hidden behind adhesions. The surgeon may be unable to complete the surgery safely. With a frozen pelvis, the rate of reported surgical complications is 2% overall, and as high as 24% if the adhesions extend to the large intestine.

She is known for creating the comic persona of la peladita ‚ÄúLa Chata,‚Äù an underdog, fast-talking character that could survive and ironically come out ahead in any situation. Escalona formed and managed several successful vaudeville companies that performed in San Antonio, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and other cities in the United States, Cuba, and Mexico.  Early years  Escalona was born in San Antonio, Texas, on Medina Street, near the depot for the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Her father died when she was young, so she was raised by her mother, who started a business serving food to train passengers. Her first encounters with the theater took place during extended stays with relatives in Monterrey, Mexico. They lived near the Teatro Independencia, which was frequented by numerous traveling companies. According to scholar Tom√°s Ybarra-Frausto, Escalona \\"sat entranced through programs of drama, melodrama, zarzuela, and revista. [She] developed such an abiding passion for the stage that when funds were not available for admission, she created small bouquets of domestic flowers from her relatives' garden, selling them in order to buy the cheapest seats in the galer√≠a.\\" To continue her passion for theater back in San Antonio, and to help support her widowed mother, Escalona began working part-time as an usher at the Teatro Zaragosa. When she was sixteen, she moved to a better position at the Teatro Nacional in the downtown area. One of the headlining acts was a variety company called Los Hermanos Areu, and one of the brothers, Jos√©, fell in love with Escalona and the two were married. She was invited to join the troupe, and, under the tutelage of the brothers, trained as an actress, singer, dancer, and comedienne. In 1920, at the age of eighteen, she made her stage debut at the Teatro Col√≥n in El Paso, Texas.  Career   Early career  The Areu family was of Spanish-Cuban heritage, and they were an important troupe on the Spanish-language vaudeville and zarzuela circuit in the Southwest, touring Mexico and the Southwest throughout the 1920s. By 1930 Beatriz was known as ‚ÄúLa Chata Noloesca,‚Äù the comic underdog character she created, and she had separated from her husband and created her own vaudeville company, Atracciones Noloesca.  Compania Mexicana  In 1936, Escalona formed a new vaudeville company primarily made up of women from San Antonio, and in 1938 the Compania Mexicana began performing throughout the United States in cities where the Hispanic populations could support live theater. Escalona‚Äôs idea to was to bring Mexican variety acts to Latino communities, and the company had considerable success in Tampa, Miami, and Cuba. In 1941 following well-received performances in Chicago, the troupe went to New York, where they played various theaters and worked in radio and television.

Vicente peaked late on October 20 with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . At its peak, Vicente displayed a sporadic eye feature in its central dense overcast. The storm maintained this intensity for about eighteen hours as it turned towards the southwest. Dry air caused Vicente to weaken on October 21. A brief break from the dry air during the next day allowed the storm to recuperate and slightly strengthen. However, outflow from the nearby Hurricane Willa caused Vicente to weaken into a tropical depression early on October 23. After making landfall near Playa Azul at 13:30 UTC, Vicente quickly lost organization and dissipated a few hours later. Vicente caused torrential rainfall in the Mexican states of Michoac√°n, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Guerrero, and Colima; the highest total exceeded in Oaxaca. In some states, the effects of Vicente compounded those from the nearby Hurricane Willa. The storm left a total of 16 people dead throughout 2 states: 13 in Oaxaca and 3 in Veracruz. The heavy rainfall caused numerous rivers to spill their banks, dozens of landslides to occur, and severe flooding to ensue elsewhere. This resulted in hundreds of homes being inundated, dozens of road closures, and agricultural damage amongst an array of other effects. Plan DN-III-E was activated in multiple states to provide aid to affected individuals. The federal and state governments mobilized to help with relief efforts and repairs. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Vicente's origins can be traced back to a low-level vortex associated with the eastern Pacific monsoon trough and a tropical wave. The wave departed from Africa's western coast on October 6 and traveled westward across the Atlantic Ocean, arriving at the Lesser Antilles around October 14\\\\. Although convection or thunderstorm activity initially flared along the northern side of the wave, it gradually decreased until the wave was completely devoid of convection. The wave came into contact with Central America on October 16; deep convection re-ignited along the monsoon trough and wave south of Panama a day later. Bursts of convection occurred to the south of Nicaragua and El Salvador as the wave proceeded westward into the Eastern Pacific. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned that the system had the potential for tropical development early on October 19\\\\. The system was part of a broader disturbance which stretched from Central America to the south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Over the next several hours the system rapidly organized, becoming a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC, while located about 90 mi (150 km) west-southwest of Puerto San Jose, Guatemala. The depression's development was not anticipated due to its small size and the close proximity of a larger disturbance to the west (which later become Hurricane Willa). The nascent depression was located in an environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, both conducive for further intensification. The structure of the unusually small storm continued to improve, with satellite and microwave imagery showing an increase in banding features around the center. The depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Vicente around 18:00 UTC. Throughout the majority of October 19, the system was less than 115 mi (185 km) off the coast of Guatemala while it inched towards the northwest. alt=Satellite image of Tropical Depression Vicente just after making landfall in Michoac√°n, Mexico and Hurricane Willa located to the northwest on October 23. Early on October 20, increasing northwesterly wind shear disrupted Vicente, causing the degradation of its central dense overcast. At the same time, its low-level center had accelerated towards the northwest and was almost entirely exposed. A deep-layer ridge located over the Gulf of Mexico and central Mexico, as well as a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind, caused Vicente's track to shift to the west during the overnight. The tiny tropical cyclone's structure improved over the next several hours, with the storm displaying a sporadic eye feature surrounded by medium to weak convection. Vicente peaked at 18:00 UTC on October 20 with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of . At that time, the storm was located less than 115 mi (185 km) off the coast of Chiapas and Oaxaca, Mexico. Vicente was an unusually small tropical cyclone, with winds extending only 25 mi (35 km) from its center. The system maintained its peak intensity for approximately 18 hours as it began traveling towards the west- southwest. Dry air began to entrain into the mid-levels of the system on October 21, causing convection to weaken and the low-level center to become uncovered once more. The storm turned to the west-northwest early on October 22 as it rounded the southwestern edge of the aforementioned ridge. The structure of Vicente markedly improved while it experienced a brief reprieve from the onslaught of the dry air; a banding feature with cold cloud tops of developed and wrapped around a majority of the storm. Later in the day, Vicente began to be affected by the outflow of Hurricane Willa, which was located to the northwest. This outflow imparted northeasterly shear upon Vicente, causing rapid degradation of the system's structure. Banding features decreased significantly and only limited convection remained, displaced to the south and east of Vicente's center. Vicente weakened into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on October 23 and made landfall near Playa Azul, Michoac√°n at 13:30 UTC. After moving ashore, Vicente quickly lost its convection and dissipated by 18:00 UTC. Impact Despite Vicente's close proximity to land, no tropical storm watches or warnings were issued for Guatemala and Mexico. An overall green alert, signifying a low level of danger, was issued for southwestern coast of Mexico. The threats posed by both Vicente and Hurricane Willa forced the Norwegian Bliss cruise ship to divert to San Diego, California. Vicente caused torrential rainfall in multiple states. Peak rainfall of at least occurred in the state of Oaxaca. Rainfall totals of and were recorded in Zihuatanejo, Guerrero. In the same state, of rain fell in San Jeronimo. Rainfall exceeding registered in Colima state. Michoac√°n Vicente made landfall near Playa Azul, Michoac√°n at 13:30 UTC (08:30 CDT) on October 23. Schools along the coast of Michoac√°n were closed to safeguard everyone from the effects of Vicente and Willa. Rainfall from the storm flooded 27 neighborhoods in the city of Morelia. Ventura Puente, Carlos Salazar, Jacarandas, Los Manantiales, and Industrial experienced flooding up to deep, which left hundreds of homes inundated. Residents were evacuated from the Jacarandas neighborhood by state officials and police officers after rainfall caused a gasoline leak to occur. Five schools were closed in the city due to flooding and another for mud removal and disinfection work. The Rio Grande overflowed, and drainage systems were completely filled throughout the Morelia municipality. The heavy rainfall also caused the ground to give way near Atapaneo, resulting in a freight train derailment that left two workers injured. Plan DN-III-E, a disaster relief and rescue plan, was activated in the municipality; 500 individuals from the Police Training Institute were dispatched to help those affected by the flooding. Oaxaca The system brought heavy rainfall to Oaxaca, causing widespread flooding and mudslides. Torrential rainfall filled four Oaxacan dams to their highest levels in over four years; two of the dams exceeded 90% of their capacity and another exceeded 100%. The floods left 21 communities without any outside communication. Roads in Oaxaca suffered severe damage in 203 sections; machinery was apportioned to clear landslides off roads. At least 13 people died throughout the state, 6 of whom died in a landslide in San Pedro Ocotepec. A family of four went missing after trying to leave one of the communities. Rescue searches for the individuals ceased a week later; they were assumed to have been buried by a landslide. A landslide in Santiago Camotl√°n buried a house and killed a 40-year-old man. In Tututepec, a 56-year- old man drowned after getting caught in river currents. Multiple rivers in the state overtopped their banks and inundated nearby communities. A landslide in Santiago Choapam destroyed three homes. A drainage ditch emptying into the Chahu√© Bay overflowed, flooding at least 80 homes and businesses; a portion of the ditch also collapsed. Rainfall caused a sinkhole to develop on a bridge. A total of five cars were swept away by water currents flowing down streets in Santa Cruz Huatulco. As a result of the flooding, a temporary shelter was enabled in that area. National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples facilities were activated to help 30 people who were affected. The ports of Puerto √Ångel, Puerto Escondido, and Huatulco were closed. Several communities in the Sierra Norte region were isolated and left without any outside communication by landslides and damaged bridges. Crops in that area were destroyed by the storm, leading to food shortages. Vicente damaged schools, health care facilities, houses, and crops in the Sierra Mazateca area. In La Humedad, Mexican Federal Highway 200 was flooded for over and covered by landslides. A fence collapsed and several homes were inundated by floodwaters in Santiago Jamiltepec. Five families were evacuated from their homes in Piedra Ancha due to flooding. Emergency declarations were issued for 167 municipalities that were severely affected. The Mexican Army and Navy alongside State Police deployed 10,000 personnel to assist in recovery efforts. Plan DN-III-E was activated to disperse aid to the state; a Mexican Air Force helicopter was utilized to get food and supplies to people in affected areas. A disaster declaration was issued for 71 Oaxacan municipalities affected by Vicente; these areas would have access to national disaster relief funds. Veracruz Rainfall from the storm triggered flooding in Veracruz, leaving three people dead. A declaration of emergency was issued for 13 municipalities in Veracruz. The town of Tlacotalpan prepared for the overflow of the Papaloapan and Coatzacualcos rivers by creating levees to prevent floodwaters from affecting historical and cultural sites. Multiple landslides were reported on the Zomgolia-Orizaba highway. In the southern portion of the state, the Veracruz-Coatzacoalcos highway was blocked by floodwaters after the Tesochoac√°n river overflowed. Throughout the state, 21 landslides occurred, and 42 roads and 36 schools sustained damage. In the √Ålamo-temapache municipality, the Oro Verde stream and the Pantepec river overflowed, flooding multiple streets. Plan DN-III-E was enabled to aid with relief in the state. The San Juan river spilled its banks, completely blocking the Tinaja-Cosoleacaque highway, a road that connects other states to Veracruz. Federal Police stopped cars from crossing a section of the Cosamaloapan-Acayucan highway after the same river left of the road completely submerged under water. Additionally, 1,764 people were evacuated, 15 temporary shelters were activated, and 8 people were rescued throughout the state. Several communities were inundated in Hidalgotitl√°n after the Coatzacoalcos river overflowed; 790 homes were flooded in the towns of Ramos Mill√°n and Vicente Guerrero. Shelters were setup for affected families and 500 pantries distributed water. Classes in the area were canceled as a result of the floods. Twenty-one emergency declarations were authorized for municipalities in the state. Elsewhere A total of ten landslides occurred in the state of Hidalgo as a result of heavy rainfall from Vicente and the nearby Willa. In the municipalities of Huasteca and Sierra, highway accesses were blocked by boulders and tree limbs. Two people were hospitalized due to a landslide in Zacualtip√°n. Seven people were evacuated after a house was buried in Calnali. Roads in Huehuetla and Tenango del Valle were impassable due to landslides. Landslides affected the Tlanchinol-Hueyapa state highway in Tepehuac√°n de Guerrero, the Pachuca-Huejutla highway in the Mineral del Chico municipality, and on the Mexico-Tampico federal highway. The rains also filled several dams and reservoirs in the state to over 90% of their capacity, however, there was no risk of failure as a result of active spillways. Due to the unsettled weather produced by Vicente and the nearby Willa, numerous oil tankers were unable to unload fuel at ports in Manzanillo and Tuxpan. Combined with the closure of a major pipeline that transports petroleum to Guadalajara, this caused a fuel shortage in Jalisco, with some 500 gas stations being affected. Damage to gasoline distribution centers in Manzanillo and Tuxpan as well as a refinery in Salamanca led to shortages in Jalisco, Nayarit, and Colima. Heavy rainfall from Vicente and Willa caused a total of 24 landslides on highways in Jalisco, with about half occurring on El Tuito-Melaque-Cabo Corrientes section of Mexican Federal Highway 200. Agricultural losses in the state of Colima from Vicente and Willa were estimated to be about MX$136 million (US$7.05 million). The state of Guerrero also experienced the effects of Vicente. One home flooded in Tixtla de Guerrero and another in Tecpan; the latter's roof also collapsed. Mudslides were reported on two roads in the state. The state government activated over 500 shelters with enough capacity to house 100,000 people. The Tesechoac√°n, Papaloapan, and San Juan rivers began to overflow from heavy rainfall. The storm felled 16 trees in Zihuatanejo; sewers were congested with garbage, leading to street flooding in multiple places throughout the city.

Many of these regulations resulted from the Fifty-Sixth World Health Assembly in 2003, after which Latvia adopted the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). Latvia has higher prevalences of smoking tobacco in children and adults than many other European countries, where in 2014, it was reported that 37.6% of adults currently smoked tobacco (53.6% of all adult males and 22.3% of all adult females). These high prevalences also occur in children, where the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) in 2011 found that 40.5% of children in grades 7 through 9 reported current tobacco use, while 31.5% were smoking cigarettes. The percentage of children smoking tobacco decreased between the years of 2011 and 2014, where another GYTS survey indicated that 24.7% of youth from grades 7 through 9 regularly smoked tobacco.  Smoking Regulations  Currently, Latvia upholds the smoking standards set by the World Health Organization by following the FCTC MPOWER tobacco control methods. These measures include monitoring tobacco usage, protecting the public from passive smoking, offering the means to quit smoking, warning the public of the associated dangers, enforcing bans and regulations, and raising taxes on tobacco products. Multiple laws have been implemented in the last twenty years with these measures in mind that aim to address the dangers of smoking tobacco on an individual's health along with the health of those around them. An example of cigarette packaging warnings In 1995, the advertisement of tobacco products on radio and on television was prohibited. Four years later, the advertisement of tobacco products was only allowed in certain publications that were intended for tobacco merchants and producers, and packaging of tobacco products was required to adhere to certain images and to contain at least two warnings against the dangers of smoking tobacco. By 2005, it was entirely prohibited to smoke in schools and smoking in hospitals, restaurants, correctional facilities, workplaces, casinos, hotels, and other public spaces was prohibited unless within a designated smoking area. As of 2010, it is illegal to sell any smokeless tobacco products and to manufacture or sell cigarettes that exceed 1 mg of nicotine, and health warnings are required to cover approximately half of the surface area of all cigarette packs. In 2013, Latvia passed a by-law on the State Commission on Restriction of Smoking. This state institution was given the task of ensuring the citizens' rights to smoke-free air, by coordinating and submitting proposals on smoking prevention programs and tobacco product requirements.

It had its world premiere at the Chicago International Film Festival on October 13, 2018. It was released on January 18, 2019, by IFC Films. Plot National security expert Elizabeth \\"Libby\\" Lamm (Sumpter) is hired as an adjunct professor of foreign policy at the prestigious Grant University. She is the former national security adviser to U.S. Vice President Rachel Burke (Curtis). She arrives amid protests and the university employees are cold to her, including her assistant and another professor who confronts her at a university mixer. Dr. Lamm is recognizable due to a Capital Dispatch op-ed where she explains and defends her role in an attack by US forces, revealed later in the film to be a strike on Homs. Dr. Lamm is extra cautious about security, preferring to live her daily life without an email address, cell phone, landline or computer. Every night, she comes home to her study and writes feverishly on note pads at her desk. She has over a dozen of them completely filled and locks them in a vintage safe that she purchased from an antique shop. She walks around her home with a loaded Glock 17 and is always alerted to unfamiliar sounds. Dr. Lamm is being stalked by Martin Salhi (Ben Tavassoli), a graduate student at the university. Martin is withdrawn and sullen, and is intentionally standoffish from his roommate Jordan (Alex Weisman). Martin follows her home and later creates fake lawn service flyers as pretext to case her home. He breaks into her home and installs miniature cameras to observe her movements. He watches Dr. Lamm place the note pads in the safe. One day, Dr. Lamm is approached at her home by Adrian (Jeff Hephner), the president's chief of staff. It is revealed that they were lovers when he was a policy adviser in the White House. He wants assurances that she will not reveal details of the Homs operation but she rebuffs him. A few days later, Adrian returns, this time demanding fidelity to the administration. Dr. Lamm angrily refuses. This incident prompts her to dismiss her class and rush home where she finds Martin breaking into her safe. While holding him at gunpoint, Martin admits to stalking and states that he was trying to understand how someone who could commit such an enormous atrocity, referring to the attack on Homs. He tells her that his parents and siblings lived in Homs and that he wanted \\"to understand the face of evil.\\" Dr. Lamm then gives him the note pads she had been writing on to read. She is writing a memoir that she wants to be published that exposes the aggression behind the attack. Four years earlier, Dr. Lamm is in the White House situation room and advises on a plan with a high-security group including the president and vice-president. She tells the group that 5 leaders of the most dangerous terrorist groups in the world, plus a nuclear scientist, will be meeting in Homs, Syria to discuss strategy. Dr. Lamm favors more conventional action but she is interrupted by Vice President Burke who overwhelming endorses Plan 712. The plan involves a nuclear strike that will result in an extreme mass casualty loss. Dr. Lamm ultimately and reluctantly endorses the plan. The attack kills the intended targets as well as causing the deaths of 150,000 civilians. As Martin finishes reading, her home is broken into by undercover agents. Dr. Lamm and Martin escape and go on the run. Her intention is to take the memoir to her father Phillip Lamm (Clarke Peters), chief editor of the Springfield Register. They spend the night on the beach but Martin awakens to find Dr. Lamm gone, but the note pads were left with him. Dr. Lamm awakes in a basement and is approached by Adrian and current President Rachel Burke. President Burke tries to convince her to join her cabinet as Secretary of State in exchange for burying the memoir. Dr. Lamm realizes that the agents left the memoir with Martin and are surveilling him, hoping that he would lead them to more copies if there are any. She refuses President Burke's offer and is prepared to accept whatever consequences that come from its publication. The president leaves and tells Adrian to release Dr. Lamm and end the surveillance on Martin. She believes she will be exonerated by the public by asserting the years of domestic safety as proof of its success. Adrian objects, believing that by not neutralizing the two, it will be political suicide. The president disagrees and overrules him. Dr. Lamm is released across the street from the Springfield Register. She enters the lobby and sees Martin and her father there. Suddenly a bomb explodes and destroys the lobby. It is revealed that Adrian acted on his own. Twenty-three people are confirmed dead including Dr. Lamm, her father and Martin, with the attack being blamed on him. After the apartment they shared was searched by the FBI, Jordan opens an email from Martin that was sent earlier. It contains copies of the memoir and asks him to give it to the media to reveal the truth.

Holmgren's main botanical interests are the flora of the U.S. intermountain west and the genera Tiarella and Thlaspi. Holmgren was the director of the herbarium at the New York Botanical Garden from 1981‚Äì2000, and editor of Index Herbariorum from 1974‚Äì2008.  Life  Patricia May Kern was born to Robert Evan Kern (1919‚Äì2004) and Ruth Eleanor Beaudoin Kern (1921‚Äì1992) in 1940, in Athens, Indiana. Her parents began raising Christmas trees in 1946, and Holmgren spent part of her summers trimming trees and weekends in the fall and winter helping with the business. Holmgren was introduced to nature at an early age; through her father's conservation work on their property, and during family vacations to western national parks during the farm's off-season. From fifth grade to her high school graduation, Holmgren was active in 4-H, winning many contests in forestry and sewing. Holmgren attended high school at Rochester High School in Rochester, Indiana, graduating in 1958 as valedictorian. Holmgren attended Indiana University, getting a B.S. in 1962. She later attended the University of Washington, completing a M.S. in 1964 and a Ph.D. in 1968.Curriculum Vitae, Patricia K. Holmgren (2017). Folder Patricia Kern Holmgren, NYBG Vertical File, The LuEsther T. Mertz Library, The New York Botanical Garden. October 10, 2018. At the University of Washington, Holmgren completed a systematic study of Tiarella (Saxifragaceae) with advisor Arthur R. Kruckeberg. She remained at the University of Washington for her Ph.D., a systematic study of the Thlaspi montanum (Brassicaceae) group, with advisor C. Leo Hitchcock. In addition to her own research, Holmgren became chief editorial assistant during the preparation of the last two volumes of the Vascular Plants of the Pacific Northwest with Hitchcock. Patricia married fellow botanist Noel H. Holmgren (son of botanist Arthur H. Holmgren) in 1969.  Career  Patricia Holmgren (front) with fellow New York Botanical Garden herbarium staff (behind, L to R): Lois Brako, Barbara Thiers, Bill Buck, & Jim Grimes. After completing her Ph.D. at the University of Washington, Holmgren accepted a job as herbarium specialist at the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) in 1968. Holmgren spent her entire working career at NYBG, eventually becoming the Director of the Herbarium in 1981, a position she held until her retirement in 2000. As director of The William and Lynda Steere Herbarium, Holmgren insisted on the highest possible standards for specimen management and for keeping the herbarium in the forefront on new innovations (such as the creation of an online Index Herbariorum and development of the C.V. Starr Virtual Herbarium).
