At the beginning of 1902, Petar also became a freedom fighter, and in May 1902, he became a regional voyvoda for the Prilep region. Atanas Ivanov was then a member of his band. Petar Atsev was a representative of the Prilep revolutionary region at the Congress of Smilevo, where he was one of the principal antagonists to the idea of organizing and carrying out the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising. To explain his opposition to the Uprising, he emphasized the lack of armaments and ammunition in his revolutionary region.

In 1600 he was admitted as a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a ‚Äòwijnmeester‚Äô, i.e. the son of a member. The 17th-century Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie reported in his 1662 Het Gulden Cabinet that Pepijn visited Italy but there is no evidence of such trip. Crossing of the Red Sea He married on 1 December 1601 with Marie Huybrechts (her death debt was paid between 1647 and 1648) with whom he had five children: Willem, Adriaan, Marten, Martha and Katharina.Catharina Pepijn in\`; Franz Jozef Peter van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche Schilder-school, Part 1], Buschmann, 1883, p. 474-479 His daughter Katharina (1619‚Äì1668) became a notable portrait painter in the style of Rubens and van Dyck. A son also became a painter but nothing his known about his work. Although Cornelis de Bie and the early Dutch artist biographer Arnold Houbraken wrote that there was rivalry between Pepijn and Rubens, this is unlikely in view of the fact that Isabella Brant, Rubens' first wife, was the godmother of his eldest daughter Martha.Ursula H√§rting. \\"Pepyn, Maarten.\\" Grove Art Online.

This painting ended up in the 19th century in the collection of the Dutch king William II. Between 1602 and 1628 Maarten Pepijn took on eight apprentices. In addition to his own children, his pupils were Hans Caes, Claes Fopsen, Hans Bosken (all 1602), Matthieu Matthiesen (1613), Matthys Goossens (1620/21), Fran√ßois Lemmens (1620/21), Joris Sebil (1620/21) and Fran√ßois van Boost (1625/26 ). The wedding feast of Bacchus and Ariadne Marten Pepijn suffered of ill health at the end of his life and died in Antwerp in 1643. Work History painting Marten Pepijn was mainly known for his large religious compositions, and in particular, altarpieces. His style in these works is old-fashioned. The figures are generally depicted in stiff poses reminiscent of 16th-century sculpture. His work shows a distinctive influence by Ambrosius Francken the Elder, and as a result some of Francken's works have been attributed to Pepijn. This is for instance the case with the grisaille Saints John and Matthew of 1602, which is the exterior of the right wing of a tryptich painted by multiple Antwerp mastersThe other artists who worked on the tryptich included Otto van Veen, Simon de Vos and Ambrosius Francken the Elder, see: David Freedberg, Iconoclasm and painting in the revolt of the Netherlands, 1566-1609, Garland, 1 Jan 1988, p. 212 for the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp (Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp). This wing is now attributed to Ambrosius Francken the Elder by the Netherlands Institute for Art History.Attributed to Ambrosius Francken (I), De evangelisten Johannes en Matth√´us at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Pepijn‚Äôs work is further characterized by its excellent portraiture. This is demonstrated in the composition Saint Bernard and the Duke of Aquitaine (Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Valenciennes). Genre paintings Ball at the court There is still uncertainty as to whether a number of cabinet pictures that depict genre scenes, in particular of ball scenes at court, that are now attributed to Marten Pepijn are in fact by his hand. Some of these pictures bearing a monogram show a style, which is completely different from the large-scale, muscular religious works of Pepijn. These works are believed to have been produced in a period when Pepijn had close contact with the leading Anwerp painter Frans Francken the Younger. These small-scale compositions contain little figures with stereotyped faces and soft contours. This style is found in his allegories of the Five Senses (private collection), The ball and the Ball at the court (both in the Pushkin Museum, Moscow). This last composition is signed and dated 1604 and depicts an elegant dance party. The influence of early works by Hieronymus Francken the Elder and Frans Francken the Younger, who were both known for their depictions of similar scenes, is apparent. The difference between the styles of these smaller compositions and his larger, religious works has yet to be satisfactorily explained. Some historians have suggested that possibly the smaller works are the work of a family member such as a son or brother of Pepijn.

The major areas of concern are the boundaries of Congressional Districts, State Senators, State Representatives, and School Districts. Awkwardly divided electoral districts Presently in Utah the boundaries of the electoral districts (except those of the two US Senators) are often drawn at the will of the elected officials, without the balancing factor of an independent, neutral commission. Several cities and counties are awkwardly divided in sectors without any logical reason. For example, this is the case of Moab, Ogden, Park City, Summit County, Tooele County, and so on. This could be considered a case of gerrymandering, as even US Senator Bob Bennett has admitted. Current agenda The first goal of Fair Boundaries is to organize a petition with the purpose to gather the 95,000 signatures necessary to get the initiative admitted to the official ballot. These signatures must be gathered by April 2010, in time for the November 2010 elections.

He was named after his father, Mirche Atsev, who was a well-known voyvoda. He schooled himself in Prilep and then he worked as a shepherd. After Turks murdered his father, he joined the Hayduk's band of Kone Pavlov in 1885. However, in the next year, he was arrested and imprisoned in Solun. After having escaped from the prison, Atsev moved to Bulgaria. During his stay in Sofia, he was accused of involvement in the murder of Stefan Stambolov, as a result of which he was imprisoned for three years in the Black Mosque, (now Sveti Sedmochislenitsi Church). In Sofia, together with his brothers Petar and Georgi, he joined the revolutionary activity of the IMARO against the Turkish authorities. In 1899, Atsev entered with a revolutionary band into Ottomn Macedonia, in the region of Nevrokop. Later, he was a voyvoda in the region in Prilep. In 1901, on the way to the village of Ulanci, in the Tikve≈° region, his band was chased and crushed by a Turkish military detachment. Mirche Atsev died in this battle. The Yugoslav partisan Mirƒçe Acev was a nephew of Mirche Atsev, on his brothers' side.

Most were sent to labor camps in the Donbass (Donets or Donez basin) where 16% of them died.The Expulsion of 'German' Communities from Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War, Steffen Prauser and Arfon Rees, European University Institute, Florence. HEC No. 2004/1 p. 55 Poland In its shifted borders, post-war Poland comprised large territories that had a German-speaking majority and had been part of German states for centuries. Many ethnic Germans living in these areas were, prior to their expulsion from their home region, used for years as forced laborers in labor campsPhilipp Ther, Ana Siljak, \\"Redrawing nations: ethnic cleansing in East-Central Europe, 1944‚Äì1948\\" p.58 (google books) such as that run by Salomon Morel. Among these camps were Central Labor Camp Jaworzno, Central Labor Camp Potulice, ≈Åambinowice, Zgoda labor camp and others.These were former nazi concentration camps, that were used to imprison ethnic Germans as in Potulice: One Place different memories The law authorizing forced labor, Article 20 of the law on the exclusion of the enemy elements from society, also removed rights to Polish citizenship and all property owned. The many camps were used during the process of the expulsions for the sake of \\"rehabilitating\\" Reichs- or Volksdeutsche, to decide if they could stay or go, but in reality this was a program of slave labor.Ethnic Germans in Poland and the Czech Republic: A Comparative Evaluation p.9 Roughly 200,000 ethnic Germans died in the Soviet run concentration camps in Poland. Others were still amongst the rest of the population, but the Polish government had made several declarations that the German population should be exploited as forced labor, instructing a minimum of 60 hours work per week with no rights for breaks. The salaries were insufficient for survival, usually 25 or 50 percent of Polish salaries. Czechoslovakia The German-speaking population of the Sudetenland was, in the same case as Poland, expelled after the war. The expulsion was not indiscriminate, however, since as late as 1947, large numbers of skilled German workmen were still being detained.Herbert Hoover, Report, \\"German Agricultural and Food Requirements\\", February 26, 1947 p.4 Germans were forced to wear a white armband with the letter \\"N\\", for \\"Nƒõmec\\" signifying German in Czech to identify them (even German Jews had to wear it).Bernard Wasserstein, \\"Vanishing Diaspora: The Jews in Europe Since 1945\\" p.38, ( googlebooks) Czech Deputy Premier Petr Mare≈° has in the past, in vain, tried to arrange compensation for ethnic Germans who were forcibly resettled or used as forced labor after the war.CZECH DEPUTY PREMIER WANTS TO ASSESS POSSIBLE COMPENSATION TO EXPELLED GERMANS RFE/RL Newsline, 03-06-20. (accessed 2010-02-02) Eastern Germany Many Germans in what would become East Germany were forced by the Communist authorities to work in German uranium mines producing the majority of the raw material of the Soviet atomic bomb project. Beginning in the summer of 1946 the Soviets began explorations in the Erzgebirge, and sealing off the old radium hot springs by September of the same year. An initial workforce of four to five thousand was established, with another 20,000 called for by the end of the year. The work was dangerous and stressful and the Soviets made no effort to improve it; as a result the mines became filled with forced labor conscripts and has been compared to a death march and the Gulags of Kolyma. Quotas were repeatedly set and raised, and conscription took place without regard to health or work experience - mines became staffed with office workers, craftsmen and students with no mining experience. By 1948 workers were pulled away from factories and criminals from jails to staff the mines, as were POWs returning to Germany from the Soviet Union. Housing lagged behind the burgeoning workers (with many regions doubling in population between 1946 and 1951), worsening already difficult conditions. The mines were considered worse than a penal colony, but were controlled directly by Moscow and local governments were unable to help. When an extra 60,000 workers were called for in the summer of 1947, a wave of potential workers flooded into West Germany to avoid the mines including many citizens who would otherwise prefer to live in the communist East. Workers who began as volunteers were turned into forced laborers. In an effort to increase the number of laborers, women were increasingly recruited to the non-segregated mines, many of whom brought or were infected with venereal diseases, and were sexually exploited by the Russian guards. Workers who attempted to escape, whether conscripts or volunteers, were hunted down and returned to the mines. Eventually Germans would become more involved in the running of the mines, forming a joint company with Russia in 1956.

According to Simon MacKenzie, \\"callous self- interest and a desire for retribution played a role in the fate\\" of German prisoners, and he exemplifies by pointing out that sick or otherwise unfit prisoners were forcibly used for labor, and in France and the Low Countries this also included work such as highly dangerous mine-clearing; \\"by September 1945 it was estimated by the French authorities that two thousand prisoners were being maimed and killed each month in accidents.\\"S.

Some of the 740,000 German prisoners transferred in 1945 by the U.S. for forced labor in France came from the Rheinwiesenlager camps; these forced laborers were already very weak, many weighing barely 50 kg (110 lbs).ZDF.de - Zwischen Tod und Liebe (accessed 2009-12-12) On a documentary by Guido Knopp, \\"Die Gefangenen Folge 4\\", \\"...

Many of these were used as forced labor, as a form of \\"reparations\\".Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman, \\"After the Cataclysm: Postwar Indochina and the Reconstruction of Imperial Ideology\\" (1979) pp. 35‚Äì37 \\"In Britain there were some 400,000 German POWs. By Autumn 1944 they were being used for forced labor as a form of 'reparations'. repatriation began in September 1946 and continued until the summer of 1948, over three years after the German surrender. After the war, too, the POWs spent the harsh winter of 1945‚Äì1945 in tents in violation of the 1929 Geneva Convention. The POWs referred to themselves as 'slave labor', with some justice.\\" \\"The psychological state of the POW changed 'from the anxiety and hope of the first half of 1946 to the depression and nihilism of 1948,' according to Henry Faulk.\\"Eugene Davidsson, \\"The Trial of the Germans: An Account of the Twenty- Two Defendants Before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg\\", (1997) p. 518‚Äì519 \\"the Allies stated in 1943 their intention of using forced workers outside Germany after the war, and not only did they express the intention but they carried it out. Not only Russia made use of such labor. France was given hundreds of thousands of German prisoners of war captured by the Americans, and their physical condition became so bad that the American Army authorities themselves protested. In England and the United States, too, German prisoners of war were being put to work long after the surrender, and in Russia thousands of them worked until the mid-1950s.\\" The two main reasons for their internment were political re-education (Wilton Park), and for non- officers employment as agricultural and other labor. In 1946 a fifth of all agricultural work in the UK was performed by German prisoners. An emotional and public debate ensued in the UK, where words such as \\"slaves\\", \\"slave labor\\" and \\"forced labor\\" were increasingly used in the media and in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. In 1947 the Ministry of Agriculture argued against rapid repatriation of working German prisoners, since by then they made up 25 percent of the land workforce, and they wanted to use them also in 1948. Faced with political difficulties in using foreign labor, the Ministry of Agriculture offered a compromise solution, in which German prisoners who volunteered were to be allowed to remain in Britain as free men. Following disputes about how many former prisoners of war would be permitted to remain voluntarily in Britain and whether they would first have to return briefly to Germany before being allowed to officially migrate to Britain, by the end of 1947 about 250,000 of the prisoners of war were repatriated, and the last repatriations took place in November 1948. About 24,000 chose to remain voluntarily in Britain. Norway In Norway, the last available casualty record, from August 29, 1945, shows that by that time a total of 275 German soldiers had been killed while clearing mines, while an additional 392 had been maimed. German protests that forcing POWs to clear mines was against international law (per article 32 of the Geneva Conventions) were rejected with the assertion that the Germans were not POWs; they were disarmed forces who had surrendered unconditionally (\\"avv√¶pnede styrker som hadde overgitt seg betingelsesl√∏st\\"). Mine clearance reports received by the Allied Forces Headquarters state: June 21, 1945; 199 dead and 163 wounded Germans; 3 Norwegians and 4 British wounded. The last registration, from August 29, 1945, lists 392 wounded and 275 dead Germans. Mine clearance was then for unknown reasons halted for close to a year before recommencing under better conditions during June‚ÄìSeptember 1946. This time many volunteered thanks to good pay, and death rates were much lower, possibly thanks in part to a deal permitting them medical treatment at Norwegian hospitals.Jonas Tjersland, Tyske soldater brukt som mineryddere VG, 08-04-2006. United States The United States transferred prisoners for forced labor to both the UK and France (which received 740,000 from the US). For prisoners in the U.S. repatriation was also delayed for harvest reasons.Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman, \\"After the Cataclysm: Postwar Indochina and the Reconstruction of Imperial Ideology\\" (1979) pp. 35‚Äì37 \\"In the United States, as in Britain, prisoners were used for forced labor. Truman delayed repatriation for 60 days for POWs essential for the harvest. POWs performed 20 million man-days of work on army posts and 10 million for contract employers (farm work, lumber, industry etc). some were assigned to work at the Chemical Warfare Center at the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland.\\" Civilians aged 14‚Äì65 in the U.S. occupation zone of Germany were also registered for compulsory labor, under threat of prison and withdrawal of ration cards.Eugene Davidsson, \\"The Trial of the Germans: An Account of the Twenty-Two Defendants Before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg\\", (1997) p.518 \\"In 1946 General Clay ordered the registration in the American zone of Germany of all persons capable of work between the age of 14 to 65 for men and 15 to 50 for women. 'All persons incapable of work because of illness, disability, etc., must present to the labor office proof of incapacity. the labor office is empowered to direct compulsory labor when necessary.' Under Allied Control Law No. 3 of February 17, 1946, German males from fourteen to sixty five and women from fifteen to fifty were subject to compulsory labor; the penalty for disobedience was imprisonment and having their ration cards taken away, a penalty that the International Military Tribunal declared inhuman when it was inflicted by the Germans.\\" Conclusion Most captives of the Americans and the British were released by the end of 1948, and most of those in French captivity were released by the end of 1949. According to the Office of Public Administration (part of Federal Ministry of the Interior), compensation for Germans used as forced labor after the war cannot be claimed in Germany since September 29, 1978, due to the statute of limitations.Zwangsarbeit als Minenr√§umer\\"Rudi war total durchl√∂chert\\", SPIEGEL (accessed 2009-12-20) See also *American food policy in occupied Germany *Forced labor in Germany during World War II *Foundation \\"Remembrance, Responsibility and Future\\" *Industrial plans for Germany *Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany *Unfree labor References Further reading *Michael Foley, \\"Prisoners of the British\\", 2009 *Sullivan, Matthew Barry, \\"Thresholds of Peace.

Allied troops committed a number of rapes during the Battle of Okinawa during the last months of the Pacific War and the subsequent occupation of Japan. The Allies occupied Japan until 1952 following the end of World War II and Okinawa Prefecture remained under US governance for two decades after. Estimates of the incidence of sexual violence by Allied occupation personnel differ considerably. Background By 1945 U.S. troops were entering and occupying territory with a Japanese civilian population. On February 19, 1945, U.S. troops landed on Iwo Jima, and on April 1, 1945, on Okinawa. In August 1945, Japan surrendered and Allied occupation troops landed on the main islands, starting the formal occupation of Japan. The Allied occupation ended in most of Japan on April 28, 1952, but did not end in Okinawa until May 15, 1972, when the terms of the Treaty of San Francisco went into effect. During the Pacific War the Japanese Government frequently issued propaganda claiming that if the country was defeated Japanese women would be raped and murdered by Allied soldiers. The government used this claim to justify orders to soldiers and civilians in areas which were invaded by Allied forces to fight to the death or commit suicide. Battle of Okinawa According to Calvin Sims of The New York Times: \\"Much has been written and debated about atrocities that Okinawans suffered at the hands of both the Americans and Japanese in one of the deadliest battles of the war. More than 200,000 soldiers and civilians, including one-third of the population of Okinawa, were killed\\". U.S. military rapes There is no documentary evidence that mass rape was committed by Allied troops during the Pacific War. There are, however, numerous credible testimony accounts which allege that a large number of rapes were committed by U.S. forces during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. Okinawan historian Oshiro Masayasu (former director of the Okinawa Prefectural Historical Archives) writes: According to Toshiyuki Tanaka, 76 cases of rape or rape-murder were reported during the first five years of the American occupation of Okinawa. However, he asserts this is probably not the true figure, as most cases were unreported. Peter Schrijvers finds it remarkable that looking Asian was enough to be in danger of rape by American soldiers, as for example happened to some of the Korean comfort women that the Japanese had by force brought to the island. Schrijvers writes that \\"many women\\" were brutally violated with \\"not even the least mercy\\". Although Japanese reports of rape were largely ignored at the time due to lack of records, as many as 10,000 Okinawan women may have been raped according to a estimates from one Okinawan historian.. It has been claimed that the rape was so prevalent that most Okinawans over age 65 around the year 2000 either knew or had heard of a woman who was raped in the aftermath of the war. Military officials denied the mass rapings, and all surviving veterans refused the New York Times' request for an interview. Professor of East Asian Studies and expert on Okinawa Steve Rabson said: \\"I have read many accounts of such rapes in Okinawan newspapers and books, but few people know about them or are willing to talk about them\\". Books, diaries, articles and other documents refer to rapes by American soldiers of various races and backgrounds. Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor, supports this: \\"There is a lot of historical amnesia out there, many people don't want to acknowledge what really happened\\". An explanation given for why the US military has no record of any rapes is that few ‚Äì if any ‚Äì Okinawan women reported abuse, mostly out of fear and embarrassment. Those who did report them are believed by historians to have been ignored by the U.S. military police. A large scale effort to determine the extent of such crimes has also never been called for. Over five decades after the war has ended the women who were believed to have been raped still refused to give a public statement, with friends, local historians and university professors who had spoken with the women instead saying they preferred not to discuss it publicly. According to a Nago, Okinawan police spokesman: \\"Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public\\". In his book Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb, George Feifer noted that by 1946 there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of rape in Okinawa. He explains that it was: \\"partly because of shame and disgrace, partly because Americans were victors and occupiers\\". Feifer claimed: \\"In all there were probably thousands of incidents, but the victims' silence kept rape another dirty secret of the campaign\\". Many people wondered why it never came to light after the inevitable American-Okinawan babies the many women must have had. In interviews, historians and Okinawan elders said that some Okinawan women who were raped did give birth to biracial children, but that many of them were immediately killed or left behind out of shame, disgust or fearful trauma. More often, however, rape victims underwent crude abortions with the help of village midwives. According to George Feifer the majority of the likely thousands of rapes were committed in the north, where the campaign was easier and the American troops were not as exhausted as in the south. According to Feifer it was mostly troops landed for occupation duty who committed rapes. Katsuyama killing incident According to interviews carried out by The New York Times and published by them in 2000, multiple elderly people from an Okinawan village confessed that after the United States had won the Battle of Okinawa three armed African American Marines kept coming to the village every week to force the villagers to gather all the local women, who were then carried off into the hills and raped. The article goes deeper into the matter and claims that the villagers' tale ‚Äì true or not ‚Äì is part of a \\"dark, long- kept secret\\" the unraveling of which \\"refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war\\": \\"the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen\\".\\"Still, the villagers' tale of a dark, long-kept secret has refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war, the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen\\" . When the Marines started to confidently carry out their weekly ritual unarmed, the villagers reportedly overwhelmed the men and killed them. Their bodies were hidden in the nearby cave out of fear for retaliation against the village, a village secret until 1997. Since the killings, the cave has been known as Kurombo Gama, which is translated either as \\"Cave of The Negros\\" or, less commonly, \\"Niggers' Cave\\".Okinawa legend leaves unsettling questions about Marines' deaths, Locals call it Kuronb≈ç Gama. Gama means cave. Kurombo ÔºàÈªí„Çì„ÅºÔºâ is an ethnic slur referring to black people. Silence about rape Almost all rape victims were silent about what had happened to them, which helped to keep the rapes a \\"dirty secret\\" of the Okinawa campaign. The main reasons for the women's silence and the low number of reported rapes was, according to George Feifer, the American role as victor and occupiers, and feelings of shame and disgrace. According to Feifer, while there were probably thousands of rapes, fewer than 10 rapes were formally reported by 1946 and almost all of those were connected to \\"severe bodily harm\\". Several factors contributed to few telltale American rape- induced pregnancies coming to term; many women had become temporarily infertile due to the stress and malnutrition, and some who did become pregnant managed to abort before their husbands returned. Japanese Army rapes According to Thomas Huber from the Combat Studies Institute, Japanese soldiers also mistreated Okinawan civilians during the battle there. Huber writes that rape was \\"freely committed\\" by Japanese soldiers who knew that they had little chance of surviving due to the Army's prohibitions against surrender. These abuses contributed to a post-war divide between Okinawans and mainland Japanese. Official American policy and Japanese civilian expectations Having historically been a separate nation until 1879, Okinawan language and culture differ in many ways from that of mainland Japan, where they often were discriminated against and treated in the same manner as Chinese and Koreans. In 1944 heavy American air-bombings of Naha had left 1,000 dead and 50,000 homeless and sheltering in caves, and US naval bombardments contributed additionally to the death toll. During the Battle of Okinawa between 40,000 and 150,000 residents died. The survivors were put in internment camps by Americans. During the fighting some Japanese troops mistreated Okinawan civilians, for example taking over the caves they sheltered in and forcing them out into the open, as well as killing some directly who they suspected of being American spies. During the last months of desperate fighting they were also unable to supply the Okinawan population with food and medicine. Japanese propaganda about American atrocities had led many Okinawan civilians to believe that when the Americans came they would first rape all the women and then kill them. At least 700 civilians committed suicide. American soldiers did sometimes deliberately kill Okinawan civilians, though American official policy was to not kill them. The Americans also provided food and medicine, something the Japanese had been unable to do. In view of the propaganda claiming that American policy would be rape, torture and murder, the Okinawans were often surprised at \\"the comparatively humane treatment\\". Over time, Okinawans would become increasingly despondent with the Americans, but at the time of surrender the American soldiers were less vicious than had been expected. Post-war Public fear and Recreation and Amusement Association In the period after the Emperor of Japan announced that Japan would surrender, many Japanese civilians feared that Allied occupation troops were likely to rape Japanese women when they arrived. These fears were, to a large part, driven by concerns that the Allied troops would exhibit similar behavior to that of Japanese occupation forces in China and the Pacific. The Japanese Government and the governments of several prefectures issued warnings recommending that women take measures to avoid contact with occupation troops, such as staying in their homes and staying with Japanese men. Police in Kanagawa Prefecture, where the Americans were expected to first land, recommended that young women and girls evacuate the area. Several prefectural authorities also suggested that women kill themselves if they were threatened with rape or raped and called for \\"moral and spiritual education\\" to enforce this view. In response, the Japanese government established the Recreation and Amusement Association (RAA), military brothels to cater to the Allied troops upon their arrival, though most professional prostitutes were unwilling to have sex with Americans due to the impact of wartime propaganda. Some of the women who volunteered to work in these brothels claimed that they did so as they felt they had a duty to protect other women from Allied troops. These officially sponsored brothels were ordered closed in January 1946 when the Occupation authorities banned all \\"public\\" prostitution while declaring that it was undemocratic and violated the human rights of the women involved. The closure of the brothels took effect a few months later, and it was in private acknowledged that the main reason for closing down the brothels was the huge increase in venereal diseases among the soldiers. Rapes by U.S. forces Incidence Robert L. Eichelberger recorded his troops' suppression of the Japanese vigilante guard. Assessments of the incidence of rape by American occupation personnel differ. John W. Dower has written that while the R.A.A. was in place \\"the incidence of rape remained relatively low given the huge size of the occupation force\\". Dower has written that the incidence of rape increased after the closure of the brothels, possibly eight-fold, and According to one calculation the number of rapes and assaults on Japanese women amounted to around 40 daily while the R.A.A was in operation, and then rose to an average of 330 a day after it was terminated in early 1946\\". According to Dower, \\"more than a few incidents\\" of assault and rape were never reported to the police. Buruma states that while it is likely that more than 40 rapes took place each day, \\"most Japanese would have recognized that the Americans were far more disciplined than they had feared, especially in comparison to the behaviour of their own troops abroad\\". According to Ter√®se Svoboda \\"the number of reported rapes soared\\" after the closure of the brothels, and she takes this as evidence that the Japanese had been successful in suppressing incidents of rape by providing prostitutes to the soldiers. Svoboda gives one example where R.A.A. facilities were active but some not yet ready to open and \\"hundreds of American soldiers broke into two of their facilities and raped all the women\\". In contrast, Brian Walsh states that while the American occupation forces had a criminal element and many rapes occurred, \\"there is no credible evidence of the mass rape of Japanese women by American soldiers during the occupation\\", and claims that this occurred are not supported by the available documentation. Instead, he writes that both Japanese and American records demonstrate that rapes were uncommon, and the incidence was no greater than that in modern American cities. Walsh states that there were 1,100 reported cases of sexual violence by Allied troops throughout the occupation period, though this figure likely understates the actual incidence given that many rapes are never reported. Walsh has noted that the estimates given by Dower and several others would mean that \\"the U.S. Occupation of Japan would have been one of the worst occurrences of mass sexual violence in the history of the world\\", something which is not supported by the documentary evidence. Similarly, Michael S. Molasky, Japanese literature, language and jazz researcher, states in his study of Japanese post-war novels and other pulp literature, that while rape and other violent crime was widespread in naval ports like Yokosuka and Yokohama during the first few weeks of occupation, according to Japanese police reports, the number of incidents declined shortly after and were not common on mainland Japan throughout the rest of occupation. Incidents Some historians state that mass rapes took place during the initial phase of the occupation. For instance, Fujime Yuki has stated that 3,500 rapes occurred in the first month after American troops landed. Tanaka relates that in Yokohama, the capital of the prefecture, there were 119 known rapes in September 1945. At least seven academic books and many other works state that there were 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of Kanagawa Prefecture. Walsh states that this figure originated from Yuki Tanaka's book Hidden Horrors, and resulted from that author misreading the crime figures in their source. The source states that the Japanese Government recorded 1,326 criminal incidents of all types involving American forces, of which an unspecified number were rapes. Historians Eiji Takemae and Robert Ricketts state that \\"When US paratroopers landed in Sapporo, an orgy of looting, sexual violence and drunken brawling ensued. Gang rapes and other sex atrocities were not infrequent\\" and some of the rape victims committed suicide. In contrast, Walsh states that while there was a \\"brief crime wave\\" during the early phase of the occupation, \\"there was, relatively speaking, little rape\\" during this period. According to Svoboda there are two large events of mass rape recorded by Yuki Tanaka at the time that the R.A.A. brothels were closed down in 1946. *According to Tanaka, close to midnight on April 4, an estimated 50 GIs arriving in 3 trucks assaulted the Nakamura Hospital in Omori district. Attacking at the blow of a whistle, over the period of one hour they raped more than 40 patients and an estimated 37 female staff. One of the raped women had a two-day-old baby that was killed by being thrown on the floor, and also some male patients who tried to protect the women were killed. *According to Tanaka, on April 11, between 30 and 60 U.S. soldiers cut phone lines to a housing block in Nagoya city, and simultaneously raped \\"many girls and women between the ages of 10 and 55 years\\". General Robert L. Eichelberger, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, recorded that in the one instance when the Japanese formed a self-help vigilante guard to protect women from off-duty GIs, the Eighth Army ordered armoured vehicles in battle array into the streets and arrested the leaders, and the leaders received long prison terms. Rapes by British Commonwealth Occupation Force Australian, British, Indian and New Zealand troops in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) also committed rapes. The commander of the BCOF's official reports state that members of the BCOF were convicted of committing 57 rapes in the period May 1946 to December 1947 and a further 23 between January 1948 and September 1951. No official statistics on the incidence of serious crimes during the BCOF's first three months in Japan (February to April 1946) are available. Australian historian Robin Gerster contends that while the official statistics underestimate the level of serious crime among BCOF members, Japanese police often did not pass reports they received on to the BCOF and that the serious crimes which were reported were properly investigated by BCOF military police. The penalties given to members of the BCOF convicted of serious crimes were \\"not severe\\", however, and those imposed on Australians were often mitigated or quashed by Australian courts. According to Takemae and Ricketts: Allan Clifton, an Australian officer who acted as interpreter and criminal investigator wrote As to Australian justice Clifton writes regarding another rape that was witnessed by a party of card-players: Allied censorship of Japanese media American Occupation authorities imposed wide-ranging censorship on the Japanese media from 10 September 1945 until the end of the occupation in 1952, including bans on covering sensitive social issues and serious crimes committed by members of the Occupation forces. According to Eiji Takemae and Robert Ricketts, Allied Occupation forces suppressed news of criminal activities such as rape; on September 10, 1945, SCAP \\"issued press and pre-censorship codes outlawing the publication of all reports and statistics 'inimical to the objectives of the Occupation'\\". According to Teresa Svoboda the Japanese press reported cases of rape and looting two weeks into the occupation, to which the Occupation administration responded by \\"promptly censoring all media\\". However, Walsh states that the press reported few cases of rapes before the censorship began. For instance, the final article which included any discussion of rapes by Allied forces in the Asahi Shimbun (published on 11 September 1945) stated that none had taken place. Following the occupation Japanese magazines published accounts of rapes committed by American servicemen.

American food policy in occupied Germany refers to the food supply policies enacted by the U.S., and to some extent its dependent Allies, in the western occupation zones of Germany in the first two years of the ten-year postwar occupation of Western Germany following World War II. Background Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the German government instituted rationing which resulted in the restricted availability of food. Occasional shortages of food occurred during the war; thus, a black market developed. However, supplies were generally adequate, especially in comparison to the situation in some other European countries. This was in part due to the ruthless exploitation of occupied countries by the German government, Enssle (1987), p. 482 which utilized policies such as the \\"Hunger Plan\\", which resulted in the deaths of millions of people in German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union when food supplies were redirected to Germany and the German military units operating in the USSR,Collingham (2012), pp. 216‚Äì218 and the German blockade which resulted in the Dutch famine of 1944‚Äì45. Inadequate food rations also formed part of the Holocaust, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths in Warsaw alone,Collingham (2012), p. 207 and around two million Soviet prisoners of war were starved to death by German forces over the winter of 1941/42.Collingham (2012), p. 194 Widespread food shortages first began to occur in Germany following the end of the war in May 1945.Collingham (2012), p. 467 The production of food was disrupted by the effects of the war, including the destruction of farmland, livestock, and machinery. In addition, labor shortages developed when slave laborers who had been forced to work on German farms returned to their homes. The situation was worsened by a period of poor weather.Buruma (2013), p. 63 As a result, the output of German farms was sufficient to provide city residents with only 1,000 calories of nutrition per day. At this time, food supplies were limited across much of Europe, including the United Kingdom and France, resulting in continued rationing.Buruma (2013), p. 64 Planning for the occupation of Germany During the planning for the occupation of Germany, the Allies were faced with the issue of whether food allocations for the country should be set at either the minimum needed to avoid disease and political disorder, or levels sufficient to fully meet the population's needs. A principle of ensuring that Germans had no better access to food than the worst-affected Allied country was adopted, but not applied in practice. The Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force initially set the ration scale for Germans at 2,600 calories per day, the same as levels in Belgium and France and at the top of the scale considered adequate by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Once the occupation of Germany commenced, it proved impossible to deliver the intended levels of food. The Allied planners underestimated the extent of the damage to German infrastructure, and overestimated the ability of Germans to grow their own food. As a result, once supplies which had been stockpiled by the German government during the war ran out, the ration scales were reduced to 1,000 to 1,250 calories per day. Most German civilians were able to supplement these rations, however. Displaced persons, including Holocaust survivors, were allocated more generous rations. These averaged only between 1,600 and 2,000 calories per day, and few of the displaced persons were able to access other sources of food. Captured German soldiers After the German surrender, the U.S. chose to designate large numbers of German prisoners as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEF) instead of using the Prisoner of War status, under which the captives would have been under the protection of the Geneva conventionS. P. MacKenzie The Treatment of Prisoners of War in World War II, The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 66, No. 3. (Sep., 1994), pp. 487‚Äì520. and, therefore, would have been entitled to the same quantities of food as U.S. troops.Note: S. P. MacKenzie ...(ICRC) requested assurances from the belligerents that they intended to abide by the terms of the 1929 Geneva Convention. For these states to do so, however, would involve maintaining adequate standards regarding food, shelter, labor, and hygiene ‚Äì all roughly equal to those granted rear-area troops. The conditions these prisoners had to endure were often harsh. A number of the camps in Western Germany, especially initially, were huge wired-in enclosures lacking sufficient shelter and other necessities. (see Rheinwiesenlager) Since there was no longer a danger of German retaliation against Allied POWs, \\"less effort was put into finding ways of procuring scarce food and shelter than would otherwise have been the case, and, consequently, tens of thousands of prisoners died from hunger and disease who might have been saved\\". The International Red Cross was never permitted to fully involve itself in the situation in DEF or SEP camps; even though conditions in them gradually improved, even the most conservative estimates put the death toll in French camps alone at over 16,500 in 1945. After the German surrender, the International Red Cross was prohibited from providing aid such as food or visiting the prisoner camps. However, after making approaches to the Allies in the fall of 1945, it was allowed to investigate the camps in the UK and French occupation zones of Germany, respectively, as well as to provide relief to the prisoners held there. On February 4, 1946, the Red Cross was permitted to visit and assist prisoners also in the U.S. occupation zone of Germany, although only with very small quantities of food. During their visits, the delegates observed that German prisoners of war were often detained in appalling conditions. They drew the attention of the authorities to this fact, and gradually succeeded in getting some improvements made.  German civilian population  The German Red Cross, which during the war had become thoroughly Nazified with its head Ernst Grawitz a major figure in medical experiments on Jews and \\"enemies of the state\\",The humanitarians: the International Committee of the Red Cross, page 45, David P. Forsythe, Cambridge University Press was dissolved, and the International Red Cross and the few other allowed international relief agencies were kept from helping Germans through strict controls on supplies and on travel.Richard Dominic Wiggers pg. 281‚Äì82 During 1945 it was estimated that the average German civilian in the U.S. and the United Kingdom occupation zones received 1,200 calories a day.Richard Dominic Wiggers pg. 280 Meanwhile, non-German Displaced Persons were receiving 2,300 calories through emergency food imports and Red Cross help.Richard Dominic Wiggers pg. 279 Fearing a Nazi uprising, U.S. occupation forces were under strict orders not to share their food with the German population; these orders also applied to their wives when they arrived later in the occupation. The women were under orders not to allow their German maids to get hold of any leftovers; \\"the food was to be destroyed or made inedible\\", although in view of the starving German population facing them many housewives chose to disregard these official orders.Eugene Davidson, The Death and Life of Germany, p.85, University of Missouri Press, 1999, Nevertheless, according to a U.S. intelligence survey a German university professor reportedly said: \\"Your soldiers are good-natured, good ambassadors; but they create unnecessary ill will to pour of leftover cocoa in the gutter when it is badly needed in our clinics. It makes it hard for me to defend American democracy among my countrymen.\\"Eugene Davidson, The Death and Life of Germany, p.86, University of Missouri Press, 1999, In early 1946, U.S. President Harry S. Truman allowed foreign relief organizations to enter Germany in order to review the food situation. In mid-1946, non-German relief organizations were permitted to help starving German children.Richard Dominic Wiggers pg. 282 The German food situation became worst during the very cold winter of 1946‚Äì47, when German calorie intake ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day, a situation made worse by severe lack of fuel for heating.Richard Dominic Wiggers p. 244 Average adult calorie intake in the U.S was 3,200‚Äì3,300, in the UK 2,900 and in the U.S. Army 4,000.Richard Dominic Wiggers p. 285 The precise effect of the food crisis on German health and mortality has been a matter of some contention. Speaking of the Anglo-American zones, Herbert Hoover reported that in the fall of 1946, starvation produced a 40 percent increase in mortality among Germans over 70.The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria, No. 1, pg. 8 However, John Farquharson cites statistics indicating that the incidence of hunger-induced edema was low in 1946‚Äì1947. According to the British Medical Journal, mortality in the British zone was above its pre-war level until June, 1946, when the death rate fell below that of 1938.British Medical Journal, November 30, 1946. Also, once it became clear there would be no rising, as threatened by the Nazis during the war, food controls were relaxed. The historian Nicholas Balabkins notes that the Allied restrictions placed on German steel production, and their control over where the produced coal and steel was delivered, meant that offers by Western European nations to trade food for desperately needed German coal and machinery were rejected. Neither the Italians nor the Dutch could sell the vegetables that they had previously sold in Germany, with the consequence that the Dutch had to destroy considerable proportions of their crop. Denmark offered 150 tons of lard a month; Turkey offered hazelnuts; Norway offered fish and fish oil; Sweden offered considerable amounts of fats. The Allies were however unwilling to let the Germans trade.Nicholas Balabkins, Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945‚Äì1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 125 Another consequence of the Allied policy of \\"Industrial Disarmament\\" (see The industrial plans for Germany) was that there was a drastic fall in fertilizer available for German agriculture, thus further decreasing foodstuff production capacity.Nicholas Balabkins, Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945‚Äì1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 91 The German infant mortality rate was twice that of other nations in Western Europe until the close of 1948.Richard Dominic Wiggers pg. 286 The adequate feeding of the German population in occupied Germany was an Allied legal obligationNicholas Balabkins, Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945‚Äì1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 101Richard Dominic Wiggers p. 274 under Article 43 of The 1907 Hague Rules of Land Warfare.Richard Dominic Wiggers p. 279. \\"In postwar Germany and Japan, the U.S. Army financed the most urgent food imports by citing obligations under Article 43 of The Hague Rules of Land Warfare.\\"  JCS 1067  The \\"Handbook for Military Government in Germany,\\" an occupation document which advocated a quick restoration of normal life for the German people and reconstruction of Germany, was ready in August 1944. The secretary of the U.S. Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., author of the Morgenthau Plan for partition and deindustrialization of postwar Germany, brought it to the attention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt who after reading it accepted it enthusiastically with the words: > Too many people here and in England hold the view that the German people as > a whole are not responsible for what has taken place ‚Äì that only a few Nazis > are responsible. That unfortunately is not based on fact. The German people > must have it driven home to them that the whole nation has been engaged in a > lawless conspiracy against the decencies of modern civilization. However, after opposition from some members of the US government, a revised document was drafted, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directive 1067 (JCS 1067). Here the military government of occupation was ordered to \\"...take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany [or] designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy\\" and it was also ordered that starvation, disease and civil unrest were to be kept below such levels where they would pose a danger to the troops of occupation. On March 20, 1945, President Roosevelt was warned that the JCS 1067 was not severe enough: it would let the Germans \\"stew in their own juice\\". Roosevelt's response was \\"Let them have soup kitchens! Let their economy sink!\\" Asked if he wanted the German people to starve, he replied, \\"Why not?\\"Michael R. Beschloss, The Conquerors: Roosevelt, Truman and the Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1941‚Äî1945, pg. 196. By August 1945 General Clay was becoming increasingly concerned about the humanitarian and political situation in the area under his responsibility. He stated \\"There is no choice between being a communist on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on 1000 calories\\". Two years later, in July 1947, JCS 1067 was scrapped and replaced by JCS 1779 which noted that \\"an orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\\" Pas de Pagaille! Time Magazine, July 28, 1947. General Clay would later remark in his memoirs that \\"there was no doubt that JCS 1067 contemplated the Carthaginian peace which dominated our operations in Germany during the early months of occupation.\\"A Nation at War in an Era of Strategic Change, p.129 (Google Books) Consequences Nicholas Balabkins takes a favorable view of Allied policy, asserting that American food shipments saved the lives of \\"millions of Germans\\", although shortages persisted into 1948.Balabkins,Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament, pp. 100‚Äì103 Balabkins also notes that some distributed food rations were of poor composition and \\"considerably below minimum nutrition standards\\"; without access to additional food from alternative sources recipients would eventually fall prey to starvation.Balabkins,Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament, pp. 102,107,108 Balabkins also cites an authority who stated that the rations \\"represented a fairly rapid starvation level\\", showing the need for the supplemental rations that were provided Balabkins,Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament, p.107Note to the previous reference: Specified in footnote as the Testimony in the 1947 Hearings of the House Committee on Appropriations by Dennis A.

Year long celebrations ... Spiritual life At the age of 13, Nemichand decided to spend the rest of his life as a Jain sant. His diksha (consecration) took place on 7 December 1913 (Margashirsha Shukla Navami) at Miri in Ahmednagar district. He was then given the name Anand Rishi Ji Maharaj. He started learning Sanskrit and Prakrit Stotras under the guidance of Pandit Rajdhari Tripathi. He gave his first pravachan to the public in 1920 at Ahmednagar. Together with Ratna Rishi Ji Maharaj, Anand Rishi Ji had started promoting Jainism. After mentor Ratna Rishi Ji Maharaj's santhara death in Alipur in 1927, Anand Rishi Ji was devastated. However, he never forgot his mentors words \\"Never be sad, and always work towards well-being of mankind\\". His first chaturmas without his mentor was in Hinganghat in 1927. In 1931, he used to have religious discussions with Jain dharma divakar Chuathmalji Maharaj, who realized Anand Rishi Ji's capability to become Acharya, and conveyed his wish it to his followers. Anand Rishi Ji started many programs to benefit Shravaks. While in Ghodnadi for chaturmas, he decided to establish a religious center called Shri. Tilok Ratna Sthanakvasi Jain Dharmik Pariksha Board. It was established in Ahmednagar on 25 November 1936. In 1952, at Sadri Sadhu Sammelan in Rajasthan, Anand Rishi Ji was declared as the Prime Minister of Jain Shraman Sangha. In 1953, many renowned Jain sadhus came together for a common chaturmas in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. On 13 May 1964 (Phalguna Shukla Ekadasi), Anand Rishi Ji became second Acharya of Shraman Sangha. The ceremony took place in Ajmer, Rajasthan. After his chaturmas in 1974 in Mumbai, Anand Rishi Ji arrived in Pune. A huge welcome ceremony took place at Shaniwar Wada. On 13 February 1975 (Maagha shukla dvitiya), he was awarded the title Rashtra Sant by Maharashtra's chief minister Vasantrao Naik. This was also the year of his 75th birthday. The same year, Anand Foundation was established. 1987 was the diamond jubilee year of his consecration as a sadhu. It was celebrated with nine consecrations, and in the presence of Pujya Shankaracharya and Chief Minister Shankarrao Chavan. One more divine thing about the revered Acharya is that he had a PADAM symbol in his foot middle. He would exhibit that only to those devotees who forbid one of his habit or vowed some PRAN for lifetime. He was the founder of many educational institutes.

They are based in the town of B√©ziers and their home stadium is the Stade de Saucli√®res. The idea to merge the three football teams in order to have a championship team came in 2006, but a Championnat de France amateur (CFA) team was not created until 2007. B√©ziers won promotion to professional football in 2017‚Äì18 for the first time, and played in Ligue 2 for one season. As of the 2020‚Äì21 season it plays in Championnat National 2, after two consecutive relegations.  Current squad  : B-players used on the first team 2019-20  History  Since 2006, a fusion project between the three biterrois clubs, the Avenir Sportif Saint- Chinian, the Football Club B√©ziers M√©diterran√©e and the B√©ziers-M√©diterran√©e Football Cheminots, is pushed back by diverse administrative issues. One of the issues, seemingly minor, was the choice of the colors of the new club. while Avenir Sportif Saint-Chinian rooted for yellow and black, the two other clubs wished to see the club adorn the red and blue, the colors of the city of B√©ziers. In 2007, the three clubs reached a settlement, and fused into the AS B√©ziers. ASB then took part in the CFA 2, with a division coming from the former club of AS Saint-Chinian, the best ranked of the three clubs before the fusion. However this first season was devoted to sportive and administrative amelioration, and the club was relegated in the honor division of their league at the end of the season. At the end of the following year, ASB was back in the CFA 2, and was the first of its group securing promotion only two years after being relegated in regional elite, earning the title of champions of the CFA 2. In its first season in the CFA, AS B√©ziers went up and down and was nearly relegated before being reinstated due to the high number of administrative relegations in other clubs. In the three following seasons, the club held its ground in the low in the ranks of the CFA, the 2014‚Äì15 season was historic for Xavier Collin and his players since the club was promoted into the Championnat National for the first time in its history. It was an exceptional season for the club, even if the title of the CFA was won by CS Sedan Ardennes. Xavier Collin, in high spirits due to his title of best coach of the CFA of the year, prepared for the first season of the club in the third level of French football, imitating past teams from B√©ziers who brought the club of AS B√©ziers in second division in the 1980s After three seasons of the club maintaining itself in the Championnat National, it ends on the second step of the podium of the championship under Mathieu Chabert on the last day of the 2017‚Äì18 season, cementing its spot in French professional football and allowing the club to move into the Ligue 2.  Sporting history  At the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, AS B√©ziers has participated in its history three times in the Championnat National, five times in the CFA and two times in CFA 2. It has also participated in eleven Coupe de France. The competitions won by the club are the 2009 DH Languedoc-Roussillon and 2010 Championnat National 3 , it was also vice-champion of the 2017‚Äì18 Championnat National  Stadiums  The main home stadium of the club is the Stade de Saucli√®res previously used by the AS B√©ziers H√©rault club in its glory days. It is located on avenue Fernand Sastre in B√©ziers. The club may also be lent the Stade Raoul-Barri√®re by the rugby club AS B√©ziers H√©rault.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Castro Verde e Cas√©vel. In 2001, its resident population included 3819 inhabitants. History Turdetani, Roman and Arab peoples left behind several markers in the lands, although its settlements were primarily the consequence of Lusitanian castros that dotted the landscape. With the arrival the Romans in the Iberian peninsula, the region of Castro Verde began to be settled by shepherds and farmers. Its toponym, Castrum Veteris, was associated with a Roman military outpost which helped to protect the small pastoral communities from the 1st century BC, and later prospectors who searched for metal ore within the White Pyrite Belt. The Reconquista placed the region on the historical map; historical tradition holds that it was in S√£o Pedro das Cabe√ßas that the famous Battle of Ourique was waged by forces of Portuguese nobleman Afonso Henriques, who presumably decapitated five Moorish kings during the battle. Historically, the battle occurred on the plains of Ourique, a vast territory that included Castro Verde. In addition, the toponymic name of S√£o Pedro das Cabe√ßas came from legends that indicated that a number of cadavers and skulls found in these lands, from the numerous battles. Ecclesiastically, Castro Verde was a priory of the commendatory of Saint James (), who received four moios of wheat and barley, and 20,000 r√©is for his annual land rents. Initially, the Dukes of Aveiro were the donatary chieftains of these lands, but they were eventually integrated into the possessions of the Crown. Castro Verde received its political and administrative autonomy through a foral issued by King Manuel I on 20 November 1510, which in itself indicated the centre's importance in the 16th century. Geography The roadway leading to the Royal Basillica of Castro Verde, named in honour of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o The parish of Castro Verde, occupies almost half of the municipality, and represents one of the more important centres of Beja, owing to its population and rich natural resources. Within an area of approximately , it is the central place of region that includes several smaller localities, including: Aivados, Almeirim, Esta√ß√£o de Ourique, Geraldos, Monte Serro, Namorados and Pi√ßarras. The superficial soils of this territory are generally poor, but the area's mineral wealth, particularly in the interior, has been explored since the first settlers arrived in the region. Geographically, the parish's territory falls within one of the more important avian and bio-regions of the country, classified as a Zona de Protec√ß√£o Especial (Special Protection Zone). Its steppes continue to be used by shepherds to graze their herds. Being the municipal seat and residence of 50% of the region's population, Castro Verde is equipped with many of the essential services. With the growth of its population in recent years, the area has become more developed, including the south-lands, where new leisure space were established. Architecture The simple profile of the Chapel of S√£o Pedro das Cabe√ßas, on the outskirts of Geraldos The ornate facade of the Church of Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios The architectural importance of the settlement is highlighted by the Royal Basilica built in 1713, a church whose interior is covered in polychromatic tiles, depicting the legendary Battle of Ourique, and site of the museum of the royal treasury. Near this church, at the beginning of Rua D. Afonso I, is Church of Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios and the Museum of Lucerne, another centre that promotes the cultural heritage of the parish/municipality. Civic * Commemorative Pillory of the Battle of Ourique (), although constructed in 1785 alongside the hermitage of S√£o Pedro, this marker was moved to the site of the municipal council hall around 1960, just after being ruined by a lightning strike.

Located along the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River, the mill complex currently consists of a millhouse, breastshot wheel, and milldam, all of which are operative. The mill is the only structure in Pigeon Forge listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Now a souvenir shop and restaurant, the Pigeon Forge Mill was once part of a small industrial complex established by local businessman Isaac Love (1783-1854) that included the iron forge for which the city was named. The mill was initially used to grind grain-- mainly corn, wheat, and oats-- for local farmers. During the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865), the mill powered several looms which produced cloth for the military. In the early 1900s, a generator was installed at the mill which provided electricity to the area until 1930. After the establishment of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park a few miles to the south in 1934, Pigeon Forge gradually evolved into a tourist boom town, and the mill became a popular stop for passing tourists. Location The Pigeon Forge Mill is situated on the east bank of the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River, which flows down out of the Great Smoky Mountains to the south and passes through Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge before joining the Little Pigeon River proper in Sevierville a few miles downstream from the mill. The mill is accessible via Old Mill Avenue, which intersects US 441 (Parkway, Light #7) near the center of Pigeon Forge. A small plaza of shops, known as the Old Mill Square, has developed in the mill's immediate vicinity. History The Pigeon Forge Mill is located on land that was originally part of a plot of land granted in 1810 to Mordecai Lewis (1751-1817), a Revolutionary War veteran from Virginia. Before his death, Lewis may have erected a tub mill along the river (no longer standing).J. A. Sharp, \\"The Historic Beginnings of Pigeon Forge.\\" Sevier County Library History Center website. Retrieved: 2007-09-15. In 1817, Lewis's son-in-law, Isaac Love, built the iron forge for which the city would eventually be named. Taking advantage of a Tennessee state law that allowed tax incentives for the creation of iron works on unfarmable land, Love acquired over of the surrounding country. Love mined brown hematite ore in the hills northeast of the forge, and transported the ore to the forge using ox-drawn wagons. The forge included a bloomery furnace which converted the ore into pig iron, and a trip hammer that molded the pig iron into bar iron.Robbie Jones, The Historic Architecture of Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tenn.: Smoky Mountain Historical Society, 1997), pp. 24-25, 30, 44. In 1830, Love and his sons built a large gristmill adjacent to the iron furnace, which was used by local farmers to grind grain. As his iron business was never profitable, Love eventually ceased iron production, and sold the entire operation to Alexander Preston in 1841. On May 29 of that same year, Isaac's son, William, established a post office for the community that had developed around the complex, giving it the name \\"Pigeon Forge.\\" Preston operated the Pigeon Forge iron works under the name \\"Sweden Furnace\\" until 1849, when he sold the mill and furnace to local businessman John Sevier Trotter (1807-1884). By 1856, Trotter was producing two tons of bar iron annually at the Pigeon Forge furnace. During the U.S. Civil War, Trotter-- a Union supporter-- installed looms in the mill to furnish uniforms for local Union volunteers (Trotter's son, William, commanded a company at the Battle of Fort Sanders in late 1863).Pinkney Seaton, Beulah Linn (ed.), \\"Abstracts of the Civil War Diary of Lt. P.P. Seaton,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 20, no. 3 (Autumn 1994): 9-16. After the war, Trotter expanded the mill, most notably adding a 60-rpm, 30-horsepower wooden wheel (the current breastshot wheel was a later addition), and establishing a sawmill at the site. Trotter's son, George, dismantled and sold the iron furnace in 1885, but continued operating the mill. In December 1900, the Pigeon Forge Mill was purchased by local businessman A.T. Householder. Shortly afterward a generator was installed, providing electricity to the string of houses that occupied the river opposite the mill. The current milldam was completed in 1916.Beulah Linn, \\"The West Fork of the Little Pigeon River,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Journal 22, no. 2 (Summer 1996): 3. The mill was remodeled several times throughout the 20th century by subsequent owners to cater to the tourist traffic along US-441. Design The Pigeon Forge Mill is a three-story structure supported by by yellow poplar logs, which in turn rest on several pillars of large river rock (now reinforced by concrete). These pillars have helped preserve the mill through several disastrous floods, most notably floods in 1875 and 1920, both of which washed away bridges at the mill site. The interior of the mill consists of hand-hewn hemlock and oak walls, held together by hickory pegs, and the millhouse's exterior walls have been weatherboarded with yellow poplar boards. The floor consists of nailed pine boards. The elongated section on the north side of the millhouse was built in the latter half of the 19th century to house the mill's new sawmill. The Pigeon Forge Mill makes use of both the breatshot wheel that characterizes its exterior and several smaller tub wheels. Water is diverted to the wheels via the milldam, which spans the length of the river. The mill uses two two- ton French burr millstones for grinding.

It is located north-east of the Shetland Islands. The field is located mainly in Block 211/12a. Resources are estimated to total of oil, of which are recoverable reserves. History The Magnus oilfield was discovered in March 1974 by BP. The discovery was made below the seabed in the younger sands of the Late Jurassic by the semi-submersible drilling rig Sedco 703\\\\. Similarly to several other fields in the area, the field was named after the Viking saint‚ÄìMagnus of Orkney. It was announced on 24 January 2017 that BP will sell a 25% share of the field and turn over the operatorship to EnQuest . Fabrication of the Magnus structure began in 1980 at Highland Fabricators' yard at Nigg Bay in the Cromarty Firth. The jacket of the Magnus platform, the main oil export pipeline to the Ninian Central Platform, and the Northern Leg Gas Pipeline to Brent A were installed by 1982. In May 1996, the production started at the South Magnus field. First oil from the field was achieved in August 1983. The enhanced oil recovery project was proposed in 2000. It was implemented in 2003. Reserves Magnus field's reserves are estimated to contain of oil, of which are recoverable reserves. Technical description The field is developed by a single central combined drilling and production platform. The Magnus jacket is the largest single piece steel structure in the North Sea. It was designed, manufactured and installed by John Brown Offshore. The original system also included seven subsea producing wells which were later turned around to water injection duty. The topsides for Magnus were designed by Matthew Hall EngineeringMatthew Hall Engineering publicity brochure n.d. but c. 1990 which was also responsible for procurement, project management, construction management, offshore installation services and commissioning assistance. They were awarded the contract in December 1978. Initially there were facilities for 17 oil production wells, five water injection wells, and nine spare slots. The production capacity was 140,000 barrels of oil per day and 2.5 million standard cubic metres of gas per day. There are two production trains each with two stages of separation with the first stage operating at a pressure of 28 barg. Natural gas liquids were extracted from the gas stream using a turbo-expander/re-compressor system. Electricity generation was powered by three 27 MW GE Frame 5 gas turbines. All the gas compressors were driven by electric motors, not by gas turbines. The topside accommodation was for 200 people. There were 19 topside modules and the topsides weight was 31,000 tonnes. The produced oil is transported by a long pipeline to the Ninian Central platform, and further to the Sullom Voe Terminal. Produced natural gas from Magnus, together with gas from the Thistle and Murchison fields, is transported by a long pipeline to Brent A and further through the FLAGS to St Fergus in Aberdeenshire. Enhanced oil recovery project A commemorative cube produced by BP containing a sample of oil from the Magnus oilfield To increase the recoverable oil from the field and to extend the field life, an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project was implemented. The EOR project involved importing gas from the two West of Shetland fields Foinaven and Schiehallion to the Sullom Voe terminal where liquefied petroleum gas is added to natural gas. This gas stream is then transported by another pipeline to the Magnus platform where it is reinjected into the Magnus reservoir to aid pressure support and increased oil recovery. It is expected to increase the recoverable oil reserves by and extend the field life to beyond 2015. The project cost around ¬£320 million.

Shahar's 1981 study Fourth Estate: A History of Women in the Middle Ages was the first to specifically examine the role of women in the medieval period. The book is used as a text for gender studies and medieval history classes. This, and her subsequent books, have been published in both Hebrew and English. She has written historical articles in these languages as well as French, and has translated three books from Latin to Hebrew. Biography Shulamith Shahar was born in Latvia in 1928, the youngest of three daughters of industrialist Moshe Weinstock and his wife Deborah. In 1933, the family emigrated to Mandate Palestine, moving to Haifa. At the time, Shahar spoke only Russian. Her middle sister, Dina, died in the early 1940s during a German massacre of Jews outside Riga. In high school, Shahar served in the Haganah, a defence force, where she was in charge of an arms depot. After graduating, she attended Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she soon earned her bachelor's degree in history. At age 19, Shahar married Yitzhak Cohen. They had one child, Evyatar, and divorced when he was two. Shahar then returned to Jerusalem to pursue a master's degree. To support herself, Shahar taught at a high school. In 1954, Shahar met writer David Shahar at a Purim Party. They lived together for two years before marrying. The couple had two children, a boy and a girl. The day after the birth of their daughter, Shulamith's son Evyatar was killed in an army training accident. After her second marriage, Shulamith Shahar continued her education, and received a scholarship to the Sorbonne. She wrote her doctoral dissertation while living in Paris. On her return to Israel, Shahar became a professor at Tel Aviv University, eventually becoming department head. She retired at age 64 to pursue the career she had always wanted: social work. Shahar is now chairman of a non-profit association which manages a home for battered wives in Jerusalem. David Shahar died in 1997. For the last few years of his life, he divided his time between Israel and Paris; Shulamith Shahar remained in Israel, in the home they shared for decades. Academic career In 1981, Shahar published a groundbreaking study, Fourth Estate: A History of Women in the Middle Ages. The study was published in book form in 1983, and subsequently translated into English. \\"The first historical work that dealt with history and way of life of women in an era that was always told from a male perspective\\", Fourth Estate is often used in gender studies and medieval history courses. Her work has made Shahar a feminist role model, although she claims to be uninterested in the theory of feminism. In an interview, Shahar explained: \\"I always preferred to study things that interest me personally. To produce good writing one needs genuine emotion, and there can be no such emotion if the writer does not identify deeply with the subject of the writing.\\" Shahar's second book, Childhood and the Middle Ages, was published in 1990 and released in both English and Hebrew. It was translated in German in 1991. According to Shahar, her research disproved the previously popular notion that medieval infant mortality rates caused parents of the time to love their children less than modern parents do. Her third book, Growing Old in the Middle Ages: Winter Clothes Us in Shadow and Pain (1995) was also published in Hebrew and English. Both have proved very popular in Israel. She has also published dozens of articles in Hebrew, French, and English. In addition to her original works, Shahar translated The Letters of Abelard and Heloise into Hebrew from Latin. She has also translated into Hebrew 2 twelfth-century autobiographies, one by a Catholic monk and one by a Jew who converted to Christianity. Awards In 2003, Shahar was awarded the Israel Prize, for general history.

It is run by college students and alumni. It aims to educate \\"poverty stricken\\" and \\"slum dwelling\\" students. Its mission is to eradicate illiteracy from society. Kartavya has increased to 12 chapters across India. Kartavya also provides employment to people through recruitment directed at college students looking to teach. Vocational training currently provides training to about 150 people. In terms of women empowerment efforts, currently 65 women are being taught. History Kartavya was founded by a 1999 cohort of students of IIT ISM Dhanbad led by Amresh Mishra, who is an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer. Initially, its classes were held in a temple in Lahbani Basti, [Dhaiya]. Later, it got its own building. This was christened Centre 1 Dhanbad. Initially, its target was childhood education. It expanded to address other problems, including vocational training, woman's empowerment (with a direction to remove social and economical inequalities) and health. In 2007, the Library of Centre 1 was initiated. It aims to assist children in their homework and studies, as their household condition may be incompatible with studying. In 2008, Centre 2 at Dhanbad was started to extend this mission. On 27 October 2008, it became a national NGO under the name Kartavaya An effort towards educated India.  Mission  Each centre aims to eradicate illiteracy and other socioeconomic problems from society.  Method  Kartavya mission is to bring metamorphosis to a village or slum. Parameters decide whether a village is appropriate for \\"adoption\\" by Kartavya. It is done with a \\"deterministic questionnaire\\" related to educational, health and other decisive factors. If the parameters match, a one-year development plan is framed. Next is to recruit a team to establish the centre, develop infrastructure and raise funds. After the Centre for Basic Informal Education is established, the next step is establishing the library. The aim of the library is to provide the platform for self-study and self-learning that is crucial for the development of the children. The center works to get the children admitted to nearby \\"good\\" schools. After this basic setup, other dimensions are also explored, including health care, skill development, vocational training, woman's empowerment and awareness. Sources of funds Kartavya receives its funds from the following sources: *Newspaper collection from the hostels of colleges. *Voluntary donations by colleges alumni, faculties and other philanthropists. *Annual minimal collection from college students.''' *\\"Caution money\\" by final year students. *Child Sponsorship by various individuals and organizations including college alumni, faculty and students. Projects Center and library The Center and Library are mainly concerned with childhood education. These are often locally referred to as \\"the soul of Kartavya\\". Classes are held in the evening. These classes are offered by concerned college students. To cover classes during events such as mid-semester and semester exams and vacations, graduates, undergraduates and enthusiasts are recruited. The Library facilitates self- study and homework. It provides an environment and infrastructure. It has its own staff besides Kartvaya Volunteer. The Centre and Library are handled by the Centre and Library teams, respectively. Each team has its own leader. A school team takes care of the affairs of the children and schools. It works in concordance with the other teams. The Skill Development Cell (SDC) team manages the development of individual interests and talents among students. These interests have a varied range, with activities such as dancing, painting and gardening.

People are made aware about the health habits and clean environments. Also, a regular medical camp is organized to identify any disease outbreaks. Vocational training and women's empowerment Kartavya is determined to eradicate social and economic gaps from society. This can be achieved by enhancing the poor's living standard. Vocational training equips destitute people (especially females) with practical day-to-day skills which make them economically independent and self- reliant. Women's empowerment is considered a recipe to balance the equation of social inequalities. It is done by making women aware about their rights and responsibilities. This is inculcated through education. Saheli \\"Saheli\\" is the project of Rotary Club, Dhanbad extended to Kartavya Dhanbad Chapter. This project is to train women in skills such as sewing, hand knitting, painting etc. Rotary Club has given financial aid for this project, including computers and sewing machines.The program serves about 30 women.

Sinotyrannus is known from a single incomplete fossil specimen including a partial skull, from the Early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China. Though it is not much younger than primitive tyrannosauroids such as Dilong, it is similar in size to later forms such as Tyrannosaurus. It was much larger than contemporary tyrannosauroids; reaching a total estimated length of , it is the largest known theropod from the Jiufotang Formation. The type species is S. kazuoensis, described by Ji et al., in 2009.  Description  Life restoration with size compared to a human The holotype of Sinotyrannus is KZV-001, a disarticulated partial skeleton including the front portion of the skull, three dorsal vertebrae, the incomplete ilia, three articulated manual phalanges (including an ungual), and other fragmentary bones. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at 9 meters (30 ft) and its weight at 2.5 tonnes (2.75 short tons). In 2016 it was given a smaller size of 7.5 meters (24.6 ft) and 1.2 tonnes (1.3 short tons). The preserved cranial elements include the premaxillae, dentary, and anterior portions of the maxillae and nasals. The dorsal margin of the maxilla is unusually concave unlike the convex condition in tyrannosaurids. The nares are large and elliptical, supporting its relation to proceratosauridae. The dentary gradually curves upwards as it approaches its front edge. Many teeth are preserved attached to the maxillae, with a roughly equal number of denticles on each side, similarly to those of tyrannosaurids. Sinotyrannus could perceivably have had a tall nasal crest like other proceratosaurids, although not enough of its nasals are preserved to be certain. The three preserved vertebrae have very tall neural spines. The proportions of the preserved manual phalanges support the idea that they belong to the second finger, and the ungual has a deep groove on each side. The ilia are mainly present as molds, with the mold of the external side of the left ilium being the most complete. The preacetabular blade is short and wide, with a massive pubic peduncle, while the postacetabular blade is longer and thinner, with a triangular ischial peduncle. These traits of the ilia differentiate it from more advanced tyrannosauroids such as the tyrannosaurids. Sinotyrannus was among the largest basal tyrannosauroids known, repudiating the previously presumed trend that tyrannosauroids gradually increased in size throughout the Cretaceous period from small basal forms like Dilong to advanced apex predators such as Tyrannosaurus. Classification The original description of Sinotyrannus proposed that it could have been the earliest tyrannosaurid due to its large size, but subsequent analyses place it as a proceratosaurid tyrannosauroid. It is considered to be part of a clade containing Juratyrant and Stokesosaurus, as they all reputedly share a narrow preacetabular notch. A 2016 analysis instead placed Juratyrant and Stokesosaurus outside of proceratosauridae and proposed that Sinotyrannus is a sister taxon of Yutyrannus within proceratosauridae.

Wendt argues that anarchy is not inherent in the international system in the way in which other schools of international relations theory envision it, but rather it is a construct of the nation- states in the system. At the core of constructivist thought is the idea that many core aspects of international relations are socially constructed (they are given their form by ongoing processes of social practice and interaction), rather than inherent, contrary to the assumptions of neorealism and neoliberalism. According to Wendt, the two basic tenets of constructivism are:Wendt, Alexander, Social Theory of International Politics, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999). * The structures of human association are determined primarily by shared ideas rather than material forces. * The identities and interests of purposive actors are constructed by these shared ideas rather than given by nature. The constructivist sentiment is summed up in the following extract from the article: \\"I argue that self-help and power politics do not follow either logically or causally from anarchy and that if today we find ourselves in a self-help world, this is due to process, not structure. There is no 'logic' of anarchy apart from the practices that create and instantiate one structure of identities and interests rather than another; structure has no existence or causal powers apart from process. Self-help and power politics are institutions, not essential features, of anarchy. Anarchy is what states make of it\\".Wendt, Alexander, \\"Anarchy is what States Make of It: the Social Construction of Power Politics\\", International Organization 46, no. 2 (Spring 1992): 391‚Äì425.

Ulises Moulines (ed.), Structuralist Theory of Science: Focal Issues, New Results, Walter de Gruyter, 1996, p. 226. is an active research program in the philosophy of science, which was first developed in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s by several analytic philosophers. Overview Structuralism asserts that all aspects of reality are best understood in terms of empirical scientific constructs of entities and their relations, rather than in terms of concrete entities in themselves. For instance, the concept of matter should be interpreted not as an absolute property of nature in itself, but instead of how scientifically-grounded mathematical relations describe how the concept of matter interacts with other properties, whether that be in a broad sense such as the gravitational fields that mass produces or more empirically as how matter interacts with sense systems of the body to produce sensations such as weight. Its aim is to comprise all important aspects of an empirical theory in one formal framework. The proponents of this meta-theoretic theory are Bas van Fraassen, Frederick Suppe, Patrick Suppes, Ronald Giere,Alisa Bokulich, Peter Bokulich (eds.), Scientific Structuralism, Springer, p. 140 n. 52.

The term \\"structural realism\\" for the variation of scientific realism motivated by structuralist arguments, was coined by American philosopher in 1968.Maxwell, G. (1968), \\"Scientific Methodology and the Causal Theory of Perception\\", in: Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave (eds.), Problems in the Philosophy of Science, Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company. In 1998, the British structural realist philosopher James Ladyman distinguished epistemic and ontic forms of structural realism.Ladyman, J., 1998. \\"What is structural realism?\\" Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, 29: 409‚Äì424. Variations Epistemic structural realism The philosophical concept of (scientific) structuralism is related to that of epistemic structural realism (ESR). ESR, a position originally and independently held by Henri Poincar√© (1902),Henri Poincar√©, Science and Hypothesis. New York: Dover, 1952 [1902].Poincar√©'s structuralism was combined with neo-Kantian views about the nature of arithmetic. Bertrand Russell (1927),Bertrand Russell (1927). The Analysis of Matter, London: George Allen & Unwin. and Rudolf Carnap (1928),Rudolf Carnap (1928). The Logical Structure of the World, Berkeley: University of California Press. was resurrected by John Worrall (1989), who proposes that there is retention of structure across theory change. Worrall, for example, argued that Fresnel's equations imply that light has a structure and that Maxwell's equations, which replaced Fresnel's, do also; both characterize light as vibrations. Fresnel postulated that the vibrations were in a mechanical medium called \\"ether\\"; Maxwell postulated that the vibrations were of electric and magnetic fields. The structure in both cases is the vibrations and it was retained when Maxwell's theories replaced Fresnel's.J. Worrall (1989). \\"Structural realism: The best of both worlds?\\" Dialectica, 43: p. 119; available online. Because structure is retained, structural realism both (a) avoids pessimistic meta- induction and (b) does not make the success of science seem miraculous, i.e., it puts forward a no-miracles argument.The term is due to Hilary Putnam (see Putnam, H., 1975. Mathematics, Matter and Method, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 73). Newman problem The so-called Newman problem (also Newman's problem, Newman objection, Newman's objection) refers to the critical notice of Russell's The Analysis of Matter (1927) published by Max Newman in 1928.M. H. A. Newman, 1928. \\"Mr. Russell's causal theory of perception,\\" Mind, 37: 137‚Äì148. Newman argued that the ESR claim that one can know only the abstract structure of the external world trivializes scientific knowledge. The basis of his argument is the realization that \\"[a]ny collection of things can be organized so as to have structure W, provided there are the right number of them\\", where W is an arbitrary structure.Roman Frigg and Ioannis Votsis (2011), \\"Everything you always wanted to know about structural realism but were afraid to ask,\\" European Journal for Philosophy of Science 1(2):227‚Äì276, esp. p. 250. Response to the Newman problem John Worrall (2000) advocates a version of ESR augmented by the Ramsey sentence reconstruction of physical theoriesWorrall, J. (2000), \\"Miracles and Models: Saving Structural Realism?\\", paper given to the Annual Meeting of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science, Sheffield, 2000. (a Ramsey sentence aims at rendering propositions containing non-observable theoretical terms clear by substituting them with observable terms). John Worrall and Elie Georges Zahar (2001) claim that Newman's objection applies only if a distinction between observational and theoretical terms is not made.Worrall, J. and Zahar, E. (2001), \\"Ramseyfication and Structural Realism\\", Appendix IV in E. Zahar, Poincare's Philosophy: From Conventionalism to Phenomenology, Chicago and La Salle (IL): Open Court. Ramsey-style epistemic structural realism is distinct from and incompatible with the original Russellian epistemic structural realismVotsis, I. (2004), The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account, University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, p. 122. (the difference between the two being that Ramsey-style ESR makes an epistemic commitment to Ramsey sentences, while Russellian ESR makes an epistemic commitment to abstract structures, that is, to (second-order) isomorphism classes of the observational structure of the world and not the (first-order) physical structure itself).Votsis, I. (2004), The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account, University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, pp. 43 and 122. Ioannis Votsis (2004) claims that Russellian ESR is also impervious to the Newman objection: Newman falsely attributed the trivial claim \\"there exists a relation with a particular abstract structure\\" to ESR, while ESR makes the non-trivial claim that there is a unique physical relation that is causally linked with a unique observational relation and the two are isomorphic.Votsis, I. (2004), The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account, University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, p. 129. Further criticism The traditional scientific realist and notable critic of structural realism Stathis Psillos (1999) remarks that \\"structural realism is best understood as issuing an epistemic constraint on what can be known and on what scientific theories can reveal.\\"Stathis Psillos, Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth, Routledge, 1999, p. 142. He thinks that ESR faces a number of insurmountable objections.Votsis, I. (2004), The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account, University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, pp. 68‚Äì9. These include among others that ESR's only epistemic commitment is uninterpreted equations which are not by themselves enough to produce predictionsStathis Psillos, Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth, Routledge, 1999, p. 141. and that the \\"structure versus nature\\" distinction that ESR appeals to cannot be sustained.Stathis Psillos, Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth, Routledge, 1999, p. 148. Votsis (2004) replies that the structural realist \\"does subscribe to interpreted equations, but attempts to distinguish between interpretations that link the terms to observations from those that do not\\"Votsis, I. (2004), The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account, University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, pp. 73‚Äì4. and he can appeal to the Russellian view that \\"nature\\" just means the non-isomorphically specifiable part of entities.Votsis, I. (2004), The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account, University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, p. 104. Psillos also defends David Lewis's descriptive-causal theory of referenceStathis Psillos, Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth, Routledge, 1999, p. 279. (according to which the abandoned theoretical terms after a theory change are regarded as successfully referring \\"after all\\") and claims that it can adequately deal with referential continuity in conceptual transitions, during which theoretical terms are abandoned,Stathis Psillos, Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth, Routledge, 1999, p. 271. thus rendering ESR redundant. Votsis (2004) replies that a scientific realist needs not tie the approximate truth of a theory to referential success.Votsis, I. (2004), The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account, University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, p. 148. Notably, structural realism initially did not dictate any particular theory of reference;Votsis, I. (2004), The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account, University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, p. 219. however Votsis (2012) proposed a structuralist theory of reference according to which \\"scientific terms are able to refer to individual objects, i.e. in a term-by- term fashion, but that to fix this reference requires taking into account the relations these objects instantiate.\\"Ioannis Votsis, \\"A Structuralist Theory of Reference\\", Invited talk presented at the Reference and Scientific Realism Symposium, Wuhan University, August 17, 2012. Ontic structural realism While ESR claims that only the structure of reality is knowable, ontic structural realism (OSR) goes further to claim that structure is all there is. In this view, reality has no \\"nature\\" underlying its observed structure. Rather, reality is fundamentally structural, though variants of OSR disagree on precisely which aspects of structure are primitive. OSR is strongly motivated by modern physics, particularly quantum field theory, which undermines intuitive notions of identifiable objects with intrinsic properties. Some early quantum physicists held this view, including Hermann Weyl (1931),Hermann Weyl, 1950 [1931]. The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics (translated by H. P. Robertson). New York: Dover. Ernst Cassirer (1936),Ernst Cassirer, 1956 [1936]. Determinism and Indeterminism in Modern Physics, New Haven: Yale University Press. and Arthur Eddington (1939).Arthur Eddington (1939), The Philosophy of Physical Science, Cambridge University Press. Recently, OSR has been called \\"the most fashionable ontological framework for modern physics\\".Kuhlmann, Meinard, \\"Quantum Field Theory\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). Max Tegmark takes this concept even further with the mathematical universe hypothesis, which proposes that, if our universe is only a particular structure, then it is no more real than any other structure.Berthold, Oswald. \\"Computational universes.\\" Berlin: Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin, Institut fur Informatik (2009). Definition of structure In mathematical logic, a mathematical structure is a standard concept. A mathematical structure is a set of abstract entities with relations between them. The natural numbers under arithmetic constitute a structure, with relations such as \\"is evenly divisible by\\" and \\"is greater than\\". Here the relation \\"is greater than\\" includes the element (3, 4), but not the element (4, 3). Points in space and the real numbers under Euclidean geometry are another structure, with relations such as \\"the distance between point P1 and point P2 is real number R1\\"; equivalently, the \\"distance\\" relation includes the element (P1, P2, R1). Other structures include the Riemann space of general relativity and the Hilbert space of quantum mechanics. The entities in a mathematical structure do not have any independent existence outside their participation in relations. Two descriptions of a structure are considered equivalent, and to be describing the same underlying structure, if there is a correspondence between the descriptions that preserves all relations.Esfeld, Michael. \\"Ontic structural realism and the interpretation of quantum mechanics.\\" European Journal for Philosophy of Science 3.1 (2013): 19‚Äì32. Many proponents of structural realism formally or informally ascribe \\"properties\\" to the abstract objects; some argue that such properties, while they can perhaps be \\"shoehorned\\" into the formalism of relations, should instead be considered distinct from relations. Proposed structures In quantum field theory (QFT), traditional proposals for \\"the most basic known structures\\" divide into \\"particle interpretations\\" such as ascribing reality to the Fock space of particles, and \\"field interpretations\\" such as considering the quantum wavefunction to be identical to the underlying reality. Varying interpretations of quantum mechanics provide one complication; another, perhaps minor, complication is that neither fields nor particles are completely localized in standard QFT. A third, less obvious, complication is that \\"unitarily inequivalent representations\\" are endemic in QFT; for example, the same patch of spacetime can be represented by a vacuum by an inertial observer, but as a thermal heat bath by an accelerating observer that perceives Unruh radiation, raising the difficult question of whether the vacuum structure or heat bath structure is the real structure, or whether both of these inequivalent structures are separately real. Another example, which does not require the complications of curved spacetime, is that in ferromagnetism, symmetry-breaking analysis results in inequivalent Hilbert spaces. More broadly, QFT's infinite degrees of freedom lead to inequivalent representations in the general case. In general relativity, scholars often grant a \\"basic structure\\" status to the spacetime structure, sometimes via its metric. See also * Constructive empiricism, a rival yet related viewVotsis, I.

They are particularly common in the historic county of Sussex, where more than 40 extant churches have one. They have their origins in the early Christian era, when pre-Christian worship was still popular, and were often merely symbolic structures‚Äîalthough they were sometimes used as genuine entrances. Functions Saxon-era St Nicholas' Church at Worth, West Sussex, has a Devil's door Before and during the Middle Ages, the north face of a church was considered to belong to the Devil and to people considered heathen. Churches were invariably built to the north of roads and tracks, to ensure their main entrance was on the south side. It was also common for them to be built on pre-Christian sacred sites. Such places were still considered sacred by their former worshippers, who would often continue to visit them. A doorway would often be inserted in the \\"heathen\\" north side of the church to allow them to enter and worship on the site. Because of the association of that side with the Devil, the name \\"Devil's door\\" became established. A later, and more common purpose, (especially in Sussex) was to allow the Devil to escape from the church. A widespread belief in the Middle Ages held that the Devil resided in an unbaptised child's soul; at the baptism, the Devil would be driven out of the child and had to be able to leave. Accordingly, a door was often built into the north wall for this purpose. These doors were often too small to have any real use, and were therefore only figurative. Most of the doors that remain have been bricked up‚Äîreputedly to prevent the Devil re-entering. Examples St Margaret's Church, Ditchling, Devil's door Devil's doors can be found throughout Britain, but are concentrated in the county of Sussex, where notable examples include: *St. Margaret's Church, Ditchling *St. Peter's Church, Hamsey *St. Helen's Church, Hangleton *All Saints Church, Patcham *St. Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting *St. Nicholas' Church, Worth References Notes Bibliography   Category:Church architecture Category:Medieval architecture Category:Doors Category:Paganism in Europe ","title":"Devil's door"},{"id":"24718318","text":"On either side of the posterior median sulcus of the spinal cord, and at a short distance from it, the posterior nerve roots are attached along a vertical furrow named the posterolateral sulcus.

Graham, (1977), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of California ruling that a lack of visual perception of an accident did not necessarily preclude recovery for negligent infliction of emotional distress.Santon, Katherine, The Worth of a Human Life (October 17, 2008). North Dakota Law Review Factual background Plaintiff Benjamin Krouse was in his parked car outside of his house. The plaintiff's wife was removing groceries from the car. The car driven by defendant Homer Graham collided with the parked car, injuring the plaintiff and killing his wife. The plaintiff did not see the car hit his wife, but he could see Graham's car approaching and he knew that his wife was in its path. The plaintiff sued for wrongful death and emotional distress, and the trial court returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant appealed from a denied motion for a new trial. Decision The defendant alleged error in a jury instruction that said that Krouse could recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress by simply being present at the scene of the accident. The court needed to determine whether the absence of visual perception of the accident precluded recovery under the criteria enunciated in the 1968 decision Dillon v. Legg. Dillon required the \\"sensory and contemporaneous observance\\" of the accident. The court ruled that, despite not having seen the impact, Krouse fully perceived the accident because he knew where his wife was seconds before the impact, he saw the car coming, and he knew that she must have been injured in the accident. For the first time in California, the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs, in a statutory action for wrongful death, may recover so-called \\"non-economic\\" damages: damages for the loss of the deceased's \\"love, companionship, comfort, care, assistance, protection, affection, society, [and] moral support.\\"Foundations of California Law of Wrongful Death: KROUSE v. GRAHAM (1977) Related cases A similar holding was made in the 1969 case Archibald v. Braverman, but Archibald was overruled by the 1989 case Thing v. La Chusa.

In the 1980s, RISK gained notoriety for his unique style and pushed the limits of graffiti: He was one of the first writers in Southern California to paint freight trains, and he pioneered writing on \\"heavens\\", or freeway overpasses. At the peak of his career he took graffiti from the streets and into the gallery with the launch of the Third Rail series of art shows, and later parlayed the name into a line of graffiti- inspired clothing. Biography Born to a Jewish familyThousand Oaks Acorn: \\"New Shul to honor graffiti artist, Canyon club owner at event\\" By Stephanie Bertholdo February 7, 2013 and raised in Louisiana, Graval moved with his family to Los Angeles in 1983 where he enrolled at University High School on the city‚Äôs west side. RISK made the high school his personal canvas, tagging his name everywhere during the day and returning at night to do pieces. In 1985, RISK and RIVAL started the graffiti crew WCA (West Coast Artists). RISK was one of seven high school students who received a scholarship to attend the Pasadena Art Institute. RISK would later go on to study fine art at USC. Later, RISK became involved in various Hollywood projects. His first was a photo shoot for Hot Rod magazine, and after the issue hit newsstands, he started getting more recognition as an artist outside the graffiti world. RISK continued to work on movie and music video sets, including the film Bill and Ted‚Äôs Excellent Adventure and videos for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ice Cube, Bad Religion and Michael Jackson. In 1988, RISK went to New York and painted subway cars, making him the first L.A. writer to have his work run, and probably the last (in 1989, the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority mandated that all subway cars be free of graffiti before they ran). The following year, RISK and SLICK were invited to travel to the U.K. to represent the U.S. at the Bridlington International Street Art Competition. They won the competition and took home a silver cup and silver spray can as trophies. Back in L.A., RISK continued to push the boundaries of graffiti, and he and fellow WCA writers embarked on a series of tours: \\"Bum Rush\\", an all-out bombing effort in the San Francisco Bay area; \\"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\\", a quest on which they hit everything from limos to private planes; and \\"Hitting Metal\\", a tour aimed at vehicles, street signs, heavens and any other metal objects they could find. Meanwhile, RISK had started putting his graffiti on canvases and co-founded Third Rail, a series of gallery shows. Knowing that many of the people at the shows could not afford his canvases, RISK started making T-shirts. RISK turned Third Rail into a successful clothing brand, with RISK winning designer of the year awards and sponsoring celebrities like Kid Rock. On December 13, 2008, Track 16 gallery in Santa Monica hosted RISK's first solo show Twenty-Six. The title of the show referred to the length of RISK's career and his lifelong dedication to letterforms. \\"Twenty-Six is a celebration of where I'm at today and where I have come from,\\" RISK explained. \\"I have been painting for 26 years; there are 26 letters in the alphabet‚ÄîI could not pick a better way to define myself and my view of graffiti art.\\"http://track16.com/exhibitions/2008-12-13-RISK/pr.php In 2018, Risk joined 2:32 AM Projects Management. In 2019, he worked on the artwork for Blink-182's eighth album Nine and in the lyric music video of its lead single, Blame It On My Youth. In 2019, Risk painted the largest public mural in Canada, at the disused St. Joseph's Health Centre site of Health Sciences North in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, as part of the city's Up Here Festival.Martha Dillman, \\"Muralist RISK transforms old Sudbury hospital into a work of art\\".

Etymology The name Seillean means \\"honeybee\\" in Gaelic. History The vessel was designated as a single- well oil production ship (SWOPS) when constructed for BP by Harland and Wolff in 1986-1988. The process plant, flare and the riser including subsea connection were designed and procured by Matthew Hall Engineering, which also provided construction assistance and commissioning of the oil production facilities. The original specification for the vesselMatthew Hall Engineering publicity brochure n.d. but c. 1990 was as follows: * Production capability - 15,000 barrels of oil per day, 10,000 barrels of produced water per day, 6 million standard cubic metres of gas per day * Production train - 1 train, 2 stages, 1st stage separator pressure 17 barg * Storage capacity - 318,000 barrels * Living accommodation - 45 berths The vessel was originally designed for a generic North Sea field well, although it was later assigned the Cyrus oilfield on Block 16/28 in the UK sector of the North Sea. Later she served on the Donan field. Seillean was sold by BP in 1993 to Reading & Bates. Brazilian oil company Petrobras signed a four-year charter for Seillean to develop the Roncador field. Seillean was upgraded and arrived in Brazil in December 1998. After acquisition of Reading & Bates by Transocean, the vessel was acquired by Frontier Drilling in 2002. She was moved to Jubarte field. In February 2006, the vessel started to operate in the Petrobras-operated Golfinho Field in the Espirito Santo Basin off Brazil. In 2007, Seillean was moved to Pipa 2 oilfield. In June 2010, Seillean was contracted for oil collection and processing at the Macondo Prospect to deal with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. With the purchase of Frontier Drilling in 2010, Seillean was acquired by Noble Corporation. She was renamed Noble Seillean and her flag was changed from Panama to Liberia. Seillean was sent for scrapping to Alang, India, on 26 September 2015. Description FPSO Seallean was a dynamically positioned monohull floating production, storage and offloading vessel.

She characterizes her activism as working for peace and justice, environmental causes and women's rights. She has traveled extensively promoting what she terms the conflict resolution by peaceful means‚Äîincluding leading \\"citizen diplomacy\\" delegations to Iran, the Gaza Strip, and Afghanistan. Evans served in California Governor Jerry Brown's cabinet and managed his 1992 campaign for the presidency. Evans is a co-founder of the women's anti-war activist organization Code Pink. She also currently serves as the board chair of the Rainforest Action Network, an organization whose mission is to preserve forests, protect the climate and uphold human rights by challenging corporate power and systemic injustice through frontline partnerships and strategic campaigns. She was married to Max Palevsky until his death on May 5, 2010 and currently lives in Venice, California. Early life Evans was born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada. She first became interested in what she terms social justice activism when she worked as a maid in a major Las Vegas hotel as a teenager‚Äîas her coworkers organized, she marched in favor of what she termed a living wage. Activism Her CODEPINK protest actions include disrupting Sarah Palin's speech at the Republican National Convention in 2008, and, in 2009, leading a protest in Santa Monica against Israeli cosmetics company Ahava. Upon returning from Afghanistan, she delivered signatures from women in that country and the US to President Obama asking him to send no new troops into the conflict there. In March, 2010, during a book signing by Karl Rove, she and other Code Pink members caused disruptions. At one point, Evans charged the stage towards Rove with a pair of handcuffs, declaring that she was making a citizen's arrest. On January 30, 2011, Evans was arrested for disruptive behavior at a Rancho Mirage hotel where she was leading a protest against David H. Koch and Charles G. Koch over their financial support of part of the Tea Party Movement. In the fall of 2019 Evans joined actress and activist Jane Fonda in a series of weekly rallies and acts of civil disobedience, called Fire Drill Fridays, at Washington DC's Capitol to highlight the global climate crisis, where Evans was arrested along with Fonda multiple times. Controversies In the summer of 2010, controversy arose over Evans' alleged 2008 remark to Debbie Lee, the mother of an American soldier killed in Iraq that \\"Your son deserved to die in Iraq if he was stupid enough to go over there.\\" Republican candidate Meg Whitman repeated this charge in her 2010 California gubernatorial campaign, demanding that Jerry Brown return money from a fundraiser that Evans hosted. Later during the controversy, Lee told the San Francisco Chronicle that she could not identify Evans and was not sure who made the insulting remark.

Idealists emphasized the possibility of international institutions such as the League of Nations.

Cambridge University Press, p. 13 Second Great Debate The \\"Second Great Debate\\" was a dispute between \\"scientific IR\\" scholars who sought to refine scientific methods of inquiry in international relations theory and those who insisted on a more historicist/interpretative approach to international relations theory. The debate is termed \\"realists versus behaviourists\\" or \\"traditionalism versus scientism\\".Guzzini, Stefano (1998) Realism in international relations and international political economy: the continuing story of a death foretold, New York: Routledge, P. 32 This debate would be resolved when neorealists such as Kenneth Waltz (1959, 1979) adopt a Behaviouralist, and hence positivist scientific approach to their studies. Inter-paradigm debate (Third Great Debate) Sometimes the inter-paradigm debate is considered to be a great debate and is therefore referred to as the \\"Third Great Debate\\". The inter- paradigm debate was a debate between liberalism, realism and radical international relations theories.Weaver, Ole,The rise and fall of the Inter- paradigm debate, International theory: positivism and beyond, Steve Smith, Ken Booth, Marysia Zalewski, p151 The debate has also been described as being between realism, institutionalism and structuralism. Fourth Great Debate The \\"Fourth Great Debate\\" was a debate between positivist theories and post- positivist theories of international relations. Confusingly, it is often described in literature as \\"The Third Great Debate\\" by those who reject the description of the inter-paradigm debate as a Great Debate.Y Lapid, The third debate: On the prospects of international theory in a post-positivist era, International Studies Quarterly (1989) 33, 235‚Äì254 This debate is concerned with the underlying epistemology of international relations scholarship and is also described as a debate between \\"rationalists\\" and \\"reflectivists\\".Smith, Steve (2007) \\"Introduction\\" in T. Dunne. M. Kuki, and S. Smith (eds.) International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 10 The debate was started by Robert Keohane in an International Studies Association debate in 1988 and can be considered an epistemological debate, about how we can know 'things' rather than an ontological one,Smith, S, (2007) 'Introduction' in Dunne, T., Kuki, M. and Smith, S. (eds.) International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity. Oxford: OUP. p. 5 that is to say a debate about what we can claim to know. As Balzacq and Baele summarize, this debate is \\"a discussion which, in the 1980s and 1990s, followed a composite claim for a more diverse, less epistemologically and ontologically na√Øve, and more critical IR\\". Fifth Great Debate? Brown remarking on the possibility of a \\"Fifth Great Debate\\" has suggested that the debate could concern critical realism but goes on to say 'let us hope not, because the first four great debates were singularly pointless affairs, and the fifth, when it arrives, is unlikely to be any different.Brown, C. (2007) Situating Critical Realism, Millennium - Journal of International Studies, 35/2: 409-16 Steve Smith argues that 'it is difficult to find any notion of a \\"fifth great debate\\" in the literature.Smith, S. (2008) The Oxford Handbook of International Relations, C. Reus-Smit, D. Snidal (eds.),Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 726 Criticism Steve Smith has argued that the differing positions have largely ignored each other meaning that it makes little sense to talk of 'debates' between rival theoretical frameworks. Emmanuel Navon has argued that the three debates are a sham since there is nothing new about debating human nature and human knowledge, while the 'third debate' artificially imports the deconstructionist French fad into the study of International Relations.Emmanuel Navon, \\"The Third Debate Revisited\\" Review of International Studies 27/4 (2001), pp. 611-625 See also *Rationalist‚Äìconstructivist debate References Further reading *Darshan Vigneswaran, Joel Quirk, International relations' first great debate: context and tradition, Issue 2001; Issue 2004 of Working paper, Dept. of International Relations, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University, 2004 *Mohamed Hamchi, ‚ÄúIR Fourth Debate: Pluralistic or Hegemonic?

He made aliyah to Mandatory Palestine in 1930, and studied at the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva with Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, receiving certification as a rabbi. He also studied in the Mizrachi teachers seminary in Jerusalem. At one point he resided in the Knesset Yisrael neighborhood. He helped establish the Bnei Akiva youth movement, and edited its publication Zra'im. In 1940 he founded the first Bnei Akiva yeshiva in Kfar Haroeh, serving as its headmaster and teaching Talmud and Jewish thought. He later established several yeshiva high schools and Hesder yeshivas for IDF soldiers. In addition, he founded the Hapoel HaMizrachi Rabbinical Association.Moshe-Zvi Neriah: Public Activities Knesset website In 1969 he was elected to the Knesset on the National Religious Party list for one term. He left the party in 1983 to establish the Religious Zionist Camp (also known as Mazad). Rabbi Neria died on the 19th of Kislev, 5756 (1995), at the age of 82.

This species is the sister species of Apis koschevnikovi and both are in the same subgenus as the western (European) honey bee, Apis mellifera.Engel, M.S. (1999) The taxonomy of recent and fossil honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Apis). Journal of Hymenoptera Research 8: pp. 165‚Äì196.Photos of Apis cerana A. cerana is known to live sympatrically along with Apis koschevnikovi within the same geographic location. Apis cerana colonies are known for building nests consisting of multiple combs in cavities containing a small entrance, presumably for defense against invasion by individuals of another nest.Nanork, P., et al. \\"Social parasitism by workers in queenless and queenright Apis cerana colonies.\\" Molecular ecology 16.5 (2007): 1107-1114. The diet of this honey bee species consists mostly of pollen and nectar, or honey.Haydak, Maykola H. \\"Honey bee nutrition.\\" Annual Review of Entomology 15.1 (1970): 143-156. Moreover, Apis cerana is known for its highly social behavior, reflective of its classification as a type of honey bee. The terms Apis cerana indica and Apis Indica or Indian honey bee, is an historic term, with all Asian hive bees now referred to as Apis cerana. Taxonomy and phylogeny thumb Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius described Apis cerana, also known as the eastern or Asian honey bee, in 1793. The genus name Apis is Latin for \\"bee\\". The eastern honey bee is of the Apidae family, one of the most diverse families of bees, including honey bees, carpenter bees, orchid bees, bumblebees, cuckoo bees, and even stingless bees.Michener, Charles Duncan. The bees of the world. Vol. 1. JHU Press, 2000. In the past, there has been discussion that Apis cerana and Apis mellifera are simply distinct races of the same species. This is essentially due to overwhelming similarities in both morphology and behavior, as both are medium-sized bees (10-11mm) that generally build multiple comb nests inside cavities. Other honey bee species, including the giant honey bees Apis dorsata and Apis laboriosa, generally construct nests consisting of a single comb in open areas.Winston, Mark L. The biology of the honey bee. Harvard University Press, 1991. However, despite the striking similarities between Apis cerana and Apis mellifera, there is evidence to suggest that these two species are quite distinct; for example, mating between these species does not produce offspring. In addition, while Apis mellifera colonies can reach sizes of up to 50,000 or more individuals, Apis cerana colonies are relatively small, with only around 6,000 to 7,000 workers. Morevoer, Apis cerana is found predominantly in the Eastern Asian region of the world, while Apis mellifera is found predominantly in the Western European and African region of the world. For these reasons, it has now been concluded that these are in fact two separate species, contrary to prior beliefs. Infraspecific groupings Historically, Apis cerana has been subdivided into eight subspecies according to Engel (1999), they are: * Apis cerana cerana Fabricius (= sinensis) (Chinese honey bee) - Afghanistan, Pakistan, northern India, northern Vietnam, southern and coastal China, Taiwan, South Korea and North Korea, and Primorsky Krai in Russia * Apis cerana heimifeng Engel (black Chinese honey bee) - highlands in central China * Apis cerana indica Fabricius (Indian honey bee) - southern India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh * Apis cerana japonica Fabricius (Japanese honey bee) - Japan * Apis cerana javana Enderlein (Javan honey bee) - Java to East Timor * Apis cerana johni Skorikov (Sumatran honey bee) - Sumatra * Apis cerana nuluensis Tingek, Koeniger and Koeniger (Bornean honey bee) - Borneo * Apis cerana skorikovi Engel (= himalaya) (Himalayan honey bee) - the central and eastern Himalayan mountains (Ruttner, 1987) Recent genetic analysis, however, has determined that some of the subspecies described may have been inadvertent misidentifications of very similar sympatric species, including Apis koschevnikovi of Borneo and Apis nigrocincta of the Philippines. Apis cerana nuluensis of Borneo is also now generally considered to be a separate species, as Apis nuluensis. Geographical distribution of the six Apis cerana morphocluster groups (Radloff et al., 2010) Radloff et al. (2010) have instead chosen to subdivide Apis cerana into six main statistically-defined populations based on morphotypes (\\"morphoclusters\\"), instead of infraspecific ranks, which they argue were invalidly established and not biologically meaningful. These morphoclusters are: *Northern cerana (Morphocluster I) - extends from northern Afghanistan and Pakistan to northwest India, southern Tibet, northern Myanmar, China, and into the Korean peninsula, far eastern Russia, and Japan. They can be further subdivided into six subclusters: an \\"Indus\\" group (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir); a \\"Himachali\\" group (Himachal Pradesh, India); an \\"Aba\\" group (larger bees in southern Gansu, central and northern Sichuan, northern China, and Russia); a central and eastern China subcluster; a \\"southern\\" cerana subcluster in southern Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan; and a \\"Japonica\\" subgroup in Japan, North Korea, and South Korea. :*Synonyms: A. skorikovi, A. c. abansis, A. c. abanensis, A. c. bijjieca, A. c. cathayca, A. c. cerana, A. c. fantsun, A. c. hainana, A. c. hainanensis, A. c. heimifeng, A. c. indica, A. c. japonica, A. c. javana, A. c. kweiyanga, A. c. maerkang, A. c. pekinga, A. c. peroni, A. c. skorikovi, A. c. shankianga, and A. c. twolareca *Himalayan cerana (Morphocluster II) - extends from northern India, Tibet, and Nepal.

Can be divided into three subclusters, the \\"Luzon\\" bees, \\"Visayas\\" bees, and \\"Mindanao\\" bees, with the latter two being more closer morphometrically than the \\"Luzon\\" bees. A population is also found in central Sulawesi. :*Synonyms: A. philippina, A. c. philippina, and A. c. samarensis *Indo-Malayan cerana (Morphocluster VI) - extends from southern Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Palawan (the Philippines).

The individuals in this genus are defined by long, erect hairs that cover the compound eyes and assist in pollen collection, strongly convex scutellum, and a jugal lobe in the hindwing. Adult Apis cerana are black in color, with four yellow abdominal stripes. There are also distinctions between worker bees, queens, and drones. Worker bees are characterized by a pollen press on the hind leg to transport pollen, as well as a stinger in the place of an organ for laying eggs. Queens, which are the reproductive females, are typically larger than worker bees due to their enlarged reproductive organs. Drones, which are the males of the species, are defined by larger eyes, lack of a stinger, and a blunter abdominal shape. Distribution and habitat Apis cerana encompass a wide range of climatic zones including moist tropical rainforests, wet-dry tropical savannas, mid-latitude steppes, dry mid-latitude grasslands, moist continental deciduous forests, and taigas. The natural range of Apis cerana extends from Primorsky Krai in Russia in the north, to eastern Indonesia in the south; and to Japan in the east, to as far as the highlands of Afghanistan in the west. Countries they are native to include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. It was introduced deliberately to New Guinea in the 1970s, and has since spread into the Torres Strait Islands into Australia and the Solomon Islands.Koetz A. 2012. Spread of Apis cerana in Australia, 2007 ‚Äì 2012; Asian honey bee Transition to Management Program. Queensland government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Although the species was naturally clustered in East Asia, it has now expanded to various regions across the world as a result of human interference, with particular concern about its invasive potential in Australia as nests are found in a variety of environments, including both natural and man-made (see below). Apis indica.jpg|A. cerana, Nepal Asiatic-honey-bee.jpg|A. cerana, India Apis cerana.jpg|In Thailand Nest As a type of honey bee, Apis cerana must collect and store around a third of its nectar in a concentrated form in order to ensure an adequate supply for consumption during the harsh winter. The nest is multi-combed and somewhat insulated, allowing the species to achieve optimal nest temperatures and thereby optimize foraging at early hours. The nest itself is a simple vertical comb made from wax secreted by workers, while the thermoregulation is generated by fanning and water evaporation from water collected in the field. This large-scale storage tactic requires the construction of a stable and sturdy comb structure for such honey storage. However, as the production of beeswax for a comb is an energetically expensive endeavor, colonies do not generally build the entire structure very early on. Instead, the colony builds a smaller set of combs that satisfies the initial storage needs. Upon moving into the new nest, the colony will then continue to enlarge the combs until there are enough storage units to sufficiently account for all of the required honey. In general, the initial set of combs may account for around 20,000 cells, while the final, completed structure may contain up to 100,000. These nests are typically large enough to host around 6,000 to 7,000 individuals and are found in a wide range of external environments. Nest thermoregulation A. cerana maintains internal hive temperatures with a precision similar to that of A. mellifera, using similar mechanisms. A. cerana maintain body temperatures in a range of 33‚Äì35.5 ¬∞C even while ambient temperatures vary between 12 and 36 ¬∞C. This mechanism clearly shows them to possess effective nest thermoregulation systems. During summer, A. cerana employs evaporative cooling, where the worker bees cluster outside the nest in hot weather and fan their wings, thus removing excess heat and moisture from the nest and decreasing the hive temperature. =Thermal defense= When an A. cerana hive is invaded by the Japanese giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia), about 500 Japanese honey bees (A. cerana japonica) surround the hornet and vibrate their flight muscles until the temperature is raised to 47 ¬∞C (117 ¬∞F), heating the hornet to death, but keeping the temperature still under their own lethal limit (48‚Äì50 ¬∞C). Behavior Colony cycle The colony of Apis cerana, a typical honey bee, consists of several thousand female worker bees, one queen bee, and several hundred male drone bees. The colony is constructed inside beeswax combs inside a tree cavity, with a special peanut-shaped structure on the margins of the combs where the queens are reared.Seeley, Thomas D. The wisdom of the hive: the social physiology of honey bee colonies. Harvard University Press, 2009. The colony's annual cycle in cold temperature regions begins shortly after the winter solstice, when the colony raises the core temperature of its cluster to about 34 degrees Celsius and starts to rear brood. At first, only around 100 bees are produced, but several thousand bees are developing by early spring. By late spring, the colony will have already attained full size, and will begin to reproduce. The colony then rears several new queens, and divides itself with about half the workers plus the old queen once the new queens have nearly matured. This new swarm then flies to a new tree branch, explores nest cavities, and then directs the other bees to the new site once satisfied with the location. During the remainder of summer and into the fall, the colonies in the new locations build combs, rear brood, and gather food to quickly rebuild their populations and food reserves prior to the arrival of winter. Division of labor As a social species, Apis cerana colonies contain divisions of labor depending on what each member of the group is specialized to perform. There is generally only one queen bee whose sole responsibility it is to lay eggs; therefore, she is the mother of all the workers present in the colony. Apart from the queen bee, the remaining female bees are known as the worker bees, as these individuals perform all the tasks necessarily to maintain the hive including tending to the eggs, larvae, and pupae, foraging for food and water, cleaning the facility, and producing honey. These tasks are divided among the female worker bees by a factor of age. The remaining individuals are the males, known as the ‚Äúdrones,‚Äù whose only responsibility is to mate with queen from another colony; therefore, drones are solely produced during the reproductive season. Communication The principal method of communication is the waggle dance, performed primarily when a worker bee discovers a rich source of pollen or nectar and wishes to share this knowledge with her fellow nest-mates. The waggle dance occurs deep inside the colony's hive, where the worker bee performs a brief reenactment of the recent journey to a patch of flowers. Neighboring bees observe and learn this dance and can then follow the same pattern, utilizing the odor of the flowers to fly in a certain path and arrive at the same destination. The bees following the informed worker bee will extend their antennae towards the dancer in order to detect the dance sounds, as the frequency of the bee's antennae closely matches the vibration frequency of its wings. The overall direction and duration of each waggle is closely correlated with the direction and distance from the flower patch being described. Mating behavior Within the honey bee colony, a queen bee typically mates with 10 or more males. This extensive mating is performed in an effort to secure a great range of genetic variation in her colony to cope with diseases, as well as respond to nectar sources and a wide range of external stimuli. Apart from the queen bee, the only other sexual members of the society are the male drones, whose only function is to mate with the queen, after which they will die. The exact time and place of Apis cerana mating is specific to the subspecies, often varying by local environment. For instance, in Sri Lanka, Apis cerana males typically aggregate beside a tree canopy as opposed to above a tree as is found in the Apis cerana subspecies of Japan. The most significant factor in determining mating time, however, is not ecological conditions, but rather the presence of drones of other species. Mating time decreases as the number of non-species drones present increases. Reproductive swarming In A. cerana, reproductive swarming is similar to A. mellifera. A. cerana reproductive swarms settle 20‚Äì30 m away from the natal nest (the mother or primary colony) and stay for a few days before departing for a new nest site after getting information from scout bees. Scout bees search for suitable cavities in which to construct the swarm's home. Successful scouts come back and report the location of suitable nesting sites to the other bees by performing communication dances on the surface of the swarm cluster in the same way as for food sources. = Absconding behavior = Apart from reproductive swarming, A. cerana has migration and absconding behavior, abandoning the current nest and building a new nest in a new location where an abundant supply of nectar and pollen is available. These bees usually do not store great amounts of honey, so they are more vulnerable to starvation if a prolonged shortage of nectar and pollen occurs. Absconding will start when not enough pollen and nectar are available. After the last brood emerges, the adult bees fill their honey stomachs from the hive's stores and swarm to establish a new nest at a new location. A. cerana has more absconding behavior than A. mellifera. Life history The development of worker bees in a colony is typical of that for any insect that undergoes complete metamorphosis as it includes the four stages of egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The embryo grows inside the egg for 3 days, consuming the protein-rich egg yolk. Then it undergoes an 8-day larval stage, which is an intense feeding state involving honey, pollen, and brood food supplied by the adult bees. Finally, there is construction of a wax pupa which then matures and gnaws through the wax cap of the cell to emerge as a young bee. Kin selection Genetic relatedness within colonies As one queen generally mates with over a dozen males, the genetic relatedness of the colony is biased and represents haplodiploid sex determination. If the queen bee lays unfertilized eggs with no paternal genetic contribution, the eggs will develop into drones. If the queen bee lays fertilized eggs with both maternal and paternal genetic contribution, the eggs will develop into females. In this system, virgin queens sharing the same father will have a genetic relatedness of .75 and those of different fathers will have a genetic relatedness of only .25. The females workers in the colony are related to the queen's sons by a genetic relatedness of .25. Such biasing results in the genes of some female worker bees being represented disproportionately in the virgin queens. Worker-queen conflict Conflict may arise between workers and bees as female workers attempt to increase the propagation of their genes by biasing their queen-rearing efforts in favor of virgin queens sharing the same father. Although female worker bees do possess ovaries and can essentially produce viable eggs, this potential is almost never realized as long as the colony is ruled by a dominant queen. Therefore, the probability of personal reproduction by a worker bee is exceedingly low. ‚ÄúWorker policing,‚Äù which is the mutual prevention of reproduction by workers, could be the reason behind the conscious non-reproduction of female worker bees. In other words, their fertility is controlled by queen signals. The queen honey bee informs workers of her presence by pheromones that she secretes from her mandibular glands. These signals are acquired by workers in close proximity to the queen and then spread to other workers in the colony, mainly by physical contact. In the presence of queen pheromone signals, the vast majority of workers refrain from activating their ovaries. Due to factors of genetic relatedness, an Apis cerana worker will often try to prevent other workers in her colony from reproducing, either by destroying worker-laid eggs, or by showing aggression towards workers attempting to lay eggs through worker policing. Interaction with other species Diet Adult worker bees predominantly feed on pollen and nectar or honey, though the nutritive value of pollen varies depending on the plant. Mixed pollens possess a high nutritive value and actually supply all the necessary materials for proper development of young animals. However, when dried, pollen quickly loses its nutritive value. In addition to feeding themselves, bees also feed each other through a process known as ‚Äúfood transmission.‚Äù Moreover, workers may also obtain food from the queen, while drones acquire food by ingesting material regurgitated by other drones. Queens themselves are fed larval food by the workers during their wintering season, thereby neither feeding on nor being fed honey. Water requirement In addition to food requirements for diet, water also plays a key role in the growth and development of adult bees. In fact, the form of food has little to no influence on the longevity and life expectancy of the bee as long as there is still ready availability of water. This idea was further supported through experimental means concerning queen bees isolated in separate cages. Both groups were fed sugar candy as a control measure; however, the group that was fed water in addition to the sugar candy lived an average of two weeks or more compared to the other group which only survived a matter of three to four days. Moreover, the importance of water intake for an adult bee's survival can be further understood through examination of diet and behavior during prime seasons, during which colonies of bees consume large amounts of water in order to dilute honey produced as well as to regulate temperature in the nest. Predators Vespine wasps, endemic to Southeast Asia, are a major predator for Apis cerana, predominantly at their colonies throughout Southern Asia. This hawking predation is especially fierce during the autumn season when the wasps are most populous, predominantly during the morning and afternoon. This method involves the wasps taking up a position in front of the beehive, while facing outwards away from the entrance towards returning foragers.Tan, Ken, et al. \\"Bee-hawking by the wasp, Vespa velutina, on the honeybees Apis cerana and A. mellifera.\\" Naturwissenschaften 94.6 (2007): 469-472. Vespine wasps attempt to attack the honey bee quarry in an effort to gain provisions to aid in the development of their own offspring. Defense As the Vespine wasps approach the entrance to the honey bee nest, more guard bees are alerted, which in turn increases their probability of being killed by heat-balling bees. Heat balling is a unique defense system in which several hundred bees surround the wasp in a tight ball and vibrate their muscles in an effort to produce heat and effectively kill the wasp inside. Alternatively, however, in the presence of a wasp, the bees may also just withdraw into their nests and await the heat- balling circumstances to develop naturally. Furthermore, other bees may just decide to fly away as an evasive measure in times of conflict, often altering their specific flight styles in order to avoid predation.  Thermal defense  When an A. cerana hive is invaded by the Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia), about 500 Japanese honey bees (A. cerana japonica) surround the hornet and vibrate their flight muscles until the temperature is raised to 47 ¬∞C (117 ¬∞F), heating the hornet to death, but keeping the temperature still under their own lethal limit (48‚Äì50 ¬∞C). Wing shimmering Although both Apis mellifera and Apis cerana suffer from predation from vespine wasps, one defense mechanism unique to Apis cerana is ‚Äúwing shimmering‚Äù. During this period of self-defense, bees collectively execute carefully timed waves of shimmering of their wings when approached by predators such as vespine wasps. This appears to serve as a distraction technique of visual pattern disruption that results in confusing predators. As a result, predators are unable to continue attacking additional bees. Pathogens and parasites affecting Apis cerana Microsporidia. Apis cerana is the natural host to the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae, a serious pest of the western honey bee.Ritter, Wolfgang Nosema ceranae Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg When first discovered near Beijing, China, in 1994, it was originally thought that Nosema ceranae was restricted to Apis cerana within in the East Asian region.Paxton, Robert J., et al. \\"Nosema ceranae has infected Apis mellifera in Europe since at least 1998 and may be more virulent than Nosema apis.\\"Apidologie 38.6 (2007): 558-565. However, it has now been confirmed that this parasite species is actually present in colonies of Apis mellifera as well, both in Taiwan as well as Spain, though the origins of its arrival in Europe are still unknown. Bees infected with Nosema ceranae suffer reduced lifespans as well as increased mortality in the winter and poor buildup and reduced honey yield in the spring. Mites. Apis cerana has also coevolved with the mite Varroa jacobsoni and thus exhibits more careful grooming than A. mellifera, thus has an effective defense mechanism against Varroa that keeps the mite from devastating colonies. Other than defensive behaviors such as these, much of their behavior and biology (at least in the wild) is very similar to that of A. mellifera. Viruses. Asian honey bees (Apis cerana) are often infected by Chinese Sacbrood virus (CSBV) which also infects A. mellifera. Sacbrood viruses (SBV) primarily affect the brood of the honey bee and causes larval death.W. Ritter, Diagnostik und Bekampfung von Bienenkrankheiten, Gustav Fischer Verlag Jena, Stuttgart, Germany, 1996. Infected larvae fail to pupate, and ecdysial fluid aggregates around the integument, forming the ‚Äúsac‚Äù for which the disease is named. Infected larvae change in color from pearly white to pale yellow, and shortly after death they dry out, forming a dark brown gondola-shaped scale.L. Bailey, ‚ÄúRecent research on honeybee viruses,‚Äù Bee World, vol. 56, pp. 55‚Äì64, 1975. SBV may also affect the adult bee, but in this case obvious signs of disease are lacking.L. Bailey, ‚ÄúThe multiplication and spread of sacbrood virus of bees,‚Äù Annals of Applied Biology, vol. 63, no. 3, pp. 483‚Äì491, 1969. An invasive species in Australia Apis cerana was first detected in Australia in 2007. By 2012, it had spread across 500,000 hectares.Koetz A. 2012. Spread of Apis cerana in Australia, 2007 ‚Äì 2012; Asian honey bee Transition to Management Program. Queensland government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The impacts of Apis cerana on the Australian environment are not well known due to limited research. However, according to Biosecurity Queensland (2103), the Apis cerana \\"is likely to compete for pollen and nectar with native birds, mammals and insects, and for nesting sites in tree crevices\\".Biosecurity Queensland. 2013. Asian honey bees in Queensland. http://www.daff.qld.gov.au/animal-industries/bees/diseases-and- pests/asian-honey-bees; retrieved 2017-05-28 There is a strong possibility that Apis cerana will also compete for resources with commercial honey bees and affect primary producers who rely on their pollination services. Control costs are also significant and amounted to at least up to 2011.Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. 2011, Communique: National group supports work of Asian Honeybee Coordination Group. 19 July 2011 Efforts to eradicate Apis cerana in Australia have failed. Although an eradication program commenced in 2007, a decision that it was not possible to eradicate the Apis cerana was made in 2011. The decision was controversial though, sparking a senate inquiry which concluded that it failed to apply the precautionary principle and assess the potential impacts of Apis cerana on biodiversity.The Senate Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee; 2011; Science underpinning the inability to eradicate the Asian honey bee; Commonwealth of Australia The bee is known as the Asian honey bee in Australia, and is regarded as a biosecurity threat. Genetic database The Biomodeling Laboratory at Seoul National University had as of 2015 constructed an Asian honey bee transcriptome database using an advanced sequencing technique.

History The name is given as 'North Skelmoirluy' on Robert Gordon's map of 1636‚Äì52; 'Skelmurly' on John Adair's map of 1685; and 'Skelmorly' on William Roy's map of 1745‚Äì47. The origin of the name may be 'shelter leeside of the great rock' and 'Skel-' may be equivalent to 'Skeir' and 'Skerries.'Johnston, Page 267 The Cunninghame family During the reign of Robert III (1390‚Äì1406) the lands of Skelmorlie were held by the Cunninghames of Kilmaurs; in about 1460 the northern portion passed into the hands of the Montgomeries as Skelmorlie-Montgomerie, the remainder continuing as Skelmorlie-Cunninghame.Millar, Page 134 Anne, sister of Alexander de Montgomerie married a Cunninghame of Kilmaurs and this may explain the division of the lands.Smart, Page 13 The Montgomerie family The Lairds or Barons On 6 June 1461 Sir Alexander de Montgomerie of Ardrossan, the first Lord Montgomerie, granted the lands of Skelmorlie to his second son by Margaret Boyd (daughter of Sir Thomas Boyd of Kilmarnock), George, thereby was the founder of the cadet branch, the Montgomeries of Skelmorlie. George was also granted the lands of Lochliboside, Hartfield, and Colpy in the Barony of Renfrew.Paterson, Page 534 Another view is that Skelmorlie Castle was built by a brother of Hugh, the first Earl of Eglinton. This Hugh was the son of the second Lord Montgomerie and the grandson of the first Lord Montgomerie. John was the second laird and he married Marion Dalzel, by whom he had a son, Cuthbert, the third laird.Fullarton, Page 101 Cuthbert married Elizabeth, daughter of Patrick Houston of that Ilk and their eldest son George became the fourth laird. George married Lady Catherine Montgomerie, youngest daughter of Hugh, first Earl of Eglinton. They had a large family and the eldest, Thomas, became the fifth laird. Thomas died in 1566 and his brother Robert inherited Skelmorlie, as well as Lochransay, Synnock, and Lochliboside.Fullarton, Page 102 Robert Montgomerie, seventh laird, was knighted by James VI and in 1628 created a baronet by Charles I. He was the son of another Robert; his mother was Dorothy, daughter of Lord Sempill. This Sir Robert married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Douglas of Drumlanrig. The sixth laird, Robert, murdered Alexander Cunninghame, commendator of Kilwinning Abbey at his castle and palace of Montgreenan in 1586, following the murder, by the Cunninghames, of the fourth Earl of Eglinton. The elder Sir Robert and his eldest son where in revenge killed by Patrick Maxwell of Newark Glasgow.Dobie, Page 343 The Baronets Newark Castle, Port Glasgow. Sir Robert, the seventh laird and first baronet, was one day discovered by Patrick Maxwell in Newark Castle; presumably also bent on revenge for his father and brother. Patrick is recorded as saying Come down Robin, out o' that corner, come down, man, to me, who did you so good a turn as to make you young laird and auld laird o' Skelmorlie in one day. Patrick and Sir Robert in fact became friends. Sir Robert married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Douglas of Drumlanrig. She was a famous beauty and the subject of ballads by Alexander Montgomerie of Hessilhead.Fullarton, Page 107 The third baronet and ninth laird, Sir Robert, married Antonia, co-heiress of Sir James Scott of Rossie in Fife, by whom he had four sons and four daughters. This lady was an ardent covenanter and her husband was repeatedly fined for her attendance at conventicles. Robert died in 1685 and was succeeded by his son James. They had seven sons and four daughters. Sir James, fourth baronet and tenth laird, was a member of the 1689 Parliament and Convention, like his father Robert. It is recorded that his mother wrote in 1684, severely chastising him for not providing for her and her four fatherless children. He was one of those chosen to administer the oath (the offer of the Crown) to King William and Queen Mary in London. He was dissatisfied with his reward of Lord Justice-Clerk and become a supporter of the deposed King James II, joining him at St Germains in France; despite this support Sir James, a Protestant, was not fully welcome by the Catholic King James and despite a promise to create him Earl of Ayr, he died, of 'vexation', in September 1694 in London. He had married Lady Margaret Johnston, daughter of a co-conspirator, the Earl of Annandale They had two sons, Robert the elder and William.Paterson, Page 535Fullarton, Page 109 Eglinton Castle, built by the 12th Earl of Eglinton. The Lord Provost of Glasgow, Hugh Montgomerie of Busbie, purchased the estate from the fourth baronet; taking possession in 1731 and inheriting the title as 6th baronet and eleventh laird. In 1687 he married Lilias Gemmel, daughter of Peter Gemmel, merchant in Glasgow and Christian Boyd his wife. Hugh was one of the commissioners appointed to negotiate the union with England, serving as a member of Scotland's last parliament. He was appointed to the first parliament of the United Kingdom as the representative for Glasgow.Fullarton, Pages 110‚Äì111 Hugh died in 1735 without issue and being the last direct descendant, the title became extinct. The Skelmorlie estate passed to the 4th baron's daughter, Lilias, who married Alexander Montgomerie of Coilsfield. Lilias's son Hugh became the 12th Earl of Eglinton and his brother held the property of Annick Lodge. Lilias had five sons and three daughters and died in 1783, a few weeks before her husband. She sold her lands in Renfrewshire and purchased lands contiguous with Skelmorlie.

He spent many nights praying for his salvation in the vault.Leighton, Page 220 His lead coffin carries the inscription (translated from the Latin) ‚Äì I was dead before myself; I anticipated my proper funeral; alone, of all mortals, following the example of Caesar.MacIntosh, Page 278 This Caesar was Charles V who had his obsequies carried out before his death. This unusual inscriptions may be explained by his habit of praying alone in the burial vault for excessively long periods of time, as if he was already 'dead' and occupying his tomb.Dobie, Page 342 A story is told of a local warlock bringing the Devil along with him to do a mischief to Sir Robert, however the laird was deep in prayer as usual and the Devil was forced to give up on his evil intent.Fullarton, Page 104 A stylised view of Skelmorlie Castle is seen in one of the painted panels on the ceiling of the aisle.MacIntosh, Page 281 The castle and grounds The castle from the southeast in the 1880s. The castle frontage from the northeast in the 1880s. The frontage from the northeast, 2014. The original Skelmorlie Castle may have stood on a motte which is situated in a defensive position on a promontory on ground lying between a small burn and the Skelmorlie Water at NS 213 660. The oldest portion of the present day castle was built in 1502 and added to in 1636, when corbelling and parapets were removed, whilst angle turrets, later roofed, were added.Millar, Page 134Campbell, Page 245RCAHMS. Accessed : 2009-12-30 Timothy Pont in his survey of Cunninghame around the year 1600 describes Skelmorlie Castle as \\"a fair well built house. It is certainly, in point of situation, a very pleasant and most delightful place, with its old-fashioned gardens, terrace and shrubbery. The view from it over the Firth of Clyde, to the opposite islands of Bute, Arran and Cumbraes, is not to be surpassed in picturesque scenery by any prospect in Britain\\". The baronial hall was on the first floor and as a more modern day dining room it had the Montgomerie coat of arms on the roof with the date 1762. The castle chapel, converted in the 19th century to stables and servants' quarters, still stands at the western side of the southern courtyard. Sir Robert's 17th range survives in part. Skelmorlie tower is very similar in dimensions and internal arrangements to those towers at Little Cumbrae, Fairlie, and Law.McGibbon, Page 174 The grounds in the early 19th century are described as \\"beautifully laid out, and covered with rich and luxuriant woods. The principal disadvantage of this fine old mansion, as a modern residence, is certainly the difficulty of ascent to it, from the steepness of the hill on which it stands; but otherwise an agreeable, nay, delightful summer retreat.\\" In the 1855 OS survey a bowling green and a sundial, possibly a Scottish sundial, are shown. The old baronial mill still exists in the name 'Milnburn' close to the Skelmorlie Water and Skelmorlie Mains is marked. The silhouette of the keep has remained largely unchanged for over five centuries. This red sandstone rubble construction was rough-cast harled in the early 1960s following a fire in 1959, which burnt out the upper floors of the keep and of the west wing. The wing was demolished and the keep restored; the architects were Noad and Wallace of Glasgow. Historic Scotland listed Skelmorlie Castle and the separate subsidiary buildings (17th Century Turret House and former Chapel, and Victorian Mews) on the south side of the southern courtyard as \\"Category B\\" in 1971. Occupants since the 19th century Archibald William in 1921, the first Earl to have inherited the title whilst dwelling at Skelmorlie Castle. Major-General James Montgomerie, of Wrighthill, M.P. for Ayrshire lived at the castle for a long period in the early 19th century, being the brother of the 12th earl and grand-uncle to the 13th earl.Leighton, Page 219 During this time the castle remained as a little altered, but run down example of a tower castle. The castle was tenanted during the period 1852 to 1890 by John Graham (1797‚Äì1886) of Glasgow, a textile and Port wine merchant (W. & J. Graham & Co. of Oporto established 1820), who was also a great patron of the Arts with an outstanding collection. He rebuilt the castle in 1856 by restoring the old tower at his own expense, and adding the mansion house which joined two old buildings, with the permission of the Earl of Eglinton.McGibbon, Page 183 His architect was William Railton of Kilmarnock.Love (2003), Page 8 The 16th Earl of Eglinton moved here from the abandoned Eglinton Castle Montgomerie family seat in the mid-1920s, but it was sold by the 18th Earl of Eglinton, having been leased to the Wilson family since 1956. The 16th Earl died at Skelmorlie Castle in 1945.Strawhorn, Page 202 The castle became the property of the Wilson family in the mid-1970s, also the owners of the meat canning factory at Eglinton Castle, Kilwinning.Eglinton Archive The castle was advertised for sale in 2007Guardian Newspaper Accessed : 2010-01-10 and passed to new private owners in the summer of 2009.

A Professor at the University of California Berkeley, Main is particularly known for her introduction of the 'disorganized' infant attachment classification and for development of the Adult Attachment Interview and coding system for assessing states of mind regarding attachment. This work has been described as 'revolutionary'University of Gothenburg (2007). Honorary doctorate for Mary Main.

Honorary doctorate awarded to Prof. Mary Main. Available at:  Early work  John Bowlby originally proposed the concept of the 'attachment behavioral system', an orientation and set of dispositions which evolved because it provided protection from predation and other risks to survival. The system has three components in early childhood: the monitoring and maintaining of proximity to an attachment figure or figures, flight to these individuals as a haven of safety in times of alarm, and use of these individuals as a secure base for exploration. A collaborator of Bowlby's, Mary Ainsworth, developed a standardised laboratory observation procedure named the 'Strange Situation' in which an infant would undergo two brief separations and reunions from their caregiver as well as contact with a stranger. In its novelty and its separations, the Strange Situation confronted the infant with two natural cues for danger, and allowed observers to see the articulation and balance between the infant's capacities to explore, affiliate with the stranger, and seek and find comfort from their caregiver. Individual differences in infant responses to the situation were found and three patterns were identified: secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-ambivalent.Main, M. (2000). The organized categories of infant, child, and adult attachment: Flexible vs. inflexible attention under attachment-related stress, Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 48(4), 1055-1096, p.1093. Mary Main was among the first doctoral students of Mary Ainsworth's at The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, exploring the relationship between attachment and infant play in her doctoral research. Main found that infants who were securely attached to their mothers engaged in more exploration and interactive play. Important aspects of Main's early work also included microanalysis of infant-mother interaction using descriptive language rather than count data,Brazelton, T., Kozlowski, B., & Main, M. (1974). The origins of reciprocity. In: M. Lewis & L.A. Rosenblum (Eds.), The effects of the infant on its caregiver (pp. 49-76). New York: Wiley-Interscience. replicating her teacher Mary Ainsworth's Strange Situation on a different sample,Main, M., & Weston, D. (1981). The quality of the toddler's relationship to mother and to father: Related to conflict behavior and the readiness to establish new relationships. Child Development, 52(3): 932-940 and work on the scale for avoidant infant behavior. Insecure- avoidance is coded using a 1‚Äì7 scale for 'avoidance', which Mary Ainsworth and Mary Main worked on together. Whereas infants classified as secure would seek their caregiver on reunion, show their distress, and receive comfort, 'avoidance' was a measure of the extent to which an infant kept their attention away from their caregiver and avoided showing their distress. Main conceptualised avoidance as a 'conditional behavioral strategy'. Whilst it might seem odd or maladaptive at first sight for a child to turn away from their caregiver when anxious, Main argued from an evolutionary perspective that avoidance could be regarded as a strategy to achieve the protective proximity enjoined by the attachment system - but which responds to the context of a caregiver who would rebuff them and be less available if the infant made a direct appeal for contact and comfort.Main, M. (1977). The ultimate causation of some infant attachment phenomena. Behavioral and Brain Science, 2: 640-643. Following completion of her dissertation, Main took up a faculty position in the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. She has since remained at Berkeley, though she has also held visiting scholar positions at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Bielefeld (Germany) and the University of Leiden (Netherlands). During her year with Karin and Klaus Grossmann at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in 1977, Main interacted with various biologists, evolutionary theorists and ethologists, including Richard Dawkins and Robert Hinde, who influenced her thinking. In a letter to Behavioral and Brain Science, 1977, the ground in evolutionary theory upon which Main's later ideas emerged is already clear. In this text, she draws from Tinbergen the important distinction between 'proximal' and 'ultimate' causation, noting that immense confusion about attachment arises when these levels of analysis are mistaken for one another. In inquiring about the proximate cause of behavior, an attachment researcher may ask \\"What made him show attachment behavior toward it at this particular moment?\\" In inquiring about the ultimate cause of behavior, an attachment researcher may ask \\"What is attachment behavior good for ‚Äì how does it affect survival and reproduction?\\"Main, M. (1977). The ultimate causation of some infant attachment phenomena. Behavioral and Brain Science, 2: 640-643. In her attention to attachment as an evolutionary phenomenon, from early in her career Main was already reflecting that a conflict might arise between an infant's experience of aversive parenting and the attachment injunction to seek protection from a caregiver:  Disorganized attachment  In 1986 Mary Main, together with Jude Cassidy, introduced a new infant attachment classification, 'disorganized/disoriented' (D), for the Ainsworth Strange Situation procedureMain, M., & Solomon, J. (1986). Discovery of a new, insecure-disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern. In M. Yogman & T. B. Brazelton (Eds.), Affective development in infancy (pp. 95‚Äì124). Norwood, NJ: Ablex. based on a review of discrepant infant behaviors in the Strange Situation. Michael Rutter, a prominent commentator on attachment research, has described the discovery of the disorganized/disoriented attachment classification as one of the five great advances to the field of psychology contributed by research in attachment.Rutter, M., Kreppner, J., & Sonuga-Barke, E. (2009). Emmanuel Miller Lecture: Attachment insecurity, disinhibited attachment, and attachment disorders: Where do the research findings leave the concepts? Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 50(5), 529-543. In general, disorganized behaviors occur only briefly, before the infant then enters back into one of the Ainsworth A, B or C attachment patterns. As such, infants coded as disorganized/disoriented are also given a secondary A, B or C classification.Lyons-Ruth, K., & Jacobvitz, D. (2008). Attachment disorganization: Genetic factors, parenting contexts, and developmental transformation from infancy to adulthood. In J. Cassidy & P.R. Shaver (Eds.), Handbook of attachment: Theory, research and clinical applications (2nd ed., pp.666-697). New York: McGraw-Hill. The discrepant behaviors are most often exhibited on reunion, but are found in other episodes of the procedure as well. Main and Cassidy developed a set of thematic headings for the various forms of disorganized/disoriented behavior. Infant behaviors coded as disorganized/disoriented include sequential display of contradictory behavior patterns (Index I); simultaneous display of contradictory behavior patterns (II); undirected, misdirected, incomplete, and interrupted movements and expressions (III); stereotypies, asymmetrical movements, mistimed movements, and anomalous postures (IV); freezing, stilling, and slowed movements and expressions (V); direct indices of apprehension regarding the parent (VI); direct indices of disorganization or disorientation (VII).Main, M., & Solomon, J. (1990). Procedures for identifying infants as disorganized/disoriented during the Ainsworth Strange Situation. In M.T. Greenberg, D. Cicchetti & E.M. Cummings (Eds.), Attachment in the preschool years: Theory, research and intervention (pp. 121-160). Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Like the Ainsworth classifications, 'disorganized/disoriented attachment' with one caregiver little predicts the classification with another caregiver. This implies that the classification is tapping a quality of the relationship, and not merely the child's temperament.van IJzendoorn, M. H., Schuengel, C., & Bakermans-Kranenburg, M. J. (1999). Disorganized attachment in early childhood: Meta-analysis of precursors, concomitants, and sequelae, Development and Psychopathology, 11, 225‚Äì249. A classification of disorganized/disoriented attachment has been found to be a risk factor for later development.Sroufe, L. A., Carlson, E. A., Levy, A. K., & Egeland, B. (1999). Implications of attachment theory for developmental psychopathology, Development and Psychopathology, 11, 1‚Äì13. For example, this classification in infancy has been found associated with school- age externalising problem behavior,van IJzendoorn, M. H., Schuengel, C., & Bakermans-Kranenburg, M. J. (1999).

(2008). Longitudinal association between infant disorganized attachment and childhood posttraumatic stress symptoms, Development and Psychopathology, 20(2), 493‚Äì508. Behaviors associated with disorganization have been found to undergo transformation from the age of 2 and typically develop into various forms of well-organised controlling behavior toward the parent. Some children are overly solicitous and protective toward the parent (classified by Main and Cassidy as controlling-caregiving) while others are harshly directive or rudely humiliating toward the parent (classified controlling-punitive).Main, M., & Cassidy, J.

Disorganized attachment in early childhood: Meta-analysis of precursors, concomitants, and sequelae, Development and Psychopathology, 11(2), 225‚Äì249. Main conceptualised disorganization/disorientation as representing some form of contradiction or disruption of the attachment system: either a conflict between simultaneous dispositions to physically approach and to flee the caregiver, or seeming disorientation to the environment.Duschinsky, R. (2015). The emergence of the disorganized/disoriented (D) attachment classification, 1979-1982, History of Psychology 18(1): 32‚Äì46. Other researchers have suggested that the dysregulation of negative affects can lead to disorganized behavior, even without a specific paradoxical injunction.Bernier, A., & Meins, E. (2008). A threshold approach to understanding the origins of attachment disorganization, Developmental Psychology, 44(4), 969-982; DeOliveira, C.A., Bailey, H.N., Moran, G., & Pederson, D.R. (2004).

(2013). Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity: distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal, Attachment & Human Development, 15(5-6), 562-582 However, it is important to note that Main and Solomon did not intend to suggest that all of the behaviors used as indices of disorganization/disorientation ‚Äì some kind of disruption at the level of the attachment system ‚Äì necessarily mean the same thing in the same way for infant attachment or infant mental health.Duschinsky, R. (2015). The emergence of the disorganized/disoriented (D) attachment classification, 1979-1982, History of Psychology, 18(1): 32‚Äì46. This point has been little recognised. As Lyons-Ruth et al. have recently observed, with concern, \\"to date, few hypotheses have been advanced regarding the mechanisms underlying this striking difference among infants who display disorganized behavior\\".Lyons-Ruth, K., Bureau, J.-F., Easterbrooks, M., Obsuth, I., Hennighausen, K., & Vulliez-Coady, L. (2013). Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity: distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal, Attachment & Human Development, 15(5-6), 562-582 The researchers note that this inattention to mechanisms may be masking important differences and potentially limiting the precision of clinical and welfare interventions. Among the behaviors classified as D, only behavior which appears dissociative has been systematically examined.Liotti, G. (1992). Disorganized/disoriented attachment in the etiology of the dissociative disorders, Dissociation, 5(4): 196-204; Main, M., & Morgan, H. (1996). Disorganization and disorientation in infant strange situation behavior: Phenotypic resemblance to dissociative states? In L. Michelson & W. Ray (Eds.), Handbook of dissociation: Theoretical, empirical and clinical perspectives (pp. 107‚Äì138). New York: Plenum  Disorganized attachment and caregiving  After the initial presentation of protocols for coding D Strange Situation behavior in infants by Main and Solomon, researchers have explored the caregiving behavior associated with the classification. Together with Erik Hesse, in 1990 Main proposed that disorganized attachment behavior can be explained by a contradiction between the attachment system and another behavioral tendency. As the attachment system demands that the infant seek protection from the attachment figure when alarmed: \\"an infant who is frightened by the attachment figure is presented with a paradoxical problem ‚Äì namely, an attachment figure who is at once the source of and the solution to its alarm.\\"Main, M., & Hesse, E. (1990). Parents' unresolved traumatic experiences are related to infant disorganized attachment status. In M.T. Greenberg, D. Cicchetti & E.M. Cummings (Eds.) Attachment in the Preschool Years (pp.161-181), Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p.163. A parent who frightens the child with abusive behavior, or who themselves is frightened when the child seeks comfort because of past trauma, could be supposed to cause such a paradox for an infant. Research has supported this proposed association between frightening and frightened parental behavior and the infant's classification as D in the Strange Situation.Schuengel, C., Bakermans-Kranenburg, M. J., & van IJzendoorn, M. H. (1999). Frightening maternal behavior linking unresolved loss and disorganized infant attachment, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 67, 54 ‚Äì 63. The image of parental frightening behavior as a causal pathway to disorganized infant attachment has captured the imagination of clinicians and social workers, and has sometimes led to the misuse of the concept of disorganized/disoriented attachment in screening for maltreatment. However, Main and Hesse have stated that they intended their emphasis on frightening or frightened caregiver behavior as \\"one highly specific and sufficient, but not necessary, pathway to D attachment status.\\"Hesse, E., & Main, M. (2006). Frightened, threatening, and dissociative behavior in low-risk samples: Description, discussion and interpretations, Development and Psychopathology, 18, 309-343. Main and Hesse do not assume that fear in relation to the caregiver is always the proximate cause of disorganized/disoriented attachment behavior. This account has been supported by research findings which show that a range of factors can predict this behavior besides abuse and neglect. For example, unresolved loss,Hesse, E., & Main, M. (2000). Disorganized infant, child, and adult attachment: Collapse in Behavioral and attentional strategies, Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 48(4), 1097-1127. parental experiences of helplessness,George, S., & Solomon, J.

(2011). The Disorganized Attachment-Caregiving System. In Judith Solomon & Carol George (Eds.), Disorganized attachment & caregiving (pp. 25‚Äì51), NY: Guilford Press. have also been found to predict infant disorganized attachment behavior. Out-of-home caregiving is not associated with disorganized attachment unless this is extremely extensive. Researchers have found that over 60 hours per week of day-care predicts disorganized attachment in the infant independently of the caregiver's behavior during the time they do interact.Hazen, N., Sydnye, D.A., Christopher, C., Umemura, T., & Jacobvitz, D. (2015). Very extensive nonmaternal care predicts mother‚Äìinfant attachment disorganization, Development & Psychopathology, 27(3): 649-661 Though it may be of interest to clinicians and social workers, the variety of reasons why non-maltreating parenting may be associated with infant disorganized/disoriented attachment is an important reason why it is not appropriate to use disorganized attachment as a screening tool for abuse.Main, M., Hesse, E., & Hesse, S. (2011). Attachment theory and research: Overview with suggested applications to child custody, Family Court Review, 49(3), 426‚Äì463 An additional issue for attempts at home screening of disorganized attachment is Main's finding that some infants classified as insecure-avoidant in the strange situation may show disorganized-type behaviors at home.Main, M., & Stadtman, J. (1981). Infant Response to Rejection of Physical Contact by the Mother, Journal of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry, 20(2): 292‚Äì307. Interventions aimed at reducing disorganization have been developed, for example, the Circle of Security Intervention and the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention. The Circle of Security intervention provides group-based psychotherapy and attachment theory-based education to parents. Research examining the effectiveness of the intervention found significant changes from disorganized classifications pre-intervention to organised classifications immediately post-intervention.Hoffman, K., Marvin, R., Cooper, G., & Powell, B. (2006). Changing toddlers and preschoolers' attachment classifications: The Circle of Security intervention, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 74(6), 1017-1026. The ABC intervention aims to enhance caregiving sensitivity and decrease frightening behavior. Results of a randomized clinical trial found higher attachment security and lower attachment disorganization in the intervention group than the control group, suggesting this intervention is effective.Bernard, K., Dozier, M., Bick, J., Lewis-Morrarty, E., Lindhiem, O., & Carlson, E. (2012). Enhancing attachment organization among maltreated children: Results of a randomized clinical trial, Child Development, 83(2), 623-636.  Adult states of mind regarding attachment  Mary Main is also co-author of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI).George, C., Kaplan, N., & Main, M. (1984). Adult Attachment Interview protocol. Unpublished manuscript, University of California at Berkeley. This semi-structured interview consists of 20 questions and takes about one hour to administer. During the interview, participants are asked to describe early childhood experiences with primary attachment figures and evaluate the impact of these experiences on their development.Hesse, E. (2008). The Adult Attachment Interview: Protocol, method of analysis, and empirical studies. In J. Cassidy & P.R. Shaver (Eds.), Handbook of attachment: Theory, research and clinical applications (2nd ed., pp.552-598). New York: McGraw-Hill. An illustrative copy of the Adult Attachment Interview Protocol is available. In research conducted in the early 1980s with parents from a Berkeley sample, Main and colleagues found that transcribed responses to the AAI could be placed into one of three categories, named 'secure-autonomous', 'dismissing' and 'preoccupied'.Main, M., Kaplan, N., & Cassidy, J. (1985). Security in infancy, childhood and adulthood: A move to the level of representation. In I. Bretherton & E. Waters (Eds.), Growing points of attachment theory and research. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 50 (1-2, Serial No. 209), 66-104. Interviews categorised as secure-autonomous are characterised by their coherent and collaborative nature. The interviewees appear to be balanced and objective in their descriptions and evaluations of relationships and overall seem to value attachment. Interviews categorised as dismissing are characterised by inconsistent descriptions and evaluations of relationships. The interviewees may claim to have had positive attachment relationships and experiences but provide unconvincing or contradictory evidence to support this, or acknowledge negative experiences but insist these experiences have had little effect or only made them stronger. Interviews categorised as preoccupied are characterised by angry, vague, confused, or fearful fixation on particular attachment relationships or experiences. Unlike the Strange Situation which assesses an infant's attachment security to a particular person, the Adult Attachment Interview does not assess attachment security with respect to any specific past or current relationship, but instead an individual's overall state of mind with respect to attachment. To illustrate the difference, Main has described how an individual who has no living family and no current romantic partner ‚Äì so a person without a secure attachment in the present to any living persons ‚Äì could be found to have a secure-autonomous state of mind with respect to attachment.Main, M. (2000). The organized categories of infant, child, and adult attachment: Flexible vs. inflexible attention under attachment-related stress, Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 48(4), 1055-1096. In their research with their Berkeley sample in the early 1980s, Main and colleagues also found that the three classifications of adult discourse they had identified correlated with the Ainsworth classifications of infant Strange Situation behavior.Main, M., Kaplan, N., & Cassidy, J. (1985). Security in infancy, childhood and adulthood: A move to the level of representation. In I. Bretherton & E. Waters (Eds.), Growing points of attachment theory and research. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 50 (1-2, Serial No. 209), 66-104. Secure-autonomous adult responses were associated with secure infant behavior towards the speaker, dismissing responses with insecure-avoidant infant behavior towards the speaker and preoccupied responses with insecure-ambivalent infant behavior towards the speaker. How a parent spoke about their own attachment history was therefore found to be associated with their infant's attachment behavior towards them in the Strange Situation, and subsequent research has replicated this finding.van IJzendoorn, M. (1995) Adult attachment representations, parental responsiveness, and infant attachment: A meta-analysis on the predictive validity or the Adult Attachment Interview, Psychological Bulletin, 117(3), 387-403. The association has even been found in research where the AAI has been conducted before the birth of the first child.Steele, H., Steele, M., & Fonagy, P. (1996). Associations among attachment classifications of mothers, fathers and their infants, Child Development, 67, 541-555. That patterns of adult discourse correlate with infant behavior in the Strange Situation is a surprising and rather remarkable finding. It is important to note that prediction of different patterns of infant attachment security from the AAI is not based upon the actual attachment history of the parent, but on the way in which the parent recounts that history.Hesse, E. (2008). The Adult Attachment Interview: Protocol, method of analysis, and empirical studies. In J. Cassidy & P.R. Shaver (Eds.), Handbook of attachment: Theory, research and clinical applications (2nd ed., pp.552-598). New York: McGraw-Hill. Main has explained that \\"while the content of an individual's life history cannot change, it can be told or reconstructed in many differing ways\\".Main, M. (2000). The organized categories of infant, child, and adult attachment: Flexible vs. inflexible attention under attachment-related stress, Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 48(4), 1055-1096, p.1083. An individual who describes extremely negative childhood attachment experiences could be classified as having a secure-autonomous state of mind if they describe these experiences in a coherent and apparently objective way. This is termed discontinuous ('earned') security. Main has also emphasised that attachment states of mind should not be viewed as fixed and unalterable: \\"these‚Ä¶ categorical placements‚Ä¶ must be understood to reference only current, and potentially changeable, states of mind with respect to attachment.\\"Main, M. (2000). The organized categories of infant, child, and adult attachment: Flexible vs. inflexible attention under attachment-related stress, Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 48(4), 1055-1096, p.1094. In later work, Main, DeMoss and HesseMain, M., DeMoss, A., & Hesse, E. (1991). Unresolved/disorganized/disoriented state of mind with respect to experiences of loss. In M. Main, R. Goldwyn & E. Hesse (Eds.), Adult attachment scoring and classification system. Version 7.2. Unpublished manuscript, University of California at Berkeley. reviewed the AAI transcripts of parents of children classified disorganized in their attachment behavior, and found that these parents exhibited characteristic 'slips' or 'lapses' in their discourse when discussing potentially traumatic experiences of loss or abuse. Some speakers exhibited lapses in reasoning, for example, making incompatible statements (e.g. describing a person as both dead and alive) or describing themselves as causal in a death or abuse in a way that is clearly not possible (e.g. describing themselves as killing a person with a thought). Other speakers exhibited lapses in discourse, suddenly moving into speech that was excessively detailed, eulogistic in style or that involved prolonged and unacknowledged silences.Hesse, E., & Main, M. (2000). Disorganized infant, child, and adult attachment: Collapse in Behavioral and attentional strategies, Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 48(4), 1097-1127. AAI transcripts involving definitive examples of such lapses are classified 'unresolved/disorganized'. In common with the approach to classifying infant disorganized attachment, adults classified as unresolved are also assigned a best-fitting alternative classification. Unresolved/disorganized adult responses have been found associated with disorganized infant behavior towards the speaker.Abrams, K.Y., Rifkin, A., & Hesse, E. (2006). Examining the role of parental frightened/frightening subtypes in predicting disorganized attachment within a brief observational procedure, Development and Psychopathology, 18, 345-361. A 'Cannot Classify' category has also been delineated by Hesse and Main which is used to describe interviews in which no single predominant attachment state of mind can be identified. Examples of cannot classify cases would include a transcript where the speaker's state of mind appears to shift mid-interview from dismissing to preoccupied, and a transcript where the speaker presents different states of mind when describing different attachment figures. Cannot classify interviews are rare in samples drawn from low-risk contexts.Hesse, E. (1996) Discourse, memory, and the Adult Attachment Interview: A note with emphasis on the emerging Cannot Classify category, Infant Mental Health Journal, 17(1), 4-11; Hesse, E., & Main, M. (2002). \\"Cannot Classify\\". In M. Main, R. Goldwyn & E. Hesse (Eds.), Adult attachment scoring and classification system. Version 7.2. Unpublished manuscript, University of California at Berkeley. Main and colleagues have developed a scoring and classification system for assessing AAI transcripts.Main, M., Goldwyn, R., & Hesse, E. (2003). Adult attachment scoring and classification system. Version 7.2. Unpublished manuscript, University of California at Berkeley. Transcripts are not only allocated to one of the five major classifications described above, but also assigned scores on a number of different scales and assigned to one or more of 12 sub- classifications.Hesse, E. (2008). The Adult Attachment Interview: Protocol, method of analysis, and empirical studies. In J. Cassidy & P.R. Shaver (Eds.), Handbook of attachment: Theory, research and clinical applications (2nd ed., pp.552-598). New York: McGraw-Hill. The AAI has been applied in both research and clinically. Research has found different AAI response patterns to be associated with different types of parental behavior. For example, secure- autonomous parents have been found to be more responsive to their infants than parents with a dismissing or preoccupied attachment state of mind.van IJzendoorn, M. (1995). Adult attachment representations, parental responsiveness, and infant attachment: A meta-analysis on the predictive validity or the Adult Attachment Interview, Psychological Bulletin, 117(3), 387-403. Unresolved responses to the AAI have been found associated with frightening, frightened or dissociative parental behaviourHesse, E. (2008). The Adult Attachment Interview: Protocol, method of analysis, and empirical studies. In J. Cassidy & P.R. Shaver (Eds.), Handbook of attachment: Theory, research and clinical applications (2nd ed., pp.552-598). New York: McGraw- Hill. but it has also been found that only a small part of the association between unresolved states of mind and disorganized infant attachment can be explained by the mediation of anomalous parental behavior, indicating that other as yet unknown factors must also be involved.Madigan, S., Bakermans- Kranenburg, M.J., van IJzendoorn, M.H., Moran, G., Pederson, D.R., & Benoit, D. (2006). Unresolved states of mind, anomalous parental behavior, and disorganized attachment: A review and meta-analysis of a transmission gap, Attachment & Human Development, 8(2),89-111. Some longitudinal studies have also found associations between attachment security in infancy, as assessed in the Strange Situation, and in young adulthood, as assessed by the AAI. In other studies however, no longitudinal association has been found.Hesse, E. (2008). The Adult Attachment Interview: Protocol, method of analysis, and empirical studies. In J. Cassidy & P.R. Shaver (Eds.), Handbook of attachment: Theory, research and clinical applications (2nd ed., pp.552-598). New York: McGraw-Hill. The evidence on the longitudinal stability of attachment security is therefore currently inconclusive. Main, like Bowlby before her, has stressed that attachment \\"security is in no way fixed or fully determined in infancy.\\"Main, M. (2000). The organized categories of infant, child, and adult attachment: Flexible vs. inflexible attention under attachment-related stress, Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 48(4), 1055-1096, p.1093. She has highlighted that a variety of favourable and unfavourable experiences may alter a child's developmental pathway and hence their state of mind with respect to attachment. A range of clinical applications of the AAI have also been proposed and developed. For example, the AAI has been applied to diagnosis, treatment, and the evaluation of therapeutic outcomes.Steele, H., & Steele, M. (2008), Clinical applications of the Adult Attachment Interview.

It takes place in November/December during the full moon day of ThinlƒÅ (‡§•‡§ø‡§Ç‡§≤‡§æ), the second month in the lunar Nepal Era calendar. Festival Yomari Punhi, meaning the full moon of yomari, is one of the most popular Newar festivals and is observed every year during the full moon of December. A yomari is a confection of rice flour (from the new harvest) dough shaped like fish and filled with brown cane sugar and sesame seeds, which is then steamed. This delicacy is the chief item on the menu during the post-harvest celebration of Yomari Punhi. On this full moon day, people of the Kathmandu Valley offer worship to Annapurna, the goddess of grains, for the rice harvest. Groups of kids go around neighborhood to beg yomari cakes from housewives in the evening. Sacred masked dances are performed in the villages of Hari Siddhi and Thecho at the southern end of the Valley to mark the festival.Nepal Travel GuideWe All Nepali In a yomari people keep chaku a chocolate-like food or khuwa a ricotta-cheese-like dairy product.It is very tasty. This is also one of the main festival celebrated only in newar community. Matinaa Paaru On the day after Yomari Punhi, a day alike Valentines Day is observed. According to Basu Pasa's historical book ‚ÄòKantipur‚Äô, among different shapes yomari, 'Bayo' symbolizes the male sexual organ whereas the triangle shaped with two points at the end known as 'Mayo' yomari suggests the female sexual organ and represents father and mother respectively. The Bayo yomari is filled with molasses and sesame seeds while the Mayo yomari is filled with pulses. So, Yomari is considered to be symbolic combination of sex. The culture of ‚ÄòYomari Fonegu‚Äô relates with love and romance. People went homes to home, toles to toles to ask Yomari, and at that time they got a chance to sneak peek and talk with their loved ones. In traditional days, society was restrictive with love. Yomari Punhi's ‚ÄòYomari Fonegu‚Äô culture was utilized as a cruising day in those times, and lovers would secretly meet the other day. There were no mobiles, no phones.

The lands ruled by a bishop as a prince (as opposed to his diocese). In the case of an archbishop: Erzstift. In the case of a prelate: Stift. Joachim Whaley, Germany and the Holy Roman Empire, Oxford University Press, 2012, volume 2, Glossary of German terms and other terms. The terms prince-bishopric (German: F√ºrstbistum, or simply Bistum) and ecclesiastical principality are synonymous with Hochstift. Erzstift and Kurerzstift referred respectively to the territory ruled by a prince-archbishop and an elector-archbishop while Stift referred to the territory ruled by an imperial abbot or abbess, or a princely abbot or abbess. Stift was also often used to refer to any type of ecclesiastical principality. The Hochstift was made of land mostly acquired in the Middle Age through donations by the king/emperor, bequests by local lords or through purchase. It was often made of non-contiguous parts, some of which could be located outside the bishop‚Äôs diocese. The prince-bishop, elected by the canons of the cathedral chapter and often belonging to the high nobility, enjoyed imperial immediacy; he wielded the same authority over his principality as any secular prince, such as a duke or a margrave, over his. He had seat and vote at the Imperial Diet. From a high of approximately 40 in the late Middle Ages, the number of Hochstifte was down to 26Including the Archbishoprics-Electorates of Mainz, Trier and Cologne and the Archbishopric of Salzburg by the late 18th century. They had all been secularized and their territory absorbed by secular states by the time the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806. Etymology and related and derived terms Hochstifte and dioceses in the late 18th century Das Stift [plural: die Stifte or, in some regions, die Stifter]/het sticht [in Dutch] (literally, the \\"donation\\"), denotes in its original meaning the donated or else acquired fund of estates whose revenues are taken to maintain a college and the pertaining church (Stiftskirche, i.e. collegiate church) and its collegiate canons (Stiftsherr[en]) or canonesses (Stiftsfrau[en]).Victor Dollmayr, Friedrich Kr√ºer, Heinrich Meyer and Walter Paetzel, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch (started by the Brothers Grimm): 33 vols.

If the Stift as a fund served to maintain the specific college of a cathedral (a so- called cathedral chapter) then the Stift was often called das Domstift (i.e. cathedral donation [fund]). Hochstift is a compound with hoch (\\"high\\") used for a prince-bishopric, meaning literally a \\"high [ranking ecclesiastical] donation [fund of estates]\\".Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch: 33 vols.

Whereas Erzstift, a compound with Erz‚Ä¶ (\\"arch[i]‚Ä¶\\"), was the corresponding expression for a prince-archbishopric.Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch: 33 vols.

For the three prince-electorates of Cologne (Kurk√∂ln), Mainz (Kurmainz) and Trier (Kurtrier), which were simultaneously archbishoprics the corresponding term is Kurerzstift (electorate- archbishopric). The adjective pertaining to Stift as a territory is stiftisch (of, pertaining to a prince-bishopric; prince-episcopal).Victor Dollmayr, Friedrich Kr√ºer, Heinrich Meyer and Walter Paetzel, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch (started by the Brothers Grimm): 33 vols.

Specific prince- bishoprics were often called Hochstift/Erzstift X, as in Hochstift Ermland or in Erzstift Bremen, with stiftbremisch meaning of/pertaining to the Prince- Archbishopric of Bremen, as opposed to stadtbremisch (of/pertaining to the city of Bremen). By contrast, the spiritual entities, the dioceses, are called Bistum (\\"diocese\\") or Erzbistum (\\"archdiocese\\") in German. The difference between a Hochstift/Erzstift and a Bistum/Erzbistum is not always clear to authors so that non-scholarly texts often translate Hochstift or Erzstift incorrectly simply as diocese/bishopric or archdiocese/archbishopric, respectively.

Development The FP-303 was designed by Fisher Aircraft in the United States in 1982 and was intended to meet the requirements of the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, including that category's maximum empty weight. The design goal was to provide ultralight pilots with an aircraft that was as portable as possible. To this end the aircraft's wings fold along the fuselage to rest on the horizontal stabilizer allowing trailering or storage in a small hangar or with other aircraft. The aircraft can be field assembled from its travelling state in ten minutes. The FP-303 has a standard empty weight of when equipped with a two-stroke Rotax 277 engine. The construction of the FP-303 is similar to the Fisher FP-202 Koala. The aircraft's structure is entirely made from wood, with the wooden fuselage built from wood strips arranged in a geodesic form, resulting in a very strong and light aircraft with redundant load paths. Both the wings and fuselage are covered with doped aircraft fabric. The wings are strut-braced underneath to the landing gear and utilize bottom jury struts. The wing is positioned aft enough that the pilot has adequate downward visibility. Flaps and brakes are optional. The company claims it takes an amateur builder between 300‚Äì500 hours to build the FP-303.

A reuptake enhancer (RE), also sometimes referred to as a reuptake activator, is a type of reuptake modulator which enhances the plasmalemmal transporter-mediated reuptake of a neurotransmitter from the synapse into the pre-synaptic neuron, leading to a decrease in the extracellular concentrations of the neurotransmitter and therefore a decrease in neurotransmission. The antidepressant tianeptine was once claimed to be a (selective) serotonin reuptake enhancer (SRE or SSRE), but the role of serotonin reuptake in its mechanism is doubtful. Tianeptine has no affinity for the serotonin transporter, neither increases nor decreases extracellular levels of serotonin in cortico-limbic structures of conscious rats, and it didn't show any other long-term effect on the serotonin pathway. Thus, tianeptine's role as an SSRE may have been the coincidence of a yet unknown mechanism of action. Coluracetam is a choline-reuptake enhancer.

But his innovative use of knitwear, which he continuously developed throughout his career, was often his signature and was an influence on other designers.  Early years  Sant'Angelo was born as Jorge Alberto Imperatrice in Rosario, Argentina, from a middle class hard working family. Son of Domingo Antonio Imperatrice and Leila Ratti, he had a younger brother, Hector Daniel Imperatrice (born 10/4/1945). Later in life, he said he was born anobleman in Florence, Italy, the son of a Florentine count. He received a degree in architecture at the University of Florence, then studied industrial design and ceramics. He also studied with Picasso for six months, as the result of winning an international ceramics competition, sponsored by the French government. Picasso encouraged his student to \\"trust his own restless creativity and to keep on trying new artistic ventures,\\" and Sant'Angelo created an animated film cartoon and submitted it to Walt Disney. Impressed by the film's inventiveness, Disney brought him to Hollywood and gave him an apprenticeship. But unable to speak English well, Sant'Angelo was lost in the vastness of Los Angeles and quit after 15 days.\\"Fantasy Fashions\\", Life, U.S. 7 March 1969. Retrieved 27 April 2011.  New York  Sant'Angelo moved to New York City after his experience at Disney. He first worked as textile artist, and later worked in interior design. For fun, he started making Lucite and plastic jewelry. Catherine Murray di Montezemolo first noticed the jewelry, then later Diana Vreeland, who started featuring it in Vogue magazine. This set his career into motion. Ms. Vreeland recognized the talent that Sant'Angelo showed, and hired him as a freelance stylist. It was out of this collaboration that some of the most iconic fashion photographs of the 1960s were taken. Shots like the model Verushka wrapped in fur in the desert, or psychedelic flower makeup around one of Twiggy's eyes.  Seventh Avenue  Sant'Angelo with friend, guitarist Michael Laucke who often provided the music for Sant'Angelo's New York fashion shows Sant'Angelo opened his own ready-to- wear business in 1966. He experimented with knits, and developed new fabrications with textile mills like DuPont. He also collaborated with textile converters like Crantex, to create his own prints, and leather makers like Calderon, for his accessories. He cited various native and ethnic cultures as the inspiration for his collections, like the American Indian or the Bohemian Gypsy. But his most important contribution to modern women's clothing at the time was his liberating construction techniques and his use of stretch fabrics. He rejected the traditional shift with the zipper-up-the-back, and instead, designed clothing that wrapped, tied, hung or clung to the body. He didn't simply design clothes, he ornamented the body and made fantasy wearable. He made couture pieces for celebrities and entertainers as well. Eventually, he started to license his name and expand into cheaper, more affordable clothing. The first line was called Sant'Angelo 4U2, which were less expensive versions of his fantasy pieces. Then there was the 'Marjer Parts' line, which was also more affordable, but more trend-influenced. Later, he dropped the 'di' from his last name and licensed out his name as Giorgio Sant'Angelo. Unfortunately, much of that clothing did not have his own hand involved, and instead, was overly commercial and did not possess his innovative signature. In 1976, Sant'Angelo befriended guitarist Michael Laucke, whom he met through jewelry designer, philanthropist and former fashion model Elsa Peretti, and Sant'Angelo frequently hired Laucke to play at the launching of his new lines in New York, setting \\"the pace for a more subdued Sant'Angelo\\".  Comeback  In the mid-1980s, Sant'Angelo added the \\"di\\" back to his last name and continued to design his high end signature line. Made almost entirely out of stretch knits, critics hailed it, confirming the return of his influence. The versatile, wrap stretch pieces of clothing, in unique materials, colors and patterns, proved an antidote to the overly tailored styles of the time. Unfortunately, di Sant'Angelo died in 1989, so his comeback was short-lived. But his legend continues in the minds of modern- day fashionistas, with designers like John Galliano and Marc Jacobs citing him as an influence. He was given a plaque on the 7th Avenue walk of fame along with his contemporaries such as Halston and Stephen Burrows.

Inspired by real-life instances, the episode features a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation into a stolen painting which may have a tainted provenance. Gena Rowlands, who works as an advocate for Holocaust survivors, portrayed a Holocaust survivor who claimed that the painting was originally her family's painting. Within the series, the episode also depicts the Eppes family as Jewish. \\"Provenance\\" first aired in the United States on October 6, 2006. Critics gave the episode positive reviews. They felt moved by the episode's plot and by Rowland's performance. Plot summary Someone shoots an art museum security guard and steals a Camille Pissarro painting worth $20 million. FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) and David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) learn that the painting was to go on tour within the month. FBI Special Agent Jack Tollner (Garret Dillahunt) from the FBI's Art Theft division informs the team that the painting was possibly plundered by the Nazis during World War II, creating a tainted provenance. The investigation into the painting reveals that Erika Hellman (Gena Rowlands), a 78-year-old Holocaust survivor, made a claim in court years before that the painting belonged to her. The team learns that the court ruled that the painting belonged to current owner Peyton Shoemaker (Zach Grenier), whose father bought it in an art store in Germany after World War II. Shoemaker had loaned it to the museum to reduce insurance costs. Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) says that he could help find the painting. Interviews with Mrs. Hellman and her grandson, Joel Hellman (Matt Ross), reveal that both Hellmans want the painting back and that Joel had contacted an art thief but never followed through with stealing the painting. Meanwhile, back at Charlie's house, Charlie and Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), Charlie and Don's father, argue about the distribution of chores. Alan wants Charlie to do more around the house, and Charlie later claims that he is too busy with FBI work. Charlie and his friends and colleagues Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol), and Dr. Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat) trace the countries in which the painting could be, but their analysis shows that it must still be in the United States. During this time, Larry reveals that his father was an artist who wanted Larry to follow in his footsteps and that Larry attempted to apply to art school before going into physics. Meanwhile, Megan interviews the museum's curator, Arthur Ruiz (Benito Martinez), and the art preservationist about the painting and asks for a museum catalog which shows the painting. Charlie uses the photo from the catalog to determine that the painting is a forgery. The team quickly eliminates three potential forgery suspects: one is in jail, and two are dead as one was murdered during the current investigation. The team learns that the real painting, forged in the 1940s by a forger who died in 1946, has been in a Hungarian vault for 60 years. Megan and David go to the museum and arrest Ruiz for insurance fraud. He and the art preservationist knew that the painting was a forgery and reported it stolen for insurance purposes. Don returns the real painting to the Hellmans and explains that Mrs. Hellman's father, possibly foreseeing its theft by the Nazis, commissioned the forgery. At the house, Alan and Charlie show that they have a better understanding of each other's concerns about Charlie's ability to balance home life and work, which was the cause of their earlier argument. Don, whose curiosity about his family's lack of adherence to religious practices has been aroused by Mrs. Hellman's story, asks Alan if he minded Don attempting to learn whether the family of the cousin of Don's paternal grandmother, who left Germany before World War II, survived the Holocaust. Alan volunteers to assist. Production Origin of the episode The case is inspired by the real-life instances in which Holocaust survivors attempt to prove that various pieces of artwork have been taken by the Nazis during World War II. Writing Series creators Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, when writing the show, wanted the Eppes family to be Jewish. Meanwhile, series regular Rob Morrow wanted to explore the impact of Judaism on the Eppes family and/or Don. Heuton and Falacci felt that the story for \\"Provenance\\" would be the ideal story to demonstrate that aspect of the family. According to creator Cheryl Heuton, \\"Provenance\\" also marked the beginning of the exploration of some of Don's personal issues. Casting notes Gena Rowlands played the Holocaust survivor. Rowlands, an advocate for Holocaust survivors, was moved by both the plot of the episode and by the family dynamic. Reception Over 11.07 million people watched \\"Provenance\\". Critically, the show was very well received. Cynthia Boris of DVD Verdict said that \\"there's a human side to the episode that brought me to tears\\". An Amazon.com editor, Donald Liebenson called \\"Provenance\\" \\"compelling\\" and stated that Rowlands' performance was \\"heartbreaking\\".

This is the politics, historical and present-day, surrounding the participation in the Olympics of the Chinese Olympic Team, the Chinese Taipei Olympic Team and to a much lesser extent the Hong Kong Olympic Team. This article is not concerned with Sport. History Though China entered international sports affairs and initiated a relationship with the IOC as early as May 1915, it did not actually participate in the Olympic Games until 1932. After a long civil war between communists and nationalists (KMT), which intensified after the end of World War II, the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established on 1 October 1949. The defeated KMT \\"Republic of China\\" (ROC) government evacuated to the island of Formosa, now known as Taiwan. Thus, from this time in history, the ROC and the PRC have each fielded rival teams and this has led to a series of historical incidents in international and IOC affairs. 1958 Olympics The PRC withdrew from the IOC and from all international sports federations in 1958. The PRC decision taken in 1958 prompted its absence from the Olympic Movement for a period of 25 years. PRC re-emerges on Sporting stage The PRC began its return to the IOC in 1971 by resuming participation in the Asian Games. Some members of the IOC supported integrating the PRC into the Olympic movement. In September at the 71st IOC Session in Luxembourg, PRC participation was raised as an issue. However, the response received was that the IOC was ready to welcome all NOCs whose statutes conformed to IOC rules (including, for the PRC, accepting that the Republic of China also had an Olympic team). This was unacceptable to the PRC. Early in 1973, the Japanese Olympic Committee began writing to various international federations and National Olympic Committees calling for the PRC's reinstatement in the IOC. The Japanese Olympic Committee sought the expulsion of the ROC. In October 1973, the Asian Games Federation voted to admit the PRC to the Teheran Asian Games and to expel the ROC. At the IOC Congress in Varna in October 1973, one of the main topics of discussion dealt with the inclusion of the PRC in the Olympic Games and its return to the international sporting world. The IOC's reaction to the decision taken by the Asian Games Federation: In order to have IOC-patronage the Asian Games Organizing Committees had to invite all NOCs in their area. It was also an IOC-rule stating that a nation without an NOC could not be invited. Evidently the PRC was going to be invited, but not the Republic of China (Taiwan). (21) The question of the PRC's IOC membership, however, did not gain prominence until April 9, 1975. At the IOC Session in Lausanne, the PRC made a formal application for recognition as \\"the sole sports organization representing the whole of China.\\" At the same time, the PRC set a condition that Taiwan should be excluded. At the IOC Executive Committee meeting in Rome in May 1975, a formal request for the admission of the PRC NOC was presented to the IOC by the Iranian NOC. The IOC member from Taiwan, Henry Hsu, in regard to the PRC application, was in favour of admitting China provided that it met the provisions of the Olympic Rules. On the question of the PRC demand that Taiwan be expelled, Hsu reminded his fellow IOC members of several points: (1) that never before had an applicant set prior conditions for acceptance by the IOC; (2) that the PRC did not control sport in Taiwan; (3) that the IOC had granted recognition to other divided states (Germany and Korea), and (4) that only when an NOC had broken the rules could it be expelled. In early May 1975, the PRC issued a statement: ... any attempt to resolve the conflict by changing the name of the ROC (Taiwan) committee, or keeping Taiwan in the IOC as separate state, or by inviting the PRC and yet not expelling Taiwan, would be unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of the Chinese people. (31) Finally the decision was made as follows: \\"An IOC-delegation headed by the President should visit China. In the absence of sufficient information there would be no vote taken during the Session.\\" (32) On 1 November 1975, the Iranian NOC intensified its campaign. They pointed out, \\"No vote was ever held on the acceptance of an NOC in Taiwan during the early years after the founding of the PRC.\\" (34) Montreal 1976 The 1976 Olympics were awarded to Montreal in May 1970. On 23 May 1975, in response to a question as to whether or not the government would support the participation of both Chinas at the 1976 Summer Games, Canadian officials stated that \\"these decisions have to be made by the International Olympic Committee. We are the host for the games but we do not decide who participates.\\" (37) Beijing had formally requested that the Canadian Government bar unconditionally the entry of the Taiwanese delegation. Canada refused to do this, (38) on the condition that Taiwan compete in the Olympics without reference to the word \\"China,\\" a condition that applied to Taiwan's participation in the 1960 Games in Rome. (39) At that time (1960), Taiwan participated as the representative of Taiwan and not as the representative of the Republic of China. (40) That situation included not using \\"the flag, anthem, or any symbol of the 'Republic of China' or use team designation that includes the word China,\\" (41) because: \\"we (Canada) recognize the PRC and we are not under this guise proposing to import into our foreign policy a two-China policy.\\" The Canadian Government did not reveal its position until the end of May 1976. In a reply to the Canadian stance, the IOC issued a statement in Lausanne: The Canadian position is in direct conflict with fundamental Olympic principles and that Montreal would never have been awarded the Games ... if Canada had not given assurances that athletes from all National Olympic Committees recognized by the IOC would be allowed to attend. (43) As part of its bid to host the 1976 Olympics, Canada has pledged to admit any teams that represent the National Olympic Committees and National Sports Federations that the IOC recognizes. However, there was a clause added to this agreement reserving \\"the normal regulations,\\" which turned out to be the Canadian position that no country could represent another nation that Canada had relations. In the end, China was not admitted in time so Taiwan participated using the name 'Republic of China.' A string of negotiations finally resolved the participation of China and Taiwan in 1981. It was agreed that PRC's NOC would be recognized as the Chinese Olympic Committee while the Taiwan NOC was to be known as the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee. Later, in a 1989 accord, China and Taiwan agreed to name the Taiwanese Olympic delegation as \\"zhonghua taibei\\" (Chinese Taipei) instead of \\"zhongguo taiwan\\" or \\"zhongguo taibei.\\" The Taiwanese acceded because the term zhongguo taibei makes Taiwan part of China while zhonghua taibei does not. On the other hand, China was content with the term because it acknowledged Chinese ethnic background and did not use taiwan, which is a national identifier. Hong Kong Hong Kong has had a distinct National Olympic Committee since 1950 and has competed at the Games since 1952. After the territory was returned to the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was created in 1997, this arrangement has continued, with Hong Kong competing independently from the rest of the nation.

Mont Gargan has an altitude of 731 metres; at the summit are the ruins of a chapel built between 1868 and 1871 by Louis Joyeux with the support of the population, and dedicated to Notre-Dame du Bon Secours. The chapel became damaged but was restored in 1992 by the Haute- Vienne general council and by the Friends of Mont Gargan. Since 1986, the chapel has been the property of the Haute-Vienne department. The summit was at one time covered with heather and gorse, which have since given way to a prairie. A stele recalls the Second World War battle of Mont Gargan fought between the German army and the maquis resistance fighters led by Georges Guingouin. Contrary to what is widely stated in books and maps, Mount Gargan is not the highest point in Haute-Vienne; the forest of Crozat and the puy de Lauzat, 25 kilometres to the north-east near Nedde, are higher, at 777 metres above sea level.

She won the 2015 Melbourne Cup, riding Prince of Penzance, and is the first and only female jockey to win the event. Early life The youngest child of ten of Paddy and Mary Payne, Payne grew up on a farm at Miners Rest, a locality near Ballarat in central Victoria, Australia. Her mother Mary died in a motor vehicle crash when Payne was six months old, leaving her father Paddy to raise their ten children as a single father. Payne dreamt of being a winning jockey as a child, and, aged seven, told friends she would one day win the Melbourne Cup. She attended Our Lady Help of Christians primary school and Loreto College, Ballarat, and entered racing aged 15, the eighth of the Payne children to do so. She has Irish New Zealand heritage. Career She won in her first race at Ballarat, aboard Reigning‚Äîa horse trained by her father. In March 2004, Payne fell heavily at a race in Sandown Racecourse in Melbourne, fracturing her skull and bruising her brain. As a result of her prolonged recovery period‚Äîincluding a further fall where she fractured her wrist‚ÄîPayne was granted a three-month extension to her apprenticeship to allow her time to ride out her claim. Payne won her first Group One race, the Toorak Handicap at Caulfield Racecourse aboard Allez Wonder on 10 October 2009, and trainer Bart Cummings offered her the ride at the Caulfield Cup the following week. Payne was the third female jockey to ride in the Caulfield Cup. As a first-timer in the 2009 Melbourne Cup, she rode Cummings' Allez Wonder with a riding weight of 50.5 kg. The horse was placed 16th in the field of 23. In 2010 Payne rode Yosei to victory in the Thousand Guineas at Caulfield. Melbourne Cup 2015 In 2015, she gained national attention when she rode the winning horse in two races at Melbourne Cup carnival at the Flemington Racecourse. One of them was the Hilton Hotels Stakes and the other was the Melbourne Cup itself. Payne said she was \\"floating on the cloud and it's a nice feeling\\". Payne won the Melbourne Cup on 3 November 2015, riding Prince of Penzance, a six-year- old gelding with which she had a long-term association. The training strategy used in the lead-up to the race included a focus on galloping, and a consistent horse-jockey relationship. \\"...'you know what?' Payne asked. \\"It's not all about strength, there is so much more involved, getting the horse to try for you, it's being patient.\\" Payne was the first woman to win the Melbourne Cup in its 155-year history. She was also the fourth woman to ride in the race and was coincidentally wearing the colours of the suffragette movement: purple, green and white. In an interview shortly after her Melbourne Cup win, Payne said that horse racing is a \\"chauvinistic sport\\". Her short speech about the capability of women in sport was described as \\"unambiguous and galvanising\\". She later stated that she hopes her win \\"helps female jockeys\\". The victory was a surprise for bookmakers and speechmakers. The horse, bought for $50,000 (a figure described by sportswriters as \\"pocket change\\" for horseflesh) was a long odds chance at 100‚Äì1, and afterwards Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove and other speechmakers were criticised for failing to adapt their pre-prepared congratulations to acknowledge the historic nature of the win. 2016-2017 seasons In May 2016, Payne suffered severe abdominal injuries in a race fall at Mildura. She underwent urgent surgery for a torn pancreas, with surgeons saving the organ, otherwise she would have become a diabetic. She returned to racing in September 2016, though noted that her future goals included a move from being a jockey to becoming a trainer. In October 2016, she was awarded the Don Award at the Sport Australia Hall of Fame awards. The Don Award is \\"awarded to a sportsperson who, through their achievements and example over the last 12 months, is considered to have most inspired the nation\\". In May 2017, Payne received international recognition when awarded the Longines Ladies Award in Washington U.S. The award paid tribute to \\"distinguished women whose careers have shown a positive influence and exceptional commitment to the equine cause\\" On 23 June 2017, Payne was stood down from racing after she had tested positive for the drug phentermine, an appetite suppressant banned under Australian Rule of Racing 81B. The traces were found in Payne's urine from a test taken on 11 June 2017, at the Swan Hill Cup meeting. Payne faced an inquiry by Racing Victoria stewards on 29 June 2017. Payne pleaded guilty to taking the appetite suppressant phentermine and was banned for four weeks until 21 July 2017. Payne said after the investigation \\"The onus is 100 per cent with me ‚Ä¶ I regret not seeking more guidance, I wasn‚Äôt thorough, and that is completely my fault. My sincere apologies to everyone.\\" She also speaks at conferences around Australia and internationally sharing her inspiring story. Legacy In 2019, Michelle Payne's victory was made into a feature film, Ride Like a Girl, with Teresa Palmer in the role of Payne.

He previously wrote and produced audio readings of the Pooh stories, with Judi Dench as Kanga and Geoffrey Palmer as Eeyore. He sent the trustees of the A. A. Milne estate two sample stories of his sequel, and it took more than eight years for them to approve the project. At the time of the book's publication he admitted to nerves over its reception, saying, > What's the worst thing that can happen, that I'll be torn apart by wild > journalists? Happened before and I survived. At worst everyone will hate me > and I'll just crawl under a bush and hide ‚Äì I can live with that. Some > people do hate the whole idea of a sequel, but it's not as if I'm doing any > damage to the original, that will still be there. My hope is that people > will finish reading a cracking story and just want more of them, and that's > where I come in. Michael Brown, chairman of the Pooh Properties Trust, said Benedictus had a \\"wonderful feel\\" for the world of Pooh. However, Publishers Weekly was cool on the book, describing it as \\"largely forgettable\\" and as missing \\"the charm of the first book\\". Benedictus commented on his work in 1985, \\"Given peace of mind, financial independence, and a modicum of luck, I may produce a novel to be proud of one day.\\"Kirkpatrick, D. L.; Vinson, James.

He published an autobiography, Dropping Names, in 2005. According to an interview Benedictus gave to the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot in 2009, he said that a cousin had done research into his surname and found out that it was actually \\"Baruch\\" (◊ë◊®◊ï◊ö - having the same meaning as \\"Benedictus\\" in Hebrew), as well as research into how his ancestors emigrated to Britain, which revealed that they have Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.

Mamet has stated that the intended \\"theme is race and the lies we tell each other on the subject.\\" Plot A racially charged sex crime takes place which leads to charges being made against Charles Strickland, a wealthy resident in his town. He quickly goes to his friend Jack Lawson, a criminal attorney, and retains him to defend his case. Lawson agrees and begins to rely on help from a young black attorney he calls Susan working in his three-lawyer office. As evidence and police reports begin to accumulate for the preparation of the defense of the case, Jack begins to suspect deep flaws in the police investigation of the crime scene. He notes that although the crime reports clearly identify the crime victim as having worn a red sequin dress on the night of the sex crime that something is wrong with the details in the police reports. From his personal experience, he explains to his fellow law office partners (Susan and Brown) how fragile sequin dresses are in general, and how even the slightest incident of jarring or simple out-on-the-town wearing of a sequin dress inevitably leads to sequins popping and falling off almost without any provocation whatsoever. However, the police reports, although otherwise seeming to be thorough, are completely absent of any information about any red sequins being missing or laying around the victim's room in question where an apparent extensive struggle had taken place. The other law partners are impressed by the startling omission, and all three partners come to the conclusion, with increasing and visible confidence before each other, that this omission by the police is very deeply flawed. They are convinced that the credibility of the police reports cannot withstand questioning in the courtroom. All three lawyers feel that their client will be exonerated. The next day, however, news come to the lawyers that a maid in the hotel has \\"remembered\\" that she saw sequins under the bed. In the process of further interviews with his client, discussions with his partner, and with Susan, Jack becomes aware of even further complications in the case. The ethnic prejudices of his old friend whom he is defending turn out to be highly suspect and pejorative. More importantly, he begins to suspect that Susan's hand in the activities taking place in the law office after receiving the case may be tainted. Susan turns out to have strong feeling about racially motivated sex crimes and she is far from unbiased in the representation of the case. As Jack continues to quiz her and challenge her on her own beliefs it becomes clear that Susan had come to play a part in the statement of the maid materialising overnight and invalidating the fragile sequin theory the partners were planning to use. It becomes clear by the final curtain that Susan had leaked the information concerning the basis of Jack's planned defense, the fragile sequin theory, to the police and/or DA. It becomes clear that Susan had done this in order to influence the outcome in a matter of justice involving a question of bigotry and of race.

Critical reception The play has received mixed reviews. Ben Brantley, in his review for The New York Times, wrote: \\"Though the first act of 'Race' is similarly propelled by barbed one-liners, its second act offers reassuring evidence of Mr. Mamet‚Äôs scalpel-edged intelligence. And the issues it raises, particularly on the ethnic varieties of shame and the universal nature of guilt, should offer ample nutrition for many a post-theater dinner conversation.... Yet despite the tension of its subject, and an abundance of the corkscrew plot twists for which Mr. Mamet is known, ‚ÄúRace‚Äù lacks real dramatic tension.\\" Brantley gives James Spader a rave in his Broadway debut, stating, \\"Mr. Spader could play Jack with his heavy- lidded eyes closed. He keeps them wide open, and considers every inflection and gesture in creating the one role in ‚ÄúRace‚Äù with more layers than the who‚Äôs-scamming-whom plot. He‚Äôs good enough to make you wish that Mr. Mamet had given his other actors the same opportunity.\\" In a 2017 article for The Times Literary Supplement, Jaki Mccarrick said of November, Race, and The Anarchist that \\"these are state-of-the-nation plays. Each of them is outstanding, and bears Mamet‚Äôs trademarks ‚Äì rhythmic and witty dialogue, erudition, flawless musicality ‚Äì while being similar in construction and in how their big ideas are explored. They are also sufficiently different to be treated as stand- alone pieces, (though I would be glad to see them performed together).\\" References External links * Category:2009 plays Category:Plays by David Mamet Category:Broadway plays Category:Plays about race and ethnicity ","title":"Race (play)"},{"id":"24719264","title":"William Burke, 7th Earl of Clanricarde"},{"id":"24719273","text":"The ITM Jose Marti in Cuba, which may be translated as \\"Military Technical Institute\\", is a cadet school.

Its aim is to make filmmaking easier, more effective and possible for everyone. History Star Wreck Studios Oy Ltd and Wreckamovie were created by a group of filmmakers from Finland, who in 2005 created the freely downloadable Star Trek parody movie Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning. It gained web fame for being created and distributed by a community of enthusiasts over the internet, and for its special effects only made on a shoestring budget using standard home computers. The experiences of the group creating the aforementioned film, their first feature film, led them to develop a platform that's open and easy to use for everyone. Characteristics Wreckamovie is considered a model example of the potential of Web 2.0 according to Cisco Systems Finland Oy. As a business model it presents the exact opposite of the traditional way of making movies. With it a community creates and distributes the film, and only then, once popularity has already been gained, profitability steps in. Wreckamovie serves all kinds of audiovisual productions, from short films and music videos to feature-length films. The concept is that anyone can build a community for a movie or any audiovisual project, and ask for assistance in desired tasks for the production. The service makes it possible to produce films together with the community, and thus to create a real interaction with the audience from the development stage. The service doesn't distinguish between \\"professionals\\" and \\"amateurs\\", but emphasizes on enthusiasm. In addition to online distribution, the creators want to distribute movies in every possible way, ranging from traditional movie screens to cell phones. Then the existing community serves as a strong potential base for viral marketing. Current users On 16 October 2009 Wreckamovie was being used for the production of the reference movie for the service, a full-length scifi parody Iron Sky. It was earlier used for the now accomplished Finnish horror film Sauna. The platform is open for service in general. There were more than 300 active projects listed on Wreckamovie in 2009. Awards In 2008 the movie production community Wreck-A-Movie was elected the winner of the MindTrek Grand Prix 2008, ‚Ç¨20 008. In October 2009 Wreckamovie was chosen among the 36 finalists in SIME conference's Rising Star of the North -competition, finishing 23rd overall.

The technique relies on the ability of adenine (A) and thymine (T) (complementary basepairs) on different DNA fragments to hybridize and, in the presence of ligase, become ligated together. PCR products are usually amplified using Taq DNA polymerase which preferentially adds an adenine to the 3' end of the product. Such PCR amplified inserts are cloned into linearized vectors that have complementary 3' thymine overhangs. Procedure Diagram of TA Cloning. Creating the insert The insert is created by PCR using Taq polymerase. This polymerase lacks 3' to 5' proofreading activity and, with a high probability, adds a single, 3'-adenine overhang to each end of the PCR product. It is best if the PCR primers have guanines at the 5' end as this maximizes probability of Taq DNA polymerase adding the terminal adenosine overhang. Thermostable polymerases containing extensive 3¬¥ to 5¬¥ exonuclease activity should not be used as they do not leave the 3¬¥ adenine-overhangs. Creating the vector The target vector is linearized and cut with a blunt-end restriction enzyme. This vector is then tailed with dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) using terminal transferase. It is important to use ddTTP to ensure the addition of only one T residue. This tailing leaves the vector with a single 3'-overhanging thymine residue on each blunt end. Manufacturers commonly sell TA Cloning \\"kits\\" with a wide range of prepared vectors that have already been linearized and tagged with an overhanging thymine. Benefits and drawbacks Given that there is no need for restriction enzymes other than for generating the linearized vector, the procedure is much simpler and faster than traditional subcloning. There is also no need to add restriction sites when designing primers and thus shorter primers can be used saving time and money. In addition, in instances where there are no viable restriction sites that can be used for traditional cloning, TA cloning is often used as an alternative. The major downside of TA cloning is that directional cloning is not possible, so the gene has a 50% chance of getting cloned in the reverse direction.

Sikhs Sikhs have been a part of the American populace for more than 130 years. At the turn of the 19th century, the state of Punjab of British India was hit hard by British practices of mercantilism.

Most rhomaleosaurids are known from England, many specifically from lower Blue Lias deposits that date back to the earliest Jurassic, just at the boundary with the Triassic. In fact, to date only two undisputed rhomaleosaurids were named from outside Europe - the closely related Borealonectes russelli and Maresaurus coccai from Canada and Argentina, respectively. These two species are also the only Middle Jurassic representatives of the family. Rhomaleosauridae was formally named by Kuhn in 1961, originally proposed to include Rhomaleosaurus cramptoni and its relatives, which have short necks and large heads relatively to plesiosauroids like Elasmosaurus and Plesiosaurus, but longer necks and smaller heads relatively to advanced pliosaurids like Pliosaurus and Kronosaurus. Phylogeny Rhomaleosauridae is a stem-based taxon defined in 2010 (and in earlier studies in a similar manner) as \\"all taxa more closely related to Meyerasaurus victor than to Leptocleidus superstes, Pliosaurus brachydeirus or Polycotylus latipinnis\\". Modern cladistic analyses are divided in the position of Rhomaleosauridae; some recover it at the base of Plesiosauria in a position basal to Neoplesiosauria that contains both the pliosauroids and the plesiosauroids, while other analyses recover Rhomaleosauridae as pliosauroids, to the exclusion of Plesiosauroidea, either as the sister taxon of Pliosauridae or, rarely, as a paraphyletic array of taxa leading to it. Additionally, many putative rhomaleosaurids from the early deposits of Blue Lias, vary greatly in their position across various phylogenetic analyses. Some of these are recovered as basal rhomaleosaurids in certain analyses, or alternatively outside Rhomaleosauridae in more basal positions within Plesiosauria. The following two cladograms are simplified after two recent analyses, showing only the relationships within Rhomaleosauridae, and some other relevant basal taxa whose position within the family is highly uncertain.

Dr. Pinsky became suspicious that she was using illicit substances, or had been prior to being admitted, and the staff psychiatrist diagnosed her as having Borderline Personality Disorder, both of which require treatment before any treatment can be done for sexual addiction. She was eventually discharged involuntarily for failing to obey the rules. Pinsky offered her an alternative program at a psychiatric hospital nearby, but she angrily refused. Criticism Drew Pinsky, producer John Irwin and Irwin Entertainment, which produce the show, have been criticized by addiction specialists in regard to Celebrity Rehab, from which Sex Rehab was spun off, for allegedly poor treatment techniques. With respect to Sex Rehab in particular, alumnus Duncan Roy has criticized the show's producers for prioritizing titillation and drama over rehabilitation for the patients in terms of casting, filming tactics and their editing choices, claiming that they instigated the behavior that resulted in Kari Ann Peniche's expulsion from the program in order to create a more watchable program. Roy has also questioned Pinsky's competence, saying that Jill Vermeire and Dr. John Sealy were his true source of therapeutic insight, and that while Pinsky is adept at treating drug and alcohol addiction, he is not knowledgeable in sex addiction, and merely repeated Vermeire's ideas. Roy further alleged that Sealy, whom Roy perceived as genuinely interested in helping sex addicts, confided in him that the producers had other motivations, and kept his involvement in the show minimal because he was not telegenic enough. Episodes After filming Duncan Roy moved from his Malibu, California estate to a small Hollywood apartment, where he is co-star Jennifer Ketcham's neighbor. Kari Ann Peniche appeared on the third season of Celebrity Rehab, during which it was confirmed that when entering the unit in Sex Rehab, she had smuggled speed in a teddy bear.

Vila Real was ranked seventh in the list of Portugal's most livable cities in the survey of living conditions published by the Portuguese newspaper Expresso in 2007.Classifica√ß√£o Expresso das melhores cidades portuguesas para viver em 2007, Expresso History The region shows traces of inhabitation during the paleolithic era, while the settlement of Pan√≥ias had a Roman presence. Vila Real itself was founded in 1289 by King Denis of Portugal, hence its name, meaning Royal Town. It housed more members of the royal family during the Middle Ages than any other settlement in Portugal except the capital in Lisbon, and family Coats of Arms remain above old houses, some of which still occupied by those families. Vineyards were introduced to the municipality in 1764, growing red, white and ros√© wines for export. Despite its royal presence, Vila Real only gained city status under the Portuguese Republic in 1925. Coat of arms Igreja da Gra√ßa in Santar√©m. The coat of arms of Vila Real - a sword embedded in a wreath of zambujeiro (wild olive tree) and the slogan Aleu - is derived from the decorative motif of the tomb of Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real, found in the Igreja da Gra√ßa in Santar√©m. 'Aleu' or 'aleo' is an old Portuguese term for a 'gaming stick' (as used in hockey or shuffleboard). It refers to a famous episode concerning Pedro de Menezes from shortly after the Conquest of Ceuta on September 2 1415 (commemorated on Ceuta Day). Pedro de Menezes was engaged in an outdoor game in the king's presence when a messenger arrived reporting an imminent Moroccan attack on Portuguese-held Ceuta. Menezes is said to have raised his gaming stick (aleo) and told the king that \\"with that stick alone\\" he could defend Ceuta from all the power of Morocco.\\"Eu s√≥ com este p√°u, sou capaz de defender Ceuta, de todo o poder dos mouros\\", as reported in Portugal antigo e moderno, 1878, p. 495.

And so even though it might preach love, it will not be loving; even it might talk about liberty, it will only conceive of a liberty conditioned by this or that which dominates it, and that liberty has every character of slavery: religion which linked his life to an external belief, which subjugates it\\".\\"El que sujeta su vida a un modelo exterior no puede tener otros amores que los que le preste el modelo elegido, al que levanta altar en su coraz√≥n como a deidad. Aunque predique amor, no ser√° amoroso; aunque hable de libertad, s√≥lo concebir√° la libertad condicionada por aqu√©l o aquello que lo domina, y esa libertad tiene todo el car√°cter de esclavitud: religi√≥n que at√≥ su vida a credo exterior, que lo subyuga.\\"Anarquismo by Miguel Gimenez Igualada Igualada exposes a radical pacifist view when he thinks that \\"When I say that through war humanity will never find peace, I sustain my affirmation in the fact that those who are more peaceful are the least believers, and so...one can affirm that the day of happiness in which war (religiosity is bellicosity) is extirpated from consciousness, peace will exists in the home of men, and since from consciousness these beliefs will not be extracted but only through an act of trascendental education, our labor is not of killing, but of education having it well present that to educate is not in any case domestication.\\"Cuando digo que por medio de la guerra no hallar√° nunca la paz la humanidad, fundamento mi afirmaci√≥n en el hecho de que los m√°s pac√≠ficos son los menos creyentes, por lo que, deduciendo, se puede asegurar que el d√≠a feliz y dichoso en que el acto b√©lico (religiosidad es belicosidad) sea extirpado de las conciencias, la paz existir√° en la casa del hombre, y como de las conciencias no se arrancan las creencias sino por un acto trascendentalmente educativo, nuestra labor no es de matanza, sino de educaci√≥n, teniendo bien presente que educar no es en ning√∫n caso domesticar.\\"Anarquismo by Miguel Gimenez Igualada And so he argues for an anarchism which will be \\"pacifist, poetic, which creates goodness, harmony and beauty, which cultivates a healthy sense of living in peace, sign of power and fertility...from there anyone which is un-harmonious (violent-warrior), everyone that will pretend, in any form, to dominate anyone of his similars, is not an anarchist, since the anarchist respects in such a way personal integrity, so that he could not make anyone a slave of his thoughts so as to turn him into an instrument of his, a man-tool.\\"\\"anarquismo pac√≠fico, po√©tico, creador de bondad, de armon√≠a y de belleza, cultivador de la sana alegr√≠a de vivir en paz, signo de potencia y de fecundidad...De ah√≠ que todo el que sea desarm√≥nico (violento, guerrero), todo el que pretenda, de alg√∫n modo o manera, dominar a uno cualquiera de sus semejantes, no sea anarquista, porque el anarquista respeta de tal modo la integridad personal de los seres humanos, que no puede hacer a ninguno esclavo de sus pensamientos para no convertirlo en instrumento suyo, en hombre-herramienta.\\"Anarquismo by Miguel Gimenez Igualada Igualada¬¥s emphasis was not on economics but his economic views could be understood in the following way. He sees \\"capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it State capitalism or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State.\\".\\"el capitalismo es s√≥lo el efecto del gobierno; desaparecido el gobierno, el capitalismo cae de su pedestal vertiginosamente...Lo que llamamos capitalismo no es otra cosa que el producto del Estado, dentro del cual lo √∫nico que se cultiva es la ganancia, bien o mal habida. Luchar, pues, contra el capitalismo es tarea in√∫til, porque sea Capitalismo de Estado o Capitalismo de Empresa, mientras el Gobierno exista, existir√° el capital que explota. La lucha, pero de conciencias, es contra el Estado.\\"Anarquismo by Miguel Gimenez Igualada His view on property and technocracy are as follows \\"¬øProperty? Is not a problem. Since when no one works for another, the profiteer from wealth disappears, just as government will disappear when no one pays attention to those who learned four things at universities and from that fact they pretend to govern men. Big industrial enterprises will be transformed by men in big associations in which everyone will work and enjoy the product of their work. And from those easy as well as beautiful problems anarchism deals with and he who puts them in practice and lives them are anarchists...The priority which without rest an anarchist must make is that in which no one has to exploit anyone, no man to no man, since that non-exploitation will lead to the limitation of property to individual needs\\".\\"¬øLa propiedad? ¬°Bah! No es problema. Porque cuando nadie trabaje para nadie, el acaparador de la riqueza desaparece, como ha de desaparecer el gobierno cuando nadie haga caso a los que aprendieron cuatro cosas en las universidades y por ese s√≥lo hecho pretenden gobernar a los hombres. Porque si en la tierra de los ciegos el tuerto es rey, en donde todos ven y juzgan y disciernen, el rey estorba. Y de lo que se trata es de que no haya reyes porque todos sean hombres. Las grandes empresas industriales las transformar√°n los hombres en grandes asociaciones donde todos trabajen y disfruten del producto de su trabajo. Y de esos tan sencillos como hermosos problemas trata el anarquismo y al que lo cumple y vive es al que se le llama anarquista...El hincapi√© que sin cansancio debe hacer el anarquista es el de que nadie debe explotar a nadie, ning√∫n hombre a ning√∫n hombre, porque esa no-explotaci√≥n llevar√≠a consigo la limitaci√≥n de la propiedad a las necesidades individuales.\\"Anarquismo by Miguel Gimenez Igualada  Works  * Dolor, 1944 * M√°s all√° del dolor, 1946 * Lobos en Espa√±a, 1946 * Un atentado, Los caminos del hombre, 1961 * Anarquismo, 1968 * El ni√±o y la escuela, Salmos, Stirner, 1968 * Trilog√≠a de oratoria, 1968  References  Category:Spanish expatriates in Mexico Category:Spanish anarchists Category:Individualist anarchists Category:Anarcho-pacifists Category:Egoist anarchists Category:People from the Province of Cuenca Category:Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo members Category:1888 births Category:1973 deaths ","title":"Miguel Gim√©nez Igualada"},{"id":"24719636","title":"List of TV Guide covers (2000s)"},{"id":"24719670","text":"Michael Klein (born January 23, 1952) is an artist‚Äôs agent and freelance consultant and curator for individuals, institutions and arts organizations, writer, curator, and program director currently operating Michael Klein Arts in New York City.

R.\\" Celski (, born July 17, 1990) is a retired American short track speed skater, three-time Olympian, and three-time medalist in the Winter Olympics. Celski has held a total of five combined Short Track World and Junior World Records throughout his career including the 500m and 5000m relay World Records as well as the 500m, 1000m and 3000m relay Junior World Records. Celski was a part of the team that broke and currently holds the World Record in the 5000m Relay established in Shanghai, China on November 12, 2017. On October 21, 2012, in Calgary, Canada, Celski became the first person to skate under the 40 second barrier in the 500m event with a time of 39.937 seconds.; He held the World Record for this distance for over 5 years from October 2012 to February 2018. At the 2010 Winter Olympics, Celski won bronze in the 1500 m and the 5000 m relay. Five months before the Olympics, Celski suffered a gruesome injury when he fell during a race and his right skate blade gashed his left thigh all the way to his femur bone and was uncertain if he would be able to skate again. Celski's breakthrough performance was at the 2009 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships where he won five medals (two gold, one silver, two bronze). Overall, Celski has won three gold medals, four silver medals, and four bronze medals at the World Championships. He also has one bronze medal at the World Team Championships and four medals (two gold, two bronze) at the World Junior Championships.

Celski finished second overall and was leading in points after the first two nights of the trials, but was injured during a crash in the semifinals of the 500 m race where his right skate sliced into his left leg; he did not skate in the second 1000 m races. His injury required emergency surgery, 60 stitches, and five months of rehabilitation with the help of Eric Heiden. Celski was unsure if he would ever compete again. During the 1000 m time trial, Celski won with a personal best of 1:23.981. Celski, along with Ohno, Jordan Malone, Travis Jayner and Simon Cho were the top five finishers at the trials. Afterwards, Ohno said about the nominated team: \\"This is the strongest team we've ever had. I feel really good about how we will do in the next Olympics\\". Games At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Celski won a pair of bronze medals. One in the 1500 m and another in the 5000 m relay.

Rude (1881‚Äì1962) was an officer in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey‚Äîone of the ancestor organizations of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -- and the United States Navy. He served as Chief of the Division of Coastal Surveys in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. A NOAA ship was named for him. Early life Rude (pronounced ROO - dee) was born in Sharps, Virginia, on September 13, 1881, and received his education at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland. Career Early U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey career, 1903-1917 Gilbert T. RudeRude entered the Coast and Geodetic Survey as a deck officer on January 19, 1903. Upon entering service in the Survey, he served two years aboard the survey schooner USC&GS; Matchless, then in 1905 transferred to a two-year tour of duty in the Philippine Islands. In 1907, he began an eight- year tour as commanding officer of the survey ship USC&GS; Taku in the Territory of Alaska. From 1915 to 1917, he commanded the survey ship USC&GS; Isis on the United States East Coast. World War I U.S. Navy service, 1917-1919 When the United States entered World War I in 1917, he was transferred to the United States Navy, serving first as commanding officer of USS Isis‚Äîthe former USC&GS; Isis, temporarily in U.S. Navy service in the New York City area as a cruiser squadron flagship‚Äîand then as navigating officer on the troop transport USS Mercury (ID-3012). U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey career from 1919 Rude was transferred back to the Coast and Geodetic Survey in March 1919 and became Chief of what was then the Section of Tides and Currents, which under his guidance soon was upgraded to a division. In his early boyhood he had been interested in a \\"gadget\\" installed on the waterfront near his home which measured the tides, and during his service as Chief of Tides and Currents, his interest in this first hobby bore fruit in his division, as it started the standard tide gauge and developed a new portable automatic tide gauge. He wrote many articles and publications relating to tides and currents, and for one entitled \\"Tides and Their Engineering Aspects\\" the American Society of Civil Engineers presented him with the Norman Medal in 1929. From August 1928 to March 1931, Rude was inspector of construction of the Coast and Geodetic survey ship USC&GS; Hydrographer, which he delivered to Washington, D.C. in April 1931. He then became Chief of Coastal Surveys, which position he held until retirement. Some of the outstanding developments and improvements of the Division of Coastal Surveys during his tour as its chief were the advancement of echo sounding; the development of submarine valley surveys; the use of taut wire; the use of radio acoustic ranging; the study and development of radar for use in surveying; the construction of the new survey ships USC&GS; Explorer, USC&GS; Pathfinder (OSS-30), USC&GS; Lester Jones (ASV-79), USC&GS; Patton (ASV-80), USC&GS; Hilgard, and USC&GS; Wainwright, and the acquisition of the survey ships USC&GS; Parker, USC&GS; Stirni, and USC&GS; Sosbee. Captain Rude took an active part in scientific meetings and attended several of the International Hydrographic Bureau meetings at Monaco. His invention, the Mariner's Practical Star Finder and Identifier, was purchased by the U.S. Navy and is furnished to all its vessels. He retired with the rank of captain. Captain Rude was a member of several engineering and scientific societies, including the American Society of Civil Engineers, Philosophical Society of Washington, the Association of American Geographers, the Society of American Military Engineers, the International Aeroarctic Society, and others. During his service in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Captain Rude was untiring in his efforts to improve surveying methods and equipment and he was always alert to encourage others to do likewise. Death Rude died in 1962. Namesake The survey ship NOAAS Rude (S 590), in service with the Coast and Geodetic Survey as USC&GS; Rude (ASV 90) from 1967 to 1970 and with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as NOAAS Rude from 1970 to 2008, was named for Rude.

History Castle of Alvor The Facho Tower and Matriz Church, medieval symbols of Alvor's history Alvor was founded in 436 B.C. by the Carthaginian General An√≠bal Barca as a commercial port, which he named Portus Hannibalis.David J. J. Evans (2004), p.470 The settlement grew around the sea, near the place called Vila Velha, where a Celtic castro dominated the river mouth during the Iron Age. It is likely that it was the Roman colony of Ipses, which was authorized to mint currency, and was absorbed during the Roman era. Taken by the Moors in 716, the settlement began to be referred to as Albur, and gained an impressive castle, with only vestiges remaining. Middle Ages This bastion was conquered on 3 June 1189, by the forces of King Sancho I of Portugal, with help from Crusader forces. It was retaken two years, and definitively reconquered in 1250. Rebuilt by King Denis in 1300, it served for 500 years the coastal defences against attacks by pirates and privateers until it was destroyed in 1755 by the tsunami and earthquake that devastated Lisbon. By royal decree of Afonso V, dated 22 May 1469, it was raised to the status of Countship, under the seigneurial title bestowed to Afonso, Count of Faro. But, this title did not extend beyond this period, as the Count of Faro was implicated in a conspiracy against John II of Portugal (in 1483-84), and it reverted to the Crown. During the reign of John II, Alvor continued to receive patronage, the king dying on 25 October 1495 in the palace of √Ålvaro de Ata√≠de after catching a chill in Monchique (the residence, which was situated on Rua do Po√ßo, was located near the supposed hydrothermal springs of Caldas de Monchique). The Prince Regent ordered, in the name of Manuel of Portugal, the elevation of Alvor to vila (town) on 28 February 1495, which was confirmed in a secondary diploma on 28 December 1498. In the closing decades of the 15th century Alvor was a centre of the Jewish community in Portugal. Monarchy King Sebastian visited the municipality on 27 January 1573, staying on the 24-25 in Alvor, where he visited the houses (now in ruins) where in 1495 King John II died. At that time the alcaide already pertained to the Count of Odemira. The first foral was issued during the reign of Philip II of Spain during the Iberian Union on 13 December 1585. Friar Jo√£o de S√£o Jos√© declared, in 1577, that Alvor was a transit port for fully loaded ships (carracks and battleships), while Fernandes Serr√£o (around 1606) referred to settlement of 240 homes, a heavily defended by its fort, that helped to serve a local fishing fleet and local exports. There is also mention of the localities of Montes de Baixo and Montes de Cima, colloquially known as the Freires since there were a preponderance of residents from that family living in the region. The Matriz Church was constructed in the early part of the 16th century by Ataide family, alcades of the vila, donatorios with many privileges and lands (it was likely √Ålvaro de Ataide's son who initiated the construction of the church in 1497). In 1652 the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia was first erected in the community. By royal charter, issued by Peter II, the vila of Alvor was once again raised to Countship (4 February 1683) under Francisco de T√°vora, a nobleman who occupied several official duties and distinguished himself during the Battle of Montes Claros. The title was later passed on to Bernardo de T√°vora, and then Lu√≠s Bernardo de T√°vora, eventually extinguished after the T√°vora affair. The parish and the T√°vora assets were incorporated in the House of the Queens ( until 1773, when these were integrated into the parish when it was annexed into the municipality of Portim√£o. Although the 1755 earthquake (1 November) resulted in the death of only one person, it was responsible for the destruction of homes, the fort, the Facho tower, and the chapel of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda,F. Tedim Pedrosa and J. Goncalves (2008) p. 60‚Äì61 in addition to altering the river's course. Its effects also resulted in the decrease of the local population by 1000 residents; by 1900 the population included less than 3014 souls, owing to the effects of the earthquake. Republic On 14 April 1988 the village once again attained the title of vila, under decree 42/88, owing to the economic, cultural and social development. Geography The parish of Alvor is located along the southern coast of Portim√£o surrounded by its municipal neighbours Mexilhoeira Grande and Portim√£o, and the municipality of Lagos (parish of Odi√°xere). The Ria de Alvor (Alvor Estuary) is located between the towns of Lagos and Portim√£o. Covering 1700 hectares it includes a diverse mix of habitats of brushwood, forest and agricultural land, comprising the estuary, dunes, marshes and salt-pans, and also the Quinta da Rocha and Abicada peninsula. Ria de Alvor was included in the Natura 2000 network of sites, due to the presence of species and habitats considered worthy of protection at the European level. The Natura 2000 network recognizes the need for protection of the following: *Priority habitats: Coastal lagoons, fixed coastal dunes with herbaceous vegetation (grey dunes) *Priority species: Camphor Thyme Thymus camphoratus *Other features of EU Importance: 13 habitats, including the estuary, spartina swards, salt meadows and embryo dunes.

When the War of 1812 broke out, he was a colonel in the 13th Regiment of Kentucky Militia.http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=3076 Military service In the spring of 1813, Dudley was under command of General Green Clay. Clay's forces numbered some 1,200 strong as they travelled up the Maumee River to Fort Meigs. Clay's forces arrived at the fort on May 4, 1813, in the midst of the Siege of Fort Meigs. General William Henry Harrison sent a courier to General Clay ordering him to take an offensive against the British battery on the other side of the Maumee to drive them away and spike (disable) their cannons. General Clay left this task up to Colonel Dudley and a force of 800 men. On the morning of May 5, Dudley made his assault on the British and succeeded in driving them off. After this, however, Clay's plan fell apart. The soldier with the tools to spike the cannons had accidentally landed on the opposite side of the river. In desperation, Dudley's men tried with some success to spike the guns with their bayonets and ramrods. Meanwhile, the Indians became a problem when they opened fire on the Kentuckians from inside the woods. Determined to avenge the Kentuckians who had been slaughtered by the Indians after their capture in the River Raisin Massacre, the Kentucky charged into the woods against their officers' orders. The Indians drew the militiamen further and further into the woods, where they were finally surrounded by the Indians and the British Army. Forced to surrender, the Kentuckians were marched downriver to the ruins of Fort Miami. Soon, the Native Americans began firing at random into the prisoners, killing several of them. They then began tomahawking the prisoners and stealing their belongings. Several British officers, including Colonel Henry Procter, stood watching some distance away, but they made no attempt to stop the massacre. At least 30 prisoners were murdered before Tecumseh arrived himself. He immediately drew his tomahawk and stood between the prisoners and their attackers. The Indian leader called Procter a woman for being afraid to end the slaughter of the helpless prisoners. \\"You are unfit to command,\\" he said.\\"Go and put on petticoats!\\"Men of Patriotism Courage & Enterprise; by Larry L.

User interface  Spring Roo's main user interface is a command-line shell. The shell provides both a command-line interface and also a mechanism to host plug-ins (which are called \\"add-ons\\" in Roo). One key design goal of Roo is to ensure a user can continue to work in a \\"natural way\\", which typically means using their preferred integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor for most tasks. As such Roo is often loaded in a separate window to the IDE or text editor, and will monitor the file system for changes made by the user outside of Roo. A startup-time scan of a user's project is also performed to determine any changes that may have been made while Roo was not running. The user interface shell supports extensive usability features including command-line completion (i.e. press TAB), online help, hinting (a form of context-sensitive help) and contextual awareness (which provides automatic inference of likely intentions based on recent activity). This allows a user to create a new software project via the Roo shell, or use Roo on an existing project. The following is an example of the commands used by Roo to create a new application plus the Spring Boot Maven plugin run goal to compile and run the application using an embedded HTTP server: $ mkdir hello $ cd hello $ roo.sh roo> project setup --topLevelPackage com.foo roo> jpa setup --provider HIBERNATE --database HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY roo> entity jpa --class ~.domain.Timer roo> field string --fieldName message --notNull roo> repository jpa --all roo> service --all roo> web mvc setup roo> web mvc view setup --type THYMELEAF roo> web mvc controller --all --responseType THYMELEAF roo> web mvc controller --all --pathPrefix /api roo> quit $ mvn spring-boot:run The above commands did not need to be typed in full, but rather were completed using TAB. Additionally, the \\"hint\\" command could have been used to acquire help at any time.  Architecture  While there are many ways that software can automatically generate code,\\"InfoQ: Role of Code Generation in Java Development\\" by Srini Penchikala; Dated 2009-9-3. Roo operates by generating AspectJ inter-type declarations (otherwise known as mixins or introductions). This achieves separation of concerns, as the code maintained by Roo is in a different compilation unit from the code a user writes. This means Roo can incrementally modify the AspectJ inter-type declarations that it needs to and leave all other files intact.\\"InfoQ: Introduction to Spring Roo 1.0.0 Video Presentation\\", by Ben Alex (lead of Spring Roo at SpringSource); Retrieved 2010-2-21.\\"JAX Italia 2009 Conference: Spring Roo\\" by Massimiliano Dess√¨; Retrieved 2010-2-21.\\"Philadelphia Java User Group: Spring Roo\\" by Ken Rimple; Retrieved 2010-2-21. Spring Roo uses add-ons to provide all the functionality within and on top of an OSGi runtime system based on Apache Felix.  Base add-ons  There are numerous commands available in Roo, depending on which \\"base add-ons\\" (those which ship with Roo) and \\"third-party add-ons\\" (those that do not ship with Roo) have been installed. The base add-ons shipping with Roo 2.0.x include: * Add-On Creator: enables easy creation of third-party Roo add-ons * Backup: enables backups to be made to a ZIP file by typing \`backup\` * Bean Info: exposes JavaBean property, accessor and mutator metadata (primarily used by other add-ons) * Configurable: introduces Spring Framework's @Configurable annotation (primarily used by other add-ons) * Database reverse engineering: allows incremental reverse engineering of relational databases * Data on Demand: provides seed data that is compliant with JSR 303 (JavaBean Validation) annotations present in entities * DTO: extensive support for automatically maintaining Data Transfer Objects * Email: simplifies setup of SMTP-based emails and mail sender support via Javamail * Entity: extensive support for automatically maintaining Java Persistence API @Entity classes * Java Bean: automatically maintains JavaBean getters/setters for classes with an @RooJavaBean annotation * JDBC: encapsulates OSGi- compliant access to JDBC drivers shipped in different bundles (primarily used by other add-ons) * JMS: simplifies connecting to a JMS provider (or embedding ActiveMQ) and sending/receiving JMS messages * JPA: installs a specified JPA provider and sets up JDBC accordingly * JSON: adds JSON related serialization and deserialization methods to POJOs * Logging: sets up Log4j, including command-based log level configuration * Pluralization: provides pluralization of nouns (primarily used by other add-ons) * Property Editor: manages property editors, as required by Spring MVC * Property File: manages Java properties files and provides shell commands to read, set and remove property values * Security: sets up Spring Security, including login pages, filters and dependencies * Test: produces JUnit integration tests for project classes * ToString: produces a valid toString() method for any class with the @RooToString annotation * Web Flow: installs the Spring Web Flow and creates a default flow * Web MVC: maintains the view layer based on Spring MVC plus Thymeleaf templates and the RESTful API * WS: produces SOAP services and SOAP clients  Roo core modules  Roo also includes a core set of modules that provide a hosted execution environment for different add-ons.

William Saville Kent reported spore-masses of it in such an infusion in 1880.William Saville Kent: A manual of the infusoria, including a description of all known flagellate, ciliate, and tentaculiferous protozoa, British and foreign and an account of the organization and affinities of the sponges, Vol. 1, 1880, p. 135-142 Taxonomy and history The first valid description (as Monas lens) was published by Otto Friedrich M√ºller in 1773.Otto Friedrich M√ºller: Vermivm Terrestrium Et Fluviatilium, Seu Animalium Infusoriorum, Helminthicorum Et Testaceorum, Non Marinorum, Succincta Historia, Vol. 1, Ps. 1, Leipzig 1773, p. 26 William Saville Kent placed it in the genus Heteromita in 1880. Edwin Klebs moved it to Bodo in 1892, but this was rejected by H.M. Woodcock, who removed the species from Bodo and made it the type species of Heteromastix. David J. Patterson and Michael Z√∂lffel found Woodcock's description to be insufficient and established the genus Kamera for Kamera lens in 1991, creating a play on words in the binomial's resemblance to 'camera lens'. Due to lacking ultrastructural or molecular biological data, the species' rank is uncertain; thus it is placed as incertae sedis in the Eukaryota. This species has been provisionally placed in the Ochrophyta. The taxonomy of this group is currently under revision so the position of the genus Kamera should not be regarded as being settled at the moment.

The museum's collection included military vehicles, missiles, aircraft and over 5000 smaller aviation artifacts. An extensive archive of books, magazines, manuals, photos, documents and blueprints was preserved within the Quonset Air Museum. Notable aircraft in the collection included the last surviving Curtiss XF15C mixed propulsion prototype and a twin tail C-1A Trader. This one of a kind aircraft had been fitted with twin tails and radome (but without associated electronics) to serve the aerodynamic prototype for the E-1 Tracer Electronic Counter Measure aircraft. This C-1A has the distinction of being the last aircraft to fly from Naval Air Station Quonset Point upon its closure in 1974. The museum housed several Vietnam era combat aircraft as well as the legendary Grumman F-14 Tomcat. History The museum recovered an F6F-5 Hellcat from Martha's Vineyard on 4 December 1993. It became the subject of a court battle after the U.S. Navy claimed that the aircraft had been salvaged without their permission. Eventually, a settlement was reached where the museum received the aircraft on loan from the Navy. An Antonov An-2 at the museum was given to the Antonov Foundation in 2004. The following year David H. Payne Sr. became the museum president. The museum occupied Painting Hangar #488 located at what was once the Naval Air Station Quonset Point. This 50,000 sq. ft. facility was one of only three existing specialized wood and brick hangars built during WWII. Heavy snowfall in March 2015 partially collapsed the building's roof and the hangar was condemned. In January 2016, plans for a new museum were announced. The museum was originally supposed to leave by April 2, but it was given an extension. Later, in June, a $4 million request for state funding failed to materialize. On December 16, 2016, it was announced that the museum would not reopen.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 24, 2009. In the episode, Leslie conducts surveillance on a community garden in an attempt to find out who planted marijuana there. The episode was written by Rachel Axler and directed by Seth Gordon. It marked the first in a series of guest appearances by stand-up comedian Louis C.K. as Dave Sanderson, a Pawnee police officer who develops a romantic interest in Leslie. A scene in which Sanderson arrests Tom Haverford in his own van mirrors the real-life controversial 2009 arrest of Henry Louis Gates. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 4.22 million households, an 800,000-household drop from the previous week's season premiere, \\"Pawnee Zoo\\". \\"The Stakeout\\" received generally positive reviews, with several commentators saying it marked a continued improvement over the first Parks and Recreation season. Plot Ann (Rashida Jones), who is preparing for her first date with Mark (Paul Schneider), worriedly asks Leslie (Amy Poehler) if she has any reservations, since Leslie previously had feelings for him. Leslie insists she is fine. Later, Leslie and Tom (Aziz Ansari) visit a community garden in the Pawnee pit, where they find what appears to be marijuana. That night, Leslie and Tom don black and watch the pit from a van. Leslie eventually spots Ann and Mark leaving for their date, and starts snapping photos of them. Later, Leslie and Tom see Ann's ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt) in the pit. They assume he is the kingpin, but he insists he is actually living in the pit and eating the vegetables from the garden. Back at city hall, Ron (Nick Offerman) remains immobile in his chair all day due to a hernia which causes excruciating pain if he moves. Ron remains immobile in his seat well into the night, until the janitors turn the lights off on him. The intern, April (Aubrey Plaza), returns to check on him, and wheels Ron out to the car on his office chair to bring him to the hospital. Leslie and Andy walk off to get fast food. Back at the pit, Tom is locked out of his van and tries to break back in. Ann and Mark return from their date and call the police after they see him, assuming him to be a prowler. Officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.) arrives and confronts Tom, who mouths off at Dave until he places him under arrest. Leslie goes to the police station. Initially angry, she eventually confesses about the marijuana. Dave releases Tom, who thanks Leslie for sticking up for him. The next day, Leslie and Dave go to the garden, but he finds no marijuana. Tom tells Leslie that Mark is an idiot, and she can do better. Dave guesses Leslie orchestrated the whole thing to spy on Ann and Mark. Later, Dave privately admits he is attracted to Leslie. Production Louis C.K. first appears in this episode as a recurring character Officer Dave Sanderson. \\"The Stakeout\\" was written by Rachel Axler and directed by Seth Gordon. It marked the first in a series of guest appearances by stand-up comedian Louis C.K. He played Dave Sanderson, a Pawnee police officer who develops a romantic interest in Leslie, and speaks about intimate feelings in a deadpan, technical tone of voice. C.K. improvised the line, \\"I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate\\" during his discussion about Leslie near the end of the episode. During a scene in the van, Tom Haverford tells Leslie he changed his name because his original name was too foreign sounding for a career in politics. When Leslie points about U.S. President Barack Obama has a foreign-sounding name, Tom gets upset. The reference to Obama's name was originally featured in a scene that was cut from Parks and Recreation pilot episode. Offerman, who barely moves and is often quiet throughout the episode, said he learned to use humor amid silence while serving as an altar boy and lector at his church. Offerman said, \\"I had a cousin in the congregation, and I would speak with the utmost, august stoicism, and everyone would think I was a very effective speaker. But he knew I was being facetious. He'd get in trouble for cracking up.\\" Within a week of the episode's original broadcast, three deleted scenes from \\"The Stakeout\\" were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first 75-second clip, a panicked Leslie asks Tom whether the marijuana plant could be a \\"non-marijuana weed\\". In the second 80-second clip, Dave says he hates arresting people because he \\"never wants to go\\". He also discusses his strategies for calming people down, including using a soft voice, eye contact and tasing them. In the third minute-long clip, Ron tries unsuccessfully to eat his lunch and throw away the garbage without moving. Cultural references controversial real-life 2009 arrest of Henry Louis Gates (pictured). The confrontation between Tom Haverford and Dave Sanderson before Tom's arrest in his own van mirrored the real life arrest of Henry Louis Gates, a black Harvard University professor who was arrested after police mistakenly thought he was breaking into his own home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The arrest received national attention. When a police officer asked Gates to step outside, he replied, \\"I'll speak to your mama outside,\\" which was parodied in \\"The Stakeout\\" when Dave asked Tom to step out of the van and he responded, \\"I'll step out of your mama's van!\\" During the opening scene, Tom pretends to know the names of all the plants in a community garden and assigns them all fake names based on real-life rappers. He refers to one plant as Souljaboy Tellems, a reference to the performer Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, and another as Ludacrises, a reference to rapper Ludacris.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbVNq-B70ho Reception In its original American broadcast on September 24, 2009, \\"The Stakeout\\" was seen by 4.22 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research. It constituted a nearly 800,000-household drop from the previous week's season premiere, \\"Pawnee Zoo\\". The episode received a 1.8 rating/5 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49, the lowest rating for Season Two so far. The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall said although the quality of Parks and Recreations was improving, season two was struggling in the ratings based on the lower quality of the season one episodes. Sepinwall said, \\"There's a school of thought in the TV business that it's harder to get back viewers who watched and left than it is to start small and attract new viewers over time.\\" \\"The Stakeout\\" received generally positive reviews. Sepinwall said the episode was funny, but also notable because it developed a stronger personal connection between Leslie and Tom, and because it featured more references to topical events like the Henry Gates controversy. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said \\"The Stakeout\\" was \\"the best Parks & Recreation episode by a long shot\\". He said Poehler seemed more at ease with the Leslie character, and thought \\"the intersection of business and personal stress\\" served the episode well. He also praised the supporting cast and particularly the Ron Swanson subplot. Matt Fowler of IGN said with \\"The Stakeout\\", the second season of Parks and Recreation continued to be \\"significantly funnier\\" than the first season. Fowler said he thought the pairing between Leslie and Tom helped ground both characters, and said he was interested to see Leslie dealt with the growing romance between Ann and Mark. Entertainment Weekly writer Henning Fog said \\"The Stakeout\\" showed growth improvement for the series, and praised the guest performance of Louis C.K. Fog said the disparate pairing of Leslie and Tom, Mark and Ann, and Ron and April, created a sense that the characters \\"really knew each other [and] had lives outside of Leslie's immediate orbit\\". Chicago Tribune columnist Maureen Ryan particularly praised the performance of Offerman, of whom she said, \\"His pained reactions and stoic silence are hilarious.\\" DVD release \\"The Stakeout\\", along with the other 23 second season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010. The DVD included deleted scenes for each episode.

The population in 2011 was 56,596,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 1307.08 km¬≤. It is the seat of the √âvora District. The present Mayor is Carlos Pinto de S√° of the CDU coalition. The municipal holiday is 29 June. Due to its well-preserved old town centre, still partially enclosed by medieval walls, and many monuments dating from various historical periods, including a Roman Temple, √âvora is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is also a member of the Most Ancient European Towns Network. √âvora being inland leads it to being one of Portugal's hottest cities prone to strong heat waves. Even so, it is milder than areas farther inland across the Spanish border. √âvora is ranked number two in the Portuguese most livable cities survey of living conditions published yearly by Expresso.Classifica√ß√£o Expresso das melhores cidades portuguesas para viver em 2007, Expresso It was ranked first in a study concerning competitiveness of the 18 Portuguese district capitals, according to a 2006 study made by University of Minho economic researchers. History The Foral of √âvora of 1501, when the city was favoured by Manuel I of Portugal. A depiction of √âvora in 1503, when the city was blooming with Manueline riches.  Early history  √âvora has a history dating back more than five millennia. It was known as Ebora by the Celtici, a tribal confederacy, south of the Lusitanians (and of Tagus river), who made the town their regional capital. The etymological origin of the name Ebora is from the ancient Celtic word ebora/ebura, plural genitive of the word eburos (yew), the name of a species of tree, so its name means \\"of the yew trees.\\" The city of York, in northern England, at the time of the Roman Empire, was called Eboracum/Eburacum, after the ancient Celtic place name *Eborakon (Place of Yew Trees), so the old name of York is etymologically related to the city of √âvora. Alternative hypotheses are that the name is derived from oro, aurum, (gold) as the Romans had extensive gold mining in Portugal; or it may have been named after ivory workers because ebur (genitive eboris) was Latin for ivory. It may have been capital of the kingdom of Astolpas. Roman rule  See Ebora Liberalitas Julia for more on Roman Evora. The Romans conquered the town in 57 BC and expanded it into a walled town. Vestiges from this period (city walls and ruins of Roman baths) still remain. Julius Caesar called it Liberalitas Julia (Julian generosity). The city grew in importance because it lay at the junction of several important routes. During his travels through Gaul and Lusitania, Pliny the Elder also visited this town and mentioned it in his book Naturalis Historia as Ebora Cerealis, because of its many surrounding wheat fields. In those days, √âvora became a flourishing city. Its high rank among municipalities in Roman Hispania is clearly shown by many inscriptions and coins. The monumental Corinthian temple in the centre of the town dates from the first century and was probably erected in honour of emperor Augustus. In the fourth century, the town had already a bishop, named Quintianus. During the barbarian invasions, √âvora came under the rule of the Visigothic king Leovigild in 584. The town was later raised to the status of a cathedral city. Nevertheless, this was a time of decline and very few artifacts from this period remain.  Moorish rule  In 715, the city was conquered by the Moors under Tariq ibn-Ziyad who called it Yaburah Ÿäÿßÿ®ÿ±ÿ©. During the Moorish rule (715‚Äì1165), the town, part of the Taifa of Badajoz, slowly began to prosper again and developed into an agricultural center with a fortress and a mosque. The present character of the city is evidence of the Moorish influence. During that time, several notables hailed from Evora, including Abd al-Majid ibn Abdun Al-Yaburi ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¨ŸäÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπÿ®ÿØŸàŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸäÿßÿ®ÿ±Ÿä, a poet whose diwan still survives to this day.  Reconquest  √âvora was wrested from the Moors through a surprise attack by Gerald the Fearless (Geraldo Sem Pavor) in September 1165. The town came under the rule of the Portuguese king Afonso I in 1166. It then flourished as one of the most dynamic cities in the Kingdom of Portugal during the Middle Ages, especially in the 15th century. The court of the first and second dynasties resided here for long periods, constructing palaces, monuments and religious buildings. √âvora became the scene for many royal weddings and a site where many important decisions were made.  Manueline favour  War of Two Brothers. Particularly thriving during the Avis Dynasty (1385‚Äì1580), especially under the reign of Manuel I and John III, √âvora became a major centre for the humanities (Andr√© de Resende - buried in the cathedral) and artists, such as the sculptor Nicolau Chanterene; the painters Crist√≥v√£o de Figueiredo and Greg√≥rio Lopes; the composers Manuel Cardoso and Duarte Lobo; the chronicler Duarte Galv√£o; and the father of Portuguese drama, Gil Vicente. √âvora also held a large part of the slave population of Portugal. Nicolas Clenard, a Flemish tutor at the Portuguese court, exclaimed in 1535 that \\"In √âvora, it was as if I had been carried off to a city in hell: everywhere I only meet blacks.\\" The city became the seat of an archbishopric in 1540. The university was founded by the Jesuits in 1559, and it was here that great European Masters such as the Flemish humanists Nicolaus Clenardus (Nicolaas Cleynaerts) (1493‚Äì1542), Johannes Vasaeus (Jan Was) (1511‚Äì1561) and the theologian Luis de Molina passed on their knowledge. In the 18th century, the Jesuits, who had spread intellectual and religious enlightenment since the 16th century, were expelled from Portugal, the university was closed in 1759 by the Marquis of Pombal, and √âvora went into decline. The university was only reopened in 1973.  Recent history  View of a street in √âvora. The Battle of √âvora was fought on 29 July 1808 during the Peninsular War. An outnumbered Portuguese- Spanish force of 2,500, assisted by poorly armed peasant militiamen, tried to stop a French-Spanish division commanded by Louis Henri Loison but it was routed. Led by the hated Loison, known as Maneta or One-Hand, the French went on to storm the town which was defended by soldiers, militiamen and armed townsmen. Breaking into the town, the attackers slaughtered combatants and non-combatants alike before thoroughly pillaging the place. The French inflicted as many as 8,000 casualties while suffering only 290 of their own.Jac Weller, Wellington in the Peninsula, Kaye & Ward, p34 In 1834, √âvora was the site of the surrender of the forces of King Miguel I, which marked the end of the Liberal Wars. The many monuments erected by major artists of each period now testify to √âvora's lively cultural and rich artistic and historical heritage. The variety of architectural styles (Romanesque, Gothic, Manueline, Renaissance, Baroque), the palaces and the picturesque labyrinth of squares and narrow streets of the city centre are all part of the rich heritage of this museum-city. Geography Physical geography √âvora (altitude 300 m) is situated in Alentejo, a large region of wide plains on the south of Portugal, bordered on the North by the Tagus River and on the South by the region of Algarve. The city is from the capital city Lisbon, and from Badajoz at the Spanish border. It is the chief city of the region. The seat of the municipality is the city of √âvora, composed by the civil parishes of √âvora (S√£o Mamede, S√©, S√£o Pedro e Santo Ant√£o) in the historical centre and the urban parishes of Bacelo e Senhora da Sa√∫de and Malagueira e Horta das Figueiras outside the ancient city walls where most of the population in fact reside. The remaining civil parishes in the municipality are rural or suburban and do not form part of the city for statistic purposes. The city's historical centre has about 4,000 buildings and an area of . Climate √âvora has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csa) with hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters. Its location in the interior of southern Portugal makes it subject to frequent droughts and desertification. As is typical of the interior Alentejo, √âvora is prone to severe heat extremes with an all-time record of . However, the average summer high is usually around , which is significantly less severe heat than the one found in nearby Andalusia, Spain. This is due to low-scale maritime effects caused by its relative proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, which also causes seasonal lag predominantly during the warmer period, with night-time temperatures being milder in September than June as well as in October compared with May. Frosts in winter are frequent but not usually severe, snow falling only twice a decade. Human geography Jardim Diana, downtown √âvora √âvora is a pleasant medium-sized city and has numerous monuments. Due to its long history, monuments and buildings are its main attraction to outsiders. However, there are numerous \\"Festas Populares\\" celebrating saints, holidays, \\"Feiras\\" (fairs) and cultural events (such as televised musical presentations) sponsored by the municipality and other organizationsRegi√£o de Turismo de √âvora in Portuguese. The municipality consists of the following 12 civil parishes: * Bacelo e Senhora da Sa√∫de * Canaviais * √âvora (S√£o Mamede, S√©, S√£o Pedro e Santo Ant√£o) * Malagueira e Horta das Figueiras * Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa do Divor * Nossa Senhora da Tourega e Nossa Senhora de Guadalupe * Nossa Senhora de Machede * S√£o Bento do Mato * S√£o Man√ßos e S√£o Vicente do Pigeiro * S√£o Miguel de Machede * S√£o Sebasti√£o da Giesteira e Nossa Senhora da Boa F√© * Torre de Coelheiros International relations √âvora is twinned with: * Angra do Hero√≠smo, Portugal, since 1986 * Chartres, France, since 2003 * Qazvin, Iran, since 2016 * Island of Mozambique, Mozambique, since 1997 * Suzdal, Russia, since 1986 √âvora is also part of the Most Ancient European Towns Network. Economy Largo das Portas da Moura √âvora is the chief city of the Alentejo region, and plays a role as an important agricultural and services center. It is home to several institutions with great importance for the region, like the state-run University of √âvora and district hospital. √âvora has tried to develop the aerospace sector, and has been chosen to host the Portuguese Aeronautical Cluster after Brazilian aircraft manufacturer giant Embraer decided to establish in the city two factories (one of metallic structures and other of composite structures) for the production of aircraft parts along with its European Engineering Center. The city's aeronautical park, which includes an aerodrome, is about to receive a number of other investments related to the aeronautical industry, amongst which the most noteworthy investments are the ones of Lauak and Mecachrome. Due to its extensive historical and cultural importance, √âvora, as well as the surrounding area, has seen in the past few years a great increase in the tourism sector, which fomented the creation of many hotels, bed-and-breakfasts and various other styles of accommodation. Some of its most visited sites include the Roman Temple of √âvora, the Chapel of Bones, the Cathedral of √âvora, √âvora's Museum and its historical centre. Transport √âvora can be reached by bus or train, with the construction of a high speed train link to Lisbon and Madrid is planned. There is a small airfield, the √âvora Municipal Airport, currently without commercial airline service. The closest major airports are: Beja, Lisbon, Faro and Badajoz.

A rather large church three-nave church, includes a valuable altar antependium from the 13th century in bas relief. In 1483, Fernando II, the Duke of Braganza was executed in the square, in the presence of his brother-in-law king John II. This square also witnessed thousands of autos-da-f√© during the Inquisition; there were 22000 condemnations, during the course of 200 years.Guia de Portugal. Estremadura, Alentejo, Algarve. Ed. F. C.

History German and Japanese village, aerial view, 1943 German village in 1994, oblique angle. The roof construction was added in the 1960s Dresden after the 1945 firebombing raid Dugway was a high-security testing facility for chemical and biological weapons. The purpose of the replicas of German homes, which were repeatedly rebuilt after being intentionally burned down, was to perfect tactics in the fire bombing of German residential areas during World War II. The U.S. Army employed German √©migr√© architects such as Erich Mendelsohn to create copies as accurate as possible of the dwellings of densely populated poorer quarters of Berlin. The main goal was to find a tactic to achieve a fire storm in the city center. The architects who worked on the German village and on the Japanese equivalent also included Konrad Wachsmann and Antonin Raymond. The U.S. Army also hired Standard Oil Development Company to assist in the practical testing and construction. Erich Mendelsohn and Konrad Wachsmann advised on construction techniques and materials.Robin Schuldenfrei, Atomic Dwelling: Anxiety, Domesticity, and Postwar Architecture, pages 117, 118 Paul Zucker, Hans Knoll and George Hartmueller advised on designing authentic interior furnishings.

It was canceled when it proved to be unstable, structurally unsound and its generators were not strong enough to fully power its gun turrets. With the advent of jet-powered bombers, Soviet military planners decided that it simply was not worth devoting the necessary resources to fix its numerous problems. Development After the end of World War II the Tupolev OKB decided to continue its development of long-range variants of the Tu-2 which had begun with the unsuccessful Tu-2D during the war. Internally designated as the ANT-69, it was originally planned to use the new Shvetsov M-93 radial engines, but this was changed to the Shvetsov ASh-82M when the M-93 engine was delayed. It was to be armed with Berezin B-20 cannon on the existing mounts. The fuselage nose was completely revised in response to complaints by the VVS about the Tu-2. The navigator was given a seat and the nose was extensively glazed to improve his view. The cockpit was revised to seat the pilots side by side rather than in tandem and the ventral gunner was also given a seat. The revision of the nose caused the twin tails to be enlarged to offset the greater area ahead of the aircraft's center of gravity.Gordon, p. 94 The defensive armament's gun turrets were electrically powered and the ventral gunner was given a remotely-controlled turret. He sighted the turret through prominent blisters in the rear fuselage. The copilot could turn his seat 180¬∞ and manned a B-20 gun in the rear of the pilot's compartment.Gunston, p. 128 The Tu-8 was fitted with an OPB-4S Norden-type bombsight and had its maximum bombload increased to . It was intended to be able to carry mines or torpedoes for service with Soviet Naval Aviation.Gordon, pp. 94‚Äì95 This concept was approved by the Council of Ministers on 11 March 1947. The ANT-62T prototype torpedo bomber was modified as the prototype of the Tu-8. That aircraft's ASh-82FN engines were retained rather than use the ASh-83M engines originally planned. It was first flown on 24 May 1947 and kept on manufacturer's trials until 20 April 1948. These trials were prolonged by the numerous difficulties experienced, especially with the defensive armament. It began State trials on 23 August 1948 which lasted until 30 November 1948.

Opened in August 1974, the mall features anchor stores JCPenney, Macy's, and Target, with one vacant anchor space last occupied by Sears. It is owned and managed by Washington Prime Group. Westminster Mall is situated on the corner of Goldenwest Street and Bolsa Avenue in Westminster, California. History In the 1920s, the world's largest goldfish farm was relocated to the area where the mall stands today. Construction of the mall began in the 1970s.http://www.westminster- ca.gov/about/history.asp Westminster Mall opened for business at 9:30 AM on August 7, 1974, with May Company, Sears and Buffum's, with J. W. Robinson's being added in 1975 as the mall's fourth anchor store. Three of the mall's anchors changed names in the 1990s. Buffum's closed in May 1991 due to the chain being liquidated. By January 1993, Robinson's and May Company merged to form Robinsons-May. As a result, the May Company store was rebranded Robinsons-May, and the J. W. Robinson's was closed as one of the 12 Robinson's and May Company stores closing as part of the merger. The closed Buffum's store became a Robinson's-May Home Store in March 1993 and in November of that same year, the closed Robinson's store became a JCPenney, which had relocated from Huntington Center Mall (now Bella Terra). In 2002, the Robinsons-May Home Store building was torn down for a new Macy's. When Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.) purchased Robinsons-May and other May Co. names in September 2006, Macy's moved to the Robinsons-May building, and the former Macy's location soon became a Target. Old Navy was added as well. In 2008, the mall underwent a renovation, relocating the carousel and constructing a play area in its place. The Grand Re-opening was on November 15, 2008.

Mignon Nevada (14 August 1886 ‚Äì 25 June 1971) was an English operatic soprano. She was born in Paris, daughter of the American operatic soprano Emma Nevada and her English husband Raymond Palmer. She was named after the title character of the 1866 opera Mignon, written by her godfather, French composer Ambroise Thomas. Her voice was light and agile, and her mother trained her to be a coloratura soprano, although Sir Thomas Beecham thought this was a mistake, that she should have been a mezzo-soprano instead.Steane, J.

The New York Times reported that her mother's friends, Adelina Patti and Mary Garden travelled all the way to Rome just to attend Mignon's debut. Her performances were so well received that she was engaged to sing eight more times beyond her original four performances. Her success led her mother to request an audience for Mignon with Pope Pius X. (Her mother had had an audience with Leo XIII ten years prior.) Mignon made other early appearances in Italy and PortugalHughes, Edwin (August 1909). \\"American Singers in European Opera-Houses\\" World Today 17: 832. and then made her way to England where she appeared as Ophelia in Thomas' Hamlet under Thomas Beecham at the opening of the 1910 winter season at Covent Garden. In 1917 she appeared as Desdemona in Verdi's Otello with Frank Mullings in the title role and Frederic Austin as Iago. Beecham described her portrayal of Desdemona as \\"the best I have seen on any stage.\\" Her other roles in London included Olympia in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann, Zerlina in Mozart's Don Giovanni, and Marguerite in Gounod's Faust.

While a young medical student, she worked with her mother and grandmother to rescue more than 100 Jewish refugees as part of the Dutch resistance during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Strobos provided her house as a hiding place for Jews on the run, using a secret attic compartment and warning bell system to keep them safe from sudden police raids. In addition, Strobos smuggled guns and radios for the resistance and forged passports to help refugees escape the country. Despite being arrested and interrogated nine times by the Gestapo, she never betrayed the whereabouts of a Jew. After the war, Strobos completed her medical degree and became a psychiatrist. She studied under Anna Freud in England. Strobos later emigrated to the United States to study psychiatry under a Fulbright scholarship, and she subsequently settled in New York. She married twice and had three children. Strobos built a career as a family psychiatrist, receiving the Elizabeth Blackwell Medal in 1998 for her medical work, and finally retired from active practice in 2009. In 1989, Strobos was honored as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem for her rescue work. In 2009, she was recognized for her efforts by the Holocaust and Human Rights Education Center of New York City.  Early life  Tina Strobos was born Tineke Buchter on May 19, 1920, in Amsterdam. Her parents, Marie Schotte and Alphonse Buchter, were socialist atheists and fluent in four languages. Schotte supported the women's peace movement. Strobos' maternal grandfather had founded a freethinking movement, and her maternal grandmother had been part of the labor movement in the late nineteenth century. The family had a history of offering shelter to those in need: Strobos' parents had previously taken in refugees from earlier conflicts, while Strobos' grandmother had sheltered Belgian refugees during World War I. When Strobos was ten years old, her parents divorced. She lived with her mother. By the age of sixteen, Strobos had decided she wanted to become a psychiatrist. At university, she began studying medicine, but her studies were interrupted after Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940.  World War II resistance work  When the Germans invaded the Netherlands in May 1940, Strobos was living with her mother and their maid in Amsterdam. She was just about to turn twenty. University students were ordered to sign an oath of loyalty to Hitler, but Strobos and her classmates refused to sign. The medical school was subsequently shut down, and Strobos and many other students joined the underground movement.  Safe house and secret compartment  Strobos began her rescue work by hiding her best friend, a Jewish girl named Tirtsah Van Amerongen. Family friend Henry Polack‚Äîa socialist writer and labor leader‚Äîalso decided to go into hiding, and Strobos' grandmother agreed to help him. The Amsterdam street alt= Working with her mother and grandmother over the course of the war, Strobos rescued over 100 Jewish refugees by hiding them‚Äîfour or five at a time‚Äîat the family's boarding house at 282 Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal. The house had once been a city school, and had three floors. Once Strobos and her mother started hiding refugees, a carpenter from the Dutch underground arrived at their house and constructed a small hiding place in the attic. The secret compartment was located inside a gable. Although the Gestapo raided the house eight times, they never found this secret compartment. Strobos and her mother had a warning bell system installed in the house, which they used to warn refugees on the upper floors of unexpected Gestapo visits. If the Jews had no time to hide in the secret compartment, they could escape through the window to an adjoining building. The family was also assisted by an anonymous ally at the Gestapo headquarters, who sometimes phoned them to warn of an impending Nazi raid. They never learned the identity of this ally. Although some Jews stayed at their house for longer periods of time, Strobos and her mother mostly used their house as a temporary safe space, sheltering Jews for a short time until they could be moved to a safer refuge. Some refugees were subsequently smuggled to Spain or Switzerland, or to the Dutch countryside. Strobos and her mother often visited the people that they had arranged hiding places for, cycling miles out into the countryside to provide isolated refugees with valuable news and conversation. Among the refugees Strobos helped was impressionist painter Martin Monnickendam, who painted her portrait and gave it to her as a gift. She kept the painting well into her old age. The Strobos residence was only a ten-minute walk away from Anne Frank's hiding place at 263 Prinsengracht, Amsterdam. Although Strobos never met the Frank family, she later expressed her vexation at the fact that the Franks had not had an escape route built into their refuge: \\"If I knew they were there, I would have gotten them out of the country.\\"  Gestapo interrogations  During the course of the war, Strobos was arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo nine times. During these encounters, Strobos was seized by her wrists and thrown against a wall, and she was once knocked unconscious. She never once betrayed the whereabouts of a Jew. In order to pass interrogations safely, Strobos learned certain tactics. She always asked for an interpreter‚Äîdespite being fluent in German‚Äîin order to buy extra time to compose herself. When a Nazi officer once commented on her legs, Strobos gained more courage: \\"I realized that he was just a man and he was interested in my legs. So that gave me a sense of power. I got cocky. I could say 'I didn't know he was a Jew' in a stronger, more convincing way.\\"  Abraham Pais  Tina Strobos (left), her fianc√© Abraham Pais, and her mother Marie Schotte, c. 1941 During the early years of the war, Strobos was engaged to Abraham \\"Bram\\" Pais, a young Jewish particle physicist. She and her mother found hiding places for Pais and many of his relatives. Although they ended their engagement in 1943, Strobos and Pais remained friends. In February 1945, Pais was hiding in an apartment with three Jewish friends: Tirtsah Van Amerongen, her sister Jeanne, and Jeanne's husband Lion Nordheim. They were betrayed by one of Pais' ex-girlfriends, and all were arrested. When Strobos heard the news, she found the Gestapo official in charge and persuaded him to let Tirtsah and Jeanne go free, but she was unable to do the same for Lion. Rescuing Pais required a more complicated plan. Strobos had in her possession a letter from well known physicist Niels Bohr, who had previously invited Pais to come study with him in Denmark. Strobos took this letter directly to a high-ranking German official and asked him to free Pais, describing him as \\"a young genius in physics\\" who would go on to do great things. After making some phone calls, the official ordered Pais to be released. Pais later became a noted nuclear physicist and biographer, recording the life stories of Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein.  Other resistance activities  Strobos and her mother also hid key members of the Dutch underground movement, including resistance leader Johan Brouwer. Brouwer's resistance group Binnenlandse Strydkrachten did militant work such as smuggling weapons and building bombs. At the beginning of her work for the Dutch resistance, Strobos smuggled weapons, radios and explosives, traveling up to fifty miles with the contraband hidden in her bicycle basket. She brought news and ration stamps to Jews hiding on farms outside the city, as well as radios and firearms for the Dutch resistance. Sometimes Strobos hid large boxes of guns in her house. As the resistance movement became increasingly violent, however, Strobos shifted her focus towards helping Jews escape. She worked with the less militant Landelyke Organizatie (Country Organization) to shelter refugees and forge passports. left In order to forge paperwork to help Jews flee the country, Strobos stole identity cards from non-Jewish people at social gatherings, and replaced the photos and fingerprints with those of her Jewish refugees. She sometimes resorted to other measures to get the papers she needed: Strobos asked pickpockets to steal identity cards from travelers at train stations, and in 1941 she stole passports from the coat pockets of guests at her aunt's funeral. Strobos' maternal grandmother, Marie Schotte Abrahams, had a radio transmitter hidden in her house, which was used to send encoded messages from the Dutch underground to the BBC in Britain. She kept this radio despite the fact that the Germans had declared a death penalty for any Dutch citizen guilty of hiding radio equipment. On one occasion, when a Nazi visited Abrahams' house and tried to interrogate her, she grasped his arm, looked him in the eye, and asked \\"Did I not see you looting a Persian rug out of the Mendlessohns' apartment next door a few nights ago?\\" The Nazi officer collected his things and left quickly. Strobos later said of her grandmother: \\"She is the only person I know who scared the Gestapo.\\" Despite the closure of universities, Strobos continued to study medicine during the war. She sometimes offered her house as a meeting place for underground medical classes, hosting up to eighteen students every week. The local hospital provided opportunities for small groups of students to study pathology. She was taking her pharmacology exam at her professor's house in May 1945, and was interrupted when the Canadian Army arrived to officially liberate the Netherlands and everyone raced outside to watch the tanks and soldiers come through the city gates.  Post-war career and honors  After the war ended, Strobos obtained her medical degree from the University of Amsterdam in 1946, and went on to study psychiatry in London, England with Anna Freud. During the 1950s, Strobos went to Valhalla, New York, to undertake a residency in psychiatry and neurology at Westchester Medical Center. She studied child psychiatry with the support of a Fulbright scholarship. Strobos built a career as a family psychiatrist, with a special focus on working with the mentally impaired. She received the Elizabeth Blackwell Medal for her work as a medical professional in 1998, and finally retired from active practice in 2009. In 1989, Strobos and her mother, Marie Schotte, were officially recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. In 2009, Strobos was honored for her rescue work by the Holocaust and Human Rights Education Center of New York City. When asked in interviews about why she had risked her life to save others, Strobos said, \\"It's the right thing to do... Your conscience tells you to do it. I believe in heroism, and when you're young, you want to do dangerous things.\\"  Family and personal life  Strobos' first husband was Robert Strobos, a neurologist. They traveled to the West Indies in 1947, where Tina worked as a practicing psychiatrist for two years. After divorcing Robert in 1964, Tina Strobos later married economist Walter Chudson in 1967. Chudson was an American Jew who worked for the United Nations. Strobos and Chudson settled down in Larchmont, New York, and they stayed together until his death in 2002. Strobos had two sons and one daughter from her first marriage, and two stepchildren from her second marriage. Her two sons became a physician and a paramedic, while her daughter became a psychoanalyst. At the time of her death, Strobos had seven grandchildren and two step-grandchildren.  Death  Strobos died of cancer, aged 91, on February 27, 2012, in Rye, New York.  References   External links  * Visiting Tina Strobos' Amsterdam House‚Äîvideo clip.

The western terminus of SR 347 is at SR 287 near Middleburg, adjacent to the U.S. Route 33 freeway. Its eastern terminus is at a T-intersection with SR 37 just south of the village of Magnetic Springs. The route runs through rural areas of Logan and Union counties passing through no incorporated villages. Route description SR 347 begins at a T-intersection with SR 287 in Zane Township, Logan County just northeast of the unincorporated community of Middleburg. SR 287 heads southwest and southeast from this point, while SR 347 heads northwest. The road at this point is parallel to US 33 which is routed along a freeway, SR 347 through this area is itself an old alignment of US 33. After and in Perry Township, SR 347 curves around the ramps of an interchange and comes to an intersection with Logan County Route 144. SR 347 turns right at this intersection and reaches the ends of the aforementioned interchange wit US 33. After crossing over US 33, the route passes near the community of East Liberty, the Transportation Research Center facility, and Honda's East Liberty Auto Plant. Past the plant, SR 347 crosses into Liberty Township, Union County travels in a more easterly direction. In the unincorporated community of Raymond, SR 347 shares a brief concurrency with SR 739. The route also passes through the center of Broadway, a small unincorporated community in Taylor Township. For the remainder of the route, SR 347 passes through mostly farmland with intersections with SR 31 in Taylor Township and SR 4 in Leesburg Township. The route ends at a T-intersection with SR 37 just south of Magnetic Springs. SR 37 continues east towards the city of Delaware. The terrain of SR 347 is mainly flat though near US 33, the route skirts the Union Moraine, location of the highest point in the state. No segment of SR 347 is inclusive within the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways deemed most important for the country's economy, mobility and defense. History The designation of SR 347 took place in 1935. At the time, the highway was a short connector routed along its present alignment between its junction with SR 4 in the hamlet of Pharisburg and its eastern terminus at SR 37 near Magnetic Springs. In 1937, SR 347 was extended west along most of its current alignment to East Liberty at what would later become US 33, but at the time was known as SR 32\\\\. This extension followed a previously un-numbered road. In East Liberty, SR 347 and SR 292 formed a concurrency to both end at US 33 west of the town. Between 1992 and 1994, SR 347 was moved onto a new road south of East Liberty to better serve the auto plant which opened in 1989. The old route to East Liberty became Logan CR 10 and Union CR 347. The intersection with US 33 became an interchange when US 33 was converted to a freeway in the late 1990s. During the winter of 2013‚Äì2014, SR 347 was extended about over Logan County Routes 144A and 144 to SR 287 as a part of a maintenance swap with Logan County. As a part of the swap, the Ohio Department of Transportation gave up jurisdiction of SR 533 to the county.

This lock is immediately west of Brimscombe Port, on the Thames and Severn Canal, which was the eastern end of Phase 1a of the restoration project. The Cotswold Canals Trust (previously the Stroudwater and Thames and Severn Canal Trust) is an English registered charity that aims to protect and restore the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal. The group was founded in 1972, and was initially called the Stroudwater Canal Society. The society became the Stroudwater, Thames and Severn Canal Trust in 1975 as the scope of the project increased, and subsequently became the Cotswold Canals Trust in July 1990. History The development of the Trust began in 1972, when Michael Ayland investigated canals near to his home at Saul Junction, and discovered that the Stroudwater Navigation was in the process of being filled in. He mentioned his concern, that this was happening while other canals were being opened, to Allan Guy, then working for the Bristol Evening Post and the paper carried an article announcing that the canal was to be re- opened to Stroud. Although Ayland had not said so, people responded to the article and he was inundated with phone calls from people offering to help. Shortly afterwards, the newspaper carried a statement from the Company of Proprietors of the Stroudwater Navigation, to the effect that they owned the canal and had no intentions to reopen it. However, Ayland now had a small group of enthusiasts around him and they decided to hold a public meeting to judge the level of support. Having originally booked a small room for the meeting, on the assumption that about 20 people might attend, they realised that the numbers might exceed one hundred, and booked a larger room. In the event, over three hundred people attended the meeting, held in May 1972, at which John Humphries from the Inland Waterways Association spoke of other restoration projects then being undertaken and the outcome was the formation of the Stroudwater Canal Society. Membership of the fledgeling society increased quite quickly, but it soon became obvious that many of those joining wanted to see the complete restoration of the canal and the Thames and Severn Canal, to provide a link to the River Thames. When a more formal structure was required, the society reformed as the Stroudwater, Thames and Severn Canal Trust. The title was later changed to the rather shorter Cotswold Canals Trust. In 2020 a major grant, including ¬£8.9 million from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, was awarded to enable work to open 4.5 miles of canal and link Stroud to Saul junction and the rest of the canal network. Aims and activities The current aim is to restore the canals between Saul Junction, where the Stroudwater Canal joins the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal and Lechlade, where the Thames and Severn Canal joins the River Thames. Among other activities over 1,000 hours has been put into clearing the canal between Lechlade and Sapperton. The trust ran monthly trips into the Sapperton Tunnel until these were halted for conservancy reasons. An agreement allowing them to restart was reached in 2006 between the trust and English Nature. The trust has a partnership with the Rural Skills Centre at the Royal Agricultural University. This has allowed volunteers to learn how to operate diggers, chainsaws and brush cutters. The Trow The Trust have published a quarterly magazine entitled The Trow since February 1973, to update members with details of progress and activities. The magazine takes its name from the Severn trow, a flat-bottomed, wooden cargo boat with a collapsible sailing mast, used on the River Severn.

Opened in 1977, the mall featured one anchor store (JCPenney). Former anchors were Dillard's, Montgomery Ward, Mervyn's, Sears, and Macy's. The mall also included a food court and formerly included a movie theater. It was also a dead mall, having closed in 2011. History Westminster Mall opened in 1977 with Joslin's and thirty other stores. In 1980, they added the hallway that connected to the soon-to-be May D&F; store, thus increasing the stores to 75. A 1986 expansion added May D&F;, Mervyn's, and Broadway Southwest, and 112 more stores and a modern food court, followed by JCPenney in 1987 and Wards in 1996. The expansions brought the mall to of gross leasable area (GLA), making it one of the largest in the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the only one with six department stores. May D&F; was converted to Foley's in 1993. Two years after a 1996 remodel of the store, Joslin's was converted to Dillard's, which also acquired land around the mall. Broadway Southwest was the last store in its chain to close, doing so in 1996 and soon being replaced by Sears, which relocated from Northglenn Mall. In September 2006, Foley's was re-branded as Macy's. Between 1997 and 2009, the mall would lose three of its six department stores as well as major tenant Fashion Bar, which closed in 1997. Wards closed in 2001 with the demise of the chain, followed by Mervyn's closing in 2005. Mervyn's departed from the Colorado market in 2006. Macy's closed in early 2009. With the loss of these anchor stores, the mall has also become increasingly vacant, and is only half occupied as of 2009. In June 2009, the mall's owners purchased the vacant Mervyn's as part of a redevelopment plan. As of May 2011, the City of Westminster is reported to have purchased the mall for redevelopment. Plans called for the 34-year-old mall to be demolished by the end of the year with hopes that the anchor stores would remain open. On May 13, 2011, Dillard's reported that it would close its location at the mall during its second quarter of business in 2011. Demolition of the mall began on June 23, 2011, starting off with the demolition of Macy's. On January 20, 2012, it was announced that Sears would also be closing in June 2012 as part of a plan to close 81 stores nationwide which left JCPenney as the only remaining anchor. On January 24, 2012, it was further confirmed that the City of Westminster would purchase the 7.9 acre parcel from Sears Holding Corp. for $4.2 million. By the spring of 2012, three anchors, Macy's, Mervyn's, and Montgomery Ward, two restaurants, Trail Dust Steakhouse and Steak & Ale, the cinema and remaining mall corridor had been demolished. The demolition of Dillard's began that spring. The demolition of Sears started in August 2012. Plans for the former Westminster Mall location were revealed August 27, 2013. Westminster's plans for a new downtown on the site of the former Westminster Mall took another step forward during an August 26 presentation outlining a development that includes multi-story office and residential buildings, unique public spaces and vibrant shopping areas. The master plan will provide a framework and vision for the new downtown as development occurs over the next 20‚Äì30 years.

From July 1937 to December 1940 he served as an instructor and flight commander at Randolph Field, Texas and then went to Pursuit School at Craig Field, Alabama. Going to England as a military observer with the Fighter Command of the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain, Edwinson returned to the United States in March 1942, to become group operations officer at Dale Mabry Field, Florida. In December of that year he enrolled as a student at the Command and General Staff School, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and graduated the following February. World War II Immediately thereafter, Edwinson assumed command of a fighter wing at Drew Army Air Field, Florida, and in May 1943, went to Alaska as executive officer of the Eleventh Air Force. That October he was appointed wing executive officer to the San Francisco Fighter Wing in California, and in April 1944 assumed command of the 412th Base Unit at Seattle, Washington, moving the unit to Portland, Oregon. A P-38 like the one flown by Curly Edwinson during World War II flying over California. Moving to Italy in August 1944, General Edwinson was designated commander of the 82nd Fighter Group. According to one source, Edwinson led the first all-fighter shuttle mission to Russia.This claim is made in \\"Grottaglie, and Home: A History of the 449th Bombardment Squadron\\", p. 257. The book also claims that Edwinson was responsible for pioneering high altitude precision bombing. Air Force records, however, show this first shuttle mission did not occur until July 22, 1944.See timeline of key events in Air Force history at Edwinson was in command during a controversial incident in November 1944 when American pilots shot down four Soviet Yaks. The incident is described in Combat Aircraft of World War II by Glenn B. Bavousett: Lee K. Carr in \\"Air Classics\\" (Volume 38, Number 8) has a different take on the incident blaming Edwinson for poor planning and communication though this seems to be a minority opinion. Indeed, the fact that Edwinson eventually became a brigadier general and was appointed to command on three subsequent occasions seems to underscore how much Carr's opinion seems to be in the minority. The following January he went to Bluethenthal Army Air Field, North Carolina, as deputy base commanding officer, and on March 13, 1945, assumed command of the base. On October 21, 1945 he became deputy base commanding officer of Shaw AAF, South Carolina. By the end of the war he had flown 30 combat missions and 13,000 hours. Post- war service The following May, Edwinson assumed command of the 366th Fighter Group at Fritzlar Air Base, Germany, and that November was named commander of Lechfeld Air Base. In February 1947, he returned to Fritzlar AB as commanding officer of the 27th Fighter Group, and on July 21 of that year assumed command of the 86th Composite Group (1948: 86th Fighter Group) at Bad Kissengen Air Base, Germany. At that time the 86th was the only combat-capable fighter group of the USAF in Europe. General Curtis LeMay regarded Edwinson as his best combat commander during this period. LeMay planned to use Edwinson's P-47's if he needed to take offensive actions to keep Berlin supplied.Barrett Tillman, \\"LeMay: Lessons in Leadership,\\" pps 85‚Äì86. On July 1, 1948, the group became part of the newly activated 86th Fighter Wing, and Edwinson moved up to command the wing. Returning to the United States in June 1949, Edwinson became base and wing commanding officer of the 3902nd Air Base Wing, Strategic Air Command, at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. On April 6, 1951, he assumed command of the 42d Air Division, SAC, at Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas. The general became special assistant to the commander, Second Air Force, SAC, at Bergstrom AFB, on June 30, 1957. He was promoted to brigadier general on December 15, 1953. Joining the Air Defense Command, on August 15, 1957 Edwinson was assigned duty as commander of the 30th Air Division (Defense), Eastern Air Defense Force, with station at Willow Run Air Force Station, Michigan, with additional duty on August 17 as commander, 30th Continental Air Defense Division. On June 10, 1958, he was relieved from additional duty as commander, 30th CONAD Division and assigned additional duty as commander, 30th NORAD (CONAD) Division, Belleville, Mich.

Coloration If A. xanthogrammica is exposed to proper amounts of sunlight, it can appear bright green when submerged under water. When not submerged, it appears dark green or brown. This is because the anemone tends to close up and \\"droop\\" and its now exposed column is actually dark green and slightly brown, but the hidden tentacles and oral disk are bright green. Tentacles The tentacles, which are short and conical, are arranged in six or more rows surrounding the oral diskEncyclopedia of Life. (2010). Anthopleura xanthogrammica (on-line), EOL.org. Accessed May 10, 2010 at http://www.eol.org/pages/704306 and can be pointed or blunt at the tips. Distribution Generally, A. xanthogrammica is found along the low to mid intertidal zones of the Pacific Ocean, from Alaska to southern California and sometimes downwards to Panama, where cold water swells can occur.Gotshall, D. (2005). Guide to Marine Invertebrates. Shoreline Press, Santa Barbara:30. Habitat A. xanthogrammica prefers to inhabit sandy or rocky shorelines, where water remains for most of the day. They can generally be found in tide pools up to 15 m deep. Occasionally A. xanthogrammica can also be found in deep channels of more exposed rocky shores and concrete pilings in bays and harbors. Biology and natural history Photosynthetic algae, zoochlorellae, and the dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae, live in the epidermis and tissue of the gut of A. xanthogrammica. In this symbiotic relationship, the zoochlorellae and zooxanthellae provide nutrients to the anemone via photosynthesis and contribute to the bright green color of the anemone's oral disk and tentacles. The bright green color is also due to pigmentation. Anthopleura xanthogrammica anemones living in caves and shady zones have reduced or no natural symbionts and tend to be less colorful. Behavior These anemones tend to live a solitary life, but can be occasionally seen as groups with no more than 14 individuals per square meter. They can move slowly using their basal disks, but usually stay sessile. Like other anemones, A. xanthogrammica can use stinging cells located in the tentacles as protection from predators and a mechanism to capture prey. Reproduction Anthopleura xanthogrammica reproduce sexually via external fertilization of sperm and eggs in the late fall. Newly formed pelagic, planktotrophic larvae float in the water until dispersing and settling in mussel beds. Feeding Nematocysts found in the tentacles assist A. xanthogrammica to catch and paralyze prey. After feeding and digestion is complete, the anemone excretes its waste back through the mouth opening. Predators and prey Main predators of A. xanthogrammica include: the leather seastar Dermasterias imbricata, the nudibranch Aeolidia papillosa and the snail Epitonium tinctum (both feed on the tentacles), and the snails Opalia chacei and Opalia funiculata and the sea spider Pycnogonum stearnsi (that feed on the column). The anemone feeds on sea urchins, small fish, and crabs, but detached mussels seem to be the main food source.

The sounds result from vibrations created by closure of the heart valves, there are at least two: the first when the atrioventricular valves (tricuspid and mitral) close at the beginning of systole and the second when the aortic valve and pulmonary valve (semilunar valves) close at the end of systole. It allows the detection of subaudible sounds and murmurs, and makes a permanent record of these events. In contrast, the stethoscope cannot always detect all such sounds or murmurs, and it provides no record of their occurrence. The ability to quantitate the sounds made by the heart provides information not readily available from more sophisticated tests, and it provides vital information about the effects of certain drugs on the heart. It is also an effective method for tracking the progress of the person's disease. Discrete and the packet wavelet transform According to a review by Cherif et al, discrete wavelet transform DWT is better at not affecting S1 or S2 while filtering heart murmurs. Packet wavelet transform affects internal components structure much more than DWT does. History Awareness of the sounds made by the heart dates to ancient times. The idea of developing an instrument to record it may date back to Robert Hooke (1635‚Äì1703), who wrote: \\"There may also be a possibility of discovering the internal motions and actions of bodies - whether animal, vegetable, or mineral, by the sound they make\\". The earliest known examples of phonocardiography date to the 1800s. William Birnbaum with a Phonocardiogram System for use in Project Gemini, 1965 Monitoring and recording equipment for phonocardiography was developed through the 1930s and 1940s. Standardization began by 1950, when the first international conference was held in Paris. A phonocardiogram system manufactured by Beckman Instruments was used on at least one of the Project Gemini manned spaceflights (1965-1966) to monitor the heartbeat of astronauts on the flight. It was one of many Beckman Instruments specialized for and used by NASA. John Keefer filed a patent for a phonocardiogram simulator in 1970 while he was an employee of the U.S. government. The original patent description indicates that it is a device which via electrical voltage mimics the human heart's sounds.

The sculpture stands on a square base which has bronze relief panels depicting the story of Perseus and Andromeda, similar to a predella on an altarpiece.Shearman, ‚ÄúArt or Politics,‚Äù. It is located in the Loggia dei Lanzi in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, Italy. The second Florentine duke, Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, commissioned the work with specific political connections to the other sculptural works in the piazza. When the piece was revealed to the public on 27 April 1554, Michelangelo's David, Bandinelli's Hercules and Cacus, and Donatello's Judith and Holofernes were already installed in the piazza.Shearman, p. 28. The subject matter of the work is the mythological story of Perseus beheading Medusa, a hideous woman-faced Gorgon whose hair had been turned to snakes; anyone who looked at her was turned to stone. Perseus stands naked except for a sash and winged sandals, triumphant on top of the body of Medusa with her head, crowned with writhing snakes, in his raised hand. Blood spews from Medusa's severed neck. The bronze sculpture, in which Medusa's head turns men to stone, is appropriately surrounded by three huge marble statues of men: Hercules, David, and later Neptune. Cellini's use of bronze in Perseus and the head of Medusa, and the motifs he used to respond to the previous sculpture in the piazza, were highly innovative. Examining the sculpture from the back, one can see a self-portrait of the sculptor Cellini on the back of Perseus' helmet. The sculpture is thought to be the first statue since the classical age where the base included a figurative sculpture forming an integral part of the work.  Background  Cellini was the first to integrate narrative relief into the sculpture of the piazza.Weil-Garris, On Pedestals, p. 411. As the Perseus was installed in the Loggia, it dominated the dimensions of later pedestals of other sculptural works within the Loggia, like Giambologna's The Rape of the Sabine Women.Weil- Garris, p. 413. Perseus added to the cast of Olympian gods protecting the Medici.Weil-Garris, p. 409. Weil-Garris also focuses on the pedestal beneath the sculpture in the round. However, the present pedestal may not have been Cellini's original intent, as the relief was still being worked on and installed when the bronze sculpture above had already been revealed.Weil- Garris, p. 411. The Medici still dominated the theme of the pedestal as Perseus in the pedestal is an allegory for Duke Francesco Medici.Mandel, Perseus and the Medici, 175. The base of the sculpture, Perseus' feet on the slain Medusa's headless corpse The politics of the Medici and Florence dominate the Piazza della Signoria, specifically making reference to the first three Florentine dukes. Duke Alessandro I was the first Florentine duke and Hercules and Cacus was revealed during his time, meeting with a terrible reception by the public in 1534.Mandel, p. 168. The next sculpture to be revealed was Cellini's Perseus and Cosimo I was very cautious about the public's reaction to the piece. Fortunately, the public received the sculpture well, as Cosimo watched the reception from a window in the Palazzo Vecchio. The third duke is directly related to the sculpture's relief panel on the base as the Perseus can be seen as a symbol for Duke Francesco and Andromeda as his Habsburg bride, Giovanna.Mandel, Perseus and the Medici, p. 175. Similarly, Andromeda acts as an allegory for Florence, while Perseus is the collective Medici swooping down to save the city.Mandel, p. 175. Cellini chose to represent the sad side of the story of Andromeda; however he created a focus on the Medici, as Perseus, saving the unsmiling Andromeda.Burne-Jones, Andromeda, 211. Every sculpture in the piazza can be seen as politically or artistically related to one another and to the Medici.  The work  At the time the sculpture was created, bronze had not been used in almost half a century for a monumental work of art. Cellini made the conscious decision to work in this medium because by pouring molten metal into his cast, he was vivifying the sculpture with life-giving blood.Cole, Cellini‚Äôs Blood, 221. The most difficult part would be completing the entire cast all at once. Donatello's Judith and Holofernes was already placed in the Loggia dei Lanzi in the westernmost arch.Cole, p. 217. Judith had been cast in bronze, but in several sections jointed together.Cole, 220. Cellini was competing against monumental works of marble sculpture like Michelangelo's David and wanted to make a statement for himself and his patron, Cosimo I. Michael Cole specifically draws attention to the process of casting the Perseus. Citing Cellini's Vita, Cole notes how Cellini's assistants let the metal clot and had Cellini not been present the work would have been destroyed.Cole, p. 221. Cole then asserts that Cellini goes beyond reviving the work, but raised the dead, in which he means that Cellini's salvation was remelting the bronze.Cole, p. 221 Cellini also invokes Christ and by doing so he breathes life into the sculpture.Cole, p. 222. Casting the Perseus was more than meeting the demand of Cosimo I; Cellini was proving himself to Florence in a newly refurbished medium. Perseus was one of Cellini's crowning works, completed with two different ideals in mind. He wanted to respond to the sculpture already placed within the piazza, which he did with the subject matter of Medusa reducing men to stone. Secondly, the Medici were represented by Perseus, both in the round sculpture and the relief below. Moreover, in that respect, Cellini also made a statement for himself in the actual casting of Perseus. Cellini breathed life into his new sculpture through his use of bronze and he asserted Medici control over the Florentine people through the Perseus motif. There is an exquisite, though smaller scale, bronze copy of the Perseus displayed outside The Ringling Museum in Sarasota, Florida, USA.

She was involved in two notable actions while in British service before she was sold in 1825. Danish origins Brevdrageren was built at Nyholm Dockyard to a design by F.C.H. Hohlenberg and launched in 1801. She was the name-ship of a two-vessel class, and both she and her sister Fama had distinctive pinched or \\"pink\\" sterns, that is, sterns that were rounded rather than the more normal square stern. Another vessel, Fehmern, was built similarly to Brevdrageren and her sister, but was slightly heavier. These vessels were much smaller than the heavy brigs designed for combat and the Danes used them as despatch vessels; Brevdrageren in Danish means \\"Despatch\\" or \\"Letter Carrier\\". Her official Danish armament was eight 4-pounder guns and four 12-pounder carronades. Alternatively, she may have carried two 6-pounder guns, and sixteen 12-pounder carronades, since accounts differ. British service The Royal Navy surveyed Brev Drageren and refitted her at Chatham. She was commissioned under Lieutenant J. S. A. Dennis. In 1809 the Navy considered renaming her Cockatrice but that plan fell through.Winfield (2008), p.348. Command then passed to a Lieutenant Charles C. Dobson, who was later court martialed for an \\"unnatural crime\\" committed in September 1809 while in command.Hickman, William (1850). A Treatise on the Law and Practice of Naval Courtsmartial, London: Spottiswood B S and Shaw On 24 August 1809, , was in company with the schooner , the gun-vessel and two boats detached from Brev Drageren and . Together they captured property at Harlinger Zyl, together with a Danish privateer and a mutt in ballast. Escape from three Danish Brigs, 1811 Lieutenant Thomas Barker Devon, ex-First Lieutenant of , took command of Brev Drageren on 12 October 1809.O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 1, p.283. On 31 July 1811, Brev Drageren and were cruising together in Long Sound, Norway, when they encountered and engaged three Danish brigs, Lolland, under the command of Captain Hans Peter Holm, and Kiel and Lougen. The Danes had 54 guns and 480 men, against the British 22 guns and 107 men;The Naval Chronicle gives the Danish strength as 60 guns (all long 18-pounders), and 550 men. outnumbered and outgunned, the British vessels took flight.Naval Chronicle Vol. 26 (Jul-Dec 1811), pp.284-6. The next day Brev Drageren unsuccessfully re-engaged first one and then two of the brigs. In the inconclusive engagement each British vessel sustained one man killed, and Brev Drageren also had three wounded. In the second day‚Äôs fight, Algerine sent a boat and sweeps to Brev Drageren, which helped her escape the Danes, though not until after her crew had rowed for 30 hours.James (1837), Vol. 5, p.346. The Danes reported capturing two cargo ships (galleases) that Brev Drageren had been escorting.Wandell (1915), p.369. Capture of Prizes off the Ems, 1812 During 1812 Brev Drageren was stationed at Heligoland, which the British had captured in 1807. Here she made several minor captures. One capture was of a French privateer lugger and another was an armed customs- house vessel that Brev Drageren cut out from Delfzijl at the mouth of the river Ems.Marshall (1831), Vol. 3, Part 1, pp.227-35. The second of these may have been a Danish privateer of one long gun and four swivel guns that the boats of and Brev Drageren, under the command of Sub-Lieutenant George Anderson of Brev Drageren, cut out.Naval Chronicle Vol. 21 (Jan-Jun 1809), p.433. Between 18 and 25 March she captured Jeune Nicholas, Trois Freres, Vrow Johanna, Deux Freres, and the cargo Gerrit Peter Kripisz. Then on 17 April Brev Drageren was in company with when they captured the Noysonheid. Nightingale and Exertion captured the Deux Freres, Vrow, Anna Jacobs, and LeDeux Freres (2), on 3 June. On 9 March 1813, Brev Drageren was in company with when they captured the Danish sloop Enigheiden. Operations in the Elbe, 1813 On 14 March 1813 Lieutenant Francis Banks, of the gun-brig Blazer, who commanded the small British force stationed off the island of Heligoland, received information that the Russian Army had entered Hamburg and that the French at Cuxhaven were in some distress. He took Brev Drageren and proceeded to the river Elbe to intercept any fleeing French vessels. Early in the morning he found two abandoned gun-vessels that he destroyed. Then the British found that the French were destroying their flotilla of 20 large gun schuyts. The next day, by invitation from the shore, Banks landed with 32 troops that he had embarked at Heligoland and took possession of the batteries of Cuxhaven. On 17 March he agreed a treaty with the civil authorities that the British flag should be hoisted in conjunction with the colours of Hamburg. The Russians agreed that they would deliver all the military stores they captured to the two British vessels. Brev Drageren and Blazer shared in the prize money for the Ever Pascal, Deux Freres, Vrow Elizabeth, and stores at Cuxhaven and St. Cricq that they captured on 17 March. On 21 March 1813, Devon took eight men and his 12-year-old brother, Midshipman Frederick Devon, in Brev Dragerens gig. William Dunbar, Master of Blazer, took 11 men in Blazers cutter. Together the two boats went up river in search of a privateer reported to be in the area. Off the Danish port of Brunsbuttel they sighted two boats, one of which hailed them, ran up Danish colours and opened fire, fortunately over the heads of the British. Devon boarded the gunboat in the smoke of her second broadside, and possibly the explosion of some cartridges on her deck, and captured her. Blazers cutter came up and together the British sailors succeeded in imprisoning the Danish crew below deck. The gunboat turned out to be the Jonge-Troutman. She was under the command of Lieutenant Lutkin, had a crew of 25 men and carried two 18-pounders and three 12-pounders. Dunbar and the cutter then turned their attention to the second gunboat, the Liebe, and captured her too. She was under the command of Lieutenant Writt and had the same establishment as the Jonge-Troutman. The British suffered no casualties and the Danes suffered two wounded.Tancred (1891), 182-3. Admiral Young, the commander-in-chief of the British navy in the area, wrote to Devon, asking him to convey to his men the Admiralty's approbations of their conduct. He acknowledged that \\"gun-boats make but bad prizes\\" and therefore pledged that his share of any prize money should be distributed to the crews of the boats. Prize money was paid in June 1815. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"21 March Boat Service 1813\\" to all surviving claimants of the action. There were three claimants. Frederick Devon was one. The other two went to Thomas Davies, then Assistant Surgeon of Brev Drageren and James Whiteman, then a Private in the Royal Marines, stationed on Blazer. On 4 May Devon received a promotion to commander. Brev Drageren was re-rated as a sloop-of-war so that he could continue in command. Operations in the Ems, 1813 Then on 10 July 1813 Brev Drageren was part of a squadron that captured eight small vessels in the Elbe and Weser. The squadron included , , , , the hired armed cutter Princess Augusta, and gunboats. In August Brev Drageren was in company with when they captured the Danish droits Haabet and Evers, No. 73 and 123, on the 13th and 14th. In October 1813 Captain Arthur Farquhar, of the 18-pounder 36-gun frigate Desiree, arrived at Heligoland to assume command of the British naval forces there, including Brev Drageren. Brev Drageren, together with two gun-vessels, blockaded Delfzijl, which the French had fortified, by anchoring just outside the range of the French batteries. In this way she contained 17 armed vessels in the port. Devon also assisted in repelling numerous French sorties. Nevertheless, the French held out until the Allies occupied Paris in April 1814. During this period, Brev Drageren captured Enigheid on 27 October. Devon came into conflict with the Prussian authorities when he prevented them from seizing spars in the custody of a British government agent. This resulted in Brev Drageren being recalled to England in July, though no blame attached to Devon. Fate Being unfit for further service, Brev Drageren was hulked as a tender in 1815. On 6 January 1817 the Thames River police took her over for use as a depot. In July 1818 she became a prison ship and served in that capacity until 1820, when she became an Army depot ship. On 24 September 1825 the Navy listed her as available for sale. On 13 October 1825 Joshua Crystall bought Brev Drageren for breaking up.

Following his departure, he agreed with Costa Rican outfit Liga Deportiva Alajuelense however the movement is not completed due to licensing issues in which Trabzonspor received a caution from FIFA to sort out the issue. International career At the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup, he was named the best goalkeeper of the tournament. He made his national team d√©but in an August 2010 friendly match against Paraguay. On 12 March 2012, it was announced that Alvarado was barred from the national team for five months after leaving the team before a friendly match against Spain without communicating the staff. In March 2014, he ruled out a selection for the 2014 FIFA World Cup due to an apparent strife with national team manager Jorge Luis Pinto. But in May 2014, Alvarado was named in a provisional 26-man squad in the FIFA World Cup By the end of May, Alvarado was not named in the 23 men squad, presumed to be a continuous strife with national team manager Pinto. Following Pinto's departure as manager of Costa, Alvarado returned to the national football team, under new management of Paulo Wanchope. In the CONCACAF Gold Cup, Alvarado was included in the squad and replaced Keylor Navas as a first choice goalkeeper following his injury. Personal life In June 2011, Alvarado was accused by his girlfriend, Marcela Ju√°rez Castillo, of domestic violence. However, two months later, charges against Alvarado were later dropped. While growing up in Costa Rica, Alvarado made good friends with Joel Campbell, having played together in childhood. Alvarado also revealed that he played as striker before switching position to become goalkeeper at fourteen.

Her Lament for a Dead Son and Encomium of Prince Lazar are famous in the canon of medieval Serbian literature. The lament, a strictly feminine form of lyric, is common to South Slavic languages (called tu≈æbalice in Serbian), and long narrative laments are intimately connected with heroic epic songs (e.g. Yarsolavna's lament in The Tale of Igor's Campaign). Biography Her secular name was Jelena. She was a daughter of Kesar Vojihna of Drama, and the wife of Jovan Uglje≈°a Mrnjavƒçeviƒá, another medieval Serbian feudal lord. She is a tragic and majestic figure in Serbian history of the Mrnjavƒçeviƒá family. She was raised at the court of her father, who was one of the chief officers of the crown. Vojihna took part in the equitable jurisdiction of the exchequer, and was styled not merely as king's treasurer or treasurer of the exchequer, but as kesar (equivalent to lord high treasurer) and officer of the exchequer. (A holder of the post of kesar would be the third highest ranked great officer of the state, below Despot and Sevastokrator). Her father secured a proper education for Jelena. The tragic events in her life seem to have the source of inspiration for her literary compositions, which were engraved on the golden backs of icons or embroidered on shrouds and church curtains rather than written on parchment of paper. The premature death of her infant son Uglje≈°a, which came shortly after the death of her father Vojihna, signaled the beginning of the tragedies which were to befall her. The child was buried together with his grandfather at the Serbian Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos, in Greece, where women were prohibited to enter. The Serbian monastery was far from the city of Serres where Jelena resided at the court of Despot Jovan Uglje≈°a, her husband. Unable to visit the grave of her son, she engraved her lament on the back of a diptych, a two-panel icon, which the Bishop of Serres Teodosije had presented as a baptismal gift to the infant Uglje≈°a. The precious piece of art, already valuable because of the gold, precious stones, and beautiful wood carving, became priceless after Jelena's lament was engraved on its back. The beauty of that lament is in its simplicity and its restrained and dignified, yet quite evident, maternal sorrow. The young mother admits that she cannot help grieving. What was intended to be a prayer for the deceased child became the confession of a mother unable to conceal her inner pain for her newborn. Engraved on the icons depicting Mother and Son, Jelena's lament for Uglje≈°a immortalized the sorrow of all mothers mourning their deceased children. The Battle of Maritsa The year 1371 brought another tragedy to Jelena's life. Her husband Jovan Uglje≈°a, together with his brothers Vuka≈°in Mrnjavƒçeviƒá and Gojko Mrnjavƒçeviƒá, gathered their armies in order to try to stop the Ottoman threat rising in the Balkans. They met the Turks at Maritsa river; and in the ensuing Battle of Maritsa, two of the Mrnjavƒçeviƒá brothers, as well as the major part of their armies, were killed. Unfortunately, a contemporary historical account of the battle is missing. According to legend, Vuka≈°in was surprised by the greatly outnumbered Turks and decided to camp for the night before battle. The Osmanlis waited and attacked the Serbian camps in a night raid and managed to achieve victory against all odds. The Turkish invasion of Ra≈°ka and other Serbian feudal provinces was postponed, but at a high cost - the deaths of Jovan Uglje≈°a and his brother. Jelena's personal tragedy was augmented by national tragedy. At twenty-two, she was already a widow‚Äîhelpless and unconsolable. She had to leave the court in Serres and move to the city of Kru≈°evac, the capital of Ra≈°ka at that time, where she accepted hospitality of the court of Prince Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá and his wife Milica Hrebeljanoviƒá. Shortly before moving to Kru≈°evac, Jelena became a nun and took the name of Jefimija. While at the court of Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá, Jefemija, who seems to have been skilled in the art of embroidery, embroidered a curtain which she sent to the monastery of Hilandar as her gift. The text embroidered on the curtain is not Jefimija's original composition, but a combination of passages from the prayers of Symeon the New Theologian on Holy Communion, Symeon the Metaphrast, and Saint John Chrysostom. It is a large, beautifully embroidered, and ornamented curtain which is still treasured at the Hilandar Monastery at Mount Athos. The Battle of Kosovo The tragic Battle of Maritsa in 1371 was but a prelude to the fateful confrontation between the invading Turkish forces, led by Sultan Murad I, and the Serbian warriors, led by Prince Lazar, which took place in 1389 on the field of Kosovo. The Battle of Kosovo can best be described as a draw, as the two leaders were killed and their armies decimated, or as a defeat for the Serbs, who were unable to recover from it for years to come. For the Serbs, the Battle of Kosovo marked the beginning of almost five centuries of Ottoman and Habsburg occupation of Serbian lands. Jefemija's host and protector, Prince Lazar, was beheaded at the order of Murad's son Bayezid I. Once more, Jefimija's sorrow was augmented by national tragedy through the loss of her beloved and respected friend. She expressed her grief through art: she embroidered a shroud for Lazar's coffin. On that shroud, she embroidered a poetic text of original creation in which she addressed the saint-martyr directly rather than God, as was customary. This shroud was completed in 1402. In 1405, shortly before her death, Jefimija embroidered an epitaphion. In the text, the Mother laments her Son, indicating the possibility that Jefimija was actually thinking again of her own deceased son while working on this embroidery, her last: :In the beauties of this world you grew from your youth, oh new martyr, Prince Lazar, and the strong hand of the Lord showed you strong and glorious of all earthly men. You ruled over the expanse of your fatherland, and in all goods you made glad the hearts of all Christians in your charge. And with your courageous heart and the desire of honour you went out against the snake and opponent of the holy churches, judging that it would be intolerable for your heart to see the Christians of your fatherland conquered by the Mohammedans. And should you not succeed in this, to leave the passing greatness of earthly lordship, to adorn yourself with your crimson blood and unite with the warriors of the Heavenly King. And thus you fulfilled both desires; you slew the snake and received the wreath of martyrdom from the Lord above. And now do not leave your beloved children in oblivion, whom you have orphaned by your passing.... Come to our aid, wherever you may be. Look kindly on my little offering and consider them great, for I have not brought praise in the measure of your worth, but in the power of my humble reason -- therefore I expect modest rewards. Not so ungenerous were you, oh my dear liege and holy martyr, when you were in this transient world -- and how much more in the eternal and holy one you have received from God -- for you nourished abundantly a stronger, myself, in a foreign land. And now I beg you doubly: that you should nourish me still and calm the fierce storm in my soul and body. Jefimija offers this from her heart to you, Holy One! Jefimija's literary compositions are characterized by her use of the first person and by her expression of concrete and personal sorrow and anxiety rather than abstraction. This unhappy mother and unfortunate wife, who was able to convert her sorrow into beautiful art, died about 1405. Legacy She is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.

It is sited near the foot of a wide valley which leads to the pass known as the Umasi-la which joins Zanskar and Kishtwar. History Its foundation is attributed to Naropa (956-1041 CE), who was a celebrated Indian Buddhist yogi, mystic and monk from the renowned Vikramshila University in Bihar. He is said to have meditated in one of the two caves around which the gompa is built and the monastery is dedicated to him.

Biography Zhang was born into a scholarly family in Nanchong, Sichuan in 1872. Witnessing the turmoil at the end of the Qing Dynasty, Zhang was attracted to the reformist views of Liang Qichao, and he joined the group advocating constitutional monarchy for China. In 1911, Zhang was vice-chairman of the committee of shareholders that opposed the planned nationalization of the projected Sichuan-Hankou railroad. The protests against the plan swelled into an uprising that was easily quelled by authorities. Zhang remained a political leader in Sichuan province. In 1916, he organized a small force to act against Yuan Shikai, but Yuan died before the troops saw any action. Zhang served briefly in 1920 as governor of Sichuan province. In the following years, however, Zhang focused primarily on education. He served as president of Chengdu Normal College for two years before becoming president of Chengdu University in 1928. After the Second Sino-Japanese War began in 1937, Zhang was appointed a member of the National Political Council (ÂúãÊ∞ëÂèÉÊîøÊúÉ). Although he rarely participated in the body's deliberations, he was respected for his speeches criticizing the Nationalist government. When a number of opposition groups joined together to form the League of Chinese Democratic Political Groups in 1941, Zhang was elected chairman. As a non-partisan figure, he calmed disagreements between the various constituent groups of the League. He retained this position after the League's reorganization into the China Democratic League in 1944, and until his death in 1955. The China Democratic League was outlawed in 1947, after which Zhang was placed under house arrest in Shanghai. In the spring of 1949, he escaped with the aid of Chinese Communist Party agents and traveled to Beijing to assist in forming the new government. He headed the China Democratic League delegation to the first Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in September 1949, and was elected one of the Vice- chairmen of the Central People's Government after the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1. Zhang held this position until 1954, when the government was reorganized to have only one vice-chairman, at which time he was made a Vice Chair of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Zhang died of arteriosclerosis in February 1955 at the age of 84. He was survived by his wife, Liu Huicheng.

While the Hindu Bengalis, Chittagonians, Sylhetis, Rajbongshis, Odias, Assamese and Maithils worship the goddess Kali on this day, the rest of India and Nepal worships goddess Lakshmi on Diwali. History Artisan making an idol of goddess Kali at Kumortuli, Kolkata. The festival of Kali Puja is not an ancient one. Kali Puja was practically unknown before the 18th century; however, a late 17th-century devotional text Kalika mangalkavya ‚Äìby Balram mentions an annual festival dedicated to Kali.McDermott p. 373 It was introduced in Bengal during the 18th century, by King (Raja) Krishnachandra of Navadvipa. Kali Puja gained popularity in the 19th century, with Krishanachandra's grandson Ishvarchandra and the Bengali elite; wealthy landowners began patronizing the festival on a grand scale.McDermott p. 173 Along with Durga Puja, Kali Puja is the biggest festival in Bengal and Assam.McDaniel p. 223 Worship During kali puja (like Durga Puja) worshippers honour the goddess Kali in their homes in the form of clay sculptures and in pandals (temporary shrines or open pavilions). She is worshipped at night with Tantric rites and mantras. She is prescribed offerings of red hibiscus flowers, animal blood in a skull, sweets, rice and lentils, fish and meat. It is prescribed that a worshipper should meditate throughout the night until dawn.McDaniel p. 234 Homes and pandals may also practice rites in the Brahmanical (mainstream Hindu-style, non-Tantric) tradition with ritual dressing of Kali in her form as Adya Shakti Kali and no animals are sacrificed. She is offered food and sweets made of rice, lentils, and fruits. However, in Tantric tradition, animals are ritually sacrificed on Kali Puja day and offered to the goddess. A celebration of Kali Puja in Kolkata , Bhubaneswar and in Guwahati is also held in a large cremation groundFuller p. 86 where she is believed to dwell. Barasat, Madhyamgram region of North 24 Parganas is well known for their majestic pandals, lightings and Idols. Durga Puja of Kolkata is often said synonymously with Kali Puja of Barasat. The region experiences Lacs of footfalls during the days of the festival. People from different regions gather to witness the majestic Pandals. The pandals also house images of Kali's consort Shiva, two famous Bengali Kali devotees named Ramakrishna and Bamakhepa, along with scenes from mythology of Kali and her various forms, including images of the Mahavidyas, sometimes considered as the \\"ten Kalis.\\" The Mahavidyas is a group of ten Tantric goddesses headed by Kali.Kinsley p.18 People visit these pandals throughout the night. Kali Puja is also the time for magic shows, theater, and fireworks.McDaniel pp. 249-50, 54 Recent custom has incorporated wine consumption.Harding p. 134 In the Kalighat Temple in Kolkata, Kalikhetra Temple in Bhubaneswar and in Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati, Kali is worshipped as Lakshmi on this day so as to reflect an essence of Vaishnava Haldars on Kali worship. Goddess Lakshmi is worshiped in her three forms, Maha Lakshmi, Maha Kali and Maha Saraswati on this day. The temple is visited by thousands of devotees who give offerings to the goddess. Another famous temple dedicated to Kali in Kolkata is Dakshineswar Kali Temple, where the famous Kali devotee Ramakrishna lived and performed rites.See Harding pp. 125-6 for a detailed account of the rituals in Dakshineshwar. Other celebrations A Kali Puja pandal with a replica of the Kalighat Kali Temple icon. A child bursting firecracker in Bengal during Kali Puja Although the widely popular annual Kali Puja celebration, also known as the Dipanwita Kali Puja, is celebrated on the new moon day of the month of Kartika, Kali is also worshipped in other new moon days too. Two other major Kali Puja observations are Ratanti Kali Puja and Phalaharini Kali Puja. Ratanti puja is celebrated on Magha Krishna Chaturdashi and Phalaharini puja is celebrated on Jyeshta Amavashya of Bengali calendar. The Phalaharini Kali Puja is especially important in the life of the saint Ramakrishna and his wife Sarada Devi, since on this day in 1872, Ramakrishna worshipped Sarada Devi as the goddess Shodashi. In many Bengali and Assamese households, Kali is worshipped daily. Notes References * Fuller, Christopher John. The camphor flame: popular Hinduism and society in India. * Harding, Elizabeth U.

Prior to his unopposed election to the appeals court, Windhorst served as a judge of the 24th Judicial District Court in suburban New Orleans, Louisiana from 2000 to 2012. Earlier, from 1992 to 2000, Republican Windhorst was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from Jefferson and Orleans parishes. His father, Fritz Windhorst of Algiers, a neighborhood of New Orleans, served as a Democrat- turned-Republican in the Louisiana State Senate from Orleans and Jefferson parishes from 1972 to 1992. The Windhorsts are of German and Italian descent. Background Windhorst graduated from Roman Catholic Archbishop Shaw High School in Marrero in Jefferson Parish, where he was a three-year letterman in football and tennis. He received his Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor degrees from Tulane University in New Orleans. A P.O.S.T. certified police officer, Windhorst completed the Gretna Police Training Academy. He was a reserve police officer from 1985‚Äì1988 and an assistant district attorney and criminal prosecutor from 1982 to 1989. Legislative years In the nonpartisan blanket primary, also known as the jungle primary, held on November 16, 1991, Windhorst upset and unseated fellow Republican Representative Terry W. Gee, who had served since 1980, beginning with the gubernatorial term of Governor David C. Treen, then of Jefferson Parish. In the primary balloting on October 19, Gee led the balloting with 45 percent, compared to 37 percent for Windhorst. The remaining 18 percent was cast for the lone Democrat in the race, Cynthia Davidson. In the November 16 general election, Windhorst was the big winner with 61 percent to Gee's 39 percent. Windhorst was unopposed for re-election to the legislature in 1995 and 1999. In 1996, he lost, 56 to 44 percent, a bid for state judge to a longtime friend, Democrat Henry G. Sullivan Jr., in Division M. Windhorst later said that he should have waited to run for judge because he really preferred to have remained longer as a legislator. Judicial career Four years later, on October 7, 2000, Windhorst was elected judge of Division J of the 24th Judicial District Court. In the heated parishwide judicial race for the seat vacated by the death of incumbent Judge Sheldon Fernandez, Windhorst defeated the well-financed campaign of Democrat George P. \\"Pat\\" Hand, 56 percent to 44 percent, despite Hand's early start in the race and his support by Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish. Windhorst was supported by Gretna Police Chief B. H. Miller Jr. Most political observers considered this another upset victory by Windhorst. This Pat Hand should not be confused with former Judge Kernan \\"Skip\\" Hand, a Republican from Jefferson Parish and also a former legislator. Legislative career Drawing on his extensive experience as a criminal prosecutor and police training and experience, Windhorst became a leader in anti-crime and law enforcement legislation. In 1993, his second year in the House, he became a key floor leader for the Louisiana District Attorneys Association and the Louisiana Sheriffs Association, having handled many complicated law- enforcement bills. He pushed to fruition laws which permit violent or repeat juvenile offenders to be treated as adults at the ages of 15 and 16, and in limited cases, at 14 years of age. Windhorst also gained respect for his ability to handle a broad spectrum of complicated legislation. The Louisiana Association of Business and Industry recognized his ability to lead tough floor fights and debate. Although LABI had supported Windhorst's opponent, Representative Terry Gee in 1991, it soon aligned with Windhorst for his business-friendly positions. LABI then supported Windhorst in the 1995 and 1999 elections when he ran unopposed. Louisiana Welfare Reform Act of 1995 Despite major opposition by the administration and legislative leaders of Democratic Governor Edwin W. Edwards, Windhorst authored and obtained passage of the Louisiana Welfare Reform Act of 1995, which trimmed welfare benefits and attempted to eliminate additional benefits for the births of additional children while on Aid to Families with Dependent Children. According to Windhorst, the act was also necessary for Louisiana to implement the anticipated federal welfare reform by the Republican Congress during the Clinton administration later, known as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). House Leadership Role In January 1996, at the beginning of his second term and the first of Governor Murphy J. \\"Mike\\" Foster Jr., House Speaker Hunt Downer, a Democrat-turned-Republican from Houma, appointed Windhorst chairman of the House Administration of Criminal Justice Committee, through which all bills dealing with criminal law and gambling legislation must pass before moving to the full House of Representatives. Windhorst had been strongly opposed by some gambling interests, particularly Harrah's New Orleans Casino, but he was supported for the position by many sheriffs and district attorneys. Windhorst authored and claimed to have personally written all of the Foster administration's gambling reform legislation, which included public referenda and local options for parishes on all existing and future gambling. Anti-Tax Windhorst was a staunch fiscal conservative in the House, having refused to vote for any tax or general operating budget, contending that Louisiana was already spending twice what it needed. Government watchdog and critic C. B. Forgotston listed on his website Forgotston.com the votes of all legislators on tax issues, and showed that Windhorst was the only state legislator over a period of over two decades who never once voted for a new tax, a tax increase, or the extension of any existing tax. According to the Baton Rouge Business Report, Windhorst was known for a quick and sometimes sarcastic wit during legislative debate on the floor of the House. Once while under attack by an opponent, Rep. David Armstrong, a liberal New Orleans Democrat, who implied that he (Armstrong) might soon be elected to the Senate and kill Windhorst's bills there, Windhorst retorted, \\"Well, if you do get elected to the Senate, the quality of debate will dramatically improve in both chambers.\\" Awards and memberships In 1993, Windhorst was named \\"Legislator of the Year\\" by both Victims and Citizens Against Crime and the Alliance for Good Government. In 1995, Windhorst was again named \\"Legislator of the Year\\" by the Alliance for Good Government. In 2000, Windhorst was given the first and only \\"Craig L'Antigua Legislator of the Decade Memorial Award\\" by Victim and Citizens Against Crime, presented by its president and founder, Sanford Krasnoff. A Roman Catholic, he consistently supported the agenda of the Christian Coalition of America. He is a member of the Louisiana and Jefferson Parish bar associations, the Terrytown Civic Association, and the Republican Pachyderm Club of New Orleans. He is also affiliated with the Kiwanis Club and Citizens for a Clean and Beautiful West Jefferson. He is a former member of the Jaycees and serves on the Archbishop Shaw High School development bosard.

An instructional dance number, this song was one of several songs based on the jerk, a very popular 1960s \\"dance craze\\".http://motownjunkies.co.uk/2012/08/03/511/ Robinson and fellow Miracle Bobby Rogers were the song's producers. Described by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson as the intended follow-up song to the group's 1963 million- selling smash \\"Mickey's Monkey\\" the previous year, \\"Come On Do the Jerk\\" was actually recorded in a similar tempo. As the song begins, longtime Miracles drummer Donald \\"Spike\\" Whited and Miracles member, guitarist Marv Tarplin begin the song, while Smokey, as the song's narrator, offers the invitation: * Come on everybody, gather 'round * get hip to the new sensation * There's a brand new dance coming to your town * and it's sweepin' across the nation * Come on do the jerk The other Miracles, Ronnie White, Claudette Robinson, Pete Moore, and Bobby Rogers, echo Smokey's lead, with chants of the song's title, in classic call and response style. Then, midway through the song, Smokey's role changes... from narrator to dance instructor, as he instructs the listener on the Jerk's simple dance steps: *Now, snap your back... *like a bullwhip crack... *now jerk your hip.... *let your backbone slip... The Righteous Brothers, Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield, performed a cover of this song on a 1964 telecast of the ABC TV series, Shindig!.(available on YouTube).

August 1831 - d. 20 January 1883), also spelt as Rangacharlu, was an Indian civil servant and administrator who served as the Diwan of Mysore kingdom from 1881 to 1883. He was the first Diwan of Mysore following the restoration of monarchy in which Maharaja Chamaraja X promised to follow modern system of administration.  Early life  Rungacharlu was born in the Chingleput district, Madras Presidency in a Vadagalai Iyengar family. His father C. Raghavachariar was a clerk in the Chingleput Collectorate. Rungacharlu's parents were poor and only after V. Raghavachariar, the first Indian magistrate in Madras promised to support him financially, that Rungacharlu was able to pursue his schooling to Madras. As a child, Rungacharlu developed a passion for chess. Rungacharlu had his schooling at Pachaiyappa's School and the Madras High School passing his proficient's test in 1849 in first class. Immediately upon matriculating, Mr. Ellis appointed Rungacharlu as a clerk in the Madras Collectorate.  Early career  Rungacharlu began his career as an acting clerk in the Madras Collectorate. On confirmation, he was transferred to the Chingleput Collectorate and was soon promoted to Head Writer and put up in Salem. Rungacharlu performed well as a Head Writer and published two pamphlets - \\"Bribery and Corruption in the Revenue Department\\" and \\"Mirasi Rights in the Chingleput and Tanjore Districts\\". Soon, he was appointed Tahsildar of Saidapet and then, Head Sheristadar of Nellore. In 1859, he was appointed Special Assistant to G. N. Taylor, President of the Imam Commission. When the Imam Commission came to an end, Rungacharlu was appointed to the inquire into the working of the Indian Railways. Rungacharlu's performance in the commission won him rich accolades and when he returned to Madras, Rungacharlu was appointed Commissioner of the Madras Railway Company. He was serving as the Treasury Deputy Collector at Calicut in 1868, when he was invited to join the Mysore civil service.  In the Mysore service  Rungacharlu moved to Mysore in 1868 to take over as the Comptroller of the Mysore palace. As Comptroller, he wrote a pamphlet titled \\"The British Administration of Mysore\\" which was published in London in 1874. Soon afterwards, Mr. Gordon, the Commissioner of Mysore appointed Rungacharlu as his Revenue Secretary. As Revenue Secretary, Rungacharlu revamped the entire team of Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners substituted efficient Indians on moderate pay for inefficient Europeans drawing high salaries. As a result, the expenditure for his first year of service 1879-80 was reduced by rupees one and half lakhs. In appreciation of his services, Rungacharlu was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in the year 1880. At about this time, an inquiry was launched into the disappearance of certain jewels from royal household when Rungacharlu was the Palace Comptroller. After a detailed enquiry, the disappearance of the jewels was attributed to a clerical error and Rungacharlu was absolved of all the accusations. Rungacharlu was eventually appointed Diwan of Mysore on 25 March 1881.  Diwan of Mysore  When Rungacharlu took over as Diwan in March 1881, Mysore was faced with a poor financial, agricultural and industrial condition. The state was devastated by the famine of 1877 and faced with a debt of eight lakh rupees. Soon after Rungacharlu took over as Diwan, he disbanded Hassan and Chitradurga districts and downgraded nine taluks into Deputy Amildar sections. The number of Munsiff Courts, Sub-Courts and district jails were also reduced. These measures caused a drastic reduction in the expenses of the state. Rungacharlu also lifted the ban of the sale of sandalwood and sandalwood products. With the revenue generated by the sale of sandalwood, Rungacharlu developed an elaborate railway system for the princely state. He constructed a railway line from Bangalore to Tiptur and established a legislative assembly for the state.  Death  Rungacharlu fell seriously ill at the end of 1882. When the illness became critical, Rungacharlu resigned as Diwan. He was moved to Madras where he died on 20 January 1883.

Gaoxu fought with his elder brother Zhu Gaozhi for the throne. Early life Young Gaoxu was very interested in the military and was known as a great general. Fighting many battles against Mongol tribes with his father, Gaoxu become a favorite of Yongle for his military successes. But he disobeyed imperial instructions and was exiled to the small fief of Le'an in Shandong in 1416 and not allowed to leave the city without imperial permission. Rebellion In Shandong, Gaoxu lived as a farmer but secretly trained his army since he had always intended to rebel. Through the years, Gaoxu gained much more power and recruited many generals including General Wu Sien from the marine division. At the time his nephew became Xuande Emperor, Gaoxu started his rebellion. The new emperor himself led 20,000 troops in his attack against Gaoxu. General Wu Sien betrayed him and turned to attack Gaoxu. Soon afterward, Gaoxu lost the battle and then surrendered. He was reduced to a commoner, six hundred rebelling officials were executed, and 2,200 were banished. Death The Emperor did not wish to execute his uncle at the start, but later events angered the Emperor so much, that Zhu Gaoxu was executed through fire torture, and all Zhu Gaoxu's sons were executed as well. It is very likely that Zhu Gaoxu's arrogance, which is well detailed in many historic texts, offended the Emperor. A theory states that when the Emperor went to visit his uncle, Zhu Gaoxu intentionally tripped the Emperor.

It originally aired on Disney XD in the United States on September 21, 2009. In the episode, Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb travel into the future and have their time machine stolen by their older sister Candace, now an adult, who travels back in time to get her brothers in trouble during one of their outlandish schemes. In doing so, however, she sets off a chain reaction leading to a dystopian future ruled by the evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz. \\"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo\\" was written by Scott Peterson and directed by Zac Moncrief. The episode was conceived as a means of expanding the time machine plot that was introduced previously in the episode \\"It's About Time.\\" Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh, co-creators of Phineas and Ferb, centralized plot elements to satirize time travel films, such as The Time Machine (1960) and the Back to the Future trilogy (1985-1990). Multiple scenes in the episode were meant to be rather confusing and difficult to understand in order to interest viewers so they would watch the episode multiple times, trying to learn something new each time. The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. In its original broadcast, it ranked fourth in the key demographics Boys 6‚Äì14, Kids 6‚Äì11 and Boys 6‚Äì11, totaling 599,000 viewers, an 88 percent increase from that of the previous year's ratings in the timeslot. When it premiered on Disney Channel, it was the thirteenth-highest-ranked cable program for the entire week. It guest starred actors Jennifer Stone, Moises Arias, Noah Munck, and Jennifer Grey, along with the band Bowling for Soup, who appeared as themselves playing an extended version of the series' theme song, \\"Today is Gonna Be a Great Day,\\" which was also included on the official Phineas and Ferb soundtrack which was released on September 22, 2009. Plot summary Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb learn from their friend Baljeet that a tool they need for their latest project has yet to be invented. They and their friend Isabella borrow the time machine on display at the local museum to travel twenty years into the future. Once they arrive, Isabella stays behind with the time machine while the boys enter their sister Candace's backyard, where her sons Fred and Xavier are sitting under a tree doing nothing. The boys convince their future nephews to be active and in return are given the tool they need. As they leave, Candace spots them and it brings back upsetting memories of never being able to bust the boys. She takes her mother Linda to the museum where the boys leave, right before Linda can see them. Professor Onassis, who invented the time machine in the 1800s, arrives in the original version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed from the effects of the now-destroyed machine. Over time, everything is altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims to be a nice Emperor, though, since he can remember everyone's name (though this is considerably easier than it seems, since one of his rules is that everyone has to be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is now forced into an oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to use the time machine that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to stop herself from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring. The time machine gets destroyed so the two Candaces go to the backyard to convince the boys to fix the current time machine in the museum and take them back, creating a paradox and as a result, the Candace from the bleak future (wearing a white lab coat as seen in the picture above) ceases to exist. The boys then fix the machine. Isabella says to Ferb that a rollercoaster ride and time travel was a bonus. The present Candace tags along with her future self, Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella as they travel to the future (while Candace \\"finally\\" busting them in the process, but the future Linda is not angry at the boys, saying she doesn't have jurisdiction to bust the boys anymore). As Candace and the boys talk to the future Linda, Isabella sparks an idea and travels back in time. After returning to the present time, Candace leaves in victory, now happy that she had finally (technically) busted her brothers. During the credits, it reveals Isabella obtained the tool and gave it to the present day boys before they even time traveled in the first place. This causes them to change their minds about going into the future, thus, canceling out all the events that happened earlier in the episode and also causing all the characters involved in the future to cease existence (also erasing the \\"busting\\" present Candace caused, thus possibly causing a time loop). In \\"Summer Belongs To You\\", Phineas mentions time traveling twice and Isabella comments that Phineas has traveled through time \\"twice\\", but because of the events in the credits of Quantum Boogaloo, no-one - including Isabella should actually know about the time- traveling. During this episode, it is implied that Isabella marries either Phineas or Ferb, though none of the characters remember this. It is also implied that Phineas wins at least one Nobel Prize as the future Linda says the future Phineas is \\"in Switzerland for the Awards Ceremony.\\" Ferb is likely President of the United States as he is stated to be \\"at Camp David\\", a resort specially made for Presidents since Eisenhower. Production Series co- creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh cited the inspiration behind \\"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo\\" to the season 1 episode \\"It's About Time!\\" \\"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo\\" was written by Scott Peterson and directed by Zac Moncrief. Phineas and Ferb had previously produced an episode in season one's \\"It's About Time\\" which featured a time machine. Co-creator Dan Povenmire stated that he enjoyed the outcome of said episode. The writers purposely left the time machine available for the boys' use at the end of the episode so that they could reuse it in a later episode. Eventually, they conceived a plot where \\"Phineas and Ferb go into the future and actually see Candace as an adult (which) drags up all kinds of memories of not being able to bust them.\\" The scenes in which Candace travels back to the Phineas and Ferb building a roller coaster are taken from the pilot episode, \\"Rollercoaster.\\" Including the scenes was \\"great fun\\" for Povenmire and fellow co-creator Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh, who decided early on that using it would have \\"future Candace go back to the rollercoaster . Then whatever she did would affect the future, in this case give Doofenshmirtz the upper hand and effectively change history.\\" The inclusion was inspired by the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Trials and Tribble-ations,\\" in which the Deep Space 9 crew travel back in time to the Star Trek episode \\"The Trouble with Tribbles.\\" The novel approach was viewed by Marsh as \\"a great way to interweave a story.\\" The crew spent a long amount of time plotting out the episode in a room, using sticky notes, in order to make sure it played out sensibly and was clearly understandable to viewers.Marsh, 00:16 - 00:26 The production staff based a lot of the usage of time travel in \\"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo\\" on those from the Back to the Future trilogy (1985-1990) and H. G. Wells' The Time Machine (1960).Marsh, 01:48 - 01:53 The goal of the crew was to make sure everything stayed strong to a certain logical standpoint, which led to several surreal conversations,Marsh, 00:38 - 00:53 including several paradoxes involving time travel.Blum, 00:54 - 01:00 The crew members sought to venture into elements that seemed complicated, as their children viewers were deemed intelligent enough to understand such elements.Marsh, 02:27 - 02:43 The hopes of the production staff was to make the episode one that they could watch multiple times and notice something new with each viewing.Marsh, 02:45 - 02:58 Since Doofenshmirtz and Perry's actions tend to affect those of the boys, the choice to have future Candace's interference in the past greatly affect those of Doofenshmirtz and Perry's was considered the logical choice. Povenmire explained, \\"They affect each other in ways that we never fully understand, but if you throw off that little balance of power of their [respective] activities, all hell could break loose.\\" The song Doofenshmirtz sings, entitled \\"It's Been a Charmed Life,\\" was well-praised by the production crew, who felt that it was considerably well-handled.Marsh, 05:47 - 06:06 The song centralized the irony surrounding Doofenshmirtz having everything go well for him, a theme completely different from that which is generally touched upon in the series.Blum, 06:06 - 06:10Marsh, 06:10 - 06:21 Jennifer Stone guest starred in the episode as Amanda. The scene where Candace mentions that her best friend Stacy Hirano had become the president of Uruguay was originally written as a throwaway joke for the episode.Blum, 07:46 - 07:54Marsh, 07:55 - 08:04 During an e-mail exchange between the crew, some crew members were curious about the line and Povenmire came up with an entire back story, in which Stacy meets the prince of the country, moves there and, after changing several laws, becomes eligible for the presidency.Marsh, 08:06 - 08:46 The staff enjoyed the idea and wrote it down as a possible plot for a future episode.Marsh, 08:47 - 09:02 \\"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo\\" featured multiple guest appearances.Marsh, 10:11 - 10:13 Actress Jennifer Stone guest starred as Amanda, Candace's future daughter. Stone researched actress Ashley Tisdale's performance as Candace on YouTube to better grasp the attention needed on the voice role. Stone recorded her lines a long time before the final animation came in and was feeling impatient about how the end results would come out. Moises Arias, who is, according to Stone, \\"like [her] little brother,\\" voiced Candace's future son, Fred. Actress Jennifer Grey also appeared as a librarian. Grey's character in Ferris Bueller's Day Off was the inspiration for Candace and the actress had previously portrayed Doofenshmirtz's professor in \\"Oil on Candace.\\"Marsh, 10:36 - 11:08 \\"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo\\" originally broadcast on September 21, 2009, on Disney XD. Like all episodes of Phineas and Ferb, it carried a TV-G parental guidance rating. The song \\"Today is Gonna Be a Great Day\\" is available on the official Phineas and Ferb soundtrack, which was released on September 22, 2009, a day after the episode's broadcast. Cultural references \\"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo\\" serves as a parody of time travel films, particularly the Back to the Future film series and H. G. Wells' The Time Machine. Candace stealing the time machine to change something in the past, thus creating a dystopian future, mirrors the scene in Back to the Future Part II (1989), in which Biff Tannen steals the Delorean time machine and causes a dark and chaotic future in the process. In the future, the American pop-punk band Bowling for Soup appears and performs an extended version of the series' theme song. The band members were designed to look twenty years older and having gained weight. Reception \\"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo\\" ranked fourth in its timeslot, in the demographics Boys 6‚Äì14, Kids 6‚Äì11 and Boys 6‚Äì11. It averaged 599,000 total viewers, an 88 percent increase over the previous year's record for the timeslot. In Kids 6‚Äì14, it outranked previous year's records by 152 percent. In Boys 6‚Äì14, it claimed over a 121 percent increase, in Boys 6‚Äì11, it garnered an over 116 percent increase, and in Boys 9-14, an over 138 percent registered increase. When the episode aired on Disney Channel for the first time, it was watched by 2.7 million American households and 3.9 million individual viewers, placing it at number 13 in cable network ratings for the entire week. The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. Matt Blum of Wired called it \\"probably the geekiest episode of the show so far\\". Blum praised the joke about Stacy becoming the president of Uruguay and called Doofenshmirtz's song \\"It's Been a Charmed Life\\" \\"heavy irony.\\"Blum, 06:05 - 06:10 Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun-Times considered the episode one of September 21's television highlights, writing that she \\"could not be more excited.\\" News OK listed the episode on its \\"Top 55 TV Programs for Sept. 20-26, 2009\\", and all three guest stars appeared on its list of \\"Top 30 Guest Stars on TV Shows airing Sept. 20-26, 2009\\". Povenmire considered the episode one of his favorites of the series.

It is a area containing 79 buildings. Most of the buildings date to the 19th and early 20th centuries, and some represent important milestones in the history of Salem, possibly the oldest continuously inhabited village in the county and one of the first in the state to incorporate. The buildings that survived a devastating 1840 fire have been preserved relatively intact. In 1975 the area was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography The district is cross-shaped. It includes all properties on either side of Main from the former Delaware and Hudson Railroad tracks on the north end to Park Place at the south. The railroad tracks' intersection with County Route 30 also serve as the western boundary, with the former county courthouse being the eastern limit along County Route 153. The boundary extends from the roads. This area of includes 79 buildings, all but ten of which date to the late 19th century. The portions of Main Street and Broadway east of it are densely developed, with commercial properties near the center yielding to residences away from them. Route 153 is less dense, with mature trees forming a buffer leading to the county courthouse complex and Salem High School. History Salem was first settled around 1761 by three men from Pelham, Massachusetts, making it one of the earliest settlements in the county. The site of their log cabins, long since gone, is now occupied by the Abrams Building on North Main Street. They brought their families along three years later, and obtained a patent for of land in the area from the colonial governor after promising two colonial officials that they would give those officials half of the land. At the time the area was part of a larger subdivision known as Charlotte County. Those two officials sold their half to an Irish minister who had brought his followers to the North American colonies to escape religious persecution. This led to the construction of a schoolhouse and church, the first in the county and one of only two at the time north of Albany. The two groups lived in relative harmony. Shortly after the Revolutionary War began, in 1777, General Philip Schuyler of the Continental Army ordered the town evacuated in the face of John Burgoyne's advances into the area during the Saratoga Campaign. Some of the men stayed behind, dismantling the schoolhouse's logs to erect Fort Salem around the site of the First Presbyterian Church on East Broadway. It was burned in September of that year by local Loyalists. One local man, John Williams, raised a local regiment and distinguished himself as a leader during the war and was eventually commissioned a colonel. At the war's end he retired with the rank of brigadier general and built a large house on what is now East Broadway. For many years it was the largest and most elaborate in the village. The oldest surviving house in the village, the Judge Blanchard home on East Broadway, is the only building to show clear influence of the Georgian architectural style common before the Revolution. It is a frame building on a raised foundation with symmetrical fenestration and a Palladian window above the entrance. It was built in 1790, before the emergence of the Federal style, exemplified by the Judge McLean home further down the street with its elliptical fanlight and sidelights at the main entrance. The next year, Washington Academy was founded, the sixth school in the state to be formally incorporated. In 1803 Salem was incorporated as a village, one of the first in the state. Eight years later, a new school building was built on West Broadway, the first of several on the site. Many other early buildings, and the records of Salem's early history, were destroyed by a large fire in 1840. An ultimate result of this was the construction of the Proudfit Building at the junction of the two routes, which serves as municipal offices, public library, theater and headquarters for the fire and police departments. It was built with $10,000 left to the village for the purpose by a local bank president, on the condition that matching funds be raised. The Proudfit family contributed half of those funds and the building was named after them out of gratitude. In 1939 the school district was centralized. The last of the school buildings downtown was converted into apartments, and a new building was built on the grounds of the former Williams estate. Significant contributing properties *Judge Blanchard House, East Broadway. Dating to 1790, this is the oldest house in the village. It shows a strong Georgian influence. *First Presbyterian Church, East Broadway. Its front portico with full-height Doric columns is one of the strongest Greek Revival buildings in the village. *Proudfit Building, West Broadway and South Main Street. Built in 1890, this ornate brick and stucco structure serves as village hall, the public library and a theater. It has been considered the center of the village since it was first built. *Proudfit- Sherman House, East Broadway. The best Greek Revival house in the village has a front portico similar to the Presbyterian church's except with Ionic columns. *Washington County Courthouse, West Broadway. Except for the removal of the bell tower, this ornate brick structure is as it was when built in 1869. Preservation In 2008 the village government created a Historic Preservation Commission to preserve the historic character of the district. It consists of five members appointed by the mayor serving staggered three-year terms. Two must be resident property owners in the district, one must be an architect with experience in preservation, and another must be a historian.Village of Salem, ; January 9, 2008. Retrieved October 18, 2009. It reviews all exterior construction or renovation within the district requiring a building permit. It is also empowered to carry out surveys of the district and recommend new properties for designation as a local landmark.

She is portrayed by Amy Poehler. For most of the show's run, she serves as Deputy Director of the Parks and Recreation Department of the fictional city of Pawnee, Indiana. An over-achiever, Knope believes the government should serve the people. The character has evolved greatly over the 7 seasons, initially portrayed by Amy Poehler as an exaggerated scatterbrain before gradually shifting to a more subtle performance. Poehler's performance as Leslie Knope has been nominated for several awards, winning a 2014 Golden Globe. Background Knope was born on January 18, 1975 (S4: E3) in Eagleton, Indiana due to a raccoon infestation in Pawnee, and has lived in Pawnee, Indiana since infancy. According to the show's timeline, her father died in 1985 (S5: E14). She was inspired to pursue a life of public service by the community programs she enjoyed as a child. While attending Pawnee North High School she served as Co-Vice President of the student body and participated in several student organizations including the Model United Nations, Debate Club, Mock Trial, Young Republicans, Young Democrats, and the Young Independents, which she founded. She graduated in the top five percent of her high school class and summa cum laude from Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA). In the first three seasons, Leslie is the Deputy in Pawnee's Parks and Recreation Department, a mid-level bureaucratic position; in season 4, she successfully campaigns to become a member of the city council. In her role as Deputy Director she serves on several committees, including the Equal Opportunity Committee, the Fun in the Sun Committee, the Clean Restroom Task Force, the Handicapped Restroom Task Force, and the Task Force to Reduce the Number of Public Restrooms. She hopes to improve her town and to advance her career (possibly aiming to become the City Manager). She has also stated her ultimate goal of becoming the first female President of the United States. Knope proudly displays in her office images of Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice, Dianne Feinstein, Janet Reno, Nancy Pelosi, and Larry Bird. Leslie also has a love for sweets, especially waffles (which she frequently orders in large quantities at J.J.'s Diner) and whipped cream, which she puts on coffee, waffles, etc. On November 10, 2016, a member of the Parks and Recreation's writing staff wrote an open letter for Vox from the fictional character Leslie Knope on the election results. Personality Leslie Knope is extremely cheerful, ambitious, hard-working and optimistic. She is firmly committed to the belief that government should provide a service for its people, and regularly goes above and beyond for the benefits of Pawnee's residents ‚Äî a belief that regularly clashes with her superior Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), a staunch libertarian who feels all government should be dissolved and privatized. Although somewhat naive, she is intelligent, well-read, and has good intentions, but is not always successful in executing her goals. She repeatedly tries to put a positive spin on failure, even to the point where she will occasionally distort the truth in her own view. For example, she does not get discouraged by angry residents who complain or yell during her public forums, but instead prefers to think of them as \\"people caring loudly at me\\". Many of her co-workers do not share her enthusiasm, but Leslie commands their respect nonetheless. Her ambition occasionally annoys her colleagues and leads to ribbing against her, especially from her subordinate Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari). Her favorite food is waffles from a local diner, JJ's. She has a crush on former Vice President Joe Biden, and harbors an irrational hatred of public libraries, salads, and the wealthy neighboring town of Eagleton‚Äîwhich Leslie found out, to her sheer horror, was actually her birthplace. Leslie views herself as a budding political star in the style of Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, and Condoleezza Rice. She has been widely lauded as a positive figure for advancing gender equality and feminism because she represents a strong woman who encourages others to empower themselves and support the women around them. Although she is shown to be running for the city council as an independent, she joins the Democratic Party at some point, as she is approached by \\"Janet from the DNC\\" about a potential gubernatorial bid in the final season. Storyline Season one Initially she is shown to harbor romantic feelings for her co-worker Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), likely stemming from a romantic liaison with him several years before. She is also desperate to impress her mother, Marlene Griggs-Knope (Pamela Reed), a well-known politician in the Pawnee government. At a public forum, she meets Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones), who informs her about a gaping hole near her house that her boyfriend, Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), fell into. Leslie takes on the project and quickly becomes friends with Ann. She has a difficult relationship with her mother, a tough and tactless woman who has had a long and successful career in local government and who does not think much of her daughter's professional or personal choices. Season two Leslie seems to move on from her romantic interest in Mark and begins dating police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.). She also begins taking charge and gains a lot of confidence. Also, more of her relationships with her coworkers are shown. Towards the end of the season, Dave, who is enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve, is called into active duty in San Diego, where he does custodial work. Dave asks Leslie to move with him to San Diego, and although she considers it, she ultimately declines because she loves her work and Pawnee too much to leave, and they part ways amicably. She then dates an old lawyer friend of Ann's named Justin (Justin Theroux). Although Justin seems to be a perfect guy and has many interesting stories, Leslie soon realizes that stories are all Justin cares about. After he reunites Leslie's mother with an old flame over Leslie's constant protests, she breaks up with him after realizing that Justin cares more about the reunion story that he could potentially tell than he does about her. At the end of the season, Leslie and the rest of the department get a visit from two state auditors, Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) and Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), who shut down the government due to Pawnee's crippling financial problems. Leslie and Ben have an antagonistic relationship at first, but soon develop romantic feelings for each other. Season three In this season, Leslie works on the Harvest Festival in hopes of bringing money to Pawnee. She and Ben are no longer at odds and develop a friendly working relationship, complicated by romantic feelings. However, their budding relationship is threatened by Chris' intra-office dating rules, and they attempt to keep their romance under wraps, despite telling Ann, Ron, Leslie's mother, and a maintenance worker at the memorial service for Lil' Sebastian, Pawnee's beloved, recently deceased \\"mini-horse\\". In the season finale, Leslie is approached by a group of people who look for talent in government with the potential for political careers. They tell Leslie that they believe she has the potential to become a member of city council, or even the mayor. Season four Leslie comes to realize that while she is running for city council, her relationship with Ben cannot continue, and they reluctantly break up. Leslie then announces her city council candidacy. Leslie writes a book called Pawnee: The Greatest Town in America. She also finds out that she was actually born in Eagleton because her mother said \\"the Pawnee hospital had been overrun by raccoons.\\" Leslie and Ben struggle with being broken up; Leslie wants to remain friends with Ben, but he tells her it's just too hard for him. Leslie finally decides she wants to be with Ben, no matter the consequences, and they get back together. Ben resigns from his position in order to save Leslie from getting fired. Her campaign managers inform her that they can no longer run her campaign because her approval ratings are dismally low after the news of her relationship with Ben was revealed. The rest of the Parks employees (and Ann), on a mission to return the love Leslie has shown them over the years, tell Leslie that they will run her campaign for her, allowing her to continue going after her dream. After several tumultuous months, it is announced that Bobby Newport (Paul Rudd), son of Sweetums founder Nick Newport (Christopher Murray), has won by 21 votes. Ben later approaches officials and notifies them that it is the law that they re-count, since it was so close. Ann then reveals to Leslie that really she beat Bobby by 21 votes. Season five In the beginning of the season, she and Ben get engaged and move into a house together. She and Ben get married in the middle of the season, months earlier than the couple had originally planned. They initially arrange to marry at a black tie event they planned and executed to raise money for the future park at Pawnee Commons. However, Leslie's City Council nemesis Jeremy Jamm (Jon Glaser) disrupts the ceremony by setting off stink bombs and booing Leslie, leading to Ron punching him in the face and getting them both arrested. However, the Parks and Recreation Department plans a secret wedding that same night in the office area, and Ron walks Leslie down the aisle. During her first year as city councilor, she passes a city-wide soda tax, merges the animal control and parks department, and secures the money for the Pawnee Commons. At the end of the season, the Sweetums Corporation, a major manufacturer of sugary snacks and Pawnee's biggest employer, begins a campaign to recall her. Season six Leslie is a key member in the absorbing of Eagleton into Pawnee because of a debt problem in Eagleton. After staging a filibuster which wins the citizens of former Eagleton voting rights, Leslie is recalled and replaced with her Eagletonian counterpart, Ingrid de Forest (Kristen Bell). Leslie gets the lot and park for the Pawnee Commons after a heated debate between her and Jamm, in return for five worthless IOU's from Chris (who was soon leaving his post as City Manager). She dedicates the unofficial groundbreaking of Pawnee Commons to Ann before she and Chris leave for Michigan in \\"Ann and Chris\\". In \\"Flu Season 2\\", Leslie discovers that she is pregnant. In \\"One in 8,000\\", after a visit to a doctor, Ben and Leslie find out that they are going to have triplets. Soon after, Leslie is offered a position in the National Park Service, in Chicago. After stalling on her decision for most of the season, Leslie is eventually convinced by Ben to accept the job, but then after finding out that the Parks Department had her declared as one of the new founders of the new town of Pawnee, she convinces her new boss to relocate their office from Chicago to the Third Floor of Pawnee City Hall. Three years from the end of season six, Leslie and Ben have three children, and Leslie is the head of the Midwest Parks Service in the bustling third floor of Pawnee City Hall. Season seven Leslie is head of the Midwest branch of the National Park Service, working to build a National Park in Pawnee. Ron is her main opponent in this effort, as he wants to build a new Gryzzl campus. As the season progresses, however, Ron and Leslie eventually reconcile, and she gives Pawnee its National Park. Soon afterwards, she and Ben decide to move to Washington with Andy and his wife April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) after Leslie is offered a promotion to work at the U.S. Department of the Interior and Ben decides to run for Congress. In flash forwards, it is shown that by the year 2025, Leslie will run a successful campaign for Governor of State of Indiana, and will serve two terms in that office. It is implied that either she or Ben has been elected President of the United States by 2048, when they are both flanked by the U.S. Secret Service at the funeral of Pawnee Mayor (and Leslie's former Parks employee) Jerry Gergich (Jim O'Heir). In the present, the gang gets together for a picture, as they are unsure when the next time they see each other will be. Ben asks Leslie if she's ready, to which she responds, \\"Yes. I'm ready.\\" Development The concept for Parks and Recreation did not start to form until series creators Greg Daniels and Michael Schur learned Poehler would be available to play the lead character. Once that casting was determined, the general concept for both the series and the Leslie Knope character was established. After the first season, changes were made to Leslie's character to make her appear more intelligent. Schur said this was in response to critical feedback that Leslie came across as \\"ditzy\\" during the show's first run of episodes, which Schur said was never their intention. Schur said that the show considered a backstory element for Leslie where she had been elected mayor while a teenager; this story was later used for the Ben Wyatt character. Amy Poehler said by the third season, after the Parks Department has been shut down for three months due to a budget crisis, Leslie has started to face reality more clearly and realize the department is a low priority. Critical reception She was listed in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. In 2015, Entertainment Weekly named Knope as one of the 25 Best TV Characters of the Past 25 Years. Poehler has garnered six Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, three Golden Globe Award nominations, and three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series for her role. In 2014, while hosting the ceremony, Poehler won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Musical or Comedy for her portrayal of Leslie Knope. Season one Despite mixed reviews of the first season, one fairly consistent source of praise went to Amy Poehler for her performance as Leslie Knope. Tom Shales of the Washington Post writes that \\"Poehler's show unfortunately isn't worthy of her\\". Daniel Carlson of The Hollywood Reporter also had praise for Poehler claiming that she \\"has the comic intelligence to carry a series like this one\\" and delivers a performance that is \\"awkward but not alienating\\" and \\"eager without being repelling\\". However, several commentators said the naive and well-meaning Leslie Knope character too closely resembled The Office protagonist Michael Scott (Steve Carell), a well-intentioned but dimwitted manager of a paper company sales office. Season two James Poniewozik of Time magazine praised the development of the characters. He thought that the show \\"really has a handle now\\" on the main character Leslie Knope, and does an \\"excellent job of finding things for its supporting characters to do\\". He also opined that the series is \\"living up to its potential now\\". Commentators said the supporting cast was now working with better material and that Amy Poehler's character had improved and become less over-the-top and more human than in the first season. Season three By season three, Paste magazine writer Garrett Martin called Leslie \\"one of the most relatable and admirable women on television\\".

She was the only Coast and Geodetic Survey ship to bear the name and the last sailing vessel owned and operated by the Survey. Matchless was built at Key West, Florida, in 1859. The Coast and Geodetic Survey acquired her in 1885 and placed her in service that year. She was rebuilt at a cost of $50,000 (USD) in 1895. On February 28, 1915, officers and crew of Matchless helped put out a fire on Main Street in Edenton, North Carolina. On September 16, 1917, she helped the steamer White Wings off a shoal. While returning from Roanoke Island to Elizabeth City, North Carolina after completion of work in Croatan and Roanoke Sounds the Matchless was caught and held in ice from about December 24, 1917 until January 17, 1918. The ship then engaged in surveys requested by the Navy in the lower Chesapeake Bay, the York River and Mattaponi River during the first half of 1918. In her last years Matchless was used \\"as a house-boat\\" from which parties surveyed inland waters. She was surveyed and condemned in 1919, retired from Coast and Geodetic Survey service and sold June 28, 1919. The crew from the Matchless transferred to the steamer USC&GS; Onward with the task of continuing the surveys in the York River and west shore of Chesapeake Bay.

Lagascea is a member of the same subtribe Helianthinae as the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus, but it looks different because it has heads that are reduced to have 1 (or 2) flowers, and are clustered into compound units that mimic heads and are sometimes called syncephalia.Harris, E.

Both species are annual herbs growing to approximately 40 cm in height. The strap-shaped leaves up to 10 cm in length are covered with short hairs. Flower heads are produced on stalks well above the main leaves, and have yellow centres with pink or occasionally white bracts. Flowering usually occurs in spring or summer in years with good cool season rain.Corrick, M.G., Alexander, B. 2002. ‚ÄúWildflowers of Southern Western Australia‚Äù Five Mile Press, Noble Park.

Luanda was granted the status of city in 1605. The fortified Portuguese towns of Luanda (established in 1575 with 400 Portuguese settlers) and Benguela. History The Portuguese, Paulo Dias de Novais secured a grant allowing him to colonize what is now Angola. In exchange for agreeing to raise private funds to finance his expedition, bring Portuguese colonists and build forts in the country, the crown gave him rights to conquer and rule the sections south of the Kwanza River To the south of the Kingdom of the Kongo, around the river Kwanza, there were various important states, of which the Kingdom of Ndongo - located in the highlands between the Kwanza and Lukala Rivers - ruled by the Samara (Queen), was the most significant. Dias de Novais arrived in Angola with an armed force and more Jesuit priests. Originally he planned to offer his small force as a mercenary reinforcement to Ndongo and to Kongo for their various wars. After indifferent success, a Portuguese who had long resided in Kongo, Francisco Barbuda, persuaded the king of Ndongo that Portugal intended to take his country over. Acting on this intelligence, the king ordered the Portuguese to be killed and expelled. War In 1579 therefore, Ndongo made a sudden and devastating war on the Portuguese (and their many servants and slaves, many of whom were from Kongo) and drove them from Ndongo back to a few holdings in the region around Luanda. The Portuguese were aided in their defense by Kongo, whose king √Ålvaro I, sent a large army in his support and to attack Ndongo in revenge for the slaughter of Kongo slaves. Although Kongo's army was defeated trying to cross the Bengo River and ran out of supplies, Dias de Novais managed to hold on to Luanda and the small fort of Nzele on the Kwanza River. Further expansion From 1575 to 1589 when he died, Dias de Novais sought to recover and expand Portuguese possessions in the Kwanza Valley. He did so largely by making alliances with local rulers who were disaffected with Ndongo rule, notably the ruler (soba) of Muxima. In this effort, Portuguese managed to take over the province of Ilamba located between the Kwanza and Bengo Rivers, and in a hard-fought battle in 1582, founded the post at Massangano at the confluence of the Kwanza and Lucala Rivers. Emboldened by victories over Ndongo armies in 1583 and 1585, Dias de Novais' lieutenant Luis Serr√£o, who took over the colony following Dias de Novais' death in 1589 led an attack on Ndongo's capital at Kabasa. This attack, however, was a spectacular failure, as Ndongo, allied with its neighbor Matamba crushed the Portuguese army and drove it back to Massangano. Stalemate The following period was a stalemate, capped by a peace agreement in 1599. Portuguese governors in the interim, finding themselves too weak to attack Ndongo, were content with engaging in political wrangling with the kingdom and with seeking opportunities to use its own political conflicts to their advantage. Philip of Spain King Philip, disappointed with the revenue generated from taxing trade, sent Manuel Cerveira Pereira to Benguela in 1610 to take control of the copper in inner Angola. Philip hoped to construct artillery with Angolan copper and send the artillery to Portuguese- ruled Brazil while selling defeated natives as slaves from the port in Benguela. Francisco Correia da Silva was initially supposed to serve as Portugal's administrator in Angola in 1611, but never assumed the office. Instead, the King appointed Bento Banha Cardoso, a soldier who had served in Angola since 1592, as interim governor. Governor Cardoso's predecessor, Forjaz Pereira, allied with the Imbangala against other native tribes, an alliance that lasted for decades. During Cardoso's tenure, from 1611 to 1619 the Imbangala expanded the Portuguese Empire eastward while providing a reliable, steady source of slaves. The descendants of Imbangala warriors and conquered peoples formed the kingdoms of Kasange and Matamba In 1610, Friar Luis Brand√£o, the head of Portuguese-run Luanda college, wrote to a Jesuit who questioned the legality of the enslavement of native Angolans, saying, \\"We have been here ourselves for forty years and there have been many learned men here and in the province of Brazil who never have considered the trade illicit.\\" He further stated that only a small number of Natives may have been enslaved illegally, and that the Portuguese at least converted them to Christianity. Trade In 1611, the eastern Kongo exported 100,000 meters of cloth to Angola. Traders sold much of the cloth to Europeans. Angola exported slaves at a rate of 10,000 per year in 1612. Queen Nzinga in peace negotiations with the Portuguese governor in Luanda, 1657. The Portuguese built a new port in Benguela in 1616 to expand Portugal's access to Angolan slaves. In 1618 the Portuguese built Fortaleza S√£o Pedro da Barra fortress, followed by the Fortaleza de S√£o Miguel fortress in 1634. Luanda was Portuguese Angola's administrative centre from 1627, with one exception. At the time of the arrival of the Portuguese, Ngola Kiluange was in power, and by maintaining a policy of alliances with neighboring states, managed to hold out against the foreigners for several decades. Eventually, he was beheaded in Luanda. Queen Jinga Years later, the Ndongo rose to prominence again when Jinga Mbandi, known as Queen Jinga, took power. A wily politician, she kept the Portuguese in check with carefully prepared agreements. After undertaking various journeys she succeeded in 1635 in forming a grand coalition with the states of Matamba and Ndongo, Kongo, Kasanje, Dembos and Kissamas. At the head of this formidable alliance, she forced the Portuguese to retreat. Fitful negotiations followed, and in 1639 Njinga concluded peace with Portugal.

AFSA members are leaders in their schools and communities, and are charged with the privilege and responsibility of helping to mold our nation's students into successful, mindful individuals. As school leaders, AFSA members are constantly advocating for better public schools and systems of education. With regard to education reform, AFSA members support reforms that put students first and include school administrators in the discussion and implementation. As a union affiliated with the AFL-CIO, AFSA members recognize the importance of collective bargaining rights and their right to organize. AFSA members are active in the labor movement and proudly stand in solidarity with all trade unionists and school administrators. History The 1960s: CSA is Formed The union's origins dates back to the 1960s. In the New York City public education system of the '60s teachers waged their first strike on Nov. 7, 1960, leading to notable pay raises. School supervisors found their salaries lagging behind the teachers. The presidents of the 11 supervisory groups united to lobby the legislature for higher wages, organizing as the Council of Supervisory Associations. Dr. Benjamin E. Strumpf, an assistant superintendent in the Bronx, was named president of the new independent association in January 1962, a part-time post. The following year, the supervisors won a pay raise. Walter J. Degnan, the principal of DeWitt Clinton High School, succeeded Strumpf as CSA president. High School Chairman Al Morrison became the part-time executive director for CSA and successfully lobbied for legislation mandating a salary index for supervisors. CSA's hard work and reputation for winning results led to its being regarded as the voice (unofficially) for supervisors on workplace issues, including salary, hours of work and working conditions. CSA continued its fight representing the interests of its members, setting its sights on obtaining official recognition, salary increases and a grievance procedure. In May 1965, CSA signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the board of education that provided for monthly consultations between CSA and the superintendent of schools, as well as annual meetings with the board of education to discuss education policy, working conditions, salary schedules and grievances. During the 1965 school year, CSA members elected high school principal Stuart Lacey to lead them as president. That year, CSA negotiated a choice of three health benefit plans, fully paid by the employer, as part of the new Welfare Fund. During the summer of 1967, conflict erupted in New York City as Ocean Hill, Two Bridges and P.S. 201 became battlegrounds for teachers and supervisors. As school opened in September 1967, the United Federation of Teachers went on strike to protest the chaos. Joseph Brennan, a high school principal, was CSA president. Over the objections of CSA, more than 700 members of the Association of Assistant Principals participated in a one-day work stoppage in support of the teachers. It was the first school supervisors‚Äô strike in history. Michael Romano succeeded Joseph Brennan in the spring of 1968 as CSA president. CSA Makes History In the fall of 1968, Walter J. Degnan again took the reins as CSA president. President Degnan made history when he negotiated the first comprehensive written contract for supervisors in the country, a three-year pact effective Oct. 1, 1969. He became CSA's first full-time paid president on Jan. 1, 1970. Throughout the early '70s, New York City experienced a fiscal crisis and as a result, the legislature abolished the salary index and tenure for supervisors. The time was ripe for CSA to affiliate with a labor organization for greater power and strength. The Next Step: SASOC Forges Into the Seventies In 1971, CSA joined the AFL-CIO as Local 1, creating a distinct national entity in addition to CSA, known as the School Administrators and Supervisors Organizing Committee (SASOC). This move was significant because it meant that now CSA and its national entity, SASOC, had the strength and power of hundreds of thousands of other union members behind them At the beginning of the 1973 school year, Walter J. Degnan resigned as CSA president to become the first president of the national union. Emanuel Munice assumed the CSA presidency. CSA members voted for a constitutional change that called for a new full-time executive vice president position. In February 1974, an election was held and Peter S. O‚ÄôBrien, an elementary school principal, was named CSA president; his running mate, longtime activist Jack Zuckerman, became CSA's first full-time executive vice president. The union continued to fight for the rights of supervisors, organizing new members along the way. SASOC's growth was remarkable, having grown to 47 locals as of 1976. President Degnan was ready to take SASOC to the next level. If SASOC were to undergo a change in status to an international union, it would mean a greater voice for members. As an international union, SASOC would have equal standing with other international unions, as well as a seat at the table of the AFL-CIO General Board as an equal partner and independent union representing all educational administrators and supervisors in the country. In order to move from an organizing committee to an international union, SASOC needed to meet certain criteria: (1) be self-sustaining; (2) be representative of a group; (3) be representative geographically of the United States; and (4) show numerical growth. SASOC made its move and petitioned the AFL-CIO for a change in status from an organizing committee to an international union. Under the leadership of then-President George Meany, the AFL-CIO's Executive Council examined SASOC's growth and achievements over the previous five years and approved the change in status. In the previous 35 years, the AFL-CIO had granted such a charter to only two groups‚Äîthe farm workers and SASOC. AFSA: The Dream is Realized On July 7, 1976, the first constitutional convention of the new organization was held at the Americana Hotel in New York City. Delegates to the convention adopted a constitution, elected officers and a General Executive Board, and named the new national AFL-CIO affiliate. Officers Ernest A. Logan was elected AFSA president by acclamation during the 15th Triennial Constitutional Convention in July 2018. He was elected vice- president of the AFL-CIO in September 2018 and now sits on its Executive Council. Leonard P. Pugliese is currently the executive vice president of AFSA. Prior to attaining this position, Dr. Pugliese served AFSA as general vice president and more recently as the AFSA secretary-treasurer. At the local level, he served as the president of the City Association of Supervisors and Administrators (CASA), AFSA Local 20 in Newark, New Jersey, from 1997 to 2012; he currently serves as CASA's executive director. Lauran Waters-Cherry is currently serving as the Secretary-Treasurer of AFSA.

He ruled the Genevois, but not the city of Geneva proper, and it was during his time that the term \\"Genevois\\" came to be used as it is today. He was the eldest son and successor of William III and Agnes, daughter of Amadeus V of Savoy. He played a major r√¥le in the politics of the House of Savoy, serving consecutively as regent and president of the council, and also sitting on the feudal tribunal‚Äîone of three tribunals of the Audiences g√©n√©rales‚Äîof the Duchy of Aosta. Conflict with Savoy After the city and castle of Annecy were devastated in a fire in 1320, Amadeus moved his court to La Roche, which had been the seat of the counts of Geneva between 1124 and 1219. In 1325 Amadeus joined the coalition formed by Guigues VIII of Viennois against Edward of Savoy. On 7 August he fought in the victory of the Battle of Varey over the Savoyards.Eugene L. Cox (1967), The Green Count of Savoy: Amadeus VI and Transalpine Savoy in the Fourteenth Century (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press), 37‚Äì38. In 1326 the envoys of Charles IV of France negotiated a truce so that both counts, of Geneva and of Savoy, could join the king's expedition against Flanders in 1327‚Äì28. In January 1329 the new Count Aymon of Savoy came to terms with Amadeus, and the two established a commission to investigate the disputed territory between the Duingt and the Faverges. Ultimately Amadeus became a vassal of Aymon for at least a part of his territories. In 1338 another commission was established to deal with further boundary issues. The relationship between the peaceable and unambitious counts of Geneva and Savoy were, after 1337, always friendly. In 1336 Amadeus donated the village of V√©senaz to the monastery of Bellerive. The Castle of Chamb√©ry, showing the Sainte-Chapelle where Amadeus III stood godfather at his cousin's baptism, and where later he lived during his regency of the county of Savoy. Regency of Savoy On 11 January 1334 Amadeus stood godfather to his first cousin Amadeus VI of Savoy in the Sainte-Chapelle, then under construction, at Chamb√©ry.Cox, 13. He and Louis II of Vaud were designated by Aymon as regents for the young Amadeus, which roles they assumed on Aymon's death on 22 June 1343. On 26 June, after Aymon's funeral, the young Amadeus was crowned as Count of Savoy and Amadeus of Geneva was the first to swear the oath of fealty. The count of Geneva and the lord of Vaud moved into the Castle of Chamb√©ry and signed a written agreement, still preserved, whereby neither could act without the consent of the other, and all acts were to be committed to writing for purposes of review.Cf. Cox, 34‚Äì36, for the details of the regency council laid down in Aymon's will. In the details of this agreement considerable mutual suspicion can be detected. The lord of Vaud was the senior statesman of the House of Savoy, while Amadeus III was the head of its chief rival. The first concern of the regents of Savoy after 1343 was securing the succession against the claims of Joan, daughter of Edward of Savoy, who died on 29 June 1344, but not before ceding her claims to Philip, Duke of Orl√©ans. Amadeus and Louis sent an embassy to Pope Clement VI, seeking his support against Joan and Philip. In 1345 Philip signed a treaty relinquishing his claims in return for an annual stipend of 5,000 livres tournois. The treaty was finalised at Paris and ratified at Chamb√©ry on 25 February 1346.Cox, 55‚Äì56. The royal treasury records Philip's receipt of the first payment on 19 November. President of the council of Savoy In 1347‚Äì48 Amadeus spent a long stay at the Avignonese curia of Clement VI, who was then concerned with settling disputes in the Piedmont and Lombardy.Cox, 68. On 4 January 1348 the count of Savoy came of age and the regency ended, although it continued in practice, as Amadeus VI was only fourteen years old. Later that year the lord of Vaud died and Amadeus III was left as sole regent, overseeing the \\"council of Savoy\\" or \\"count's council\\", as the former regency council was then known.Cox, 76‚Äì77. The Savoyard historians Jehan Servion and Jean Cabaret d'Oronville record that the council elected one of its members, Guillaume de la Baume, to co-rule with the count of Geneva, who was still not trusted by the Savoyards. Guillaume's election may have been due to French influence. In 1348, Alamand de Saint-Jeoire, the Bishop of Geneva, placed two of his castles under the protection of the Dauphin Charles, future king of France, in an effort to stem the influence of the counts both of Geneva and of Savoy. Amadeus III's officials took reprisals against the diocese, bringing down the condemnation of Clement VI, who nonetheless maintained his good relations with the counts. Amadeus was not deterred. He seized the two castles and removed the Dauphin's banners, replacing them with his own. On 8 October 1349 an alliance was sealed at Ciri√© between Amadeus III of Geneva, Amadeus VI of Savoy, Galeazzo II of Milan, and James of Piedmont. This alliance was sealed by the marriage of the count of Savoy's sister Bianca to Galeazzo on 28 September 1350, which was followed by the creation of the Order of the Black Swan, of which Amadeus of Geneva was named one of the three grans seignours (along with the count of Savoy and Galeazzo).Cox, 78‚Äì79. By 9 July 1351, Amadeus had fallen out with the rest of the council of Savoy and its anti- French policy. On that day, presiding over a meeting of the council at Saint- Genix, he ordered that his opposition to hearing some ambassadors from Edward III of England be recorded.Cox, 80. Edward III was then at war with France, the so-called Edwardian War. Amadeus and the Savoyard chancellor, Georges de Solerio, were largely responsible for the subsequent treaty signed with France on 27 October at Avignon. In 1351 the peasantry of the Valais rebelled against the lordship of the Bishop of Sion, then Guichard Tavel, of Genevan family and Savoyard allegiance.For the causes and background of the rebellion, cf. Cox, 88‚Äì91. On 7 January 1352 the rebels were excommunicated by Clement VI. In March an army, led by Amadeus of Savoy, Amadeus of Geneva, John II of Montferrat, and Peter IV of Gruy√®re was gathering at Saint-Maurice to crush the rebels. The inhabitants of the Valais were so intimidated, however, that they surrendered without a fight.Cox, 91‚Äì92. Disputes with Savoy In May 1352 Amadeus VI of Savoy nullified the treaty of Avignon negotiated by Amadeus III, maligning (probably without basis) the count of Geneva's integrity. In July Amadeus formally withdrew from the council of Savoy and challenged the lords of La Baume, whom he considered his archenemies at the Savoyard court, to war.Cox, 94. In 1355, after the conclusion of a war between the count of Savoy and the Dauphin Charles, Amadeus III refused to do homage to his cousin for those fiefs he held of the Dauphin. Amadeus also interfered with the count of Savoy's attempts to militarily occupy the barony of Faucigny that year, although he did not actively intervene.Cox, 107‚Äì08. Despite his attempts he was unable to induce John II of France to intervene in the Faucignerans' favour.Cox, 112. On 20 July in the Franciscan monastery at Geneva, Amadeus III did homage to his former ward the count of Savoy.Cox, 114. The issues in dispute had by this time been brought before the Emperor Charles IV, the overlord of the entire region. On 21 August he ordered the count of Savoy not to interfere in the Faucigny or the County of Geneva and put both under his direct protection pending an investigation.Cox, 121. The Palais de l'Isle in Annecy, once the seat of the count of Geneva, was a mint under Amadeus III. In May 1358 the Emperor exempted Amadeus III of the jurisdiction of Savoy and granted him the right to appeal to the Emperor all decisions by any other court, whether French or Savoyard. Amadeus, but not his successors, was granted the right to coin money (at the Palais de l'Isle), legitimise bastards, and create notaries.Cox, 129‚Äì31. The bishop of Geneva immediately opposed the count's right of coinage to the pope. Amadeus of Savoy ordered Amadeus III to renew his oath of homage, but the latter instead asked for the arbitration of Jean de Bertrand, the Archbishop of Tarentaise. On 2 August the archbishop ruled that Amadeus had the right to mint coins, but not to refuse to renew the oath of homage nor to appeal outside of the courts of the count of Savoy. The count of Geneva refused to accept the result, accusing the archbishop of an \\"unjust and iniquitous\\" verdict and vowing to appeal to the Emperor personally (viva voce). The two counts came to terms by 21 December. Amadeus III agreed to render homage at Geneva for his fiefs Duingt, Annecy, La Roche, Clermont, Th√¥nes, Gruffy, Arlod, Ch√¢tel, La B√¢tie, and Gaillard, and for the \\"sub-fiefs\\" of his own vassals Thomas de Menthon, Guillaume de Compey, and Aymon de Pontverre. In return Amadeus VI declared the archiepiscopal decision void. Order of the Collar and the crusade In January 1364 Amadeus III was named the second knight of the newly founded Order of the Collar.The date comes from Cox, 180‚Äì81, who cites Jean Servion as the only source for the original membership of the order. While the formation of the Order was connected with the launch of Amadeus VI's crusade, Amadeus III did not accompany the crusaders. He sent his eldest son, Aymon III, in his place, and he himself died only months after the crusaders departed, which suggests that he was in poor health at the time.Cox, 184 and 207‚Äì08. Family In 1334 Amadeus married Mathilde or Mahaut d'Auvergne, also called \\"de Boulogne\\", with whom he had numerous offspring, four of whom were counts of Geneva in succession: *Aymon III, successor as Count of Geneva *Amadeus IV, succeeded his brother as Count of Geneva *John, succeeded his brother as Count of Geneva *Peter, succeeded his brother as Count of Geneva *Robert, later the Antipope Clement VII, succeeded his brother as Count of Geneva *Mary, who married first (1361) Jean II de Chalon-Arlay (died 1362), then (1366) Humbert VII de Thoire, to whose son, Humbert VIII de Thoire (died 1400), the county of Geneva passed after the death of Robert *Joan (died 1389), married (1358) Raymond V of Baux, Prince of Orange *Blanche (died 1420), lady of Frontenay, married (1363) Hugh II of Chalon-Arlay *Catherine (died 1407), married (1380) Amadeo, Prince of Achaea *Yolanda, married Aimery VI of Narbonne *Agnes, became a nun *Louise, married Guillaume III le Sage, lord of Saint-Georges Notes Category:1311 births Category:1367 deaths Category:Counts of Geneva Category:Regents of Savoy Category:House of Geneva ","title":"Amadeus III of Geneva"},{"id":"24721694","text":"Power of 2 is a book written by bestselling author Rodd Wagner and Gallup World Poll leader Dr. Gale Muller. It describes the authors‚Äô five years of research on collaboration and partnerships. The book is a mixture of advice to the reader, stories of prominent partnerships, and discoveries from various disciplines such as primatology, neuroscience, game theory, and behavioral economics. Content Power of 2 is organized into eight main chapters, each detailing one of the elements of partnership identified by the authors‚Äô research. The eight elements are complementary strengths, a common mission, fairness, trust, acceptance, forgiveness, communicating, and unselfishness. These elements are illustrated through short stories about famous partnerships such as those between Karl Malone and John Stockton, Bill Hewlett and David Packard, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, and James Watson and Francis Crick. Power of 2 is one of several books ‚Äì along with bestsellers Now, Discover Your Strengths and StrengthsFinder 2.0 ‚Äì based on Gallup‚Äôs evidence that people flourish best when using their inherent talents. After summarizing studies indicating people generally overestimate their abilities where they are weak and underestimate them when they are strong, the authors advise: ‚ÄúSo admit it: You stink at some things. You have blind spots, weaknesses, areas in which others seem to perform effortlessly while you struggle just to be average. You are also overly modest about your strengths. What seems to be no big deal to you is difficult for others. Your strengths are stronger and your weaknesses weaker than you realize. You need help. You are also precisely the help someone else needs.‚Äù This incompleteness of the individual, they argue, is one of the primary reasons for partnerships. The trust chapter of the book makes use of the numerous studies of the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma (what Wagner and Muller prefer to call ‚Äúthe partner‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù). Although the classic form of the famous trust game gives more incentives to defect than to cooperate, Power of 2 derives lessons from Robert Axelrod‚Äôs computer tournaments showing that the optimal strategy is to start friendly, then reciprocate what the other person does. A wise collaborator is simultaneously eager to cooperate, but willing to stand up for himself, they conclude. The chapter on unselfishness tells the story of the partnership between Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, two of the fathers of behavioral economics and highly successful collaborators themselves until Tversky's untimely death from skin cancer. Power of 2 includes two supplemental chapters for managers and business leaders. Managers who are perceived as being more ‚Äúpartner‚Äù than ‚Äúboss‚Äù have substantially more engaged workgroups, according to the book. The authors caution executives that many companies that claim to want collaboration between groups in fact create incentives for two groups to compete with each other.

At the time of its founding, the existence of black swans was unknown to Europeans. The order was originally composed of fourteen knights. The requirements of membership were the possession of a charger and a palfrey, and the ability to serve at one's own expense for one week whenever required. The Order did collect dues (at least from noblemen, riches hommes) for purposes estreordinaire (extraordinary) according to rank (puissance): eight √©cus from a knight banneret, four from what they called a chivallier simple, and one from any squire. Annually on Saint Andrew's Day the knights assembled and approved expenditures. In the meantime, the monies were stored in several religious establishments. The Order's emblem was a black swan with red beak and feet on a white field, and members (compaignons) were required to display it, usually on their shields. Members swore an oath to defend each other, even against relatives beyond the degree of first cousin, and to submit all disputes between themselves to the judgement of the membership. Any knight who refused to abide by the arbitration of the others was expelled and his former comrades joined in arms against him.

All species have leathery, entire or toothed leaves in rosettes, directly from the underground rootstock, and one or few flower heads sit at the top of the stems that carry few bracts. These have a whorl of white to mauve ray florets surrounding yellow disc florets in the centre. In general, flowering only occurs after the vegetation has burned down. The six species currently assigned to Mairia are endemic to the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. Some of the species are called fire daisy in English and vuuraster in Afrikaans.  Description  Mairia consists of species which store their reserves in their succulent brown underground roots (so-called geophytes). They have evergreen, broad to narrow, oval, elliptic or line- shaped, leathery, often more or less succulent leaves, narrowed at their base in to a leaf stalk that may be broadly winged, with an entire margin, slightly lobed, with few teeth or with regular rounded or pointy teeth. The leaves have one to five main veins, and the surface is very to lightly woolly or hairless, and may or may not carry glands. All leaves grow in a rosette directly from the woody rootstock in the ground. From the rootstock also develop one or few initially woolly hairy, mostly dark reddish inforescence stems (or scapes) with one to eight small bracts. These are mostly unbranched but may have up to eight branches in the upper half. Each of these are topped by one or few flower heads, with an involucre of bracts surrounding a flat to slightly concave common base, with clear pits where the ovary attach and without bracts at the foot of the individual florets. The involucre is bell- or cup-shaped or somewhat narrower at the rim. It consists of three, four or up to six whorls of bracts that are overlapping and mostly increase in size further in. On the edge of the common base grows one whorl of white to mauve-coloured florets. Their corollas consist of a short tube at the base topped by a long, flat, ribbon-like ligule with four or sometimes up to seven veins. In the center of the tube is a forked style that has its receptive areas along the margin which do not meet at the tip, where there is a triangular appendage. The shaft of the style is mostly surrounded by five infertile stamens but these may be absent. Many yellow, funnel-shapped, star-symmetrical disc florets occupy the center of the flower head, often carry soft glands and carry five triangular lobes with a resin duct along the edge. The disc florets contain both ovaries topped by a forked style and five fertile anthers that form a tube around the style shaft. These anthers have triangular appendages at their tip, a blunt basis with or with a very short tail-like appendage. The pale to dark brown, one-seeded, dry, indehiscent fruits (or cypselae) of both ray and disc florets are cylinder-shaped or somewhat flattened, carry apparently two, or four to seven narrow, mostly contrasting ribs, and are covered by shiny, yellow glands and deeply divided, silvery or golden twin hairs on a further unadorned surface. They carry at their tip the modified calyx called pappus that is yellowish white, persistent, and arranged in two whorls. The outer whorl consists of free, up to 3 mm (0.012 in) long, barbed or feathery bristles and an inner whorl of feathery bristles of up to 9 mm (0.36 in) long, that are merged into a ring at the base. It has eighteen homologous sets of chromosomes (2n= 36).  Taxonomy  The earliest known description of a species of fire daisy was by Carl Peter Thunberg, a Swedish naturalist who is sometimes referred to as \\"the father of South African botany\\". He named it Arnica crenata (now Mairia crenata). In 1833, Nees von Esenbeck erected a new genus Mairia, and took M. crenata as its type species. The genus was accepted by many later authors such as Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1836. William Henry Harvey in 1865 wrongly spelled the name as Mairea and extended the number of species to ten. The genus was also recognised by George Bentham in 1873, Hoffmann in 1889, and Edwin Percy Phillips in 1959. Robert Allen Dyer also spelled the name wrongly as Mairea in 1975. K√•re Bremer in 1994 included fourteen species and thought that Mairia should be included in his Amellus group (subtribe Asterinae). Guy L. Nesom and Harold E. Robinson in 2007 placed it in the primarily South-American subtribe Hinterhuberinae of the tribe Astereae. Close examination of the species assigned to Mairia at that time, led J√ºrke Grau in 1971, and Nesom in 1994 to reassign the many species without leaf rosettes. This left Mairia with only three species with leaf rosettes: M. crenata, M. coriacea and M. hirsuta. They considered the species they reassigned to Gymnostephium and Zyrphelis as more related to Amellus, Chrysocoma, Felicia and Polyarrhena, than to the species they retained in Mairia. This reassignment was confirmed by a comparison of homologenous genes in 2009. Later two newly distinguished taxa were included in the genus, and one species, M. burchellii that was originally described by De Candolle, but had been reassigned to Zyrphelis by Harvey, was reinstated in Mairia by Ulrike Zinnecker-Wiegand in 1990. In 2011, Zinnecker-Wiegand, distinguished M. petiolata as well as M. hirsuta subsp. robusta. The latter was raised to species level by John Manning and Peter Goldblatt in 2012, so creating M. robusta. In 2016, Manning considered Cineraria purpurata synonymous to Mairia hirsuta, and consequently proposed the combination Mairia purpurata. The genus was named in honour of Louis Maire, half of the South African collecting team of Mund and Maire.

It shows that Mairia likely diverges early in the history of this tribe. Since only one species of Mairia was included in this study, further research may change insights. The genus Zyrphelis to which the majority of species formerly included in Mairia have been reassigned, is much more related to Felicia and Chrysocoma than to the species that have been retained in Mairia. The following relationship tree represents current insights.  Reassigned species  The species that were originally described as, or moved to Mairia, which since have been reassigned include the following: * Mairia corymbosa = Gymnostephium papposum * Mairia decumbens = Aster decumbens * Mairia ecklonis = Zyrphelis ecklonis * Mairia felicioides = Felicia ovata * Mairia foliosa = Zyrphelis foliosa * Mairia lasiocarpa = Zyrphelis lasiocarpa * Mairia microcephala = Zyrphelis microcephala * Mairia montana = Zyrphelis montana * Mairia perezioides = Zyrphelis perezioides * Mairia taxifolia = Zyrphelis taxifolia  Distribution and ecology  Mairia coriacea, flowering in a burnt veldThe six species of fire daisy are endemic to the southern mountains of the Western Cape province and the western end of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. M. burchellii occurs from Piketberg and Ceres in the north, to the southern Cape Peninsula and the Hottentots Holland Mountains in the south, and eastwards to Bredasdorp. M. coriacea may be found between the southern part of the Cape Peninsula in the west, and the Hottentots Holland Mountains, following the coast past Cape Agulhas to the mouth of the Breede River at Witsand in the east. M. crenata has the largest distribution of any species of Mairia. It has an isolated population on Table Mountain. From Du Toitskloof Pass and the Hottentots Holland Mountains in the west, it can be found along the length of the Riviersonderend Mountains, the Langeberg, the Outeniqua Mountains and Tsitsikamma Mountains all the way to the Kouga Mountains on the eastern end. M. hirsuta has a rather limited distribution from near Swellendam to Suurbraak in the Langeberg, and in the isolated range of Warmwaterberg in the Little Karoo to the north. Only a single population of M. petiolata is known, just north of Swellendam in the Langeberg. M. robusta grows from Bainskloof in the north, along Stellenbosch Mountain and Hottentots Holland Mountains to the southern coast near the Kogelberg. Mairia only flowers after a fire has burnt the overhead vegetation.  Conservation  The continued survival of four species is considered of least concern: M. burchellii, M. coriacea, M. crenata and M. robusta, M. hirsuta is rare, and M. petiolata is critically rare.

It is a shrub producing a fleshy, woolly stem usually over a meter in height, often approaching two meters. Leaves occur in tufts at the ends of the stem branches. They are up to 15 centimeters long, oblong in shape, and sometimes very shallowly lobed. They are woolly when new but lose their hairs and become shiny green with age. The inflorescence is a large array of up to 35 flower heads. Each head has a cylindrical base under a centimeter long and contains 9 to 12 light lavender or pinkish flowers. Each flower is a ray floret with an erect tube and a strap-shaped ligule with a toothed tip. The ligule is just under a centimeter long. The fruit is a cylindrical, ribbed achene with a white pappus.

Based in London, with a production facility in Co. Galway, Ireland, the organisation has a Europe-wide scope. The institute's stated objectives are among others: * To promote academic achievement, training and professionalism within the transport and logistics industry. * To monitor and improve standards through ongoing research and communications programs. * To award industry members for significant achievements and contributions in the development of transport solutions. Its principal activity has been the distribution of awards to companies, nominally those with innovative transport products and services. The companies nominate themselves or others for these awards, and after a period of independent research, a short list is compiled naming the winners. A Lifetime Achievement award is also given to a person who distinguishes themselves throughout their career and achievements. Not all categories are filled from year to year due to this application process. History Established in 1977, The Institute of Transport Management, also known as ITM, was the first to award companies and individuals for their effort in the transport industry in Europe. SME's, multinationals and other supporting industries have received numerous awards since the Institutes establishment. Through the decades and as a result of incredible growth in the industry, the Institute of Transport Management had increased its award categories. In 2001, Dealers Choice Award was introduced to reflect the opinions of the automotive industry through their interaction with products and customers. Those taking part in the nominations are not allowed to vote for their own company and must be nominated by other individuals. In May 2014, the institute announced that it is restructuring the company by moving its headquarters to London and opening a production facility in Ireland. The process started in 2013 where the Institute focused on updating their database and fostering new links around the world so that they are up to date on the most current research prior to the 2014 re-launch. The re-branding of the companies website from ITMawards to ITM World is an enlargement strategy employed to give the institute a worldwide presence in the evolving transport industry and revive the long-standing achievement of the international awards body. By October 2014, ITM hoped to relaunch its exclusive online publication, The Transport Journal. The quarterly research journal reports into all the industry sectors and looks at future innovations in the transport industries. Categories * Aviation * Automotive * Maritime * Rail Transport * Supporting Industries * Logistics * IT and Communications * Environmental * Aftermarket * Dealers Choice Nomination Process * Companies, organisations and individuals that meet the awards criteria under each respective category are invited to participate in the nomination process. * Selected companies submit any additional statements or documents that they feel may be important to the nomination process. * Pre-assessment process of entries is undertaken by Institutes research team against strict quality criteria. * Nominees for each category are notified and published on the ITM awards site. * The chosen members of the Award committee, which is made up of Institutes members, approves nominations and scores them according to category criteria. * Category winners and the overall winners are notified and announced to the Transport Media. Some of the Past Winners * Swissport, Global Aviation Ground Services Company 2012 * Evolution-Time Critical, Emergency Logistics Specialist of the Year, 2012 * GEFCO, European Logistics Company 2012 and UK Automotive Logistics Company 2012 * Jaama Ltd, Fleet Software Company of the Year 2012 * GMAC, Best Auto Finance Company 2012 * Autologic Diagnostic Ltd.

Life Conte completed his studies in classical philology at the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa, where he was influenced by scholars such as Antonio La Penna, Sebastiano Timpanaro and . In particular with the first of these, he first had a fruitful period of collaboration, but then broke contact abruptly in an exchange of letters. Conte also went abroad to study in Munich with Friedrich Klingner and in Paris. At the age of 30, he was made professor of Latin Literature at the University of Siena, later at the University of Pisa and finally, in 2001, at the Scuola Normale Superiore. He enjoys high esteem outside Italy, in particular in the Anglo-Saxon world where he has been invited as guest professor to Oxford, Cambridge, Princeton, Berkeley, and Stanford. In 2007, he ran for the office of director of the Scuola Normale Superiore, but was second to the preceding director Salvatore Settis, who received his third mandate in succession. In 2014 he was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. Work Conte confines his work basically to Latin literature, mainly to the poetry of the late republic, the Augustan period, and the early empire (Virgil, Lucan, Catullus, the elegiacs, Ovid, Lucretius), but also works on prose writers such as Pliny the Elder and on the novel of Petronius. Conte's approach to Latin literature is characterized by a combination of traditional philology and the innovations of literary theory of the 1970s, in particular structuralism. In his most successful pieces of work, for the most part articles which he later put together to form thematic volumes, Conte breaks with Croce‚Äôs historicism and develops the concept of a literary system and of genre based on codes. Conte's approach has been picked up in the last thirty years in particular in the Anglo-Saxon world and successfully elaborated in combination with the theory of intertextuality. Conte has just published a new Teubner edition of Virgil's Aeneid and continues working, together with a group of researchers and students, on a commentary to go with it, on a commentary on the Satyrica of Petronius and on allegory as a literary and hermeneutical form. Conte is co- founder and director of the periodical Materiali e discussioni per l'analisi dei testi classici as well as a regular member of the Accademia Nazionale Virgiliana in Mantua. Amongst his students are Alessandro Schiesaro, Alessandro Barchiesi, Rolando Ferri, Sergio Casali.

Cuvier, Dict. Sci. Nat. 34: 94. 1825. Natural History White Lettuce is firmly identified with Common lettuce, Lactuca sativa. Lactuca sativa has its inceptions in the Middle East. Egyptian divider paintings of Min, the divine force of fruitfulness, portray lettuce in development in around 2700 B.C. The erect plant like present day romaine, with a thick stem and smooth sap had sexual meanings. Min devoured lettuce as a consecrated nourishment for sexual stamina, and conventional Egyptians utilized the oil of the wild seeds for medication, cooking, and preservation . After some time, the Egyptians reared their wild-type lettuce to have leaves that were not so much harsh but rather more attractive. The developed plants were as yet tall and upstanding, with discrete leaves instead of heads. The Greeks figured out how to develop lettuce from the Egyptians. They utilized it restoratively as a narcotic and served it as a plate of mixed greens toward the start of dinners to help with assimilation. They likewise kept on developing it for more delectable leaves. In Greek folklore, Aphrodite's sweetheart Adonis was murdered in a bed of lettuce by a pig sent differently by Artemis, who was desirous of his chasing ability, or by Persephone, who was jealous of his fondness for Aphrodite, or by Ares, who was envious of Aphrodite. Whoever the prompting god was, lettuce was related with male feebleness and demise, prompting its introduction at memorial services. The Greeks passed their lettuce-developing information on to the Romans, who named the plant \\"lactuca,\\" signifying \\"milk,\\" for its white sap. In time, \\"lactuca\\" turned into the English word \\"lettuce,\\" while the Roman name was safeguarded in the family name for lettuce and its relatives. ; SpeciesFlann, C (ed) 2009+ Global Compositae Checklist The Plant List search for NabalusBiota of North America Program 2013 county distribution maps * Nabalus acerifolius - Japan * Nabalus alatus - AK BC ALB WA OR IDMT * Nabalus albus - SAS MAN ONT QUE United States (Great Lakes, Northeast, Appalachians) * Nabalus altissimus MAN ONT QUE NB NS United States (Northeast, Southeast, South-central) * Nabalus angustilobus - Sichuan * Nabalus asper - United States (Great Plains, Mississippi Valley) * Nabalus barbatus - TX OK AR LA KY TN MS AL GA * Nabalus boottii - NY VT NH ME * Nabalus crepidineus - MN IA MO AR TN KY IL IN WI MI OH WV PA NY * Nabalus faberi (Hemsl.)

Brixey attended both the Kansas City Art Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1980s to pursue a hybridized form of artmaking that employs engineering tools to create ephemeral and large-scale works. Since 1990, he has served as a visiting artist, faculty member, and chair of a number of North American arts institutions, including the Cranbrook Academy of Art, University of Washington, and Canadian Foundation for Innovation. In 2013, he became Dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts at York University, in Toronto, Ontario. From 2017 to 2019, he served as Dean of Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts, the Special Assistant to the Provost for the School of the Arts in Qatar, and both a professor of VCUarts and an affiliate professor of the VCU College of Engineering. Early life Shawn Brixey was born in Springfield, Missouri, the son of two professional artists. His father was an actor on Broadway in the interwar years; his mother was a symphony cellist. While Brixey was growing up, his parents transitioned into the film and broadcast industries, as well as Madison Avenue advertising. As a result of early exposure to the arts and telecommunications, Brixey adopted an unorthodox attitude toward artmaking during his years spent in higher education. In the 1980s, he attended the Kansas City Art Institute. In a 2016 TEDx talk, Brixey claimed that institute once bussed himself and other classmates 300 miles out to western Kansas as a supposed solution to student boredom and lack of focus. He says he and others were dropped off individually in 10-mile increments and given the instruction to \\"make a perfect line\\" or \\"make a perfect moment.\\" The work he allegedly created was a compass fabricated out of magnetized wheat chaff placed in a puddle. During his undergraduate years, Brixey worked with famed sculptor Dale Eldred. He graduated from KCAI as a bachelor of fine arts in sculpture in 1985. Career Brixey attended the graduate program at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1986 to 1988; he is described by MIT as an \\"environmental artist.\\" Over the next decade, he worked to build similar \\"new media\\" programs at the universities of Kentucky and Washington, before joining the faculty of University of California, Berkeley as the Founding Director of the New Media Program. He rejoined the faculty at the University of Washington to co-found the University of Washington's Center for Digital Arts and Experimental Media (DXARTS) program with composer Richard Karpen in 2001. In 2008, Brixey was selected to be the University of Washington's Floyd and Delores Jones Endowed Chair in the Arts. In 2013, Brixey became Dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts at York University. In 2017, Virginia Commonwealth University announced that Brixey was named the new dean of VCU School of the Arts, following the tenure of former dean Joseph H. Seipel. In August 2019, he resigned from his administrative role, while remaining a tenured faculty member at VCU. Art As an artist, Brixey creates work that utilizes highly complex scientific technology and synthetic materials. His work rarely takes permanent shape as traditional sculpture or photographs, instead existing as phenomena that are triggered by machines or natural process. His installation Alchymeia takes the form of atomic crystals, generated from the base of a human hormone. One iteration of this work proposed using the urine of athletes as the source of the hormones. Other projects utilize high-powered lights, vacuum chambers, microscopes, polarized projectors, and lasers.

Saby Kamalich, Narciso Busquets, Sara Garc√≠a, Eleazar Garc√≠a, and Cornelio Reyna also star. The supporting cast includes Enriqueta Jim√©nez and Alejandro Reyna, among others. Flor Silvestre appears in a special musical performance. Valente Quintero was the second-highest grossing film of 1973 in Mexico City. Plot In the contemporary era (circa 1973), two foreign tourists make a stop at the provincial town of Perales. Two small memorials surrounded by pebbles in a corner of a street attract their attention. On the meantime, two elderly veterans of the Mexican Revolution, Chelelo and Cornelio, come out from a nearby building to receive them. They explain to the tourists about the memorials and to whom are they in memory of. Chelelo then recounts the story of two revolutionary friends, Sub-lieutenant Valente Quintero and Major Atanasio Pizarro, who are fighting a battle in one of Perales' residential streets. Valente is severely injured when he is shot in front of the late General Gumersindo Carrillo's house where his widow, do√±a Elvira Pe√±a, his daughter, Leonor Carrillo, and their housemaid, Carmen, reside. Leonor witnesses when Valente is shot and is decided to go out and help him, against her mother's wishes. Leonor then tells her mother that she is returning a favor that could have been made to her father, who helplessly died while bleeding in the midst of a forest. Leonor therefore runs across the street to get the town's drunkard physician, Doctor Pl√°cido. Elvira, Carmen, and Leonor carry Valente into the house and lay him in a bed. Valente stays ill in bed for several days and his friend Atanasio later receives word about his survival. Atanasio falls in love with the elegant and sophisticated Leonor and admires the conservative and sharp-tongued matron Elvira. Valente and Leonor also start a romantic relationship, which leads them to marriage. Atanasio, who is now a rich and alcoholic landowner, duels Valente for the love of Leonor on the night of their honeymoon. The conflict ends with both Valente and Atanasio being killed by one another.

Over the years, it was reduced in size. It is a protected lake, with fishing banned.  History  The beautiful lake in front of the Temple of the Tooth was formerly a stretch of paddy fields known as Tigolwela. It was converted to a lake by King Sri Wickrama Rajasinha in 1807. As there had been a beautiful pond named 'Kiri-muhuda' (a 'sea of milk') in the middle of the Tigolwela, the lake constructed subsequently too was named, 'Kiri-muhuda'. Deveda Moolacharya is considered the architect of the Kandy Lake. The king first built a dam across the paddy fields, starting from the Pattiruppuwa (Octogen) side, where the steps leading into the lake by the Mahamaluwa (Esplanade) are still visible, stretching across to the Poya-maluwa. The dam, upon which a roadway was constructed, allowed the king to go across to the Malwatte Vihare. According to D‚ÄôOyley, the dam was constructed between 1810‚Äì1812. Small artificial island There are numerous local legends and folklore regarding the lake. One such is that the small island at its center was used by the king's harem for bathing and was connected to the palace by secret tunnel.  Description  The extent of Kandy Lake is 6,544 sq. meters. The circumference is 3.21 km. The highest depth is 18.5 meters. The parapet wall giving the appearance of a cloud, is popularly called Walakulu Bemma and measures 633.82 meters. The building located at the center of the lake, together with some ancient ruins, was known as Diyatilaka Mandapaya in the past. It is believed that the Kings used this pavilion for relaxation. The Kandy Lake offers a place for a stroll or a jog. The shady path surrounding the lake provides a view of the hills and the town. The Malwatte temple, one of the two head temples of the Siyam Nikaya sect of Theravada Buddhism, is also located overlooking the lake.  Jayatilleke Mandapaya  Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe built a dam for the purpose of reaching the opposite side of the lake. The king removed the soil from both the palace end and the Malwatte Vihare end, leaving an island behind. At first this island was used as the Royal Summer House for the Queen and the ladies of the court to relax. The British later used it as an ammunition store and added a fortress-style parapet around its perimeter.  Walakula Bamma  The lake is surrounded by a wall called Walakulu Bamma () or Clouds Wall, which was built to increase the beauty of the Kandy Lake. It extends around half of the lake and has taken one skilled architect to build it. Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe was unable to complete the wall before the city was captured by the British and he was forced to relinquish the Kandian kingdom. The Walakulu Bamma still lies unfinished. The triangular shaped holes in the wall were used in the past for lighting oil lamps on festival days.  Ulpange  Ulpange or Queens Bathing Pavilion is situated partly in the waters of the Kandy Lake. The wives and concubines of Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe used the pavilion when bathing in the lake. After the British captured the city they added another storey and used the building as a library. It is currently used as a police post.  Facts about the lake  Queen's bath * Spill level above: 1740 M.L.S * Capacity: 704 acre-feet * Perimeter of the tank: * Maximum depth: * Length of the decorative wall: * Catchment area: 1.045 Q.M.I There are a variety of different trees planted around the lake including Nuga trees, palm trees, fruit trees, Sal trees and Mara trees. Some of the trees are about 74 years old. The trees are now maintained by the Municipal Council of Kandy. There are a number of bird species found on the lake, including Indian cormorant, white egret crane, wood stork and pelican.  Pollution  Pollution of the lake is a serious problem. The government and the surrounding schools are trying to decrease the problem by putting signs and operating environmental societies. Until 1960 the Kandy water board used the lake to distribute water to the surrounding areas. They stopped pumping water from the lake because of the increase in pollution.

Cn. n. Lentulus Maluginensis (died AD 23) was a Roman statesman, who flourished during the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius. He was flamen dialis, and consul suffectus in AD 10. Descent Descended from the patrician Cornelia gens, Cornelius' father and grandfather were both named Gnaeus, and they belonged to the family of the Cornelii Lentuli, which first appears in Roman history during the fourth century BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 728, 729 (\\"Lentulus\\").Fasti Capitolini, . Their relationship to other prominent members of the family is not immediately apparent. The surname Maluginensis was borne by the most ancient branch of the Cornelii, but had long since vanished from use; in Imperial times old cognomina were frequently revived.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 909 (\\"Maluginensis\\"). Career Cornelius' chief notability is for having been appointed flamen dialis, the high priest of Jupiter, at the direction of Augustus, after the position had been vacant for an unusually long period. The precise date of his appointment is uncertain; Cassius Dio places it about 11 BC, which is accepted by many modern scholars.Cassius Dio, liv. 36. But Tacitus states that he was appointed seventy-two years after the suicide of Lucius Cornelius Merula, the previous holder of the priesthood, in 87 BC.Tacitus, Annales, iii. 58. In AD 10, Cornelius and Quintus Junius Blaesus, were appointed consul suffectus in the place of Publius Cornelius Dolabella and Gaius Junius Silanus. Cornelius and Blaesus served from the kalends of July to the end of the year.Fasti Arvalium, ; 1991, 306, 307.Fasti Antiates, , 6639; . Twelve years later, Cornelius sought to be appointed governor of Asia for AD 22. Such an appointment would have been typical for a consular such as Cornelius. However, the emperor Tiberius asserted that the religious duties and obligations of the flamen dialis precluded his leaving Italy, and thus Cornelius was denied the governorship. He died in AD 23, and his son, also named Servius, was appointed flamen dialis in his place.Tacitus, Annales, iii. 58, 71.

Accessed October 20, 2009. was an American physicist and astronomer who made major contributions to the scientific and operational success of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope (HST). He joined the HST Project at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1981, and was head of the Hubble Missions Office at his death.Baltimore Sun, October 15, 2009. \\"Rodger Doxsey, one of space telescope team's first leaders, dies at 62\\", Of Doxsey, STScI Director Matt Mountain said, \\"Rodger was the heart and soul of Hubble here at the Institute.... He ... knew everything about the space telescope, from the smallest anomaly to the breadth of the extraordinary science delivered by the telescope he had worked with for over 28 years.\\" Career at MIT Dr. Doxsey was born in Schenectady, New York, raised in Cleveland Heights, Ohio and earned his Ph.D. in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After his doctorate, he worked at MIT on the third NASA Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS 3), an X-ray astronomy mission, and then on the first High Energy Astronomy Observatory (HEAO 1), which was launched in August 1977. Work at STScI The Institute's first director, Riccardo Giacconi, hired Doxsey nine years before the HST launch in 1990, to be the mission operations scientist. During the following years he was responsible for mission science specifications and requirements, data calibration, operational planning and scheduling, as well as the actual day-to-day commanding of the observatory. Doxsey worked on the development of new, state-of-the-art instruments for HST with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, which contributed to the enormous advance made in Hubble's scientific capabilities after launch, by replacing, in the course of several Space Shuttle visits from 1993 to May 2009, the original suite of instruments which had been specified and designed on the basis of technology that was many years old by the time HST finally became operational. Doxsey was also responsible for hiring many of the STScI's staff. Awards and honors Among Doxsey's many awards and honors, especially notable are: *1991: Awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest honor the Agency can give a nongovernmental employee.

In 1338, together with cousin Moroyasu, he went to fight against Southern Court forces in Aonohara, Mino Province, to help contain Kitabatake Akiie, who was threatening Kyoto. The next year he was made Kant≈ç shitsuji, counsellor to Ashikaga Yoshiakira, holding the post until 1944.Kokushi Daijiten (1979:486‚Äì487) He proved successful in this role against both the pro-Ashikaga Tadayoshi Uesugi clan and against Hitachi Province's Kitabatake Chikafusa, who was the main military force behind the Southern court. He defeated Chikafusa first in December 1341 and then two years later, finally driving him out of Kant≈ç. He was concurrently also shugo of Musashi Province from 1341 to 1344. He was then ordered to return to Kyoto, and in 1347 sent to Ise Province as shugo, in which role he fought several battles. In 1349 Takauji sent his son Motouji to the Kant≈ç to take the place of his other son Yoshiakira, whom he wanted in Kyoto, stabilize the area and protect his interests there.Papinot (1972:36) Since Motouji was then just a child, real power was in the hands of the two shitsuji Uesugi Noriaki and Morofuyu himself, men who were politically enemies. In 1350, during the so-called Kann≈ç disturbance, a civil war that saw the two Ashikaga brothers fight each other, the differences between the two deepened past the breaking point. He remained with Takauji, while Noriaki defected and went with Tadayoshi. In 1351 he left Motouji in Kamakura to attack Noriaki. Defeated and pursued by his forces, he committed seppuku at in Kai Province.

The first to cross over was Louis Schwabacher, who came over with the help of his mother‚Äôs brother, Isaac Bloch of San Francisco. Louis engaged in business several places in the Southern United States and settled for a time in Mississippi. In 1858 he relocated to San Francisco. Around that time, his brothers joined him. When the main focus of the brothers' business shifted to the Pacific Northwest, Abraham Schwabacher stayed behind at the brothers' San Francisco headquarters. He married his first cousin, Sara Lehrberger Schwabacher. One Schwabacher enterprise in California was the Stockton Milling Company (Stockton, California), of which Sigmund Schwabacher was president. Walla Walla After ventures in San Francisco and in The Dalles, Oregon (where Sigmund worked for a relative with the surname Black, probably originally Bloch), the brothers set up a business in Walla Walla, Washington, in 1860. At that time, Walla Walla was a base for the Orofino Creek gold rush in Idaho, and was accessible only about half the year, when the untamed Columbia River was calm enough for travel; a decade later it was still a chaotic frontier town. For roughly two decades, Sigmund Schwabacher would remain the firm's resident partner in Walla Walla. He was director of the First National Bank of Walla Walla,Rochlin (2000), p. 115. (independent until it was merged into Seattle First National Bank in 1947), and helped raise funds for the Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad. (Despite its ambitious name, the railroad never made it out of King County, where Seattle is located., p. 110‚Äì114) The Schwabacher company also operated two grist mills in Walla Walla. In 1872, Sigmund Schwabacher also married his cousin, Rosa Schwabacher; about 10 years later, she convinced him that it was time to return to San Francisco. Louis Schwabacher worked for a while in Walla Walla; after marrying Bella Blum in 1877, he moved back to San Francisco, managing the eastern Washington stores remotely.Roth (1997) says \\"Belle Blum\\", not \\"Bella Blum\\". The Shwabachers' 1876 building in Walla Walla was described in a 19th-century account as: > ‚Ä¶the finest building north of San Francisco, its front resplendent with > massive iron columns and arches; its seven entrances each with double doors, > the outer ones being iron, the inner cedar‚Ä¶. The interior was 16 feet high, > painted white. Its six iron pillars were painted and gilded. In the > northwest corner, there was a glass space of 12x16 elevated with a fireplace > where Mr. Sigmund Schwabacher could observe and direct the activities.Quoted > in Roth (1997). She does not give the original source. In 1909, H.A. Gardner, J.M. Fitzgerald, and others bought the store, which survived until 1980 as Gardner's Department Store. Boise The Schwabachers also had a branch store in Boise, Idaho. Seattle Schwabacher's Wharf, Seattle, circa 1900 The three Schwabacher brothers' only sister, Barbetta (Babette) Schwabacher (January 3, 1836 ‚Äì January 7, 1908), married the brothers' business associate Bailey Gatzert in 1861. The couple headed in 1869 for Seattle‚Äîthen a town of barely 1,000 people‚Äîwhere Gatzert established a branch of Schwabacher Bros. & Company. Gatzert would go on to become Seattle's first (and, as of 2009, only) Jewish mayor.Lee Micklin, Jewish mayor of Seattle Bailey Gatzert is elected on August 2, 1875, HistoryLink, October 30, 1998.

Schwabacher's Hardware Co. at First and Yesler, Seattle, circa 1900 A similar view in 2007. A September 25, 1871 advertisement in the Intelligencer (predecessor of the Seattle Post- Intelligencer) boasted that the store \\"sold everything from a needle to an anchor.\\"Quoted in Roth (1997). The store established in-house brands \\"Colonial\\" and \\"Old Faithful.\\" Drawing on the company's Walla Walla experience, the store outfitted miners for the 1879‚Äì1880 Ruby Creek/Skagit River gold rush slightly north of Seattle. Schwabacher's Wharf, site of the city's first customs house and first bonded warehouse had the good fortune to be the only wharf on Seattle's Central Waterfront to survive the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. The arrival of the Portland at Schwabacher's Wharf in July 1897, with its \\"ton of gold\\", is usually counted as the start of the Yukon Gold Rush, from which the Schwabachers profited greatly as outfitters.Events from the 1890s, Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce.

Egbert docked at Schwabacher's Wharf in 1900 while preparing to transport troops to China to deal with the Boxer Rebellion While Schwabacher's Wharf survived the Great Seattle Fire, their retail store did not. Within 16 days, they had erected temporary one-story brick building at Front Street (now First Avenue) and Madison Street. In 1893, another fire burned out their hardware department, prompting new construction with the hardware department as the separate Schwabacher Hardware Company, headed by Sigmund Schwabacher, who for the rest of his life traveled frequently between San Francisco and Seattle.Rochlin (2000), p. 115‚Äì116. Upon Sigmund's death in 1900, he was succeeded at Schwabacher Hardware by his son Leopold (Leo) S. Schwabacher (December 26, 1871 ‚Äì April 6, 1930). Three years later, Leo married Edna Blum of San Francisco; they settled in Seattle.Rochlin (2000), p. 116. Another fire hit the Schwabacher Hardware Company on February 11, 1905, leading to the construction of a new and even larger store at First Avenue South and South Jackson Street. Bailey Gatzert died in 1893. He was succeeded at Schwabacher Bros. & Company in Seattle by James S. Goldsmith,Roth (1997) says \\"Godsmith\\", presumably a typo. See, for example, Alfred D.

It belongs to both the Nanguneri assembly constituency and the Tirunelveli parliamentary constituency. The village is surrounded by wetlands and paddy fields. The main occupation of the population is agriculture. In the summer, pulses are grown as a relay crop. There are three tanks to irrigate the paddy crop, and the Palayam channel of Thamirabharani irrigation system acts as a feeding channel for the tanks. Thamirabharani river flows on the eastern side of the village. History A thousand years ago there was a king (likely from the Pandya dynasty) named Kulasekara Pandian, who ruled a small territory called Manapadai veedu, in Tirunelveli. He had two daughters named Maruthavalli and Cholavalli. Oorkattu mannan, who ruled a place near Kallidaikurichi, wanted to marry both Maruthavalli and Cholavalli. Therefore, Oorkattu mannan threatened to invade Kulasekara's territory if he did not give his daughters in marriage to Oorkattu mannan. Upon learning the news, the princesses were shocked, but they refused to marry Oorkattu mannan, citing the age factor. As a result, Oorkattu mannan planned to kidnap both of the princesses. When the princesses learned Oorkattu mannan's plan, they decided to commit suicide by drowning themselves in the river Thamirabharani. By God's grace, both princess were transformed into lemons, and they reached the riverbanks of the now so-called Maruthur. Every night,a poet named Kavirayar used to meditate on the riverbanks of Maruthur. He used to take a bath in the river before he started his meditation. On a particular day doing so, he found the lemons by accident. The lemons transformed into Maruthavalli and Cholavalli. Kavirayar was shocked and asked for the reason, upon which the girls narrated. Kavirayar was amazed by the beauty of Maruthavalli and Cholavalli and expressed his desire to marry both of them. On hearing this, they were shocked. To escape from him, they told him that if Kavirayar would build a dam across the river Thamiraparani before sunrise, they would marry him. He readily accepted the condition, and began to sing a song. The rocks and stones started rolling from a nearby mountain near Vallanadu and fell into the river and formed a dam. The whole dam was constructed before sunrise. On seeing the dam, both Maruthavalli and Cholavalli were astonished and to escape from Kavirayar, both of them fell onto the dead pot and they committed suicide. Oorkattu Mannan built a temple in the memory of Maruthavalli and Cholavalli at that place where they committed suicide and he appointed Kavirayar to take care of the temple. In the memory of Maruthavalli and since the place consists mainly of Marutham lands, the place came to be known as Maruthur. Adi-Marutheeswar and Navaneetha krishnan temples At the centre of Maruthur, the Adi-Marutheeswar and Vishalakshi temple was built by Uoorkattu Pandian. The temple was renovated in 1969 by Mr P.Chithirai Pandian, fondly called \\"Chairman\\" by the people, as he was chairman of Palayamkottai Union at that time. In addition, another temple, the Navaneetha Krishnan temple, is also located in the village and is frequently visited by peoples from the nearby areas.

After beginning his career at the S√®vres Pottery, he moved to Stoke-on-Trent in 1870 to work at Mintons Ltd, where he became the leading exponent of the technique of ceramic decoration called p√¢te-sur-p√¢te. His work commanded high prices in the late Victorian period. Solon was born in Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne. After moving to England at the time of the Franco-Prussian War he lived there for the rest of his life. Family Mintons vases designed by Marc-Louis-Emmanuel Solon in the p√¢te- sur-p√¢te style, 1880 Solon married Laure, the daughter of Minton's art director, L√©on Arnoux, and the Solons raised a large family in The Villas near the Mintons factory. Their eldest son, L√©on-Victor Solon (1872‚Äì1957), joined Minton in the 1890s and became art director (1900‚Äì1909). Leon made an important contribution to art nouveau ceramics at Minton before moving to the United States. (accessed via JSTOR, subscription required) Other notable sons include Camille Solon and Albert Solon of Solon and Schemmel Tile Company. Art Despite some family resistance to his becoming an artist, he studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and with Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran.SOLON, Louis Marc Emmanuel Some of Solon's work came to the attention of the art director of the S√®vres Pottery. Solon was employed at S√®vres from 1862-70 as a ceramic artist and designer and was where he learned and began to perfect the technique of p√¢te-sur-p√¢te. His styles were derived from Classical Greece, the Renaissance, 17th- and 18th-century paintings, and Victorian postcards while his subjects often included portraits, female figures, putti (cherubs), small animals, and birds. His early work was produced under the pseudonym Miles, said to be based on his initials M L E S. A number of these earlier pieces are housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum and in the collection of the former Minton Museum. Solon moved from France to England in 1870 to flee from the Franco-Prussian War. He found employment at Mintons Ltd, and settled at N¬∫1, The Villas, Stoke-on-Trent.The Villas Mintons had a history of employing foreign artists, starting with their first Frenchman in 1848, the art director L√©on Arnoux, followed by other French artists such as the sculptor Albert- Ernest Carrier-Belleuse. While working at Mintons Solon became the leading expert in the p√¢te-sur-p√¢te technique. Mintons experienced more demand for p√¢te-sur-p√¢te ceramics than Solon could fulfill on his own so he trained a number of apprentices including Frederick Alfred Rhead and Alboin Birks. There ensued a golden age of p√¢te-sur-p√¢te in Stoke-on-Trent that stretched into the early years of the 20th century. One of Solon's vases, believed to be his largest, is on display at Osborne House. He died at Stoke-on-Trent on 23 June 1913.

The office was second in power and dignity to the King. Like many of the existing high offices at the time it had combined legislative and judicial powers and functioned primarily equivalent to that of a Prime Minister and Chief Justice, but also had duties in the government of a province. During the Kandyan period there were two Adigars, who were styled Mah√¢ Nilames (Grand Officers), the Pallegampah√™ Mah√¢ Nilam√™ and the Udagampah√™ Mah√¢ Nilam√™, the former taking precedence over the latter. History The constitution and laws derived by the earlier kings of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Dambadeniya guided the later kings of Kotte and Kandy in accordance with the Lex non scripta of the country. In most instances it is believed that these customary laws, dating from remote antiquity, to have been originated from the ancient written laws of which no records have remained. No regular records remain owing, in all probability, to the wanton destruction of literary records and libraries during the several invasions from the continent of India. One most devastating example committed by the Cholas at the beginning of the thirteenth century where the island suffered irreparable losses both from a literary and political point of view, due to the furious destruction of the invaders. In the Sinhalese Kingdom the Monarch was the absolute ruler, however the monarch was assisted in the exercise of the functions of government by the AmƒÅtya Mandalaya which was headed by the Mah√¢ Adig√¢rs, a position equivalent to that of a Prime Minister. By the Kandyan period there existed two Adigars who were styled Mah√¢ Nilames (Grand Officers), the Pallegampah√™ Mah√¢ Nilam√™ and the Udagampah√™ Mah√¢ Nilam√™, the former taking precedence over the latter, though remaining equal in power. These names were derived from the districts under the Rajakariya system, where services due from the inhabitants of these areas having been given to the two Adig√¢rs. Following the expansion of British rule into the provinces of the former Kandyan Kingdom, since 1815 the British retained the office of Adigar appointing Kandyans loyal to the British Crown. Although the office remained a powerful one till the late 19th century, it soon became an honorary post and title. The last to hold the title was Sir Tikiri Bandara Panabokke, who was appointed to the honorary post of First Adigar in 1940. After his death in 1963 no appointments were made. Functions The Mah√¢ Adig√¢r was second in power and dignity to the monarch, and there was usually two in number who possessed equal powers. Like many of the other high offices in the country the Mah√¢ Adig√¢r had combined legislative and judicial powers. They acted as judges to the Wahal Habe (the King's Court) and also had the command of the guards called Katupulle, and would act as chief of the military and on field commanders during military campaigns. Though the office was very powerful, his emoluments and influence was less than that of a Mah√¢ Diss√¢va, a provincial governor, so the government of a province was added to his office of Adig√¢r. Being Prime Minister also, the Adig√¢r would reside in the city which was the seat of government, however according to Kandyan law his wife and children would be taken as hostage for his good conduct, during his absence, whenever he visited the provinces over which he was Dissava. The Adig√¢r signed all land grants made by the King and appointed junior officers. Tenure There was no time limit for the office holder as he held the post at the pleasure of the King, which meant throughout his life, if not incurred the displeasure of the King. It was not hereditary, although members of the same family have been appointed. Wealth With his appointment into office the Adigar would have to pay the king, his appointee, five hundred \\"Silver Coins\\", and a similar sum every new year (dakum). However he would in turn receive large sums of money through junior officers he has appointed receiving around 10 silver coins per year from them. The Adigar further received a portion of fines collected, income from ferries operated, and from liberated prisoners.

It is shared by an inter-Nation forum between MiÍûåkmaq First Nations and is divided into seven geographical and traditional districts, with an eighth representing Taqamkuk today. MiÍûåkmaÍûåki is one of the confederate countries within Wabanaki. Each district was autonomous, headed by a Sagamaw, who would gather alongside Wampum readers and knowledge keepers called Putus, a women's council and the Kji Sagamaw, or Grand Chief, to form the SanteÍûå or MiÍûåkmawey MawioÍûåmi (Grand Council). The seat of the SanteÍûå MawioÍûåmi is at Mniku in UnamaÍûåkik and still functions as the capital today in the Potlotek reserve. Following contact, MiÍûåkmaÍûåki was colonized by the French and British Nova Scotia colonies and their competing claims for the land. Siding with the French, the MiÍûåkmaq fought alongside other Wabanaki troops during the global wars between 1688-1763. The European powers divided MiÍûåkmaÍûåki in the treaties of Utrecht (1715) and Paris (1763). The British claimed MiÍûåkmaÍûåki as their possession by conquest and the defeated MiÍûåkmaq signed the Peace and Friendship Treaties to end hostilities and encourage cooperation between the Wabanaki countries and the British and ensure the survival of the MiÍûåkmaq people whose numbers had dwindled to a few thousand from disease and starvation. The power held within MiÍûåkmaÍûåki faded further after the Confederation of Canada united the colonies and Canada passed the Indian Act, and the loss of autonomous governance. Today, the SanteÍûå MawioÍûåmi functions solely as a spiritual and dialogue forum, with oversight held by the Government of Canada through individual MiÍûåkmaq First Nations instead of MiÍûåkmaÍûåki and the Kji Sagamaw. The traditional lands' sovereignty has never been ceded by the MiÍûåkmaq, although legal arguments have been made that the Peace and Friendship treaties legitimized the takeover of the land by Britain. Governance MiÍûåkmaq camp in UnamaÍûåkik in 1857 Traditionally each district had its own independent government. Those governments were composed of a chief and a council. The council included the band chiefs, elders and other important leaders. The role of the councils was similar to those of any independent government and included to edict laws, establish a justice system, divide the territory for hunting and fishing, make war and search for peace. The overarching Grand Council SanteÍûå MawioÍûåmi was composed of the keptinaq (captains), the district chiefs. The Grand Council also included elders, putus (historians reading the belts) and a Council of women. The Grand Council was headed by a grand chief who was one of the district chiefs, generally the UnamaÍûåkik chief. Succession was hereditary.

It is located about west of Sodo in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region. Once fully commissioned, it will be the third largest hydroelectric plant in Africa with a power output of about 1870 Megawatt (MW), thus more than doubling total installed capacity in Ethiopia from its 2007 level of 814 MW.Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation:Gibe III Hydroelectric Project Official Website , accessed on May 7, 2012Energy Information Administration: Ethiopia Energy Profile , accessed on October 27, 2009 The Gibe III dam is part of the Gibe cascade, a series of dams including the existing Gibe I dam (184 MW) and Gibe II power station (420 MW) as well as the planned Gibe IV (1472 MW) and Gibe V (560 MW) dams. The existing dams are owned and operated by the state-owned Ethiopian Electric Power, which is also the client for the Gibe III Dam. The US$1.8 billion project began in 2006 and began to generate electricity in October 2015. The remaining generators would be operational by 2016. The project has seen serious delays; in May 2012, full commissioning had been scheduled for June 2013.Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation:Gibe III Hydroelectric Project Official Website , accessed in May 2012 The dam was inaugurated by Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn on 17 December 2016. Local and international environmental groups expect major negative environmental and social impacts of the dam and have criticized the project's environmental and social impact assessment as insufficient. Because of this and accusations that the entire approval process for the project was suspect,BBC News:The dam that divides Ethiopians, March 26, 2009, accessed on October 17, 2009 funding for the full construction cost has not yet been secured, as the African Development Bank has delayed a decision about a loan pending a review of the dam's environmental impact by its compliance review and mediation unit which in August 2009 accepted a call from NGOs for such a review.Ethiofact.com:AfDB to probe Ethiopian dam project, 4 August 2009, accessed on December 20, 2009 In August 2010 Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi vowed to complete the dam \\"at any cost\\", saying about critics of the dam that \\"They don‚Äôt want to see developed Africa; they want us to remain undeveloped and backward to serve their tourists as a museum.\\"News Business Ethiopia:Meles Vows to Complete Gibe III Dam at Any Cost, 11 August 2010, accessed on 18 September 2010 Design The Gilgel Gibe III Dam is and high roller-compacted concrete dam.

The normal operating level of the reservoir is above sea level with a maximum of and minimum of . The dam's spillway is long and floodgate-controlled with a maximum discharge capacity of . Water above above sea level can be discharged through its gates. Feeding the dam's power house are two penstocks that each branch into five separate tunnels for each individual turbine. The power house contains ten 187 MW generators supported by Francis turbines for a total installed capacity of 1,870 MW. The initial design of the dam foresaw a rock-fill dam. However, due to difficulties with obtaining proper and sufficient insurance coverage for the rock-fill dam, the design has been changed to roller-compacted concrete. Benefits The main benefit of the dam will be electricity generation that is both renewable and dispatchable. It is expected to supply about half of its power to Ethiopia and export the other half to Kenya (500 MW), Sudan (200 MW) and Djibouti (200 MW).\\"Ethiopia, Italian Company Sign $2 Billion Hydro Power Project\\" (All Africa), subscription required; accessed 21 July 2006 However, no Power Purchase Agreements have been signed yet between Ethiopia and any of these countries. Only Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding to purchase electricity from the dam. Financing for a transmission line to Kenya was approved by the World Bank in July 2012. Access to the electricity grid in Ethiopia currently is very low. Less than 2% of Ethiopia's rural population, which accounts for 85% of the total population, have access to the grid. With the support of the World Bank the government is carrying out an ambitious project to expand rural electricity access.Ethiopia Electric Agency:Ethiopia Energy Access Project, accessed on October 17, 2009 In 2003, low generation capacity combined with a severe drought caused power cuts lasting 15 hours twice a week for a period of six months, costing an estimated $200 million in economic output. In 2008 and 2009, Ethiopia again experienced power cuts and brownouts. According to the International Rivers Network the power cuts were caused by drought, since almost all electricity generation in Ethiopia is hydroelectric. According to the same source, despite an increase in access to the electric grid, electricity consumption is likely to remain low for the foreseeable future due to the prevailing level of poverty. Even without the Gibe III hydro plant, according to one source Ethiopia had a surplus installed capacity of 400 megawatts.Allafrica.com:Ethiopia: AfDB Set to Start Funding Country's Gibe Dam, July 3, 2009, accessed on December 20, 2009 Under Ethiopia's current development plans it is said that the country will be more than 95% dependent on hydroelectric power. Ethiopia also predicted that the electricity power exports can bring about $407 million a year for the country and this amount is well above the country's most valuable coffee export. A secondary benefit of the project will be flood protection. In 2006, a flood claimed the lives of at least 360 people and thousands of livestock in the lower Omo River basin. Allegedly, a further benefit would be a reduction in the impact of droughts,Seleshi Bekele and Jonathan Lautze:Blowback:Ethiopia's Gibe III dam: a balanced assessment, Los Angeles Times, accessed on May 7, 2012 presumably through the planned large, Ethiopian-owned irrigated sugar plantations. Controversy The project is controversial because of its environmental and social impact, the magnitude of which in itself is a subject of controversy; because of the award of the construction contract without competitive bidding; and because of an alleged lack of transparency in project affairs. For example, the environmental and social impact assessment was not published until two years after construction began. The assessment suggested that the project would cause minimal problems environmentally and socially. However critics consider it to be flawed both in terms of thoroughness and objectivity. Among these critics is the African Resources Working Group who released statements saying that \\"The quantitative [and qualitative] data included in virtually all major sections of the report were clearly selected for their consistence with the predetermined objective of validating the completion of the Gibe III hydro-dam\\" and that despite claims made by the government to the contrary, the dam would \\"produce a broad range of negative effects, some of which would be catastrophic.\\" Another prominent critic of the dam is the Kenyan paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey who said that \\"the project is fatally flawed in terms of its logic, in terms of its thoroughness, in terms of its conclusions\\".Richard Leakey:The Gibe III dam must be stopped, March 26, 2009 In June 2011 UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, in its 35th session held in Paris, France, called for the construction of the dam to be halted, to submit all assessments of the dam and requested Ethiopia and Kenya to invite a World Heritage Centre/IUCN monitoring mission to review the dam's impact on Lake Turkana, a World Heritage Site. Environmental and social impact According to the Ethiopian authorities, once the dam has been built the total amount of water flowing into the lake will not change. The only difference would be a more stable flow over the year - more during the dry season, and less during the wet. Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said in a BBC interview: \\"The overall environmental impact of the project is highly beneficial. It increases the amount of water in the river system, it completely regulates flooding which was a major problem, it improves the livelihood of people downstream because they will have irrigation projects, and it does not in any way negatively affect the Turkana Lake. This is what our studies show.\\"Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi in a BBC interview, March 2009, Minutes 4:25 to 5:10 According to critics, the dam will be potentially devastating to the indigenous population.African Resources Working Group:A Commentary on the Environmental, Socioeconomic and Human Rights Impacts of the Proposed Gibe III Hydrodam in the Lower Omo River Basin of Southwest Ethiopia, January 2009, accessed on October 17, 2009 The dam will stop the seasonal flood, which will impact the lower reach of the Omo River and Lake Turkana as well as the people who rely on these ecosystems for their livelihoods. According to Terri Hathaway, director of International Rivers' Africa programme, Gibe III is \\"the most destructive dam under construction in Africa.\\" The project would condemn \\"half a million of the region's most vulnerable people to hunger and conflict.\\"BBC:Web campaign against Ethiopia Gibe III dam, 23 March 2010 Impact on the livelihoods of the inhabitants of the lower Omo River Valley Omo River Valley in 2010 It is estimated that more than 200,000 people rely on the Omo River below the dam for some form of subsistence such as flood recession agriculture, and many of these ethnic groups live in chronic hunger. Critics state that the Gibe III dam may worsen their situation. Indigenous people rely on recessional cultivation of food along the riverbanks, as well as livestock herding, for survival. The Gibe III dam and the associated decrease in water levels and seasonality of flows in the Omo River threaten the continuation of the only two options for survival in this arid environment‚Äîthere are no alternatives. The people living in the project area are part of the Southern Nations of Ethiopia, a highly diverse group of people. Ethnic groups affected by the dam include eight distinct indigenous communities: the Mursi, Bodi (Mekan), Muguji (Kwegu), Kara (Karo), Hamer, Bashada, Nyangatom and Daasanach.International Rivers Network:Ethiopia‚Äôs Gibe 3 Dam: Sowing Hunger and Conflict , May 2009, accessed on October 17, 2009 Stephen Corry, Director of the indigenous rights organization Survival International said, \\"The Gibe III dam will be a disaster of cataclysmic proportions for the tribes of the Omo valley. Their land and livelihoods will be destroyed, yet few have any idea what lies ahead. The government has violated Ethiopia‚Äôs constitution and international law in the procurement process. No respectable outside body should be funding this atrocious project.\\" Other sources note that, when interviewed, people in many villages have never even heard of the Gibe III dam, and many of them did not even know what a dam was. This is an indication of the failure of consultations and informed consent for the indigenous populations. Survival, together with the Campaign for the Reform of the World Bank, Counter Balance coalition, Friends of Lake Turkana and International Rivers have launched a petition to stop the dam.Survival International:Giant dam to devastate 200,000 tribal people in Ethiopia, 23 March 2010 Dam proponents argue that artificial floods are planned to be released from the reservoir. Furthermore, irrigation projects are envisaged to improve the livelihoods of the downstream population. As it became known to a wider public in November 2011 through a report by the Oakland Institute, there are indeed massive plans for cotton and sugarcane plantations on 445,000 ha in the lower Omo Valley. The sugarcane plantations could be financed with aid from India, which is heavily engaged in developing Ethiopian sugar production. The investors in the plantations are mostly Ethiopian state-owned companies. Reports about human rights violations There are also reports about human rights violations by the Ethiopian army against locals who oppose the sugar plantations in the lower Omo Valley that would be irrigated with water from the dam's reservoir. According to the reports, \\"villagers are expected to voice immediate support, otherwise beatings (including the use of tasers), abuse, and general intimidation occurs\\", (...) \\"instilling a sense of fear regarding any opposition to sugar plantation plans.\\" Impact on the ecosystems of the lower Omo River Valley The decreased water flow of the Omo River resulting from the Gibe III dam will have significant impacts on the ecosystems surrounding the river. The Omo River Basin is home to the only pristine riparian forest remaining in the drylands of sub-Saharan Africa. The survival of this forest is dependent upon the seasonal flooding of the Omo River, which will cease with construction of the dam. This may cause 290 km2 of forest to \\"dry out\\" from lack of water. The decreased water flow will also negatively impact, if not eliminate, all economic activities associated with the Omo River such as farming, fishing, and tourism. The water level of the Omo River is crucial for recharging groundwater supplies in the Omo basin. If the water level of the river drops once the Gibe III dam is built, then it will no longer be able to refill underground water supplies, leaving much of the basin bereft of groundwater, which negatively impacts people and ecosystems. As the water level of the Omo River drops, the erosion of its riverbanks will increase, causing increased sediment flows in the river, loss of soil for crop cultivation along the riverbanks, and loss of riparian habitats. A December 2012 study stated Ethiopia's Gibe III dam would cause humanitarian catastrophe and major cross-border armed conflict. Construction of one of the world's tallest dams on the Omo River in southern Ethiopia will lead to mass starvation among a half million indigenous people in an already famine-prone region, sparking major armed conflict in the three-nation border region over its disappearing natural resources, according to a new report from the African Resources Working Group (ARWG). \\"Humanitarian Catastrophe and Regional Armed Conflict Brewing in the Transborder Region of Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Sudan: The Proposed Gibe III Dam in Ethiopia\\" analyzes the full scale of impacts of the dam and charges that no environmental or social review of the full cross-border impact area has been carried out by the Ethiopian government or international development banks involved in the project, including the World Bank. It is authored by a member of the ARWG and long-term researcher in the region, Claudia J. Carr, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The 250-page report is based on substantial field-based research involving the participation of local residents throughout much of the cross-border region. The Gibe III dam is already under construction by Ethiopia along its Omo River, with general recognition that it will cause a major decrease in river flow downstream and a serious reduction of inflow to Kenya's Lake Turkana, which receives 90 per cent of its waters from the river. According to the ARWG report, these changes will destroy the survival means of at least 200,000 pastoralists, flood-dependent agriculturalists and fishers along the Omo River 300,000 pastoralists and fishers around the shores of Lake Turkana - plunging the region's ethnic groups into cross-border violent conflict reaching well into South Sudan, as starvation confronts all of them. The report offers a devastating look a deeply flawed development process fueled by the special interests of global finance and African governments. In the process, it identifies major overlooked or otherwise minimized risks, not the least of which is a U.S. Geological Survey estimation of a high risk for a magnitude 7 or 8 earthquake in the Gibe III dam region. Impact on Lake Turkana The magnitude of the impact that the dam and possible irrigation projects induced by the dam will have on the water level of Lake Turkana is controversial. A hydrological study conducted for the African Development Bank in November 2010 concluded that the filling of the dam will reduce the lake's water level by two metres, if no irrigation will be undertaken. Irrigation would cause a further drop in the lake level. Friends of Lake Turkana, a Kenyan organization representing indigenous groups in northwestern Kenya whose livelihoods are linked to Lake Turkana, had previously estimated that the dam could reduce the level of Lake Turkana by up to 10 meter affecting up to 300,000 people.Bank Information Center:Kenyan indigenous groups file complaint with AfDB on Ethiopian dam, March 2, 2009, accessed on October 17, 2009 This could cause the brackish water to increase in salinity to where it may no longer be drinkable by the indigenous groups around the lake. Currently, the salinity of the water is about 2332 mg/L, and it is estimated that a 10-meter decrease in the water level of Lake Turkana could cause the salinity to rise to 3397 mg/L. Raising salinity could also drastically reduce the number of fish in the lake, which the people around Lake Turkana depend on for sustenance and their livelihoods. According to critics, this \\"will condemn the lake to a not-so-slow death.\\" According to dam proponents, the impact on Lake Turkana will be limited to the temporary reduction in flows during the filling of the reservoir. Various sources state that the filling could take between one and three wet seasons.Statement by Salini on Ethiopia News:Gibe III project Facts, 1 April 2010, accessed on September 18, 2010 The total storage volume of the reservoir of Gibe III dam will be between 11.75 and 14 billion cubic meter, depending on sources. According to the firm that builds the dam this would reduce the water level in the lake by \\"less than 50 cm per year for three years\\" and that salinity \\"will not change in any way\\". According to the International Lake Environment Committee, 90% of Lake Turkana's water is delivered by the Omo River on which the Dam would be built. With no outlet, Lake Turkana loses 2.3 meters of water every year to evaporation, and its level is sensitive to climatic and seasonal fluctuations. For purposes of comparison, the historic level of Lake Turkana declined from a high of 20m above today's level in the 1890s to the same level as today in the 1940s and 1950s. Then it increased again gradually by 7 meters to reach a peak around 1980, and subsequently decreased again. The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) summary of the project did not assess the impact of the dam on the water level and water quality of Lake Turkana.Gibe III Hydroelectric Project:Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Summary for Gibe III hydroelectric project, accessed on October 17, 2009 The director of Kenya's Water Services Regulatory Board, John Nyaoro, argued that the dam would have no negative impact on Lake Turkana.Water 21, Magazine of the International Water Association:Ethiopia's Gibe III dam funding under review after protests against its impact, p. 5, October 2009 Other impacts It was predicted that there is about 50-75% leakage of waters from the reservoir due to multiple fractures in the basalts at the planned reservoir site. Due to the loss of the waters in reservoir, the dam would not be able to produce as much electricity and less hydro power would be available to export to other nearby countries. Also, the dam and reservoir are vulnerable to seismic activity such as earthquakes and massive landslides in the Gibe III project region. The earthquakes can cause even larger fractures to the dam and are susceptible to more water leakage as well as decreasing the economic inputs. Moreover, the landslides would fill up the reservoir and less water capacity can be stored. This would also mean that less hydro power can be produced. Environmental and social impact assessment Controversy arose also as the environmental and social impact assessment and preceding environmental impact study (EIS) were not done until two years after beginning construction on the dam. The Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority requires that an environmental impact assessment be done for any project \\"likely to entail significant adverse environmental impacts\\" and that \\"the EIS must submitted before commencing any construction or any other implementation of the project.\\" Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority: Permit Requirement Published 2006. Accessed 8 June 2010. Official environmental and social impact assessment An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) has been carried out by Centro Elettrotecnico Sperimentale Italiano (CESI) and Agriconsulting of Italy, in association with MDI Consulting Engineers from Ethiopia. According to Anthony Mitchell, an engineer who submitted an independent feasibility study of the dam to the African Development Bank, CESI's owners include vendors who can benefit from the project and this conflict of interest is not disclosed in the impact statement.Anthony Mitchell:Gilgel Gibe III dam Ethiopia: technical, engineering and economic feasibility study report, April 15, 2009, accessed on March 24, 2010 As part of the assessment, according to the Project Company, public consultations were carried out with \\"officials and institutions, people affected by the project and non-governmental organizations\\". According to critics, these consultations have been minimal. Most importantly, the assessment was only completed in July 2008, nearly two years after construction began, in violation of Ethiopian law and in contrast to global good practice of environmental assessments. Also, an independent environmental advisory panel has been established only as late as July 2009, apparently in a belated effort to appease criticism of the project. Alternative environmental impact statement The Africa Resources Working Group (ARWG), a collaborative of eight consultants from around the world, conducted an independent environmental impact statement of their own for the Gibe III dam. The alternative impact statement was performed because of the alleged corruption and inaccuracy of the official impact assessment. The ARWG criticizes many of the statements made in the official Gibe III ESIA. Regarding the flow of water into Lake Turkana, they state that the Gibe III dam will result in a 57-60% decrease of river flow volume. The ARWG also notes that it is not necessarily the volume of water that is important to the Omo River and Turkana ecosystems, but that the seasonality and timing of the water flow is crucial, because certain biota are adapted to feeding, reproducing, growing, etc. in response to seasonal changes in water flow. Artificially releasing water from the Gibe III dam into the Omo River will not be sufficient to meet the needs of these biota. Additionally, the ARWG states that there is \\"no precedent of successful and sustained implementation\\" of an artificial flood simulation program in sub-Saharan Africa, so it is not guaranteed that such a program will be maintained at the Gibe III dam. Award of construction contract The contract for the construction of the dam was awarded in 2006 to Salini Costruttori of Italy. The engineering design was awarded to Studio Pietrangeli and supervision of ELC-COB (ELC Electroconsult, Italy - Coyne et Bellier, France) as representative of the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation. The contract to Salini Construttori was awarded after direct negotiation rather than allowing bidding on the contract from other qualified companies. Public international financial institutions require competitive bidding of construction contracts, making it difficult for the Ethiopian government to get a loan from them. The bypassing of the standard process was defended by general manager of the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation, Mihert Debeba, as skipping a set of \\"luxurious preconditions\\" that Ethiopia could not meet, one which would completely halt any development of hydroelectric power. Costs and financing The financial costs of the dam and hydroelectric power plant have been estimated to be 1.55 billion Euro. The cost of a transmission line from the power plant to the nearby Wolayta Sodo Substation has been estimated at 35 Million Euro. These costs do not include the costs of constructing or upgrading power transmission lines to Addis Abeba and onwards to Djibouti to the Northeast of the dam, to Sudan in the West and to Kenya in the South, all located at a distance between 500 and 1000 km from the dam. The cost estimate does not include the costs of extending the electricity distribution network to effectively increase access to electricity. As of 2009, electricity access in the prospective beneficiary countries was still low at 16% in Kenya and 36% in Sudan. According to the official website of Gibe III, most of the construction cost of the dam itself is financed by the Ethiopian government with its own funds. However, part of the project is financed through a corporate bond called \\"Millennium Bond\\" issued by the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) and marketed with the Ethiopian diaspora.Genet Mersha, Abugida Information Center:LET THERE BE LIGHT!‚ÄîTHE GILGEL GIBE SAGA, THE BOND & DILEMMA OF ETHIOPIAN DIASPORA, April 6, 2009, accessed on March 24, 2010 The Ethiopian government also had requested financing of US$250 million from the Italian government for civil works. In 2008, JPMorgan Chase and the Italian export credit agency SACE refused to provide financing. In May 2010 EEPCo and Dongfang Electric Machinery Corporation, a Chinese state-owned company, signed a memorandum of understanding to provide electrical and mechanical equipment for the project. The agreement is backed by a loan from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China reportedly covering 85% of the US$495 million cost.International Rivers: China‚Äôs Biggest Bank to Support Africa‚Äôs Most Destructive Dam Published 13 May 2010.

Previously the European Investment Bank (EIB) had been considering financing of the dam's electrical and mechanical equipment with a loan of US$341 million. It has financed economic, financial and technical studies for the dam. In July 2010 the EIB stopped financing environmental and social studies for the dam, stating that \\"alternative financing\\" had been found.Bloomberg:EIB Halts Funding of Gibe III Dam Studies in Ethiopia 19 July 2010, accessed on 18 September 2010 The African Development Bank had also been considering a US$250 million loan for the electro-mechanical equipment of the plant. The World Bank also had considered funding the project. In 2008 the World Bank decided not to pursue a full feasibility study for the dam, because of the absence of competitive bidding for the prime contractor. The Exim Bank of China finances the transmission line to the Addis Ababa. The contract has been awarded to the Chinese Company Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd. (TBEA) on July 24, 2009. In July 2012 the World Bank approved a US$684 million loan for an Eastern Electricity Highway Project that will finance a 500 Kilovolt High Voltage Direct Current transmission line between the Wolayta/Sodo substation in Ethiopia and the Suswa substation in Kenya. Environmental groups have criticized the loan as funding for the Gilgel Gibe III Dam through the backdoor.

The estate was owned by members of the de Meergaard family from 1819 to 1947. The main building serves as a venue for classical concerts and other cultural activities. The cultural centre also includes Fuglsang Art Museum, located in a purpose-built building designed by British architect Tony Fretton. History Early history The history of the estate can be tracked back to 1368. The original fortified castle was located a few hundred metres further north, where remains can still be seen. The location at the edge of marshland where Flintinge Stream mouths in the Guldborgsund Strait, close to the only ford in the area, has made it of strategic importance in the area. In the 16th century, Fuglsang was moved to its current location on a larger islet, surrounded by broad moats. This building was demolished in 1849 and replaced by a Neoclassical main building. The park, still seen today, was also founded at this event. Rolf Viggo de Neergaard took over the property from his parents in 1866, but due to fungal attacks on the timber, the only 26-year-old building had to be demolished. The current building was built from 1868-69 to the design of his cousin architect J. G. Zinn who has also designed several buildings at the Holmen Naval Base in Copenhagen. Artist's retreat Carl Nielsen and family at Fuglsang In 1885, de Neergaard married the 30 years younger Bodil Neergaard, and together they opened the house to a large number of visiting artists and particularly musicians until Rolf Viggo de Neergaard 's death. Both the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg and the Danish composer Carl Nielsen were frequent visitors to the house and close friends of the couple. Upon her husband's death in 1915, Bodil Neergaard managed the large estate alone, and organized the social and church life of the household. In 1947, she bequested the estate to a trust, providing that her home and garden should be made a retreat upon her death. After her death in 1962, Refugiet Fuglsang was founded and served as a retreat for artists and other people of note until it had to close in 1995. The following year a local musical society was founded, arranging 9 annual concerts. Since 1997, the Storstr√∏m Chamber Ensemble has been based at Fuglsang. In January 2008, Fuglsang Art Museum opened in a purpose-built building close to the Fuglsang main building. Interior The Agnethe and the Merman ceiling The music room, also known as the Agnethe Room (Danish: Agnethestuen), features a fresco representing a scene from the Danish folk tale Agnethe and the Merman. The painting was created by the painter Axel Viggo W√∏rmer. V√∏rner has also created the Pompeian decorations in the Fuglsang's library. The library is the former billiard room. The billiard table is now located in the Prime Minister's summer residence Marienborg. Today Today Fuglsang serves as a venue for concerts and other cultural activities.

Many close relatives of the King being commonly appointed. They received a portion of the taxation as pay and also large land grants from the King, some being hereditary. Along with Maha Adigars and a few others high officials of the kingdom they made up the Radala caste, who were referred to as the Chieftains of Kandy by the British.

The civil, military and judicial administration of these units were carried out by a Dissava appointed by the Portuguese Captain General in keeping with the tradition of the land. The Dissava led the Lascarins which was the local militia in time of war. Initially both Sinhalese and Portuguese were appointed to this post, thereafter Portuguese were preferred. He was assisted in military functions by Mudaliyars, Muhandirams and Arachchis. In judicial functions he was assisted by Basnayakas and Mohottalas. Each Disavanis was divided into sub units called Korales. These were presided by a Korale Vidana, who was a magistrate and revenue collector. The Dutch continued the system of administration of the Portuguese, but gradually reduced the power of the local headmen. The Dissavas were members of the Political Council of the Commendary the locality they belong to. Following the expansion of British rule into the provinces of the former Kandyan Kingdom in 1815, the British retained the office of Dissava reporting to a board consisting of the British Resident in Kandy and two assistants. Following the Uva Rebellion in 1818 and changers to the administrative divisions of the island with the creation of Districts, British Government Agents took over the duties of the Dissava, with the remaining and newly appointed Dissavas being mere honorary titles appointing Kandyans loyal to the British Crown as honors. After Ceylon suspended honors in 1956, these appointments were never made.

It is the second episode from Season 4, the 67th episode overall, and the conclusion to a two-part episode. Plot In the wake of Daniel's return to Mode and handing Megan's story idea back to Betty, Betty finds herself being under attack from everyone (as evidenced by a fantasy sequence involving arrows and Wilhelmina ready to carve her up), but Hilda brings her back to reality at home. At work, she tells Daniel that she's not ready, sort of, but at the meeting Wilhelmina challenges Betty to come up with something bolder than the insect jewelry concept. While looking through her notes she discovers a new and last-minute idea after she sees a piece of cloth on a photo of a model. Wilhelmina goes with the idea but causes more bad blood for Betty's co-workers, especially for Matt and Megan, because they think Betty and Daniel are still a team. At Daniel's apartment that night, Daniel's temper has Betty concerned, even as she tries to help him. He begins to lose it whenever he thinks of Molly and almost throws an object at Betty, but stops. Betty decides to stay to watch him, but at the expense of her co-workers. After waking up late she arrives at the United Nations, where the chaos ensues over responsibilities, as Betty tries to please a designer, feuding models, and Matt showcasing a smiling mosquito. This leads Betty and Matt to argue and when he accuses her of sleeping with Daniel, Daniel shows up and punches Matt. The breakdown would result in Wilhelmina taking over the shoot and Betty relieving herself and Daniel from the set. As they walk away Betty and Daniel talk about what has happened between the two of them and that they should move on from boss and assistant to just being friends. Daniel also decides that it is time to seek help for his anger. At home, after looking at her \\"blog,\\" Betty decides to change her image, so she takes the dress suit Christina sent and wears it to work, along with the new glasses to replace the broken ones. When she arrives at work everyone is surprised to see a \\"New Betty\\" although Amanda and Marc are still out of the loop somewhat. The \\"New Betty\\" also apologizes to Matt about what happened at the shoot, then tells him that she won't answer to Daniel but adds that she has decided to move on from Matt. She also shows Megan her infamous poncho from her first day at Mode that she now has framed to hang on the wall at her office. As she walks out of the building that evening, she turns down Daniel's offer to ride with him in favor of taking her own limo. Meanwhile, Wilhelmina runs into a private investigator, who then proceeds to tell Wilhelmina about Nico's boyfriend. This makes Wilhelmina more concerned and when she tries to convince Nico to talk about what happened that night when she was attacked by Jonathan, which in turn led to Nico pushing him off the yacht the night of his disappearance. Although they give the detective a false alibi, we learn in flashbacks that they actually went to the yacht to get rid of the evidence that might tie Nico to Jonathan's demise. The ploy works, except for a small blood stain that is still visible on the yacht. At home Justin is upset over Hilda talking to Marc. This has Hilda telling Ignacio a way to help Justin, even as going far as trying to start a network social site, which Ignacio thinks is a bad idea, even after reminding her about what she did when she was a teenager with the pregnancy that resulted in Justin. When she visits Marc the next day at work, she changes her tune and allows Marc to be friends. Hilda then later talks to Justin about his situation at school and that he can turn to her if he wants to. At Amanda's reception desk she encounters a visitor named Helen, a former receptionist who has just been hired as a temp, and the two strike up a friendship. While at the desk later that evening Helen reveals to Amanda why she gave her job up and when she tells Amanda about her past it parallels Amanda, and she begins to take a look at her own future. The following day Amanda sees Helen taking things after her temp assignment is finished, which seem to mirror Amanda taking stuff from The Closet. Amanda then gives her the earpiece she uses to Helen as a reminder of their friendship. Production In an interview with TV Guide, creator Silvio Horta admitted that Paula Abdul was to guest star in this episode, but the show went with Kristen Johnston instead. \\"We got many, many calls about her wanting to be on the show. The idea was Amanda sees a version of herself that has gone wrong and I thought, \\"Paula has expressed interest in doing the show. What about this part?\\" At that point, it was just one episode. There was any one of a number of miscommunications, and it got fouled up.

The postal history of Hungary is strongly linked to the history of Hungary. While a messenger system was brought to the Carpathian Basin by √Årp√°d as early as 895, modern mail delivery was first organized by the Habsburgs under the Austrian Empire. After continued development, the postal systems of Austria and Hungary were formally separated following the Compromise of 1867, with both becoming fully independent after 1908. Both world wars caused heavy damage to the infrastructure. The Hungarian Post was nationalized after 1947. Until 1990, the Post Office controlled not only mail and package delivery, but also the full range of telecommunications, including radio, telephone and television transmissions. When the Post Office was split into separate companies, Magyar Posta JSC was established to handle postal administration. The Middle Ages After the colonization of the Carpathian basin in the period up to the late 16th century, the messages of the Hungarian kings were delivered by messengers (pracecones) and couriers (cursores), but counts and lords also maintained separate messenger services. The common people had to ask travelers and merchants to deliver their packets. After the 15th century a service of communal messengers was established to act as an official link between local authorities, assisted by the newly invented carriage. In 1526, Ferdinand I entrusted the Taxis family with the operation of a permanent postal service between Vienna and Pressburg/Pozsony (modern Bratislava). Leopold I issued a postal patent regulating postal delivery routes, post offices and posthorns. The operation of the postal system was later transferred to the Paar family as a feudal tenure. During R√°k√≥czi's War for Independence a separate postal system was operated in the territories under R√°k√≥czi's rule, operated by J√°nos Szepesi, and later by M√°rton Kossovits. On 1 July 1722 Charles III nationalized the postal system, and declared the delivery of messages and the establishment of post offices to be a state monopoly. He placed the imperial coat of arms on every postal building, regulated postal tariffs, and developed the existing postal routes, subordinating every post office to the main post office at the imperial court in Vienna. The language of administration was German, and most of the employees were Austrian. In 1784 Maria Theresa's Postal Patent further modernized the system, separating normal and mail-coach delivery. The mail-coach service started one year later throughout the empire, establishing a permanent route between Vienna and Buda in 1752. 1800-1867 The 1 kr stamp of M√≥r Than. The first public mailboxes for letters were introduced in 1817. Telegraphy appeared, but was not widely used until its development and standardization of language by Samuel Morse. The first telegraph station on Hungarian territory was opened in December 1847 in Pozsony. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 attempts were made to create a separate system under the supervision of the Agricultural, Industrial and Commercial Ministry. One of the first tasks of its minister, G√°bor Klauz√°l, was to legislate for privacy of correspondence, and the use of Hungarian language and symbols in stamps and seals. M√≥r Than designed what was intended to be the first Hungarian stamp, but due to later military developments it was never printed. An 1868 newspaper stamp of Hungary. After the failed revolution of 1848, the Hungarian post was reabsorbed into Austrian administration. Franz Joseph I issued a Postal Patent on 26 December 1850, which restored pre-1848 conditions. There were several developments in the next few years, including the unification of normal and mail-coach delivery, and the introduction of stamps and of money orders in 1850. From 1855 letters were delivered to home addresses, trains started to carry letters, and express delivery was introduced in 1859. Postage stamps were issued for the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary on 1 June 1867 in eight values along with one 1 Kreuzer (krajc√°r in Hungarian) newspaper stamp.Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue Part 2 Austria & Hungary. 6th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2002, p.180. Stamps of Austria were withdrawn from the Kingdom of Hungary on 31 May 1867. The dual monarchy stamps were in use there for just over one year. After 1867 As ratified in the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Hungarian post was reassigned to the Agricultural, Industrial and Commercial Ministry of the Kingdom of Hungary. Minister Istv√°n Gorove had appointed Mih√°ly Gervay as the managing director of Hungarian post. It was decreed by law that the posts of Austria and Hungary were to be treated separately, but under the same principles. The use of the Hungarian language and the national symbols was restored. The emblem of the post was created (a tasseled postal horn, under the Hungarian crown) and was used until the end of World War Two. The current emblem is a simplified version of this design. The K.u.K. (Imperial and Royal) Empire stamps (2 to 50 kreuzer) remained in use until 31 July 1871.Die Poststempel auf der Freimarken-Ausgabe 1867 von √ñsterreich und Ungarn, Edwin Mueller, 1930 ) 5 kreuzer cancelled at Pest Lipotvaros in 1869 The first specifically Hungarian stamp was released on 1 May 1871. The stamp was produced by the State Press of Buda by lithography, followed by an engraved set and newspaper stamps. There was no indication of language, but the face of Franz Josef appeared above the national emblem, for values 2 to 25 kreuzer. The 25 kreuzer image helps to distinguish the issues. 25 kreuzer engraved and lithographed (right stamp) The very first impression was of poor quality and most of it had to be destroyed. Only a small quantity of this impression was released, in August 1873, and stamps of this impression are rare (2 kreuzer dark yellow). In 1869, for the first time anywhere in the world, the Austrian and Hungarian post began to process Postal cards (not to be confused with postcards), which do not need a separate stamp (Korrespondenz Karte in German).See the article Postcard in Wikipedia The popularity of this method of communication is demonstrated by the delivery of over 2.5 million postal cards in 1871. By 1873 the figure reached 6.5 million and in 1900, an estimated 25 million items were delivered. From 1870 onward, after passing an exam, woman over 18 years were allowed to work in treasury and post offices. The Hungarian Post was one of the founding members of the Universal Postal Union in 1874. From 1885 smaller packages were delivered directly to individual addresses. In 1887 the Emperor approved the proposal of minister G√°bor Baross to unify the post and telegraphy services, and to provide the required experts for the purpose. The Post and Telegraphy College opened in the following year. After 1875 telephone lines began to be built around the empire, later regulated by the 1888 article of telegraphs and electrical signaling apparatus, which also prohibited citizens from setting up or operating public phones. The interurban telephone line between Vienna and Budapest was completed by 1890, with all major cities being connected during the next three years. 1871 Second issue, engraved stamps of Hungary The mechanization of the post began before the end of the 19th century. Mechanically-emptied mailboxes started to appear from 1893, and two years later delivery motor tricycles were introduced for permanent use. After 1896, bicycles were introduced to deliver letters and express mail. The first Hungarian car was designed for the Hungarian Post (in response to a tender in 1903), by mechanical engineer J√°nos Csonka. Its 2000 km test drive through the country started on 31 May 1905, and was successfully completed. Hungary was one of the first countries to use cars in mail delivery (from 1909), using Csonka's model for the next two decades. For a number of years the cars also carried passengers. 20th century The full independence of the Hungarian Post was declared in article XII of 1908. World War I, and the subsequent military occupations and revolutions, caused severe damage to the postal system, requiring a near complete rebuild. The first notable development was the opening of a 250 watt radio phone station in Csepel in 1923. The station's original task was to transmit news to the regional offices of the Hungarian news wire agency, but in empty air times music and songs were transmitted on an experimental basis, starting on 15 March 1924. From 1933 onwards, regional transmitter stations were opened, also upgrading the Csepel station to 120 kW (with a height of 314m). In the early part of the 20th century the stamps mainly depicted the mythical \\"Turul\\" or Hungary's first king, St. Stephen. Following the change of currency in 1892, the 20th century saw many further changes of currency including the Korona (until 1927), the Peng≈ë (until 1946) and from 1946 onwards, the Forint (with the subdivision Fill√©r until 1999). The growing workforce required social investments. During the Horthy era, from 1920 onward, the post office opened holiday resorts, medical facilities, sanatoriums, canteens and a retirement home for their staff. In 1927 the first internal regulation for dealing with mail was published and Article 35 of the 1936 parliamentary regulations consolidated all previous postal regulations into a single Article. World War II placed many new demands on the postal services, including the operation of the military post, the postal development and administration of the territories removed from Hungary by the Trianon Treaty after World War I and restored to Hungary by the Third Reich (the First and Second Vienna Awards). The ravages of World War II destroyed most of the previous decades' achievements and most of the system had to be rebuilt from scratch. A widely used 10 fill√©r porto (postage due) stamp from the second half of the 20th century. However rebuilding was rapid. Mail delivery was operating again from March 1945 in Budapest and from May in the whole country, with money orders starting in June and package delivery, telephone and telegraph in July. From 1 May 1945 the Hungarian Radio Corporation broadcast again. Recovery, including buildings and personnel, was not complete until 1952. Consistent with the political climate, the Hungarian Post was gradually nationalized after 1947, with several postal companies and institutions either ceasing to exist or becoming part of the national organisation. Consistent with the era's technical developments, the transmitting service was rapidly upgraded in the following decades. Experiments with television broadcasting started in 1950, with official (but still experimental) broadcasts starting in 1953. In 1958 a television broadcast tower was put in operation on the summit of the Sz√©chenyi mountain. 1967 saw the introduction of the crossbar technology and in 1970 the time- sharing multiplex system, opening the first container telephone station. Recent years Starting in 1980 significant changes began in the structure of the Hungarian Post. It became a prime authority in 1983 (named the Centre of Hungarian Post). Hungary is famous for its use of goldleaf in its stamps and is sometimes categorised with the Czech Republic, Serbia and Austria. After the change of regime in 1989 the institution dissolved into 3 separate entities, namely the Magyar Telekom, the Hungarian Broadcasting Company, and the Hungarian Post Company, each continuing a task of the formerly unified firm in the form of independent, self-supporting companies. In his article LIII. of 1992 the minister of traffic, telecommunications and water conservancy declared the Post company to be a state owned joint stock company. The new Post, natively named the Magyar Posta R√©szv√©nyt√°rsas√°g started on 1 January 1994, and is the legal successor of the former Hungarian Post (Magyar Posta V√°llalat). Due to legal reasons, the proper native name changed to Magyar Posta Zrt. (shortened) on 2 January 2006. Postal stationery The first items of postal stationery to be issued by Hungary were postcards in 1869 followed by envelopes in 1871 and newspaper wrappers in 1872. Lettercards were issued in 1886 and aerogrammes were first issued in 1969.Higgins & Gage World Postal Stationery Catalog See also * List of people on stamps of Hungary * Magyar Posta * Postage stamps and postal history of Austria References and sources ;References ;Sources *Vilmos, Hennyey.

It is the third episode from Season 4, and the 68th episode overall. Plot The story begins with Betty helping out at Hilda's Beautilities, where she helps Hilda try to get money so Justin can attend private school. Betty mentions to the family that she has just been promoted to associate features editor, but at work, Betty is discovering how cruel Matt can be when she gets a bean bag for a seat at a meeting. Matt is also upset with Betty over the botched photo shoot, and now her job is on the line. However, thanks to a family friend named Sammy, Betty could get the break she might need when she learns of a Dolce & Gabbana designer, Evan Grant, leaving the company to join Gucci. Marc tells Amanda about trying to get back at Betty by taking her job, a plot supported by Wilhelmina. So when he learns of Betty's job being in jeopardy, he gets wind of the interview that Hilda pitched to Betty via a three-way phone call. Marc tries to sabotage it by any means necessary, he finds himself trying to be friendly to Betty while pulling out all the stops to find out how to steal the interview, even after getting a birthday cake from her (which he doesn't like). Later that evening, Marc discovers Betty avoiding Matt, so he finds her weakness. That's when Marc comes up with the perfect plan: pair Amanda with Matt for a dinner date at the same restaurant that Betty was going to that evening. To the two, they think it's just that, a dinner date, even as Marc uses that ruse so Betty can be jealous of Matt while Amanda can get Marc the scoop from Betty, without the three finding out. At the restaurant, the dinner between Betty and Evan goes off very well, especially with Hilda and Ignacio as waitress and chef. But the evening becomes more interesting when Matt and Amanda show up. Betty and Matt try to keep their distance even as Hilda interferes. Betty is not happy about what Hilda is doing even after lying to Matt about Betty dating another guy. Betty at the same time suspects that Matt and Amanda are also dating, leading the two to become very suspicious of other each and try to one up each other. This reaches boiling point when Evan ends the dinner, followed by Matt arguing with Betty, and Amanda, believing that Matt wanted to date her so she can make Betty jealous, walks out after telling him that she was not interested. After Matt and Betty are brought into the kitchen by Hilda to talk, Betty tells Matt that she tried to get him an interview, but Matt inadvertently ended all hopes for landing the story. Angry, she tell Matt that he is a spoiled brat and he only cares about the end of their relationship because, for once, he didn't get his way. Matt in turn admits that he was a little jealous of her happiness and that he might have taken it too far. Matt later turns up at Amanda's place to apologize, and she accepts. Betty also comes by to apologize, but when she learns that it was Marc who set the reservation, both ladies discover that Marc used Amanda to get the scoop for him. The next day Betty confronts Marc and tells him that she refuses to be bullied, while Amanda slaps him for lying to her about his scheme. As Betty walks by the meeting room, she sees Matt put a chair in place of the bean bag. Daniel is still healing from the punch he gave Matt (as evidenced by his bandaged hand) when Betty and Claire remind him to go his bereavement meeting. At the meeting, Betty gets proof that Daniel is at the place after he hands over his phone to a woman named Natalie, who then begins to strike up a conversation, which in turn leads to an evening together. As the two visit a swimming pool, Natalie tries to get Daniel to open up about Molly as a way to cap off a perfect evening. Finally, Wilhelmina gets a surprise phone call from her bounty hunter: He has found Connor! She flies to Bermuda to confront him. While there, she waits for him at the hotel he was staying at. Thinking that he might have left the country again to avoid her, Wilhelmina discovers Connor right in front of her. Connor is aware of Wilhelmina's suspicions and then kisses her, believing that she still has feelings for the fugitive embezzler. Unfortunately, Wilhelmina comes home empty-handed and consoles Marc over their latest defeats.

Retrieved on 17 Oct 2009. and was constructed by the Harzwasserwerke between 1928 and 1931. It is used for flood prevention, electricity generation, supplying drinking water and for raising water levels during times of low water. The construction of the dam cost 14.7 million Reichsmarks at the time. The Harzwasserwerke still operate the dam today. In 1933 construction began on a long-distance water pipe from the S√∂se reservoir, whose northern branch goes as far as Bremen. Today it mainly supplies towns and communities in the Hildesheim and Hanover areas. Since 1980 the town of G√∂ttingen has also been supplied with drinking water from the reservoir.  Main dam  The main barrier is an earth-fill dam with a central concrete core and clay sealing. The hydro-electric power station, which is used to supply electricity at peak loading periods, has a power of 1.44 MW and an annual energy output of 3.10 GWh. The spillway is located on the southern abutment of the dam with the hillside.  Pre-dam  The S√∂se Reservoir has a pre-dam (Vorsperre) upstream, which is 200 m long and 20 m high and has a volume of 0.75 million m¬≥. Its reservoir acts as a sediment trap to catch any particles in the river before they get to the main reservoir. In addition there is also a stilling basin (Ausgleichsbecken) below the primary dam, with a 10 m high dam wall, which controls any irregularity arising from the flow of water through the primary dam, power station and waterworks.

In 1890 Budworth became one of the original members of the Barbarians Football Club. Personal history Budworth was born in 1867 in Greensted, Essex, to Philip John Budworth and Annie Emily Thomas. He was educated at Christ College, Brecon, before matriculating to Magdalen College, Oxford. Upon leaving university he taught at Lancing College in West Sussex and then between 1898 and 1907 at Clifton College. He eventually settled in the North of England becoming headmaster of Durham School (1907 to 1932). During his teaching profession Budworth entered the priesthood and was ordained in 1902, before becoming a canon at Durham Cathedral. Rugby career Budworth first came to note as a rugby player when he represented Oxford University while studying at Magdalen College. He played in three Varsity Matches, from 1887 to 1889 winning his sporting 'Blues'. During the 1889/90 season and now playing for Blackheath, Budworth was first selected for the England national team, playing in the first English game of the 1890 Home Nations Championship. The English team, although talented, was fairly inexperienced after they missed the previous two Championships. In windy and snowy conditions, England lost to Wales at Crown Flatt in Dewsbury.Griffiths (1981), pg 1:7. Budworth then missed the two remaining games of the Championship, but was reselected for the 1891 Championship for the encounters with Wales and Scotland. After away victories over Wales and then Ireland, the later of which Budworth missed, the England team faced the Scottish in the tournament decider. Despite great early performances from the pack, against Scotland the forwards were routed and the Scottish won in a convincing manner.Griffiths (1981), pg 1:8. Budworth never represented his country again. As well as his international career, Budworth was also of note in the field of rugby football as he was one of the original members of the invitational touring team, the Barbarians. He played in their inaugural match at Hartlepool in 1890 and went on to represent the side on five occasions, competing in his last match in 1892 against the Corinthians.

Their home ground was Ninian Park which was also used by Cardiff City FC. The club spent three seasons in Cardiff before relocating to Bridgend in 1984 as the Bridgend Blue Dragons, who were finally wound up in 1986. The team colours were royal blue shirts with a yellow and white vee. The shorts and socks were also blue. In 2014, the two main Rugby League clubs in the city, Cardiff Demons and Cardiff Spartans merged. As a result, the 'Cardiff City RLFC' name was revived and a new club formed, with a modernised badge and kit paying homage to the original side. The 1st and 2nd open age sides will be playing senior home matches at Cardiff Arms Park during the 2015 Welsh Conference season. The club was renamed Cardiff Dragons in 2016. For 2017 Cardiff Rugby League [Cardiff Dragons] sides play at The Memorial Ground, Ely following a partnership with Glamorgan Wanderers RFC. The club includes Wales' first Women's & Masters Rugby League sides and is the largest in Wales by number of players. History Early history of rugby league in Cardiff In 1947‚Äì48 and 1951‚Äì52, following a successful stint in the Welsh League, Cardiff was elected to the Rugby Football League. However, after one disastrous season with low attendances, the club withdrew. Cardiff City Blue Dragons RLFC The initial success of rugby league teams Carlisle and Fulham RLFC which were backed by Carlisle United and Fulham association football clubs respectively, encouraged Cardiff City to form Cardiff City Blue Dragons for the 1981‚Äì82 season. Their managing director was David Watkins, their coach was John Mantle. The club initially signed three (former) rugby union internationals ‚Äì Steve Fenwick, Tom David and Paul Ringer. A fourth (former) international, Brynmor Williams, was signed later on. Their first game against Salford on 30 August 1981 attracted a crowd of 9,247. Despite finishing half-way up the Second Division in their first season, success on the field was elusive and the club failed to win promotion in three seasons at Ninian Park. Towards the end of their tenure in Cardiff crowds had dwindled to about 500 and they were forced into liquidation after the death of Cardiff City chairman Bob Grogan. Their last home game was a 28‚Äì26 loss to York. In July 1984 the club was bought out of liquidation by a consortium. The new owners came under pressure from the Welsh FA who wanted Ninian Park as their permanent headquarters and were opposed to ground sharing with rugby league. As a result the Blue Dragons changed their name to Bridgend Blue Dragons and relocated the club to Bridgend Town AFC's Coychurch Road ground. Bridgend Blue Dragons RLFC Their first home game on 9 September 1984 attracted a crowd of 1,983 to watch Bridgend go down 28‚Äì16 to Swinton. After that attendances dropped and by February 1985 less than 200 fans were watching the home games. Their lowest gate was 148 for the final home game against Doncaster on 21 April 1985 when they went down 28‚Äì10. The club finished bottom of the Second Division with only one win. Four days before the start of the 1986‚Äì87 season the Rugby Football League dropped Bridgend Blue Dragons from the fixtures for failing to secure a ground and Bridgend RLFC decided not to seek reinstatement.

Lippincott Company It was created upon the dissolution of the Philippine Military Academy. Cadet Terry Adevoso, refused to simply go home as cadets were ordered to do, and began recruiting fighters willing to undertake guerrilla action against the Japanese. This force provided intelligence to the liberating forces led by General Douglas MacArthur, and took an active role in numerous battles, such as the Raid at Los Ba√±os. Origin When war broke out in the Philippines, the staff and cadets of the Philippine Military Academy came down from Baguio to Manila. On December 19, 1941 on the grounds of the University of Santo Tomas the cadets of Class 1942 and 1943 graduated earlier and received their commissions, and under their Superintendent Col. Fidel V. Segundo (USMA 1917) formed the 1st Regular Division. Some 300 cadets of Class 1944 and 1945 were in turn disbanded and told to go home as they were considered too young to fight in the war. The cadets of these classes formed the nucleus of the Hunters ROTC by January 1942, with Miguel Ver in command, and Eleuterio Adevoso as his Executive Officer. The Hunters ROTC banded together in a common desire to contribute to the war effort throughout the Bataan campaign. They worked to protect civilians and to assist the USAFFE forces by way of intelligence and propaganda. They were founded in Manila in January 1942 by Miguel Ver of the Philippine Military Academy, and moved to Rizal Province in April where they came under Col. Hugh Straughn's FAIT. After the Japanese captured Straughn and Ver the executive officer, Eleuterio Adevoso took over. Japanese Occupation Personal stories of sacrifice and heroism have been passed down through the generations of former Hunters ROTC members. As recalled by former member Damaso Fernandez, the omnipresent reign of the Japanese occupation force in Manila was punctuated with the threat of murdering one's whole family if caught hiding intelligence. One particular memory etched in Damaso's mind was when he was hiding a piece of intelligence to give to liberating forces in his pillowcase. The Japanese raided and searched his home including his mattress without finding the papers. After the surrender of American and Filipino forces on Bataan, the Hunters ROTC relocated to the Antipolo mountains. The Hunters originally conducted operations with another guerrilla group called Marking's Guerrillas, with whom they went about liquidating Japanese spies. Led by Miguel Ver, a PMA cadet, the Hunters raided the enemy- occupied Union College in Manila and seized 130 Enfield rifles. The Hunters was one of the more effective south Luzon guerillas.[ article on guerrilla groups in Luzon http://www.bataandiary.com/Research.htm#Guerrilla_Units.] Philippine Liberation Campaign They were among the most aggressive guerrillas in the war and made a daring guerrilla raid on June 24, 1944 at the New Bilibid Prison used by the Japanese in Muntinlupa, Rizal, with collaboration with the FACGF Fil-American Cavite Guerilla Forces of General Mariano N. Castaneda to free their captured members and to obtain more than 300 rifles in the armory. This was the only time an armed force was able to successfully enter New Bilibid. Most famous success of the Hunters ROTC was their participation in the liberation of Los Ba√±os prison camp on February 23, 1945. While units of the 11th Airborne Division came over to Los Ba√±os, members of the Hunters ROTC pre-positioned themselves around the camp a few days before, relaying intelligence up-to-date intelligence reports on the camp. Captain Bartolomeo Cabangbang, leader of the Central Luzon Penetration Party, said that the Hunters supplied the best intelligence data on Luzon. During the Battle of Manila (1945), the Hunters ROTC, under the command of Lt. Col. Emmanuel V. de Ocampo, fought with the U.S. Army from Nasugbu, Batangas to the Manila General Post Office.Connaughton, R., Pimlott, J., and Anderson, D., 1995, The Battle for Manila, London: Bloomsbury Publishing, The Hunters also jointly operated with the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary and the American soldiers and military officers of the United States Army in many operations in Manila, Rizal, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas and Tayabas (now Quezon). Legacy The Headquarters Philippine Army (HPA) parade ground at Fort Bonifacio is named Hunters ROTC Field. In February 1945, this area of Sakura Heiei (Cherry Blossom Barracks), as this military installation had been renamed by the Japanese, was overrun by the Forty-seventh ROTC Division as it led the advance of American Eleventh Airborne Division into this military installation. Additionally, in Quezon City, there is a street named Hunters ROTC, and in Cainta a street formerly named St Francis Avenue now bears the name Hunters ROTC Avenue. There is a memorial along the latter road dedicated to the guerrilla organization. In film * Death was a Stranger. 1963. * Unsurrendered 2: The Hunters ROTC Guerrillas.

A thinly-populated farming area with no settlements apart from the farms, it is best known for sharing its name with Braydon Forest. The population of the parish was 48 in 1881 and was little changed in 2011, at 43. The River Key, a tributary of the Thames, rises in the parish. Ravensroost Wood, in the far west of the parish, is a nature reserve managed by Wiltshire Wildlife Trust. History Evidence has been found of prehistoric people, including a Neolithic axehead and a possible Palaeolithic flint tool. In 903, the rebel Saxon √Üthelwold of Wessex and the Viking raiding-army from East Anglia raided Braydon and the surrounding area.Swanton, M. 2000 The Anglo- Saxon Chronicles (London: Phoenix Press) In the Middle Ages, Braydon was a tithing of Purton and belonged to the Duchy of Lancaster, giving rise to the name of Duchy Wood, and passed to the Crown with the rest of the Duchy. Red Lodge was a royal hunting lodge until the land was developed in the 17th century. In 1826, the Crown exchanged Braydon for other land and it thus came into the ownership of the 3rd Earl of Clarendon, who had previously leased it. In 1829 the estate was sold to Joseph Neeld of Grittleton, at which time it consisted of divided into several farms, called Battle Lake, Cock's Hill, Duchy, Maple Sale, Park Gate with Roebuck, Pound House, Raven's Roost, Red Lodge, and White Lodge. In 1901 the Neeld estate was broken up, and by 1910 about half of Braydon belonged to Mr J. E. Ward, whose granddaughter Elizabeth Ward owned Red Lodge, Pound and Coxhill farms in 2007. A small school was built in 1858 and became a National School in 1876. The school closed in 1933 owing to falling pupil numbers. In 1866, Braydon became a civil parish separate from Purton. In 1887 Braydon was said to be \\"occupied chiefly by squatters, who led a wretched life\\".Wiltshire Archaeological Magazine, XXIII, p. 164 Religious sites A small Anglican church was built in 1868, and later moved to a site near the Ashton Keynes road (now the B4696). The church closed in the 1970s and became a private house. Braydon Methodist chapel was built in 1889, just over the southwest boundary of the parish. It is a \\"tin tabernacle\\" constructed with corrugated iron, and is still in use as of 2016. Braydon Forest In the year 688, C√¶dwalla, king of the West Saxons, granted Abbot Aldhelm of Malmesbury Abbey thirty hides on the eastern side of Braydon Wood (de orientali parte silve Bradon). At its greatest extent, Braydon Forest covered about a third of the area of Wiltshire, but over the centuries most of it was slowly cleared.\\"Braydon: a study of settlement in a parish-edge forest\\", Paul Pattison, David Field, Stewart Ainsworth, Patterns of the past: essays in landscape archaeology for Christopher Taylor (1999) Governance With its tiny population, Braydon is considered too small to merit a parish council and has instead a parish meeting. Most significant local government functions are now carried out by the Wiltshire Council unitary authority.

Biography At the early age of 13, Paulo Brissos started to learn music at the Ateneu Art√≠stico Vilafranquense amateur school, where he played clarinet in the band for a few years. Later, he taught himself to play the guitar and consequently began writing his own songs. In 1986, he began singing in bars in Lisbon and in 1991 he started his first steps as a resident singer on the TV shows ET and Sons do Sol. His first appearance as a singer for a large audience was at the Portuguese RTP song contest for the European Eurovision Song Contest in 1991 with the vocal group Blocco. In 1993, he went solo at the same contest with the song \\"No Dia Seguinte\\". In 1994, he released his first album, People Amigo, and in 1997 signed a contract with the multinational Polygram and released his second album, Cria√ß√£o. This album provided two singles, \\"Cria√ß√£o\\" and \\"Ser√°s Tu\\". The song \\"Ser√°s Tu\\" was part of the soundtrack of the Portuguese television drama series Terra M√£e and is now part of the soundtrack of the drama series Sentimentos. In 2001, he released the EP Sete e Meia and in 2003 the album Direitas, from which the single \\"Mulher Ideal\\" was part of the soundtrack for the television drama Olhar da Serpente. He produced the first records of Sergio Rossi and Paula Teixeira and as a songwriter wrote songs for Portuguese artists including Excesso, Sergio Rossi, Paula Teixeira, Adelaide Ferreira, and Ana Isabel Baptista. In 2007, Brissos graduated in music production at Valencia Community College and in 2009 released his first live CD/DVD, Concerto Acustico, on the Espacial label.

The Malaghan Institute specialises in the immune system, and how it can be harnessed to improve human health. Its key areas of research and discovery are cancer, asthma and allergy, infectious disease, gut health and brain health. In 2019, the Institute began New Zealand's first clinical trial of CAR T-cell therapy, trialling a third-generation CAR T-cell therapy in partnership with Wellington Zhaotai Therapies. The concept of a Wellington-based, independent medical research institute was first proposed in the early 1960s. At that time, relatively little medical research was carried out in New Zealand due to a lack of facilities and support by hospital boards. Using funds from a trust established by the Wellington Medical Research Foundation and the Wellington Division of the Cancer Society, the Wellington Cancer and Medical Research Institute was opened on 26 July 1979, in rented premises in the Wellington School of Medicine. In 1986, the name of the Institute was changed to the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research in recognition of the generous support by Len Malaghan, the co-founder of Tip Top Ice Cream Ltd (later General Foods) and his wife Ann, whose gift of 100,000 shares in the company seeded the Institute. Len died of cancer in 1967 at the relatively young age of 61. The Institute is a registered charity, relying on support from the community, the corporate sector and contestable grants. In 2004 the Institute relocated to a purpose-built facility at Victoria University of Wellington. The founding Director was Dr William Stehbens. Current Director Professor Graham Le Gros was appointed Research Director of the Malaghan Institute in 1994, following a three-year Fogarty Fellowship at the National Institutes of Health, Washington DC, and a five-year scientist position with Ciba-Geigy in Basel, Switzerland. In 2014 he was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for his services to medical research.

Built on eolianite hills next to a small promontory forming the sole anchorage able to provide shelter to seagoing vessels between Jaffa and the Sinai, Yavne-Yam is notable for its role as the port of ancient Yavne. Excavations carried out by Tel Aviv University since 1992 have revealed continuous habitation from the second millennium BCE up to the Middle Ages; the famous Yavne-Yam ostracon is named after the site. History Bronze and Iron Ages Surveys and excavations undertaken at Yavne-Yam during the 1950s and 1960s have revealed the existence of a large fortified site, consisting of a square enclosure with freestanding ramparts and marked by fortified gates, dating from the Middle and Late Bronze Age, during the second millennium BCE. This has also been confirmed by underwater surveys undertaken in the harbor, which have uncovered pottery characteristic of the period. Yavne-Yam may be the coastal city of Mu·∏´·∏´azu (mHz) mentioned in the Amarna letters,Stieglitz R. 1974. Ugaritic Mhd ‚Äì the harbor of Yabne-Yam? Journal of the American Oriental Society 94, pp. 137-138.Archeology in Israel - Yavne Yam a name reminiscent of the Aramaic word for port. It was inhabited during the late Iron Age, as testified by the Egyptian pottery and scarabs found at the site, as well as the discovery of Eastern Greek Pottery and several Hebrew- inscribed ostraca in nearby Mesad Hashavyahu. During the late 7th century BCE, the region apparently passed from Egyptian to Judean control, and was populated by Israelites, Canaanites, Phoenicians and perhaps even Greeks. Hellenistic Port Inscription documenting correspondence between Antiochus V and Yavne-Yam's Sidonian community The material culture uncovered at the site suggests that under Persian rule, Yavne-Yam was inhabited by Phoenicians from Sidon, also revealing a strong Hellenic influence. Alexander the Great's conquest of the Levant magnified such effects, and Yavne-Yam displays the prosperity and increased Hellenization of the population resulting from the political changes brought about by the Macedonian conquest and subsequent Ptolemaic and Seleucid control. It was this Hellenization which eventually led to the Seleucid-Jewish conflict of the 2nd century BCE. What begun as tensions between hellenized and observant Jews, in 166 BCE erupted into an open revolt against the Seleucid Empire. Cities that had been thoroughly hellenized, such as Yavne (Iamnia) and Yavne-Yam, suffered the brunt of the Maccabean Revolt. According to 2 Maccabees, Judas Maccabeus, first leader of the revolt, \\"attacked the people of Jamnia by night and set fire to the harbor and the fleet, so that the glow of the light was seen in Jerusalem, thirty miles distant.\\"2 Maccabees 12:9 Discoveries at the site and elsewhere, however, cast doubt on this account. During a preliminary survey conducted in December 1986, a fragmentary Greek inscription was found in Yavne-Yam, documenting correspondence between Seleucid king Antiochus V Eupator and the local Sidonian community. Dated to the summer of 163 BCE, it reveals the longstanding cooperation of the town with Seleucid authorities, at a time when inland Yavne was known as a base for operations against the rebels.1 Maccabees 5:58-59 Furthermore, the discovery on Delos of altars erected by the citizens of Iamnia and the persistence of Greek ware in the archaeological record have led archaeologists to believe Yavne-Yam had in fact resisted Maccabean attacks and remained a free Greek city for decades after the rebellion. It was eventually sacked and incorporated into the Hasmonean state in the late 2nd century BCE, during the rule of John Hyrcanus or Alexander Jannaeus. Roman, Byzantine and Islamic Jewish independence in Judea came to an end in the 1st century CE and the region gradually came under Roman control. Although archaeological remains from the Roman period are scant, Yavne-Yam is nevertheless mentioned in contemporary literature, including the works of Josephus, Pliny the Elder and Claudius Ptolemaeus. It re-emerged as a prosperous center of commerce during the Byzantine period, when it was populated by Christians, Jews and Samaritans. In the 5th century, Empress Aelia Eudocia sponsored the construction of a church and a hostel in the town, which was also the residence of Peter the Iberian, a Georgian Orthodox saint. Following the Islamic conquest of the 7th century, the port became known by various names such as mahuz Yibna (harbor of Yavne), mahuz a-tani (second harbor, the first being Ashdod-Yam), or Minet Rubin (harbor of Rubin), after the nearby traditional burial place of biblical Reuben. These appear in works of prominent Arab geographers Al-Muqaddasi and Muhammad al- Idrisi. It became a Ribat, a fortified coastal lookout point where prisoner exchanges with the Byzantines were carried out, and a citadel, still partially visible today, was built on its southern promontory. The transformation of the town into a military outpost led to the departure of the non-Muslim population. For reasons unknown, the site was abandoned in the 12th century. It is nevertheless depicted in several medieval maps such as Abraham Ortelius' 1584 map, where it appears as Jamnia Iudeorum Portus (Jamnia, the Jewish harbor). Excavations Surveyed and explored during the 1950s and 1960s, Yavne-Yam was first excavated between 1967 and 1969 by Tel Aviv district archaeologist Jacob Kaplan. Concentrating on the perimeter fortifications, Kaplan unearthed a number of superimposed gates dating from the Middle and Late Bronze Ages.Seevers, B. Four-Chamber Gates In The Ancient Near East From The Middle Bronze Through The Iron Ages Excavations by Tel Aviv University resumed in 1992, under the direction of Prof. Moshe Fischer. These are still ongoing and are centered on the coast, bay and promontory. In 2007, a 6th- century Byzantine villa featuring a mosaic floor depicting trees and fruit baskets was uncovered at the site. Excavations on the promotory in 2011 revealed a Roman-style bathhouse within the 9th century Early Islamic period fortifications. The use of Roman technology at such a late date was previously unknown. The bathhouse is also the only known example of a bathhouse in an Islamic fortress. Since 1980 underwater surveys have also been taking place in the harbor. These have revealed shipwrecks, anchors and fishing devices, all suggestive of intense maritime activity from the Bronze Age to modern times. In 2008, a lifeguard diving at the site found an Ophthalmos, a 4th or 5th century BCE marble discus measuring 20 cm in diameter. Resembling an eye, these adorned the bow of ancient ships and were supposed to protect the ships from the evil eye, envy and danger, while also assisting navigation. That same year, Moshe Fisher and Itamar Taxal on behalf of Tel-Aviv University's Institute of Archaeology conducted archaeological research at the site.Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2008, Survey Permit # G-65 Prominent finds from Yavne-Yam and its vicinity are on display at Beit-Miriam, the museum of nearby Kibbutz Palmachim.

His writings primarily deal with the cultural and sociological woes of Italy following World War II. Much of his literature draws on issues raised through his work as a magistrate. His most significant work is likely the novel Diario di un giudice (Diary of a Judge), written in 1962. In 2005, Troisi was posthumously awarded the Feronia Literary Prize, an award given to distinguished poets and authors. Biography Dante Troisi was born in Tufo, a small town in the Province of Avellino, on April 21, 1920. He attended a secondary school in Avellino, and obtained a law degree from the University of Bari. Troisi was drafted into the Italian military during World War II, and fought during the campaigns in Libya and Tunisia. In May 1943, Troisi was captured by Allied forces. He was sent to a prison camp in Hereford, Texas and remained there until the end of the war. After the war, Troisi returned to Italy in 1947 and became a judge in Pavia. Later on, he was elevated to the position of magistrate, first in Cassino and then in Rome. Troisi died on January 2, 1989 before the publication of his final work, La sera del concerto (The Night of the Concert), after struggling with a serious illness for two years. Writings Troisi's first work as a writer was the book L'ulivo nella sabbia (The Olive Tree in the Sand) and was written in 1951. The story revolves around the relationship between a judge and a man charged with hiding a cachet of weapons. The two were formerly friends while serving together in northern Africa during World War II. The plot is primarily a psychological one‚Äîcontrasting the two men and how they dealt with the war. Innocente delitto (Innocent Crime) was written in 1960 and dealt with the problems between the generations of post-war Italy. Diario di un giudice (Diary of a Judge), drawing heavily from his experience as a judge, was written in 1962 and deals with the difficulty of the job. Troisi felt that there was a deep mistrust of the Italian judicial system. Troisi's writings, while very pessimistic at times, were filled with challenges to morality and philosophy. His style was marked by a concentration on dialogue, and left little room for scenery description or plot development. Although Troisi's style has been compared to that of the existentialist Albert Camus, it is more accurate to say that he was a moralist, showing his concerns for the social and ideological issues of his time.
