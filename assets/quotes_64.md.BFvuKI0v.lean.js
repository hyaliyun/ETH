However, with the fall of the Queen, he was received at the court of Chlothar II and his lands restored.\\"Saint Romaric\\", Nominis Disenchanted with life as a courtier, Romaric experienced a religious conversion through the missionary efforts of Amatus of Grenoble, a monk of Luxeuil Abbey. Romaric entered Luxeuil and trained to be a monk. With the approval of Abbot Eustace, Romaric and Amatus founded a double monastery for men and women, later given the name of Remiremont (Romarici Mons). The monastery was built on land belonging to St. Romaric, when he was a count palatine. One of the earlier monks in Remiremont was St. Romaric's friend St. Arnulf. Around 625 Romaric succeeded Amatus as abbot. He directed several members of his family who embraced religious life there: two of his daughters, Azeltruda and Zeberga, his granddaughter Gebetruda, and his grandson Adelphus. Romaric died in 653.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ) Romaric is recognized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church, with a feast day on December 10 or December 8.

The film was released in Hong Kong on 21 April 1979. Plot Tang How-yuen (Jackie Chan) is a disciple of kung fu master San-thye. San-thye wins a martial arts tournament, only to be killed by evil kung fu master, Master Li (Yen Shi-kwan). Tang tries unsuccessfully to fight Chung, and leaves the evil master unharmed. Tang, along with San-thye's wife and daughter head after the killer to seek revenge. When they find him, Chung has repented and has cut off his own leg as penance. The master's widow becomes ill, so Tang goes to work for a gang in order to get her medicine. However, whilst in their employ, he is blamed for the death of a young boy, and San-Thye's widow is poisoned. Tang and the one-legged master join forces to defeat the evil lord who poisoned San-thye's widow.

As a result, both Lo Wei productions only had cost-cutting measures after Chan returned from his loan deal with Seasonal Films, where he made Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and Drunken Master alongside director Yuen Woo-ping. During the production, Chan reportedly had his nose broken repeatedly, joking \\"Do you think I was born with this nose?\\" Unlike most of Jackie Chan's early films, Dragon Fist had a more serious tone, with little in the way of comedic moments. Like many other Hong Kong kung fu films, the film was scored with various musical cues from American films, mainly Jerry Goldsmith's 1966 score for The Sand Pebbles. Box office The film grossed 1,004,000 at the Hong Kong box office in 1979. In South Korea, the film sold 103,261 tickets in Seoul City.

In the Internal Revenue Code itself, the precise term is \\"minimum required distribution\\".See subsection (b) of . Retirement planners, tax practitioners, and publications of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) often use the phrase \\"required minimum distribution\\". Lifetime distributions Individuals with IRAs are required to begin lifetime RMDs from their IRAs no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which they reach age 72. IRA owners do not have to take lifetime distributions from Roth IRAs, but after-death distributions (below) are required. They can always withdraw more than the minimum amount from their IRA or plan in any year, but if they withdraw less than the required minimum, they will be subject to a federal penalty. The monetary penalty is an excise tax equal to 50% of the amount they should have withdrawn, but did not. This penalty is in addition to ordinary income at the individual's marginal rate and any state income taxes. The RMD rules are designed to spread out the distributions of one's entire interest in an IRA or plan account over one's life expectancy or the joint life expectancy of the individual and his or her beneficiaries. The purpose of the RMD rules is to ensure that people do not accumulate retirement accounts, defer taxation, and leave these retirement funds as an inheritance. Instead, required minimum distributions force the holder to withdraw at least some of the funds as taxable distributions while still alive. Unlike most distributions from IRAs and qualified plans, RMDs are never eligible for rollover; they must be withdrawn. Because the distributions are not rollover-eligible, however, taxes are not required to be withheld at the time of distribution, and may thus be postponed until the individual files a Federal income tax return for the year. Any amount withdrawn above the minimum required amount will be eligible for rollover within 60 days of the distribution. Income tax must be withheld from that portion if the rollover option is not elected. Income tax is generally not due on any part of the RMD which is paid to a charity. These are called Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCD). Employer-sponsored qualified retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans, require the same distributions that IRAs do. The beginning date requirement may be later than the date for IRAs. Although the rules require RMDs to begin by April 1 of the year after the individual reaches age 72, participants in an employer-sponsored plan can usually wait until April 1 of the year after retirement (if later than age 72) to begin distributions unless the individual owns 5% or more of the employer who is sponsoring the plan. In addition, employer-sponsored plans differ from IRAs in rules relating to aggregation. A person with multiple IRAs may add the balances in each account to determine the total RMD for the year, then take that full amount from a single IRA, or split it in any manner between two or more IRAs. However, employer-sponsored plans must remain distinct; the RMD calculation for each is performed separately, and the distributions must be taken from each plan individually. Exception: If the individual has more than one 403(b) tax- sheltered annuity account, the individual can total the RMDs and then take them from any one (or more) of the tax-sheltered annuities After death distributions Distributions after death must be made to the named beneficiaries of the decedent's IRA or qualified plan. Legislation passed in 2006 allows qualified retirement plans to be amended to offer a \\"nonspouse rollover\\". If the rollover is available, a beneficiary may make a direct transfer of the funds to an inherited IRA, which must be in the name of the decedent for the benefit of the named beneficiary. This became effective beginning in 2007. IRA beneficiaries do not require a nonspouse rollover; an IRA beneficiary can have a decedent's IRA retitled as an inherited IRA without a rollover transaction. (Spouses have much greater rollover rights and can delay distributions until their own age 72 if they choose.) A nonspouse IRA beneficiary must either begin distributions by the end of the year following the decedent's death (they can elect a \\"stretch\\" payout if they do this) or, if the decedent died before April 1 of the year after he/she would have been 72, the beneficiary can follow the \\"5-year rule\\". The suspension of the RMD requirements for 2009 also meant that when counting the 5-year rule, 2009 was disregarded.  The 5-year rule  Under the 5-year rule, the entire account balance must be withdrawn over a 5-year period. The rule does not require a certain amount each year, or an even division between the five years. However, with the 5-year distribution method, the entire remaining balance becomes a required distribution in the fifth year. If a decedent has named his/her estate or a charity as beneficiary and the 5-year rule applies, no \\"stretch\\" payout is possible. If an estate or charity is beneficiary of a part of the account, the same holds true unless certain remedial measures are taken by September 30 of the year after death. The 5-year rule does not apply if the decedent died after having started his/her required minimum distributions (generally if he/she died later than April 1 after reaching age 72). In that case, there is no 5-year rule, and the beneficiary takes distributions over the longer of his/her own life expectancy or the remaining life expectancy that the decedent would have had (using government tables). If the IRA owner named a non-person (such as his estate) as the beneficiary, and had died after beginning required minimum distributions, then the estate or other non-person beneficiary may take distributions over the remaining life expectancy the decedent would have had. If the decedent died before age 72 and the beneficiary does not start a lifetime payout by the end of the year after death, the 5-year rule does apply. Also, if the decedent died before that date and had no beneficiary (for example if he/she named the estate as beneficiary, or a charity) the 5-year rule applies. Many retirement plans also trigger the 5-year rule.  Overview  This is an overview of rules based on Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9). The rules are detailed at Treas. Regs. 1.401(a)(9)-1 to -9 and 1.408-8.T.D. 8987, Federal Register, volume 67, beginning at page 18988, dated April 17, 2002. The nonspouse rollover rules were passed in Section 829 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and interpreted by IRS Notice 2007-7, 2007-5 IRB 1.

The incident caused a media sensation and her case has ever since represented a highly controversial and debated issue of Hungary-Slovakia relations. On 4 April 2014, Slovak attorney general charged Malina with perjury.http://www.hirek.sk/belfold/20140404160913/Heves-reakciokat-valtott- ki-a-Hedvig-elleni-vademeles.html If found guilty, she would face up to 3 years in prison. Andrej Kiska, the president of Slovakia, said that he would grant Malina pardon in case she is convicted. Malina took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, challenging what she calls the \\"inhuman and humiliating\\" conduct of the Slovak officials. She reportedly told the N√©pszabads√°g that she was looking for \\"moral satisfaction.\\" Before the tribunal, the Slovak government offered an agreement to the lawyer of Hedvig Malina, in which the Slovak authorities would apologize for their treatment. On 8 November 2011 the European Court of Human Rights approved the Slovak government's apology.  Claim of violence  Malina claims she was severely beaten and robbed on 25 August 2006 in Nitra after speaking Hungarian in public. She claims her attackers wrote \\"SK (probably Slovakia) without parasites\\" (), and \\"Hungarians to the other side of the Danube\\" (Maƒèari za Dunai) on her clothes. All Slovak political parties condemned the incident, except the Slovak National Party, led by J√°n Slota, which remained silent. Police investigation J√°n Packa, the head of Slovak police set up a special squad, and started an investigation immediately. Some two weeks after the incident, police closed the case, concluding that Malina made up the incident. Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Robert Kali≈à√°k declared that none of Malina's claims could be confirmed. Her mobile network operator did not record any call on the day in question. She explained that she had told the police several times that she did not remember whether she had been speaking Hungarian on her phone or to someone in the street. Malina claimed she had been robbed, and her identity papers were later sent to her address. Police claimed that a DNA analysis proved that the parcel had been posted by Malina herself. She gave the parcel to the police only two days after receiving it because of a national holiday. She had licked the stamp in an attempt to fix it back on the envelope after the police had asked her to turn over the entire package. It was later pointed out that at the time of posting the pack she was in hospital. In the hospital, Malina was treated for internal bleeding, which police authorities ascertain occurred before the claimed attack. Graphology specialists assumed that the offensive writings on her clothes were most probably written by herself. However, the specialist did not ask Malina for a sample, but instead used an application for a passport from eight years before that may not have been written by her. By September 2006 the police had concluded their investigation, and at a press conference attended by Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Minister of the Interior Robert Kali≈à√°k, the latter stated \\"it is beyond doubt that the attack did not happen\\", supporting his assertion with several pieces of what he claimed were evidence, including DNA samples. Kali≈à√°k later went on to denounce Malina as a \\"pathological liar\\". Since then, the Slovak authorities ordered her psychiatric examination several times. 10 October 2006 the US Ambassador in Bratislava informed Washington, that \\"A contact with ties to the Ministry of the Interior informed Emboff that the alleged skinhead attack on an ethnic- Hungarian university student in Nitra in August might have happened after all (refs A-C). The young woman may have received a light beating but then tried to make her injuries appear worse than they actually were because she believed that a few punches were \\"not enough\\" to make her case to the police, the source explained.\\"https://wikileaks.org/cable/2006/10/06BRATISLAVA817.html By 2007 the Slovak authorities charged Malina with perjury. In a July 2007 interview with the Slovak Weekly .t√Ω≈æden, Malina said that Robert Fico and Kali≈à√°k initially believed what the police concluded, but later only kept repeating those statements due to outside pressure. She also said that she felt calm and had finished her fourth year at university with an excellent result, so it is not true that she had panicked before a test, and had beaten up herself to evade the exam ‚Äì as stated by Slovak officials. Malina married her Slovak boyfriend Peter ≈Ω√°k in February 2008 after years of being together. They have a daughter and a son.Kisfi√∫nak adott √©letet Malina Hedvig ‚Äì Bumm.sk, 2010. j√∫lius 1. Controversy over the investigation B√©la Bug√°r, then leader of the Party of the Hungarian Coalition (SMK-MKP) questioned the results of the investigation, calling attention to the fact that medical examination initiated by the police did not take place until 10 days after the case, allowing time for bruises to disappear. On 13 September 2006, Malina announced that she was maintaining her initial claims, saying she was willing to take a polygraph test, and that she and her lawyer, G√°bor G√°l were considering reporting the case to public prosecutors because the victim had been interrogated for six hours during which officers tried to persuade her to withdraw her claims. Packa said the attitude of Malina and her lawyer was \\"the despising of the work of Slovak police\\", and Kali≈à√°k claimed that G√°l was trying to make it into a political issue. Hungarian politician Viktor Polg√°r said that the incident was not an isolated case. The following day, G√°l stepped down due to pressure and the whole SMK-MKP for being involved in the case, and gave over the case to a Slovak attorney, Roman Kvasnica. Kvasnica laid a complaint with the Nitra prosecution, which was refused on 18 October 2006. In the meantime, state-owned Slovak television channel STV broadcast a documentary directed by Eugen Korda, which claimed Kali≈à√°k did not always tell the truth in connection with the case. The director was soon after dismissed from the television channel, reportedly for unprofessional behavior. The documentary reported mistakes made by the police and the Ministry of Interior but ‚Äì according to a blog ‚Äì was also biased and contained serious flaws. Polygraph examination In November 2006. Israeli polygraph expert, Koby Rabin conducted an examination to Hedvig Malina. According to the test results Ms. Hedvig Malina did not make up the story regarding the assault in the park and she told the truth when she claimed that the attackers had been shouting that \\"in Slovakia people speak Slovak\\". No indication of lying was detected when she said that neither she, nor anyone on her behalf had written quotes on her blouse saying \\"Hungarians beyond the Danube\\" and \\"Slovakia without parasites\\".{http://img.cas.sk/img/4/full/1026003_hedviga.jpghttp://www.bumm.sk/60233/izraeli- hazugsagvizsgalat-malina-hedvig-igazat-mondott.htmlhttp://www.cas.sk/detektor  Charges against Malina   Kubla report  In November 2006 Juraj Kubla reported Malina to the authorities, accusing her of perjury. At the end of November the police initiated criminal prosecution against Malina, who, in turn, brought the case to the Constitutional Court. In May 2007, Kubla committed suicide. Kubla left behind a suicide note, but the police did not publish it. Hungarian political parties Fidesz and Hungarian Socialist Party called Malina's case a show trial. Zsolt N√©meth noted that the media was informed about the act of accusing before the lawyer of the victim, and the accusation had been announced before it actually took place. Robert Fico called the comments \\"the coarse intervention of Budapest into Slovak domestic matters\\". In June 2007 Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny said that nobody has the right to doubt the independence of justice in another country.  Korcek report  On 26 May 2007 it was revealed that another person besides Kubla reported Malina to the authorities. He was later identified as Peter Korƒçek, a former secret agent and currently a member of the Christian Democratic Movement, a Slovak political party.  A possible witness  In June, Zdeno Kamenick√Ω from Nitra claimed he knew one of the attackers, Robert Benci from Nitra. Kamenick√Ω, due to uncertain reasons, was officially never interrogated by the police, who instead claimed that Benci had a \\"bulletproof alibi.\\" This alibi later turned out to be two contradicting statements from his mother and uncle, who said that Robert at the time was either at home sleeping or at a holiday place with his friends.  A change in view  The next month Packa, the head of the police, contrary to his claims he made one year before, said that \\"Malina might have been beaten.\\" He explained, \\"we never claimed she was not beaten. We claimed it did not happen the way she states.\\" It was also revealed that medical certificates made right after the incident but disregarded by the police did prove Malina's recounting. Du≈°an ƒåaploviƒç, deputy prime minister also accepted that \\"she may have been beaten, but not because she is Hungarian\\". Examinations following the above statements suggested that Malina's handwritten testimony had not been copied accurately in typing, notably, an important sentence had been left out though this was not confirmed by Slovak police. The Chief Prosecutor's Office started an investigation to find out if it was necessary to look into the case again. As a result, Chief Public Prosecutor Dobroslav Trnka admitted that both the police and prosecution had made mistakes without specifying them.  Abuse of power claims  In August 2007, a former high-ranking police officer, Jozef ≈†√°tek, filed a complaint against Fico, Kali≈à√°k and Packa, claiming that they had abused their power in connection with the Malina case. Legal experts noted that the Minister of the Interior, who is not a member of any criminal justice organ, revealed facts from the case file to the public even before the plaintiff had been informed her case had been shelved. The complaint was dropped in September when the police concluded there was no reason to prosecute them.Criminal complaint against Slovak premier dropped. ƒåTK ‚Äì Czech News Agency. 27 September 2007. In September 2007, Chief Prosecutor Trnka decided to replace police investigators working on the case of Malina's alleged perjury and start the investigation again. In October 2007, Tom Lantos, Hungarian-born Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives, asked Prime Minister Fico to distance themselves from the Bene≈° decrees, for a reasonable process in the Malina case, and to treat members of the Hungarian minority as equals. (Press release) Lantos also blamed Fico for creating the climate for anti-Hungarian sentiments by including \\"voluntarily in his coalition individuals with known ultra- nationalist, anti-Hungarian attitudes\\". Lantos said that Fico personally assured him that the Slovak government had a \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy toward all kinds of discrimination. Lantos said he was considering introducing a congressional resolution condemning the ethnic attacks, saying, \\"The blame rests 100 percent with the Slovak side. This is not one of those instances where both sides are guilty.\\" In December 2007, (15 months after the beating) the Slovak police gave the video cassettes about the initial Malina hearing to Roman Kvasnica, her lawyer. It turned out the police had broken the law several times. They forgot to mention three police officers were also in the room throughout the hearing. The investigators stopped the recording at times. The hearing lasted for six hours, but the police recorded only five hours of it, and released only three hours of that recording. Despite the police's early claims not one, but two cameras were used for the recording. Malina is still accused of misleading the authorities for which she may be sentenced to five years in prison. Malina then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, challenging what she calls the \\"inhuman and humiliating\\" conduct of the Slovak officials. She reportedly told the N√©pszabads√°g that she was looking for \\"moral satisfaction.\\" Decision of the European Court of Human Rights Before the tribunal, the Slovak government offered an agreement to the lawyer of Hedvig Malina, in which the Slovak authorities would apologize for their treatment. On 8 November 2011 the European Court of Human Rights approved the Slovak government's apology. The Slovak Government expressed its regret, saying that \\"some elements of Malina's case raised doubts over whether her rights stipulated by the European Convention of Human Rights may have been violated.\\" Despite the apology, the investigation against Malina, started in 2007 is still under way. On 16 December, the police authorities ordered her to undergo psychiatric examination again. At the end of 2013 Malina and her family decided to move to Gy≈ër, northwest Hungary. She commented her decision that she was not fleeing the prosecution procedure and possible court case in Slovakia and added that she just wanted to protect her children from repeated police harassment she had to endure. 4 April 2014, the Slovak Attorney General raised charges against Hedvig Malina. Conspiracy theories Malina was at the centre of several conspiracy theories, which relate the case to the Slovak authorities or nationalists. Radio Slovakia International commented: \\"The victim has become the guilty party, and the question now is whether or not she will be prosecuted herself.

The group is said to have originated from another gang, called the Assyrian Kings. The crime gang was formed by Raymon Youmaran who is now serving a 17-year sentence for the murder of Dimitri DeBaz in 2002. The crime gang has been involved in a number of murders and public shootings, as they established themselves as a major drug dealing and distribution syndicate. Many members sport plenty of ink, including a distinctive clenched fist on their back. NSW police have actively pursued the gang for years, conducting numerous operations that have netted weapons and drugs. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/wetherill-park- shooting-infamous-gang-the-last-hour-gang-linked-death-of-antonio-hermiz/news- story/46748329d73b0e7e3dbb2e8c239cb146 In recent years, gun violence is thought to be part of the gang's turf war over drug supply with its rival gang, The True Kings. The conflict between the two gangs led to a string of drive by shootings and firebombing in the western suburbs of Sydney.https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/bitter-rivalry-fuels- ongoing-civil-war-between-southwest-sydneys-assyrian-kings-and-rivals/news- story/72b0ab4a2fccb68aaa72472379113587 Origins Assyrian organized gangs started appearing in the 1990s with drugs distribution in Sydney's western suburbs. At the time they were known as the Assyrian Kings. In 1997 they were responsible for the killing of police officer David Carty, at the carpark of a Fairfield tavern. Five people were charged for the murder with the main offender receiving a sentence of 30 years.http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-08/police-raids-linked-to- assyrian-crime-gang/5438668 Sefton Playhouse shooting The Assyrian Kings fell apart after Carty's murder, but it was revived by Raphael Joseph and Raymon Youmaran and a number of like-minded criminals in 2000s as DLASTHR. In December 2002 Dimitri Debaz was shot and killed at a strip club in the suburb of Sefton. Raymon umaran became the primary suspect for police and disappeared soon after, as well as another suspect Raphael Joseph who went by the nickname of \\"Hasoni\\". The NSW Police submission described how Joseph, Youmaran and three other men arrived at the Sefton Hotel where Debaz was celebrating his brother Aleck's birthday with about 15 to 20 friends. Within a matter of seconds after entering the hotel a fight between Joseph his co-offenders Dimitri and Aleck Debaz had erupted. Police alleged that the pub's CCTV footage showed Joseph and three accomplices running to their car with Joseph and Youmaran each grabbing a 9mm handgun before fatally shooting Debaz who was standing near the hotel's door. Three shots were fired execution style into the victim's back before the gunmen fled. Sandro Mirad, the driver of Youmaran and Josephs get away car was charged and pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to Debaz's murder. Mirad received a two and a half-year sentence with one and a half-year non-custodial sentence. Youmaran was wanted by police as he went on hiding, there were a number of retaliation attempts on people associated with Youmaran over a period of several years. While in hiding Youmaran was involved in the drug distribution in South Western suburbs of Sydney, and soon became New South Wales 'most wanted man'. 2005 The Rocks double murder On 16, April 2005 at approximately 1:10am Naser Ghaderi and Keyvan Ghajaloo were killed in a drive-by shooting on Hickson Road, The Rocks, Sydney. Reports state that as Ghaderi and Ghajaloo were standing by a car, a BMW and a Volkswagen stopped next to them. The driver of the BMW was reported to have said, \\"Are you the Persians from the party?\\". Following this conversation a hail of bullets from two guns were fired killing Ghaderi and Ghajaloo. Reports also state this was payback from an altercation Ghaderi had two weeks prior at a Persian event. During the coroner's inquest into the murders, Ahmed Alfadly, a non-Assyrian associate of the gang, was named as the opponent Ghaderi had during the altercation at the Persian event 2 weeks prior. Raymon Youmaran and Danny Hirmiz were also identified as possible participants in the killings. Alfadly left Australia for Kuwait five days after the shootings and has never returned. To this day no one has been charged for the murders. Babylon cafe manslaughter In November 2005 the Babylon Cafe in Fairfield, New South Wales was sprayed with bullets, killing bystander Raymond Khananyah and wounding three others. Three gunmen in balaclavas, armed with semi-automatic pistols got out of a black car and fired up to 17 shots into the cafe. It was believed the incident was a case of mistaken identity. The car in the shooting was found later and arrests were made but Youmaran still remained at large. In 2011 a coroner's inquest into the Babylon Cafe shooting revealed in the days before the murder there was a previous shooting and a fight where a firearm was produced. Counsel assisting the Coroner Peter McGrath said police believed the shooting was the work of the local Assyrian gang. McGrath named five men as persons of interest in Khananyah's death including Ramon Youmaran, Steven David, Danny Hurmz, George Hanna, Samer Marcus and Michael Odisho. 2006 Youmaran police escape On 14 February 2006, Youmaran was spotted by police at a house in Woodcroft, Sydney which police had staked out. Youmaran got into the front passenger seat of a green Mercedes at about 6:15pm. Police tailed the Mercedes at speeds of up to 200 km/h across the M2 and M7 motorways, but the pursuit was called off due to safety concerns. The following day, a 24-year-old man believed to be involved in the pursuit was arrested and taken to Green Valley Police Station for questioning. Shortly after detectives seized the Mercedes involved in the pursuit from a home in Cecil Hills. They performed forensic tests on the vehicle. Murder of Audisho On 9 April 2006, 21-year-old Ashoor Audisho was shot and killed in Hamilton Road, Fairfield West. The murder was linked to Youmaran and his gang. Later that year, three men were arrested and were refused bail. Linard Shamouil, a founding member of the crime gang later pleaded guilty to the murder of Audisho. He was sentenced to fourteen years jail. At the time Linard was on bail for attempted murder, which he later was found guilty of and was sentenced to a pre-parole period of nine years. He was also sentenced to a five-year, non-parole period for dealing in methamphetamine. Arrest of Raymon Youmaran In June 2006 Ramon Youmaran was arrested at Mount Pritchard, following a series of police raids on homes in Sydney's western suburbs. He had been in hiding for four years. Police seized 3000 illegal methamphetamine tablets, with a street value of $1.2 million. Seven other high ranking gang members including Linard Shamouil were also arrested. In 2008 Youmaran pleaded guilty to the murder of Debaz and received a minimum of 17 years in jail. Raphael Joseph arrest in the United States Raphael Joseph (also known as Hassoni) was arrested in San Diego in October 2006. Joseph asked American authorities to deport him back to his country of birth, Iraq. Joseph was extradited from the US in February 2008 after fighting to stay there for more than a year. In March 2008 he faced court in Sydney and was charged with the murder of Dimitri Debaz. However the charges were later dropped after Joseph had been imprisoned for nearly 18 months. Joseph's Disappearance On 20 March 2014 Rapahel Joseph disappeared after a meeting in Auburn, New South Wales, and was presumed by police to have been abducted and murdered. Police believe only hours before his abduction, Joseph visited the ex-partner of former Sydney Hells Angel Wayne Schneider, who was abducted and murdered 18 months later. The two were friends who had risen through gang ranks to become major international criminals, each dealing in millions of dollars of drugs. On 20 February 2018 Police believe Mr Joseph was kidnapped and \\"inevitably murdered\\" by a drug syndicate on a rural property in Blaxlands Ridge in Sydney's north-west, police were \\"rewarded with a series of breakthroughs\\" after a car with secret compartments was found on a rural property which was linked with Mr Joseph's disappearance. Police said they believed Mr Joseph's remains could also be located on the property where the vehicle was found.http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/crime/police-discover-secret- compartment-during-search-for-murdered-gangster/news- story/289a2c677e9d4e68aa218cc8d3958443 On 11 Jul 2018, In a surprise move, the NSW Police announced the reward of $1 million in a bid to encourage people to offer up a \\"final piece\\" of information to prosecute those involved in the 2014 murder of Joseph. Police believe people who murdered Joseph were known to them and that he was murdered for financial gain and betrayed by the people he trusted. Police also allege that his body was dumped in a barrel and dissolved in acid.https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/is-one-life-worth-more-than- another-how-police-set-cash-rewards-20180713-p4zrbb.html 2013‚Äìpresent Police raids On 24, September 2013, more than 300 armed Sydney Police undertook 22 raids that \\"severely disrupted\\" the gang. Fifteen suspects were arrested, with four jet skis, a lotus sports car, replica guns and a boat were confiscated by NSW police for the investigation. A high-ranking member and gang coordinator was arrested at the Rossmore property and charged. The criminals faced 29 charges relating to drug provision and possession and being part of a gang. 8 kg of cannabis was found in one of the raids, which were close to $25,000 in cash. In 2014 police arrested three remaining gang members and said that it had dismantled the gang's operations and described the gang as finished. Police had seized $20,000 worth of cannabis from the properties raided. Prison war During simmering religious tensions in 2015, Adnan \\"Eddie'‚Äô Darwiche was stabbed multiple times in Goulburn's maximum security jail by members of the Assyrian gang. Its believed that Muslim gang members had been planning to take extremist action against those who oppose their religion. In a pre-emptive strike, the Assyrians struck first, in a daylight attack which happened in front of four prison guards. Darwiche was stabbed eight times by two inmates who used prison knife made from a toilet brush and a sandwich toaster handle. Prison intel said the attack was due to the Muslims versus Christians war that is going on in the prison.https://www.theherald.com.au/story/4085981/jailhouse-payback/ In August 2016, in retaliation to the stabbing of Darwiche, who was moved to Cessnock prison after being attacked, Fadi \\"Ricky\\" Shamoun was stabbed by Darwiche and another inmate in his prison cell as payback. Shamoun was stabbed multiple times to his forearms, body and back of the head, with an aluminum window frame sharpened into a knife. Shamoun was not seriously wounded, and was back in jail the same day. Shamoun who has close ties to the Assyrian gang, is serving a minimum 27-year sentence for murder, over a business dispute.http://www.newslocker.com/en-au/region/cessnock/double-killer-adnan- eddie-darwiche-stabs-murderer-fadi-ricky-shamoun-in-cessnock-jail-the-sydney- morning-herald/view/ Rival gang In 2016, conflict between DLASTHR and a young breakaway group known as \\"True Kings\\", resulted in Drive by shootings, fire bombings and intimidation, as tensions over drug supply erupted between the two gangs. On 11, May 2016 police arrested and charged three gang members with shoot with intent to murder, over an incident occurring in Edensor Park. Police alleged that 3 gang members shot at a car driven by the rival group \\"True Kings\\". While the passenger managed to escape, one man was trapped inside the car and was approached by a gang member who allegedly attempted to shoot at him, but the weapon did not fire. Samer Marcus, Danny Hanna, George Hanna, were arrested and appeared before Fairfield Local Court and charged with shooting with intent to murder.https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real- life/true-stories/four-shootings-in-two-weeks-and-a-gang-war-on-the-rise- inside-australias-most-dangerous-suburb/news- story/b5df1aa69cf2f4d1d2c884760e315745 On August 2016, one of the associates of the gang were charged over attempted murder of a 14-year-old at Fairfield railway station. The boy, who survived the attack, was found bleeding with multiple stab wounds. On 17 October 2018, a conviction of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was announced. Park shooting & murder of Buxton On 24 December 2016, 20-year-old Antonio Hermiz, was shot dead at Lizard Log park Wetherill Park. 18-year-old, Ronaldo Odisho, was wounded at the same time. The pair were sitting inside their vehicle at the popular Park, when another car approached. Witnesses saw two groups of males arguing before shots were fired. The two men were both known to police and had ties to the gang. Earlier that same year, Ex-Nomads bikie gang member Adrian Buxton was shot dead outside his home on 17 May 2016. After the murder of Mr Hermiz, police investigation lead them to believe that DLASTHR group was responsible for the murder of Mr Buxton, but varying theories for the motive are yet to be solidified with evidence. Police seized a car, a .32 calibre pistol and a 357 Magnum at a house in Cabramatta where two gang members were arrested in September 2016. Police believe both were used to murder Mr Buxton. Ballistic examinations concluded that the weapon was used to murder Mr Buxton. It's understood that Mr Hermiz was trying to hide an Audi Q7 used in the murder of Adrian Buxton, before he was murdered at the Lizard Log Park, but police are yet to find the car. Police suggest that Mr Buxton was having an affair with someone linked to a member of DLASTHR, or that a payment was made for a professional hit on Mr Buxton or that he was killed for his links to outlaw motorcycle gang.http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-underworld-murder-we-are- looking-in-the-right-pool-we-just-have-to-find-the-right- fish-20170119-gtuu2a.html Police would not say if Mr Hermiz was directly involved in the murder or what his role was, including disposing of the getaway car.

Investigators seized cannabis, cash, mobile phones, SIM cards, clothing and drug paraphernalia in raids of seven homes in Fairfield, Cabramatta West, Smithfield and Elizabeth Hills. Antal and Mr Merza, were both charged with recruiting young teenage boys, and acting with intent to pervert the course of justice.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/fairfield-advance/a-couple- have-been-charged-with-recruiting-young-teenage-boys-to-run-drugs/news- story/ee13a976109c008a1fa53bb3d9135df0 Gold Coast branch In March 2017, police discovered that the Assyrian crime gang was operating from Queensland's Gold coast with drug distribution in the area. Police arrested and charged Kris Mircevski, with more than 30 drugs charges. police allege Mircevski was operating in the Gold coast for a number of years, and that many gang members were visiting the Gold Coast on a regular basis. Police also allege that the gang was assisting outlaw motorcycle gangs with the distribution of drugs and weapons.https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/crime-court/gold-coast- police-say-theyve-uncovered-local-branch-of-notorious-middle-eastern- gang/news-story/44af814da291f6a1a7af9e3f9b9fa951 Response NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Frank Mennilli confessed that getting information from relatives and associates of the gang affiliates is the most vital aspect, stating, \\"If ever there is to be a message, it is to the family and friends of the people involved in crime. If you want to help ... to do the right thing then ‚Äì it's about telling the police\\". The hesitancy to come forward has thwarted recent police efforts to put a stop to the rising gang-related crime in Fairfield in 2016. He described the gang as \\"a criminal group that have made thousands upon thousands of dollars through their criminal activities\\" and \\"have been involved in public place shootings, in murders, and have been a criminal enterprise within the south west of Sydney.\\" He concluded, \\"The New South Wales police force will not rest until we put each and every one of these criminals behind bars and we smashed this particular operation.http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/new-police-operation-to-stamp-out-street- gang-violence-in-sydneys-west-20160726-gqe6ig.html References External links *Aliraqi.org *Smh.com.au *Firearmcrime.blogspot.com Category:Assyrian Australian Category:Assyrian gangs Category:Crime in Sydney Category:Gangs in Australia Category:Street gangs Category:1997 establishments in Australia Category:Organizations established in 1997 ","title":"DLASTHR"},{"id":"13142878","text":"Mandelshagen is a village and a former municipality in the Rostock district, in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.

The sit-in at Memorial Square in Taipei (since rededicated as Liberty Square in commemoration of the movement) was initiated by students from National Taiwan University. Participation quickly grew to 22,000 demonstrators.Linda Chao & Ramon H. Myers, 1998. The First Chinese Democracy: Political Life in the Republic of China on Taiwan. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 192. The Wild Lily demonstrators sought direct elections of Taiwan's president and vice president and new popular elections for all representatives in the National Assembly. The demonstration lasted from March 16 to March 22, 1990, coinciding with the inauguration of Lee Teng- hui on March 21 to a six-year term as president. The election Lee won was one in which only the 671 members of the National Assembly voted, only one party was recognized, and one candidate ran. This process had been characteristic of one-party rule under the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek. Protesters wore white Formosa lilies and created giant replicas of the flower as a symbol of democracy. Their adoption of the flower as an icon of freedom evoked a long native tradition. Yang Yung-ming, a professor of political science at the National Taiwan University, described it to the Taiwan Review in 2003: > For years, Taiwanese poets have employed this flower as a symbol of grace > and resilience. The aboriginal poet Lin Yi-te, for example, often used it to > symbolize the Taiwanese indigenous peoples' primitive purity of spirit, and > used the flower's decline to dramatize the desolation and tragedy of their > decline. It was Taiwanese literature's use of this wild lily as a metaphor > of simplicity and fortitude that inspired its use by those in the student > democracy movement. On the first day of his new term, Lee Teng-hui welcomed fifty students to the Presidential Building. He expressed his support of the students' goals and promised full democracy in Taiwan beginning with reforms to be initiated that summer. The Wild Lily student movement marked a crucial turning point in Taiwan's transition to pluralistic democracy. Six years later, Lee became Taiwan's first popularly elected leader, taking 54% of the vote in an election in which over 95% of eligible voters participated. Democracy supporters continue to gather at Liberty Square every March 21 to commemorate the event. Officials affiliated with the Taiwan Solidarity Union have advocated the movement of Taiwan's Youth Day to March 21 in recognition of the students' achievement. On the eve of the fifteenth anniversary of the ill-fated student democracy protests in China's Tiananmen Square, Lee's successor Chen Shui-bian noted that the Wild Lily student movement had taken place only a year after the events in Beijing. He noted the contrast in the way the governments responded. \\"The most memorable impression of the Tiananmen incident of June 4th is that of that small, thin person holding up a line of tanks, which was a heroic and disturbing impression,\\" he said. \\"The March Student Movement, in pressing for the establishment of a national affairs conference, changing the way the Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly are elected and a consensus on realizing the direct election of the president, also set a timetable for reform.\\" Today, Taiwan's national leaders are popularly elected and multiple political parties are legal. The National Assembly voted to dissolve itself in 2005. See also * Wild Strawberries Movement * Sunflower Student Movement *1989 Tiananmen Square protests References *'Taipei Spring?

Details The Hafthohlladung (lit. \\"adhesive hollow charge\\") was primarily used by Wehrmacht tank killer squads. Designed with three magnets at the base, each with a pair of poles creating a strong magnetic field across their gap, an infantryman could attach it to an enemy's tank no matter the angle of the surface. As the blast axis should be flush and perpendicular to the plane of the armour at the point of placement, and armed by pulling the igniter on the rear of the mine, the degree of a tank's sloped armour was irrelevant for the device's penetration. However, this required direct placement made use of the device very dangerous, since the deploying infantryman placing it on an enemy fighting vehicle would be highly vulnerable to enemy fire. The Hafthohlladung device was very effective against armour, able to penetrate 140 mm of rolled homogeneous armour (RHA).

Middleton was, in 1086, a berewick (a supporting farm) of the town and manor of Wirksworth. Middleton was formerly known for its lead mines and high quality limestone quarries, including the underground quarry site at Middleton Mine. The Middleton Mine networks underground for approximately with tunnels on three different levels running under Middleton Moor to the Hopton Wood quarry works at the other side of the hill below Ryder Point Works‚Äô. Part of the tunnel collapsed in the 1980s leaving a noticeable depression in the ground above on the eastern side of Middleton Moor. The population of the parish as taken at the 2011 Census was 775. The attraction towards Middleton becoming a village had much to do with the fact that it is one of the few Derbyshire villages in the limestone area that has a ‚Äòperched‚Äô water table due to the impervious volcanic rock and shale formations within its topology. The availability of water was the incentive behind it becoming a choice of settlement. Middleton formed originally in the Saxon times as a small farming hamlet which settled around a very high spring. The former Cromford and High Peak Railway passes close by the village. The local quarries were linked to this line by a short branch spur, Killer's Branch, part of which now forms the track bed of the Steeple Grange Light Railway. The branch line was operational until the late 1960s. In the 1970s, the disused track bed of the Cromford and High Peak Railway and some surrounding land were purchased by the Derbyshire County Council and the Peak Park Planning Board, who then worked collaboratively to turn the former railway into the High Peak Trail for walkers and cyclists. Middleton Top lies near the southern end of the trail, which starts at High Peak Junction. There is a car park and visitor centre at Middleton Top, where cycles may be hired. Middleton Top Engine House () houses a preserved steam engine formerly used to haul trains up the long 1-in-8 (12.5%) gradient of Middleton Incline. The engine, built by the Butterley Company of Ripley in 1829, still runs for demonstration purposes and is occasionally open to the public. The northern part of the village on the west side of the main road out towards New Road is called 'The Hall' due to the location of the now demolished Middleton Hall. The cold winter of 1947 combined with the exposed nature of Middleton meant that snow was present even during the summer following the heavy snowfall. Middleton is dependent on the market town of Wirksworth for many of its services, such as its health centre, leisure centre, high school (the Anthony Gell School) and nearby shops, petrol and so on. The closest railway station to Middleton is Wirksworth on the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway. Literary connection In 1918-19, D. H. Lawrence and his wife Frieda rented Mountain Cottage, which stands below the B5023 road on the NW side of village as the road descends towards the Via Gellia. Lawrence also reputedly spent time at Woodland Cottage (formerly known as The Woodlands) on the opposite side of New Road. While living in Middleton during the bitter winter of 1918-19, Lawrence wrote the short story A Wintry Peacock (published in 1921), which is set in the immediate locality.

Awards criteria and history Works are judged on their overall effect within the horror genre based on the author's skill, delivery, and the work's lasting resonance. Each year, a director is appointed by the AHWA to administer the award. Shortlists for each category are determined by a panel of judges, and the shortlisted nominees are announced in March/April every year. From 2005 to 2008, the Australian Shadows Award evaluated novels, anthologies, and short stories against each other in a single category. In 2009, the award was expanded into three categories: Short Fiction, Long Fiction, and Edited Publication. From 2011, the award was restructured to consist of five categories: Novel; Long Fiction (novellas and novelettes); Short Fiction (short stories); Collection (single author collections); and Edited Publication (anthologies and magazine issues). In 2013, the 'Long Fiction' award category was renamed 'Paul Haines Award for Long Fiction' in honour of New Zealand/Australian author Paul Haines. The Australian Shadows Awards were sponsored by Altair Australia Books in its first two years, through the donation of two statuettes created by dark fantasy artist Brom (supplied by The Franklin Mint). Currently, winners of the awards receive a hand crafted trophy from the masters of the horror special effects industry, Nightshade FX. Winners and nominees In the below list, the years correspond to the year of the book's eligibility; the awards are always announced the following year. If the short story was originally published in an anthology with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the anthology title and anthology publisher's name is included. 2005 Judges * Guest judge: Kim Wilkins * Award Director: Marty Young Winner * \\"Father Muerte and the Flesh\\", Lee Battersby, Aurealis #36 Nominees * \\"Pater Familias\\", Lee Battersby, Shadowed Realms #3 * Shadow Box, Shane Jiraiya Cummings & Angela Challis (eds) (Brimstone Press) * \\"The Red Priest's Homecoming\\", Dirk Flinthart, Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine #17 * The Grinding House, Kaaron Warren (CSFG Publishing) 2006 Judges * Judging panel: David Schembri, Miranda Siemienowicz, Mark Smith-Briggs * Guest judge: Robert Hood * Award Director: Marty Young Winner * The Pilo Family Circus, Will Elliott (ABC Books) Nominees * \\"Father Renoir's Hands\\", Lee Battersby, Through Soft Air (Prime Books) * \\"The Dying Light\\", Deborah Biancotti, Eidolon I (Eidolon Books) * \\"The Blow- Off\\", Stephen Dedman, Brutarian #47 * \\"The Bridal Bier\\", Carol Ryles, Eidolon I (Eidolon Books) Honourable mentions * \\"Silk and Pearls\\", K.

The mention involved the church at D√§nschenburg which was described as a daughter church of Sanitz. A subsequent mention occurs in an agreement of 2 June 1291 involving Henry I of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow, at the time the local Bishop, who granted the lordship of the Rostock region to his ward Nicholas whose own heirs would retain these privileges. In the fourteenth century Sanitz is recorded as having been held by asuccession of vassals such as Bernard Kopmann from Rostock, the knight Siegfried of Pl√∂n, Reimar von Wedel, the Rostock council member Dietrich Horn, along with his son, the major Dippold Horn. After this the village was inherited by the Cistercian monastery at Doberan who held it until the Reformation. In 1552 the monastery fell victim to a programme of Secularization in the area and the village was transferred as a ducal domain to Robnitz and thereafter leased out to various land owning families. In 1879 the village passed into the control of nearby Toitenwinkel.Friedrich Schlie: Kunst- und Geschichtsdenkm√§ler Mecklenburgs, 1899, S. 425-431 Famous sons and daughters *Friedrich von Flotow (1812 - 1883), the composer, was born in Teutendorf, which subsequently became a district of Sanitz. *Helga Radtke (b 1962), the athlete, was born at Sanitz References Category:Bezirk Rostock ","title":"Sanitz"},{"id":"13142935","text":"Selpin is a municipality in the Rostock district, in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.

Located in the Beit She'an Valley on the Jordan River and to the south of the Sea of Galilee, it falls under the jurisdiction of Valley of Springs Regional Council. In it had a population of . It is named after the Biblical town of Ur Kasdim in Mesopotamia, where Abraham lived, before he left for the land of Israel (Canaan) (). Geography Neve Ur is located in the northern Jordan Valley in the Beit She'an region approximately 10 km north of the town of Beit She'an, and 15 km south of the Sea of Galilee.Dawn of the Metal Age: Technology and Society During the Levantine Chalcolithic By Jonathan M. Golden, pages 16-17 Highway 90 runs through the Beit She'an Valley past Neve Ur. The kibbutz and its building lay to the east of the road. On the west side of the highway, and some 500 meters above, overlooking its hillside citrus groves, is the most complete Crusader fortress in Israel, Belvoir Fortress. The Hebrew name of the fortress is Kokhav HaYarden (lit. Star of the Jordan), for the nearby ancient Jewish village of Kokhav (star). When the site was restored by the National Parks Authority, they found that many of the stones used in building it had been brought up from a 3rd-century CE synagogue the Jewish town of Kochav, 700 m. lower down and southeast of the fortress. Muslims call it Kaukab al-Hawa (Arabic: lit. Star of the Winds), and the Crusaders named it Belvoir (French: lit. Fair or Beautiful View). The fortress was built overlooking the most important crossings on the river, including Naharayim (lit. Two Rivers)The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700 By Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, pages 209-210 History Israel sought to establish a line of security settlements along the Jordan river, from the Sea of Galilee to Beit She'an, in order to protect its borders. Neve Ur was established opposite the Jordan River from the town of Tel esh-Shuneh.Kibbutz Shields Israeli Children From Guerrillas By ABRAHAM RABINOVICH, Special to the Sun- Sentinel, 12 May 1991 Neve Ur was established in 1948, and first settled in 1949 by immigrants from Iraq, including Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino. The hardships they faced forced them to abandon the kibbutz. They were replaced by a group of young pioneers and volunteers. In 1952 a group of immigrants from Hungary and Poland joined the established group in Neve Ur. Mesolithic and Natufian remains were excavated in Neve Ur.Encyclopaedia Judaica, Volume 15 By Fred Skolnik, Michael Berenbaum, page 782The Jordan Valley Survey, 1953 By Albert Leonard, James Mellaart, pages 6-8 As the kibbutz was located near the Jordanian border, it was extremely vulnerable to attacks by Palestinian fedayeen who would cross into Israel from Jordan. During the War of Attrition, Neve Ur was hit almost daily by shellings and gunfire, aimed mainly at the workers in the fields. In April 1991, a group of Hamas militants penetrated the defences of the kibbutz and killed one member who was working in the orchard, and wounded three others.Daily Report: Near East & South Asia - Page 30 Economy The kibbutz primarily grows citrus fruits, including pomelo, lemon, orange, red grapefruit, and raises chickens and turkeys. The kibbutz is also known for its large dairy production, and fish ponds.Aquaculture Magazine, 1994, pages 93-94 Like many kibbutzim, Neve Ur has welcomed volunteer workers from around the world, who provide additional help at harvest time, and also added to the workforce in the refet (dairy), chicken and turkey houses. The collapse of a viable future for kibbutzim as agricultural communities meant that kibbutzim, like Neve Ur, had to turn to small industry as the means to avoid economic collapse. The Israel government, which had provided tax breaks to the agricultural communities, and which owned much of the land occupied by the kibbutzim, had to rewrite the definition of a kibbutz in order to support the shift from farming to industry and outside employment. With the economic upheaval suffered across the Kibbutz Movement, Neve Ur entered the industrial market, founding an aluminum, magnesium and zinc casting foundry. Industries in the kibbutz include agriculture, fish ponds, dairy farming and a casting foundry for the automotive industry.

One covered a gate to Hades, abode of the dead; Festus called it ostium Orci, \\"the gate of Orcus\\". The other was used to make rain; this one may have no direct relationship with the Manes, but is instead derived from the verb manare, \\"to flow\\". The two stones had the same name. However, the grammarian Festus held the cover to the gate of the underworld and the rainmaking stone to be two distinct stones.Sextus Pompeius Festus, De verborum significatione, sub. tit. manalis (Latin and French text) Gate to the underworld Plutarch linked the Roman mundus to the religious center of the city of Rome, the umbilicus urbis Romae. One such stone covered the mundus Cereris, a pit thought to contain an entrance to the underworld. Most cities of Latium and Etruria contained a similar pit or ditch; Plutarch describes the custom of a mundus as being of Etruscan origin, and states that it was used as a place where first-fruits were deposited.Plutarch, Life of Romulus ch. 11. The Latin word mundus meant \\"world\\". Festus, quoting Cato this time, explains that: The Roman mundus was located in the Comitium.Plutarch, supra. This stone was ceremonially opened three times a year, during which spirits of the blessed dead (the Manes) were able to commune with the living. The three days upon which the mundus was opened were August 24, October 5, and November 8. Fruits of the harvest were offered to the dead at this time.Lesley Adkins and Roy A. Adkins, Dictionary of Roman Religion (Facts on File, 1996) Fowler, above Macrobius, quoting Varro, says of these days that: Accordingly, he reports that military and public matters were not transacted upon them, even though they were not dies nefasti.Macrobius, Saturnalia I 16.18 Charm to make rain The other was used as part of a ceremony called the aquaelicium (Latin: \\"calling the waters\\") which sought to produce rain in times of drought.Sir James Frazer, The Golden Bough ch. 5, \\"Magical Control of the Weather\\" (Abridged edition, MacMillan, 1922) During the ceremony, the pontifices had the stone brought from its usual resting place, the Temple of Mars in Clivo near the Porta Capena, into the Senate. Offerings were made to Jupiter petitioning for rain, and water was ceremonially poured over the stone.Cyril Bailey, The Religion of Ancient Rome, ch. 2 (Archibald, Constable & Co., London, 1907) See also *Lemuria, another Roman festival for the dead. *Lemures, hostile ghosts in Roman mythology.

Retrieved on May 14, 2017.  Background  Russell was born in Fayette City, Pennsylvania, on October 1, 1918, the son of James Walch \\"Doc\\" Russell and Lillian Johnson. Russell never finished high school, but instead went out to work mines to bolster his family's financial situation. Jim played baseball with rocks (for balls) and tree limbs (for bats) in alleyways when he was a youngster. As a youth, he contracted rheumatic fever twice; his baseball career would be shortened because of his rheumatic heart disease.  Baseball career  Russell, a switch hitter who threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed After beginning his minor league career in 1937, his contract was bought by the Pittsburgh Pirates in September 1942. In , Russell led the Pirates in hitting with a .312 batting average and 181 total hits, and hit the first pinch-hit home run in Pirates history on August 20. Russell was traded in November 1947 to the Boston Braves in a five-player transaction that included Danny Murtaugh, Johnny Hopp and Bill Salkeld. He was the pennant- winning Braves' regular center fielder in , starting 80 of Boston's 98 games played through early August. But then he was stricken with bacterial endocarditis brought on by the rheumatic fever he had as a child. It cost him the rest of the season and a chance to play in the 1948 World Series. He was able to play again for the Braves in , but the heart problem slowly degraded his ability, as he had a .231 batting average. In 1952 and 1953, he returned to the minor leagues. As a big-leaguer, Russell appeared in 1,035 games played over his ten-season career and batted .267 with 428 RBI. His 959 hits included 175 doubles, 51 triples and 67 home runs. Defensively, he recorded a .981 fielding percentage. From 1954 until 1965, he scouted for the Dodgers and Senators.

St. Mary's College (Juvenate) was established by the church's Ecclesiastical Province of Toronto in 1918 when campus construction took place. The date of canonical erection was September 5, 1920. The school functioned as a preparatory college for students initially drawn from Montreal, Prescott and Kirkwood, Missouri under its first Rector, The Reverend Charles Kelz. For the next 50 years, aside from the juvenate closing temporarily from 1941-1944 because of World War II, St. Mary's College educated nearly 550 boys, constituting nearly every English- speaking Redemptorist in Canada as part of the initial stage in the formation process of training for the priesthood. St. Mary's College was the First Novitiate for Chorists and Laybrothers from 1944-1947 and it reopened as a juvenate in 1947 and operated as such until its last class graduated in June 1968. One of the primary reasons for declining enrollment at St. Mary's was a 1960 decision by the Ecclesiastical Province of Edmonton to establish a junior seminary, Holy Redeemer College, for training western candidates. The date of canonical suppression at St. Mary's College is January 21, 1969. The school's campus and buildings were sold later that year to a group called Berean Christian Schools who hoped to use the facility as a private school. In 1975, the campus evolved into a private university preparatory school called Grenville Christian College.

J. Daniels. The bridge was closed to traffic in 1967. It had been built to replace two prior open wooden bridges that had fallen in. After its destruction by fire, it was replaced in 2006 by a reproduction. First bridge About 1823, Kockwood and Silliman built the first mill, in the location that would develop a bad reputation and often be referred to as \\"Sodom\\", on Big Raccoon Creek. Later, in an attempt to change the town's reputation, the town would become Bridgeton after the earlier bridge. The first mill was owned by Oniel and Wasson and later be bought by James Searing. From 1850 to 1860, James A. Rea would run the mill. In 1862, the mill would change hands to Ralph Sprague and burn down in 1869. James Rea would go on to rebuild the mill in 1871, and Joseph Cole would operate it. Daniel Webster bought it in 1882, and sold it to P.T. Winney in 1889. The mill would not change hands again until June 1914, when George Brake and Fred Mitchell purchased it. According to Mr. Brake, the south half of the dam was built in 1913, with the remaining half finished in 1916. The dam is constructed of concrete and is long and high. Note: This includes , Site map, and Accompanying photographs. The first bridge to be built was of open design with wood rails and piers. While crossing the first bridge Owen Wimmer and his family were dropped into the mill pond along with their wagon and team when the bridge fell in. J.H. Kerr and others were able to rescue them. A second bridge of similar construction was erected at the same site. This bridge fell in also just after J.H. Kerr had driven cattle across. The covered bridge was then built in 1868, at the same location, just above the mill dam, with the abutments attached to the dam structure. Three people submitted bids in 1868, for the contract to build the bridge, these bids would include three different styles of bridges. One bid was from a Mr. Epperson using an Howe Plan for $16,000. Wheelock and McCoy submitted two plans, one was to use a Burr Plan for $17,400 and the second using a Smith Plan for $10,200. Ultimately the bid was awarded to J. J. Daniels and his Burr Plan for $10,200. The \\"Daniels Portals\\" were to be later squared off and, after the bridge's closing in 1967, to traffic, benches and steps were added at the portals. The present mill has been converted to run on electric power. Robert Weis and the Weis Milling Company operated the mill until 1995 when it was purchased by Mike Roe. The current owner has restored the mill and produces over 20 different milled products. The bridge was destroyed by arson on April 28, 2005. Jesse Payne was taken into custody near the Mansfield Covered Bridge a short time later.

The name of the label was a pun derived from disc and the Compatible Discrete 4 process of encoding quadraphonic sound signals into phonograph records. The label was launched in January 1973 when DiscReet arranged a distribution contract with the Warner Bros. Records group of labels. The previous Zappa/Cohen labels, Bizarre Records and Straight Records, were discontinued at the same time that DiscReet was created. DiscReet issued many albums by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention between 1973 and 1979. Another notable act on the label was Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes, who recorded their final two albums for DiscReet. Following this Ted Nugent began his solo career. Cohen also brought to the label recordings by other artists such as Tim Buckley. Zappa's original intention was to release all albums on the label in conventional 2-channel stereo and 4-channel quadraphonic sound simultaneously. DiscReet issued two albums specially remixed for quadraphonic during 1973. These were Over-Nite Sensation credited to Frank Zappa and the Mothers and Apostrophe (') credited to Zappa alone. But the quadraphonic policy had to be dropped after just two releases. Also advertised were quadraphonic versions of two other Zappa titles. These were the double live album from 1974, Roxy & Elsewhere, and the 1975 (mostly) studio album One Size Fits All. The four- channel master tapes for these albums exist in the Zappa archives, but the quadraphonic versions have never been issued. In 1976, Zappa's business partnership with Cohen soured and ended in litigation. At the same time, Zappa also had disagreements with Warner Bros. Records; the DiscReet label was abandoned in 1979 following the decision by Warner Bros. to release three albums for which Zappa claimed Warner Bros. did not have proper authorization, Studio Tan, Sleep Dirt, and Orchestral Favorites. The three disputed titles had no songwriting or production credits and used artwork by Gary Panter, which was not approved by Zappa. Warner Bros. reissued Zappa's DiscReet recordings on the Reprise Records subsidiary in the late 1970s; they were deleted in 1982. Zappa created Zappa Records in 1979 and Barking Pumpkin Records in 1981; these labels had no involvement with Cohen and were separate business entities from DiscReet. In 1988 and 1989, DiscReet recordings by Tim Buckley and Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes were briefly re-issued on CD and cassette by the Enigma Retro label. From the late 1980s until 2012, Zappa's DiscReet catalog had been available on CD from Rykodisc. In 2012, the Zappa Family Trust regained the rights to Zappa's DiscReet catalog and signed a new distribution agreement with Universal Music Enterprises to reissue the recordings on the Zappa Records label.

The film became extremely popular, and some critics consider it the only Estonian cult film.Sulev Teinemaa: \\"Viimne reliikvia\\" kolmk√ºmmend aastat hiljem  Setting  The movie is set during a Livonian War era peasant uprising. A central plot device is the Pirita monastery, a real monastery dedicated to St. Brigitta. Currently, the monastery's original medieval buildings lie in ruins and are kept that way as a museum, but an organisational structure, complete with nuns, was restored after the end of Soviet occupation.  Movie sets  Scenes for the movie were recorded in Tallinn Old Town, passages of the Dominican monastery of Tallinn, Taevaskoja, as well as other places. A mock monastery was built in Kukerand, near Virtsu. Several outdoors scenes were taken in Latvia, near the Gauja river. Indoors scenes were, among other places, taken in the fortress of Kuressaare and the Tallinn church of St. Nicholas.  Success  A typical live action movie of the era had a standardised budget of 350,000 roubles. As a special case, the team of Viimne reliikvia managed to haggle themselves a budget of 750,000 roubles ‚Äî more than double the customary. This lavishness paid off very well, as within the very first year, 772,000 tickets were sold in Estonia only. (Remarkably, Estonia's population at that time was around 1,300,000.) The movie set the absolute box office record for the entire Soviet Union in 1971 by selling 44.9 million tickets.Bridging the Cultural Divide By Sigrid Rieuwerts; p. 325Box office for Viimne reliikvia @ IMDB It was distributed by the Soviet film export internationally in more than 60 countries.  Russian version  A Russian language version was dubbed by the Mosfilm studio. It is 89 minutes in length.  Digital  In 2000, the Estonian Film Foundation and Tallinnfilm determined Viimne reliikvia to be an important part of Estonian cultural heritage, and in order to preserve it, undertook a digital remastering. This became the first digitally remastered Estonian movie; others followed. The digital copy was re-launched on 15 March 2002, and again, became a bestseller. As of 2007, the remastered movie is available on DVD.  Cultural influence  The movie became extremely influential, and as such, has been repeatedly lampooned. As one notable example, in 1992, during the early capitalism developing in the aftermath of perestroika, Ivar Vigla prepared a brief parody for Wigla Show, featuring quotes such as \\"We don't get paid for chitchat\\" () and \\"What will become of us? ‚Äî A joint venture.\\" () Many of these parody quotes became independently popular, and then, in turn, became lampooned in other venues, such as the Ugala Theatre's production of The Love for Three Oranges.Transcript of Vigla's parody Also, several parodies of the movie's songs have been circulated in the Internet.

A descendant of both Northern Dancer and Secretariat, The Green Monkey was sold in 2006 as a two-year-old colt for the highest price ever paid (current to 2020) at auction for a Thoroughbred‚Äî$16,000,000. Background The Green Monkey, a bay colt with a white blaze and two white socks, was foaled on February 4, 2004. He was sired by Gr.I winner Forestry, and was out of the Unbridled mare Magical Masquerade. At the January 2006 Fasig-Tipton Calder sale of selected two-year-olds, The Green Monkey was sold for a world- record auction price of $16 million (equal to about $ million today). He joins nine other descendants of Northern Dancer who clinch the entire list of the ten most expensive colts sold at auction (current to 2014). The colt's new owners gave him the name because of their connections with The Green Monkey golf course in Barbados, named after the island's green monkeys. The colt was also foaled in the Chinese year of the green/wooden monkey. Racing career On September 15, 2007, The Green Monkey made his racing debut in a six-furlong maiden race at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. Made the 2‚Äì5 betting favorite, the colt finished third behind winner Roi Maudit and runner-up Sixthirteen. The Green Monkey made the second start of his career at Belmont Park on October 13 in a seven-furlong race for nonwinners. In a field of seven, he finished a well-beaten fourth to winner Giant Deputy in a time of 1:21.20. The Green Monkey was officially retired February 12, 2008 after failing to break his maiden in his three career starts. Stud Record and Death A portion of his ownership was acquired by the same pinhook sellers, Randy Hartley and Dean De Renzo, who originally acquired and sold him at auction in the 2006 Fasig-Tipton Calder sale. Hartley and De Renzo bought back into the horse with partner John Magnier (Coolmore Stud). He entered stud at their Hartley/De Renzo Thoroughbreds in Ocala beginning in 2009. His initial stud fee was set at $5,000. The first reported foal by The Green Monkey was a filly born January 13, 2010. The newborn, bred by Jacqueline Fleck, is the third foal out of multiple winner I‚Äôm Angela (by Kayrawan). The filly, later named Your Lovely, was a winner. The Green Monkey was not a success as a stallion. His best progeny include 2015 Panama Triple Crown winner Monkey Business, and North American blacktype winners Kinz Funky Munky and Green Doctor. The Green Monkey was euthanized in May 2018 at Hartley/DeRenzo Thoroughbreds due to laminitis. ‚ÄúHe was doing excellent (sic), and then probably a year and a half ago, he foundered,‚Äù said farm co-owner Randy Hartley. ‚ÄúWe just struggled with him ever since, trying to do everything we could to get him right. It just got to the point where it wasn't the right thing to do.‚Äù ‚ÄúNobody will have his stall or anything, it's a special place,‚Äù said Hartley. ‚ÄúThere will never be another horse like him for us. I thank the lord for him.‚Äù The Green Monkey was laid to rest on the farm.

Flowriding takes place on an artificial wave called the FlowRider or the FlowBarrel. These waves were created by WaveLoch Inc. The FlowRider and the FlowBarrel are artificial waves that are called \\"sheet waves\\". In order to create a sheet wave, water is pumped up and over a surface which is engineered to replicate the shape of an ocean wave. The result is a stationary wave in which a rider can mimic the movements of other board sports, such as moving up and down the wave, carving, and jumping. Since the wave does not move forward, the riders movement is derived from the water flowing over the stationary surface. There are seven different types of sheet waves that can be used for flowriding however the two main wave structures which are recognized at a competitive level are the FlowRider Single and Double and the FlowBarrel. The sport has two different types of boards that a rider can choose to ride on. These are the flowboard and the bodyboard. WaveLoch Inc. created the idea of the Wave House which is an entertainment venue based around their artificial wave technology. In the early 2000s, the Flowriding League Of The World (FLOW) tour was established which hosts a World Championship event each year.  History of Flowriding  Although the first artificial waves in a pool were developed back in the 19th century by King Ludwig of Bavaria, they required a completely different technology from that of flowriding. The activity of flowriding is closely associated with ‚ÄúFlowRider‚Äù, a technology created by Tom Lochtefeld, founder of WaveLoch Inc. that shoots more than 60,000 gallons of water per second, with a speed of 32km/h to 48km/h on a padded, inclined surface. At full capacity, 100,000 gallons of water per minute can amount to waves as high as 6 feet. With this technology, flowriders, those who lie, kneel or stand on a board, attempt to balance on these artificial waves, called sheet waves, and more professional riders seek to perform tricks. In 1987, Lochtefeld was inspired to create this technology when he observed waters seemingly flowing up a wave in La Jolla. It seemed that the wave was travelling backward. A second inspiration came to him when he saw surfers ride shallow waves without touching the ocean floor. The upward motion of water through a shallow wave then became the essence of the Flowrider, shooting a thin sheet of water up a curved surface. To perfect this design, Lochtefeld hired Carl Ekstrom, known for his surfboard designs, to create the perfect, easy-to-ride, continuous waves. After multiple trials on miniature FlowRiders, in the 1980s, Lochtefeld started testing a FlowRider prototype at Raging Waters water parks. In 1991, the first FlowRider machine was successfully installed at The Schlitterbahn in New Braunfels, Texas. Along with this success, a new type of FlowRider, the ‚ÄúFlowBarrel‚Äù was unveiled at Summerland Resort, in B√∏, Norway in 1993 and received instant popularity. Following an international success, a patent application was submitted on March 28, 1995 for FlowRiders while the first international Flowboarding competition successfully took place with celebrity participants such as Kelly Slater, Terje Haakonsen, and Tony Hawk. Furthermore, in 1999, Lochtefeld secured a contract and investment from Swatch to create the first mobile FlowBarrel, built specifically for a promotional tour. The first event took place in Munich, Germany where Bill Bryan took home the prize as the champion. By 2000, 25 FlowRiders were available around the world, in countries such as Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Germany. In 2001, the first Wave House venue was established in Durban, South Africa and became the prototype for other venues in the future. 2006 marked the first time when a FlowRider was added on the deck of the Royal Caribbean cruise ship ‚ÄúFreedom of the Seas‚Äù. From then on, every Royal Caribbean‚Äôs ships are situated with FlowRiders on their sports deck. In 2015, there were in total more than 200 FlowRiders available in 35 countries.  Wave Design  The technology made by FlowRider, Inc. grants the ability to simulate different forms of ocean waves. This company is the only one that produced a device that is currently available in the market. At first, the devices were able to provide the simulation of breaking waves. A breaking wave is a wave whose amplitude reached a point where the wave energy is transformed into powerful kinetic energy. The breaking wave simulation attracts body boarders and surfers. Generally, the surfers move in a downward direction as the wave moves forward or they can move relative to the wave and execute certain movements. Flowriders get their speed from the energy of the water flowing at them, and can perform basic to sophisticated turns and tricks within a relatively small area. The curved surface of the FlowRider machine matches the actual curvature of a wave, and the curvature changes throughout the surface in order to provide a more realistic wave. The water is then pumped from the bottom up along the curved surface. These powerful pumps project approximately 7.5 cm (3 in) layer of water at speeds ranging from approximately 10 to 15 m/s (35 to 55 km/h; 20 to 35 mph). The biggest difference between the machine and an actual ocean wave, is that the flow rate of the water being pushed along the surface of the FlowRider is much larger than an actual wave. Finally, a vacuum helps keep the riders from skipping dangerously along the surface of the water. A flowrider performing a trick  FlowRider  FlowRider, Inc. continues to focus on creating different designs for this machine. The designs included are the FlowRider Compact, Single, Double, Triple, and Wave in a Box.  FlowRider Compact  The FlowRider Compact is the smallest version of the FlowRider. Created to be transported easily, it measures around 85 m2or 900 ft2. It weighs about 84,400 kg (186,000 lbs), and holds about 75,700 L (20,000 gal) of water in the tank, and needs 180 amps (90 kW/hr) to operate.  FlowRider Single  The FlowRider Single is the original smaller version of the more popular FlowRider Double. It is larger than the compact, but still provides easy transport. The Single measures 110.22 m2 (1188 ft2). It weighs 161,300 kg (362,000 lbs), and holds 106,000 L (28,100 gal) of water. In order to operate this machine, 360 amps (90 kW/hr) need to be used. All these versions provide specific padding that has been placed in order to increase durability along with the safety of the riders. The technology behind this design allows a 3-4 inch sheet of water. This version can be found in different resorts or parks in places like Texas, Virginia, and California.  FlowRider Double and Triple  The FlowRider Double continues to be the most popular design. This version can be found in places like Utah, California, Florida, and Singapore. This version measures 161 m2 (1,728 ft2). It weighs 238,7000 kg (530,500 lbs), and holds 160,000 L (42,200 gal) of water, and 180 kW/hr of electricity are needed to power this machine. The difference between the Single and the Double other than the size, is an inflatable barrier dividing the Double, which allows for two people to ride it at the same time. Similar to the other designs, the surface of the ride is tensioned in order to increase safety for the rider. The FlowRider Triple has a similar design to the Double. The Triple measures 195.2 m2 (2,226 ft2), weighs 232,700 kg (513,000 lbs), holds 212,500 L (56,000 gal) of water, and requires 570 amps (270 kW/hr) of electricity. Similar to the Double, it provides the option to be divided into three sections by 40 ft dividers or to be left as a larger version of the Single.  FlowRider Wave in a Box  The FlowRider Wave in a Box contains a similar size and design as the Single and Double. It measures 175 m2 (1,895 ft2), weighs 94,000 kg (2017,200 lbs), holds 60,570 L (16,000 gal) of water, and requires 360 amps (180 kW/hr) of electricity. The biggest difference with this design is that it is a self- contained unit, which means that the machine is completely self-sufficient and not dependent on the civil works. The design includes a tank along with its own pump system.  FlowBarrel  The FlowRider company created a different machine that allows riders to experience a different form of wave called the FlowBarrel. The design provides a way to recreate a tube riding. Tube riding is a term that surfers use in order to explain riding inside the curve of a breaking wave. The FlowBarrel contains two different types of designs. The FlowBarrel Ten measures 345 m2 (3,724ft2), holds 454,000 L (120,000 gal) of water, weighs 507,000 kg (1,100,000 lbs), and requires 1240 amps (640 kW/hr) of electricity to power. The FlowBarrel Ten Double is similar to the original FlowBarrel Ten, but the only difference is that instead of one barreling wave there are two, which provides the opportunity to have two people riding instead of one. The FlowBarrel Ten Double measures 621 m2 (6,688 ft2), holds 908,000 L (240,000 gal) of water, weighs 1,027,000 kg (2,264,700 lbs), and requires 2170 amps (1120 kW/hr) of electricity. Both designs allow the use of the bodyboard and the flowboard.  WaveOz and LatiTube  The WaveOz is a 180 degree surf machine. It is shaped like a large semicircle, which provides the opportunity for multiple people to remain on the ride at the same time. This continues to be the largest FlowRider creation along with the largest ride surface for any wave simulator. It measures 647 m2 (6,959 ft2), weighs 800,000 kg (1,760,000 lbs), holds 760,000 L (200,000 gal) of water, and requires 1,365 amps (630 kW/hr) of electricity. TheLatiTube is another unique design of the FlowRider machines. It holds around 6,135-127,585 L (17,207-33,704 gal) of water. This design is slightly different because it does not provide a sheet of water, but rather use nozzles controlled by remotes that provide the water for the riders. This design has four different versions: pocket single, pocket double, pocket switch, and custom double switch.  Board Design  Flowboard The flowboard is also known as the 'stand- up board' in flowriding. Boards differ in shape, materials, lengths and the angle at which the board curves. Generally they take a similar appearance to that of a wakeboard and can be further categorized into strapped and strapless boards. Boards with footstraps are generally used only on the FlowBarrel, but strapless boards are used on both the FlowRider and FlowBarrel. Flowboards range in length from , and in width from . They weigh between . Bodyboard Bodyboarders ride standard bodyboards in the prone, kneeling, or drop-knee position. Each position forms the basis for its own set of tricks. In most competitions, bodyboarders are required to do tricks in both prone and kneeling positions.  Wave House  The term Wave House refers to the entertainment venue concept invented by WaveLoch, Inc, which aims to bring the surfing lifestyle to each of its locations. There are currently six official Wave House locations around the world, but there are dozens of locations in which FlowRider and FlowBarrel waves are installed for public use. These venues are often similar to the Wave House concept and are located in their own buildings, at waterparks, and even at shopping malls. Many of these locations are hundreds of miles from the nearest ocean.  Flowriding League Of World (FLOW)  The Flowriding League of the World (FLOW) which was established in the early 2000s is the main competitive league for flowriders. FLOW breaks up the world tour into sub-tours in the United States, Europe, Asia and Canada. FLOW hosts multiple tour stops in each of these regions in order to give competitors the opportunity to build up enough points to qualify for the World Flowboarding Championships (WFC).  World Flowboarding Championships (WFC)  Each year FLOW hosts the WFC at a different Wave House around the world. The past few years have been in Punta Cana in South Korea(2019), the Dominican Republic (2018), Mexico (2017), and Singapore (2016). Within the WFC there are two events: one on the FlowRider wave and one on the FlowBarrel wave. Each Wave House around the world is responsible for finding two male Flowboarders, one female Flowboarder, and one Bodyboarder to represent their region of the world.

According to the 2017 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 2,809 inhabitants.  Name  At the beginning the village was called 'Malpartida' (Badly distributed in Spanish) because of the trouble to fit it into the lands of √Åvila, Oropesa or Talavera. In the 14th century, along with the expansion of its territories, the name Malpartida was finally changed for 'Mejorada' (Improved in Spanish) due to the improvements made on its territorial situation and to relieve the villagers who thought the previous name brought bad luck.  Location  Located 9 km north of Talavera de la Reina, the village is settled in the region of the 'Sierra de San Vicente', which is a subregion of Talavera. Mejorada adjoins Montesclarod to the North, Segurilla to the East, Talavera to the South and Velada to the West. It is located in the area enclosed between the Tagus river and the Ti√©tar river, a place called 'El Berrocal' The Guadyerbas River sets the northern frontier of the territory, and several streams, the largest being the Riolobos.  Main sights and monuments   The Castle  Mejorada holds the ruins of a castle placed around 250 meters (800 ft.) southeast of the village center. It is supposed to have been built on the 13th century, linked to the creation of the Estate of Mejorada, when king Sancho IV of Castile gave the village to the knight Juan Garc√≠a de Toledo in July 1288, who would become the first Lord of Mejorada. The fortress was built to enforce the lords of the village against the council of Talavera. The castle would then become the main symbol of the strength of nobility opposite the ecclesiastical power. The castle is built on a 78 feet side square with rounded turrets on each corner. The main entrance is placed looking west, in which wall there is a great mid medieval rectangular keep. The masonry and brick walls are approximately 5 feet thick. Nowadays the manor is in ruins, only lasting two walls and part of the other two.  Parish church of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n  The Church was made almost entirely of lime and stone which is very typical on the area, and dates back from the 15th century. It's devoted to Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n (Our Lady of the Assumption). It's a single nave with transept temple, with a two levels tower facing West, the chancel facing East and the main fa√ßade facing south. The ceiling is coffered with wooden beams in twos arranged slantwise creating the shape of the roof.  Watchover  The Watchtower is situated 2000 ft (600m) south from the city centre, on the summit of the Atalaya Hill at around 1900 ft (580m) high. The tower has a 5.5 ft (1.70m) circular floor-plan with a current height of 9.2 ft (2.80m) made of masonry and lime and sand mortar. This Watchtower was part of an ensemble of lookout watchtowers along with the ones on Velada, El Casar, Segurilla, Cardiel, etc. built probably during the Islamic times and then reused by the Christians until the Middle Ages.

Biography Howard Jordan Jr. became president of Savannah State College in September 1963 following the death of William K. Payne in August 1963. During his tenure as president the college established Savannah‚Äôs first graduate program in education (Master of Science in Elementary Education, 1968) and saw the program gain NCATE accreditation. Additionally, white students were admitted to the college as a result of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the first white faculty members were hired. Also during Jordan‚Äôs administration a major building program began which resulted in the construction of a modern student union, new football stadium, fine arts building, Payne Hall, and new dormitories for men and women. Dr. Jordan resigned from the College in 1971 to accept a position as vice chancellor for the central office of the Georgia Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia. He was the first African-American to hold this position. Ursula H. Shelton was the first African-American Administrative Assistant to work under Dr. Jordan during this new era in Atlanta. Legacy The Howard Jordan Business Building on the university‚Äôs campus is named in honor of Dr. Jordan. It houses 11 classrooms and the supporting staff and faculty offices.

The vocalizations are most commonly used by adult females around birthing season; the female will direct the call towards an unrelated mother and her offspring as an attempt to initiate friendly contact. However, mothers themselves will never direct girneys towards their own offspring as girneys do not increase affiliative interactions between relatives. Monkeys will also produce call when interacting with a dominant member of the same species, and when avoiding further conflict after becoming victim of an agonistic interaction. In all contexts, the vocalization is beneficial as it allows the signaler to inform potential aggressor that they are nonthreatening, thereby reducing the chance of attack and increasing fitness. Girneys are often accompanied by lip- smacking and a hesitant approach towards the dominant monkey. If the vocalization successfully reduces tension, it may be followed by allogrooming, alloparenting, and/or a rocking embrace.  Old World monkeys  Multiple species of Old World monkeys produce girneys. The actual sound of the vocalization varies slightly by species but its purpose is consistent ‚Äì to reduce tension between unrelated members of the same species. No accounts of monkeys directing girneys towards different species of monkeys have been observed. Monkeys who use the call include Japanese macaques, rhesus macaques, mandrills, and baboons. However, they have been most extensively studied in species of macaques. The calls are commonly observed in adult Old World monkeys, but rarely in juveniles. This is likely because juveniles are already groomed and protected by their mother and would not benefit from producing an affiliative call.  Morphology  Girneys resemble a moaning and purring sound with a song-like quality. The call stays within a low frequency range, but is very morphologically variable as it does not maintain a consistent temporal pattern. Instead, the vocalizations are uttered in rapid succession, through different patterns each time. The vocalization are produced in conjunction with lip movement and teeth chattering. Dario Maestripieri, professor of comparative human development at the University of Chicago, says the sounds are \\"made with their mouths almost closed, sort of nasal and relatively soft\\", and suggested that girneys are similar to human baby talk. In the context of mother offspring dyad approach, the morphology of girneys can be divided into two distinct vocalizations, atonal girneys and tonal girneys. Both atonal and tonal girneys are submissive and accompanied by a hesitant approach.  Atonal girneys  Vocalizations modified by a process of lip movement on teeth scraping is characteristic of atonal girneys. An adult female will produce this distinct call when approaching a cluster of females and infants late in the birth season, particularly when orientated toward the infant of the group.  Tonal girneys  Tonal girneys are more morphologically variable than atonal girneys as the characteristic tongue and lip movements are superimposed. The call is produced by an adult female who intends to participate in grooming with an unrelated dominant female. The subordinate directs the call while the dominant is separate from the cluster during birth season.  Function and context  Japanese macaques grooming  General function  Girneys are used in a variety of contexts but consistently function to ease affiliative social interactions between unrelated members of the same species and are generally directed from the subordinate monkey to the dominant monkey.  Establishing friendly contact with unrelated mother-offspring dyad  Male macaque do not often participate in infant care, so mothers tend to be highly protective of their infants and will display highly aggressive behavior and even physically attack monkeys who come within close proximity. In attempt to establish friendly contact with mother and minimize chance of attack, the subordinate adult female will produce girney. The call can also benefit the adult female in that it may increase probability of affiliative physical contact such as grooming, which reduces stress. Monkeys who do not produce the call upon approaching mother- offspring dyad are less likely to attain access to an affiliative interaction. Additionally, females without infants may be allowed access to handling an unrelated mothers infant after initiating friendly contact with girneys. In this case, they often continue to make the call during handling.  Acknowledging social hierarchy  Japanese macaques form despotic societies in which some members of group are ranked higher than others. The higher ranking macaques are considered dominant, and macaques of lower rank will produce girneys when in close proximity to dominant members, to signal appeasement and acknowledge inferiority. Low ranking females without infants are the least likely to receive girneys while high ranking females with infants are most likely to receive girneys within a troop. This is coherent with the proposition that girneys function to reduce tension, as low ranking females without infants are more likely to be victims of aggression than any other member of troop.  Post-conflict affiliation  Opponents of a conflict are attracted to each other for a short period of time following the conflict. During this time, the victim will produce girneys in attempt to restore friendly relations with former opponent. The victim is more likely to use the vocalization when opponent is less familiar, indicating that the production of girneys after conflict is dependent on how predictable the winner is to the victim. Despite the reconciliation intent of girneys, victims make themselves vulnerable to further aggression when initiating post conflict affiliation. So it is unclear if the vocalizations are effective in this context.

A pole barn under construction A pole barn under construction Pole framing or post-frame constructionAgriculture, U.S. Department of.. The Encyclopedia of Wood. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, Inc., 2011. 16-4 to 16-6. Print. (pole building framing, pole building, pole barn) is a simplified building technique adapted from the labor-intensive traditional timber framing technique. It uses large poles or posts buried in the ground or on a foundation to provide the vertical structural support, along with girts to provide horizontal support. The method was developed and matured during the 1930s as agricultural practices changed, including the shift toward engine-powered farm equipment and the demand for cheaper, larger barns and storage areas. History Pole building design was pioneered in the 1930s in the United States originally using utility poles for horse barns and agricultural buildings. The depressed value of agricultural products in the 1920s and 1930s and the emergence of large, corporate farming in the 1930s created a demand for larger, cheaper agricultural buildings.Vlach, John Michael. Barns. New York: W. W. Norton & Co. ;, 2003. 21‚Äì22. Print. As the practice took hold, rather than using utility poles, materials such as pole barn nails were developed specifically for this type of construction, making the process more affordable and reliable. Today, almost any low-rise structure can be quickly built using the post-frame construction method.National Frame Builders Association Pole barn construction was a quick and economical method of adding outbuildings on a farm as agriculture shifted to equipment-dependent and capital-intensive agriculture--necessitating shelter for tractors, harvesters, wagons and the like in much greater quantities and sizes. Around North America, many pole-built structures are still readily seen in rural and industrial areas. Construction Poles, from which these buildings get their name, are natural shaped or round wooden timbers in diameter.\\"Pole.\\" def. 3. Merriam-Webster.com. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 26 Jan. 2014. . The structural frame of a pole building is made of tree trunks, utility poles, engineered lumber or chemically pressure treated squared timbers which may be buried in the ground or anchored to a concrete slab. Generally the posts are evenly spaced apart except to allow for doors. Buried posts have the benefit of providing lateral stabilityStalnaker, Judith J., and Ernest C. Harris. Structural design in wood. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1989. 319. Print. so no braces are needed. Buried posts may be driven into the ground or set in holes then filled with soil, crushed stone, or concrete. Pole buildings do not require walls but may be open shelters, such as for farm animals or equipment or for use as picnic shelters. Enclosed pole buildings have exterior curtain walls formed by girts fastened to the exterior of the posts at intervals about on center that carry the siding and any interior load. The walls may be designed as a shear wall to provide structural stability. Other girt systems include framing in between the posts rather than on the outer side of the posts.Quality Steel Buildings, Inc. ‚Äì What is a pole building? Siding materials for a pole building are most commonly rolled-rib 29-gauge enameled steel cut to length in widths attached using color-matched screws with rubber washers to seal the holes. However, any standard siding can be used, including T1-11, vinyl, lap siding, cedar and even brick. Using sidings other than metal may require first installing sheathing, such plywood, oriented strand board or boards. On two walls, usually the long walls, the dimensional lumber girts at the top of the walls are doubled, one on the inside and one on the outside of the posts, and usually through-bolted with large carriage bolts to support the roof load. The roof structure is frequently a truss roof supporting purlins or laths, or built using common rafters. Wide buildings with common rafters need interior rows of posts. Sometimes rafters may be attached directly to the poles. The roof pitch of pole buildings is usually low and the roof form is usually gable or lean-to. Metal roofing is commonly used as the roofing and siding material on pole buildings. The floor may be soil, concrete slab, or framed of wood. Modern developments In modern developments the pole barns of the 1930s have become pole buildings for use as housing, commercial use, churches, picnic shelters or storage buildings. In the process more often than not, the poles have become posts of squared-off, pressure-treated timbers. These structures have the potential to replicate the functionality of other buildings, but they may be more affordable and require less time to construct. The most common use for pole buildings is storage buildings as it was on the farms, but today they may be for the storage of automobiles, boats, and RVs along with many other household items that would normally be found in a residential garage, or commercially as the surroundings for a light industry or small corporate offices with attached shops.Pole Building Glossary.

During the 1970s, he collaborated with the University System of Georgia and Armstrong State College in Savannah to develop an integration plan between the formerly all-white Armstrong State and (then) Georgia State, a historically black college (HBCU). The plan eliminated redundancy in the teaching and business degree programs in both colleges. Biography Early life and education He was born in Savannah, Georgia, on March 17, 1925, the son of Julia and Prince Albert Jackson. After graduating with honors from Beach-Cuyler High School, he joined the Naval Reserve.\\"Prince A. Jackson Biography\\", The HistoryMakers, 2007, accessed 10 Jun 2010 Jackson was a graduate of (then) Georgia State College, with a B.A. in mathematics. He earned his M.A. in mathematics at New York University and a Ph.D. in philosophy at Boston College. Early career Jackson was a professor of mathematics and philosophy and history. President In 1971, Jackson became the second Savannah State alumnus to become president of the college. (Cyrus G. Wiley, the third president, was the first). His administration established the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps at Savannah State, creating a pipeline for students to train as naval officers. He also established WHCJ-FM, the university‚Äôs radio station. He attracted more professors with doctorates, and managed institutionalization of the Title III program, re-accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and a major building campaign. As a result of a 1971 federal lawsuit, the University System of Georgia needed to integrate classes for then-Georgia State and Armstrong State colleges in Savannah. Traditionally having racially segregated student bodies, the colleges had duplicate programs in some areas. Jackson led Georgia State in collaborating on a solution, which resulted in his taking responsibility for business classes and awarding business degrees to students enrolled at either college. Classes and award of degrees for teaching were transferred to Armstrong State College in the process of implementation of the plan.Charles J. Elmore, \\"Savannah State University\\", New Georgia Encyclopedia, accessed 10 Jun 2010 After serving as president, Jackson returned to teach as a Professor of Mathematics at Savannah State for more than 20 years. He retired from the university in 1999, when another teacher of mathematics, Jacquelyn M. Byers, said, \\"Prince, let's go,\\" and they retired together. He published numerous articles and was active in professional and community organizations. A lifelong member of the NAACP, he served as president of the Savannah chapter in 2003. Marriage and family Jackson married the former Marilyn Striggles of Sylvania, Georgia. They have five adult children. Jackson also had a brother who married and five adult children as well who mostly reside in Atlanta, GA with their children Legacy and honors * Jackson received more than 50 academic honors and awards.

The plan is based on New Urbanist principles. History In July 1998 during a week-long charrette, Plan Baton Rouge was first conceived as an idea by a group of town planners, architects, developers, property owners, elected officials, civic organizations, community groups, downtown workers, and residents. Additional information The plan has guided the growth that has been catalyzed by the State of Louisiana‚Äôs ambitious downtown building program. Additionally, the Plan seeks to preserve and strengthen the two historic neighborhoods of Spanish Town and Beauregard Town. It sets forth a strategy to restore the pedestrian character and sense of place of downtown for all of its citizens to enjoy. The plan was developed by a well-renowned consultant team led by Duany Plater-Zyberk; the team focused on the physical design of downtown, the connections between the amenities, the transportation challenges and the retail dynamics. The plan‚Äôs flexibility seeks to serve Baton Rouge far into the future as witnessed with the evolution of the Shaw Center project and the opportunity seized by the private sector. Another initiative featured in the plan has already been realized with the creation of a public market, the Main Street Market, that has become a gathering place for the Baton Rouge community. The plan identified areas where public action could leverage sustained private investment over time. Since 1998, the state and other public agencies have poured $400 million into downtown and the private sector has responded with over $200 million. Plan Baton Rouge has been recognized nationally for its success in focusing citizens and public agencies on a common goal. Downtown Baton Rouge's future As the 104 proposals in the plan are implemented, Downtown Baton Rouge will resume its traditional role as the vital center of the Parish and the active Capitol of Louisiana. Plan Baton Rouge will transform downtown into a 24-hour destination where residents and tourists will visit and recreate. More importantly, downtown will become a gathering place for the community. Plan Baton Rouge was always envisioned as a model to be applied in other areas of the city using focused strategy to guide the growth and development of the area. Plan Baton Rouge has joined its efforts with the Mayor‚Äôs Smart Growth Task Force to bring principles of good planning and Smart Growth to other areas of the city. Plan Baton Rouge now has the opportunity to focus its efforts on another study area, Old South Baton Rouge. This is a natural extension of the Baton Rouge Area Foundation‚Äôs participation in on the Hope VI grant.

Early life and education Julia Taft was born on March 4, 1845, in Lyons, New York, to Horatio Nelson Taft, an attorney and examiner in the U.S. Patent Office, and his wife. The family lived in Washington D.C. when Julia was a child and young woman. As the young sons of President Abraham Lincoln had no playmates at the White House, the First Lady Mary Lincoln asked Mrs. Taft if she had children who might come to see them. Mrs. Taft asked her daughter Julia to take 14-year-old Horatio Nelson Jr., or Bud, and 11-year-old Halsey Cook Taft, called Holly, with her to the White House to play with the Lincoln boys. During this time, Julia Taft was befriended by Mary and President Lincoln. After Willie Lincoln died of typhoid fever on February 20, 1862, the Taft children stopped visiting the White House. Julia Bayne's half brother Charles Sabin Taft was a physician; he was one of the first doctors on the scene when President Lincoln was shot on April 14, 1865 at Ford's Theatre. He remained with the President until his death. Marriage and family She had a daughter and four sons, all of whom survived her. Publication In 1931, just two years before her death, Julia Bayne published her memoir, Tad Lincoln's Father, based on her visits to the White House of the Lincolns. Bayne's memoir provides a unique glimpse into the social and family life of the Lincoln White House. In the work, she wrote of her initial fear of the towering, rough-and-tumble Lincoln, who won her over with teasing. She also discussed an emerging relationship with Mary, who had no daughters and so took particular comfort in Julia's presence. She died at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Frank H. West, in Champaign, Illinois. In 2001, Tad Lincoln's Father was reprinted by Bison Books, University of Nebraska Press ().

He is most famous as the father of modern bow hunting, and for his close relationship with Ishi, the last member of the Yahi tribe and the last known American Indian to be raised largely isolated from Western culture. Early life Born in Fort Stockton, Texas as the son of an army surgeon, Pope grew up in military camps and frontier towns, where he learned outdoor skills and became an athlete. This is where he first learned archery, as well as horsemanship, riflery, knifemaking, and other skills. He built and attempted to fly a glider. He later went to medical school at the University of California, graduating in 1899. He set up a practice in Watsonville, California near San Francisco, married Emma Wightman, a medical school classmate, and had four children. In 1912, he became a surgical instructor at the medical school. Relationship with Ishi The medical school where Pope taught was located near the museum where Ishi worked as a janitor, having been brought there for study by Professor T. T. Waterman of the University of California Department of Anthropology. Because Ishi had grown up in the isolated Yahi tribe, he had little immunity to diseases, and Pope met Ishi during his stays at the University hospital. Pope learned some of the Yahi language, and spent much time with Ishi, learning of his life and listening to the Yahi tribal folklore. Ishi taught Pope how to make bows and arrows as the Yahi did, and how to hunt with them. Pope and Ishi remained close until Ishi's death from tuberculosis in 1916. In spite of this close relationship and against the frequently stated wishes of his Yahi friend, Pope insisted that Ishi be autopsied after death and his brain removed. Later life Pope became an avid bowhunter during his time with Ishi, and he continued that after Ishi's death. In 1920, with special permission, Pope and a companion, Arthur Young, went hunting grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park with hand made bows and steel tipped arrows, taking several. The stuffed and mounted bears are on display at the California Academy of Sciences. Pope later wrote a book, Hunting with the Bow and Arrow, which remains in print. He continued bowhunting until his death in 1926 from pneumonia. Legacy Saxton Pope and Arthur Young have been honored as the namesakes of the Pope and Young Club, an organization dedicated to bowhunting which continues today and includes its own world record book for North American game. In order to be entered into the Pope and Young records, the game animal must be taken with a bow and arrow. He also reintroduced traditional bow and arrow making skills learned from Ishi to other Native Americans whose communities had lost the art.

It is believed that he arrived in Rome as a child and received some of his earliest training from Tarquinio Ligustri. One source attributes his training to Guercino (Gian Francesco Barbieri called Guercino da Cento) however that was likely in error as Cavarozzi was four years older than Guercino.Coretini, Gaetano (1774).

Paolo Giunchi, Stamperia di San Michele a Ripa Grande, Rome. 160 pp. (page 130) The earliest of his known works, Santa Ursula and his companions with Pope Cir√≠aco and Santa Catalina de Alejandr√≠a (1608) was painted for the church of the Confraternity of Sante Orsola e Caterina (now in Basilica of St. Mark the Evangelist, Rome) and shows the influence of Cristofano Roncalli (one of three painters sometimes referred to as Il Pomarancio).Museo del Prado, Enciclopedia - Voz: Cavarozzi, Bartolomeo. Accessed 4 December 2019 Saint Jerome with Two Angels (1617) oil on canvas (116 x 173 cm) Palatine Gallery. Palazzo Pitti, Florence At some point before 1617, Bartolomeo Cavarozzi was taken in and living in the palace of a Roman nobleman Giovanni Battista Crescenzi. Crescenzi was a painter and architect who had established an academy in Rome for young painters in the vicinity of the Pantheon, where he taught drawing and art. Much of the training there was focused on drawing directly from life curious and beautiful objects provided by Crescenzi such as fruits, vegetables, animals, and such found around Rome. An example of Cavarozzi's still-life painting is Grape Vines and Fruit, with Three Wagtailsca (ca. 1615‚Äì18) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. His still-life paintings have been said to be \\"important for the history of still-life painting in both Italy and Spain\\". Among Cavarozzi's finest work is a painting of Saint Jerome with Two Angels, which was purchased in 1617 by the Medici in Florence. The training Cavarozzi received at Crescenzi's academy can be seen in the still life with skull, rosary, books, and crucifix on the worm-eaten table. Also evident is Caravaggio's style in the remarkable handling of light in the Saint Jerome painting. One author suggested Cavarozzi was the painter known as the Master of the Acquavella Still Life, one of the finest still-life painters of early seventeenth-century Rome, but, this attribution is not universally accepted.Papi, Gianni (2015).

In 1617 Giovanni Battista Crescenzi traveled to Spain to work in the Pantheon of the Escorial and in this period he was significant in defining artistic taste in the Madrid court. Crescenzi brought Cavarozzi with him to Spain where they worked for approximately two years. The paintings Cavarozzi produced in Spain show Caravaggio's use of naturalistic figures in raking light and darkness however, he developed a distinguishing style of his own, which among other things was less inclined toward drama and leaning more to tender and reserved figures. The Holy Family with Saint Catherine of Alexandria (1618) in the Prado Museum, Madrid dates from Cavarozzi's time in Spain. Some have observed the influence of Cavarozzi in the early works of the Spanish painter Jusepe de Ribera, who conversely would have seen Cavarozzi's work in Italy, just before or about the time Cavarozzi left for Spain. Included among these are some of Ribera's paintings of Saints and particularly in The Calvary (Crucifixion) [see external links below] in the Patronato de Arte Osuna, Seville: \\"A striking similarity can be found in the figure of Mary Magdalen - especially in the treatment of her luxurious green and yellow clothing - to the style of the Roman artist Bartolomeo Cavarozzi (ca. 1590-1625) in the years immediately prior to his trip to Spain (1617-18)\\".P√©rez S√°nchez, Alfonso E., and Nicola Spinosa (1992). Jusepe de Ribera 1591-1652. The Mertopolitan Museum of Art, New York, distributed by Harry N. Abrams, Inc., New York. 290 pp. (see 21 p., 69 p., 74 p.) . Cavarozzi returned to Rome in 1619. He was active in Rome and in his home town of Viterbo where he produced a painting of Saint Isidore for the Chiesa Collegiata di Sant'Angelo in Spata, and in 1622 his painting of the Visitation was installed in Viterbo which now hangs in the Town Hall chapel. He is known to have coped his own work, and in the case of one painting of the Holy Family \\"almost ad nauseam\\". He died in Rome on 21 September 1625 at the relatively young age of thirty-eight. Other works include a San Silvestro for the Church of the Confraternity of Jesus; a St Phillip Apostle for the Church of San Pietro del Castagno; a St Benedict for the lateral door of the Church of Monasterio della Duchessa; a Presentation at the Temple for the Church of the College of Doctors, and also painted a canvas for the Chapel of the Calabresi family in the church of Sant'Ignazio. A contemporary from Viterbo, Filippo Caparozzi, was a disciple of Giuseppe d'Arpino.

Prince described the Reynell family as being 'descended from a very antient stock, transplanted hither from the county of Cambridge... above three hundred years since; where it still flourishes in worshipful degree'. The Heralds Visitations of 1620 traced earlier generations of the family and described the first of this distinguished line as 'Richard Reinell who had the custody of the Castles of Exeter (built by Baldwin de Redvers) and Launceston... 1191, Sheriff of Devon 1191-94' Between the reigns of King John and Henry V, the Reynells 'were ever men of great credit, fidelity, and service, to their Kings, country and state as well in peace matters as wars' They had great 'revenues, offices, lordships and lands, in sundry shires' including Somerset, Cambridgeshire and Yorkshire, but their greatest possessions were in Devon and Cornwall.

One Reynell was secretary to Henry VI and travelled with him to conclude a peace with France. The most consistent association of the family was with the law, 'sitting with the judges of the kingdom, in taking assizes, and determining grievous enormities', and it is to this tradition that Richard Reynell (d.1585) belonged, being a commissioner of the peace for nearly forty years.

Convento de las Bernardas, Alcal√° de Henares Angelo Nardi da Razzo (19 February 1584, Vaglia ‚Äì 1664, Madrid) was an Italian painter of the early Baroque period; active primarily in Spain.  Biography  He was born to a noble Florentine family that had been dispossessed of their assets and banished by the Medicis. His artistic formation probably took place in a circle of painters that included major figures of the Counter-reformation such as Ludovico Cigoli, Domenico Passignano and Gregorio Pagani. From approximately 1600 to 1607, he lived in Venice. After that time, he established himself in Madrid. By 1615, he had been commissioned to paint a series of works celebrating a meeting of Spanish and French royalty in Irun. Those paintings were destroyed in a fire at the Royal Alc√°zar of Madrid in 1734. Between 1619 and 1620, he executed a series of works for the in Alcal√° de Henares, occasioned by the recent death of its founder, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas. These are considered to be the first works of his artistic maturity. At the same time, records show that he was employed as the manager of workshop belonging to . Following Aguilera's death in 1620, he took over the studio and, in 1623, married his thirteen-year-old daughter. This is believed to have been a \\"marriage of convenience\\" and he had it annulled in 1625. Marcos' son, Lorenzo, filed suit against Nardi, but it was dismissed. Shortly after, he received the largely honorary (unpaid) position of Painter to the King. The death of Bartolom√© Gonz√°lez in 1627 left an opening for court painter, which Nardi finally obtained in 1631, despite some very serious competition. Among his competitors was Diego Vel√°zquez, who was awarded a similar post. Over the years, they developed a friendly working relationship. Nardi would act as a character witness in favor of Vel√°zquez when he was being considered for the Order of Santiago. With his economic situation secured, he devoted some time to doing works for religious communities. Later, he would win his fellow painters an exemption from the alcabala; a type of sales tax. He was interred at the Church of the Misericordia, which was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. A street in Vaglia bears his name. Selected works  Presentation of Jesus in the Temple.

It is located 2 km away from Kollumangudi, 40 km away from Kumbakonam and 10 km from Karaikal. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Sthalasayana Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Thirumagal Nachiyar. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all the shrines. There is a four-tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, in the temple. Sthalasayana Perumal is believed to have appeared to sage Vyaghrapada. Three daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmotsavam festival, celebrated during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May‚ÄìJune), being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.  Legend  thumb Shiva ordered the sage Vyaghrapada to perform penance at Srirangam requesting the god Vishnu to give him place in his abode Vaikunta. Vyaghrapada was joined by sage Patanjali in his journey. Because of his poor eyesight, the sages instead went southward, lost their way and reached Krupa Samudram, modern day Tirusirupuliyur. They prayed to Vishnu to come from Srirangam to grant them moksha(divine attainment). Vishnu is believed to have appeared for sage Vyasa also at this place. It is believed that Vishnu originally gave darshan (appeared) to the sages as Ranganatha, the form worshipped in the Srirangam temple. Because of their old age, the sages could not see the big image of Vishnu clearly and hence he appeared in a smaller form known as Bala Sayanam (smaller recline), the sleeping posture of a small kid. Being in smaller form, and the saint who worshipped was in the form of a tiger, this place is called Siru (meaning small) Puli (meaning tiger) yur (meaning dwelling place).Ayyar 1991, p. 342  Temple Tiruchirupuliur thumb A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all the shrines. There is a four-tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, in the temple. The presiding deity is Sthalasayana Perumal and is a small image depicted in Sayana posture. The idol of Vyaghrapada is found along with that of Kanvar in the sanctum sanctorum. All episodes connected with this place are found in the fourth chapter of the Brahmanda Purana. Saint Tirumangai Alvar visited the temple, but was not satisfied with Vishnu's small image of \\"Balasayanam\\", he requested him to show his gigantic pose. Vishnu asked the saint to go to Thirukkannamangai to witness his Vishvarupa. The presiding deity at Chirupuliyur is also named by the saint in his Periya Thirumozhi verse.R. 2001, p. 497-8 The name of the presiding deity in Sanskrit is Kripasamudra Perumal. He is also known as \\"Saranagatha Rakshaka Perumal\\", by which name the saints have addressed the god Aamaruviyappan in Therazhundur. A separate shrine for Adhiseshan is present near to the pushkarani - known as Ananthalwar Temple.  Religious importance  Inner thumb A special feature of this temple is that this is one of the only two Divya Desams where the image of Vishnu is depicted in Sayana Kolam (sleeping posture) facing the Southern direction, the other being Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple. It is believed that Garuda, the eagle vehicle of Vishnu, does not fly over this place. Once Garuda and Adiseshan (the snake on whom Vishnu rests in his abode Vaikunta) got into an argument as to who was more powerful and devoted to their lord. Finding Garuda a little arrogant, Vishnu went in favour of Adisesha. Worried that Garuda might be angered at this, Adisesha sought the protection of Vishnu, upon which Vishnu asked him to roll himself and hide under him. It is said that as a result of this anger, Garuda never flies over this place. There is another legend that Adiseshan won the argument and since snakes were sworn enemies of eagles, Adiseshan hid himself under the waters of the temple tank. It is henceforth believed that devotees will be relieved of Naaga Dosham (affliction due to serpent god) if one visits this temple. Unmarried people and childless couple can also visit this temple for salvation. The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai alvar. The Azhwar has sung praise on the different forms of Sthalasayana Perumal. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Festivals and religious practices thumb The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows vaikanasa aagama. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed three times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:30 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Sthalasayana Perumal and Thirumagal Nachiyar. During the last step of worship, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.

The house and its grounds were bought by Wiltshire County Council in 1925 for use as a school, and today the house forms part of Devizes School, the town's secondary school. History Southbroom is first mentioned in 1227 and was probably then part of a broom- clad area, which seems still traceable in 1360, when a cottage stood called \\"super Southbroom\\". The first known owner of Southbroom House was John Drew (or Trew), a wealthy clothier from Devon. When John Drew occupied the Estate in 1501 it consisted of the house, a dovehouse, a small park, orchards, and gardens. A small pond was thought to have existed on the estate at that time although this was not shown in later records. This could have some connection with Drews Pond, which is on the outskirts of Devizes.Drews Pond at devizesheritage.org.uk The estate passed to John Drew‚Äôs grandson who was also called John. When he died in 1614, the estate passed to his son, Robert. For unknown reasons Sir Charles Lloyd burnt down the house in 1645. Robert died in the fire leaving the dovehouse, etc., to his widow Elizabeth. Their son, John Drew, died soon after inheriting the estate, leaving the remaining property to his widow who, in 1664, married Sir Henry Andrews, 1st Baronet, of Lathbury. The bulk of the estate stayed in the Drew family until 1680 when it was bought by John Eyles, a London merchant, who was Lord Mayor of London for part of 1688. In 1773, a new house was built on the original site by Edward Eyles, with imported Bath labour. A fire occurred in the new building in 1779 but did not destroy the whole house. The property descended to Edward‚Äôs daughter Maria who married George Heathcote of London. Maria was born on 12 June 1706; she married in 1724 and died in 1792. She is buried in St John‚Äôs Church cemetery in Devizes. George Heathcote became Lord Mayor of London in 1742. Devizes School, which now occupies Southbroom House, is organised into four houses, one of which is called Heathcote House, another 18th-century house nearby.Heathcote House at devizesheritage.org.uk George and Maria‚Äôs son Josiah Eyles Heathcote died in 1811 and the estate was sold in 1812 to William Salmon. The park (then 22 acres) was by this time encircled by trees and rare plants and adorned by ‚Äòromantic' walls. The whole estate while in the possession of William Salmon amounted to . William was succeeded by W. W. Salmon, who left the town in 1828. Then or later the whole estate was sold to George Watson-Taylor of Erlestoke. Some accounts say that his son Simon Watson-Taylor was the occupier in 1880 but other accounts say that it was owned by Robert Parry Nisbet (1793‚Äì1882) who owned the estate in 1841, and is referenced to live there on the occasion of his marriage in 1847.The Gentleman's Magazine, XXVIII, 1847 His crest is on one of the two lodges, the other of which was demolished in 1968. In 1913 and 1914, R. H. Caird owned the property. He left the town and sold the estate, which then consisted of the house, a private golf course, a park with a small maze, and rare trees and plants to Sir Horace Westropp McMahon. The next owners of the house were Wiltshire County Council, who bought it in 1926. They were succeeded by Wiltshire Council in 2009. The house In the days when the Eyles family owned the house the attics had one main use, to provide a place to sleep for the servants. Each night the butler would bring a ladder to the attic entrance so that the servants could go up to their room to sleep. He would then remove it until the following morning when again he would bring the ladder and allow the servants to get down. The house consisted of a dining hall, library, study, drawing room, servants quarters, morning room, bedrooms, bathroom and conservatory. Also there were extensive gardens and shrubberies. The house was considerably altered and extended in the 19th and 20th centuries for use as part of a school. The original building dating mainly from 1773 is of Bath stone ashlar and consists of a two-story central block flanked by much lower service wings. The wings have been considerably altered but retain a few original round-headed openings on the ground floor with some oval windows above. The house was recorded as Grade II* listed in 1954. Schools Wiltshire County Council purchased Southbroom House in 1925, together with of grounds. The house was adapted as a senior school for children over the age of eight in the southern part of the town. The adjacent Heathcote House, formerly the private Devizes Grammar School from 1874 to 1919,Devizes Grammar School at devizesheritage.org.uk was used as the Headmaster's residence of the new school, and in 1929 a large classroom at the rear was adapted as a Domestic Science Room. By 1930, there was a 'housecraft centre' near the school and a large garden for the pupils to work in. In 1936, a new block was added to the Heathcote House section to form a Handicraft Centre and Science Laboratory. The school continued to expand and in 1937 a kitchen and canteen were opened to provide hot dinners for the children. Early in the Second World War, the school's buildings were converted into a reception and dispersal centre for evacuees. The Devizes Day Nursery was built in the grounds as an emergency measure; this became redundant in 1947 and provided extra accommodation for the school. In 1949, the school became a secondary modern with the name of Southbroom Secondary School. In 1950, there were 452 pupils and numbers rose to 590 aged between 8 and 15 by 1954. The school was considered too small and was enlarged in 1956, and again in 1964. In 1969 Southbroom Secondary School was merged with Devizes Grammar School to form Devizes Comprehensive School, which later became Devizes School. As of 1980, Southbroom House was used mainly for school staff offices and the staff common room.

It functioned from 1407 to 1575. It was the largest convent in Livonia, and one of the largest in Northern Europe. History The idea of founding the monastery dates to merchants (H. Huxer, G. Kruse, H. Swalbart) of Tallinn of around 1400. In 1407, two monks from Vadstena Abbey arrived in Tallinn to counsel the merchants. The first permit to break dolomite to gather building material for building the complex was acquired in 1417. The convent was constructed under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Swalbart. The main church of the monastery was consecrated on 15 August 1436 by the Bishop of Tallinn Heinrich II. Several of the merchants who had originally proposed the monastery later became its monks. During its heyday, Pirita Convent became the largest Catholic monastery in Livonia. The decline of the convent started after the adoption of the Protestant Reformation in Estonia in 1525, although it was allowed to continue to function. During the Livonian War in 1577, Pirita Convent was attacked by Russian troops under the leadership of Ivan the Terrible. They sacked the monastery, looted its riches and burned it down. Pirita Convent was abandoned since then, but local people used adjacent lands as a cemetery.

This high-magnification image shows part of a cell with single bacteroids within their host plant. In this image, endoplasmic reticulum, dictysome, and cell wall can be seen. Rhizobacteria are root- associated bacteria that form symbiotic relationships with many plants. The name comes from the Greek rhiza, meaning root. Though parasitic varieties of rhizobacteria exist, the term usually refers to bacteria that form a relationship beneficial for both parties (mutualism). They are an important group of microorganisms used in biofertilizer. Biofertilization accounts for about 65% of the nitrogen supply to crops worldwide. Rhizobacteria are often referred to as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, or PGPRs. The term PGPRs was first used by Joseph W. Kloepper in the late 1970s and has become commonly used in scientific literature. PGPRs have different relationships with different species of host plants. The two major classes of relationships are rhizospheric and endophytic. Rhizospheric relationships consist of the PGPRs that colonize the surface of the root, or superficial intercellular spaces of the host plant, often forming root nodules. The dominant species found in the rhizosphere is a microbe from the genus Azospirillum. Endophytic relationships involve the PGPRs residing and growing within the host plant in the apoplastic space. Nitrogen fixation Nitrogen fixation is one of the most beneficial processes performed by rhizobacteria. Nitrogen is a vital nutrient to plants and gaseous nitrogen (N2) is not available to them due to the high energy required to break the triple bonds between the two atoms. Rhizobacteria, through nitrogen fixation, are able to convert gaseous nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) making it an available nutrient to the host plant which can support and enhance plant growth. The host plant provides the bacteria with amino acids so they do not need to assimilate ammonia. The amino acids are then shuttled back to the plant with newly fixed nitrogen. Nitrogenase is an enzyme involved in nitrogen fixation and requires anaerobic conditions. Membranes within root nodules are able to provide these conditions. The rhizobacteria require oxygen to metabolize, so oxygen is provided by a hemoglobin protein called leghemoglobin which is produced within the nodules. Legumes are well-known nitrogen-fixing crops and have been used for centuries in crop rotation to maintain the health of the soil. Symbiotic relationships The symbiotic relationship between rhizobacteria and their host plants is not without costs. For the plant to be able to benefit from the added available nutrients provided by the rhizobacteria, it needs to provide a place and the proper conditions for the rhizobacteria to live. Creating and maintaining root nodules for rhizobacteria can cost between 12‚Äì25% of the plant's total photosynthetic output. Legumes are often able to colonize early successional environments due to the unavailability of nutrients. Once colonized, though, the rhizobacteria make the soil surrounding the plant more nutrient rich, which in turn can lead to competition with other plants. The symbiotic relationship, in short, can lead to increased competition. PGPRs increase the availability of nutrients through the solubilization of unavailable forms of nutrients and by the production of siderophores which aids in the facilitating of nutrient transport. Phosphorus, a limiting nutrient for plant growth, can be plentiful in soil, but is most commonly found in insoluble forms. Organic acids and phosphotases released by rhizobacteria found in plant rhizospheres facilitate the conversion of insoluble forms of phosphorus to plant-available forms such as H2PO4‚àí. PGPR bacteria include Pseudomonas putida, Azospirillum fluorescens, and Azospirillum lipoferum and notable nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with legumes includes Allorhizobium, Azorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Rhizobium. Though microbial inoculants can be beneficial for crops, they are not widely used in industrial agriculture, as large-scale application techniques have yet to become economically viable. A notable exception is the use of rhizobial inoculants for legumes such as peas. Inoculation with PGPRs ensures efficient nitrogen fixation, and they have been employed in North American agriculture for over 100 years. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Plant growth- promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were first defined by Kloepper and Schroth to describe soil bacteria that colonize the roots of plants following inoculation onto seed and that enhance plant growth. The following are implicit in the colonization process: ability to survive inoculation onto seed, to multiply in the spermosphere (region surrounding the seed) in response to seed exudates, to attach to the root surface, and to colonize the developing root system. The ineffectiveness of PGPR in the field has often been attributed to their inability to colonize plant roots. A variety of bacterial traits and specific genes contribute to this process, but only a few have been identified. These include motility, chemotaxis to seed and root exudates, production of pili or fimbriae, production of specific cell surface components, ability to use specific components of root exudates, protein secretion, and quorum sensing. The generation of mutants altered in expression of these traits is aiding our understanding of the precise role each one plays in the colonization process. Progress in the identification of new, previously uncharacterized genes is being made using nonbiased screening strategies that rely on gene fusion technologies. These strategies employ reporter transposons and in vitro expression technology (IVET) to detect genes expressed during colonization. Using molecular markers such as green fluorescent protein or fluorescent antibodies, it is possible to monitor the location of individual rhizobacteria on the root using confocal laser scanning microscopy. This approach has also been combined with an rRNA-targeting probe to monitor the metabolic activity of a rhizobacterial strain in the rhizosphere and showed that bacteria located at the root tip were most active.  Mechanisms of action PGPRs enhance plant growth by direct and indirect means, but the specific mechanisms involved have not all been well characterized. Direct mechanisms of plant growth promotion by PGPRs can be demonstrated in the absence of plant pathogens or other rhizosphere microorganisms, while indirect mechanisms involve the ability of PGPRs to reduce the harmful effects of plant pathogens on crop yield. PGPRs have been reported to directly enhance plant growth by a variety of mechanisms: fixation of atmospheric nitrogen transferred to the plant, production of siderophores that chelate iron and make it available to the plant root, solubilization of minerals such as phosphorus, and synthesis of phytohormones. Direct enhancement of mineral uptake due to increases in specific ion fluxes at the root surface in the presence of PGPRs has also been reported. PGPR strains may use one or more of these mechanisms in the rhizosphere. Molecular approaches using microbial and plant mutants altered in their ability to synthesize or respond to specific phytohormones have increased understanding of the role of phytohormone synthesis as a direct mechanism of plant growth enhancement by PGPRs. PGPR that synthesize auxins and cytokinins or that interfere with plant ethylene synthesis have been identified. Pathogenic roles Studies conducted on sugar beet crops found that some root-colonizing bacteria were deleterious rhizobacteria (DRB). Sugar beet seeds inoculated with DRB had reduced germination rates, root lesions, reduced root elongation, root distortions, increased fungi infection, and decreased plant growth. In one trial the sugar beet yield was reduced by 48%. Six strains of rhizobacteria have been identified as being DRB. The strains are in the genera Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Flavobacterium, Achromobacter, and Arthrobacter. Due to a large number of taxonomic species yet to be described, complete characterization has not been possible as DRB are highly variable. The presence of PGPRs has proven to reduce and inhibit the colonization of DRB on sugar beet roots. Plots inoculated with PGPRs and DRBs had an increase in production of 39% while plots only treated with DRBs had a reduction in production of 30%. Biocontrol Rhizobacteria are also able to control plant diseases that are caused by other bacteria and fungi. Disease is suppressed through induced systematic resistance and through the production of antifungal metabolites. Pseudomonas biocontrol strains have been genetically modified to improve plant growth and improve the disease resistance of agricultural crops. In agriculture, inoculant bacteria are often applied to the seed coat of seeds prior to being sown. Inoculated seeds are more likely to establish large enough rhizobacterial populations within the rhizosphere to produce notable beneficial effects on the crop.

The term is gaining in importance due to the increased controversy over \\"rights of cultural practice\\", which are protected in many jurisdictions for indigenous peoples and sometimes ethnic minorities. It is also a major component of the field of cultural studies, and is a primary focus of international works such as the United Nations declaration of the rights of indigenous Peoples. Cultural practice is also a subject of discussion in questions of cultural survival. If an ethnic group retains its formal ethnic identity but loses its core cultural practices or the knowledge, resources, or ability to continue them, questions arise as to whether the culture is able to actually survive at all. International bodies such as the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues continually work on these issues, which are increasingly at the forefront of globalization questions. Examples * Religious and spiritual practices * Medical treatment practices * Forms of artistic expression * Dietary preferences and culinary practices * Cultural institutions (see also Cultural Institutions Studies) * Natural resource management * Housing and construction * Childcare practices * Governance, leadership, conflict resolution * Power relationships * International cultural practices * \\"Everyday life\\" practices (including household relationships) Qualifications The real question of what qualifies as a legitimate cultural practice is the subject of much legal and ethnic community debate. The question arises in controversial subject areas such as genital mutilation, indigenous hunting and gathering practices, and the question of licensing of traditional medical practitioners. Many traditional cultures acknowledge members outside of their ethnicity as cultural practitioners, but only under special circumstances. Generally, the knowledge or title must be passed in a traditional way, such as family knowledge shared through adoption, or through a master of that practice choosing a particular student who shows qualities desired for that practice, and teaching that student in a hands-on manner, in which they are able to absorb the core values and belief systems of the culture. The degree to which these non-ethnic practitioners are able to exercise \\"customary and traditional\\" rights, and the degree to which their practice is acknowledged as valid, is often a subject of considerable debate among indigenous and other ethnic communities, and sometimes with the legal systems under which these communities function. The difference between bona fide non-native cultural practitioners and cultural piracy, or cultural appropriation, is a major issue within the study of globalization and modernization. Evolution of culture The evolution of traditional cultures is a subject of much discussion in legal, scholarly, and community forums. It is generally accepted that all cultures are to some degree in a continual state of sociocultural evolution. However, major questions surround the legitimacy of newly evolved cultural expressions, especially when these are influenced by modernization or by the influence of other cultures. Also, there is significant debate surrounding the source of evolution: for example, an indigenous community may accept the use of store-bought materials in the creation of traditional arts, but may reject requirements to apply for a permit for certain gathering purposes; the central difference being that one is an internal cultural evolution, while the other is externally driven by the society or legal body that surrounds the culture.

The Black River is a tributary of the Duwamish River in King County in the U.S. state of Washington. It drained Lake Washington until 1916, when the opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal lowered the lake, causing part of the Black River to dry up. It still exists as a dammed stream about long. Before the 20th century, Lake Washington emptied from its south end into the Black River, which was joined by the Cedar River before meeting the White River (now the lower Green River; the White River has been diverted south). The confluence of the Black and White rivers created the Duwamish River, which emptied into Elliott Bay in Puget Sound. Thus, the water of rivers emptying into Lake Washington, such as the Sammamish River, once flowed through the Black and Duwamish rivers. Today, Lake Washington's water empties into Puget Sound via the Lake Washington Ship Canal.\\"The Green-Duwamish: A River System Re- Plumbed\\", The Green-Duwamish River: Connecting people with a diverse environment. Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition/TAG. No date, appears to be 2008 or 2009. In November 1911, the Cedar River flooded Renton. In 1912, the Cedar was diverted from the Black River into Lake Washington to avoid future floods. Its water still flowed through the Black after passing through Lake Washington. In 1916, with the opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal in Seattle, the lake's level dropped nearly nine feet and the Black River dried up. Today, part of its bed forms the Black River Riparian Forest and Wetland. The Duwamish people lived along the Black River for many centuries. Duwamish settlements remained along the river until it dried up in 1916.Herons Forever, History of the Black River Several indigenous villages were located near the confluence of the Black and Duwamish rivers. The area was called \\"Inside Place\\" (Lushootseed: Dxwd…ôw, from which comes the word \\"Duwamish\\"), referring to its location inland from Puget Sound. Long used as a place of refuge, the area became home to many natives displaced by the growing city of Seattle, until the Black River dried up.

It was built in 1920 by Joseph A. Britton and Son. Prior to the reconstruction of the Bridgeton Bridge in 2006, the Nevins Bridge was the newest covered bridge in Parke County. Note: This includes and Site map. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History The bridge was built at Gilkerson's Ford. Thomes Gilkerson had moved to the area in 1821 from Mercer County, Kentucky. In 1823 he built a mill near the ford that would later bear his name. The Gilkersons worked as blacksmiths, carpenters, farmers and millers and a small community soon sprang up around their business. In 1824 the Gilkerson's community, near the ford, was nominated for the county seat of Parke County but lost out to Rockville. From 1839-1846 they built several flatboats that would be sent down the Little Raccoon to the Big Raccoon and eventually to the Wabash during the spring freshets. Thomas Levi Nevins, born in 1869, later bought the Gilkerson property in 1897. This is who the Nevins Bridge is named for. He studied the mill and preserved the relics from the mill. By 1906 he was part owner of the Bloomingdale Mill and in 1910 he rebuilt the flour mill in Rosedale on the foundations of the older mill that had burned down. However, in 1911, after only 18 months of operation, this mill burned down too. He is also remembered as a school teacher in the nearby village of Minshall. Elmer Gerard had won the bid in 1915 to build the Bowsher Ford Covered Bridge but he actually had J.A. Britton's son Eugene Britton build the bridge. Joseph A. Britton and Elmer Gerard had both submitted bids for this bridge. Britton won the contract for the Nevins bridge, but again, Eugene was probably the major contributor much like he might have been if Elmer Gerard had won the bid. The building of the Nevins Covered Bridge closed an era in covered bridge building. This bridge was the last bridge built to be credited to Joseph A. Britton, he was 83, he would live to be 91. It was also the last of the historical covered bridges built in Parke County.

The hotel was also known as Wilson's Hotel and changed its name to the Great Eastern Hotel. It became the most famous hotel in India and is still functioning today as the Great Eastern Kolkata and is part of the Bharat Hotels Group. David Wilson came from Herefordshire and started a bakery at No. 1 Old Court House Street. The bakery was successful as it served the need of the Britishers from the East India Company who missed their breads and muffins in India. He subsequently bought the No. 2 and then No. 3 in Old Court House Road in 1840 to convert it into a hotel, which he had named after George Eden, the first Earl of Auckland.  Early & Personal Life  Wilson was born in Brilley, Herefordshire in 1808. He married Mary Mandy (n√©e Rose) in Calcutta in 1838. One of their grandchildren was Lieut Boyd Alexander the famous African explorer. David's sister Anne was in Calcutta and married one of David's friends, also a confectioner, Frederick William Browne in 1840 in Calcutta. Frederick died on 5 October 1864 on board the steamer Persia when it was lost at Sandheads in the great cyclone of 1864. David moved back to England in the 1860s but continued to manage the hotel. Over the ensuing years the hotel moved from strength to strength. In 1863 it became the first hotel in India to be fully electrified. Over the years famous guests have included Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain), Nikita Khruskhev and Queen Elizabeth II. When David died in 1880 his net worth was over ¬£60,000.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Jakath Rakshaka and his consort Lakshmi as Pushpavalli. The temple is believed to have been built by the Medieval Cholas of the late 8th century AD, with later contributions from Vijayanagar kings and Madurai Nayaks. A brick wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines and bodies of water. Jakath Rakshaka is believed to have appeared to sage Nandaka and King Ambarisha. Six daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmostvam, celebrated during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May‚ÄìJune), is the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Etymology As per Hindu mythology, demon Hiranyaksha fought with mother earth and went underground, called Patala. Vishnu was born as Varaha, an avatar in the form of a boar to pierced underground. He split the earth into two parts and brought the two back at Srimushnam. Thirumangai Azhwar quotes the incident and calls the village as Pugunthaan Oor, meaning the place where Vishnu went inside the earth. Since Vishnu protected the world here, he is called Jagad Rakshaka Perumal (in Tamil as Vaiyam Katha Perumal). The gap seen in the sanctum close to the image of Jagad Rakshaka is believed to be the centre point of earth and all devas came together to worship him. Since it brought all of them together, an act referred in Tamil as koodal, the village is called Thirukoodalur. Legend Temple thumb As per Hindu legend, King Ambarisha who immersed himself in the worship of Vishnu, failed to strengthen his army and lost his kingdom. While doing worship, he also did not observe the sage Durvasa who went along his way. The sage got irritated and cursed the king. The king went to Vishnu for rescue, who sent his discus to chase the sage. The sage surrendered to Vishnu and begged pardon. The king Ambarishan is believed to have built the temple and hence the presiding deity is also called Ambarisha Varadhar at this place.R. 1997, p. 481-2 As per another legend, all rivers come to river Kaveri for cleansing themselves. Kaveri wanted to cleanse herself and approached Hindu god Brahma. She is believed to have worshipped Vishnu at this place and got relieved. A parrot which was devoted to Vishnu was shot down in the nearby forest. Vishnu rescued the parrot and appeased him of his previous birth. Thus it is believed that Vishnu descends here for all forms of life. Vishnu is also believed to have appeared for sage Nandaka.Ayyar 1982, p. 533 Since all sages came here and prayed to Vishnu, the place is called Koodalaur (Koodal means group). The temple is called Vaiyam Katha Perumal as the presiding deity is believed to have saved the world. Architecture Image of Azhwars and shrines The temple is located four miles away from Ayyampet and is located on Kumbakonam - Tiruvayyaru Road. The temple is believed to have been built by the Medieval Cholas of the late 8th century AD, with later contributions from Vijayanagar kings and Madurai Nayaks. A brick wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines and bodies of water. The central shrine has the image of Jakath Rakshaka Perumal in standing posture. The shrine of the Pushpavalli faces South. The temple has a 3-tiered rajagopuram (gateway tower). There are separate shrines for Ramanuja, Azhwars, Andal and Garuda. The vimana, the tower above the sanctum, is called Suddha Satwa Vimana. A chariot called Ambarisha Ratha, renovated by Rani Mangammal, was in use till the 1940s, after which it was not used. There is a statue of the queen in the temple. Religious significance Jagad Rakshaka is considered the saviour deity and he is believed to descend for all forms of life in the planet. The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Azhwar in one hymn. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. The temple is associated with Ketu, one of the Navagrahas, the nine planet deities of Hinduism. While Vishnu sent his discus to chase the sage Durvasa, the other symbol of him, the conch, got prominence. The conch is believed to have appeared in the jack fruit tree behind the sanctum. Devotees worship the conch in the tree in the temple and during festive occasions, perform special rituals. Festival and religious practises thumb The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 6:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:30 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Jakath Rakshaka and Pushpavalli. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The Brahmotsavam festival celebrated in the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May‚ÄìJune) and Vaikunta Ekadasi celebrated during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December‚ÄìJanuary) are the major festivals celebrated in the temple. Srisukta Homam, a religious practice, is performed in the temple with 108 lotus leaves on full moon days.

At its height, the estate comprised around . However, it currently holds only around of ground. The house is currently under renovation, including an extension to the rear of the property. The house, along with the surrounding barns, is an example of an early model farm.  History  There has been human settlement at the site since 1280, when William Turgis established a farm there. The name 'Sturgeons' derived from the Turgis family-name. The location was chosen upon the discovery of a natural spring in the area. The current house was built in the 1830s in the Georgian style. It was built for William Addy, who spent the greater part of his fortune on the project. Due to ill health, he moved from the property soon after it was finished. The Blythe family then came to own the house and surrounding farmland for almost a hundred years. In the mid 19th century, Sturgeons farm became a leading model farm. The farm's owners researched and demonstrated improvements in agricultural techniques, efficiency, and building layout. Education, and commitment to improving welfare standards of workers were also aspects of the ideal farm movement. The farm buildings were designed to be beautiful as well as utilitarian - inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment. In the 1930s, Sturgeons farm (including Sturgeons House) was acquired by Writtle College. In recent times, the house has been the home of the Principal of Writtle College. In 2007 the college sold the property as part of its restructuring and modernisation programme. Sturgeons Farm is still retained by the college.  Wildlife  The area is rich in local wildlife. There are small badger and fox populations, along with Reeves's muntjac; moorhens; pheasants; hares and rabbits. There are also numerous oak, yew and willow trees.  Roman villa speculation  Excavation work in fields to the rear of the house has resulted in Roman pottery and metalware being discovered. Speculation that a Roman villa once existed on the site has yet to be verified. References * Susanna Wade Martins.

Contrast with verification.\\" * \\"Verification. The evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. It is often an internal process. Contrast with validation.\\"  Overview  Verification is intended to check that a product, service, or system meets a set of design specifications.\\"Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary,\\" ISO/IEC/IEEE std 24765:2010(E), 2010. verification 5. ...product, service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. In the development phase, verification procedures involve performing special tests to model or simulate a portion, or the entirety, of a product, service, or system, then performing a review or analysis of the modeling results. In the post-development phase, verification procedures involve regularly repeating tests devised specifically to ensure that the product, service, or system continues to meet the initial design requirements, specifications, and regulations as time progresses.\\"Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary,\\" ISO/IEC/IEEE std 24765:2010(E), 2010. verification 6. ...comply with requirements (e.g., for correctness, completeness, consistency, and accuracy) for all life cycle activities during each life cycle process (acquisition, supply, development, operation, and maintenance) It is a process that is used to evaluate whether a product, service, or system complies with regulations, specifications, or conditions imposed at the start of a development phase. Verification can be in development, scale-up, or production. This is often an internal process. Validation is intended to ensure a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) results in a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the operational needs of the user.\\"Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary,\\" ISO/IEC/IEEE std 24765:2010(E), 2010. validation (especially 1. & 2.) For a new development flow or verification flow, validation procedures may involve modeling either flow and using simulations to predict faults or gaps that might lead to invalid or incomplete verification or development of a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). A set of validation requirements (as defined by the user), specifications, and regulations may then be used as a basis for qualifying a development flow or verification flow for a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). Additional validation procedures also include those that are designed specifically to ensure that modifications made to an existing qualified development flow or verification flow will have the effect of producing a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the initial design requirements, specifications, and regulations; these validations help to keep the flow qualified. It is a process of establishing evidence that provides a high degree of assurance that a product, service, or system accomplishes its intended requirements. This often involves acceptance of fitness for purpose with end users and other product stakeholders. This is often an external process. It is sometimes said that validation can be expressed by the query \\"Are you building the right thing?\\"Barry Boehm, Software Engineering Economics, 1981 and verification by \\"Are you building it right?\\". \\"Building the right thing\\" refers back to the user's needs, while \\"building it right\\" checks that the specifications are correctly implemented by the system. In some contexts, it is required to have written requirements for both as well as formal procedures or protocols for determining compliance. It is entirely possible that a product passes when verified but fails when validated. This can happen when, say, a product is built as per the specifications but the specifications themselves fail to address the user's needs.  Activities  Verification of machinery and equipment usually consists of design qualification (DQ), installation qualification (IQ), operational qualification (OQ), and performance qualification (PQ). DQ may be performed by a vendor or by the user, by confirming through review and testing that the equipment meets the written acquisition specification. If the relevant document or manuals of machinery/equipment are provided by vendors, the later 3Q needs to be thoroughly performed by the users who work in an industrial regulatory environment. Otherwise, the process of IQ, OQ and PQ is the task of validation. The typical example of such a case could be the loss or absence of vendor's documentation for legacy equipment or do-it-yourself (DIY) assemblies (e.g., cars, computers etc.) and, therefore, users should endeavour to acquire DQ document beforehand. Each template of DQ, IQ, OQ and PQ usually can be found on the internet respectively, whereas the DIY qualifications of machinery/equipment can be assisted either by the vendor's training course materials and tutorials, or by the published guidance books, such as step-by- step series if the acquisition of machinery/equipment is not bundled with on- site qualification services. This kind of the DIY approach is also applicable to the qualifications of software, computer operating systems and a manufacturing process. The most important and critical task as the last step of the activity is to generating and archiving machinery/equipment qualification reports for auditing purposes, if regulatory compliances are mandatory. Qualification of machinery/equipment is venue dependent, in particular items that are shock sensitive and require balancing or calibration, and re-qualification needs to be conducted once the objects are relocated. The full scales of some equipment qualifications are even time dependent as consumables are used up (i.e. filters) or springs stretch out, requiring recalibration, and hence re-certification is necessary when a specified due time lapse. Re-qualification of machinery/equipment should also be conducted when replacement of parts, or coupling with another device, or installing a new application software and restructuring of the computer which affects especially the pre-settings, such as on BIOS, registry, disk drive partition table, dynamically-linked (shared) libraries, or an ini file etc., have been necessary. In such a situation, the specifications of the parts/devices/software and restructuring proposals should be appended to the qualification document whether the parts/devices/software are genuine or not. Torres and Hyman have discussed the suitability of non-genuine parts for clinical use and provided guidelines for equipment users to select appropriate substitutes which are capable to avoid adverse effects. In the case when genuine parts/devices/software are demanded by some of regulatory requirements, then re-qualification does not need to be conducted on the non- genuine assemblies. Instead, the asset has to be recycled for non-regulatory purposes. When machinery/equipment qualification is conducted by a standard endorsed third party such as by an ISO standard accredited company for a particular division, the process is called certification. Currently, the coverage of ISO/IEC 15408 certification by an ISO/IEC 27001 accredited organization is limited; the scheme requires a fair amount of efforts to get popularized. Categories of validation Validation work can generally be categorized by the following functions: * Prospective validation ‚Äì the missions conducted before new items are released to make sure the characteristics of the interests which are functioning properly and which meet safety standards. Some examples could be legislative rules, guidelines or proposals, methods, theories/hypothesis/models products and services * Retrospective validation ‚Äì a process for items that are already in use and distribution or production. The validation is performed against the written specifications or predetermined expectations, based upon their historical data/evidences that are documented/recorded. If any critical data is missing, then the work can not be processed or can only be completed partially. The tasks are considered necessary if: ** prospective validation is missing, inadequate or flawed. ** the change of legislative regulations or standards affects the compliance of the items being released to the public or market. ** reviving of out-of-use items. : Some of the examples could be validation of: :* ancient scriptures that remain controversial :* clinical decision rules :* data systems * Full-scale validation * Partial validation ‚Äì often used for research and pilot studies if time is constrained. The most important and significant effects are tested. From an analytical chemistry perspective, those effects are selectivity, accuracy, repeatability, linearity and its range. * Cross-validation * Re-validation/locational or periodical validation ‚Äì carried out, for the item of interest that is dismissed, repaired, integrated/coupled, relocated, or after a specified time lapse. Examples of this category could be relicensing/renewing driver's license, recertifying an analytical balance that has been expired or relocated, and even revalidating professionals. Re-validation may also be conducted when/where a change occurs during the courses of activities, such as scientific researches or phases of clinical trial transitions. Examples of these changes could be ** sample matrices ** production scales ** population profiles and sizes ** out-of- specification] (OOS) investigations, due to the contamination of testing reagents, glasswares, the aging of equipment/devices, or the depreciation of associated assets etc. :In GLP accredited laboratories, verification/revalidation will even be conducted very often against the monographs of the Ph.Eur., IP to cater for multinational needs or USP and BP etc to cater for national needs. These laboratories must have method validation as well.Method Validation; * Concurrent validation ‚Äì conducted during a routine processing of services, manufacturing or engineering etc. Examples of these could be ** duplicated sample analysis for a chemical assay ** triplicated sample analysis for trace impurities at the marginalized levels of detection limit, or/and quantification limit ** single sample analysis for a chemical assay by a skilled operator with multiplicated online system suitability testings  Aspects of validation  The most tested attributes in validation tasks may include, but are not limited to * Sensitivity and specificity * Accuracy and precision * Repeatability * Reproducibility * Limit of detection ‚Äì especially for trace elements * Limit of quantification * Curve fitting and its range * System suitability ‚Äì In a broad way, it usually includes a test of ruggedness among inter-collaborators, or a test of robustness within an organization However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specifically defined it for its administration, as \\"System suitability testing is an integral part of many analytical procedures. The tests are based on the concept that the equipment, electronics, analytical operations and samples to be analyzed constitute an integral system that can be evaluated as such. System suitability test parameters to be established for a particular procedure depend on the type of procedure being validated\\". In some cases of analytical chemistry, a system suitability test could be rather a method specific than universal. Such examples are chromatographic analysis, which is usually media (column, paper or mobile solvent) sensitive However to the date of this writing, this kind of approaches are limited to some of pharmaceutical compendial methods, by which the detecting of impurities, or the quality of the intest analyzed are critical (i.e., life and death). This is probably largely due to: :* their intensive labouring demands and time consumptionMoradi, Mehrdad, Bentley James Oakes, Mustafa Saraoglu, Andrey Morozov, Klaus Janschek, and Joachim Denil. \\"Exploring Fault Parameter Space Using Reinforcement Learning-based Fault Injection.\\" (2020). :* their confinements by the definition of the term defined by different standards. :To solve this kind of difficulty, some regulatory bodies or methods provide advice on when performing of a specified system suitability test should be applied and compulsory. Industry references These terms generally apply broadly across industries and institutions. In addition, they may have very specific meanings and requirements for specific products, regulations, and industries. Some examples: * Software and computer systems * Food and Drug ** Pharmaceuticals The design, production, and distribution of drugs are highly regulated. This includes software systems. For example, in the US, the Food and Drug Administration have regulations in Part 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Nash et al. have published a book which provides a comprehensive coverage on the various validation topics of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. Some companies are taking a risk-based approach to validating their GAMP system if one understands the regulatory requirements very well while the most of others follows the conventional process It is a part of GxP management. The aspects of validation and verification are even more intense and emphasized if an OOS occurs. Very often under this circumstance, a multiplicated sample analysis is required for conducting the OOS investigation in a testing laboratory. ** Medical devices The FDA (21 CFR) has validation and verification requirements for medical devices, as outlined in ASME V&V; 40\\\\. Also see guidance: and ISO 13485 ** Manufacturing process and cleaning validation are compulsory and regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ** Food hygiene: example ** Clinical laboratory medicine: ISO 15198:2004 Clinical laboratory medicine‚ÄîIn vitro diagnostic medical devices‚ÄîValidation of user quality control procedures by the manufacturer * Health care: example * Greenhouse gas: ISO 14064 ANSI/ISO: Greenhouse gases ‚Äì Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition * Traffic and transport ** Road safety audit ** Periodic motor vehicle inspection **Aircraft noise: example **Aircraft: * Model: * (Ni-Cd) cells: example * ICT Industry: example * Civil engineering ** Buildings ‚Äì ** Roads ‚Äì ** Bridges ‚Äì * Economics * Accounting * Agriculture ‚Äì applications vary from verifying agricultural methodology and production processes to validating agricultural modeling * Real estate appraisal ‚Äì audit reporting and authentication *Arms control See also * Certification of voting machines * Change control * Comparability * Data validation * Formal verification * Functional verification * ISO 17025 * Process validation * Software verification and validation * Statistical model validation * System testing * Systematic political science * Usability testing * Validation master plan * Verification and validation of computer simulation models  Notes and references  Further reading * External links * Maturity of verification and validation in ICT companies * Organisational maturity and functional performance Category:Quality management Category:Product testing Category:Systems engineering Category:Pharmaceutical industry Category:Food safety Category:Validity (statistics) ","title":"Verification and validation"},{"id":"13144612","text":"Silent Lies is a dramatic film about the violence and pain of incest and first love.

Early years Joe Falcon's last accordion, a pre-WWII German \\"Eagle\\" brand The first form of traditional cajun music began before the 20th century in south Louisiana. When the Acadians came from New Brunswick & Nova Scotia to Louisiana in 1764, they brought with them many beautiful ballads that told stories of bygone years. Many of these songs can be traced back to France and many songs from France drifted to the bayou and the prairie region via Nova Scotia and New Orleans. These ballads are not widely performed today, but were the basis of what is now accepted as cajun music. In the late 19th century, affordable accordions were introduced into Louisiana and were adopted by both Cajun and Creole musicians. Cajun and Creole musical styles at this time grew in parallel: mostly two-steps and waltzes meant for dancing, played by accordion and fiddle. Some of the first accordions imported in America were \\"Lester\\", \\"Pine Tree\\" and \\"Bruno\\" brands, but they were bulky, cheaply made and hard to play. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that Buegeleisen & Jacobson of New York City brought in from Rudolph Kalbes of Berlin, Germany the \\"Monarch\\", then the \\"Sterling\\", in the key of C and D.www.meloche.net \\"The Cajun Accordion Or Melodeon\\" These were assembled in Klingenthal, Saxony, Germany by several different families. They were \\"les 'tit noirs\\", meaning \\"the little black ones\\". They were a bit smaller than some of the older brands and were all black with pewter trim. They were the best ever at that time. The Sterling family bought the factory in about the 1920s, and then the Eagle family operated the factory, but both instruments were virtually the same as the Monarch, except for the name. During World War II, the Nazi government focused on building its war machine and closed down the accordion factories. Eventually, the factories were bombed by the allies, effectively ending the production of these accordions. Today, they are collectables. Early recording era (1920s through 1940s) Crowley 1938 The first recorded Cajun song, \\"Allons √† Lafayette\\" (\\"Let's Go To Lafayette\\") was recorded in 1928 by Joe Falcon and Cl√©oma Breaux. Standard versions of songs started to emerge due to the increase in the availability of phonographs. Some of the earliest recordings of Cajun music that exist were done in Louisiana during the late 1920s by noted historian and American folklorist Alan Lomax. Notable musicians during the time period include Falcon, Breaux, Am√©d√© Ardoin, Breaux Brothers, Segura Brothers, Leo Soileau accompanied by accordionist Mayuse (Maius) Lafleur or Moise Robin, and Dennis McGee accompanied by fiddler Sady Courville or Ernest Frug√©.Ancelet, Barry. (1994) Cajun Music. Journal of American Folklore, 107, 285-303.Nelson, Donald Lee. \\"Mama, Where You At?\\" The Chronicle of Maius Lafleur, John Edwards Memorial Foundation Quarterly 19(Summer 1983): 76-79 By the mid-to-late 1930s, a large influx of English speaking people came for the oil fields in Southwest Louisiana. Also, a large migration of French speaking Cajuns expanded to Texas. It was common for performers to sing in both French and English and borrow heavily from the popular country music and Texas swing music on the radio. Harry Choates recorded the first national Cajun hit song,\\"'Jolie Blonde\\", in 1946. Other groups from the 1930s and 1940s that were able to garner national attention include Leo Soileau and His Four Aces, the Hackberry Ramblers, Happy Fats and the Rhythm Boys, the Alley Boys of Abbeville, the Dixie Ramblers, and J. B. Fuselier and His Merrymakers. Choates' \\"Jolie Blonde\\", and Hank Williams' \\"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\\", which both used the melody of the Cajun song \\"Grand Texas\\", spawned regional and national interest in the music, opening the door to Nashville country music careers for Cajun musicians including Jimmy C. Newman, Rufus Thibodeaux, Doug Kershaw, and Jo-El Sonnier. The return of the accordion (1940s through 1970s) Dewey Balfa playing in Bordeaux, France in 1977 This era is named for the cultural \\"Cajun Renaissance\\" movement of the late 1960s to the present, a period in Louisiana of burgeoning pride in the local Cajun and Creole culture and interest in preserving the French language and uniquely Louisiana traditions. Important musicians in the years after World War II brought back the accordion as the lead instrument, following the string band era of the late 1930s and 1940s when the accordion was not featured on recordings. During the 1970s and beyond the trend continued, sometimes with elements of country-western music of the day and rock added to the sound. A performance by Dewey Balfa, Gladius Thibodeaux and Vinus LeJeune at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival was one major reason behind a revived interest in traditional Cajun music in the mid-1960s.Ancelet, Barry. (1992). The Cajun Music Festival: Genesis and Legacy. In Cajun Music and Zyedco, photographs by Philip Gould with introduction by Barry Ancelet. Baton Rouge, LA. Louisiana State University Press. In 1972, the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana started an annual festival that came to be known as Festivals Acadiens. When bands like the Balfa Brothers, Octa Clark and Hector Duhon, and the black Creole band Bois-Sec Ardoin and Canray began to appear and perform at prestigious national folk festivals like the Newport Folk Festival, the University of Chicago Folk Festival, and the National Folklife Festival, they inspired renewed interest in Louisiana in Cajun and Creole music, leading to the contemporary Cajun music scene. Musicians of note from the classic period of the 1940s through the 1960s include Iry LeJeune, Nathan Abshire, Lawrence Walker, Aldus Roger, Austin Pitre, Joe Bonsall, Adam Hebert, Robert Bertrand, Phil Menard, The Sundown Playboys, Badeaux and the Louisiana Aces, Rodney LeJeune, Belton Richard, and many others. Musicians such as Walter Mouton, Paul Daigle, Sheryl Cormier, Johnny Sonnier, Ed Gary, and Jackie Callier continue the tradition. This style of Cajun music is well documented by regional records producers such as Floyd Soileau (Swallow), J.D. Miller (Feature, Fais Do-Do), Eddie Shuler (Goldband), Lee Lavergne (Lanor), Carol Rachou (La Louisianne), and George Khoury (Khoury, Lyric). Jukeboxes, radio programs and TV spots in Cajun French helped publicize a band's work, making it easier to get jobs performing on the dancehall circuit in southwest Louisiana and East Texas. Contemporary era By the 1980s, a new sound of cajun music mixed with elements of rock, blues and R&B; was introduced to south Louisiana with Wayne Toups and Zydecajun. A new respect for Cajun culture developed in the 1990s. Among the most well-known Cajun bands outside of Louisiana is the multi-Grammy-winning BeauSoleil, who have joined several country music artists in the studio, and served as an inspiration to the Mary Chapin Carpenter hit, \\"Down at the Twist and Shout\\". Today \\"Modern traditionalist\\" Cajun band the Lost Bayou Ramblers Today, all forms of Cajun music can be heard, including those considered \\"modern traditionalists\\" who draw on a variety of elements from the broad history of Cajun and Creole music. From the 1990s to the present, artists such as Lee Benoit, Cory McCauley, Jason Frey, Mitch Reed and Randy Vidrine, Balfa Toujours, Ray Abshire, the Lost Bayou Ramblers, the Pine Leaf Boys, and Chris Miller have been popular with contemporary audiences while maintaining a connection with traditional forms. On June 7, 2007, the Recording Academy (NARAS) announced a new Grammy category, Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album, in its folk music field.

The Royal Stuart Society was established by Captain Henry Stuart Wheatly-Crowe, who served as its first Governor-General, and representatives of the Royalist Association and other defunct or moribund Jacobite bodies. It considers itself a successor to, and effectively the continuation of, bodies of the Neo-Jacobite Revival, such as the Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland (founded in 1891 by Herbert Vivian, Ruaraidh Erskine and Melville Henry Massue), the Order of the White Rose and the Thames Valley Legitimist Club. Among its other founders were Lionel Erskine-Young, 29th Earl of Mar (1891‚Äì1965) and Reginald Lindesay- Bethune, 12th Earl of Lindsay (1867‚Äì1939).Robert FJ Parsons, The Role of Jacobitism in the Modern World (Royal Stuart Society, Huntingdon, 1986) Objectives The objectives of the Royal Stuart Society are as follows: (1) to be open to all who have an interest in the members of the Royal House of Stuart, their descendants and supporters; (2) to promote research in and further knowledge of Stuart history; (3) to uphold rightful Monarchy and oppose republicanism; and (4) to arrange such commemorations, lectures and other activities as shall advance these objects. It describes itself on its website as being ‚Äúmonarchist and traditionalist‚Äù. the Governor-General was Murray, Duke of St Albans, the Chairman of the Council Julian, Lord Aylmer, and the Acting Principal Secretary Hugh MacPherson. Activities The Society organises a variety of events throughout the year. An important part of these events are the commemorations in Whitehall, Windsor and Westminster Abbey. Details of all these events, many of which are open to the public who are always made welcome, appear on the Society's website. A well-attended Service to commemorate the execution of King Charles I is held at his statue in Trafalgar Square on 30 January each year and a wreath is later laid on behalf of the Society on the King's tomb at St George's Chapel, Windsor at the beginning of Choral Evensong. The execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, is remembered with a Service at her tomb in Westminster Abbey on 8 February. The nativity of King James VII and II is marked by prayers and the laying of flowers at his statue outside the National Gallery on 14 October. The Society also holds an annual dinner which commemorates Restoration Day and White Rose Day. An informal party for members is usually held in November. The Society's lectures take place at the parish hall of the Jesuit church at Farm Street in London‚Äôs Mayfair. Newsletters with details of people, events and news of the Society are produced and edited by the Principal Secretary and sent to members during the year. The Society publishes the Royal Stuart Journal annually and this is available to non-members via the website. The Journal recently replaced a series of publications called Royal Stuart Papers (still available from the Society) which included papers by a number of well known historians such as Roy Porter, Richard Sharp, Murray Pittock, Eveline Cruickshanks, Lady Antonia Fraser and Ronald Hutton.

Refectory of the Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba, XVI. Friar Nicol√°s Borr√°s (1530-1610) was a Spanish Renaissance Catholic monk and painter, active in Valencia.  Biography  Borr√°s was born in Cocentaina, (Kingdom of Valencia), nowadays in the Province of Alicante. He is one of the best artists of Valencian monastic painting. Going to Valencia at an early age to study under Vicente Juan Macip, he became the latter's most noteworthy pupil. Borr√°s's works generally resemble those of Macip and some of them have been taken for his. Upon entering the priesthood he was assigned to the Hieronymite Monastery of Saint Jerome of Cotalba, in Gandia where he enjoyed his stay so much that he asked for membership in the order has his only payment.The paintings of Nicol√°s Borr√°s in the Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba \\"El arte de la Orden Jer√≥nima: historia y mecenazgo\\". Authors: Isabel Mateo G√≥mez, Amelia L√≥pez-Yarto, Jos√© Mar√≠a Prados Garc√≠a. Encuentro, 2000 . The Hieronymite monks of Cotalba called him to paint the greater altarpiece of the church. In this way, he entered in the order. The altarpiece consisted in fourteen tables. There was a sculpture of Saint Jerome in the middle. In addition, he made other altarpieces for the chapels of the church and the chapterhouse. Also he produced paintings for different parts of the monastery. He painted four great linens for the stations of the low cloister. However, the only work conserved in its original place was The Saint Supper painted in fresco. It is placed in what nowadays is known as the oil mill, that originally was the dining hall (refectory). He received the habit in 1575, and took the final vows the following year. Three years later, he spent some time with the Capuchins at the Franciscan monastery of San Juan de Ribera, near Valencia. He was soon back, however, at the Monastery of Saint Jerome of Cotalba in Gandia, where he passed the rest of his life painting, leaving twelve altar pieces in the church alone. He also spent his own money in the employment of sculptors and builders for the embellishment of the monastery. Borr√°s also did much work for churches and religious houses in Valencia, Madrid, and elsewhere. His paintings appeared in Saint Mary of Valencia Cathedral and at the Hieronymite monastery in the city of San Miguel de los Reyes where there was a \\"Christ at the Column\\", and a picture of the painter in adoration of \\"The Holy Virgin\\". Others were in the church of St. Stephen in Gandia, in the Escorial in Aldaia, and in Ontinyent. In the Museum of Fine Arts of Valencia there are some fifty paintings by Borr√°s chiefly from Gandia and San Miguel. Among them are The Last Supper, Christ Bearing His Cross, The Dead Saviour in the Arms of the Eternal Father, and The Archangel Michael Driving Souls into Purgatory and Hell. In the last Borr√°s is supposed to have pictured himself as a white-robed monk kneeling on the brink. He died, aged about 80, in the Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba, near Gandia.

According to the 2009 census (INE), the municipality had a population of 16,231. Although in a historically sparsely populated area, Sese√±a has gained some infamy as a result of controversial new speculative development projects in Vallegrande and El Qui√±√≥n during the Spanish property bubble. The municipality is nowadays composed of four sectors that are far away from each other and have no footpath connecting them, as is usual in Spanish towns. History The Battle of Sese√±a was an ill-fated Republican assault on the Nationalist stronghold of Sese√±a in October 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. The battle is notable for being the first time that tank warfare was seen in the Spanish war and for the use of Molotov cocktails against loyalist Soviet T-26 tanks by Francoist rebel troops.History of the Molotov cocktailThomas, Hugh (1994).

Begun during the construction boom of the 2000s (decade), due to the municipality's location within commuting distance of Madrid, it was to be one of the largest such developments in Spain, with an original plan of 13,500 units costing over 9 billion euros to build. However, the massive project raised eyebrows. Since utilities such as water and gas lines were not included in the plans, the completed units risked being uninhabitable. Also the project had been approved unusually quickly: it turned out that the authorities had been bribed, and the former local Mayor Jos√© Luis Mart√≠n was soon arrested, but never brought to trial.\\"Meltdown:Secret History of the Global Financial Collapse\\", Canadian CBC Investigative Television series, 2008.. Following scandal and the economic crisis related to the Spanish property bubble, the developer ran into trouble sustaining demand and financing for the project. By mid-2008 fewer than 3000 of the completed apartments had been sold and fewer than a third of the sold apartments were occupied, leaving the development a \\"ghost town\\" reminder of Spain's economic woes.\\"From boom town to ghost town\\", BBC News, 2008-08-27\\"How vulnerable is the Spanish economy?\\", BBC News, 2010-07-21\\"Sese√±a, phantom city in crisis\\" , photo essay from article, \\"Face √† la crise, Zapatero a-t-il tout faux?\\" by Ludovic Lamant, French language Magazine \\"Le Journal\\" 2009-12-21.

He is Professor of History and Classics and Head of the History Department at Pennsylvania State University. Kulikowski specializes in the history of the western Mediterranean world of late antiquity. He is a member of the Toronto School of History and a pupil of its leader Walter Goffart. Biography Kulikowski is a son of English-born computer engineer Casimir Alexander Kulikowski, and a grandson of the Polish-born inventor Victor Kulikowski. He received his B.A. (1991) from Rutgers University, and his M.A. (1992) and Ph.D. (1998) from the University of Toronto. He also gained a Licentiate of Mediaeval Studies (canon law) from the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in 1995. At the University of Toronto, Kulikowski was a student of Walter Goffart. Among his fellow students of Goffart were Andrew Gillett. After gaining his PhD, Kulikowski taught at Washington and Lee University, Smith College, and the University of Tennessee. Since 2009, Kulikowski has been Professor of History and Classics and Head of the History Department at Pennsylvania State University. Kulikowski's first book, Late Roman Spain and Its Cities, was published in 2004. He next work, Rome's Gothic Wars, was published in 2006, and is an introductory textbook on the relations between Goths and the Roman Empire in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. Bryan Ward-Perkins considered it a useful for students needing an introduction to the topic.. \\"For the most part, this is a sensible, clear and uncontroversial introduction to the subject, which deserves to be included on any student reading-list.\\" Kulikowski is the author of numerous articles, which range from the dependability of the Notitia DignitatumKulikowski, \\"The Notitia Dignitatum as an Historical Source,\\" Historia 49 (2000):358-77 as a historical source or ethnic self-identificationsKulikowski, \\"Roman Identity and the Visigothic Settlement in Gaul,\\" in R.W. Mathisen and Danuta Shanzer, edd., Culture and Society in Late Antique Gaul (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishers) 2001:26-38 to examination of the careers of various late Roman individuals. He is the editor of the forthcoming Landmark Ammianus Marcellinus. Theories Kulikowski belongs to the Toronto School of History, which is led by his former professor Walter Goffart. Kulikowski's views are closely in line with Goffart, who rejects the idea that Germanic peoples had any early history or that Germanic migrations had any impact on the fall of the Western Roman Empire. In Rome's Gothic Wars (2006), Kulikowski denies that the Goths had any history prior to the 3rd century AD. He considers all earlier archaeological, linguistic and literary evidence on the Goths as completely dependent upon Getica by Jordanes, and therefore of no value.. \\"[O]ne can find it stated that written sources, archaeology, and linguistic evidence all demonstrate that just such a migration took place, if not out of Scandinavia then at least out of Poland. In fact, there is just a single source for this extended story of Gothic migration, the Getica of Jordanes.\\". \\"It is only the text of Jordanes that leads scholars to privilege the Wielbark connection... The Gotones mentioned in Tacitus, Germania 44.1 and located somewhere in what is now modern Poland would not be regarded as Goths if Jordanes‚Äô migration stories did not exist.\\" According to Kulikowski, the Goths were mostly of non-Gothic descent, but were manipulated by the Romans into thinking that they were Goths. Ward-Perkins disagrees with this theory, as he finds it difficult to believe that such manipulation of identity is possible. Kulikowski advocates purging scholarly discourse from discussion of Germanic peoples, and replacing the term \\"Germanic\\" with \\"barbarian\\".. \\"The use of the term 'barbarian' is deliberate and surely non-pejorative. It is to be preferred programmatically to the noun 'German' and the adjective 'Germanic'. 'Germans' and 'Germanic peoples ' are the legacy of nineteenth-century philology.\\". \\"James is clearly correct in deciding to use ‚Äúbarbarian‚Äù as a technical term that avoids any implications about ethnicity... This is particularly welcome given the resurgence of ‚ÄúGermanic‚Äù as a catch-all term for northern barbarians... [T]he dogma of barbarian ethnogenesis ‚Äî first brought into English-language scholarship by Patrick Geary and now the dominant approach to the barbarians among early medievalists ‚Äî is really a way to bring long-distance migration from the Germanic north in by the back door.\\" Kulikowski believes that the history of the Goths and other \\"barbarians\\" should be \\"understood entirely as a response to Roman imperialism\\". He labels previous works on the Goths by Peter Heather, Herwig Wolfram, Volker Bierbrauer as \\"extreme\\", \\"neo-romantic\\", \\"bizarre\\" and \\"outlandish\\", and believes they \\"lack theoretical rigour\\".. \\"Bierbrauer‚Äôs simplistic ethnic ascription model is extreme, but only because it is articulated so clearly.\\". \\"Peter Heather‚Äôs Goths and Romans, 332‚Äì489 (Oxford, 1991) is the best treatment of its subject available in any language... Unfortunately, Heather‚Äôs more recent works... [advocate a] neo-Romantic vision of mass migrations of free Germanic peoples... [Heather] lack[s] theoretical rigour in relating archaeological and historical evidence.. \\"Herwig Wolfram‚Äôs History of the Goths... is the most widely available. Its mixture of outlandish philological speculation, faulty documentation, and oracular pronouncement remains very influential. Less bizarre, if wholly derivative, accounts of ethnogenesis are available in works by Wolfram‚Äôs Anglophone apostles...\\" Kulikowski also disagrees with Heather in the assumption that the invasion of the Huns was the primary cause of the migration period. He is highly critical of the ethnogenesis model of the Vienna School of History, which he considers \\"a way to bring long-distance migration from the Germanic north in by the back door\\". Kulikowski charges that German nationalist and Nazi influences have permeated scholarship on the Goths up to the present day, particularly through the theories of Gustav Kossinna.

Born in Hamilton, Ontario, she attended York University before publishing her first book, suitcases and other poems, which won the Hamilton and Region Arts Council Book Award. Over the next few years, she resided in Guelph, Ontario, where she helped found the Bookshelf Poetry Contest. Settling in Toronto, Bramer published scarf in 2001, a book of poems which tells the story of Vera, a single woman working in a scarf store in Hamilton. scarf received praise from Canadian literary critics, perhaps exemplified by the Antigonish Review's comment that it is an \\"intriguing book about loneliness and searching\\". 2005 saw Bramer's first book of poems published by Coach House Books, The Refrigerator Memory. Incorporating a broad range of imagery, the poems in The Refrigerator Memory were also well received. Currently, Bramer lives in Toronto with her husband and two daughters. Her latest publication is the full-length collection of poetry, Precious Energy. Style Bramer's poems are typically sparse in diction, and frequently \\"borrow from\\" and invent \\"fables and \\"fairy tales\\" - often surreal accounts of transpirations that occur on a day-to-day basis, as in \\"the psychology of a leaf\\" when she personifies leaves as if they were a human demographic. Her work differs significantly from both avant-garde Canadian poetry and more traditional, narrative poetry in that it is not pervasively influenced by either a particular school of experimentalism - Sound poetry, for example - or the Western literary canon. This is perhaps credible to her influences, which suggest a reliance more on oral tradition - the Mother Goose stories and rhymes being a good example, as they're transcriptions based on historically popular folk tales for children - than on conventional literary approaches. Another significant attribute of Bramer's poetry is that it is tonally feminine, as well as less aurally harsh than the poetry of her Canadian predecessors including Bronwen Wallace and Margaret Atwood. This tendency toward gentle or playful phrasing runs in stark contrast with the themes addressed in her work (and, by extension, generates a tension essential to her writing), which is often related to women's issues; as in scarf, when she uses alternatively gamesome and somber, sometimes superficially constructed bad verse to tell the story of Vera, a woman in her late twenties who works in a scarf store and is both painfully shy and suffering from angst as result of her social circumstances. Bramer has stated before that her style is partly indebted to nineteenth-century women writers such as Emily Dickinson, and, perhaps, Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Two literary ideologies that appear to inform Bramer's poetry are Surrealism and Imagism - the former in her tending towards surreal situations and lightness of tone (she has cited Charles Simic as a major influence), and the latter in her frequently imagistic verse, which often reflects Canadian poet Roo Borson's fixation on the image as a means to convey poetic content (though this approach is probably also influenced by Generation of '27 poets such as Federico Garc√≠a Lorca). Notably, Imagist poet Ezra Pound is alluded to ambiguously in her poem \\"Urban Restaurant\\", wherein he is fictitiously described as \\"Ezra, the new saucier.\\" Quotation: tricking the fever for Jeremy whenever we think of resurrection we think of lazarus rolling over mumbling sickness in his sleep, death (the idea of leaving) something we dreamt up like p a r a d i s e: the long word you repeated while feverish and still trying to be funny. love for someone ill becomes uncomplicated, this is what we dislike most about dying. you read my poem and said: this is wrong, my body is not a crushed flower Works  Poetry, Main Collections  * suitcases and other poems (Exile Editions, 1999, ) * scarf (McArthur & Co/Exile, 2001, ) * The Refrigerator Memory (Coach House Press, 2005, ) * Precious Energy (BookThug, 2017, )  Poetry, Chapbooks  * poem(s) on the stairs (above/ground press, 2002, ) * Fishings (BookThug, 2007, ) * Be Mine (BookThug, 2010, ) External links *Coach House Biography for Shannon Bramer *Quill & Quire review of The Refrigerator Memory *Canadian Literature review of The Refrigerator Memory *Antigonish Review review of scarf *Danforth Review review of scarf Category:1973 births Category:20th-century Canadian poets Category:21st-century Canadian poets Category:Canadian women poets Category:Living people Category:Writers from Hamilton, Ontario Category:20th- century Canadian women writers Category:21st-century Canadian women writers ","title":"Shannon Bramer"},{"id":"13144821","text":"Trogulidae is a family of harvestmen with 5 genera and 57 extant species and one fossil species. Members of this species have short legs and live in soil. They have dirt attached to their bodies, to escape predators. Their body length ranges from 2 to 22 mm. The body is in most genera somewhat flattened and leathery. Adults have a small hood, which hides their short chelicerae and pedipalps. (2007): Trogulidae Sundevall, 1833.

A couple of different sources give varying years as to when certain things may have happened; what is consistent is that the bridge was moved from its original location sometime after 1863 maybe due to the road being abandoned. Some claim that the bridge actually washed downstream to its new location where new abutments were put under it and a road built to it. Still others claim that because the creek changed its course the bridge had to be dismantled and moved. Yet another claim is that General Arthur Patterson, one of the founders of Rockville, had the bridge rebuilt by J.J. Daniels in 1867 after a viewing committee, which included Daniels, recommended it be rebuilt. Daniels also recommended moving the bridge to the Darroch's Site because it was thought to be safe from flooding.

In 1861 at the outbreak of the Civil War, Beard promptly left his life behind and moved west. Traveling through California, Oregon and Colorado he developed a nasty reputation as being good with a gun, and having a bad temper. By 1873 he had settled in Delano, Kansas, then a bustling town across the Arkansas River from Wichita, Kansas. He opened a successful saloon which for a time prospered. On October 27, 1873, he became angry with a prostitute who was in his saloon, but who worked across the street at the saloon owned by \\"Rowdy Joe\\" Lowe. He chased the girl outside, shooting at her. After chasing her across the street, still shooting, they entered the Lowe Saloon, where he accidentally shot and wounded a patron and another girl.

Ersatz-Division) was a unit of the German Army, in World War I.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army as, during the period of German unification (1866‚Äì1871), the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies. Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous and came under Prussian control only during wartime. The division was formed on mobilization of the German Army in August 1914.4\\\\. Ersatz-Division (Chronik 1914/1918) The division was disbanded in 1919, during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. Formation and recruitment The 4th Ersatz Division was formed on mobilization from 13 brigade replacement battalions (Brigade-Ersatz- Bataillone). Each brigade replacement battalion was numbered after its parent infantry brigade, and was formed with two companies taken from the replacement battalion of each of the brigade's two infantry regiments. Thus, collectively, the 13 brigade replacement battalions represented troop contributions from 26 different infantry regiments. The four battalions of the 9th Mixed Ersatz Brigade were from the Prussian Province of Brandenburg, as were the brigade's artillery, cavalry and pioneer formations. Two battalions of the 13th Mixed Ersatz Brigade were from the Prussian Province of Saxony, one was a mixed battalion from Prussian Saxony and the Duchy of Anhalt, and one was a mixed battalion from Prussian Saxony and the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg. The brigade's artillery, cavalry and pioneer formations were primarily from Prussian Saxony. The five battalions of the 33rd Mixed Ersatz Brigade, from the IX Army Corps area in northern Germany, were even more mixed: the 33rd Brigade Replacement Battalion was from the Hanseatic Cities of Bremen and Hamburg; the 34th from the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz; the 35th and 36th from Schleswig-Holstein; and the 81st from Schleswig-Holstein and the Hanseatic City of L√ºbeck. The brigade's artillery, cavalry and pioneer formations were mainly from Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Hamburg.Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935); Hartwig Busche, Formationsgeschichte der deutschen Infanterie im Weltkrieg 1914/1918 (1998). Combat chronicle The 4th Ersatz Division initially fought on the Western Front in World War I. It fought in the Battle of the Frontiers, seeing action in Lorraine and against the French defensive line from Nancy to Epinal. At the end of September 1914, the division was transferred from Lorraine to Belgium, where it participated in the Siege of Antwerp. After Antwerp fell, the division occupied the city and participated in follow-on fighting in Belgian Flanders. It fought in the Battle of the Yser and then went into the line on the Yser until November 1916. During this period, the division fought in the Second Battle of Ypres in April/May 1915 and in the Battle of the Somme in October 1916. It was in the trenchlines in the Somme region from December 1916 to February 1917. After fighting before the German Siegfried position, the division participated in the Battle of Arras. In late May 1917, the division was transferred to the Eastern Front. In July, it resisted the Russian Kerensky Offensive, and then participated in follow-on fighting in eastern Galicia. In December 1917, the division returned to the Western Front. It was in the trenchlines in Flanders and the Artois until April 1918, when it fought in the Battle of Armenti√®res, part of the Battle of the Lys, also known as the German Lys Offensive or the Fourth Battle of Ypres. The division later fought in the Second Battle of the Marne. Allied intelligence considered the division a fairly good division in 1917, but rated it third class in 1918, noting that it had not distinguished itself in the battles of 1918.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 96-98.

They recorded three albums between 1979 and 1986 as well as two additional albums, one a collaboration with Mani Neumeier and the other with Mayo Thompson. Plank died of cancer in 1987. Their final two albums were released posthumously in 1995 and 1998 respectively Musical style The first Moebius & Plank album Rastakraut Pasta was offbeat electronic music. Beginning with their second album, Material most of their music was highly rhythmic with a driving beat, with just some of it suitable for dance music. Like Kraftwerk their sound would be imitated by techno and electronica bands which followed but their music was far less pop and they were willing to push the artistic envelope. The third album, Zero Set, which added Guru Guru drummer Mani Neumeier, was heavily influenced by African music.  History   1969-1979 Kluster and Cluster  From 1969 until 1971 Moebius was a member of the pioneering experimental Krautrock band Kluster based in Berlin, together with Conrad Schnitzler and Hans-Joachim Roedelius. Konrad (Conny) Plank first worked with Moebius during the Kluster years, serving as engineer for their first two albums Klopfzeichen and Zwei-Osterei. When Schnitzler left Kluster the trio of Moebius, Roedelius, and Plank became Cluster. Plank is only credited with playing on the first album, Cluster (later reissued as Cluster '71), but he is listed as a composer of the music on Cluster II and continued to produce Cluster albums until 1978, including their two collaborations with Brian Eno. In September, 1979 Moebius & Plank went to Conny's Studio to record their first album, Rastakraut Pasta.  1980-1986 Moebius & Plank Recordings  Rastakraut Pasta was released in 1980 on the Hamburg-based Sky Records label. It featured offbeat and experimental electronic music, at times influenced by reggae as the album title suggests. All instruments and vocals are credited to Moebius & Plank except for bass on three tracks which was played by Can alumnus Holger Czukay. The second album, Material, was released by Sky in 1981 and featured driving electronic rhythms on most of the tracks. Steven and Alan Freeman, writing in The Crack In The Cosmic Egg describe the first two albums, in part, this way: \\"Their early albums as a duo were revelations of innovation, bringing unlikely combinations of industrial rock, cosmic and even dub music (on Rastakraut Pasta) together in a hybrid of genres. A reborn spirit of Krautrock that played recklessly with offbeat forms...\\" The incessant, forceful beat on \\"Conditionierer\\", the opening track of Material, could easily have been suitable for club dance music if not for all the odd electronic sounds added on top. In September, 1982, Moebius & Plank went back into the studio, this time joined by Guru Guru drummer Mani Neumeier. Plank had played guitar and keyboards on three Guru Guru albums and Neumeier had previously worked with Moebius on the Harmonia album Deluxe. The resulting album Zero Set was released on Sky in 1983 and was strongly influenced by African rhythms. Matthew Weiner describes it for Soulmind Online: \\"Though not a dance record per se, Zero Set is one of the earliest extensions of Krautrock‚Äôs possibilities on the dance floor, pitting the profoundly electronic sequence patterns of Plank and Moebius against the hyperactive percussives of Guru Guru drummer Mani Neumeier. On tracks such as the prophetically titled 'Speed Display' and 'Pitch Control', the phasing, chattering and decidedly Germanic grooves found on Zero Set constitute vibrant proto-techno at its earliest and finest.\\" Zero Set was a turning point for Moebius and Plank, a fact lamented by Steven and Alan Freeman. They say, in part: \\"...working with Mani Neumeier on Zero Set strangely took the music too close to techno for comfort, as does the more recently issued En Route. Moebius & Plank would return to the studio twice more in the mid 1980s but their efforts would not be released until well after Conny Plank succumbed to cancer in 1987. In 1983 Moebius & Plank recorded a series of electronic tracks using an Emulator, an early form of sampling keyboard that enabled them to duplicate other instruments without having to deal with the musicians who played them. Mayo Thompson of Red Krayola recorded a series of monologues and vocal tracks which were added to the music Moebius & Plank had recorded. Sky Records rejected the master and Ludwig's Law was regulated to the vault. It was finally released on 16 November 1998 on the Drag City label. Despite the rejection of Ludwig's Law by Sky, Moebius & Plank did decide to tour and perform the music, albeit without Mayo Thompson. Conny Plank fell ill while touring in South America. The final studio effort for Moebius & Plank was En Route, recorded at Conny's Studio in 1986. As Plank's health deteriorated the recordings were left incomplete. The album was completed and mixed by Moebius & Gebhard and released with three remixes by Manu Guiot added on the Dubuque, Iowa-based Curious Music label in 1995.

It is given to a person whom the authorities suspect may have committed an offence. This designation does not exist in certain other jurisdictions.e.g. \\"...there is no direct equivalent in UK law...\\" In a criminal investigation a person has to be declared an arguido prior to being arrested. Portuguese law makes a distinction between arguido and suspect. The rights of an arguido If a person becomes an arguido, they automatically gain certain rights that a witness or suspect would not have. An arguido has the right to be accompanied by a lawyer when questioned. The investigating police may ask the arguido more direct accusatory questions (the answers to which would not be admissible in court if possibly self- incriminatory and asked of a non-arguido) but the arguido must be presented with whatever evidence is held against them, and unlike a witness has the right to remain silent, not to answer any question that may incriminate the person, and does not face legal action for lying. Witnesses in criminal investigations are legally bound to co-operate with the police and do not have the right to silence and face legal actions if they lie. Because of the legal advantages, some individuals apply for arguido status to be given to themselves, e.g. when it would appear that the police suspect them but are trying to use their witness status to extract as much information as possible. A person who has arguido status has not been formally accused of a crime, arrested or charged, and not all arguidos are subsequently charged. The police may ask a court to restrict an arguido's movement and oblige them to not leave the country. Arguidos cannot change their place of residence, without permission from a court. There is no time limit on the status. Comparison with common-law administrations The status is very similar to that of being \\"questioned under caution\\" under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act in the United Kingdom or being questioned after being read one's \\"Miranda Rights\\" in the USA, specifically the right to legal representation, the liberty to refuse to answer questions, and the admissibility in court of statements taken whilst in those statuses. Etymology Arguido derives from the Latin arguire or arguere. The English words argue and argument have the same etymology.

They are a member of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL Canada) in the Atlantic Division. The team was one of two professional basketball teams from the province of New Brunswick, the other being the Moncton Magic. Established in 2007 as the Manchester Millrats (an expansion team based in Manchester, New Hampshire, which played in the American Basketball Association (ABA), a year later it moved to the Premier Basketball League (PBL). In 2010, it relocated to Saint John and in 2016 was renamed. In 2019, the team was granted a one-season hiatus by the league. History 2007‚Äì08 season In their inaugural ABA season, the Manchester Millrats compiled a regular season record of 28‚Äì12, playing their home games at the Fieldhouse of Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). They won their first 12 games and first four games against the reigning champion Vermont Frost Heaves. These were the only losses the Frost Heaves had in that season. The Millrats were one of eight teams to make the post season. They got to the semifinals but lost in overtime to the San Diego Wildcats. Larry Lessett was the head coach. There were major logistical issues, as two of the four teams in the Millrats' division suspended operations. The ABA flew the Millrats to the Bahamas once and to Singapore twice to play against ABA teams with no local competition. Nevertheless, Millrats management organized additional games against local rivals and gave season ticket owners the full number of events they had been promised, although the final regular season game was played at a private center ten miles away. Point guard Anthony Anderson got the ABA's Most Valuable Player award among other awards and recognition. Ian McCarthy was named the league's General Manager of the Year. Ismael Caro and Ife Anosike were separated from the team after a brawl that brought a game in Vermont to a premature end. 2008‚Äì09 season The logistical problems of the ABA led the Millrats to join the Premier Basketball League, with teams from Vermont, Quebec City, and Halifax. The 20-game PBL regular season began in January 2009. The Millrats and three other teams from the PBL's Atlantic Division added 6 exhibition games apiece in pursuit of the \\"Champlain Cup.\\" The Millrats played three other exhibitions, including two against the Arecibo Captains of Puerto Rico. Owner Jason Briggs bought a mansion in Manchester and remodeled it to contain sauna, steam rooms, a dinner table on stilts, and custom, seven-foot bunks. Players and coaches resided there and the garage became the business office. Sam Carey joined P.J. Young as Millrats who had played college basketball on the same home court for SNHU. Ife Anosike rejoined the Millrats, left at mid-season to pursue a nursing career, but returned for the playoffs. The Millrats started the PBL regular season with two road losses, but lost only two other games and finished the regular season at 16‚Äì4, atop the Atlantic Division. The team was undefeated at home, and undefeated in February, for which Rob Spon got the PBL Coach of the Month award and Desmond Ferguson got a Player of the Week award. On February 5, the PBL suspended the Montreal Sasquatch and conducted a dispersal draft on February 7. The Millrats selected Jamaal Wise. On March 9, the Millrats traded Wise and other considerations to Quebec for power forward John Ruffus, whom Quebec selected in the same dispersal draft. This was called the PBL's first in-season player trade. On February 13, the Millrats played a scheduled home game against a Montreal team with new roster and ownership. Vermont remained the principal rival; many Vermont fans made the 130-mile drive. A showdown on February 15 enthused 1052 fans.Kevin Gray, \\"Millrats Love Home Cooking,\\" Manchester Union-Leader, February 16, 2009. February's winning streak ended on March 6 with an overtime loss to Vermont in Burlington, but the Millrats clinched the Atlantic Division the next day in Quebec. Third-seeded Manchester met the second-seeded Rochester RazorSharks for the best-of-three PBL semifinals. The RazorSharks delayed the third and deciding game four days, blamed on a malfunctioning backboard, and won the game to eliminate the Millrats. Millrats point guard Al Stewart shared post-season honors for the PBL Defensive Player of the Year. 2009‚Äì10 season The PBL had massive turnover of franchises and began the 2009‚Äì10 season reduced from 13 to 9 teams, playing as a single division. Four teams of the old Atlantic Division returned, except the problematic Montr√©al franchise. But the entire Midwest Division disappeared. Battle Creek, with the league's best record, quit the PBL over the PBL's decision to hold a one-game league championship in Rochester, denying Battle Creek up to two home dates, and over disagreement over compensation for this decision. In the Eastern Division, Rochester and Buffalo returned, but the Wilmington franchise left, reportedly over loss of nearby competitors. However, the Maryland GreenHawks (formerly the Nighthawks) came out of dormancy, and the PBL picked up the Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry from the Continental Basketball Association; and the Capitanes de Arecibo, from the Baloncesto Superior Nacional league of Puerto Rico. Heath Teixeira was promoted to head coach. An exposure combine on October 24‚Äì25, 2009, drew over 70 athletes. The Champlain Cup became a three-team tournament hosted by the Vermont Frost Heaves from December 27‚Äì29 against the Millrats and the Qu√©bec Kebs. The Millrats won the Cup with lopsided victories. The team played no exhibition games at home. Among players from the previous season, only Al Stewart and Marlowe Currie started the regular season with the Millrats, and they were not with the team by late January. Charles Mason trained with the team and joined the roster in late January, as did P.J. Young. Anthony Anderson rejoined the team after a year's absence, and Charles Easterling joined in mid-season. The Millrats drafted Tyrece Gibbs and Eric Gilchrese, alumni of the University of New Hampshire, with their picks in the PBL player draft. The signing of Luke Bonner on January 15 spurred media interest, as Bonner is from Concord, New Hampshire, and is the brother of Matt Bonner of the San Antonio Spurs. But he played only the weekend of January 16‚Äì17 before going to the Austin Toros in the NBA Development League. On January 21, Currie was traded to Halifax. Admission to the SNHU Fieldhouse remained at $10 ($90 for a ten-game season ticket), but the bleachers on one side were replaced by $17 courtside seating. Mascot Millie the Millrat was not seen, but a dog mascot took his or her place, wearing 00. One home game was moved to Hesser College, and one was moved to UNH, as it featured Keith Friel of the visiting Rochester Razorsharks (the son of former UNH Head Coach Gerry Friel) and the two UNH alumni mentioned above for the Millrats. 2010‚Äì11 season Saint John Mill Rats logo In May 2010, a report surfaced that the Millrats ownership was looking to leave Manchester for Saint John, New Brunswick, saying that seating and concessions in the arena were the main impetus for moving. On June 21, 2010, a press conference was held at Harbour Station in Saint John to officially announce the move. A naming contest was held in conjunction with Rogers Communications titled \\"Got Name?\\" where fans could text their choice of name via text-messaging. The choices for the names were: Millrats, Fog, Shamrocks, Fire, and Rip Tide. The fans could also select their own. On July 27, Ian McCarthy, president of the team, announced that with overwhelming support, the Mill Rats moniker would remain the same, although a space was added between the two words. A new logo was also unveiled. The Mill Rats were in contention for most of the regular season, but finished with a record of 9‚Äì11, in 5th place, one game out of the playoffs. The playoffs were notable for New York state-based referees traveling to work several away games involving the Rochester Razorsharks (which share a common owner with the PBL). When this, an uneven number of foul calls, and a final game terminated prematurely by fan reaction marred the semifinal series in Quebec, McCarthy (who had chafed at out-of-state referees during the 2009 playoffs) wrote a protest letter to the league on behalf of his and the other Canadian teams. The same events recurred in the final series, which concluded in the Mill Rats and Rainmen quitting the PBL moments after the playoffs ended. The Kebs followed suit one day later, with Lawton-Fort Sill suspending operations. NBL Canada: 2011‚Äìpresent On 12 May 2011, the Mill Rats (along with the existing Halifax and Qu√©bec teams of the PBL) were announced as founding members of the National Basketball League of Canada. On 12 October, the Mill Rats announced the signing of former Detroit Pistons guard Will Blalock. The team looked forward to intense interest for the season given the 2011 NBA lockout. After the 2015‚Äì16 season, the NBLC announced that the Mill Rats ownership group would no longer continue to operate the team. It voted unanimously to transfer the ownership of the Saint John team to a local ownership group called Saint John Pro Basketball headed by Scott VanWart, Mike Cormier and Paul Vaughan. The new ownership group retained on-and-off franchise head coach, Rob Spon. On 26 October, the new ownership announced the rebranded team would be called the Saint John Riptide. Spon would leave Saint John after the 2016‚Äì17 season to coach the Cape Breton Highlanders. The Riptide then hired Nelson Terroba as head coach after he had previously served as an assistant with the Erie BayHawks of the NBA Development League.

According to the 2007 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 5,995 inhabitants. Llerena, a town that declared itself a Historical Artistic gathering on December 29, 1966, is located in southwestern Spain. The head of the judicial and economic center of the Region of the country of the same name, it is equidistant from 20 municipalities, and sits at the confluence of the District 432 and 413 National Roads. History Arab Period In the time of the Arabs it was called Ellerina, a place contested between Arabs and Christians. It was definitively occupied in the year 1243 by Pelayo P√©rez Correa, master of the Order of Santiago, to whom Ferdinand III of Castile had entrusted the reconquest of Sierra Morena. Order of Santiago The settlement was given to the Order of Santiago, to provide for its defense and resettlement. The masters of the order granted Fueros in 1297. The tradition emerged that the masters of the order use Llerena as their temporal residence. The most noteworthy masters who resided there were: * The prince Don Fadrique (1342-1358), half-brother of King Peter I of Castile. * Don Pedro Fern√°ndez Cabeza de Vaca (1382-1387) * Don Enrique Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez of Villagarc√≠a (1385-1387) * Lorenzo Su√°rez de Figueroa (1387‚Äì1409), master buried in the Church of our Lady of Grenada * Don Alonso de C√°rdenas (1480-1493), last of the masters of the Order of Santiago. His sepulchre is also in the city. Llerena was the habitual residence of the Masters of the Order of Santiago, and this fact favoured the city in the 15th century, when it became capital of the Priory of the Hostal San Marcos de Le√≥n. For this reason it was the most important center of the territory, which until then had been Reina. So much was its increase in importance that it became the most important administrative center of the Leon province of the order of Santiago in Extremadura, the headquarters of the Maestral order table, and the principal town of the more than 30 towns governed from Llerena and dependent upon the Prior of the Order of San Marcos in Le√≥n. In the year 1340, King Alfonso XI of Castile presided over the Cortes in Llerena. In 1383, Pedro Fern√°ndez celebrated the General Chapter of the Order of Santiago in Llerena, with the assistance of all of the Order's commanders. The Master of the Order Lorenzo Su√°rez de Figueroa received the license to hold the San Mateo fair on September 21, built the chapel of the Trinity in the Church of Granada, built the bastimentos, and finished the building designed to be the Casa Maestral or the convent of Santa Elena. Enrique Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez of Villagarc√≠a built the castle in the neighboring town of Villagarc√≠a de la Torre, and became the patron of the chancel of the Church of Santa Maria, and decided to be buried in it. Alonso de C√°rdenas built the Church of Santiago on the site occupied by the shrine of Saint Peter, and gave to the walled enclosure some of the most important gates of the city. Having once been a Muslim territory, its reconquest produced a repopulation by Leonese, Basque and Cantabrian families. But an important core Jewish population also emerged within the city, and made it a prosperous city with high economic and cultural achievements. A peaceful coexistence emerged among the three cultures: Christians, Jews and Muslims. In the year 1479, the Jewish leader Rab√≠ Mayr persuaded Isabella to remove the ban on Jews holding fairs and markets that existed in the Kingdom of Castile. This improved the economic levels of the city and allowed creation of the school of translators. At this time there were 600 Jewish families in Llerena, who lived in the vicinity of the synagogue (Chapel of Santa Catalina). In 1490, the final Chapter General of the Order of Santiago was held, started in Ucl√©s. It was called by the order's last master before that role was incorporated into the power of the Spanish Crown. After Isabella signed the Decree of Expulsion of the Jews in 1492, 125 Jewish families remained in Llerena and became Jewish converts to Christianity. Inquisition Court In 1508, the Tribunal del Santo Oficio of the Inquisition court was instituted. Obtained by the influence of the degree Luis Zapata, Director and Advisor to Isabella, it was aided by the existence of Jewish population in the lower Extremadura. It was the third Court of Spain, as regards the extension of its jurisdiction. It occupied 42.260 square kilometers, and included the bishoprics of Ciudad Rodrigo, Piacenza, Coria, and Badajoz. Occupying three headquarters in Llerena, the Priory Palace in Zapater√≠a Street, the House maestral Street La Prison and finally, until its abolition in 1834, Palace of the Zapata, now justice in la Corredera Street today. Its period of maximum splendor was in the 16th century that had seven convents, as well as a great cultural activity. During this century there was a large population increase only diminished by certain emigration to the new world, becoming the second largest population centre of Extremadura in 1591 behind capital Badajoz. At the end of the century had 8,300 inhabitants. In 1594, the census of population in the provinces and marches of the Crown of Castile in the 16th century was part of the Leon province and had 2,066 neighbors, including its suburbs of Llerena such as Maguilla. In the year 1640, due to the growth it had achieved, Philip IV granted Llerena the title of City. Decline By the end of the 17th century began the city's decline influenced by several factors: the political crisis in the Spanish Empire, war with Portugal, little suitable local rulers, the Moorish expulsion and successive plagues which kept isolated from the outside during quarantine. 18th century achieved during the municipal independence places of Higuera de Llerena in 1786 and Maguilla in 1749, which had previously belonged to its City Council. Independence During the War of Independence (1808-1814), on the occasion of the Battle of Cantalgallo in 1810, produced a large destruction of the city. There were many buildings damaged and part of the archive was destroyed, and served as the seat to the chivalry, large number of works of art were plundered, as part of the altar of the Church of our Lady of Granada Zurbar√°n. The fall of the old disappeared the Order of San Marcos in Le√≥n, ceased to hold office in Llerena the Governor of the province and the party and decreed the abolition of the Holy Office in 1834 of the Inquisition. Then this city was in northeastern Extremadura and 1834 was capital and headquarters of the judicial district of Llerena. Schism After the Decree of suspension of the religious jurisdiction maintained centuries the military orders, Llerena produced the \\"schism\\", caused by the clergyman Don Francisco Maesso's jurisdiction of the bishopric of Badajoz. In just over a year there were several altercations that subsided when Alfonso XII to the throne, leading to the disappearance of that decree for Llerena. Reposessions The successive ground and building confiscations produced a great misfortune for the municipal economy of Llerena and to the rest of the neighborhood. Of Juan √Ålvarez Mendiz√°bal of 1837 and Madoz in 1855, it was left almost without resources to the municipality of Llerena. He lost the dehesas of their property that he had maintained and exploited for centuries by providing significant benefits for the municipal coffers. Some convents, such as those dedicated to Santa Isabel, San Francisco, La Merced, San Sebastian, and La Concepci√≥n disappeared, leaving only the Santa Clara convent. During the 19th century, some industries that remained in the city together with the construction of the railway line M√©rida-Sevilla, in the second half of the century until its conclusion in the last section in 1885 between Llerena and El Pedroso, contributing to the economic progress of the region.

The nearest Montreal Metro station is Monk. History Founded on July 19, 1881,The Douglas is 125 years old, press release, Montreal, July 19, 2006 by Alfred Perry and a group of Protestant clergy and Montreal citizens, the Douglas Institute was originally named the \\"Protestant Hospital for the Insane.\\"The Douglas is 125 yearsAlfred Perry of Montreal testifies at the trial of John Wilkis Booth (the Trial of the Conspirators, page 33) At the time, Montreal had another psychiatric hospital, but it was a francophone Catholic hospital, and the Douglas was meant to offer psychiatric services to the anglophone Protestant minority. The founders put an advertisement in the local newspaper to seek funds for a new building to be constructed, and local philanthropists offered generous donations. In 2006, the Douglas was designated a University Institute in Mental Health. It is named in honour of James Douglas (1800‚Äì1886) and his family. Douglas (whose family name is sometimes spelled Douglass) was a Scottish-born physician who practiced in Quebec City and was involved in the foundation of the Asile de Beauport. Mission A view of the gardens of the hospital The Douglas provides specialized mental health care services for the very young to the elderly. It contributes to destigmatizing mental illness through its public education program: among them, Mini-Psych Schoolhttp://www.douglas.qc.ca/page/mini-psych-school and Frames of Mind film festival. In keeping with prevention and recovery principles, the Douglas contributes to the advancement of knowledge and best practices through state- of-the-art research and teaching. It also respects the basic human rights of patients, as stated in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights, keeping them in the hospital against their will, if they prove to be a danger to themselves or others in accordance with the Quebec Justice system.Information on mental health Infrastructure and patient care The Reed Pavilion takes in patients who call to receive treatment through the Emergency. It consists of an Intensive Care Unit on the right side and Psychiatric Emergency on the left. Patients are held there for evaluation by a psychiatrist. Usually after diagnosis, if the patient accepts the treatment, he will stay until well enough to return to society. If the patient refuses treatment and the evaluating psychiatrist deems him a risk to himself or society, the patient and psychiatrist are heard by a judge who will confirm or deny a temporary involuntary commitment order. If returned to the hospital, the patient is usually transferred to another unit. One of these units is called the \\"Centre Psychiatrique Communautaire\\" (The Psychiatric Community Centre) or CPC2. The CPC2 is a place where patients usually stay for a maximum 20 days until they can re-enter the community. Sometimes through court order, the patient may stay longer. The patients receive free room and board, there are 2 TVs for entertainment, a radio, some gym equipment, and some board games. The patients are given their medication at appropriate times and must usually stay until the psychiatrist gives clearance to leave. Foundation The Douglas Mental Health University Institute Foundation is a nonprofit organization that seeks donations for the Douglas Mental Health University Institute. The Douglas Institute is the second largest mental health research centre in Canada. With the support of the Foundation, it is better able to carry out its mission: care for patients with mental illness, research into neuroscience to uncover the causes of mental illness and improve treatments, and knowledge transfer between practitioners in the mental health field. The Foundation‚Äôs most recent contribution was towards a $20 million brain imaging centre that was scheduled to open in 2011. It also funds the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre. As much as the Institute relies upon the Foundation‚Äôs support, the Foundation remains an independent public organization. The Douglas Institute Foundation was created in 1972. Its mandate was to collect and manage donations through the help of volunteers. Today, the Foundation is led and supported by a Board of Directors made up of 24 members who are elected at the Foundation's annual public assembly. As Dr. Gustavo Turecki says \\"The big difference at the Douglas Institute is that clinicians are also researchers.\\" The Institute is unique in the collaborative and comprehensive approach of its 67 researchers and practitioners that includes prevention, treatment, and public intervention. The Institute houses ongoing studies about the genetic component of mental illness and the environmental triggers, that, when combined with a certain genetic predisposition, can make certain individuals more vulnerable. When an illness manifests itself, sufferers and family members are able to seek specialized treatment and support at the Institute, whether through an initial diagnosis at its own emergency room or by referral from a healthcare professional. To further develop understanding of mental disorders, the Institute studies public access to and usage of available resources so that these can be improved and mental illness better treated and prevented. Maison Claude-Laram√©e Douglas Institute helped in creating Maison Claude-Laram√©e (MCL) in Verdun, in the Montreal area. MCL is a rehabilitation residence for people who have severe long-lasting psychotic illness and also drug or alcohol abuse or dependence. Serving nine people at a time, in single rooms, MCL is jointly run by Douglas Institute and the Old Brewery Mission. The day-to-day operations are managed by staff members of the Old Brewery Mission, which is a Montreal organization serving homeless and poor people. Costs for each bed are about $25,000 per year. This compares to about $300,000 per year for a patient to occupy a bed in a hospital. Almost all residents are on welfare, and pay about $8,000 per year to stay there, out of their monthly welfare cheques. The rest of the costs are subsidized.

The channel's logo originally consisted of three- dimensional graphics forming a face, but when the channel relaunched in 1987, it was changed to a colourful pastel butterfly graphic along with a signature flute tune, typifying the gentle pace and reflective style of the channel as a whole. History Lifestyle was launched on 30 October 1985 and was initially available on cable networks such as Rediffusion Cablevision in parts of the United Kingdom and Cablelink in parts of Ireland. Lifestyle's daytime lineup mainly consisted of magazines, novelas and movies. The programming was linked by an in-vision continuity announcer, David Hamilton. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the channel was showing a range of classic American comedies and crime dramas such as Divorce Court and Remington Steele along with film noir classics from the 1940s and 1950s. In 1990, the transponder was used to broadcast the Lifestyle Satellite Jukebox, a music video request channel from 10.00pm to 6.00am. The hours between the ending of Lifestyle's programmes and the start of Satellite Jukebox were filled by Sell-a-Vision home shopping programmes. For a time, The Children's Channel also transmitted on transponder 5, airing during the early morning before Lifestyle programming started. In the early 1990s, Lifestyle's transmission time was extended and it aired 10.00am to 6.00pm. The channel became more associated with the Sky Television brand by becoming part of its advertising campaigns for the Astra satellite on which all Sky channels and Lifestyle could be seen. The channel was airing the successful chat show Sally Jessy Raphael along with several popular American gameshows including Classic Concentration, The Joker's Wild, Tic-Tac-Dough and Supermarket Sweep. More recent programming was also acquired, and Australian series including Rafferty's Rules, Cop Shop and Skyways aired along with American soap operas Search for Tomorrow and The Edge of Night. Closure The channel's fate was sealed because it never achieved huge ratings, and Lifestyle closed down on 24 January 1993, with its most popular shows moving to Sky One and a new channel for women launched a few months later called UK Living on the Sky Multichannels package. Astra transponder 5's programming was replaced the following day by a German language channel, VOX.

According to the 2006 census (INE), the municipality had a population of 5327 inhabitants. Toponymy In 1557 king Philip II granted it the charter of town (in Spanish villa). At the beginning of being populated, it was allowed to be free of taxes (frank) for six years. The wording \\"de los Caballeros\\" would be added to the name of \\"Villafranca\\" because of some customary events from the time of Middle Ages. \\"It happened every year, the day of St. Martin, that the representatives of all villages and towns belonging to the Order of the Knights of St. John gathered at the place, to deal with the use of community pastures. In the gathering, representatives would answer when asked: ... may speak now the gentleman from ...\\". And for holding, even if it was only for a day, attending people who was considered to be gentlemen (caballeros in Spanish), the town received that surname. So the place became known as \\"Villafranca de los Caballeros\\". There is a handful of other towns that are also called Villafranca (frank town), but hey, there's only one Villafranca de los Caballeros in all Spain. This information has been extracted from the old file Descriptions of Cardinal Lorenzana, 1784. I'm not sure of how to write the reference. History According to the few excavations carried out, the first settlers in Villafranca were the Iberians. If you can read Spanish, that's what most of people say about the town. Actually the studies carried out have been very limited and there are certain traces of settlers from Stone Age. So, that the only studied archaeological sites may have been so far of Iberians from the 7th and 6th centuries B.C. doesn't mean they were the very first to settle in the area. Also, the sites are much far from the current town's historical center. Speaking about this zone, the first mention of this place dates back to Muslim invasion, where Muslims and Christians did coexist in the area called today Cruz de Lozano. Then, by 1085, Toledo was conquered by the Christian king Alfonso VI. At the same time, Consuegra was also recovered by the Christians, and Villafranca gets to depend of it. Consuegra is handed over to the Order of the Knights of St. John. Villafranca as well as other towns becomes a property of the order. Since then, the town would depend in one way or another from the Order until the ecclesiastical confiscations of the 19th century in Spain, when the Order properties in Spain were seized and the Grand Priory was ended. Heritage Parish Church of Our Lady of the Assumption This is the most important monument in the town. Its construction began back in the 13th century as a Romanesque church, but was later modified and enlarged in the 16th and 18th centuries with the addition of some gothic elements, like a central rib vault. Chapel of the Saint Christ of St. Anna Current building is the result of the enlargement, at the beginning of the 18th century (or perhaps at the end of the 17th), of an old chapel, which was devoted to St. Anna, the mother of the Virgin Mary. The original carving of the Christ was found in the basement of that primitive chapel (perhaps buried there during the Muslim invasions to protect it). By then it was known as St. Christ of the True Cross. But because it was found in the chapel of St. Anna, people started to call it by that name as well. Today, the ancient name can only be found in old writings, and everybody in the town call it St. Christ of St. Anna. Little is known exactly about the date the original chapel was built. We have some references it already existed in 1691. Studies are being made by historians in old archives to find out the truth, but so far all we know is from its legend more than history. Today's building was designed like a salon in the baroque style. The interior was covered with paintings, but in 1993 the paintings from the walls were removed because a severe problem of humidity. Paintings still can be seen in the vaults of the ceilings.

He is the founding spiritual leader of the Contemporary Chassidic Congregation Aish Kodesh in Woodmere, New York, and Mashpia/mashgiach ruchani (spiritual supervisor) at Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS). Considered the \\"senior spokesman\\" of the Neo- Hasidic movement in Modern Orthodoxy, he has recorded more than 4000 lectures on Hasidic thought and philosophy. Early life and education Moshe Weinberger grew up in a Modern Orthodox home in Queens, New York. His father, Mordechai Aryeh Yosef \\"Martin\\" Weinberger (March 24, 1923 - February 10, 2020), and his mother, were both Holocaust survivors from Munkacs and Ungvar, and his grandparents were Belzer Hasidim. He began studying Hasidic works after his Bar Mitzvah. Although he originally planned a career in law, he discontinued his law studies to train for the rabbinate, receiving rabbinic ordination from RIETS, where he was a student of Rabbi Dovid Lifshitz and Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik. He also studied at Yeshivat Sh'or Yoshuv. He earned master's degrees in Jewish philosophy from the Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies at Yeshiva University, and in educational administration from Columbia University Teachers College. Early career Weinberger began his career as a rebbi (teacher) at a yeshiva in Far Rockaway. He taught for two decades at Ezra Academy, a Jewish day school in Queens, and also served as a mashgiach ruchani for N'vei Tzion of Queens. Congregation Aish Kodesh In December 1992 Weinberger became the first rabbi of Congregation Aish Kodesh in Woodmere, New York. He named the synagogue after Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, the Piaseczna Rav and author of the work Aish Kodesh (Holy Fire), who was a leading Polish Hasidic rabbi in prewar Europe. Noting that religious Jews may follow the letter of the law without feeling its inner joy or a personal connection with God, Weinberger preaches the tenets of Hasidism to rekindle excitement and joy in Jewish observance. He leads the congregation in song and dance after prayer services, conducts tishen, officiates at an annual hillula celebration on the yahrtzeit of the Piaseczna Rav and on Lag BaOmer, which each draw more than 1,000 attendees, and takes congregants on pilgrimages to kivrei tzaddikim (graves of tzadikim) in Ukraine and Israel. The synagogue building itself is modeled after a Polish Hasidic shtiebel. Congregation Aish Kodesh has been called a \\"phenomenon\\" and a \\"revolution\\" in the Modern Orthodox community of Long Island.Besser, Yisroel. \\"Breslov Revisited\\". Mishpacha, May 12, 2010, pp. 30-40. In 2013 Weinberger was appointed mashgiach ruchani (spiritual supervisor) at Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, where he presents weekly classes in Hasidic thought and philosophy, conducts a monthly farbrengen (Hasidic gathering), and spends Shabbat on campus several times a year. Although he is considered the \\"senior spokesman\\" of the Neo-Hasidic movement, he dislikes the title. Weinberger has been noted as \\"one of this generation's leading teachers of Chassidus\\". His teachings derive from a wide range of Hasidic sources, including the Baal Shem Tov, Ramchal, Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, the Baal HaTanya, Chabad, and Izbica, as well as from the Vilna Gaon, Rabbi Tzadok Hakohen, and Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, among others. He also teaches works that were previously unavailable to the English-speaking public, such as the works of the Bilvavi Mishkan Evneh. He has recorded over 3,500 lectures on Hasidic thought and philosophy. Works In the 1980s and 1990s Weinberger wrote articles on issues pertaining to Modern Orthodox practice and baalei teshuva (Orthodox Jewish returnees to the faith). He was a frequent contributor to Jewish Action, published by the Orthodox Union, and the Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society, published by the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School. In 1990 he authored the book Jewish Outreach: Halakhic Perspectives, on halakhic issues pertaining to Orthodox Jewish outreach. Since 2011, he has produced four volumes of English translation and commentary on the Hebrew sefer Oros HaTeshuva (The Lights of Repentance) by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, published under the title Song of Teshuva. In 2015 a collection of his Torah discourses at the annual hillula of the Piaseczna Rav at Congregation Aish Kodesh was published under the title Warmed by the Fire of the Aish Kodesh. Personal Weinberger wears full Hasidic levush (dress), including beard and peyos, Hasidic-style jacket and black hat on weekdays, and shtreimel and bekishe on Shabbat.

The lake is named after Chief Waramaug, who wintered in the area surrounding Lake Waramaug. Description Although natural in origin, the surface elevation of the lake has been raised by a small concrete and masonry dam. The surface area of the lake is approximately . The lake has a maximum depth of , an average depth of , and contains approximately of water. The lake is fed by Sucker Brook (Lake Waramaug Brook), numerous small streams, and groundwater that enters through the lake bottom. Drainage from Waramaug Lake flows southward into the East Aspetuck River. The bottom materials on steep side slopes of the lake consist primarily of gravel, cobbles, and boulders, whereas the flatter areas consist primarily of sand, mud, and organic muck. The watershed of the lake is 14.4 square miles (). Approximately 74 percent () of the watershed is forested. Wetlands and water bodies comprise approximately 10 percent () of the watershed, while the remaining 16 percent () of the area is low-density residential housing and commercial and agricultural land. The shoreline development of Lake Waramaug is moderate and includes houses, seasonal cottages, and boat houses, with few commercial establishments. Public access to the lake is available only within Lake Waramaug State Park, which is located at the northwestern end of the lake. Outside park boundaries, the shoreline is privately owned . The park can be reached by taking Route 45 north from Route 202 and turning west onto North Shore Road. An aquatic survey of Waramaug Lake was published in 1987. The survey found aquatic vegetation to be relatively sparse, with only localized growths of emergent and submergent species along the shorelines and shallows of the lake. Aquatic species observed include Robbins pondweed (Potamogeton robbinsii), coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum), white-water lily (Nymphaea odorata), narrow-leaved arrowhead (Sagittaria graminea), yellow-pond lily (Nuphar variegatum), spike rush (Eleocharis sp.), bushy pondweed (Najas flexilis), leafy pondweed (Potamogeton foliosus) and pondweed (Potamogeton gramineus). The fish species observed in Waramaug Lake include largemouth, smallmouth and calico bass; lake and rainbow trout; yellow and white perch; pickerel, alewives, sunfish, and bullheads. Town of Washington improvements In 2004, the Town of Washington entered into an agreement with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection to reconstruct and expand the town's boat launch at Lake Waramaug, and to permit 20 launchings per day by non-residents in exchange for the DEP agreeing not to construct a new boat launch at Lake Waramaug State Park. The agreement limits motor boat traffic on the lake, and requires inspection of all boats for invasive aquatic plant species prior to launching. Plans for the new boat launch were developed in 2006, and the new facility was opened in 2008. In 2010, the Town of Washington separately completed major reconstruction of the adjacent, hitherto forlorn town beach at Lake Waramaug, which may be used only by Washington residents and their guests. New parking areas were constructed, new fencing and landscaping were installed, and a new boathouse with a caretaker's apartment was constructed. In popular culture \\"Lake Waramaug\\" is a song by goth/synth rock band Deadsy. It appeared on the band's 2002 album Commencement.

South India, which advocates that Ayya Vaikundar is an incarnation of Narayana, based on its religious scripture Akilattirattu Ammanai. Some of its core believers advocate that Ayyavazhi is a religion in itself, whereas others believe that it is a sect within Hinduism. The path of Akilam is also viewed as a renaissance of Hinduism which regenerates and organises the ideas of all Hindu scriptures. But on the other hand it acts as an agent of reformation in the nineteenth century Tamil and Malayalam Society.  As a religion  The consideration of Ayyavazhi as a separate religion by itself is made based on the ideological deviation it takes from the existing so called 'Sanathana Dharma' , that is obviously exposed by Akilam centering Vaikundar. The supremacy of Vaikundar is highly portrayed since the 'formless absolute' or the 'supreme self' Ekam is that which came in the form of him which was ever first through the ages. And so the beliefs, ideology and philosophy of Ayyavazhi are viewed with the activities of Vaikundar as the epi-center, which in turn contrasts with the inclusionistic nature of the existing Sanathana. The philosophy of Ayyavazhi starts with the monism during creation and evolved as polytheism till the end of Dvapara Yuga, further evolved to henotheism till the incarnation of Vaikundar and then onwards turns panentheistic highlighting Vaikundar as the overall supreme, making it unique. The yuga-dharma for the Kali yuga is 'Preaching the Gospel of Vaikundar' , says Akilam, making it to move further from the mainstream Hinduism. Apart from this the list of Primary Avatars provided by Akilam is different from that of the Hindu scriptures. Also Vaikundar is considered supreme to all others in Akilam; Socialogically, Monotheism is advocated varrying extremely from the Hindu Polytheism. The 'Ultimate refuge to Almighty' - the worship form in Ayyavazhi which replaces the domination of ritual importance in Hindu form of worship, is advocated in Akilam as the best way to attain the personal liberation. Mass prayer is the main form of worship in Ayyavazhi unlike in Hinduism. On the other hand the rituals of Ayyavazhi is arranged in such a way that it symbolises 'worshipping or realising one-self' . Akilam also seems to follow the Solar calendar unlike in Vedic Hinduism. The most important thing that gives Ayyavazhi a separate identity is, rejecting all previous scriptures including Vedas, though it shares many ideas (that of Pre-Vaikundar era) from those scriptures. Apart from this they have separate Holy places, which are all related to the activities of Vaikundar, Holy texts, rituals, theology, etc. and those other to them are rejected by Akilam and so the worshippers.

As a Hindu sect  Though Ayyavazhi has a separate outlook as a religion outside Hinduism the basic beliefs are based on the ultimate Dharma which is the core of the present 'Sanathana Dharma' , gives an idea that Ayyavazhi is a sect inside Hinduism. The Akilam based mythology is closely related to that of the mainstream Hindu scriptures. The basic doctrine is that 'to realise the invisible' (the ultimate monistic power) in the midst of the visibles, which is similar to that of Hinduism where the aim of atman is 'to attain Dharma (the supreme knowledge) . Many rituals such as circumambulating temples and wearing symbols in the fore-head in Ayyavazhi resembles that of Hinduism with minimal variations. The theology, by all means make Vaikundar 'the Supreme' which makes it a unique sect than any others within Hinduism. Though Vaikundar is the incarnation of Ekam - the supreme, since Narayana plays a double role as father of Vaikundar and being within Vaikundar, the theology moves somehow in the path of Vaishnavism. Strengthening this, Akilam also says in some places, especially in the Akilam one as 'Athi Narayana' to be the supreme. But during the creation it says 'Sivam' to be the supreme and in some places (Thiruvasakam - 2) Ekam as the utmost power. The very same idea moves Ayyavazhi closer to several sects of Hinduism. While the other Hindu sects advocates the mythical manifestations as gods, Akilam refers Vaikundar, a mytho-historical figure as 'Ayya' (Father) of Mankind. All the prayer forms in Ayyavazhi scriptures are viewed referring this term as 'phrase of praise'. Apart from following the Solar calendar, Akilam also gives equal but not more importance to the Lunar, which is highly respected in Hindu scriptures. All festivals of Ayyavazhi other than Ayya Vaikunda Avataram is celebrated following the Hindu calendar.  As a Hindu renaissance  Based on the utmost philosophy of Akilam, Ayyavazhi is viewed also as a Hindu Renaissance. It constructs a typical and unique mythical-story line which includes enormous quantity of events from the Hindu mythology including Ramayana and Mahabharata which are independent to one another. Philosophically Akilam gives space for all - from the deep-rooted polytheism (in the Hindu society) to the supreme monism of an intellectual Hindu. It also deals with the Siva-dominant Saivite ideology, Vishnu-dominant Vaishnava, Shakti dominant Saktism, and Smartism where all the Siva, Brahma and Vishnu gains equal status, though with limited time spans. All scriptures of Hinduism including Vedas, Agamas, Upanishads, Purana, Shastras are referred to in Akilam, their core concepts are churned out on one hand and on the other all those above mentioned scriptures are rejected and the uniqueness of Akilam os portrayed. Almost all god-heads of Hinduism including the higher-forms such as Siva, Brahma, Ganesh, Muruga etc. and the lower folk deities such as Kali, Madan (Ayyanar) etc. are included with appropriate mythical power-relations. In Akilam all those high-sensible knowledge in the Hindu scriptures is made understandable for the common mass in the ordinary language (colloquial Tamil) being mixed up with an interlinked story line. It also says about the travel of Atman through yugas and its final stage in which it loses its individuality and become the supreme. It also says the evil and its further classifications which acts against the evolution of Atman and also the evolutions of living beings from one form to another again with the same storyline, which is not found n Hinduism. As a whole, Akilam gives the overall ideology, Philosophy, mythology, theology, etc. of the Hindu scriptures collectively in brief, maintaining their own basic patterns.  As a reform movement  Apart from all these Ayyavazhi also acts as an agent of reformation on the social and religious ground of the 19th century Tamil and Malayalam society, against the then feudal Travancore government. The activities of Vaikundar and its impact over the society is the first and the greatest among the other reformers and movements. It has heavy influence over the impact and success of the Upper cloth Agitation and the Temple entry Agitation which took place later in the Tamil society. Also Ayyavazhi forms the root cause for the origin of other reform movements such as Narayana Guru Movement and that of Ayyankali.

Early life Daif Al-Ghazal was born in Benghazi in 1976. His father is a descendant of the Al-Shahibat tribe, a prominent Eastern Libyan tribe, and his mother is from the Al-Hawara tribe which is equally well known. He studied at Garyounis University, where he received a History degree from the Literature department. In the 1980s, Daif Al-Ghazal joined the Movement of Revolutionary Committees (MRC). The MRC was set up by the government to propagate the ideologies of Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, as expressed in The Green Book. In the early 1990s Al- Ghazal joined the new Benghazi Mathaba. He advanced within the MRC hierarchy, and was appointed to the coveted post of Media and Culture Coordinator. He continued working as a journalist and was named chief editor of the Benghazis office of Al-Zahf Al-Akhdar (\\"The Green March\\" in Arabic). Opposition to the Libyan Government Differences between Al-Ghazal and the MRC began appearing in 2003. These differences were clearly articulated in his columns published in the newspaper, Al-Zahf Al-Akhdar. In 2004, he delivered a lecture on government corruption at the Green Book Research Center. His criticisms lead the Libyan government to fight him viciously, especially members of the MRC of Al-Berka in Benghazi. On February 27, 2005, Al-Ghazal told the online newspaper Libya al-Yaum (\\"Libya Today\\" - based in London) that he was the victim of oppression and undue process because of his articles, criticism and reports. Following this announcement, Al-Ghazal was summoned to the office of communication where he was interrogated. Despite claimed numerous threats, Al- Ghazal continued writing articles in 2004 and 2005, exposing these alleged threats in Internet newspapers published outside Libya. Murder On May 21, 2005, and according to Mohammed Abdul Malek London-based human rights organization Libya Watch, Daif Al-Ghazal was abducted by two armed individuals who announced that they were from internal security as he returned from visiting a friend and was accompanied another journalist named Mohamed Al- Marghani, near a farm located in the Huary region. On May 30, 2005, the Garyounis police informed Al-Ghazal's family that an unknown body beginning to decompose was found, which they requested them to identify. Daif Al-Ghazal was buried on June 3, 2005. The autopsy report, obtained by Libyan Human Rights Solidarity, referred to many signs of torture. Most of his fingers had been severed, and the body had multiple bruises and stab wounds. Al-Ghazal was killed from a bullet wound to the head.Opposition journalist Daif Al Ghazal tortured to death, Reporters Without Borders. June 6, 2005 The Libyan government remained quiet for fifteen days, from the time of his abduction, to the discovery of his body and subsequent burial. Libyan Justice Minister Ali Hasnaoui then officially announced that Al-Ghazal was found murdered, and further added that he was actually of Egyptian descent; this was abhorred by Al-Ghazal's family. Questions remain despite promises made by Justice Minister Hasnaoui to reveal the circumstances surrounding the murder, and the adoption of the case by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, head of the Gaddafi Institute for Development.

The Sakaguchi detachment is credited with the capture of Cilacap Regency port after a 400 km long march. The detachment was merged back into the 56th Division in April 1942. With the Pacific War becoming imminent, the 56th Division was fully mobilized in November 1941. Although initially the 56th division was slated as reinforcements for the Japanese invasion of Malaya, the rapid cessation of British resistance have resulted in division been attached to 25th Army and sent to Burma in March 1942, landing in Rangoon and participating in the Battle of Toungoo. The 56th Division linked with the 55th Division in Toungoo on 28 March 1942. Its reconnaissance elements forced the Chinese to evacuate the city opening the way to the east. Later the 56th Division flanked the allied line to the east, by advancing through the mountains to the Salween River in the Karenni States. The Division defeated the Chinese 6th Corps in the Karen Hills area battles of Mawchi on 13 April 1942, Bawlake, Bato, Taunggyi and Loikaw on 20 April 1940,World War II database: Invasion of Burma and forced their retreat eastward to Yunnan. Advancing north through the Shan States the 56th Division defeated elements of the Chinese 65th Corps to take the city of Lashio on the Burma Road. The fall of Lashio to the 56th Division on 29 April 1942 cut off much of the local Chinese Army from China and compelled the Allies to evacuate Burma. The Division advanced into Yunnan in pursuit of the Chinese but were halted at the Battle of Salween River by the Chinese 36th and 88th Divisions on 31 May 1942. From May 1942, the 56th Division performed mostly garrison duties on the Yunnan border. The 113th Infantry Regiment was mostly in Yunnan except for the 3rd Battalion in Longling County. The 148th Infantry Regiment was stationed in Tengchong. The heavy fighting resumed in January 1944 with the Battle of Lashio, as part of Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan campaign in 1944. During the campaign, the division's 114th Infantry Regiment, borrowed from the 18th Division, was credited with shattering Merrill's Marauders in the Siege of Myitkyina in May‚ÄìAugust 1944 and in delaying the 15:1 superior Chinese forces and inflicting heavy Chinese casualties during the Battle of Mount Song.

Schillaci is the 488th fugitive to be placed on the list. He was captured on June 5, 2008 in San Jos√© de Gracia, Michoac√°n, Mexico after almost nine years on the run. On December 22, 2009 Schillaci was sentenced to 20 to 50 years in prison. He is incarcerated in Northern New Hampshire Correctional Facility and will be eligible for parole in December 2039. Early life Schillaci was born in Oklahoma in 1971 and was given up for adoption as an infant. Most of his childhood, which has been described as \\"turbulent\\", was spent in Texas. During his first prison term, Schillaci told officials he had been abused by a relative as a child. Prior to his arrest in 1989 he frequented the Neartown area of Houston. At the age of 17, Schillaci practiced transvestism. Schillaci has educational background in behavioral sciences, computer science, drafting, philosophy, religion and politics. He has also been described as computer savvy, an accomplished pianist, and an adequate guitarist. He attended, but did not graduate from Clements High School in Sugar Land, Texas.Clements Yearbook 1988, Page 182 Crimes in 1989 In 1989, then 17-year-old Schillaci and a 20-year-old man were accused of sexually abusing two 11-year-old twin brothers. Schillaci and his friend befriended the brothers, who lived in an apartment with their single mother. They took the boys out for dinner and to screenings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show several times. Later, they invited the boys to Schillaci's home, showed them a film of child pornography, then videotaped the boys engaging in sexual acts with each other. After filming them, Schillaci engaged in sexual acts with both of the boys. He was arrested days later on January 29, 1989, when he tried to sell the video to an adult bookstore for $500. He pleaded guilty to two counts of sex performed by a child and four counts of aggravated sexual assault and was convicted on April 26, 1990 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Incarceration in Texas Schillaci, who was already fluent in Spanish, studied French and German in prison. He completed a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees in humanities and literature from the University of Houston. Schillaci also wrote poetry and submitted his poems to a now-defunct New Hampshire literary magazine called The Fishwrapper, a quasi-underground student-run publication in University of New Hampshire. Schillaci won first prize for poetry with his poem Americans in PEN American Center's prisoner writing contest in 1998. A Deerfield, New Hampshire family had a connection with The Fishwrapper and they started correspondence with Schillaci by letters. They developed a pen pal relationship, which lasted throughout his incarceration, over seven years. Schillaci's mug shot taken after his release. He told the family that he was rehabilitated and about his desire for a new beginning. He wrote eloquently about how he was studying in prison and referred to crimes he had committed as \\"mistakes of his youth\\". The family believed that Schillaci was sincere and wanted to give him a place to stay after his release. Another reason for the family's trust was that Schillaci had gained acceptance to a Ph.D. program in Tufts University. Schillaci has friends and family in Houston and Dallas, but did not receive any visitors in prison. Release and move to New Hampshire After Schillaci was released from Rosharon prison on July 30, 1999, he registered as a sex offender and moved into the Deerfield family's home in early August to start a new life in New Hampshire. Schillaci was employed at Ted Herbert's Music Mart and Art Center in Manchester. He was a salesman at the store where hundreds of children took music lessons. He also worked as a computer operator. He was studying at nearby college and he later enrolled to Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, where he studied philosophy as a non-degree student in a graduate special student program for six weeks, until he fled sex crime charges. Sex crime charges In late October 1999, when Schillaci was returning from Tufts University, the couple's five-year-old son informed his parents that they had \\"a secret\\": Schillaci had sexually abused him during piano lessons. The family alerted authorities and police served Schillaci with a restraining order. Schillaci reported to work the next day and in the afternoon he fled and left his computer and car near a bus station. He gave his car keys to a coworker and told him to get rid of his truck and its contents. After speaking with the boy, officials were able to determine that Schillaci had shown him child pornography and sexually abused him between three and seven times during his seven-week period in Deerfield. As a result, Schillaci was indicted on sexual assault charges on November 4, 1999 and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest a month later for failing to appear in court. The Boston field office of the FBI also issued a warrant for his arrest. In September 2000, Schillaci was also charged with 23 counts of possession of child pornography, when approximately 300 images of child pornography were found on the family's computer he used. According to authorities, those images contained \\"every type of sexual act imaginable\\". Fugitive This image of Schillaci in 1999 was used in his FBI wanted poster. Schillaci was seen boarding a Greyhound Lines bus and heading for California. Schillaci crossed the Mexico ‚Äì United States border illegally and remained in Mexico until he was captured and deported, although he traveled within the country. Schillaci was seen in Rosarito, Baja California, Mexico in March 2000. Before U.S. Marshals could arrive, Schillaci had fled, leaving behind allegations of improper sexual relationships with children in the town. It was believed he was working in a pediatrician's office in 2000. At the time, Schillaci had used several aliases including Jon Willis, Christopher Keegan and Cody Keegan. Schillaci gained an online following in the underground pedophile community, and was described as a kingpin in the world of child pornography. His networks helped him to avoid capture twice and gave financial support by donating money to his PayPal account. Using an alias Dylan Thomas (after the Welsh poet), he operated as a DJ for an Internet radio show, The Dylan Thomas Show and became a webmaster of BoyChat in 2003. BoyChat is an internet forum for \\"boylovers\\", people who discuss their sexual attraction to young boys. Schillaci was living in Guadalajara, Jalisco from approximately February 2003 until September 2006 under the alias Dylan Natchitoches Pierce. Erick Anderson Lowell was one of his aliases as well. In 2004, Gregory Alec Phillips, a convicted sex offender from Tennessee, flew from Thailand to Mexico to meet a man he knew as Dylan Thomas. Phillips lived with him for approximately 30 days. Although Phillips later claimed he never witnessed any sexual interactions, he stated that \\"Thomas\\" engaged in sex with young boys because \\"there were little boys in and out of there all the time\\". After his return to the United States, \\"Thomas\\" had asked Phillips to check on the status of \\"Thomas'\\" own outstanding warrants. In 2005, as a part of a story filmed during the People v. Jackson trial, Dylan Thomas, a spokesman for the pedophile community, was interviewed by NBC News correspondent Josh Mankiewicz on a Mexican beach. Producers had agreed not to reveal his face or name. The interview never aired. Schillaci was profiled on the television program America's Most Wanted and he was added to the list of FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives on September 7, 2007. He replaced another sexual predator, Richard Goldberg, who was captured on May 12, 2007. Schillaci is the first fugitive from New Hampshire to have been added to the list. The FBI offered a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to Schillaci's capture and considered Schillaci extremely dangerous. Investigation and capture In 2007, Schillaci's activities under alias Dylan Thomas caught the attention of volunteers on Wikisposure, now Evil Unveiled, a project of Perverted-Justice, which builds databases on pedophilia activists. who began to investigate and monitor \\"Thomas'\\" activities on the Internet. Members of Wikisposure found a profile Thomas had posted on his website in 2003. In it, he discussed playing the piano to attract children's interest. A path of similar profiles was discovered across the Internet. Each profile had a different username or alias but listed something in common. A profile of Christopher D. Ahrens was discovered on an engineering website that had a small photograph attached to it. A person in the photograph looked exactly like Jon Schillaci. Evidence indicated that online profiles of Dylan Thomas, Christopher Ahrens, among others, were all created by Schillaci. After Wikisposure gave the information to the FBI, authorities were able to track down the location of the computer being used by Schillaci. The FBI wouldn't comment on Wikisposure's role, citing its policy of not commenting on who provides information. After being a fugitive for eight years, Schillaci was arrested in the town of San Jos√© de Gracia, Michoac√°n on June 5, 2008 without incident. When approached by the FBI and Mexican authorities, he confirmed his identity. He was living in what was described as an unkempt shack. Schillaci did not face any child pornography charges in Mexico, although Mexican authorities could still charge him. Schillaci was briefly detained by Mexico and extradited back to United States the next day. Schillaci was transported to Morelia, Mexico where he boarded Mexicana Airlines to the United States. Schillaci and his FBI escort Laura Hanlon landed at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. He was then transferred to an FBI aircraft and flown to Pease International Airport in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He was then brought to the Rockingham County Courthouse for arraignment on his charges. Trial and incarceration In county court, Judge Tina Nadeau ordered Schillaci held without bail and entered not-guilty pleas for him until he got a lawyer. He requested a public defender. Schillaci awaited his trial in Rockingham County Jail and faced a life sentence because of his prior convictions. His trial was scheduled for early 2010. Schillaci decided to plead guilty after prosecutors had informed a judge they would seek an enhanced sentence against Schillaci that could keep him in prison for the rest of his life. On December 22, 2009, Jon Schillaci was sentenced to 20 to 50 years in state prison after pleading guilty to one count of aggravated felonious sexual assault and 23 counts of possession of child pornography. According to prosecutors, they agreed to make a plea agreement because Schillaci's victim (now aged 15) was unwilling to testify and wanted to maintain his anonymity. After Schillaci was apprehended, his computer, which had reams of child pornography on its hard drive, led the FBI into an expansive probe of seeking child victims in the United States. As a part of his plea bargain, Schillaci cooperated with federal authorities by offering to give a name of one person. The information has led to federal indictment of the person in question and rescue of one sexually abused child. Schillaci was incarcerated in New Hampshire State Prison for Men, but he was transferred to Northern New Hampshire Correctional Facility. He will be eligible for parole in December 2039.

Rowohlt Verlag) Lust is a novel by Austrian author Elfriede Jelinek. Originally published in German in 1989, it was translated into English in 1992 by Michael Hulse. Plot Lust tells the story of Hermann, a manager of a paper mill, and his wife, Gerti, whom he abuses sexually on a daily basis. They have a son together. Taken to drink, Gerti wanders into a nearby ski resort, where she has a brute encounter with Michael, a self-centered student and hopeful politician. Michael discards her for younger women he seduces regularly. Gerti takes these actions, however, for love and leaves to have her hair done. Later, she returns to find Michael skiing. He abuses her physically in front of a crowd of younger people. Disappointed and disillusioned, Gerti returns home and drowns her son in a nearby stream. Critical response The novel is, like all of Jelinek's novels, lyrical and musical in its structure and features sexual and physical violence. Lust attracted a great deal of controversy upon publication, with many reviewers arguing that the novel is pornography. Critics have noted that \\"only first names are used to signify the characters. The deletion of the last name of the factory owner and husband Hermann, and his wife and sexual object, Gerti, demonstrates the interchangeability of the characters.\\" The book has been described as a literary culmination of Jelinek's \\"aesthetics of the obscene.\\" An excerpt from Lust, accompanied by a short essay, was published in a pro-pornography collection edited by Claudia Gehrke called Frauen & Pornografie (Women & Pornography) in 1988; that same year, Jelinek also contributed to the Emma campaign for an anti-pornography law that would reverse the 1975 reform of criminal law, which liberalized paragraph 184 and \\"effectively legalized pornography in Germany.\\" Critics have argued that these actions are not \\"so much indicative of a theoretical indecisiveness on her part as it is of an implicit diacritical principle or norm on the basis of which she seeks to separate a male, exploitative pornography from its female reinterpretation.\\" Jelinek stated that she set out to write an \\"erotic, indeed pornographic, novel from a woman's point of view,\\" but found it impossible because the \\"brutalized language used to describe sex was a purely male language of exploitation.\\" References Category:1989 novels Category:Novels by Elfriede Jelinek Category:Rowohlt Verlag books ","title":"Lust (Jelinek novel)"},{"id":"13145961","text":"Fore () is a village, next to the old Benedictine Abbey ruin of Fore Abbey, situated to the north of Lough Lene in County Westmeath, in Ireland. The village, (sister parish of nearby St. Mary's Collinstown) is situated within a valley between two hills: the Hill of Ben, the Hill of Houndslow, and the Ankerland rise area. There can be found the ruins of a Christian monastery, which had been populated at one time by French Benedictine monks from √âvreux, Normandy. Fore is the anglicised version of the Irish name that signifies ‚Äúthe town of the water-springs‚Äù and was given to the area after Saint Feichin‚Äôs spring or well, which is next to the old church a short distance from where the ruined monastery still stands. It was St. Feichin who founded the ancient Fore Abbey around 630. By 665 (the time of the yellow plague) there were 300 monks living in the community. Another important aspect of Fore is the Fore Crosses one of which is in the village of Fore. There are 18 crosses; some crosses are plain (most likely to wind and rain erosion) whilst others still remain carved. These are spread out over 7 miles on roadways and in fields and bore witness to religious persecution during penal times. The Monk Gerald of Wales related the following legend of F√©ch√≠n: \\" Chapter LII (Of the mill which no women enter) :\\"There is a mill at Foure, in Meath, which St. Fechin made most miraculously with his own hands, in the side of a certain rock. No women are allowed to enter either this mill or the church of the saint; and the mill is held in as much reverence by the natives as any of the churches dedicated to the saint. It happened that when Hugh de Lacy was leading his troops through this place, an archer dragged a girl into the mill and there violated her.

This is sometimes a feature of a Rich Internet application (RIA). Software architecture Occasionally connected computing is a software architecture based on the idea that an end user should be able to continue working with an internet application even when temporarily disconnected or when a wireless connection fails or is otherwise unavailable. OCC has been seen as one aspect of 'pervasive computing'. In the past, audio and visual telephony no longer functioned when a connection was lost. In an OCC architecture, tasks continue and update a central data store when a connection is restored. Client-side persistent data (CSPD), while not permanent data as in a central data store, are a common implementation of an OCC framework on non-handheld devices such as personal and laptop computers. As the local data store on PDAs commonly exceeds several Gigabytes, OCC becomes more viable for handheld devices. OCC frameworks and implementations In the case of the Curl language an alternate URI scheme is used to identify a resource which is to be used for OCC. Where a normal HTTP URL might be {url \\"http://www.your-office.com/your-site.php\\" } an OCC URI could be {url \\"curl://occ/reconnect-as-needed\\" } Such a URI redirects to the web when connected and to the local store when disconnected. The Smalltalk language is a special case because of the ability to save the bytecode image at run time. The possibilities using the REBOL 2.x runtime environment lie somewhere between Smalltalk and Curl 5.0 but may be extended with the release of REBOL 3.0 which is projected for late 2008 (a public alpha began in Jan 2008.)

After two seasons, including 25 games in the top-level American Association, he entered the United States Army. Assigned to the First Army's 49th Combat Engineers, he participated in Operation Torch, Operation Overlord, Operation Cobra and the Battle of the Bulge. According to Gary Bedingfield's Baseball in Wartime, Martin was badly wounded in action at least twice: \\"At the Battle of the Bulge, he suffered a bullet wound to the thigh and nearly lost a leg after gangrene set in. It took more than 150 shots of penicillin to spare him from an amputation.\\"Baseball in Wartime.com However, Martin was able to return to baseball in 1946, the first full peacetime season. Now a member of the Brooklyn farm system, he had his first MLB trial with the pennant-bound 1949 Dodgers, appearing in ten games, including four starts. After spending 1950 back in the minor leagues, he was selected by the Philadelphia Athletics in the Rule 5 draft and had a sparkling campaign, winning 11 of 15 decisions (.733) for a sixth-place team that played at only a .455 pace over the entire season.

He also inspired the Queen Mother's interest in National Hunt racing. Early life Mildmay was the son of Francis Bingham Mildmay, 1st Baron Mildmay of Flete and his wife Alice Grenfell.L. G.

He then went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the University Pitt Club. He fought in World War II, as an officer in the Welsh Guards, rising to the rank of Captain. He succeeded to the title of 2nd Baron Mildmay of Flete on 8 February 1947. Steeplechasing \\"Nitty\\" Mildmay, a gaunt, stoop-shouldered six-footer, was a well-known and popular amateur steeplechaser. He rode in the Grand National before and after the war, becoming known as a persistent 'trier', despite several episodes of bad luck. In 1936, riding the 100-1 Davy Jones, he was leading at the 2nd to last fence when a buckle on the reins broke and the horse ran out. In 1947, he fell at Folkestone and injured his neck, which gave rise to a number of disabling attacks of cramp. In the 1948 Grand National he finished third on his favourite horse Cromwell, after an attack of the cramp meant he was just a passenger. During his career, he rode 197 winners from 1,037 rides under National Hunt Rules. He highest was 38 winners in 1949/50 season. He was the Leading Amateur 4 times and shared the title in 1937/38.Anthony Mildmay by Roger Mortimer published by MacGibbon & Kee privately on behalf of his family He rode eight winners at Cheltenham, including three at The Festival.Richard Stone Reeves Crown Jewels of Thoroughbred Racing Blood-Horse Publications, 1997 His final winner was on his own good hunter chaser Prince Brownie at the now defunct Kent racecourse of Wye on Monday 8 May 1950. His final ride was in the following Handicap Hurdle when he was placed 5th riding Peter Cazalet's Lady Beware \\"making up a lot of late ground\\".The Queen Mother's Horses Ivor Herbert page 25 However, Mildmay's most notable legacy was probably in kindling an interest in jump-racing in her Majesty the Queen Mother. At a dinner in Windsor Castle in 1949, Mildmay sat next to the then Queen Elizabeth and persuaded her that he should buy her a horse, to share with her daughter, then Princess Elizabeth.Graham Rock \\"The racing royal whose beloved horses gave her huge happiness \\" in The Observer Sunday 31 March 2002 Guardian Unlimited full text (accessed 15 January 2008). Mildmay's trainer Peter Cazalet selected Monaveen for them. Monaveen won his first race for them, at Fontwell Park, finished second in the Grand Sefton Chase at Aintree, and then took the prestigious Queen Elizabeth Chase at Hurst Park. The result was a passion for the sport that lasted the Queen Mother for the rest of her life. Early death In 1950, Mildmay suffered an attack of cramp while swimming off the south Devon coast. He drowned at the age of 41. He was unmarried and the title became extinct.See The Times, 7 June 1950 page 6, column D ‚Äì \\"Lord Mildmay's body recovered: Found in Falmouth Bay\\". Commemoration Mildmay left his horses to his old racing and wartime colleague Peter Cazalet. Among them was Manicou, which became the Queen Mother's second steeplechaser. The Times called him \\"The Last of the Corinthians\\" and wrote: \\"there never was a harder rider, a better loser or a more popular winner: and though he has always valued the race more than the victory and the victory more than the prize, he would not perhaps have disdained the reward he has won - which is a kind of immortality among the English\\".Encyclopaedia of Steeplechasing compiled by Patricia Smyly 1979 He was commemorated in several events initiated by his friends. These include: the Mildmay of Flete Handicap Chase at Cheltenham Racecourse, the Mildmay Stakes at Newton Abbot Racecourse, and the Anthony Mildmay, Peter Cazalet Memorial Chase at Sandown Park Racecourse.These races have all now changed their names. The Grade 2 Mildmay Novices 'Chase is run at Aintree over the Mildmay Course on the 2nd day of the Grand National Meeting. He was commemorated in The Mildmay Course at Aintree Racecourse, which opened in memory of him, in 1953. . The Mildmay course at Aintree was designed by Lord Mildmay and Sir John Crocker Bulteel to introduce novice horses to Aintree. The original layout of the track had mini National fences designed to introduce horses to the type of fences seen on the Grand National Course itself. However they were never all that popular with trainers and fields over the course tended to be small. At the time Aintree staged NH only meetings in December and January. After the mid 1960s when only the National meeting took place at Aintree the Mildmay course was only used once a year for a 2 mile Novices 'Chase called the Mildmay Novices 'Chase. A 2m Novices 'Chase is still run at Aintree on Grand National Day now a Grade 1 race called the Maghull Novices 'Chase. The mini National fences were replaced by conventional birch Steeplechase fences in 1975 the year in which flat racing ceased at Aintree. In 1990 the layout of the Mildmay Course was changed. P.G. Wodehouse cited Mildmay as \\"very much the type\\" of the character of Bertie Wooster,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re9QXetFipM&t; but as the first Bertie Wooster stories appeared in 1916, when Mildmay was only seven, he cannot have been the inspiration as is sometimes claimed.

The villages of Thornhill and Port of Menteith lie to the north with the villages of Kippen and Buchlyvie lying to the south. The moss is a National Nature Reserve, managed by NatureScot. Formed on the Carse of Stirling over 8000 years ago, it is an internationally important habitat currently undergoing active restoration. The eastern part of Flanders Moss is the largest raised bog in Europe to remain in a predominantly near-natural state. As well as being an important habitat for wildlife, Flanders Moss also plays a key role for carbon sequestration acting as a carbon sink.The Story of Flanders Moss National Nature Reserve. p. 29. Flora and fauna thumb The bog is composed of an underlayer of sphagnum mosses, on top of which grows heather, cross-leaved heath and cotton-grass.The Story of Flanders Moss National Nature Reserve. p. 9. Core samples from the peat show that there were very few trees on the bog for most of its life, however trees and scrub have spread over around 200 ha: these are predominantly birch, although Scots pine and the non-native rhododendron can also be found.The Story of Flanders Moss National Nature Reserve. p. 10. The moss supports many plant species that are specialised to boggy conditions, including round-leaved sundew, cranberry, bog asphodel, white beak-sedge, and the nationally scarce bog rosemary.The Story of Flanders Moss National Nature Reserve. p. 12. The bog is home to many species of invertebrates, especially moths: 215 species of moth have been recorded here, including rare species such as Lampronia fuscatella and the Rannoch brindled beauty. Many of the invertebrate are associated with the trees and scrub on the bog. Bird species known to breed at Flanders Moss include snipe, curlew and stonechat on the open parts of the moss, with tree pipit, cuckoo and wood warbler preferring the wooded areas. Winter visitors include whooper swans, and greylag and pink-footed geese. Raptors such as hen harriers, short-eared owls and ospreys can also be seen.The Story of Flanders Moss National Nature Reserve. p. 13 Red and roe deer are known to visit the reserve, and otters make use the network of ditches to pass through the area. Flanders Moss is also home to many species of both reptiles and amphibians. Reptile species include adders, common lizards, and slow worm.The Story of Flanders Moss National Nature Reserve. p. 14. History The enclosure at Ballangrew on the western edge of the moss may have served as a hunting lodge during the mediaeval period. During the 18th and early 19th centuries objects dating from the Bronze Age to the Roman period were found in the vicinity of Ballangrew, including a Bronze Age cauldron made of beaten bronze. There are a number of other archaeological sites surrounding the moss, many of which consist of ditches, peat banks and dams used to drain the land to improve it for agriculture. During the 18th century, drainage of the land was encouraged by the lawyer, historian and improver Henry Home, Lord Kames, but a substantial portion survived this development at two sites - West Flanders Moss and East Flanders Moss. The Strathendrick and Aberfoyle Railway was built through West Flanders Moss. Opening in 1880, the line ran between the villages of Buchlyvie and Gartmore. In the 1970s, the rest of West Flanders Moss was drained and planted with a commercial forest by the Forestry Commission, though much of the plantation is now being removed and the moss restored to its natural state. Management Flanders Moss is a site of special scientific interest, and was designated as part of a special area of conservation on 17 March 2005: the Flanders Mosses SAC includes four other raised bogs in the Carse of Stirling: Collymoon Moss, Killorn Moss, Offerance Moss and Shirgarton Moss.The Story of Flanders Moss National Nature Reserve. p. 6. Scottish Natural Heritage purchased rights on the site in 1995. The site is designated a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. NatureScot owns of the reserve, and manage the remaining area via agreements or leases with the other 4 private landowners. NatureScot is seeking to reverse the drying effect of historical ditch construction, peat removal and tree growth. Ditches are being dammed, with the aim of raising the level of the water table to as close to the surface as possible. They agency is also removing trees and non-native rhododendron, focusing on maintaining open areas of free of trees, whilst leaving more mature areas of native woodland intact. Sheep are grazed on the reserve to prevent new trees becoming established.The Story of Flanders Moss National Nature Reserve. pp. 22-25. Visitors thumb The reserve is now visited by around 8000 people each year. There is an access track leading to a car park on the eastern side of the site; here there is a viewing tower and a short (900 m) waymarked trail.The Story of Flanders Moss National Nature Reserve. p. 26. NatureScot plan to look providing new paths on and around Flanders Moss, aiming to provide longer routes, access to the west side of the moss, and potentially a link to the village of Thornhill.

Built in 1793, it was the home of Lemuel Haynes (1753-1833), the first African-American clergyman ordained in North America, from 1822 to 1833. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975. and The house was purchased from Charles Halderman as a private residence in 2009 by Bo Young and William J. Foote and is not normally open to the public. Description and history The Lemuel Haynes House is located in the rural village of South Granville, on the south side of Washington County Route 27 a short distance east of its junction with New York State Route 149. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It is oriented with its front facade facing east, perpendicular to the street. The main facade is five bays wide, with closely set pairs of sash windows on either side of the central entrance. The house is not architecturally distinguished, but does retain some period features, including wide floor boards and a large kitchen fireplace with builtin oven. The house was built in 1793. From 1822 until his death in 1833, the house was home to Lemuel Haynes. Born to a white woman and man of African descent, Haynes spent his early years in indentured servitude, but was educated by his master and introduced to the Congregational church. He served in the local (Granville, Massachusetts) militia during the American Revolutionary War, after his indenture ended, and was formally ordained as a Congregationalist minister in 1780. His service as minister to the Middle Granville church marks the first known instance of an African-American preacher leading a predominantly white congregation. Haynes spent many years leading a church in Rutland, Vermont, before ending his long career in Granville, New York.

Early Mormon leaders These leaders were the first three Presidents of the Church of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church): *Joseph Smith (1805‚Äì44) *Brigham Young (1847‚Äì77) *John Taylor (1877‚Äì87) Some Mormon fundamentalists also regard the next three LDS Church presidents as leaders: *Wilford Woodruff (1887‚Äì1898) *Lorenzo Snow (1898‚Äì1901) *Joseph F. Smith (1901‚Äì1918) Major Mormon fundamentalist groups When the LDS Church began excommunicating members who practiced polygamy after the Second Manifesto, Mormon fundamentalists began breaking away from the LDS Church. At first, there was one main Mormon fundamentalist group, the Council of Friends, also known as the \\"Woolley group\\" and the \\"Priesthood Council\\". The Council of Friends was centered in Salt Lake City and the Short Creek Community, later called Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah. The Council of Friends would ultimately split into four Mormon fundamentalist sects, the Latter Day Church of Christ (1935) located in Salt Lake City, Utah; the Apostolic United Brethren (1954), located in Bluffdale, Utah; the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (1954), located in Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah; and Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times, located in Chihuahua, Mexico.

However, after the death of Joseph the status of this sect is unknown. * Alex Joseph (1977‚Äì98) * Current leadership unknown (1998‚Äì) School of the Prophets The School of the Prophets has its headquarters in the Salem, Utah area. In 1968 Robert C. Crossfield published the Book of Onias, which contained revelations he claimed to have received since 1961. These revelations chastised LDS Church leaders for their abandonment of the celestial laws. Crossfield was excommunicated in 1972. The continuing revelations were later published as the Second Book of Commandments. In 1982 Crossfield formally established the School of the Prophets, overseen by a president and six counselors and headquartered in Salem, Utah. Ron and Dan Lafferty served in March 1984 as counselors in a local school of the prophets for the Provo, Utah, area. Four months after being removed from the school for refusing to renounce their revelation calling for the killing of certain individuals, the Laffertys murdered their brother Allen's wife and infant daughter. *Robert C.

Today, after-school programs do much more. There is a focus on helping students with school work but can be beneficial to students in other ways. An after-school program, today, will not limit its focus on academics but with a holistic sense of helping the student population. An after-school activity is any organized program that youth or adult learner voluntary can participate in outside of the traditional school day. Some programs are run by a primary or secondary school, while others are run by externally funded non-profit or commercial organizations. After-school youth programs can occur inside a school building or elsewhere in the community, for instance at a community center, church, library, or park. After-school activities are a cornerstone of concerted cultivation, which is a style of parenting that emphasizes children gaining leadership experience and social skills through participating in organized activities. Such children are believed by proponents to be more successful in later life, while others consider too many activities to indicate overparenting. While some research has shown that structured after-school programs can lead to better test scores, improved homework completion, and higher grades, further research has questioned the effectiveness of after-school programs at improving youth outcomes such as externalizing behavior and school attendance. Additionally, certain activities or programs have made strides in closing the achievement gap, or the gap in academic performance between white students and students of color as measured by standardized tests. Though the existence of after-school activities is relatively universal, different countries implement after-school activities differently, causing after-school activities to vary on a global scale.  Structure and organization   Typical activities  Kumon Center with students studying. There are myriad organized after-school activities, for children, youth and adult learners. They can focus on a variety of activities or issues, such as: * Reading, including book discussion club * Sports, including soccer, baseball, scooter racing, hockey, swimming * Performing arts, including dance, drama, ballet, choir, and band * Creative arts, including painting, drawing, crafts * Gifted/remedial education, including Kumon for literacy, mathematics, etc. * Test preparation, including Kaplan, Princeton Review, and Sylvan Learning among others. * Outdoor education, including Scouting, Girl Guides, Boys' Brigade, Camp Fire, 4-H, cadets * Financial literacy, including Jump$tart, Junior Achievement, and others. * Extracurricular activities in schools, including DECA, Future Business Leaders of America, and Fellowship of Christian Athletes * Community outreach, including After-School All-Stars and Boys and Girls Club of America  Management  Many elementary, middle and high schools host after-school activities. Some after-school activities are provided by community centres and teen centers which are free of charge, while others are provided by for-profit businesses which charge for membership. The organization and management of after-school activities often varies from country to country and depending on cultural background.  Case countries   India  A number of players have started providing after-school support services, but the number is still very small considering India's large population and the importance of education to the Indian middle class and others. More players should be entering the market to provide quality support, which the normal schools with larger class sizes and traditional teaching techniques don't provide. From the existing set of after-school study providers the ones most sought after are the ones with individualized learning modules that complement the K-12 school syllabus. Way2Success Learning Systems is the first for-profit provider in India of academically oriented individualized after-school programs that complement the school syllabus. They operate in the New Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon and Faridabad areas. NutSpace Edtech Pvt. Ltd. uses its proprietary Inventive Thinking Methodology to build 21st Century Skills in Children. It helps children develop leadership qualities, enhance skills like: communication, critical thinking, creativity and collaboration. They currently operate from Kanpur and Lucknow.  Taiwan  Many after-school programs in Taiwan surround academic enrichment and test preparation. Scholars Chen and Lu researched the impact of academic after-school activities amongst secondary school students in Taiwan, and their 2009 study showed that after-school academic enrichment programs and private cram schools in Taiwan increase students‚Äô educational achievement but have a negative effect on students‚Äô psychological well-being.  United Arab Emirates  In the United Arab Emirates, Afterschool.ae is an innovative online marketplace platform that allows parents to find, plan and book children's activities, and helps kids' activity providers to get found online.  United Kingdom  After-school activities in Britain are typically organised commercially and paid for by parents. Many children attend several a week, and occasionally even more than one per day. Similar activities also occur at weekends. There is typically less focus on the managed \\"enrichment\\" than in the US, beyond the basic choice of activity; for example football (soccer) is physically active and develops teamwork.  United States  After school programs are very common today in the United States. The 40 largest national youth organizations today have a total membership of about 40 million youths. The Boys & Girls Clubs of America focus mainly on positive youth development. Their staff provides information, guidance, and emotional support regarding a wide range of issues that youths face in often high-risk neighborhoods. There are national after-school programs in place as well as national advocates for access to after-school programs, like Afterschool Alliance, but many after-school programs in the United States operate at the state level. The oldest after school program in the country, the Knickerbocker Greys, was established in 1881 and is located in New York City. In Virginia, Beans and Rice Organization is a community economic development organization that builds assets and develops capacities in low and moderate income families through economic and educational programs. Beans and Rice offers afterschool programs in Pulaski and Radford, Virginia. Volunteers serve as mentors, tutors, and teachers. All volunteers receive training and close supervision from both Beans and Rice staff and experienced volunteers. Elementary students who participate in the Beans and Rice after school programs are given a snack, tutoring, active play opportunities, and positive role models.Beans & Rice home page In Texas, a statewide program exists for creating after-school programs: Texas Afterschool Centers on Education, or Texas ACE. Texas ACE is a part of the Texas Education Agency, funded by the U.S. Department of Education's 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, which sponsors afterschool enrichment programs at under- resourced schools in the U.S. In California, after-school programming at the secondary level is funded primarily with 21st Century High School ASSETS (After School Safety and Enrichment for Teens) program grants. These grants stipulate programs must include academic, enrichment, and health and nutrition components. The after-school programs at California's elementary schools are predominantly funded with ASES (After-School Education & Safety) Program grants mandated when voters statewide approved California's Proposition 49 (2002). These grants provide for much of what the ASSETS grants provide at the secondary level, though there is an added family literacy component. Throughout Southern California, non-profit providers work in partnership with school districts to provide after-school programs for k-12 students. Typically school districts apply for the grants to fund the local after-school programs. Then districts either elect to manage those program internally or outsource management to a Community-based organization (CBO), Non-governmental organization (NGO) or other local non-profit provider. Beyond the Bell is a district run and managed after-school program offered to students in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). THINK Together, California's largest non-profit provider, contracts with approximately 20 Southern California school district partners to run and manage academically oriented after-school programs at approximately 200 school sites located across Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.  Benefits of after-school activities   Positive use of time  Some working parents wish for their children to be more supervised during after-school hours, which Mahoney, Larson, and Eccles's 2005 study discovered to be a leading reason for student enrollment in structured after-school programs. Likewise, in a 2010 article, scholars Wu and Van Egeren found that some parents enroll their students in after-school programs in order to give them a supervised, safe place to spend time. Many after-school activities take place in the afternoons of school days, on the weekends, or during the summer, thereby helping working parents with childcare. While some after-school programs serve as a day-care facility for young children, other programs specifically target adolescents in middle and high schools‚Äîproviding opportunities for children of all ages. Some proponents of these programs argue that if left unsupervised, children and adolescents may fall into undesirable activities such as sexual promiscuity, substance abuse, or gang-affiliated activity.After-school fact sheet Since adolescents are old enough to be left unsupervised, they have a higher risk of engaging in criminal behavior than young children do, which may increase the perceived need for constructive after-school programs, as Cook, Godfredson, and Na argue in their 2010 article in the journal Crime and Justice. In the United States, interest in utilizing after-school programs for delinquency-prevention increased dramatically after research found that juvenile arrest rates peak between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. on school days. By keeping students involved in school related activities, it lessens the chance for them to get involved in criminal activity or abuse drugs and alcohol. Involvement with after-school programs has led to students obtaining of more negative view on drugs. A study of positive outcomes from after-school program involvement shows that there are lower uses of drugs such as \\"alcohol, marijuana, and other drug use\\" (Kraemer, et al. 2007) after being involved with an after-school program.  Academic growth  Students participating in an after-school program through Columbia College Chicago at Sullivan High School in Chicago, Illinois in May 2012. Studies show that afterschool programs are beneficial for both children and adolescents. A 1994 long-term study by Posner and Vandell found that children in structured, academic afterschool programs had increased academic achievement when compared to their peers. Researchers chose a pool of children who had taken part in some sort of after-school program and another pool of children who did not take part in a formal after-school program as a control group. They gave assessments to the children, their parents, and their teachers in order to determine the children's levels of academic achievement, and the results showed that students who had taken part in a structured after- school program were more likely to have better grades and to perform higher in math and reading tests than those who had not taken part in an after-school program. Similarly, a 2010 study by Durlak, Weissberg, and Pachan showed that both children and adolescents experienced significant academic gains by taking part in afterschool programs. Several other studies (e.g., Morrison, Storino, Robertson, Weissglass, & Dondero, 2000; Tucker et al., 1995) have found that after-school academic tutoring or homework assistance may not result in an improvement in academic performance, but, rather, prevent a decline in performance that is evidenced by many at-risk youth. Morrison et al. (2000) studied 350 at-risk students, half of whom participated in an after-school program that provided homework assistance, tutoring, and cultural enrichment activities. They found after 1 year that students in the program maintained their initial levels of school bonding and teacher ratings of student behavior, while a matched cohort of students who did not participate in the program showed decreases on these measures over the same period of time. Tucker et al. (1995) evaluated an afterschool tutoring program serving low- income African American students. After 2 years, participants did not show significant increases in grades, but students who were not in the program showed a significant grade decrease. Together, these studies indicate that after-school academic support may play a protective role by helping to prevent a loss of school engagement even if it doesn't result in higher levels of functioning. Minority, low income, urban settings, \\"at-risk\\", and other negative connotations labeling youth's hinder academic achievements. Effective after-school programs can try to bridge the gap between education achievement and the negatively-labeled student.  Behavioral growth  There's mixed evidence as to whether afterschool programs positively impact youth behavioral outcomes. The Posner and Vandell study showed that students who had taken part in an after-school program also exhibited more emotional stability and signs of social adjustment than their counterparts. In particular, students in an after-school activity behaved better and adjusted more smoothly when transitioning to new grades or new schools, most notably in the transition from middle to high school. Other studies provided quantitative data in support of these behavioral benefits by showing that students who participate in an after-school program on average have less disciplinary citations, are suspended less, and are expelled less than their peers who do not participate in any activity. On the other hand, a study of after-school programs in Maryland found participants to engage in more rebellious behavior than non- participants.  Closing the achievement gap  After-school activities have had proven impacts on decreasing the gap in academic achievement between white students and students of color in the United States. In her 2005 study of efforts to address the racial achievement gap in urban areas, psychologist Julie Bryan noted that after-school activities can strongly benefit a student's socio-emotional health and academic performance. The students that she worked with identified extracurricular activities, after-school opportunities for academic aid, and summer enrichment programs as important contributions to their academic success and personal growth. One aspect of this success is that after-school activities give students the opportunity to deepen relationships with adult mentors, such as sports coaches, teachers, and community leaders. Research shows that having caring and supportive adult presences in the lives of students greatly increases their sense of self- worth, academic achievement, and capabilities for resiliency in the face of adverse circumstances like poverty and abuse. A 2000 study by Gutman and Migley connects the benefits of students having close relationships with caring adults with a decrease in the achievement gap.  Summer learning loss  After-school activities can play a role in combatting summer learning loss, which refers to the amount of academic skills that students lose during the summer holidays due to a lack of exposure to academic material. According to a series of 39 meta-analyses collected by Harris Cooper in a study on elementary and early childhood education, students' test scores drop significantly from the last day of school in the spring to the first day in the fall; on average, the summer break sets students back over a month. For primary and secondary school students, reading comprehension, in particular, is highly affected by summer learning loss. If students are able to participate in academic activities during the summer months, they are less likely to be at risk for summer learning loss. Currently, students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to have access to and participate in academic activities during the summer months, which gives them an advantage in academic achievement during the school year when compared to their peers with lower socioeconomic statuses.  Criticisms of after-school activities   Rigid structure  One criticism of after-school activities is that they provide too much rigidity within a child's life. Advocates of slow parenting believe that children should be allowed to develop their own ideas. Getting bored is a step towards having an idea for something else to do, and having little or no adult interference allows children to express their own creativity. Proponents of this theory argue that structured after-school programs have the potential to take away avenues for such creativity and self- expression amongst children. Similarly, the Taoist concept of wu wei, literally translated as \\"non-action,\\" supports spontaneity in daily life. Thus, while there may be some children that benefit from being supervised and pushed towards didactic goals through organized after-school activities, others might end up achieving more on their own, or with minimal supervision.  Indicative of overparenting  Another criticism of after-school activities is that participating in them has the potential to lead to increased stress and anxiety amongst students. Children participating in many organized after-school activities is one common symptom of overparenting. In overparenting, which is more common among middle or upper-class families, parents tend to heavily monitor their child's schedule for the sake of protecting their child or improving their social skills, academic development, and/or future prospects. This has the potential to lead to lasting psychological issues amongst children, such as poorly developed independence and coping skills, low self-esteem, and stress- and anxiety-related disorders. In her study The Price of Privilege, psychologist Madeline Levine examined the psychological effects of overparenting on socioeconomically privileged children, including the impact of participating in after-school activities. She found that children of wealthy families were more likely to suffer psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. By spending so much time in organized after-school activities that their parents signed them up for, the children that Levine worked with failed to adequately develop self- management, which is a powerful precursor to both psychological inner strength and academic achievement.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, some icons are also believed to release such oil. According to Michael Ott, the term also refers to \\"the oil in the lamps that burn before the shrines of saints\\" or \\"the water that flows from the wells near their burial places\\", or \\"the oil and the water which have in some way come in contact with their relics.\\" Uses of the Oil According to Michael Ott: List of myroblyte saints * Demetrius of Thessaloniki * Nilus of Kynouria * Barbarus the Former Robber * Simon the Athonite * Saint Walpurga: \\"Famous among the oils of saints is the Oil of Saint Walburga (Walburgis oleum). It flows from the stone slab and the surrounding metal plate on which rest the relics of St. Walburga in her church in Eichst√§tt in Bavaria. The fluid is caught in a silver cup, placed beneath the slab for that purpose, and is distributed among the faithful in small vials by the Sisters of St. Benedict, to whom the church belongs. A chemical analysis has shown that the fluid contains nothing but the ingredients of water. Though the origin of the fluid is probably due to natural causes, the fact that it came in contact with the relics of the saint justifies the practice of using it as a remedy against diseases of the body and the soul. Mention of the oil of St. Walburga is made as early as the ninth century by her biographer Wolfhard of Herrieden (Acta Sanctorum, Feb., III, 562-3 and \\"Mon. Germ. Script., \\" XV, 535 sq.).\\" * Saint Menas: \\"In 1905-1908, thousands of little flasks with the inscription: EULOGIA TOU AGIOU MENA (Remembrance of St. Menas), or the like were excavated by C.M. Kaufmann at Baumma (Karm Abum) in the desert of Mareotis, in the northern part of the Libyan desert. The present Bumma is the burial place of the Libyan martyr Menas, which during the fifth and perhaps the sixth century was one of the most famous pilgrimage places in the Christian world. The flasks of Saint Menas were well known for a long time to archeologists, and had been found not only in Africa, but also in Spain, Italy, Dalmatia, France, and Russia, whither they had been brought by pilgrims from the shrine of Menas. Until the discoveries of Kaufmann, however, the flasks were supposed to have contained oil from the lamps that burned at the sepulchre of Menas. From various inscriptions on the flasks that were excavated by Kaufmann, it is certain that at least some, if not all, of them contained water from a holy well near the shrine of St. Menas, and were given as remembrances to the pilgrims. The so-called oil of St. Menas was therefore in reality, water from his holy well, which was used as a remedy against bodily and spiritual ailments.\\" * Saint Nicholas of Myra: \\"A fluid is said to emanate from the relics of Nicholas of Myra preserved at Bari in Italy since 1087.

Beard is best known for her work with Motown and as an original member of the singing group Martha and the Vandellas during the 1960s. Beard is currently known as a member of the singing group The Original Vandellas. Early years Born in Detroit, Michigan to Ann and Roger El Wood Beard, Annette started singing in church choirs at an early age. When she was fourteen, she was discovered by a man named Edward \\"Pops\\" Larkins, who was holding auditions for a female group at the local YMCA to complement a male group he had started. Fourteen-year-old Annette impressed him with a single note and she joined friends Rosalind Ashford and Gloria Williams to form the original version of The Del-Phis in 1957. The group performed at local get-togethers, high school parties, YMCA benefits and lawn parties. Annette, who was a shy girl growing up, did not mind singing background behind Gloria Williams, then the original lead singer of the group. Fellow Detroit singer Martha Reeves would replace a departing fourth member in 1960. In 1961, Annette graduated from Southeastern High School and Rosalind Ashford graduated from Wilbur Wright High School that same year. With graduation behind them, it was time for serious considerations of their options and what the future held for them. After changing their name to The Vels, the group recorded for local Motown subsidiaries Mel-O-Dy and Tamla usually singing background for local Detroit acts such as The Elgins' Saundra Mallett. In 1962, frustrated by the group's slow development and sensing a break-up, Williams left the group. Afterwards, Annette, Martha and Rosalind sang together on Marvin Gaye's hits \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\", \\"Hitch Hike\\" and \\"Pride and Joy\\". After replacing Mary Wells and The Andantes on a refuted session with a demonstration record for a Mickey Stevenson song, Motown president Berry Gordy suggested the girls to sign a contract as a recording group. With Reeves as the confirmed lead singer, the name Vandellas was chosen with the final name being Martha and the Vandellas. Career Martha and the Vandellas Signing to Motown Records' new Gordy subsidiary, Martha and the Vandellas gained a stature as hitmakers in the label almost as quickly after they were signed, boosted by their powerful backing behind Marvin's hit singles, their second single, \\"Come and Get These Memories\\", written by the fabled team of Holland-Dozier-Holland, became the group's first hit success. Distinguishing themselves from the two- lead format/traditional girl group pop sound of The Marvelettes and the doo- wop sensibilities of The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas employed a much rougher and sharper sound influenced by gospel. The group's third hit, \\"(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave\\", further established the group as recording stars. A third single, \\"Quicksand\\", continued that rise in late 1963. The Vandellas' sound was unique because of the difference in sounds between the three women: with Reeves' brassy alto leading the group, Rosalind Ashford Holmes provided the high vocals in her soprano voice while Beard provided the lower vocals in her contralto delivery making for an interesting and commercial sound. But Beard's rise to fame was overshadowed by a romance. Within a few months, Beard announced she was engaged and pregnant with her first child. Coming to grasp with wanting to stay in the group but also wanting to have a life of a married woman and mother, Beard opted to leave the group in June, 1964. Her last recording session with the group was the \\"Jimmy Mack / 3rd Finger Left Hand\\" session on June 18, 1964. Beard was replaced by former Velvelettes member Betty Kelly when she \\"retired\\" to care for her family and work for St John's Hospital in her native Detroit. Later years Having remained in touch with her former bandmates, Beard soon found herself back in the public eye following a reunion with Reeves and Ashford during a benefit concert for actor Will Geer in Los Angeles. In the mid-1980s, she and Rosalind filed suit against Motown for back royalties; several years before Reeves would do the same. Sensing a return to performing, she reunited again with Reeves and Ashford, releasing the \\"Heat Wave\\"-styled pop of \\"Step into My Shoes\\" in 1989. This reunion lead to several tours across the US and UK. In 1995, Beard joined Reeves, Ashford, Betty Kelly and Lois Reeves, as Martha and the Vandellas were inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In 2005, after 30 years of employment in the outpatient lab of Saint John's Hospital, Beard retired. As of 2011, Helton And Ashford separated from Reeves and Annette and Rosalind continue perform all over the world as \\"The Original Vandellas\\" with lead singer, Roschelle Laughhunn. Personal life Annette is currently married to Dann Simmons RN., of Ashland, Ohio.

As a rookie, Whitman was the pennant-contending Dodgers' starting left-fielder and #3 hitter on Opening Day, April 16 against the Boston Braves. Although he was held hitless in his first two National League games, he was Brooklyn's regular left-fielder for the season's first 13 games. On May 1, he started in center field and went five-for-five against the Chicago Cubs; the Dodgers won 5‚Äì1 to improve their record to 9‚Äì4 while Whitman's batting average rose to .263.Retrosheet: 1946 NL Batting Log But Whitman soon assumed the role of backup center-fielder to fellow rookie Carl Furillo, although he started another 40 games in center. In 104 games played, he collected 69 hits, 15 doubles, three triples, two home runs and 31 runs batted in‚Äîall of which were his MLB career bests. Whitman then spent with the Triple-A Montreal Royals, hitting .327 in 141 games. The Dodgers recalled him in September and used him in four contests, but he was ineligible for the 1947 World Series. The campaign saw Whitman get into 60 games for the Dodgers, with 38 starts in the Brooklyn outfield. He batted a career-high .291, but he also was sent back to Montreal for 40 games. Then, in , Whitman spent the full year with Brooklyn, but with drastically reduced playing time, his production slumped to a .184 batting average on only nine hits over 23 games. Nevertheless, he appeared in the 1949 World Series as a pinch hitter, striking out against Allie Reynolds of the New York Yankees in Game 4 on October 8 to close out a 6‚Äì4 Dodger defeat.Retrosheet box score: 1949 World Series Game 4 The Dodgers then sold Whitman's contract to the Phillies in November.

One of the team's veterans, Whitman was the Phils' most-used backup outfielder, starting 21 games and appearing in 75 contests overall. He batted .308 as a pinch-hitter, with 12 hits, and hit .250 overall. Then he made three appearances in the 1950 World Series as an emergency batsman, going 0-for-two with a base on balls. That season would be Whitman's last full year in the majors. In , he collected only two hits in 17 at bats as a pinch hitter and reserve outfielder for the Phillies, and was traded back to the Dodgers on June 8. Brooklyn sent him to Triple-A, and Whitman spent the next 4 years playing at the highest levels of the minors. Then, in 1956 and 1957, he was the player-manager of the San Jose JoSox of the Class C California League.

One afternoon, Peterson drove down to Mexico and the last town before he crossed the California/Mexico border was named Indio. At that point, Peterson decided he didn't want to use his own name on the album and decided to use Indio.An Exclusive Hits Interview with INDIO by Holly Gleason ¬©August 21, 1989 Big Harvest Big Harvest took two months to record. It involved several high-profile artists including Hamiltonian Bill Dillon and David Rhodes (Peter Gabriel) on guitars. Larry Klein played bass. Brenda Russell, also of Hamilton, sang background vocals, as did Joni Mitchell. Other collaborators included Indian violinist L. Subramaniam. The album appeared on the RPM 100 Chart in 1989.\\"RPM Top 100 Albums\\".
